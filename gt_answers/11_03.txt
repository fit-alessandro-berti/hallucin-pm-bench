Subject: Throughput Bottlenecks in Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)*

Analysis of 4 805 completed cases highlights three activities that materially breach service targets while accumulating the largest queues:

**Legal Approval** – average throughput **900 s** vs. 600 s SLA ( +300 s); waiting time 600 s.
**Risk Review** – average throughput **600 s** vs. 300 s SLA ( +300 s); waiting time 480 s.
**Credit Assessment** – average throughput **300 s** vs. 240 s SLA ( +60 s); waiting time 200 s.

**Recommended actions**
• Introduce rule-based pre-checks so low-risk files bypass full **Legal Approval**.
• Add one risk analyst to the peak morning window and automate external score retrieval for **Risk Review**.
• Deploy a “straight-through” heuristic for loans under €25 k to cut manual touch time in **Credit Assessment**.

Implementing these changes is projected to reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35 % and restore SLA compliance throughout the chain.
