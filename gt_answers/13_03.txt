2. “Manual Fraud Check” appears exactly once (case 1002 at 09:07:13). Because the sample is tiny—14 events spanning just three cases and <2 hours—a single occurrence swings the apparent frequency from 0 % to 7 % with one extra or missing line, giving a very wide confidence interval. Rare events therefore suffer extreme sampling error in small excerpts. In addition, near-synonyms such as “Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)” sit in the log; strict string matching excludes them, while fuzzy matching may over-include them, further distorting estimates. Only a much larger, randomly drawn slice—or the complete log—can yield a reliable prevalence for manual fraud checks.
