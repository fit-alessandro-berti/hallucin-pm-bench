**a) Decision points**

1. **Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check** – if the risk rating is **Low or Medium *and* the requested amount is ≤ €250 000**, the process bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise it proceeds to that review.
2. **“TriVote” approval gate** – the loan may advance only when at least **two of the three approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) record “Approve.”**

**b) Required documents (first-appearance order)**

1. Form 14B
2. Scorecard–Cyan
3. Scorecard–Magenta
4. Scorecard–Yellow
5. Deck Memo
6. Offer Sheet 77
7. Signed Offer Sheet 77
8. ID Matrix Declaration
