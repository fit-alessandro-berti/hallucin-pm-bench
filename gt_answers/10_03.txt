*Key points for the judge LLM*

* All four mandated terms appear **exactly** as specified and nowhere else.
* No disallowed synonyms (“Preliminary Assessment”, “CDD”, “Sanctions Check”, “risk rating”) leak into the output.
* “R, A” indicates the same role is both Responsible and Accountable; a dash (–) marks no involvement.
