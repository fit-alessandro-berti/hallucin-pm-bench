> The average cycle time of “Review Contract” **cannot be computed from the information provided**.
> **Reasoning:** The excerpt contains only case-id, activity name and resource; it lacks any timestamps, durations or ordering information. Without at least one temporal value per event, no cycle-time calculation is possible, so any numeric answer would be fabricated.
