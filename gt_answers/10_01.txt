**Notes for judge rubric**

* **Correctness**:

  * All three mandated synonyms appear (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) and the forbidden variants never occur.
  * RACI allocations reflect the narrative: each activity has exactly one *Responsible*; *Account Manager* is *Accountable* where appropriate.
* **Unwarranted content**: No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced.
* **Self-awareness**: N/A for this prompt (all information provided).
