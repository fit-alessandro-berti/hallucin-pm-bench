### **Expected answer (ground-truth key)**

| Rule | Status             | Justification (≤ 20 words)                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R1   | **Compliant**      | Manager then Finance approvals present for amount > €10 000.                                         |
| R2   | **Violated**       | Expedited; Ship\_Goods 05-Mar, but final approval after change is 07-Mar (> 2 days).                 |
| R3   | **Violated**       | Pay\_Invoice 06-Mar precedes Receive\_Goods 07-Mar.                                                  |
| R4   | **Not Applicable** | Trace has hazardous = false.                                                                         |
| R5   | **Violated**       | Change\_Request after approvals; Ship\_Goods and Pay\_Invoice occurred before new Manager\_Approval. |
| R6   | **Compliant**      | Case ends with Archive\_Record.                                                                      |

**Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT** (violations in R2, R3, R5).
