### Expected answer (gold standard)

**No – the trace is not compliant.**

**Justification**

| Rule | Assessment  | Reasoning                                                                                 |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | ✔ Satisfied | QE appears once and precedes RA.                                                          |
| 2    | ✔ Satisfied | Severity is High; VP occurs after both QE and RA.                                         |
| 3    | ❌ Violated  | NA occurs **before** RA is completed; NA must wait until **both** QE and RA are finished. |
| 4    | ✔ Satisfied | CC happens after NA (and after VP, as required).                                          |

Because rule 3 is violated, the overall trace is **non-compliant**.
