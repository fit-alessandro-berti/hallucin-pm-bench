### Expected (gold-standard) answer

**No**

The claim is false because there are clear counter-examples:

* In case C003, *Validate\_Payment* occurs first (line 6) and *Receive\_Order* only afterwards (line 7).
* Case C005 contains *Validate\_Payment* (line 11) but never contains *Receive\_Order* at all.
  These instances prove that *Validate\_Payment* does **not always** follow *Receive\_Order* in the provided log.
