**Yes — T5 can, and indeed must, fire before T3 if it is ever to occur.**

A valid firing sequence from the initial marking is:

1. **T1** (p0 → p1 + p2) → `p1 = 1, p2 = 1`
2. **T2** (p1 → p3)    → `p2 = 1, p3 = 1`
3. **T5** (p3, inhibitor p4) → `p2 = 1, p6 = 1` (enabled because `p3 ≥ 1` and `p4 = 0`)
4. **T3** (p2 → p4)    → `p4 = 1, p6 = 1` (now disables T5)
5. **T4** (p3 + p4 → p5) → `p5 = 1, p6 = 1`

**Justification**

* T5’s enabling condition is `p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0`.
* Transition T3 *adds* the first token to p4; once that happens, the inhibitor arc makes T5 permanently disabled (p4 is never emptied except together with p3 by T4, which simultaneously removes the last token of p3).
* Therefore the **only reachable markings that enable T5 are those where T3 has *not yet* fired**, so the ordering “T5 before T3” is reachable exactly as shown above.
