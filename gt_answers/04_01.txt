Non-compliant

Justification
1. **Rule 1 — Satisfied.**  The PO amount is €12 300 (> €10 000).  
   Two approvals occur in the correct order (Procurement Officer at event 2,
   CFO at event 3) before `Issue_PO` (event 5).

2. **Rule 2 — Violated.**  `Expedite_Flag` is present (event 4), therefore
   `Risk_Assessment` must precede the first `Ship_Goods`.  
   In the trace, `Ship_Goods` is event 8 and `Risk_Assessment`
   is event 9 → order is reversed.

3. **Rule 3 — Violated.**  `Goods_Received` is event 6; the next two activities
   are events 7 and 8.  `Three_way_match` occurs only at event 10
   (distance = 3), exceeding the allowed window.

4. **Rule 4 — Satisfied.**  The only Intern activity (event 7) does **not**
   directly follow a CFO activity; event 4 (`System`) lies in between.

5. **Rule 5 — Satisfied.**  `Archive_Record` is the final event (event 11)
   and no activity follows it.

Because at least one rule is violated (rules 2 & 3), the trace is overall
**NON-COMPLIANT**.
