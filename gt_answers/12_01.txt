**Short verdict:** The fact is **inaccurate**.

**Justification (evidence-based)**

* **Case 1001:** `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund` (lines 3-4), so the claimed ordering is reversed.
* **Case 1002:** `Update_Inventory` never appears, so “always” is already disproved.
* **Case 1003:** `Update_Inventory` again happens **before** `Authorize_Refund` (lines 11 & 14), not after it.

Since in none of the three cases does `Authorize_Refund` immediately precede `Update_Inventory`, the statement is false.
