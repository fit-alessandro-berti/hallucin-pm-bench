**Yes — T5 can fire before T3.**
A shortest firing sequence that achieves this order is:

```
1. T1   (p0 → pa + pb)     marking: pa 1, pb 1
2. T2b  (pa → pd)          marking: pd 1, pb 1
3. T4   (pb → pe)          marking: pd 1, pe 1
4. T5   (pd + pe → pf)     marking: pf 1          ← T5 fired before T3
5. T6   (pf → pc)          marking: pc 1
6. T3   (pc → pd)          marking: pd 1
```

**Why this works**

* The “shortcut” transition **T2b** lets the net create a token in **pd** without ever
  touching **pc**, so **T5** can already be enabled once **pe** is produced by **T4**.
* After **T5** fires, the feedback loop **T6** reinjects a token into **pc**,
  re-enabling **T3**; hence **T3** can still fire *after* **T5**, satisfying the
  required ordering.
* No shorter sequence exists:
  – T1 is mandatory to generate working tokens.
  – At least one of {T2, T2b} and T4 must fire to enable T5, giving a lower bound of
  four transitions (T1, {T2|T2b}, T4, T5).
  – Because **T3** consumes **pc**, T6 is required to put a token there once T5 has
  consumed **pd**, adding the two extra steps shown.

Therefore **〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉** is both *feasible* and *minimal*, proving
that **T5 can indeed occur before T3** in the reachability graph of the net.
