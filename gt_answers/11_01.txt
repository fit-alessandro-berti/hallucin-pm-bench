**Scoring notes for the judge LLM**

* **Correctness** – activities and numbers match the table.
* **No unwarranted content** – no other activities or service-time/throughput figures appear.
* **Action relevance** – each remedy is logically tied to the waiting-time problem and promises ≥ 20 % reduction without inventing unsupported data.
