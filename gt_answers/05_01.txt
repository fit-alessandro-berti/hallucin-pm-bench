Attach an interrupting boundary timer event (id="Timer_48h") to **Task_Receive** with
<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>.  
Add a new sequenceFlow from Timer_48h directly to existing **Task_Triage** (id="Task_Triage").  
If 48 hours pass without completion, the timer fires, bypassing any outstanding document requests and ensuring
the case reaches triage inside the SLA.  
No new tasks or subprocesses are introducedâ€”only one timer event and one sequence flow reuse existing elements.
