**Answer:** No.

**Justification (case-by-case)**

| Case | Sequence around *Receive\_Order*                      | Immediate successor? | Notes                                                 |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| C001 | Receive\_Order → **Validate\_Payment**                | ✅                    | Follows immediately.                                  |
| C002 | Receive\_Order → **Pack\_Items** → Validate\_Payment  | ❌                    | *Pack\_Items* intervenes before *Validate\_Payment*.  |
| C003 | Receive\_Order → **Validate\_Payment**                | ✅                    | Follows immediately.                                  |
| C004 | Receive\_Order → **Check\_Fraud** → Validate\_Payment | ❌                    | *Check\_Fraud* intervenes before *Validate\_Payment*. |

Because two out of the four cases (**C002** and **C004**) violate the stated rule, the claim that *Validate\_Payment* “always” occurs immediately after *Receive\_Order* is **inaccurate**.
