```
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines
```

*Rationale*

* **Create\_Documentation** and **Quality\_Check** are explicitly said to “begin in parallel right after Fabricate.”
* **Procure\_Materials** and **Schedule\_Machines** are said to “start immediately after Create\_Work\_Order and may run simultaneously.”
* No other tasks have overlap windows, so these are the **only** parallel-eligible pairs.
