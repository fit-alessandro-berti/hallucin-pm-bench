**Q1. Yes.**
T5 can fire before T3 because an alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) can create the required token in P5 while the original token in P2 is still available.

**Q2. Minimal firing sequence**

1. **T1** (M₁ = { P1, P2 })
2. **T2** (M₂ = { P2, P3 })
3. **T7** (M₃ = { P2, P4 })
4. **T4** (M₄ = { P2, P5 })
5. **T5** (M₅ = { P6 })

At step 5, T5 fires while T3 has not yet occurred.
Because T5 consumes the token in P2, T3 is subsequently disabled, confirming that T5 can indeed precede T3 in an admissible execution.
