8.5

The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains a minor error in Q3 that affects the completeness of the answer.

### **Q1: Score = 10.0**
- Correctly identified all three distinct cases (`C001`, `C002`, `C003`).

### **Q2: Score = 10.0**
- Accurately listed the sequence of activities for case `C002` in the correct order using the correct separator (`â†’`).

### **Q3: Score = 7.0**
- Correctly identified that `Check_Stock` precedes `Ship_Order` in `C001` and `C003`.
- Correctly identified that `Arrange_Delivery` precedes `Ship_Order` in `C002`.
- However, it only listed `Check_Stock` and `Arrange_Delivery` as the distinct activities preceding `Ship_Order`, but missed that `Check_Stock` appears twice (from `C001` and `C003`) and should still be listed only once. While this is not an error in the final listing (it is correct), the explanation incorrectly lists `Check_Stock` twice (once for `C001` and once for `C003`), which is redundant and should have been addressed. The answer lists all distinct activities correctly, but the explanation lacks precision in highlighting that `Check_Stock` is a single distinct activity even though it appears in two cases.

The overall answer is good but loses points due to the imprecision in the explanation.
