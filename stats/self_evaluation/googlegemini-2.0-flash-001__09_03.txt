**9.5**

**Rationale:**

*   The response correctly identifies that the required calculations cannot be performed due to the lack of data in the event log.
*   It accurately points out the specific missing data ('start\_time' and 'complete\_time') that are essential for calculating cycle time.
*   The explanation is concise and adheres to the one-paragraph requirement.
*   The answer avoids guessing or using external knowledge.
*   No tables are used.

The response is nearly perfect. The only reason for not assigning a full 10 is the slightly repetitive wording: it mentions "I cannot compute" at the beginning and then restates in the explanation. A more elegant phrasing could have avoided this repetition.
