**9.0**

**Rationale:**

The answer is very good. It correctly identifies all decision points and lists all documents in the correct order. The conditional inclusion of "Deck Memo" is also correctly stated.

A minor deduction of 1 point is motivated by the fact that the inclusion of the conditional aspect of the Deck Memo document is slightly verbose; it could have been included in a shorter parenthetical way.

No other errors are present.
