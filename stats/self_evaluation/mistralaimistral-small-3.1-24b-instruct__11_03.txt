7.4

The memo is generally well-structured and adheres to the instructions provided. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Minor mathematical error** in the memo affects the score most significantly. The Legal Approval activity exceeds the SLA by 300s (not 300). 600-300=300 (the delay is 300s not 300). Another similar error exists as well. The Risk Review exceeds the SLA by 300s (not 300).

Also it is better (depending on the context) to mention time with standards units: seconds, minutes, hours

2. **Assessment on criteria is not fully clear**: While the memo correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches and high waiting time, it could benefit from a clearer explanation of how these activities were selected.

3. Using of "latter stages" in the memo is not clear and inconsistent with the data at hand

4. While the score should reflect **zero tolerance to facts**: Invited phrases like “significant bottleneck”, “significant waiting time” step away from the data at hand. Ideally direct numbers should be provided at all acpects.

5. Original numbering of recommendations was not requested by the prompt.

These points contribute to a slight reduction in the overall score.
