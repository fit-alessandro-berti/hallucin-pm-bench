**9.0**

The answer is correct and gives a correct justification.

Reasons for deducting a point:
*   The justification is not *entirely* minimal (i.e., correct if you trimmed some words). For instance, it explicitly indicates the timestamp. This is superfluous, since the line number and activity name already pinpoint the event.
*   The second argument (C005) is not relevant to the "always follows" question. It would have been helpful if the response mentioned the fact that C005 only provides a counterexample if the question was "Validate\_Payment always follows Receive\_Order, *if* both activities are present in the same case". But that was not the question, so it is correct to argue the point is irrelevant. It is not *wrong* to include it, but it signals a lack of focus.
