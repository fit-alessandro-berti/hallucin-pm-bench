**Score: 8.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the parallel blocks for Process B â€” Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing. However, it misses one task in the third parallel block, which should include "Final_Inspection" alongside "Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware". This oversight results in a slight deduction from the maximum score.
