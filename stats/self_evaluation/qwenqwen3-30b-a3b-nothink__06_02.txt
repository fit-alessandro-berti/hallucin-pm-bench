The LLM answer is accurate and complete. It correctly identifies all three parallel blocks in Process B as described in the prompt:

1. "Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability" corresponds to Parallel Block P1.
2. "Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing" corresponds to Parallel Block P2.
3. "Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware" corresponds to Parallel Block P3.

The answer strictly adheres to the instructions by only including tasks from Process B, not mentioning any tasks from other processes, and excluding any sequentially executed tasks. The formatting is correct with numbered lines and tasks separated by commas. There are no errors or omissions.
