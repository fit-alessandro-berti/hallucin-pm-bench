The LLM successfully answered all three questions based on the provided XES event log fragment.

Q1: Correctly identified the 3 distinct cases.
Q2: Correctly listed the sequence of activities for case C002 in the correct order using the specified separator.
Q3: Correctly identified the two distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" and listed them alphabetically, one per line.

The answer is accurate and follows all instructions. A minor point reduction (0.5) is for the re-statement of the questions before providing the answers, which wasn't explicitly asked for and adds a little verbosity. Another minor point reduction (0.5) is for the bolding of the full answer which wasn't explicitly requested and potentially emphasizes the whole answer instead of just the core value/list. However, judged with "utmost strictness", these are very minor deviations. The core information needed is correct and presented as requested in terms of format.
