The LLM answer correctly identifies that the elapsed-time fields have been redacted, which means the average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract" cannot be directly calculated from the provided data. The response clearly states that the requested value **cannot be derived**, which aligns with the instruction to only answer if the question can be supported by the data.

However, the response loses points for not being concise enough. A more straightforward answer would be:

"The requested value **cannot be derived** because the elapsed-time fields have been redacted."

The additional explanation about how to perform the calculation if the elapsed times were available, while helpful, is not required given the context and instructions. A more direct and concise response would have scored higher.
