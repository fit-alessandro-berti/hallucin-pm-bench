**8.2**

Pros:
- The LLM correctly identifies all parallel blocks in Process B.
- The formatting is correct and easy to read.

Cons:
- Although rare, this high score doesn't have Cons by fitting the evaluation criteria.
Arguments:
Because it fails to include why the answer is correct, I decided not to put 10.0, even though the answer is completely correct.
