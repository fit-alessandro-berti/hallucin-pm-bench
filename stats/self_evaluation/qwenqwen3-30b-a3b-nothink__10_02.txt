1.5

The LLM answer contains several critical violations of the vocabulary mandate and has other significant issues:

1. **Vocabulary violations**: 
   - "Payment Clerk" is used instead of "Transaction Analyst" (this is a major issue, as the role is directly specified in the prompt).
   - "Compliance Officer" is used where "Regulatory Liaison" should be (multiple times).
   - "IT Support" is used, which is not one of the mandated roles.

2. **Missing roles**: 
   - The mandated roles are "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst", but the LLM has used "Compliance Officer" and "IT Support", which are not allowed.

3. **Improper use of roles**: 
   - The "Regulatory Liaison" is wrongly used as both "Consulted" and "Informed" in some cases, but the role should only be used where the mandated activity ("KYC Review") is performed.
   - "Transaction Analyst" is incorrectly assigned to "Release payment" instead of being used for the actual task of "KYC Review".

4. **Incomplete RACI table**: 
   - Several tasks from the source text (e.g., "notify compliance officer") are not reflected in the table.
   - The RACI matrix does not match the original 7 tasks listed in the prompt.

5. **Incorrect assignment**: 
   - "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case closure" is included, but "Regulatory Liaison" should not be the one being notified, based on the sourced text, which says "the compliance officer is notified."

This answer fails to meet the strict vocabulary and role requirements and does not accurately represent the process described in the prompt.
