**3.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the inaccuracy of the FACT, but there are significant flaws and inaccuracies in the justification provided.

- **CaseID C002**: The sequence is indeed `Receive_Order -> Pack_Items -> Validate_Payment`, which contradicts the FACT correctly.
- **CaseID C004**: The sequence is `Receive_Order -> Check_Fraud -> Validate_Payment`, which also correctly contradicts the FACT.

However, the LLM misses out on mentioning another contradictory sequence:
- **CaseID C003:** The sequence is `Receive_Order -> Validate_Payment -> Ship_Order`, which is inconsequential to the FACT discussed but relevant for a complete view.

Moreover, the justification could have been more comprehensive by including all relevant cases and verifying the remaining cases that do follow the FACT to show a complete picture. This thoroughness is lacking, which significantly reduces the score. Additionally, the justification should have explicitly stated that cases C001 and C003 do not contradict the FACT, even though they are not part of the counter-evidence.

Errors in completeness and thoroughness justify the lower score.
