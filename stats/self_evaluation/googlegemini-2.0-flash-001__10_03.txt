**Rationale:**

*   **Vocabulary Violations:** The LLM fails miserably at adhering to the vocabulary policy. It correctly translates "Preliminary Assessment" to "Intake Vetting," but then incorrectly translates the other activities. It should have translated "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)" to "KYC Review", "Sanctions Check" to "AML Screening, and "risk rating" to "Risk Scoring". However, it at least remembers not to add synonyms.
*   **Incomplete RACI Matrix:** The matrix is incomplete. The "Accountable" roles are missing for the "Intake Vetting" activity, the "Consulted" roles are missing, the "Informed" roles are completely missing, and Treasury Ops is missing.
*   **Incorrect Role Assignments:** In the process narrative, once the Compliance Officer approved the case, Treasury Ops would release the funds. Thus, the "Release Funds" activity is missing, and the Treasury Ops role isn't assigned to anything. Furthermore, the Front-Office Analyst isn't listed as "Informed" when Treasury Ops releases funds and notifies the originating analyst.

This result indicates a very poor understanding and application of the given instructions and constraints.
