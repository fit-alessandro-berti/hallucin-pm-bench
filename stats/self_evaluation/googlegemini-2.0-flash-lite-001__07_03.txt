The answer is very good, it follows all instructions precisely, including the required formatting.

Only minor flaws:
*   While it did not contain *incorrect* details, the `removed tasks` section is inaccurate, in the sense that it should have listed the id and name of the removed task, as requested.
*   It would have been *slightly* better to retain the original order of the tasks while writing the answer, but the relative order of tasks in the BPMN model itself wasn't enforced.
