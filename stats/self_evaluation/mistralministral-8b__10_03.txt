**Score: 5.0**

The LLM answer contains several significant errors:

1. The term "Preliminary Assessment" is used instead of "Intake Vetting" for the first activity.
2. The term "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)" is used instead of "KYC Review" for the second activity.
3. The term "Sanctions Check" is used instead of "AML Screening" for the third activity.
4. The term "risk rating" is used instead of "Risk Scoring" for the fourth activity.
5. The term "escalation for review" is used instead of "Escalation for Review" for the fifth activity.

These errors are not minor and reflect a significant loss of points.
