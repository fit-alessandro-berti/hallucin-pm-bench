**9.5**

**Rationale:**

The LLM correctly identifies the parallel tasks within Process B, ignores Process A, and adheres to the specified formatting and ordering requirements (alphabetical within pairs and overall).

*   The identified pairs `Create_Documentation — Quality_Check` and `Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines` are, in fact, the only parallel tasks in the description of Process B.
*   These pairs are presented in the requested format.
*   The pairs are in correct alphabetical order (`Create_Documentation` before `Procure_Materials`).
*   Within each pair, the tasks are also in alphabetical order.

Therefore, the answer is perfect, and deserves a score close to perfect. I deduct just a small amount because the overall performance is still dependent on following instructions precisely on a well-defined problem, with no creative insight.
