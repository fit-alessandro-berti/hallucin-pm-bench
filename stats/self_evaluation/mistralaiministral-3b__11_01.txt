**Score: 8.5/10**

The LLM answer is mostly accurate and meets the requirements outlined in the prompt. However, it lacks a few key elements:

1. **Total Executions**: The total number of executions is not included in the memo, which is a minor oversight.
2. **Service-Time**: While the prompt specifically asks not to discuss service-time, the LLM's mention of "Avg. Service Time" is an error.

Despite these minor issues, the memo is well-structured, provides the required data, and offers concrete actionable recommendations for each of the three worst-performing activities. The score is slightly below 9 due to these minor errors.
