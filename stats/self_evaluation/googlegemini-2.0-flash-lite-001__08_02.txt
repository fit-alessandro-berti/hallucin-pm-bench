The answer is correct, providing a "No" for Question 1 and a correct explanation. The explanation is also under 120 words. However, the provided order of T2-T4-T3 to fire T5 is not entirely correct -- T2 MUST fire before T4, but T3 does not need to follow T2. T3 could be concurrent with T2, which impacts the order of the firing sequence. While the final conclusion is correct, the explanation could be better and that impacts the score.
