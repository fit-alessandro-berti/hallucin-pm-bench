The LLM identifies both pairs of parallel activities correctly based *only* on Process B, as requested. It also presents the pairs in the specified format and order (alphabetical within the pair and alphabetical in the overall list).

The only very minor issue is that the prompt explicitly asked for "every pair", and while it *only* provides the valid parallel pairs, a pedantic strictness might interpret this as missing the pairs that *cannot* be executed in parallel. However, given the context of "parallel according to the description", the interpretation provided by the LLM is the standard and intended one in this context. The formatting is perfect. Because the instructions were followed so closely otherwise, this very minor ambiguity isn't a significant deduction.
