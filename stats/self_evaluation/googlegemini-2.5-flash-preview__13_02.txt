The response is excellent in answering the direct questions accurately and providing a concise, relevant explanation for the implications of low-support activities. The calculations are correct and rounded as requested.

The only minor point, which I am reflecting with a very small point deduction, is that the format of the answer is not strictly speaking "only from the data supplied". The preamble "Here are the answers based *only* on the provided log data:" while helpful, is not literally derived from the log data provided. However, given the instruction `You answer **only** from the data supplied`, this is a very strict interpretation. The core answers are indeed derived *only* from the data.
