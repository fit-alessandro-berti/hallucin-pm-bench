**Score: 9.0**

The LLM answer is mostly correct, but there are a few minor errors that need to be pointed out:

1. **Q1:** The number of distinct cases is correctly identified as 3.
2. **Q2:** The sequence of activities for case "C002" is correctly listed, but there is a small error in the format. It should be:
   ```
   1. Receive_Order
   →
   2. Check_Stock
   →
   3. Ship_Order
   ```
   This minor formatting issue results in a small deduction in the score.
3. **Q3:** The list of activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" is correctly identified, but it is missing an activity that should be included. The correct list should be:
   ```
   1. Check_Stock
   2. Receive_Order
   3. Receive_Order
   ```
   This minor oversight results in a small deduction in the score.

Overall, the LLM answer is accurate and provides the correct information, but the minor errors in formatting and completeness result in a score of 9.0 instead of 10.0.
