The LLM answer is correct, concise, and directly addresses the question. The user explicitly stated that no timestamps were released, and the event log header confirms that no time-related data is present. The answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be calculated due to the lack of timestamp information. There are no errors, and the response is fully aligned with the constraints provided.
