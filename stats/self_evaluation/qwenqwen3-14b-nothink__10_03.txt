The LLM answer has several critical issues that prevent it from receiving a higher score:

1. **Incorrect Activity Names**: The prompt explicitly stated that the LLM must use the strict vocabulary (e.g., "Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," "Risk Scoring"). The LLM correctly used these terms for the first four activities, but the remaining activities ("Approval (Risk >70)", "Payment Execution", "Notification") are not part of the original process narrative. These activities were not described in the narrative and thus should not be included in the RACI matrix. This is a major violation of the instructions.

2. **Missing Activities**: The original process narrative includes the following activities:  
   - Intake Vetting (performed by Front-Office Analyst)  
   - KYC Review (Compliance Analyst)  
   - AML Screening (Compliance Analyst)  
   - Risk Scoring (Compliance Analyst)  
   - Approval (Compliance Officer)  
   - Payment Execution (Treasury Ops)  
   - Notification (Treasury Ops)  

   The LLM included the last three activities, but the LLM did not include the “Approval” activity in the table entry, despite the need for Compliance Officer approval for risk >70. Instead, it mislabeled "Approval (Risk >70)" as an activity, which was not directly mentioned in the process narrative. This is a significant deviation from the required process narrative.

3. **Role Assignments**: While the matrix reflects the roles correctly where applicable, it fails to fully represent the "Accountable" role for the Compliance Officer in the "Risk Scoring" activity, as per the process narrative where the Compliance Officer approves cases exceeding 70. The matrix should reflect the Compliance Officer as "Accountable" during the Risk Scoring phase, but this is not captured.

4. **Synonym Usage**: The answer did not use synonyms for the strict terms listed in the vocabulary policy, which is a positive point. However, the addition of "Approval (Risk >70)" violates the instruction to not rename or add activities.

5. **Table Formatting**: The table is correctly formatted in Markdown, but the content is inconsistent with the prompt's process narrative.

In summary, while some elements align with the instructions, the addition of unauthorized activities and the omission/misrepresentation of key process elements result in a significant loss of points.
