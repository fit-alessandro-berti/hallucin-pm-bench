The LLM answer provides a clear and mostly accurate RACI table. However, there are a few issues:

1. **Inconsistency in Task Descriptions**: The first three tasks are described as "Receive customerâ€™s transfer instruction," "Log the transfer instruction in the system," and "Screen the payment against the sanctions list," but in the RACI table, these are attributed to the "Transaction Analyst." This is inconsistent with the informal description which uses "payment clerk."

2. **Inappropriate Role for KYC Review**: The task "Perform KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary" is attributed to the "Regulatory Liaison," which is not appropriate. According to the informal description, this task should be performed by the "compliance officer."

3. **Lack of Consultation for High-Risk Approval**: The task "Approve high-risk transaction" should involve consultation with someone, but the RACI table does not include any role in the "Consulted" column.

4. **Notification of Compliance Officer**: The task "Notify the compliance officer" is attributed to "IT Support," which is not clear in the informal description.

These issues lead to a significant loss of points, but the table is generally well-organized and uses the mandated vocabulary correctly.
