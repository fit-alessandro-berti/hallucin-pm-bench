**Score: 9.0**

The LLM answer is largely accurate and follows the required format. However, there are a couple of minor issues:

1. In R2, the justification should specify that the last required approval was Manager_Approval, not Finance_Approval.
2. In R3, the justification should specify that Pay_Invoice occurred after Receive_Goods, not before.

These minor errors result in a slight deduction from the maximum score. Overall, the response is thorough and correct, justifying a score of 9.0.
