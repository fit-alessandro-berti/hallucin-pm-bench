**Score: 8.5**

The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains a minor error in the percentage calculation for the second question. The correct calculation should be `(1 / 18) * 100 = 5.56%`, but the LLM answer rounds it to `5.56%`. This minor error does not significantly impact the overall correctness of the answer, but it does slightly reduce the score. The other parts of the answer are accurate and well-explained.
