The answer is mostly correct but has a minor inaccuracy that justifies a slight deduction. The explanation for Q1 is accurate: T5 requires P2 and P5, and P5 can only be marked after T4, which requires T3. However, the statement "T1 → T3 → T4 → T5" in Q2 is misleading because T1 is not directly required for T3 to fire. T1 is the initial transition that creates P2, which is needed for T3, but the dependency chain is not strictly linear as implied. A more precise dependency would be "T1 → T3 → T4 → T5" if T1 is part of the sequence, but the answer overstates the direct dependency. The word limit is respected, and the explanation is concise and mostly accurate.
