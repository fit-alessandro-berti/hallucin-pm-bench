**Reasoning:**

*   **Q1:** Correct. (3 distinct case IDs)
*   **Q2:** Correct. (Pack\_Items precedes Ship\_Order in case A-9321)
*   **Q3:** Correct. (Earliest timestamp is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00)
*   **Q4:** Correct. (Quality\_Check occurs twice)
*   **Q5:** Mostly Correct, only one minor mistake here, receive order *does* appear as a first event, so it made a wrong consideration here in the list. (Validate\_Order, Pack\_Items, Ship\_Order and Quality\_Check)

The response adheres to the JSON schema and provides mostly correct answers based on the provided event log. The only error is on Q5 on the activity "Receive\_Order" which should not be on the list.
