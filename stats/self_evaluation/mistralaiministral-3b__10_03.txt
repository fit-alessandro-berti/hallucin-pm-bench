**Score: 6.5/10**

The LLM answer mostly adheres to the strict vocabulary policy, but there are a few notable oversights:

1. **Intake Vetting:** The LLM correctly identifies the Front-Office Analyst as responsible for this activity.
2. **KYC Review:** The LLM correctly identifies the Compliance Analyst as responsible for this activity.
3. **AML Screening:** The LLM correctly identifies the Compliance Analyst as responsible for this activity.
4. **Risk Scoring:** The LLM correctly identifies both the Front-Office Analyst and Compliance Analyst as responsible for deriving the risk score, and the Compliance Officer as accountable for the final approval of cases exceeding 70.
5. **Escalation for Compliance Officer Approval:** The LLM correctly identifies the Compliance Officer as accountable for the approval.
6. **Approval for Payment:** The LLM correctly identifies the Compliance Officer as accountable for the approval.
7. **Funds Release:** The LLM correctly identifies Treasury Ops as responsible for releasing the funds.
8. **Notification to Originating Analyst:** The LLM correctly identifies Treasury Ops as responsible for notifying the originating analyst.

However, the LLM incorrectly uses "Preliminary Assessment" instead of "Intake Vetting" for the activity performed by the Front-Office Analyst, and it does not mention "Escalation for Compliance Officer Approval" in the matrix. These oversights result in a score of 6.5/10.
