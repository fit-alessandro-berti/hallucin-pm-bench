The answer is mostly correct and follows all the instructions flawlessly. The only minor flaw is that the wording could be slightly more precise. Instead of "Here's the enumeration of concurrent tasks for Process B:" it could have said "The concurrent tasks for Process B are:" or even just started with the numbered list directly. This is very minor, but reflects in a slightly lower score because I was asked to be extremely strict.
