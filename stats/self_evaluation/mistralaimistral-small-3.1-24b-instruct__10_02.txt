**4.5/10.0**

The response largely fits the relevant task but has several issues that necessitate point reductions:

1. **Consistency in Terminology:** The term “KYC Review” was correctly utilized. I will deduct 0.5 points for the deviations within the Informed column.
2. **Accuracy of Roles:** Used mandated roles in incorrect positions, particularly in "Release the approved payment" assignment where the Transaction Analyst is responsible without involvement of the Regulatory Liaison
3. **Process Incompleteness:** Lack of the “*Must be notified end transaction*” management action.

Here’s a suggested improvement:
