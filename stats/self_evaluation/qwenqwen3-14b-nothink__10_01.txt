7.5

The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains several issues that warrant a reduction in score due to the strict evaluation criteria:

1. **Correct Terminology Usage (Score: 10/10)** – The LLM strictly used the required terms: “KYC Review,” “Order Vetting,” and “Payment Clearance,” without using the forbidden terms. This is a strong point.

2. **Mapping Roles to Activities (Score: 8/10)** – The mapping of roles to activities is mostly correct based on the description provided:
   - **Receive Application** → AM (Correct)
   - **KYC Review** → CO (Correct)
   - **Order Vetting** → AM (Correct)
   - **Payment Clearance** → FC (Correct)
   - **Record Update** → IT (Correct)
   - **Notify Customer** → AM (Correct)
   
   However, it assumes that each activity is only **responsible (R)** by one role. While the process description says that these roles perform the tasks, the RACI matrix usually indicates accountability or ownership, not just responsibility. Thus, the lack of **A**, **C**, or **I** entries is not necessarily an error but could be considered an incomplete matrix. However, the user explicitly said "not used in this process" in the legend, so this is acknowledged.

3. **Legend Clarification (Score: 7/10)** – The LLM included a legend, which is good, but it should be more explicitly tied to the process. For example, stating that no one is accountable, consulted, or informed in this RACI matrix is not standard practice unless justified.

4. **Formatting (Score: 9/10)** – The table is well-formatted and aligns with the requirements. However, the use of **bold** and the legend should be consistent with industry standards for RACI matrices.

5. **Omission of Explanation (Score: 6/10)** – The LLM did not explain **why** only the **R** column is used in the matrix, which could be considered an omission in a professional setting. While the user didn't explicitly ask for it, it would be more informative to justify the lack of **A**, **C**, or **I** roles.

6. **Conclusion (Score: 7/10)** – The LLM said, “Let me know if you’d like it visualized in a table format or exported for use in a project management tool.” This adds a helpful follow-up, but the user likely expected a complete and definitive answer without needing clarification.

**Overall Score: 7.5/10**  
The matrix is technically compliant with the terminology and process mapping, but it could be more thorough and clear in justifying the use of only **R** in the matrix, especially in a professional consulting context. It also slightly overcomplicates the explanation with an unnecessary legend for **A**, **C**, and **I**, which were not used.
