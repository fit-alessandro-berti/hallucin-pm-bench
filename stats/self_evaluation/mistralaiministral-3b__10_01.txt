**Score: 8.0**

**Explanation:**
- The LLM correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy, using "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" instead of the forbidden terms.
- The RACI matrix is well-structured and accurately reflects the responsibilities of each role.
- The explanation provided is clear and concise, accurately describing the responsibilities for each activity.
- However, there are minor errors in the RACI matrix:
  - In the "Receive Application" row, the Account Manager (AM) should be marked as "R" (Responsible), not "C" (Consulted).
  - In the "Notify Customer" row, the Account Manager (AM) should be marked as "R" (Responsible), not "C" (Consulted).
- These minor errors result in a slight deduction from the maximum score.
