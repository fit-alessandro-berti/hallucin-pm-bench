The LLM answer incorrectly identifies a violation of Rule 3, stating that `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA). However, the trace shows that NA occurs after QE and RA, which means Rule 3 is not violated. This error significantly impacts the accuracy of the evaluation.
