8.0

The LLM answer accurately identifies that the detailed event log is necessary to compute the requested metrics and that it has been redacted for privacy. The response clearly states the reasons why the calculations cannot be performed. However, the answer could be improved by providing a more precise definition of what is needed to perform the calculations (i.e., the specific columns and data points required). 

Additionally, the LLM answer provides some context from Artefact B but correctly refrains from using outside information or making guesses. The response is concise and clearly written. 

A deduction of 2 points is made because the LLM answer does not explicitly address the request to respond in plain text and does not provide any numerical examples or formulas that could be used if data were available. Moreover, the answer could be more concise in its explanation. 

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the task and the limitations imposed by the redacted data, but it falls short of a perfect score due to minor issues with clarity and concision.
