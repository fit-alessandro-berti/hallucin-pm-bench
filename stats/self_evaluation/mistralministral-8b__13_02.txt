**Score: 7.0**

The LLM answer is mostly accurate but contains a minor error in the percentage calculation for unique cases. The correct percentage should be 8.33% (1/12), but the LLM rounded it to 8.33% (1/12). This small error is significant in this context because it reflects a misunderstanding of the data. However, the overall analysis is correct, and the explanation is clear and concise.
