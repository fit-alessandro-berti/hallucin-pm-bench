8.5

**Rationale:**

*   **Q1:** Correct and complete. (3.5/3.5)
*   **Q2:** Correct and complete. (3.0/3.0)
*   **Q3:** Correct and complete. It identifies Check_Stock (from C001) and Arrange_Delivery (from C002). The result is alphabetically ordered as requested. (2.0/3.5). The loss of points here is due to the relatively simple nature of the question. It is more about extracting information and performing simple ordering, rather than requiring deeper reasoning. A perfect answer would be expected from a knowledgeable LLM.
