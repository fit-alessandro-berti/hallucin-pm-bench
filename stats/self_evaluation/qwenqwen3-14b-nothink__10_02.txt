The LLM answer shows a basic attempt to follow the instructions, but it contains several significant issues:

1. **Incorrect role names**: The LLM used "Transaction Analyst" for tasks that were originally assigned to a "payment clerk" (e.g., tasks 1, 2, 5). While this may be a reasonable interpretation, the prompt explicitly asks to **replace** "payment clerk" with "Transaction Analyst", which should be done without ambiguity. The LLM at least used the correct mandated terms, so this is partially correct.

2. **Incorrect mapping of "compliance officer" to "Regulatory Liaison"**: This was correctly done, which is a plus.

3. **Missing "Consulted" and "Informed" columns for relevant roles**: For example, in step 5, "IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent" â€” IT Support should be the *Responsible* party here, but the LLM did not assign them any role in the table. This indicates incomplete understanding.

4. **Misinterpretation of "notified" as "Informed"**: While this is technically correct, the LLM did not identify the *Responsible* party for notifying the compliance officer. Instead, it labeled "Notified of the case file archive" as an "Informed" task with no one assigned, which is incomplete.

5. **Incorrect task phrasing**: The final task "Notified of the case file archive" appears in the table as a task, but it should be "Notifies the compliance officer of the case file archive" with the *Responsible* party being IT Support.

6. **Missing "Consulted" and "Informed" entries where applicable**: For example, in Task 3, the Regulatory Liaison is responsible, but no one is marked as "Consulted" or "Informed", which may be appropriate, but if it was required, it's missing.

Overall, the LLM attempted to follow the vocabulary mandates but failed to fully understand the RACI matrix requirements and task delegation as outlined in the source text. The RACI table lacks completeness and some tasks are misaligned with the correct roles.
