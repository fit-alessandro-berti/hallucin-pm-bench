8.5

The LLM answer provided a clear and well-structured executive memo that addressed the prompt's requirements. Here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses:

Strengths:

* The memo correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities by waiting time: Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, and Assess_Liability.
* It provides both the average waiting time and the 95th-percentile waiting time for each activity.
* The recommendations for each activity are concrete and data-driven.

Weaknesses:

* The memo is slightly above the 150-word limit, but it's still readable and concise.
* The recommendations, although good, could be more specific in terms of expected outcomes or implementation details. However, given the strict word limit, it's a reasonable trade-off.
* There are no minor errors in terms of formatting, grammar, or content.

To reach a perfect score, the memo could be slightly more concise, and the recommendations could be more detailed. However, considering the strict requirements and the overall quality of the response, an 8.5 score is justified.
