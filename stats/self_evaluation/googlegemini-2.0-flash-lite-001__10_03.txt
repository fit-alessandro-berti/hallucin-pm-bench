The answer attempts to adhere to the vocabulary policy by using the correct phrases. However, it fails in a very significant way: it *uses* the correct vocabulary, but it's *incorrect* in what activities it includes, and it hallucinated new activities.

Specifically, the prompt clearly dictates the activities to cover, and the LLM creates/introduces several activities that are NOT in the narrative that was provided: "Schedule Payment", "Release Funds", and "Notify Originating Analyst". This is a substantial failure as it changes the requirements of the instructions. The matrix includes activities NOT described in original narrative.

While the format is correct, and it *tries* to use the correct vocabulary, the failure to follow the core instruction of using the provided process narrative makes this a failure.
