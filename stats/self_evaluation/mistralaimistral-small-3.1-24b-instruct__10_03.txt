The LLM answer correctly follows the strict vocabulary policy for three out of the four required terms, but it fails to use the correct term for the first activity, referring to it as "Intake Vetting" instead of the incorrect term used in the prompt ("Preliminary Assessment"). Additionally, the LLM incorrectly capitalizes "Approval" and "Fund Transfer" in the activity column, which are not activities but actions derived from the process narrative. Furthermore, the term "Notification" is not an activity described in the prompt, and it should not be included in the matrix. These errors significantly detract from the accuracy and completeness of the response.
