The answer is mostly correct and follows the required format. Here's a breakdown:

*   **R1: Compliant** - Correct, the amount is over the limit, and approvals are in the right order. Justification is concise.
*   **R2: Violated** - Correct. Expedited is true, and the shipping is not within 2 days after the latest approval. Concise.
*   **R3: Violated** - Correct. Pay_Invoice happened before Receive_Goods. Concise.
*   **R4: Not Applicable** - Correct. Not hazardous, no inspection needed. Concise.
*   **R5: Compliant** - Correct. Change request triggers the new manager approval. Concise.
*   **R6: Compliant** - Correct. The event trace ends with Archive\_Record. Concise.
*   **Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT** - Correct, based on the violations of R2 and R3.

**Minor Deductions:**

*   While the justifications are concise, some could be *slightly* more explicit (e.g., mentioning the exact date discrepancies for R2 and R3) without exceeding the length constraint. However, the conciseness is appreciated.
*   No critical flaws.

The solution demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and the scenario. The reasoning is sound, and the answer adheres to the formatting requirements.
