**6.5**

The answer is mostly correct but loses points for the following reasons:

1. **Minor Calculation Error**: The calculation for the percentage in question 2 is correct, but the explanation could be clearer. The use of brackets around the calculation is unnecessary and slightly confusing.
2. **Grammatical Consistency**: In question 3, the phrase "The case identifier that contains‚Äù should be "The case identifiers that contain" to correctly reflect the possibility of multiple cases.
3. **Clarity and Precision**: The response is generally clear but could be more precise in its language, especially in the explanation of the sampling-related reasons. For example, specifying "only a single day's worth of activities" could be more explicitly tied to the unreliability of the estimate.
4. **Formatting**: The formatting of the response is good but could be improved for better readability, especially in the explanation of the sampling-related reasons.

Overall, the response is quite good but could benefit from more precise language and clearer formatting.
