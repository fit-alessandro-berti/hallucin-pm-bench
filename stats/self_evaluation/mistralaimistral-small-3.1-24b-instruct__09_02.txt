**2.0**:

Reasoning:

The LLM answered correctly but there is no information about why this is the correct answer. The information that the " cycle time calculation requires timestamps is not mentioned. Hence the reason for the low score.
While the explanation is concise, it lacks thoroughness expected from a senior process-mining analyst.
The use of bold markers around the phrase Dual Authorization was poor as well because User also already used such markers in the question. The LLM should rather write it without the extra styling unless asked explicitly to.
The field details were used to wrong purpose and are within one phrase which also adds no value.

Instead, the answer should likely have looked like this:
The average cycle time for the activity “Dual Authorization” cannot be determined with the provided information. The computation of the cycle time requires timestamps which are missing because only high-level frequency data were provided by the bank.
Honesty Time: These are also the reasons why this answer has been given a low grading (mercilessly).
