**5.5**  
The LLM answer contains several significant errors that undermine its accuracy and compliance with the strict evaluation criteria. Here’s the breakdown:

- **R1: Compliant** – Correct. The PO is over €10k and has both Manager and Finance Approval in order.  
- **R2: Violated** – Incorrect. The LLM claims Ship_Goods occurred 2 days after the last approval, but the last approval was on 2025-03-04 (Finance_Approval), and Ship_Goods was on 2025-03-05, which is **exactly 1 calendar day**, not 2. The rule says "within 2 calendar days", so this is **compliant**. The LLM incorrectly labeled this as violated.  
- **R3: Violated** – Correct. Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) occurred **before** Receive_Goods (2025-03-07).  
- **R4: Not Applicable** – Correct. Hazardous = false, so no Safety_Inspection required.  
- **R5: Compliant** – Incorrect. The Change_Request occurred after **some** approvals (Manager_Approval had already occurred), so a **new Manager_Approval** was required **before** any further processing. However, the new Manager_Approval happened **after** Pay_Invoice and Store_Goods, which are further processing steps. This is a **violation** of R5.  
- **R6: Compliant** – Correct. Archive_Record is present.  

Overall, the answer is **NON-COMPLIANT**, but the LLM incorrectly labeled R2 as violated (when it was compliant) and R5 as compliant (when it was violated). These errors significantly impact the validity of the evaluation. The justification is also too vague in some cases (e.g., "Change_Request after approval triggered new Manager_Approval" is not a proper 20-word justification). The conclusion is correct, but the reasoning is flawed.
