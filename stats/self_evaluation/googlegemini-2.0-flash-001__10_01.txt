3.0

**Rationale for the score:**

The answer is fundamentally flawed despite getting some aspects correct. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Terminology Violations (Major Deduction):** The prompt *explicitly* forbids the use of "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", and "Payment Processing" and enforces "KYC Review", "Order Vetting" and "Payment Clearance" instead. The response unfortunately completely violates the enforced terms.

*   **Missing elements.** The prompt asks for a RACI matrix. The response only provides R assignment, and omits A, C, and I, which is a significant failure to fulfill specifications and reduces its usefulness.

*   **Format Correctness (Minor Positive):** The basic formatting of the table using markdown is correct.

**In summary:** The LLM fails on core instructions of the prompt and, as such, is an unusable deliverable with critical errors.
