The LLM answer is partially correct but contains a significant error. The task specifically asked to list every pair of tasks in *Process B* that can be executed in parallel. The answer correctly identifies:

1. `Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines` (correct)

However, it misses:

2. `Quality_Check  —  Create_Documentation` (also correct, but the answer includes this as part of the same line with an incorrect slash separator instead of a line break)

The answer fails to follow the instruction to "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list" and also fails to provide one pair per line. Instead, it uses a slash to separate the pairs on the same line, which is not compliant with the formatting instructions.

Additionally, the answer does not list the pairs in alphabetical order within the list (though both pairs are alphabetically correct on their own). The main issue is the incorrect formatting and failure to separate the pairs into distinct lines.
