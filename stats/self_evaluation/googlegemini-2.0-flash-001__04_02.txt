**7.5**

**Rationale:**

The answer is mostly correct and follows the requested format. However, there's a subtle error in rule R2 that merits a significant deduction.

*   **R1:** Correct (Compliant)
*   **R2:** **Incorrect** (Should be Violated): The last approval was on March 4th at 08:17 and Ship_Goods occurred on March 5th at 10:26. This is *more* than 2 calendar days. March 4th at 08:17 until midnight is 1 day and the remainder of the second day concludes nearly halftime in the morning of March 5th. It should have been within the remainder of March 4th plus March 5th. The model incorrectly states that "ship goods occurred within 2 days."
*   **R3:** Correct (Violated)
*   **R4:** Correct (Not Applicable)
*   **R5:** Correct (Compliant)
*   **R6:** Correct (Compliant)

*   **Final Conclusion:** Correct (NON-COMPLIANT due to R2 and R3) The final result should be NON-COMPLIANT which could arrive from R2 alone or R3 alone or from their combination.

The subtle error in R2 and the fact that the model didn't precisely determine the correct calendar day calculation is the reason for the lowered rating.
