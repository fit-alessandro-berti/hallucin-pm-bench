The answer is partially correct but contains significant issues that warrant a lower score. 

1. **The diff is incomplete**: It only shows a single line change (adding `camunda:executionListener="onStart"` to Flow_2), but the XML structure is not fully represented in the diff. The rest of the XML is missing, making it impossible to verify the full context of the change.

2. **The rationale is misleading**: The `executionListener="onStart"` attribute is not a standard SLA compliance mechanism. It does not directly impact SLA timing or ensure that the next task starts immediately after the previous one is completed. This is a misunderstanding of how Camunda's SLA features work. SLA compliance is typically managed through `camunda:dueDate` and `camunda:slaDueDate` attributes on tasks, not through execution listeners on sequence flows.

3. **The change may not address the SLA issue**: Even if the execution listener were relevant, the answer does not explain how this would improve SLA compliance. It also doesn't address any specific SLA breach issue in the original process.

4. **The answer violates the "exactly ONE" rule**: While it only modifies one element, the rationale implies a broader change than just that single attribute, which could be seen as an implicit suggestion of additional changes.

Overall, the answer shows some understanding of the BPMN structure but fails to properly address the SLA compliance issue and contains inaccuracies in both the technical implementation and the rationale.
