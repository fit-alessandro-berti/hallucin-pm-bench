**4.0**

The answer misses crucial points:

**Added Tasks**

• The answer does not complete missing changes.
- **Accurate** but is missing all but one name change
      - **Verify Identity** renamed   f/ **Task_VerifyIdentity**  to **Verify Identity**
      - **Reject Loan** renamed   f/ **Task_RejectLoan**  to **Final Reject**
      - **(note these changes should not be reported as added/repeated tasks rather task names changes)**

**Removed Task**
It appears the required inaccurately has the task with current ID **Task_FinalReject**
- **Incorrect** "Change in tasks' names: "Approve Loan" was renamed to "Auto-Approve Loan"
      - **Approve Loan** renamed   f/ **Task_ApproveLoan to **Auto-Approve Loan**

• The asnwer fails to explain the necessity to track potential name or structure changes and is not designed to thouroughly cross reference changes across  xml version path histories based shared id's in BPMN processes.

**Gateway-Type Changes**
- The answer  fails to specify actual concurrence changes
      - **Exclusive** could define logic along path **[Task_Decision Yes Directions]<**_**[yes Flow 3 + Task_Approve Loan + Flow 5]**_ **End Index **[AND/OR]**_**[no Flow 4 + Task_Reject Loan + Flow 6], but it does not explicably explain the Logic.**

      - **Inclusive** logically chains path outputs along this logic **[Task_Decision Yes Directions]<**_**[eligible Flow 4,  Task_Approve Loan,  Flow 7,  End]**_ **OR_**_**[missing docs  Flow 5,  Task_Request Docs,  Flow 8]**_**OR_** _**[ineligible Flow 6,  Task_Final Reject,  Flow 9], but it does not explicably explain the Logic**._`

      - Path is now non-cohesive, in xml v1 no ending endpoint exists beyond "yes Flow 3 + **Task_Approve Loan** +  Flow 5" OR "no Flow 4 + **Task_Reject Loan** + Flow 6"; however, that changes with path `[missing docs   Flow 5,  Task_Request Docs,  Flow 8]`.

• The asnwer fails to explain the differences, it simply states a changed structure and uses new hot paths [Flow 5 plus Flow 8]; without any further validation it vague yet undefined why "Task_VerifyIdentity" path starts first
      ![[ File format convention requires better definition: renaming ~ actual id format preferred. ]]
   _"**Verify Identity** renamed  f/ **Task_VerifyIdentity"=>** Verify Identity"._

This all implies a automated state transition discovery toolkit, with accurate cross referenced manual process alteration pathway state transition discovery documentation changes should be recommended.
