The answer correctly adheres to the strict vocabulary policy, using the required terms ("KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance") and avoiding the forbidden terms. The RACI matrix is accurately completed based on the provided process description. However, the matrix does not include the headings for "Accountable," "Consulted," and "Informed," which, while not applicable in this context, were explicitly mentioned in the user's request. Additionally, there is missing punctuation in the "Notify Customer" row. These small errors warrant a slight reduction in the score.
