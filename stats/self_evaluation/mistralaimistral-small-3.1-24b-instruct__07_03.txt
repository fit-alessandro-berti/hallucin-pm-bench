6.3

- Aspects in favor:
  - Clear and structured output with correct headings.
  - Correctly identifies added and removed tasks.
  - Correctly identifies the gateway type change for `Gateway_ReviewNeeded`.

- Aspects against:
  - Incorrectly reports the gateway type change for `Gateway_Payment`. In the provided XML snippets both versions have `exclusiveGateway`.
  - Minor grammatical error in the gateway type change description (should be `exclusiveGateway` instead of `exclusive`). It's not major but indicates lack of attention to detail.
  - Does not supply the required format of `id: old type → new type`. I.e. `Gateway_Payment ` should be replaced by `Gateway_Payment: exclusiveGateway → parallelGateway`.
