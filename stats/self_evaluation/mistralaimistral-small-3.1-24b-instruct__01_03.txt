5.0

**My evaluation:**
- The summary of the decision points is accurate but is missing DESCRIPTION headlines should be **Decision Point X**.
- The list of documents is accurate but should note that three documents are required for the TriColorRiskCheck.
- Formatting should be cleaner and more structured. Only Leave off names from "decision", which is redundant (e.g., "Tri-T réusss Decision", "TriVote Decision" can be simply "TriVote").
*** Comments:

        **a)** Summarise every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process, describing its rule in one sentence each.

1. **Decision Point 1**: If the risk rating is Low or Medium and the loan amount is ≤ €250,000, skip the Manual-Underwriting-Review.
2. **Decision Point 2**: The TriVote Decision Gate requires any two out of the three approvals (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer to pass.

        **b)** List **all** documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear.
