2.0

The LLM failed the core instruction regarding vocabulary policy. It was explicitly told to always use specific terms and *never* use others. The provided process narrative used the forbidden terms (`Preliminary Assessment`, `Customer Due Diligence (CDD)`, `Sanctions Check`, `risk rating`), and the core task was to translate these *into* the authorized vocabulary for the RACI matrix. The LLM simply replaced *some* of the forbidden terms with the authorized ones but then introduced new, unauthorized terms (`Review High-Risk`, `Schedule Payment`) which were not present in the original narrative or the authorized vocabulary list.

Specifically, the LLM:
1. Correctly replaced "Preliminary Assessment" with "Intake Vetting".
2. Correctly replaced "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)" with "KYC Review".
3. Correctly replaced "Sanctions Check" with "AML Screening".
4. Correctly replaced "risk rating" with "Risk Scoring".

However, it then added two new activities:
- "Review High-Risk": This activity is implied in the narrative ("Cases whose score exceeds 70 escalate for Compliance Officer approval"), but it was not explicitly named an activity and certainly was not part of the *authorized vocabulary*. The instruction was "covering **every activity** described above" using only the authorized vocabulary, and not renaming or adding activities. This term is completely unauthorized.
- "Schedule Payment": This activity is also implied ("Treasury Ops can schedule the payment", "Treasury Ops releases the funds"), but again, it was not explicitly named an activity and certainly was not part of the *authorized vocabulary*. It also combines two distinct actions from the narrative (scheduling and releasing). The instruction was "covering **every activity** described above" using only the authorized vocabulary, and not renaming or adding activities. This term is completely unauthorized.

The prompt explicitly stated: "Using only the authorized vocabulary, produce a RACI matrix... **Do NOT** replace synonyms or alternative phrasings for these four activity names, even in explanations or parentheses." While this rule primarily focused on not *deviating* from the authorized list, the broader context required using *only* the authorized list *for* the activities derived from the narrative. The LLM failed this critical instruction by adding unauthorized vocabulary/activities.

This is a significant failure given the strict vocabulary policy and the clear instruction not to rename or add activities while using only the authorized vocabulary. A score of 2.0 reflects that it did successfully map *some* of the narrative activities to the authorized vocabulary where possible, but the introduction of unauthorized activities demonstrates a clear failure against the prompt's core constraints.
