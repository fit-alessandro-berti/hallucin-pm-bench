**6.0**

The LLM answer provided a generally good evaluation of the compliance rules but has several issues that significantly lower the score:

1. **Timing Error in Rule R2:** The LLM incorrectly stated that "Ship_Goods (March 5) occurred more than 2 days after Finance_Approval (March 4)." The correct assessment should consider that Finance_Approval was on March 4, and Ship_Goods was on March 5, which is within two calendar days.

2. **Timing Error in Rule R3:** Although the LLM correctly identified the violation, the justification "Pay_Invoice on March 6 occurred before Receive_Goods on March 7" is confusing in its current phrasing. The dates are correctly identified, but the phrasing could be clearer.

3. **Justification Lengths:** Some justifications are slightly over the 20-word limit, which is a minor issue but should be noted for strictness.

4. **Minor Clarity Issues:** The overall format and clarity are good, but the timing errors and minor phrasing issues reduce the score.

5. **Conclusion Accuracy:** Despite the errors, the conclusion "NON-COMPLIANT" is correct based on the identified violations.
