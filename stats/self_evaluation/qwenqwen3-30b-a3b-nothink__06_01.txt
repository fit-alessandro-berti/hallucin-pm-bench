The LLM answer is incorrect and incomplete. The answer only lists one pair of tasks that can be executed in parallel (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), but it also includes an incorrect format with a slash (/no_think) that was not part of the original prompt. Additionally, the answer fails to identify the second pair of tasks that can be executed in parallel (Quality_Check — Create_Documentation), which is explicitly mentioned in the description. The answer also does not follow the instruction to output one pair per line, using the format "Task_X  —  Task_Y". The answer is not in alphabetical order within each pair, and it does not list all the pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel according to the description. The answer is also not in the correct format, as it does not use the specified format for the output. The answer is not correct and does not meet the requirements of the prompt.
