6.0.

Reasons for deduction:

1. **Accuracy of Sequence**: The sequence provided is correct. However, there was no mention of the parallel assignment to `pa` and `pb` and how those fire together. `T1` is listed before `T4`, implying `T1` is fired first, which is not necessarily true, as `pa` and `pb` are executed in a parallel fashion.
2. **Lack of Formal Explanation**: The answer does not provide a formal explanation for why the ordering is possible, which was part of the query.
3. **No mention of conflict**: The sequence given does not address the conflict in `pa` which actually has two transitions outside it(T2 and T2b).
4. **Minor Typos:** Small issues in formatting and presentation, such as inconsistent use of bold and italics, affect the overall quality of the response.
5. **Translating Shortest to more then Miniimal:** A minimal firing sequence would be T1 ->  T2b ->  T4 ->  T5, but making use of the parallelism in the system is desired. The answer just gives a shortest sequence. but giving one word "Shortest" does tie you to dangling the 'T1' in the firing sequence.

The provided explanation is correct but lacks depth and adherence to the instructions given in the prompt.
