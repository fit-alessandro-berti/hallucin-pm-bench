**Score: 4.5**

The LLM answer provided a RACI table that mostly adheres to the mandated vocabulary and covers the tasks described in the informal process description. However, there are several notable issues:

1. **Task 3**: The correct term for "Perform KYC Review" is used, but the roles are incorrectly labeled. The Transaction Analyst should be the one performing the KYC Review, and the Regulatory Liaison should be the one accountable for it.
2. **Task 4**: The term "Flag & Approve High-Risk Transaction" is not explicitly mentioned in the informal description, which could lead to confusion.
3. **Task 5**: The term "Release Payment & Send SWIFT Message" is not explicitly mentioned in the informal description, which could lead to confusion.
4. **Task 6**: The term "Archive Case File & Notify Compliance Officer" is not explicitly mentioned in the informal description, which could lead to confusion.

These issues result in a significant loss of points. The table is mostly correct in terms of the roles and tasks, but the vocabulary and clarity of the tasks need improvement.
