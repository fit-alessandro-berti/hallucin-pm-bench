**Reasoning:**

The LLM's response is excellent in many key ways:

*   **Accuracy:** It correctly identifies that the lack of time-related data (start/complete timestamps) in the event log prevents any computation.
*   **Conciseness:** The explanation is brief and to the point, fulfilling the prompt's requirement to be a "short paragraph."
*   **Precision:** It explicitly mentions the missing "start and complete timestamps" which is the precise reason preventing the calculation.
*   **Adherence to Constraints:** It correctly avoids guessing or using external knowledge.

The point deduction is because the response could have been slightly better: It would have been more complete if it stated *explicitly* that “Approve Invoice” cycle time is the difference between its "complete_time" minus its "start_time" - which obviously cannot be calculated.
