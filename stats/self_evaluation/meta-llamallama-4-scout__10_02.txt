The provided RACI table is generally well-structured and follows the mandated vocabulary. However, there are a few areas that need improvement:

1. **Task description consistency**: The task descriptions in the two provided tables are not consistent. The corrected table should have uniform task descriptions. 
2. **Notified party for task 7**: The original prompt states that "the compliance officer is notified" after archiving the case file. In the corrected table, it is correctly stated as "Regulatory Liaison" which is good. However, task 7 description was changed to "Archive case file and notify", it would be better to keep it as "Archive case file" for consistency and add notification in informed column description.

These are minor issues. Overall, the RACI table seems to accurately reflect the process described in the prompt, and the mandated vocabulary is used correctly. 

Here is how it could look like:
