**8.5**

**Rationale:**

1.  **Correct.** The activity "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" occurs exactly once.
2.  **Correct.** 1/18 = 0.05555... which rounds to 5.56%.
3.  **Correct.** Only A1002 contains the activity "Manual\_Fraud\_Check".
4.  **Correct.** Both reasons relating to sampling are valid and well-explained.

The response is almost flawless in that it adheres to all instructions and provides correct answers. The explanation in part 4 is concise and relevant.

There's a very slight reduction in the score because the formatting could be improved; the use of bolding is helpful, but other formatting options (e.g., slightly more space between question and answer) could improve readability a bit more. However, the content is excellent.
