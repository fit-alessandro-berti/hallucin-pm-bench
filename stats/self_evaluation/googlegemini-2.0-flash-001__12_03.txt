**9.5**

**Rationale:**
The answer is very good.
*   It correctly identifies that the FACT is incorrect.
*   The justification is clear and cites the correct CaseIDs (C002 and C004) to demonstrate the inaccuracy.
*   The inclusion of "For CaseID C001 and C003, Validate_Payment does occur immediately after Receive_Order" is actually beneficial, because it shows a deeper analysis of the log data and it acknowledges the cases where it does hold true (but clearly not always). This strengthens the overall argument.

Small deduction for writing style (could be slightly more concise). But there are no errors and the reasoning is sound.
