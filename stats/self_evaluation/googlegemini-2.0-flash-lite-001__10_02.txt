**7.0**

**Reasoning:**

The answer fulfills the prompt's core requirements, using the mandated vocabulary for roles and actions and constructing a RACI table. However, it has the following shortcomings:

*   **Minor Errors & Inconsistencies:**
    *   Task 5 is listed twice (both with number 5).
    *   The row for "**5. Ensure SWIFT message sent**" could have been more descriptive (e.g., "Ensure SWIFT Message Sent").
    *   The placement of "I" in the last row - the IT support should be only "I"
*   **Completeness and Nuance:**
    *   The "Consulted" and "Informed" columns are not well-populated. There could be more roles or actions classified.
    *   Missing an action for informing the Regulatory Liaison or the Transaction Analyst.
*   **Clarity in Presentation:** While the table is in Markdown, the structure could be improved to reflect the order in the source text.

The use of the correct vocabulary and the basic RACI table structure are the strengths. However, minor errors and a lack of thoroughness in the RACI assignment lead to deduction of points.
