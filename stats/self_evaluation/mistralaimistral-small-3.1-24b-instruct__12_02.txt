The response is correct and provides a clear justification by referencing the specific lines (6 and 7) and the case (C003) where the order of events contradicts the stated fact.
However, it loses a bit of strictness due the phrase "in most cases Validate_Payment follows Receive_Order" is not required.

Please, clarify, if you want me to evaluate only the worthiness of the answers based on the fact of wrong or right answer indefinite of style or wording, or if the style and wording are something that should influence the evaluation negatively.
