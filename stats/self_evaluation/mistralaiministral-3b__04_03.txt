**Score: 6.5**

**Evaluation:**

- The LLM correctly identifies the primary violations in the trace.
- It correctly references both Rule 1 and Rule 3 as the issues.
- However, it does not correctly identify the sequence of activities in Rule 1, which is the reason for the low score.
- The LLM should have mentioned that `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur before `Notify_Authorities` (NA), not after.
- The justification is clear but incomplete in terms of the correct sequence required by Rule 1.
