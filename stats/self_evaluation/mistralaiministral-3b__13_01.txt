**Score: 9.0**

The LLM answer is mostly correct and adheres to the strict instructions provided. However, there are a few minor inaccuracies and omissions that warrant a slight deduction:

1. **Calculation of Percentage**: The calculation of the percentage is correct, but the LLM could have mentioned that the percentage is rounded to two decimal places.
2. **Case Identifier(s)**: The case identifier(s) containing "Manual_Fraud_Check" is correctly listed as "A1002". However, it should be noted that the answer is case-sensitive, and the identifier should be listed in the exact format as given in the log fragment.
3. **Sampling-Related Reasons**: The reasons provided are accurate and relevant, but the LLM could have expanded on the second reason by mentioning that the log fragment does not provide any information about the frequency of events on other days or the distribution of events throughout the day.

Overall, the LLM provides a mostly accurate and relevant response, and the minor inaccuracies do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the answer.
