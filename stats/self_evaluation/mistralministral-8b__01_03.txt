**Score: 6.5**

The LLM's answer contains several inaccuracies and omissions:

1. **Missed Decision Point**: The LLM missed the conditional branch after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check step, which is crucial for understanding the process flow.
2. **Incorrect Risk Check Rule**: The LLM incorrectly stated the rule for the risk check. It should be "If the risk rating is Low or Medium **AND** the requested amount is less than or equal to €250,000, the process skips to the next step."
3. **Incorrect Document List**: The LLM incorrectly listed documents. For instance, "Deck Memo" should only appear if the risk rating is High or the requested amount is more than €250,000, but it was listed without this condition.
4. **Missing Document**: The LLM missed the "ID Matrix Declaration" document, which is required for the "Request-Applicant-Confirmation" step.

These errors significantly reduce the score, despite some accurate descriptions of the process steps.
