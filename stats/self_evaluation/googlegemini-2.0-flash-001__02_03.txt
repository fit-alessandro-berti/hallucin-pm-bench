**Rationale:**

*   **Question 1: Correct.** The log fragment contains three distinct cases: C123, C456, and C789.
*   **Question 2: Correct.** For case C456, "Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order".
*   **Question 3: Correct.** "Cancel_Order" appears only once in the provided log fragment.

The LLM correctly identifies all answers and provides them in the required bullet point format, and without any hallucinated text.
