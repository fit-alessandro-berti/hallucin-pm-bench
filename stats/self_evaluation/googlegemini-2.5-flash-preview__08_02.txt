The answer to Question 1 is correct. The explanation for Question 2 is generally correct in its reasoning, but it is excessively verbose and repetitive, significantly exceeding the word limit. The core argument about the consumption of the token in P2 by T3, which is also needed for T5, is sound and explains why T5 cannot fire after T3 has consumed the token in P2. However, the explanation circles back on the same points multiple times. Strictness dictates a penalty for the excessive length and repetition.
