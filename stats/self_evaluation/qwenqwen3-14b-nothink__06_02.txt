The LLM answer correctly identifies the three parallel blocks in Process B â€” Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware  

However, there is a small but notable error in the formatting of the third line. Instead of using commas to separate tasks, the LLM used a slash (`/`) as a separator. The user explicitly requested that tasks be "separated by commas," and this deviation, while minor, is a clear violation of the instructions.

Additionally, the answer does not explicitly label the parallel blocks as "Parallel Block P1," "Parallel Block P2," and "Parallel Block P3" as described in the original process, but this may not be strictly required since the user only asked to list the tasks, not label the blocks.

The answer is otherwise accurate and adheres to the requirement of only considering Process B and not mentioning tasks from other processes. However, the improper separator in line 3 results in a loss of points.
