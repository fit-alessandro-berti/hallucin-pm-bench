9.5

The LLM successfully extracted the activities and roles and correctly mapped their responsibilities in the RACI matrix. Crucially, it adhered strictly to the preferred terminology policy for the replacement terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance").

The only minor point of evaluation is that a true RACI matrix typically includes R (Responsible), A (Accountable), C (Consulted), and I (Informed) assignments. This matrix *only* shows the 'Responsible' party for each activity. However, given the input process description only explicitly assigned a single role to each step, and the prompt didn't elaborate on other RACI assignments, it's reasonable that the LLM only identified the "Responsible" role based on the provided information. The prompt requested *a* RACI matrix, not necessarily a *complete* one with all four roles defined for every activity.

Despite this, the strict adherence to the vocabulary policy and the accurate mapping of the *primary* responsibility makes this a very strong answer. The slight ambiguity regarding the completeness of the RACI roles is the only reason it doesn't receive a perfect score.
