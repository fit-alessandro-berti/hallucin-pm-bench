The LLM answer fails to adhere to the strict vocabulary policy provided in the prompt. It uses the forbidden term "Customer Due Diligence" instead of "KYC Review" and "Order Validation" instead of "Order Vetting". Additionally, it does not mention the roles for "Payment Clearance" and "Record Update" activities, which are crucial for a complete RACI matrix. The answer is incomplete and does not meet the requirements specified in the prompt.
