The LLM answer is mostly correct and adheres to the preferred terminology, which is critical for this prompt. However, there is a significant issue: the RACI matrix does not properly assign the "Accountable" (A) role. In a RACI matrix, every activity should have exactly one "Accountable" (A) role, and the LLM has omitted this entirely. Instead, it only uses "R" (Responsible) and "I" (Informed), which is incomplete and不符合 RACI standards. This is a major flaw that significantly impacts the correctness of the response.

Additionally, while the terminology is correct (using "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance"), the matrix is missing the "Accountable" designation for each activity, which is essential to a proper RACI matrix.

The structure is clear and the formatting is good, but the omission of the "Accountable" role is a critical error that justifies a deduction.
