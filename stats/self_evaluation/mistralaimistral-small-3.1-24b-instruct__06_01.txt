**3.0**

The LLM answer contains several significant errors:

1. **Incorrect Parallel Task Pairs**: The pairs listed include tasks that cannot be executed in parallel according to the description of Process B. For example, `Fabricate` cannot run in parallel with `Procure_Materials` or `Schedule_Machines` because `Fabricate` starts only after both `Procure_Materials` and `Schedule_Machines` are complete.

2. **Missing Correct Parallel Task Pairs**: The correct pairs that should be listed are:
   - `Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check`
   - `Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`

3. **Format and Order**: The format and order are correct, but the content is entirely wrong, which is a critical failure for the task.

Given the strict evaluation criteria, these errors result in a very low score.
