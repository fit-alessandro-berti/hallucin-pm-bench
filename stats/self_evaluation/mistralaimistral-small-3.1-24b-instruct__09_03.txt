4.5
The answer is correct, but it is not formulated professionally in accordance with the instructions: Plain text without any tables requested and also I requested to respond in Plain text style. It is impossible to compute metrics for any timestamps since these are not provided at all. Reasoning given is very much in line with that but even if answer is correct, incorrect structure of the response deducts quite significant reduce of the points. Also missing each metric rating standard. Given that there could have been no absolute correct answer, this deduction of the points is in line, I believe.
Furthermore this prompt is of no conventional answer and this is considering Navigating Non-Standard Contexts, so there are no further deduction of or any such reason which is also missing from LLM response.
