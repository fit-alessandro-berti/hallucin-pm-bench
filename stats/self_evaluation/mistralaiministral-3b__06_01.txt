**Score: 8.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies two pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel according to the description of Process B. However, there is a small error in the format of the output. The correct format should be:

```
Task_X  â€”  Task_Y
```

Instead, the LLM answer uses a single dash (`-`) between the tasks. This minor formatting error results in a slight deduction from the maximum score.
