**Reasoning:**

*   **Q1: Correct (10/10).** The LLM correctly identifies the three distinct cases.
*   **Q2: Correct (10/10).** The LLM accurately lists the sequence of activities for case "C002" in the correct order.
*   **Q3: Mostly Correct (7/10).** The LLM identifies the correct activities but misses one.  While Arrange\_Delivery and Check\_Stock are correct, it misses Receive\_Order which immediately precedes Ship\_Order in case C001.  The lack of the Receive\_Order activity represents a significant error as the question focuses on precision.
