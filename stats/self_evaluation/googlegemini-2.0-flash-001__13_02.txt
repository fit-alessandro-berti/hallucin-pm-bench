4.0

**Rationale:**

*   **Q1: Correct Answer (1/1).** The LLM correctly identifies that "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" occurs only once.

*   **Q2: Correct Answer (2/2).** The LLM correctly calculates the percentages for both events (2.08%) and cases (8.33%), and correctly rounds to two decimals.

*   **Q3: Potentially Misleading and Slightly Redundant (1/4).** The answer *partially addresses* the prompt but exhibits redundancy.

    *   The first two sentences are sufficient to answer the question. The final sentence does not add additional insight.
    *   The phrase "skew analyses if generalised" is vague and does not explain the different ways in which analyses can be skewed. For example, the LLM could have indicated that:
        *   low-support activities can have a significant impact that is missed by standard analyses
        *   the specific timing of the low-support activity may not be well-captured, since there is only one example of it

**Overall Score:**

The LLM achieves a score of 4.0 due to the partially correct answer to Q3, which needed more nuance.
