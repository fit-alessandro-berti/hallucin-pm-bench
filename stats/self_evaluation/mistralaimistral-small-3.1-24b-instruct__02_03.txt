**Score: 4.0**

- **Incorrect timestamp comparison**: The LLM incorrectly interprets the timestamps.
- **Question (1) is correct.**
- **Question (2) is incorrect**: The LLM incorrectly  based the answer on incorrect timestamp interpretation.
- **Question (3) is correct**.

- There are 3 distinct cases present (C123, C456, C789).
- Cannot be determined, the timestamps put the event "Pack_Items" in 9:40 and "Ship_Order" is put in 9:35. Thus from this data the order cannot be determined. The correct outcome is the question not being answerable based on this data.
- The activity **“Cancel_Order”** appears exactly once in the entire fragment.

The main reason for the low score is that the LLM didn't correctly interpret the timestamp data and as a result the answer for question 2 is wrong, as well as the LLM doesn't tell the user that it's not answerable based on the data, while it should.
