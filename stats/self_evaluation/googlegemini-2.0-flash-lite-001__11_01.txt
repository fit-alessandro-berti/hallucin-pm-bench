**Reasoning:**

*   **Strengths:** The memo format is correct and professional. It identifies the correct three worst-performing activities based on waiting time and ranks them correctly. It includes both average and 95th percentile waiting times for each activity. The recommendations are relevant and concrete. It stays within the word limit.
*   **Weaknesses:** The action recommendations, while plausible, do not explicitly state how the proposed actions will reduce the waiting time by at least 20%. This is a key requirement of the prompt. The actions are generic.
