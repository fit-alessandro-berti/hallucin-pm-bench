6.5

Changes that lead me to this decision:
* The phrasing "the process ends" instead of being clear that “Final process step” which does not precisely match the prompt. Instead it was necessary to mention that if is Ineligible/Not approved that any required notifications to the passenger must be issued
  for this reason I should decrease the score 2.0
* Initial documentation was thereby missing a final document
  for this reason I subtract 1.0

It contains vague statements, repeatedly presents the decision conditions incorrectly, and does not specify final notification steps where there is non-eligibility or non-approval.

The description could be rewritten, to specify that if any step described fails, the passenger must be provided relevant refund-response documentation and not the RefundConfirmationPDF

Nevertheless at least provides the expected result and is relevant and without really spelling mistakes; relevant missing and due minor mistakes allowed me to add 0.5 to make up a 6.5.
