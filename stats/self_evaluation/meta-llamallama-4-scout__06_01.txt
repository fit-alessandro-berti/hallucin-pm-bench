The LLM answer correctly identifies the pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel. The answer lists the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in the overall list, as required. The format of the output is also correct.

However, I deducted points because the LLM answer includes a somewhat casual note at the end ("Let me know if I got it right!") that is not necessary and detracts from the professionalism of the response. Additionally, while the answer is accurate, it could be more rigorous in its wording, e.g., by explicitly stating that it has been verified that no other pairs of tasks can be executed in parallel beyond those listed. Nevertheless, given the instructions and the context, the answer is largely correct.
