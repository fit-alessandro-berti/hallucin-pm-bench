**Reasoning:**

*   **Q1:** Correct (1.0/1.0)
*   **Q2:** Correct (1.0/1.0)
*   **Q3:** Correct (1.0/1.0)
*   **Q4:** The core of the answer is correct and the reasoning is adequate. (4.5/5.0)  The response correctly notes the single-day time span as a key issue. The small sample size is also a good reason. However, the answer is somewhat generic. While technically correct, it could have been more insightful. For example, it could have pointed out that the period might not be representative of a full month if, say, the fraud checks happen more frequently at the end of a month (due to a certain kind of billing cycle).

**Overall:** The answer is mostly correct and well-structured. The provided reasons in Q4 could have been more insightful.
