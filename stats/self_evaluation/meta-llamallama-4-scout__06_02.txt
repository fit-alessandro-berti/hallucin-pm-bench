The LLM answer accurately identifies the parallel blocks in Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing. 

The answer correctly lists the tasks in each parallel block separated by commas, as requested:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

However, I deduct 2 points for not explicitly stating that these are the only parallel blocks mentioned in the process description, which could potentially lead to an incomplete answer if the reader is not careful. Nevertheless, given the context, the answer is clear and correct. 

To achieve a perfect score, the answer could be slightly improved by adding a phrase to confirm that these blocks are exhaustive, e.g., "These are all the parallel blocks mentioned in Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing." 

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the prompt and accurately conveys the required information.
