2.5

**Explanation** for such a low grade:

- The basic claim was correct - in the data, "Authorize_Refund" does not occur immediatly before "Update_Inventory". **However**, the fact checker made three types of mistakes:

  1. Always refuses to speculate (this was requested, noble, correct)
  2. **"Does not appear" is not "occur immediatly before"**. This is quite incorrect.
  3. **The casing is wrong on the words "Receive_Return," "Inspect_Item."** This is clearly wrong.
