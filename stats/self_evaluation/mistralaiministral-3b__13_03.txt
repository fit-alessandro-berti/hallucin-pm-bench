8.0

The LLM answer is mostly correct, but the response to the second question is not entirely accurate. The LLM states that the excerpt does not provide information on the total number of applications processed, which is true, but it also does not mention the proportion of applications that undergo manual fraud checks. The LLM should have mentioned that the excerpt does not provide information on the proportion of applications that undergo manual fraud checks. Therefore, the score is 8.0.
