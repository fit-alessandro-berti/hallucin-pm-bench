8.5

The LLM successfully identified the core decision points and listed all required documents from the provided text. It adhered to the negative constraints of not introducing standard loan terminology and using the exact activity names. The formatting is clear and easy to follow.

Minor points for improvement that prevent a perfect score:

*   While "Decision Points" is a slightly more natural way to phrase it, the prompt asked for a summary of the "decision points *in* Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track process". Simply listing the names of the gates/steps where decisions happen is accurate and fulfills the request.
*   The framing sentence "Here are the decision points and required documents for Acme Bank's Micro-loan Fast-Track process:" is slightly conversational. A more direct answer would simply present the information.

These are very minor issues, reflecting strict enforcement of evaluation criteria. The core task of summarizing the decision points and listing the documents is performed accurately and adheres to all explicit constraints.
