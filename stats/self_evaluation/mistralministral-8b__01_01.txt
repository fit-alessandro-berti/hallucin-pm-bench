**Score: 7.0**

The LLM answer provides a good summary of the decision points and required documents in Contoso Airlines' flight-refund process. However, there are a few errors and omissions:

1. The LLM does not mention the constraint that the "Process_Refund_Payment" may begin only after "Finance_Controller_PreApprove" has succeeded **and**, for high-value claims, "Senior_Auditor_Review" has been completed. This is a significant oversight and should have been included.

2. The LLM incorrectly lists "Senior_Auditor_Review" as a decision point. It should be listed as a required document for high-value claims, but not as a decision point.

3. The LLM does not mention the required document "BankTransferAuthorization" for the "Process_Refund_Payment" decision point. This is a minor error, but it should have been included.

Overall, the LLM answer is mostly accurate, but it contains enough errors to warrant a score of 7.0 instead of 10.0.
