**4.5**

Here is the detailed evaluation:

1. **Q1**: Correct. There are indeed 3 distinct case IDs: "A-9321", "B-1045", and "C-77".

2. **Q2**: Correct. The activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case "A-9321" is "Pack_Items".

3. **Q3**: Correct. The earliest timestamp in the fragment is "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00".

4. **Q4**: Correct. The activity "Quality_Check" occurs 2 times.

5. **Q5**: Incorrect. The activities that never appear as the first event of any case are "Pack_Items", "Quality_Check", and "Ship_Order". "Validate_Order" does appear as the first event in case "A-9321". This error significantly reduces the score.

The model failed to correctly identify that "Validate_Order" can be the first event, which is a critical error for a meticulous process-mining analyst. Therefore, the score is reduced to 4.5 out of 10.
