8.0

**Rationale:**

The model has done a fairly good job and has tried to follow instructions.

**Here's a breakdown:**

*   **Adherence to Format (2/2):** The response uses the specified headings, which is correct.
*   **Accuracy of Task Identification (5/5):** It identifies all added, removed, and modified elements.
*   **Completeness (1/2):** Misses that `ApproveLoan` task has been renamed to `Auto-Approve Loan`. This is NOT cosmetic (as per prompt). It's a task change.

**Penalties Applied:**

*   Completeness: -2.0 points because the model missed the renaming of task "ApproveLoan" to "Auto-Approve Loan".
