The answer suggests adding a new intermediate event (a timer catch event), which is not allowed since the user explicitly stated no new activities can be added. This violates the constraint. Additionally, the suggested solution would require a new sequence flow and potentially a new event, which are not permitted. The answer fails to address how to ensure the SLA without introducing new elements, and it incorrectly assumes that a new event can be added without violating the constraints.
