The answer is correct ("No"). The justification is partially correct, referencing case C003. However, the justification inaccurately states that Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order (it should be vice-versa). The justification should also cite lines (6,7), to be fully consistent with the requirements of the prompt.
