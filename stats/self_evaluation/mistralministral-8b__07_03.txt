1.0

The provided LLM answer is incorrect and does not meet the requirements specified in the prompt. Here are the specific issues:

1. **ADDED TASKS**: The LLM correctly identified the added tasks, but the format is not strictly followed. It should be `id` followed by `name` in parentheses, e.g., `Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)`.

2. **REMOVED TASKS**: The LLM correctly identified the removed task, but the format is not strictly followed. It should be `id` followed by `name` in parentheses, e.g., `Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)`.

3. **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: The LLM correctly identified the gateway type change but did not follow the required format. It should be `id` followed by the change as `old type → new type`, e.g., `Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel`.

The LLM failed to adhere to the strict format and the requirement to list only verifiable differences without any commentary or guesses. Therefore, the score is 1.0.
