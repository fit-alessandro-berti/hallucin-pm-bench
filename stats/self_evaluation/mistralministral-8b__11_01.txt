**Score: 8.5**

**Evaluation:**

1. **Accuracy of Data**: The LLM correctly identified the three worst-performing activities by waiting time, accurately ranked them, and quoted both the average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each.

2. **Concreteness of Actions**: The LLM provided concrete data-driven actions for each activity. However, the percentage reductions in waiting time are not exactly 20% as requested, but they are close.

3. **Adherence to Prompt**: The memo adheres to the word count limit and does not discuss any activity not listed in the table.

4. **Clarity and Conciseness**: The memo is clear and concise, making it suitable for an executive audience.

**Deductions:**

- The memo does not strictly adhere to the 20% reduction in waiting time for each action, which is a significant deduction.
- The memo could benefit from more precise language and formatting, such as using bullet points for clarity.

Overall, the LLM provided a well-structured and informative memo, but the strict adherence to the 20% reduction requirement and minor formatting issues slightly reduce the score.
