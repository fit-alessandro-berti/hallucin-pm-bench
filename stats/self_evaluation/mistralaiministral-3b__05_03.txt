**Score: 3.0**

The LLM's answer fails to address the requirement of enforcing the SLA without adding any new activities. The solution provided includes new condition expressions that redirect to existing activities, which is not compliant with the task's constraints. The justification provided is also incorrect as it does not explain why the SLA is being enforced through these condition expressions. The answer does not meet the requirement and thus deserves a low score.
