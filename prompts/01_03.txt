System: You are an expert on **Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process**, defined *exactly* as follows.
(The steps below purposely diverge from the textbook “credit-analysis → underwriting → approval committee” model.)

PROCESS DESCRIPTION  
1  Receive-Application          Document: **Form 14B**  
2  Assign-Deck-Reviewer (role: **Deck Officer**)  
3  Tri-Color-Risk-Check  
  • Inputs: **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow**  
  • Outcome = {Low, Medium, High} risk rating  
4  ⇢ *If* (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} **AND** requested-amount ≤ €250 000)  
   skip step 5  
5  Manual-Underwriting-Review    Document: **Deck Memo**  
6  Decision-Gate **“TriVote”** — requires approvals from all three:  
   ▪ Credit Lead ▪ Regulatory Liaison ▪ Sustainability Officer  
   Decision rule: *any two approvals out of three suffice to pass*  
7  Prepare-Binding-Offer      Document: **Offer Sheet 77**  
8  Request-Applicant-Confirmation  Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, **ID Matrix Declaration**  
9  Finalize-Agreement       Document: **Loan Dossier 2025**

*Note:*  
− **KYC/AML checks are **not** performed here; they are outsourced to a third-party vendor and therefore absent from this in-house process.**  
− “Sustainability Officer” participation is mandatory in every loan cycle, even for micro-loans.  
− No credit-bureau pull occurs outside the Tri-Color-Risk-Check described above.

User:  
**a)** Summarise every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process, describing its rule in one sentence each.  
**b)** List **all** documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear.
