You are a senior process-audit bot.  Your task is to decide whether the following
purchase-to-pay trace respects the official rule set **P2P-2025.R1**.

Process rule set
1. Any purchase order (PO) whose total amount exceeds €10 000 must obtain **two** approvals,
   first by a *Procurement Officer* and then by the *CFO*, **before** activity `Issue_PO`.
2. If the trace contains activity `Expedite_Flag`,  
   • activity `Quality_Check` becomes optional **but**  
   • activity `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`.
3. After `Goods_Received`, activity `Three_way_match` must be completed **within the next two
   activities** (distance ≤ 2).
4. No activity executed by the role **Intern** may **directly follow** an activity executed by
   the role **CFO**.
5. The trace must finish with `Archive_Record` and contain nothing after it.

Case attributes  
• `PO_Amount` = €12 300      (above the €10 000 threshold)
