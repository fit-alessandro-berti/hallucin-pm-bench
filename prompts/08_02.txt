Consider the Petri net PN-8 below (initial marking M0 = { P0 }).

Places (tokens in brackets):
  P0 (1) P1 (0) P2 (0) P3 (0) P4 (0) P5 (0) P6 (0)

Transitions  (•t → t•):
  T1: { P0 }           → { P1, P2 }          // AND-split
  T2: { P1 }           → { P3 }
  T7: { P3 }           → { P4 }
  T3: { P2 }           → { P4 }
  T4: { P4 }           → { P5 }
  T5: { P2, P5 }       → { P6 }              // synchronising join

**Question 1.**  In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition **T5** to fire **before** transition **T3**?  

**Question 2 (bonus).**  If your answer is *yes*, give one minimal firing sequence (as an ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it; if *no*, explain why no such sequence exists.
