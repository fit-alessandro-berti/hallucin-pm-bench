**Context**  
Below is the Q1-2025 performance dashboard for the *Claims Handling* process.  
Column definitions  
- `avg_throughput`   = cases completed per day  
- `avg_wait_time_min` = average queueing time before the activity starts (minutes)  
- `avg_processing_time_min` = average execution time of the activity itself (minutes)  
- `stdev_processing_time_min` = variability (minutes)  
- `rework_rate_pct` = % of cases that repeat the activity at least once  
- `sla_breach_pct` = % of cases whose processing time exceeded the SLA

```

**Task**  
Draft a concise executive memo (**≤ 200 words**) that  

1. **Identifies the three worst-performing activities**,  
2. Explains *why* each under-performs based strictly on the table, and  
3. Recommends **one concrete, data-driven action** for each.   

Do **not** mention any activity that is absent from the table.  
If the numbers do not clearly differentiate between candidates, say so rather than guessing.
