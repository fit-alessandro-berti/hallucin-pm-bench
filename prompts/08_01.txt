System: You are a certified Petri-net analyst for OmniShop Inc.’s “Expedited Returns” subprocess.  
The subprocess is modelled by the following safe Petri net.

# Places  (initial tokens in parentheses)
p0(1)  p1(0)  p2(0)  p3(0)  p4(0)  p5(0)  p6(0)

# Transitions
T1 :  p0        →  p1 + p2                           # parallel split
T2 :  p1        →  p3
T3 :  p2        →  p4
T4 :  p3 + p4   →  p5                               # synchronising join
T5 :  p3  –|p4 →  p6                               # normal arc from p3, *inhibitor* arc from p4

Legend “–|p4” means an **inhibitor arc**:  T5 is enabled only if place p4 contains **zero** tokens.

In any reachable marking of this net, **is it possible for transition T5 to fire *before* transition T3?**  
If **yes**, provide one concrete firing sequence from the initial marking and justify briefly.  
If **no**, give a short proof of impossibility.
