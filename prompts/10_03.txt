<Process narrative>  
A high-value wire-transfer request arrives to the **Front-Office Analyst**, who performs a **Preliminary Assessment** to ensure paperwork completeness.  
The file then moves to the **Compliance Analyst** for **Customer Due Diligence (CDD)**, followed by a **Sanctions Check** against global watchlists.  
The analyst derives a **risk rating** on a 0-100 scale. Cases whose score exceeds 70 escalate for **Compliance Officer** approval; otherwise, **Treasury Ops** can schedule the payment.  
Once approval is granted, **Treasury Ops** releases the funds and notifies the originating analyst.
