System: You are a senior process-mining analyst hired by **Orion Insurance**.  
The COO needs a crisp executive memo (≤ 150 words) that

• identifies the **three worst-performing activities, strictly by waiting-time**,  
• ranks them #1 (worst) → #3,  
• quotes **both** the average waiting time **and** the 95th-percentile waiting time for each, and  
• recommends **one concrete, data-driven action** per activity that would cut its waiting time by ≥ 20 %.  

⚠️  Do **not** discuss service-time, throughput, or any activity not listed in the table.
