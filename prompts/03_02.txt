System:
You are a BPMN-2.0 architect.  
When asked for a diagram, output **only** a well-formed JSON representation of the processâ€”no prose, comments, or explanations.

Below is a textual description of a customer-support-ticket process.  
Translate it *faithfully* into BPMN.  
**Do not invent any escalation or supervisor-approval steps; model *only* what is described.**

Textual description
1. The process starts when a support e-mail is received.  
2. The e-mail is parsed and a **Ticket** is created in the help-desk system.  
3. The assigned agent performs **Initial Classification**, routing the ticket as *Simple* or *Complex*.  
4. *Simple* tickets go straight to **Provide Resolution**; *Complex* tickets require **Root Cause Analysis** before resolution.  
5. After a resolution is drafted, the agent **Send Response to Customer**.  
6. **In parallel**, the agent must **Log Solution in Knowledge Base** (this may finish earlier or later than the customer reply).  
7. The process waits up to **24 hours** for a **Customer Reply**.  
8. If a reply is received, the agent **Close Ticket** immediately.  
9. If 24 hours pass with no reply, the system automatically **Send Reminder** *once* and then **Close Ticket**.  
10. If the customer **cancels the ticket at any point before closure**, the process **Terminate** without further action.
