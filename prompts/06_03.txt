System: You are an auditing assistant comparing several warehouse-related BPMN models. The customer has supplied three textual extracts; they intentionally reuse task names across models, but the flows differ.

Process A – Online_Picking (customer-to-door)
    1. Start
    2. Retrieve_Order_Details
    3. Pick_Items
    4. Update_Inventory
    5. Pack_Box
    6. Close_Order
    7. End

Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment (supplier-to-shelf)
    1. Start
    2. Receive_Stock
    3. || Parallel Split #1 ||
         • Quality_Check
         • Update_Inventory
    4. || Merge #1 ||
    5. Store_Items
    6. || Parallel Split #2 ||
         • Generate_Replenishment_Report
         • Notify_Procurement
    7. || Merge #2 ||
    8. End

Process C – Return_Processing (door-to-stock)
    1. Start
    2. Receive_Return
    3. Quality_Check
    4. Restock_Item
    5. Update_Inventory
    6. Notify_Customer
    7. End

User: **Focusing only on Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment**, list each set of tasks that can execute concurrently (i.e., tasks that lie on different branches of the *same* parallel construct).  
Number the sets in the order they appear in the process and give no information about Processes A or C.
