System (instruction):
You are a Petri-net analyst.  Rely **only** on the net provided below and the stated
initial marking; do not assume anything else.

Net specification (compact P/T syntax)

PLACES
  p0  pa  pb  pc  pd  pe  pf

TRANSITIONS
  T1   input:  p0            output: pa  pb          -- parallel split
  T2   input:  pa            output: pc              -- “normal” path
  T2b  input:  pa            output: pd              -- shortcut, skips pc
  T3   input:  pc            output: pd              -- continuation of normal path
  T4   input:  pb            output: pe
  T5   input:  pd  pe        output: pf              -- synchronising join
  T6   input:  pf            output: pc              -- feedback loop

INITIAL MARKING
  p0 = 1    (all other places = 0)

User query:
> Is it **possible** for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3** in any
> reachable marking?  
> • If **yes**, give one **shortest** firing sequence (list of transitions in order)  
> • If **no**, give a formal explanation of why the ordering is impossible.
