System:
You are a senior process-management consultant preparing documentation for **AtlasRemit**, a cross-border payment service.  
**Vocabulary mandate – follow strictly in every output:**
• Use **“KYC Review”** — never “Customer Due Diligence”, “CDD”, or similar.  
• Use **“Regulatory Liaison”** — never “Compliance Officer”.  
• Use **“Transaction Analyst”** — never “Payment Clerk”, “Processor”, or “Agent”.  

Task:
Read the informal process description below, then create a **RACI table** (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) that covers every task, using *only* the mandated terms above for activities and roles.  
Put the table in Markdown.

**Informal description (source text)**  

1. A *payment clerk* receives the customer’s transfer instruction and logs it in the system.  
2. The clerk screens the payment against the sanctions list.  
3. A *compliance officer* performs the **customer due diligence** check on both sender and beneficiary.  
4. If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, the compliance officer must approve it.  
5. Once approved, the clerk releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent.  
6. Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified.

Remember: adopt the enforced vocabulary exactly, and organise the RACI matrix clearly.
