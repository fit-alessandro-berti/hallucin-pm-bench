You are an expert BPMN modeller.

Below is a plain-language description (10 numbered lines) of **AcmeTech’s support-ticket process**.  
Translate it into **BPMN 2.0 XML** exactly as stated.  
**Do not invent or add** escalations, SLA timers, events, activities, or gateways that are *not* mentioned.

Textual description  
1. The process starts when a customer submits a support ticket.  
2. The ticket is automatically classified by the system.  
3. If the ticket is classified as **“Password Reset”**, it goes straight to **“Provide Reset Instructions”**.  
4. Otherwise, a support agent performs **“Initial Diagnosis”**.  
5. After diagnosis, the agent either **“Resolve Issue”** or **“Forward to Specialist”**.  
6. When the specialist finishes, the ticket is **“Resolve Issue”**.  
7. Once resolved, the ticket is **“Confirm with Customer”**.  
8. If the customer confirms resolution, the ticket is closed.  
9. If the customer reports the issue persists, it loops back to **“Initial Diagnosis”**.  
10. The process ends when the ticket is closed.

✦ Use concise IDs (e.g., `t1`, `gw1`).  
✦ Mark the two decision points with **exclusive gateways**.  
✦ Model the re-work loop exactly as line 9 describes.  
✦ No diagram/interchange elements are required.
