Process description – *Warranty-Replacement v1.3* (last updated 2025-03-01)  
1. The process starts when a customer submits an **online warranty claim**.  
2. A service agent **validates the claim**. If the claim is incomplete, the agent **requests missing
   information** and waits until it is received before re-validating.  
3. After validation, the agent **checks warranty eligibility**.  
   – If the product is **within warranty**, proceed.  
   – If the product is **out of warranty**, **send rejection notice** and **end** the process.  
4. For eligible claims, two activities occur **in parallel**:  
   a. **Create shipment order** for the replacement unit.  
   b. **Schedule courier pickup** of the faulty product.  
5. Once both parallel activities finish, **update inventory records**, then **close the claim** and **end** the
   process.

Output: Return a single self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document.  
• Use a start event, an exclusive gateway for step 2 completeness, another exclusive gateway for step 3 warranty
  decision, and a parallel-split / parallel-join gateway pair for step 4.  
• Provide exactly **two** end events (one for rejection, one for successful completion).  
• Prefix every element’s **id** with “wrc_”.  
• Task names must match the text **verbatim**.
