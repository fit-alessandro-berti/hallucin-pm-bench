The LLM answer is factually perfect: correctly answers "No", accurately identifies the two counterexamples (C002 and C004) with precise intervening activities ("Pack_Items" and "Check_Fraud"), notes the compliant cases (C001, C003), and correctly applies the "always" universal quantifier. It strictly relies on the log evidence.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic/presentation differences from ground truth:
- Prose/bullets vs. exhaustive case-by-case table format.
- Includes irrelevant but correct post-Validate_Payment activity (Pack_Items) in C004 sequence.
No content errors, omissions, or inaccuracies warrant larger penalties under strict evaluation.
