4.0

The LLM answer shows a reasonable attempt but significant issues lead to major point deductions:

**Errors and Omissions:**

1. **Missing "Operations Manager" role:**  
   The ground truth includes an "Operations Manager" listed as "Accountable" on every task. The LLM answer omits this role entirely, which is a substantial departure from the ground truth.

2. **Incorrect/incomplete use of RACI assignments:**  
   The LLM answer often combines "Responsible" and "Accountable" for the same person (e.g., Transaction Analyst is both R & A for several tasks), which is contrary to the ground truth, where "Accountable" is always "Operations Manager".  
   Additionally, "Consulted" and "Informed" fields are often left blank or marked as N/A, whereas the ground truth always thoughtfully assigns these.

3. **Task naming deviations:**  
   Several LLM task descriptions (e.g., "Log transfer instruction in system", "Ensure SWIFT message is sent", "Archive case file") do not exactly match the enforced terminology or mappings in the ground truth answer. Precise wording from the ground truth (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "Archive Record") is not used.

4. **Inclusion of technical-implementation activities:**  
   Tasks like "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" are unnecessarily includedâ€”even though the ground truth merges this procedural aspect into broader activities.

5. **Legend omission:**  
   There's no accompanying legend for R, A, C, I.

**Partial Credit:**

- The LLM did correctly replace role names with mandated terms (e.g., "Transaction Analyst" and "Regulatory Liaison").
- Attempts were made to respect the new vocabulary and to map activities, albeit imprecisely.

**Grading Rationale:**  
These issues, especially the omitted "Accountable" party (Operations Manager), improper RACI splits, divergence from precise process/task wording, and blanked RACI fields, warrant a strict deduction. Only a minority of tasks roughly line up with the ground truth, but fundamental mapping errors and process documentation mismatches make a score higher than 4.0 unjustified.
