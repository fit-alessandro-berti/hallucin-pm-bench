### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates basic adherence to the prompt's vocabulary mandate (correctly using "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst" without substitutions like "CDD" or "Compliance Officer"). It produces a Markdown RACI table covering most tasks from the informal description without omissions in content mapping. However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions apply for the following differences from the ground truth:

- **Structure and Format (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: The ground truth uses a standard RACI format with fixed roles as column headers (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) and R/A/C/I indicators placed under each role per task, with bolding for R/A and a clear legend. The LLM uses a non-standard per-task column format (Responsible, Accountable, etc., with roles listed within cells), no bolding, no legend, and excessive use of "N/A" instead of proper assignments or blanks. This alters clarity and fidelity to a conventional RACI matrix.

- **Roles and Assignments (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: The ground truth incorporates an "Operations Manager" role for accountability across tasks, which the LLM omits entirely, leading to incomplete role coverage (e.g., no equivalent for OM's A in most rows). RACI assignments differ substantially in nearly every row:
  - Receive/Log: LLM assigns TA as R&A (with RL as C); ground truth has TA as R, OM as A, RL as I, IT as C.
  - Screen: LLM TA as R&A (RL as C); ground truth TA as R, RL as A, OM as I, IT as C.
  - KYC Review: Partial overlap (RL as R, TA as C), but LLM adds RL as A and omits OM A/IT I.
  - Approve: Similar partial overlap but mismatches on A and missing roles.
  - Release: LLM TA as R&A (RL as C); ground truth TA as R, OM as A, RL as I, IT as C.
  - Archive: LLM IT as R&A (RL as I); ground truth IT as R, OM as A, TA as C, RL as I.
  These mismatches fundamentally alter the responsibility matrix, which is the core purpose of the task.

- **Task Coverage and Wording (moderate deduction: -1.0 points)**: The LLM covers all informal steps but introduces an extra row ("Ensure SWIFT message is sent"), which the ground truth absorbs into "Release Payment" without separation, creating an unwarranted expansion. Task phrasings have small but notable differences (e.g., LLM's "Log transfer instruction in system" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review for sender and beneficiary" adds unmandated details vs. concise "**KYC Review**"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"). The informal step 1 (receive *and* log) is split in LLM but combined in ground truth, showing imprecise mapping. No omissions, but the extras and wording variations count as errors.

Overall, while the LLM is functional and prompt-compliant in vocabulary and Markdown output, the cumulative differences—especially in structure, role inclusion, and assignments—result in a low score. A perfect match would require identical format, roles, and distributions; even minor deviations like wording or N/A usage warrant substantial penalties per the strictness guideline.
