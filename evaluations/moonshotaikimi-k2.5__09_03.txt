The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in all key aspects: it precisely identifies the impossibility due to redacted rows and timestamps in Artefact A, explicitly lists all required metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, confidence interval), explains the need for start_time/complete_time data for "Approve Invoice" durations, remains in one short plain-text paragraph without guesses or external knowledge, and ignores irrelevant artefacts/details. Minor stylistic variations (e.g., "temporal records" vs. "concrete times"; explicit metric listing vs. "dispersion"; privacy mention from artefact text) are not errors and do not warrant deduction under strict evaluation, as substance, precision, and adherence match perfectly.
