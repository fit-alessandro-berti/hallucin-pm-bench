8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant and accurately cites the two key violating rules (2 and 3) with precise event references, matching the ground truth on those points. However, under utmost strictness:
- **Major deduction (-1.0)**: Fails to provide a complete check of *all* 5 rules (only lists violations, omitting explicit confirmation that Rules 1, 4, and 5 are satisfied, unlike the exhaustive numbered structure in ground truth).
- **Minor deduction (-0.5)**: Imprecise distance phrasing for Rule 3 ("four steps later" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"), introducing a small counting inconsistency despite recognizing the violation.

Total deductions reflect significant gaps in completeness and exact alignment.
