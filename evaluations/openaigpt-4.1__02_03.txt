9.5

- The LLM answer is nearly perfect—answers to all three questions are correct in content and format (concise, bullet-points).
- The only small deviation is in slightly differing punctuation/formatting compared to the ground truth (e.g., writing "There are 3 distinct cases: ..." instead of "3 cases (C123,...)").
- The list bulleting (“-”) is used instead of (“*”), and it uses bold for some answers. But these are minor stylistic differences and the meaning and conciseness are fully preserved.
- No errors in reasoning or data extraction are present.

**Deduction:** -0.5 for not matching the exact expected format (ordering, parentheses, bullets, minor elaboration).
