4.0

- The LLM answer gives the correct overall verdict: **Non-compliant**.
- Rule 2 assessment is correct, identifying the required sequence violation (`Risk_Assessment` occurs after `Ship_Goods`).
- Rule 3 assessment is **incorrect**: the answer claims compliance, but, per ground truth, `Three_way_match` occurs 3 steps after `Goods_Received`, exceeding the two-activity window (i.e., it's a violation, not compliant as stated).
- Rule 4 assessment is **incorrect**: The LLM answer misses that there is a `System` event between the CFO and Intern activities, so rule 4 is actually satisfied, not violated.
- Rule 5 assessment is correct.
- Rule 1 is not mentioned at all, though it was satisfied in the trace.

Because of incorrect conclusions for rules 3 and 4 (one false negative, one false positive, both critical), and lack of mention of rule 1, this answer fails more than half the detailed requirements despite the right overall verdict.

Strictly: Score = **4.0**.
