The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes," provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) from the initial marking that reaches a state where T5 has fired while T3 has not (p4=0, p2=1 still pending), with precise stepwise markings and a brief, accurate justification matching the prompt's requirements. This strictly proves possibility as requested.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for:
- Sequence is a prefix excluding T3's firing (though extension T1→T2→T5→T3 is valid and implied; ground truth explicitly includes it before erroneous T4).
- Lacks ground truth's deeper (accurate) insight that T5 *must* precede T3 to ever fire (due to permanent disablement post-T3), though prompt only requires brief justification for possibility.

No factual errors (unlike ground truth's impossible T4 firing at p3=0). Utmost strictness applied, but core match is near-perfect.
