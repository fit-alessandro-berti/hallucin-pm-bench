8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times, with identical quantifications of excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and matching wait times from the table (600s, 480s, 200s). It adheres to memo format, ~150 words, bullets only for recommendations (one concrete action per activity, tied to data waits), no invented metrics/activities, and grounds all claims in supplied data. 

However, strict deductions for: 
- Textual/structure differences vs. ground truth (headers/From/Subject/intro phrasing/listing format as prose paras vs. compact list; interleaved analysis/recs vs. separate sections; different closing without projection).
- Completely different recommendation content (e.g., "assign resources" vs. "rule-based pre-checks"; generic streamlining vs. specific analyst addition/heuristic).
- Minor phrasing variances (e.g., "throughput data" vs. "4 805 cases"; "breaches correlate" vs. "breach...queues").

Semantically faithful (no factual errors), but multiple differences reduce from perfect match.
