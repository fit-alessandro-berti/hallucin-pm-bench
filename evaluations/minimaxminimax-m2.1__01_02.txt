**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major deductions: -4.5 total)**: Ground truth lists **3 explicit decision points** (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval). LLM lists only **2**, omitting the MBA entirely as a standalone decision point despite describing its role indirectly. LLM incorrectly asserts "**two critical decision gates**" (factual error). Descriptions are mostly accurate but rephrase "≤ 2 points" as "2 points or less"/"more than 2 points" (minor phrasing shift, -0.3) and use comma in "€15,000" vs. space in "€15 000" (-0.2).
- **Required Documents (moderate deductions: -1.3 total)**: All 6 listed correctly, matching prompt specs. However, adds unprompted/NOT in ground truth/prompt: "**standard**" for CIS/NFF (-0.3); "**NFF template**" (prompt/GT say only "NFF", no "template" unlike CIS, invention error -0.5); "Completed by both underwriters" explanation (-0.2); table format/elaborations diverge from GT's simple numbered list (-0.3).
- **Other (minor deductions: -0.0)**: Uses exact activity names; no standard terminology introduced. Extra note echoes GT but not identical.
- **Overall**: ~70% fidelity (incomplete core content + inventions); strict policy penalizes omissions/inaccuracies heavily (not 10.0 or even 7.0).
