9.0

The LLM answer provides the correct unified diff for reducing the due date of "Collect Equipment" from 5 days to 2 days, which aligns exactly with the ground truth modification. The rationale is accurate, concise, and clearly explains the SLA-driven benefit of the change.

However, there are two small deviations:
- The rationale refers to "downstream delays" and "overall onboarding completion" but does not mention the target "contractual 3-day SLA" as in the ground truth, missing the explicit SLA compliance aspect.
- The diff output includes only a single line, whereas in the ground truth, an additional `@@` is shown at the end (though this is minor and does not affect the actual suggested change).

These small gaps prevent it from being a perfect 10.0, but the answer is otherwise highly accurate and compliant.
