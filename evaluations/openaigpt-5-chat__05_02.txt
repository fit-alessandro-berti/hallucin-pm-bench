The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the exact same XML modification via a valid unified diff (minor formatting parity with the ground truth, ignoring the extraneous trailing @@ in the ground truth), fully complying with the rules by altering only an existing dueDate attribute without adding/deleting elements or altering flows. However, the rationale sentence, while logically sound and concise, deviates notably from the ground truth by omitting critical specifics like the "contractual 3-day SLA" target and the assurance of "without introducing any new activities" (which reinforces rule adherence), opting instead for a vaguer explanation of "downstream delays" and "overall onboarding completion"â€”this lack of precision and contextual tie-in warrants a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria for differences in explanatory accuracy and completeness.
