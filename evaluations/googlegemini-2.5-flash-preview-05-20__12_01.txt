**Score: 7.0**

**Rationale:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and cites relevant case numbers.
- It provides some detail: for Case 1001 it notes the reversal (though more precise wording would be better), and for 1003 it mentions the actual activities in between.
- However, **it omits analysis for Case 1002**, which is important since the absence of "Update_Inventory" there is a key point in debunking the “always” part of the claim.
- The description of Case 1003 is acceptable but could be clearer — it does not state outright that "Authorize_Refund" comes *after* "Update_Inventory", just that "Authorize_Refund" does not occur immediately before.
- The answer could be crisper and more explicit about the order and the lack of supporting cases, as in the ground-truth.
- Some deduction for not mentioning that the “always” fails immediately when a case lacks the relevant activity entirely.

**Summary:**
Good basic answer and reasoning, but loses significant points for missing Case 1002 and for less clarity/precision than the ground-truth, especially regarding logical conclusiveness.
