**3.0**

The LLM answer correctly concludes "No" overall and identifies the key violation in rule 3, but has major errors: (1) incorrectly claims rule 2 is violated by misreading the trace (VP is after both QE and RA, and after NA—not before NA); (2) wrongly dodges evaluating rule 4 (CC is after both NA and VP, so satisfied); (3) lacks the structured precision of the ground truth table and includes a factual misstatement on VP's position. These are significant inaccuracies despite the correct final answer, warranting major point deduction under strict criteria.
