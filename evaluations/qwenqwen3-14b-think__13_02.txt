The LLM answer is accurate and complete for questions 1 and 2, with exact matches to the deterministic numeric values and percentages (including explanations like 1/48 and 1/12). For question 3, it adheres to the word limit, cautions against over-generalization (e.g., biased predictions from overlooking rarity), and notes some instability (e.g., masking exceptions, skewing assessments). However, it only implies the single-occurrence issue via "rarity/low-support" without explicitly mentioning it, and it emphasizes model overlooking/bias more than statistical variance/instability (e.g., no reference to noise, skewing averages, or wide confidence intervals from n=1), diverging from the ground truth's focus. This partial misalignment in explanatory precision warrants a deduction under strict criteria.
