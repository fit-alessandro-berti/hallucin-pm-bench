The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without forbidden variants and maintains exactly one Responsible (R) per activity, aligning with the primary handlers from the narrative. However, it fails to produce a full RACI matrix by omitting explicit Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments, instead leaving cells blank and incorrectly implying A via single Râ€”directly contradicting the ground truth's detailed allocations (e.g., AM as A or R/A in multiple rows, C/I for secondary roles in every activity). Column headers use abbreviations rather than full role names, adding minor format discrepancies. The added key and note introduce unwarranted explanatory content. These differences result in an incomplete and inaccurate matrix, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria.
