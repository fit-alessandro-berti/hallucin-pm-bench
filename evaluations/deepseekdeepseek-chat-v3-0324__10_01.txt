6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer uses the required terminology strictly ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") and does not mention any forbidden terms.
- The matrix includes all the correct activities and roles.
- No extra (unwarranted) roles, activities, or content are added.

**Errors:**
- **Major Omissions:** The RACI allocations are inaccurate and incomplete compared to the ground truth.
    - Only "R" is used for each activity, omitting the designations A (Accountable), C (Consulted), and I (Informed) where they clearly apply in the ground truth.
    - For example, "Receive Application" should have "R/A" for Account Manager, "C" for Compliance Officer, and "I" for Finance Clerk and IT Support, but the LLM answer lists only "R" for Account Manager and nothing for others.
    - This pattern repeats for all rows: only the principal/Responsible role is marked, and all other participations are omitted.
- **RACI Key Misrepresentation:** The matrix key claims "A" is implied by "R", but this is a major deviation from RACI matrix best practices and the ground truth, where R and A are separately specified when needed.
- **Consulted and Informed roles missing:** The ground truth assigns numerous C and I designations, which are absent from the LLM's version, and even the key incorrectly says "Consulted" and "Informed" are "not applicable".
- **Formatting:** The LLM answer uses role abbreviations in the table but provides full names in the key, while the ground truth is clear and consistent.

**Conclusion:**  
While the vocabulary policy is respected and there's no extra content, the incomplete and inaccurate marking of almost all Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed roles constitutes a significant error. Given that RACI matrices are required to list these responsibilities precisely, and the LLM answer consistently fails to do so, this must incur a major penalty. However, the correct use of preferred terminology and structure warrants a score above failing, resulting in a **6.0**.
