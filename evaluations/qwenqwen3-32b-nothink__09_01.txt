9.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment):** The LLM answer correctly refuses to provide a numeric value, mirroring the ground truth's core assertion that computation is impossible. It directly addresses the lack of timestamps and durations, which is the primary reason given in the ground truth. The structured response (numbered 1 and 2) matches the prompt's format, and the explanation is concise, factual, and avoids fabrication, aligning with the ground truth's emphasis on data insufficiency.
- **Minor Differences (point deduction):** Slight wording variations, e.g., "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed," and the LLM omits explicit mention of "ordering information" or the risk of "fabricated" answers, which the ground truth highlights. The LLM references "sequence of activities and resources" (accurate but unnecessary detail) instead of focusing solely on temporal data absence. These are small semantic/nitpicky discrepancies under strict evaluation, warranting a 0.5-point deduction from a perfect score. No major errors, fabrications, or policy violations.
