The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the data provided and clearly explains that this is due to the absence of timestamps or elapsed-time fields. The reasoning precisely matches the ground truth, accurately identifying that without temporal data, no calculation of cycle time is possible. The answer avoids providing a fabricated value and directly states the limitations of the data, exactly as required by the prompt and ground truth. No errors or omissions are present.
