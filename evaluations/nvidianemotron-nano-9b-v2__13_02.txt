10.0

1. The LLM answer correctly states that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time.  
2. The percentages are calculated exactly: 2.08% of all events (1/48), and 8.33% of all cases (1/12), rounded to two decimals as requested.
3. The explanation for the risk of generalising from a low-support activity is accurate: it refers to bias, overemphasising importance, and the possibility of skewed metrics due to rarityâ€”thus addressing single-occurrence effects, instability, and the risk of over-generalisation.

There are no errors or omissions; the answer matches both the facts and guidance in the ground truth.
