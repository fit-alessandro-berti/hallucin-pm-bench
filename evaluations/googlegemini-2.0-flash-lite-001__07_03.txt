The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks, the removed task, and the two gateway changes with exact IDs, names, and type transitions, matching the ground truth semantically. However, strict deduction for formatting differences: extraneous leading dashes before each of the three headings (not verbatim as required); unnecessary backticks around task IDs (absent in ground truth); inconsistent backticks on gateway lines (present only on the first, absent in ground truth); and lack of alignment spaces in the second gateway line (present in ground truth for "Gateway_Payment"). These small but multiple formatting errors warrant a 1.5-point deduction from a perfect score.
