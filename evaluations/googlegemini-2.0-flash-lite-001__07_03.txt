8.0

The LLM answer includes all required changes, and the content is correct, but it loses two points for these reasons:
- The headings are formatted incorrectly (bulleted vs. verbatim, missing capitalization and line spacing).
- The task entries are bulleted instead of the required dash format.
- The gateway changes do not match the exact verbatim formatting (name alignment, spacing, and colon alignment).

Per instruction, even such formatting and verbatim differences are significant and should markedly reduce the score. No content errors detected.
