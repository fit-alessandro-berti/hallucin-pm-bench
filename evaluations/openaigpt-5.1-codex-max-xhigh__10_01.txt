**4.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Policy (STRICT - 20% weight)**: Perfect compliance. Uses exact "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance" with correct capitalization. No forbidden terms. (+2.0 points)
- **Structure & Formatting (20% weight)**: Table format mostly matches (rows/columns correct, no extras). However, column headers include unwarranted abbreviations "(AM)" etc. (GT omits); inconsistent slash spacing ("A / R" vs "A/R"); no bolding on key cells/activity names as in GT; minor alignment/padding diffs. Significant deductions for non-identical presentation. (+0.5 points)
- **RACI Allocations Correctness (50% weight)**: Major failures vs. GT and narrative reflection.
  - Exactly one R per row: LLM complies superficially (via A/R), but ignores nuanced separation (e.g., GT splits R/A, adds AM A where "appropriate").
  - Per-row diffs (24 cells):
    | Activity | Matching Cells | Key Errors |
    |----------|----------------|------------|
    | Receive Application | 3/4 (AM ~R/A, FC/IT I) | CO: I vs **C** |
    | KYC Review | 1/4 (IT I) | AM: I vs **A**; CO: A/R vs **R**; FC: I vs C (total mismatch) |
    | Order Vetting | 3/4 | CO: I vs C |
    | Payment Clearance | 1/4 (IT I) | AM: I vs A; CO: I vs C; FC: A/R vs **R** (total mismatch) |
    | Record Update | 2/4 (CO/IT ~I/R) | AM: I vs C; FC: I vs C |
    | Notify Customer | 4/4 | None |
  - Overall: 14/24 cells approximate (~58%), but no C's at all (GT has 9 C's); misses AM accountability (GT A/R/A in 5/6 rows); A/R on wrong roles (e.g., no AM A for KYC/Payment). Does not "reflect narrative" per notes (handler = R, but AM A "where appropriate", logical C's omitted). Heavy deductions. (+1.2 points)
- **Unwarranted Content (10% weight)**: None (no extra tasks/roles/columns). (+0.5 points)

**Total: 4.2/10.0**. LLM captures basics (terms, one R/row, handlers as primary) but fails strict GT matching with pervasive RACI errors, ignoring C's/AM A/nuance. Small diffs (slashes, headers) compound losses per strictness rule.
