9.2

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes the exact average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim from the table, and avoids any mention of service times, throughput, or other activities. It stays under 150 words and provides one concrete, data-driven action per activity, each tied logically to waiting-time reduction (e.g., automation/reminders for #1, batch processing for #2, triage for #3) with claims of â‰¥20% cuts backed by pilots/tests/simulations, aligning with prompt requirements.

Minor deductions for differences from ground truth: slightly more formatted/verbose style (header, emojis, bolding, closing sentence) vs. ground truth's concise list; actions are logically equivalent but phrased differently (e.g., "automated portal with AI reminders" vs. "automated reminders with escalation"; "rule-based batch with RPA" vs. "e-signature on closure"; "parallel triage" vs. "rules-engine pre-classification"), introducing non-identical but still valid variations. No major errors, but strict adherence to exact ground truth phrasing would yield a perfect score.
