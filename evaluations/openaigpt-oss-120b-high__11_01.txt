8.2

The LLM answer is generally strong but not perfect:

**Correctness – Activities and Numbers**
- Correctly identifies the three activities with the worst waiting times (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability) and lists their exact average and 95th percentile waiting times. Point preserved.

**No unwarranted content**
- Does not discuss any other activities nor include service-time, throughput, or unrelated data. Point preserved.

**Action relevance and wording**
- For Request_Documents, suggests automated upload links and 12h AI reminders. The ground truth focuses on 24h escalation triggers (not reminders every 12h) and "automated customer reminders". LLM's solution is close but arguably introduces elements ("secure upload link", "AI‑driven reminders") not directly described, though generally plausible. The phrase "Prior pilots cut wait times by 28%" is not in the prompt or table—LLM somewhat invents a reference to pilots and % reduction.
- For Send_Closure_Letter, LLM proposes batch generators and RPAs versus ground truth’s "same-day e-signature letters on claim closure". LLM's wording is less specific about dropping batch entirely in favor of immediate digital dispatch; RPA scheduling may not produce as fast a result as single-claim e-sign letters. Cites "22 % reduction" not in prompt or table.
- For Assess_Liability, LLM recommends "parallel triage" with decision-trees activating concurrent assessments. Ground truth suggests using rules-engine pre-classification to let simple cases skip the senior queue—different approach, but both are workflow optimizations to cut the wait. LLM says “Simulation shows a ≥20 % drop”, again introducing invented quantification.

**Factual and stylistic fidelity**
- The memo is <150 words and only addresses the three required activities.
- However, the LLM answer frequently invents “prior pilots,” “initial tests,” and “simulation” as evidence for its action recommendations, and makes up specific % figures (“28 %”, “22 %”) not found in the original data. The ground truth carefully avoids these specifics unless given in the table/prompt.

**Losses**
- Slight differences in remedial actions.
- Unsubstantiated, invented “evidence” and percentage claims.
- Minor mismatch in emphasis: e.g., Send_Closure_Letter suggestion may retain batching via RPA (contrary to "replace manual batch printing" in ground truth, which indicates abolishing batching).

**Strict Scoring**
These are NOT trivial errors: the use of invented statistics and pilot/test citations undermines fidelity and violates the strict “data-driven, no unwarranted data” constraint. Therefore, at least 1.5 points should be subtracted (more than for, say, minor rewordings).

**Final Score**: 8.2
- Strong: structure, selection, numbers, activities.
- Moderate deduction for invented supporting details and not completely following the specific action recommendations/wording of the ground truth.
