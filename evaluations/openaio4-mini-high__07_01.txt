The LLM answer captures the factual differences but does not meet the strict requirements for format and detail:

- It lists task IDs only under "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks," omitting the required task names and the explicit "id = ..." notation required.
- It does not bold or clearly distinguish categories, and the structure does not match the "exact headings" requested.
- It abbreviates the gateway type change instead of providing the full required detail and formatting.
- It omits the "(none)" line for categories with no items, though in this case all have entries.

While the main substantive content is correct, several formatting and informational requirements have been missed, which warrants a significant but not maximal deduction.
