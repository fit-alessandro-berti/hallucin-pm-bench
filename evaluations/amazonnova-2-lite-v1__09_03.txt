The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in substance: both correctly identify the impossibility due to redacted event rows and missing timestamps in Artefact A, specify the lack of data for "Approve Invoice" durations/statistics, and keep explanations concise (one paragraph). Minor deductions for: (1) non-plain-text formatting ("### Response" header and bolding), violating the "plain text, no tables" instruction; (2) slight imprecision claiming "first five lines... entirely redacted—including critical fields such as `case_id`, `activity`" (headers/column names are present, only data/timestamps redacted); (3) unnecessary elaboration on Artefact B's content (ground truth omits it, focusing precisely on data absence). These small issues warrant a strict but not severe penalty given the near-identical core reasoning.
