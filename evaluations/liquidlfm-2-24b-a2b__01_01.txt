**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% penalty)**: LLM identifies **7 points**, including non-decisions (e.g., #1 submission is not a decision; #5 auditor completion is a constraint, not a decision point; #6 authorization check and #7 letter issuance are procedural checks, not branching decisions). Ground truth has exactly **3 precise points** (eligibility, threshold, final approval). LLM over-invents, misphrases (e.g., no explicit "BankTransferAuthorization present?" decision), and ignores implied rejection outcomes. Fails "summarise **every** decision point" accurately without extras.
- **Required Documents (Moderate Errors, ~25% penalty)**: Lists all 7 correctly but miscounts as "6 distinct," adds undefined detail "**signed by customer**" for *BankTransferAuthorization* (prompt says only "signed *BankTransferAuthorization* is present"—violates "Do not introduce any... artefacts not defined"). Ground truth notes conditional *AuditTrail* but includes it properly.
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity (Minor but Penalized, ~12% penalty)**: Wrong counts in summary (7 points/6 docs vs. ground truth's implicit precision). No table/list match; introduces unrequested summary. Ignores "legacy activity" note partially.
- **Strictness Applied**: Small intro of "signed by customer" = intro of undefined artifact → big deduction. Total mismatches in core content justify low score; partial doc accuracy prevents 1.0.
