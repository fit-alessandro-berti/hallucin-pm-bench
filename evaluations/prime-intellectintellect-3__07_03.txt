9.0

The LLM answer is functionally perfect: it correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). No extra or missing changes, no commentary, headings verbatim and in order.

Minor formatting differences from ground truth deduct 1.0 point under utmost strictness:
- Missing "-" bullets before each item (5 instances).
- Extra blank lines after headings and between items/sections.
- No alignment spaces in second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").

These are small but per instructions warrant significant (but not total) loss; content fidelity justifies high score.
