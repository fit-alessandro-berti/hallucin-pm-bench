The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth across all questions, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. Question 1 correctly states 1 occurrence. Question 2 matches the calculation and rounded percentage precisely. Question 3 identifies the exact case (A1002) without extras. Question 4 provides two valid, clearly stated sampling-related reasons (small sample size and temporal bias) that align directly with the ground truth options, derived solely from the log fragment.
