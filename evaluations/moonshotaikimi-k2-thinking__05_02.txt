The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the core XML change (modifying the `camunda:dueDate` for `Task_CollectEquipment` from "P5D" to "P2D") but loses significant points for deviations in the unified diff format (includes unnecessary context lines and line numbers, whereas the ground truth uses a minimal single-hunk without them) and especially the rationale (invents a non-matching 10-day SLA with unsubstantiated 25% cycle time and bottleneck claims, ignores emphasis on no new activities, and differs entirely in wording, structure, and factual alignment from the ground truth's 3-day SLA reference).
