**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correct Final Answer (Major Credit)**: Both conclude **Yes** with a valid core firing sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** proving T5 fires before T3. This matches the prompt's requirement for possibility + sequence + brief justification (+4.0 points).
- **Significant Structural & Presentation Flaws (Heavy Deduction)**: LLM starts with contradictory **"No"** header and **"Proof of Impossibility"** section, then flips to Yes—confusing and directly mismatches ground truth's clean **Yes** opening (-1.5). Rambling analysis with redundant steps vs. ground truth's concise format (-0.5).
- **Factual/Analysis Errors (Major Deduction)**: Incorrectly states "T5 is **still not enabled**" immediately after T2 (when p3=1, p4=0 enables it), with garbled wording ("**p4 = 0** is required, but **T5 also requires p4 = 0**, which is true, **but**...")—clear analytical slip (-1.0).
- **Incomplete Justification & Depth (Moderate Deduction)**: Brief note on enabling conditions correct but superficial; omits ground truth's key insight (T5 *must* precede T3 due to permanent disablement post-T3 via inhibitor/p4 dynamics) and full sequence (T3/T4 after T5) (-0.5).
- **Minor Issues**: Partial markings listed but less precise/inline than ground truth; no emphasis on inhibitor's irreversibility (-0.5).

**Net**: Correct outcome salvages partial score, but strict policy demands heavy penalties for contradictions, errors, and deviations—far from ground truth's precision.
