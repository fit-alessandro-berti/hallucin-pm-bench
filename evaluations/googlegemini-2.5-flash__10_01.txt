6.5

The LLM answer earns a 6.5/10.0. Here's a breakdown based on the rubric and comparison with the ground truth:

**Strengths:**
- The LLM rigorously follows the strict vocabulary policy: all three mandated terms are used exactly as required and the forbidden terms never appear.
- No extra roles, columns, or activities are introduced.
- Matrix is formatted clearly (activities as rows, roles as columns).

**Errors and Deviations:**
- **RACI Assignments Incorrect:**  
  Compared to the ground truth, the Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments are oversimplified/missing nuance:
  - The LLM assigns only R, A, or I, and sometimes combines R, A in one cell—this is not standard RACI notation. "R / A" is preferred (as in the ground truth) to show one person is both Responsible and Accountable.
  - Several roles that should be marked as C (Consulted) or I (Informed) per the ground truth are simply left empty, which is misleading.
  - Examples:
    - "Receive Application": FC and IT are I in ground truth, but blank here.
    - "KYC Review": AM is A in ground truth, but marked I here; FC is C in ground truth, missing here.
    - "Order Vetting": CO is C and IT is I in ground truth, missing here.
    - "Payment Clearance": AM is A and CO is C in ground truth, missing here.
    - "Record Update": Only IT marked (R, A); AM and FC are C in ground truth, CO is I—all missing.
    - "Notify Customer": CO, FC, IT are I in ground truth, missing here.
- **Matrix does not distinguish C and I properly.** There are no C assignments at all, which is a significant omission.
- **Accountability**: In some cases, the ground truth assigns A separately from R; the LLM answer often merges R and A, reducing important process nuance.

**Summary of Severity:**
- Adheres to strict terminology policy. (+3.5)
- Matrix structure and roles/activities correct. (+2)
- Multiple, consistent errors in RACI assignments, over-simplified matrix, and lack of C/I distinctions. (–3.5)

Thus, 6.5 reflects strict deduction for each role-matrix cell in error, but credits for format and adherence to vocabulary policy.
