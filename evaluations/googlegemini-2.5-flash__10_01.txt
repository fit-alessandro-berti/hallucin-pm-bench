The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without forbidden variants, matches the activity rows and role columns without additions, and ensures one Responsible per activity. However, it scores extremely low due to widespread inaccuracies in RACI assignments compared to the ground truth: misplaced Accountable roles (e.g., CO as A for KYC Review instead of AM; IT as A for Record Update, unsupported by narrative), incorrect Inform/Consult (e.g., AM as I for Payment Clearance instead of A; missing multiple I/C assignments like CO:C/FC:I/IT:I for Receive Application and Order Vetting), and omissions of key Consult/Inform roles across nearly all activities (e.g., no CO:I/FC:I/IT:I for Notify Customer). These are not minor; they fundamentally misrepresent the process responsibilities, violating strict rubric criteria for narrative reflection and exactness, warranting severe deduction.
