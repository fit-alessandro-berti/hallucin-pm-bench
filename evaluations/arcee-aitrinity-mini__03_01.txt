**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth and prompt constraints:

- **Logic errors (major deductions)**: Gw2 branches incorrectly to "Specialist Resolution" (invented task) or directly to "Confirm Ticket" (skips "Resolve Issue"; misimplements lines 4-6). No distinct "Forward to Specialist" → "Resolve Issue" path. Password reset → confirm skips diagnosis correctly but overall flow mismatches.
- **Invented elements (violates "do not invent"; prompt rule)**: "Customer Submission" task (submit is start event); "Specialist Resolution"; dataInputAssociation/*SortingData*, dataOutputItem/*Path*, dataInputType (non-standard condition hacks); diverterRef (invalid BPMN attribute); association misused as flow (t5→gw3); two endEvents (ESuccess/EWrongResult; unused second); serviceTask instead of task; explicitLayout, exporter, extra namespaces (bpmn:, script:, dmn:, xs:).
- **Missing/critical omissions**: No "Auto-Classification" task (line 2); no "Resolve Issue" task; no conditionExpression (e.g., yes/no on flows; ground truth has them); no <?xml declaration>.
- **Naming mismatches**: "Classification Check" (not "Password Reset?"); "Resolve or Specialist" (not "Resolved Internally?"); "Confirm Ticket" (not "Confirm with Customer"); "Confirmation Check" (not "Customer Confirms?").
- **Structural/standards violations**: Bloated (>40 lines); invalid XML (e.g., diverterRef, dataInputType not BPMN 2.0); process ID "Process_1"; startEvent lacks name; no concise IDs on flows.
- **Extra gateways**: Three gateways OK (prompt says "two" but description implies three; ground truth uses three), but irrelevant given other failures.

Zero fidelity to ground truth XML structure, flow, or minimalism. Unrunnable BPMN with hallucinations.
