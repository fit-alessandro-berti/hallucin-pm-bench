8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Perfect match (3). Score: 10/10.
- **Q2**: Exact sequence match, including separators and order. Score: 10/10.
- **Q3**: Correct distinct activities identified (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock). However, the list is not alphabetically ordered as explicitly required (should be Arrange_Delivery first, then Check_Stock). The reversed order is a clear instruction violation, and while the format is close (one per line), the lack of precise sorting deducts significantly under strict criteria. No hallucinations or extras, but the ordering error alone warrants a penalty. Score: 5/10.

Overall average: (10 + 10 + 5)/3 = 8.33, rounded to 8.5 considering the weighted impact of the single but notable error in a multi-part response.
