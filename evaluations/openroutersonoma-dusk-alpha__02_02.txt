9.5

Q1: Correct (3) – full credit.
Q2: Correct ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order") – full credit.
Q3: Content is correct ("Check_Stock" and "Arrange_Delivery") and in the correct order, but the LLM answer omitted the backslash escape (_) in the activity names, which in a strict context does count as a minor error compared to the ground truth ("Arrange_Delivery" vs "Arrange\_Delivery", "Check_Stock" vs "Check\_Stock"). This is a very minor mismatch (formatting only, not factual).

Based on the prompt for utmost strictness, even this minor formatting error should result in a significant loss of points, as instructed.

Reasoning:  
- 0 points lost for Q1 and Q2 (exact match).  
- Minor penalty for Q3 (formatting): -0.5.

Final score: **9.5**
