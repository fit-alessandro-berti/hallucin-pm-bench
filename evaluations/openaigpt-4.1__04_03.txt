8.0

The LLM answer gets the overall compliance decision correct and correctly identifies the violation (Rule 3) as well as the satisfaction of the other rules. However, there are several errors and issues that merit point deductions according to strict standards:

- Under **Rule 1**, the LLM says "Violated" in the summary line, but its own textual justification correctly details that QE and RA occur in order and once each (and even says "(correct)"), so the "Violated" label is incorrect/confusing. This is a significant error in marking.
- For **Rule 2**, the LLM writes "Violated", but then acknowledges the rule is "correct" in the justification. This internal contradiction undermines accuracy and would confuse an auditor.
- For **Rule 3** and **Rule 4**, the analysis is correct and matches the ground truth.
- The summary focuses on the correct rule as violated, but the mixed labeling in the per-rule list is a substantial formatting error.

Therefore, while the key determination and reasoning are present, the mislabeling/conflicting statements for Rules 1 and 2 are significant enough to merit a larger point loss than a minor errorâ€”thus, 8.0.
