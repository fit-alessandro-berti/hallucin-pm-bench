10.0

The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth in both conclusion and reasoning:

- It clearly states that the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be derived.
- The explanation is specific: timestamps and elapsed-time fields are missing, making calculation of cycle time impossible.
- It distinguishes historical benchmarks as irrelevant for the requested calculation.
- The answer neither fabricates data nor over-interprets the context.

No errors or omissions are present compared to the ground truth; therefore, the maximum score is appropriate.
