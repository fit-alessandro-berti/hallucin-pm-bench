**9.4**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Overall Match**: Extremely high fidelity to ground truth in identifying and describing the exact 3 decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)) using precise terminology from the prompt. All conditions, thresholds (€15 000), actors (e.g., underwriters, board), and outcomes match semantically. Documents list is 100% complete and accurate to prompt (6 items), with LLM even retaining fuller phrasing from prompt (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)", "(CIS) template", "single pay-stub or tax slip") where GT abbreviates.
- **Strengths (no deduction)**: No factual errors, no introduced terminology, exact activity names used, logical sequence implied correctly (e.g., Alignment → NFC → Amount Threshold).
- **Differences/Deductions (strict, significant for small variances, total -0.6)**:
  - **Formatting/Structure (-0.2)**: "##" headers and bullets vs GT's "####" and numbered lists; extra "(using the exact activity names)" and "(complete list)" phrases; inconsistent bolding/capitalization (e.g., "approve/reject" lowercase vs GT "**Approve** or **Reject**").
  - **Phrasing/Conciseness (-0.2)**: More verbose (e.g., "Condition: compare... If... Else...", "proceeds to **Disburse Funds**; if rejected, the process ends without disbursement") vs GT's minimal "*If... ⇒ ...*". Adds accurate but non-GT inferences.
  - **Context Omission (-0.2)**: Lacks GT's explicit positioning ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check", "send to").
  - **Missing Element (-0)**: No deduction for absent GT note ("*No credit bureau...*"), as prompt doesn't require it.
- **Strictness Note**: Semantic equivalence is near-perfect (95%+), but stylistic/phrasing variances treated as small errors with proportional significant impact per instructions. No major deviations justify lower.
