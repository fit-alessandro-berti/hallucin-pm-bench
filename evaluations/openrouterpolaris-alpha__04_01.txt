### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and pinpoints the exact violations (Rules 2 and 3) matching the ground truth, with accurate details on Rule 2 (reversed order of `Ship_Goods` and `Risk_Assessment`). It also correctly assesses Rules 1, 4, and 5 as satisfied. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Structural differences (major deduction -2.0 points)**: The ground truth uses a clear, systematic numbered list (1-5) evaluating each rule individually before concluding overall non-compliance. The LLM uses a messy structure: point 1 for Rule 2, then point 2 claiming "all other relevant rules are satisfied" (contradictory wording, as it later admits Rule 3 violation), with rambling subpoints (e.g., 2.2 unnecessarily discusses "overshadowed by stricter reading" and buries the violation). This deviates significantly from the clean, rule-by-rule format.

- **Explanatory inaccuracies (moderate deduction -1.0 points)**: For Rule 3, the LLM correctly flags the violation but miscounts the distance as "4 steps away" or "4th event after" (listing 7,8,9,then 10), while the ground truth specifies "distance = 3" (with precise reference to next two activities as 7 and 8). This is a small but clear factual discrepancy in quantification, warranting significant loss per instructions. The explanation is also verbose and less precise than the ground truth's concise "next two activities are events 7 and 8... distance = 3."

Substance is strong (80% alignment on key facts), but form and precision errors reduce the score. No other major deviations (e.g., no missed rules or wrong compliance status).
