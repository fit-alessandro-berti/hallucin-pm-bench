**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment, preserving most points)**: Identical selection of the three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), correctly justified by key metrics from the table (e.g., throughput drops, wait/processing times, rework, SLA breaches, stdev). Memo format, conciseness (<200 words), and structure (list with why + one action each) match closely. References *strictly* table data without hallucinations or absent activities. Adds value with "statistically distinguishable" note, aligning with prompt's guidance on unclear differentiation.
- **Differences/Deductions (-0.8 total, strict per instruction)**: 
  - Explanations include mild speculation beyond raw data (e.g., "customer/caller delays", "inconsistent reviewer training", explicit "feeds downstream" causality; -0.3). Ground truth sticks closer to metrics-only phrasing.
  - Actions are concrete/data-driven but diverge entirely in specifics/content from ground truth (-0.3).
  - Minor stylistic variances (headers, emphasis, e.g., LLM notes stdev ±9 explicitly; ground truth projects untable metrics like "10% lift"; -0.2).
No factual errors or task violations; high fidelity despite differences.
