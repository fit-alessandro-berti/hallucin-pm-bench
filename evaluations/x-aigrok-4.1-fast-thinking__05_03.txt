4.2

### Key Differences and Deductions (Strict Evaluation):
- **Critical Semantic Error (-3.5 points)**: `cancelActivity="false"` (non-interrupting) vs. ground truth `"true"` (interrupting). Non-interrupting allows the breaching task to continue unchecked, failing true SLA *enforcement*; interrupting cancels it for escalation—core to compliance.
- **Missing Elements (-1.0)**: No `name="48h breach"` on boundary event; no explanatory comments (e.g., `<!-- ❶ -->`).
- **XML Variations (-0.5)**: Different IDs (`Timer_CreateAccount`/`Flow_09` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`/`Flow_LateEscalation`); minor but unnecessary divergence.
- **Justification Mismatch (-0.8)**: Describes *non-interrupting* (wrong); adds extraneous details ("start of account creation (immediately following...)"); phrased as imperative ("Add a...") vs. declarative; no bolding or exact structure (`*Justification (1 sentence):*`).
- **Partial Credits (+4.2 base)**: Correct task (`Activity_CreateAccount`), duration (`PT48H`), target (`Activity_AMReview`), no new activities, one-sentence format, BPMN validity.

Overall: Conceptually close but critically flawed in enforcement mechanism; strictness demands heavy penalty for functional inaccuracy.
