### Evaluation Rationale
**Content Accuracy (10/10):** The LLM correctly identifies *all* and *only* the relevant changes:
- Added: Exactly the three new tasks (`Task_VerifyIdentity`, `Task_RequestDocs`, `Task_FinalReject`).
- Removed: Exactly the one removed task (`Task_RejectLoan`).
- Gateway: Correct type change for `Gateway_Decision` (exclusive → inclusive). Ignores renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name), as instructed. No misses or extras.

**Completeness (10/10):** Covers every change strictly under the three exact headings. No extraneous info.

**Strictness Deductions (-0.8 total):**
- **Presentation/format mismatches (-0.3):** Uses `###` headings (H3) vs. ground truth's `* **Heading**` (italic-bold); bullets `•` vs. numbered `1.` lists; ID-first `(name)` vs. **name**-first `` `ID` ``.
- **Gateway phrasing (-0.3):** Concise "Exclusive Gateway → Inclusive Gateway" omits explicit "(XOR)" / "(OR)" acronyms, *v1*/*v2* references, and full wording "changed from **exclusive** ... to **inclusive**".
- **Minor omissions (-0.2):** Lacks ground truth's overall "## **Expected Answer Key**" header and closing note "*(No other ...)*" (though unnecessary for task).

Semantically perfect; deductions only for non-identical styling/wording under utmost strictness.
