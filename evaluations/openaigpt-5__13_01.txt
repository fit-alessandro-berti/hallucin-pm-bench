10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in substance, accuracy, and adherence to the log data without inference or hallucination. All factual elements match exactly (Q1â€“Q3), and Q4 provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons that align closely with the ground truth examples (small sample/temporal bias and selection bias via non-random sampling). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., conciseness in Q1/Q3, formatting in Q2) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they preserve correctness and derive solely from the provided log.
