9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). Full points.
- **Question 2**: Accurate calculation and result (5.56%), with explicit math shown. Minor deduction for LaTeX formatting and slight phrasing ("includes" vs. "does this represent"), but negligible impact.
- **Question 3**: Exact match (identifies only A1002 correctly). Full points.
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, relevant sampling reasons that align well with ground truth options (small sample size and temporal bias). However, strict evaluation notes minor deviations: (1) "Overfitting to specific trends or outliers" in the sample size explanation introduces a slightly extraneous ML concept not directly echoed in ground truth's variance-focused example, risking minor inference beyond strict log derivation; (2) "Temporal and Contextual Bias" adds ungrounded specifics (e.g., "weekends, holidays, seasonal changes") not in the log or ground truth's concise temporal bias description, though the core idea (single-day limitation) is spot-on. These small expansions reduce precision, costing ~0.8 points overall from a potential 10.

Total score reflects high fidelity to ground truth with strict penalties for subtle wording/inference differences, ensuring no hallucination but penalizing non-exact phrasing.
