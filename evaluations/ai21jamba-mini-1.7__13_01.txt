9.0

Explanation:

- Q1: The answer is correct: "exactly once."
- Q2: Correct computation and percentage: 5.56%.
- Q3: Correct: Only "A1002" contains the activity.
- Q4: Both listed reasons (Limited Sample Size; Temporal and Contextual Bias) are valid, but the explanation for "Temporal and Contextual Bias" says "fluctuations due to ... external factors (e.g., seasonal changes, weekends, or holidays)," which brings in knowledge about weekends/holidays that is not derivable from the log fragment (which covers only the morning of a single day). Including seasonal/holiday variability is an extraneous assumption, and the explanation could have more strictly referenced just the observed range in the data.

- The "overfitting to specific trends or outliers" point in Q4's first item is okay but not precise for this context; the main observed disadvantage is high variance due to small sample.
- The "case-mix bias" and "survivorship/truncation bias" from the ground truth were not mentioned, which, while not strictly necessary if other valid sampling errors are given, indicates the LLM is slightly less thorough about the different types of bias possible given the fragment.

Due to a very minor issue of reasoning in Q4 (extraneous detail in "external factors"), I deduct 1.0 point. No hallucination or direct error; just not maximal rigor.
