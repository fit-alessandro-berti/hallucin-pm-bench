6.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Count)**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence, correctly identified). Full points here (10/10).
- **Part 2 (Explanation)**: Core idea of small sample leading to misestimation is shared, with accurate details on excerpt size (3 cases, ~2-hour window, 14 events). However, significant deductions for: (1) speculation violating "no speculation" rule (e.g., assuming full log has "hundreds of cases," "other branches/later dates," invented variant "Manual Fraud Verification"—none in data); (2) omission of key ground truth elements like frequency volatility (0% to 7% swing), wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events, and string-matching pitfalls with actual data examples ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)"); (3) overemphasis on "selection bias" without statistical depth; (4) word count compliant (~90 words) but less precise/analytical. This introduces meaningful differences, reducing score (3/10 for this part).
- **Overall**: Weighted average; strict per instructions—speculation and omissions are not minor, reflecting ~35% deviation from ground truth fidelity.
