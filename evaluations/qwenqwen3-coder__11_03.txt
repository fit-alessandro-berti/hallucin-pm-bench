3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, aligning with the ground truth selection. The overall memo structure is executive-appropriate, uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations, and stays within ~150 words while grounding in provided data (e.g., referencing throughput, waiting times, and SLAs without extraneous metrics). However, it incurs severe penalties for fundamental errors:

- **Critical quantification inaccuracies (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: The excesses are miscalculated throughout. Legal Approval exceeds by 300s (not 900s); Risk Review by 300s (not 780s); Credit Assessment by 60s (not 260s). These are not minor; they invert the data's meaning (confusing total throughput with excess), directly violating the prompt's requirement to quantify excesses precisely and ground in data. Even one such error would warrant significant loss; three compound it.

- **Recommendations differences (moderate deduction: -1.5 points)**: While concrete and somewhat data-driven (e.g., Risk Review ties to 480s wait), they diverge substantially from ground truth in specificity and phrasing (e.g., LLM suggests "parallel review streams" vs. ground truth's "rule-based pre-checks"; no mention of "one risk analyst" or "â‚¬25k loans"). LLM's are more generic and less tailored, reducing alignment.

- **Minor structural/content variances (minor deduction: -1.0 point)**: Header includes invented "[Current Date]" (absent from data); introductory analysis is vaguer ("significant performance gaps") than ground truth's case-total reference (though ground truth also invents "4,805 cases" and "April 2025"). No projection of impacts (ground truth adds 35% reduction, invented but absent in LLM).

Overall, the answer captures the prompt's intent but is undermined by data misrepresentation, yielding a low score under strict criteria.
