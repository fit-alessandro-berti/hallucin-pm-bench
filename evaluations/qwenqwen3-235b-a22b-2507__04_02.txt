The LLM answer is mostly accurate but has a critical error in R2 (incorrectly deems Compliant instead of Violated, misunderstanding "last required approval" after Change_Request, leading to wrong timing analysis). Justifications are concise and within limits, and other rules match ground truth status and intent, with minor phrasing differences in R1 and R5 not warranting further deduction. Overall result correct, but the R2 flaw significantly impacts compliance assessment strictness.
