6.0

The LLM answer mostly follows the required answer format, evaluates each rule, gives a status, and usually a justification. The overall result is correct (NON-COMPLIANT). However, there are some significant errors when compared to the ground truth:

- R2: The LLM marks R2 as Compliant, but this is incorrect. After a Change_Request (after approvals), a new Manager_Approval is required before “further processing” (including Ship_Goods), and the 2-day window should be counted from the *last required approval* (here, the new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07). Ship_Goods occurs on 2025-03-05, before this new approval, so R2 is violated. This is a substantive error and alone would be a 2–3 point deduction.

- R5: The LLM does catch the violation, but the justification is somewhat incomplete. While it notes the Change_Request after Finance_Approval and no new Manager_Approval before Ship_Goods, it doesn’t mention that Pay_Invoice also occurs (further processing step) before the new Manager_Approval. This is a minor issue, but more points off due to strictness.

- R3: The LLM gets R3 correct (violation) with a proper justification.

- R4: Correctly identified as Not Applicable.

- R1 and R6: Correctly identified as Compliant.

- Formatting and clarity: The answer is relatively clear, but the error in R2 is significant, and the R5 justification could be more detailed (as per the strictness instructions).

- Minor mistakes (incorrect R2 status and partial justification for R5) must be heavily penalized per prompt instruction for “utmost strictness.”  
- Overall, two major issues (R2 status and lack of detail in R5) justify lowering the score below 7, but most logic is present and clear.
