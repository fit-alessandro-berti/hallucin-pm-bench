6.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Factual completeness (major deduction)**: LLM correctly identifies all 3 added tasks and 1 removed task. However, it misses the **Gateway_Payment** type change (exclusive → parallel), which is explicitly verifiable in the XML (v1: `exclusiveGateway`; v2: `parallelGateway`). This omits 50% of gateway changes, violating "summarise *all* functional changes". -3.0 points.
- **Formatting differences (significant deduction per strictness rule)**: Ground truth uses bullet points (`- `) before every item (7 total bullets across sections). LLM omits all bullets, listing items plain. Prompt does not explicitly require bullets, but ground truth does, creating direct textual differences on every list item. Example gateway format matches LLM's colon+space, but list style diverges. -1.0 point total.
- **Other**: Headings verbatim and in order ✓. No extras/commentary ✓. Task/gateway phrasing exact (id (name) or id: old → new) ✓. No unchanged elements mentioned ✓.

Overall: Strong on most content (80% accurate), but critical omission + format mismatches warrant low-mid score under "utmost strictness" and "significant loss" for errors. Perfect match = 10.0; this is substantially divergent.
