**9.8**

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in correctness, sequence (T1→T2→T7→T4→T5), markings, and core explanation (alternative path via T2-T7 to P4/P5 preserves P2 for T5 without T3). Both confirm "Yes" for Q1 and provide a minimal 5-step demonstration under 120 words.

Minor deductions (-0.2): 
- Stylistic differences (table vs. inline numbered list with M_i notation; "upper branch" phrasing absent in ground truth).
- Lacks ground truth's explicit note on T5 consuming P2/disabling T3 afterward (minor emphasis, not required). 

No factual errors; utmost strictness applied to presentation variances.
