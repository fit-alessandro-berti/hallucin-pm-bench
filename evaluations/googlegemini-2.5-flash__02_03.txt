9.0

- The LLM answers all three questions correctly in terms of the chosen options.
- For Q1, the answer "3" is correct but does not list the case names as in the ground truth ("C123, C456, C789"). This is a minor but clear omission of detail.
- For Q2, "Pack_Items" is correct and matches the ground truth.
- For Q3, "Cancel_Order" is correct and matches the ground truth.
- The answer is concise and uses bullets as requested.

**Deduction:** -1 point for not specifically listing the case identifiers (C123, C456, C789) in answer 1 as in the ground truth. Otherwise accurate and concise.
