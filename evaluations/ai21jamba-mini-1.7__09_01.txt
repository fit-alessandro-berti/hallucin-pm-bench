The LLM answer fails to adhere to the system instruction by not clearly stating that the value cannot be derived from the data. Instead, it attempts an invalid calculation outline, miscounts occurrences (3 instead of 4), proposes a flawed method relying on absent timestamps, and implies a hypothetical computation is possible with unavailable data. This directly contradicts the ground truth, which correctly identifies the impossibility due to missing temporal information, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
