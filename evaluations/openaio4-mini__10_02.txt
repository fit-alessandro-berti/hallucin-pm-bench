3.5

The LLM answer is significantly deficient compared to the ground truth, with the following key issues:

1. **Omission of "Operations Manager":**  
   The ground truth includes an “Operations Manager” as the Accountable party for every task. The LLM answer omits this role entirely, leaving "Accountable" assignments either blank or incorrectly assigned.

2. **Inclusion/Handling of IT Support:**  
   The ground truth treats “IT Support” as Responsible for archiving and as Consulted across several tasks. The LLM answer does not mention "IT Support" at all, despite its explicit mention in the process description and ground truth. Instead, “SWIFT message” and “archival” are inappropriately assigned to "Transaction Analyst".

3. **Task Collation/Conflation:**  
   - The LLM splits steps into more tasks than in the ground truth (for example, it creates “Notify Regulatory Liaison of archival” which is not an actual task in the description or ground truth).
   - “Send SWIFT message” is erroneously assigned to "Transaction Analyst" instead of "IT Support".

4. **Misallocation of RACI Codes:**  
   - For instance, the "Regulatory Liaison" is assigned both Responsible and Accountable for tasks where, per ground truth, Accountability belongs to Operations Manager, and Responsibility is typically with Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison.
   - “KYC Review” incorrectly has "Regulatory Liaison" as both Responsible and Accountable, whereas ground truth splits Accountability.

5. **Vocabulary Adherence:**  
   - The answer follows the mandated synonyms well (no forbidden terms), and uses "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst" as required.

6. **Formatting and Structure:**  
   - Table structure is sound, but tasks do not always use exact mandated terminology as in ground truth (e.g., "Receive transfer instruction and log it" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction").

Due to the major omissions (missing a whole role, missing IT Support, wrong Accountabilities, incorrect assignment of Responsible/Consulted), **the answer diverges quite fundamentally from the ground truth**. Even though strict vocabulary rules were generally followed, the structural and role/RACI inaccuracies are serious errors. 

Therefore, a **score of 3.5** reflects heavy, but not absolute, non-compliance (since vocab is correct and core process steps are reflected, albeit misassigned).
