### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer attempts a RACI table in Markdown format and correctly incorporates the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions. It covers the core tasks from the source text and includes a legend. However, under strict evaluation criteria, it has significant deviations from the ground truth, warranting a substantial point deduction:

- **Role Coverage (Major Error, -3.0 points)**: The ground truth includes four roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support), mapping directly to source elements (clerk → Analyst; compliance officer → Liaison; implicit oversight → Operations Manager; explicit IT Support). The LLM omits Operations Manager and IT Support entirely, limiting to only two columns. This fails to "cover every task" from the source (e.g., IT Support's explicit roles in sending SWIFT and archiving are wrongly reassigned to Transaction Analyst, ignoring source attribution).

- **Task Mapping and Wording (Moderate Error, -1.5 points)**: The LLM splits/expands the source's 6 steps into 8 tasks, adding an unsubstantiated row (#8: "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archival") not present in the source or ground truth. Task phrasings deviate (e.g., "Receive transfer instruction and log it" vs. ground truth's standardized "Receive Payment Instruction"; separate "Send SWIFT message" and "Archive case file" vs. ground truth's consolidated "Archive Record"). The ground truth precisely maps and condenses the source without additions or inventions, using mandated wording where required (e.g., bolded "**KYC Review**").

- **RACI Assignments (Major Error, -1.0 points)**: Assignments rarely align exactly:
  - Receive: LLM (R/A Analyst) vs. GT (R Analyst, A Operations) – misses accountability.
  - Screen: Partial match (R Analyst, but A on Liaison in GT vs. Analyst in LLM; misses I Operations, C IT).
  - KYC Review: Close (C Analyst, R/A Liaison) but GT shifts A to Operations and adds I IT.
  - Approve: Mismatch (I Analyst vs. C Analyst; A on Liaison vs. Operations).
  - Release: Mismatch (R/A Analyst, C Liaison) vs. GT (R Analyst, A Operations, I Liaison, C IT).
  - Additional LLM tasks (#6-8) have no GT equivalents and incorrect assignments (e.g., SWIFT sending and archiving to Analyst R/A, ignoring IT Support's source role).
  This results in incomplete/inaccurate responsibility distribution, violating the need to reflect source roles precisely.

Overall, while the structure is present and vocabulary is adhered to (partial credit), the omissions, additions, and mismatches make it unreliable as documentation, far from the ground truth's fidelity to the source. Small inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent dashes "–" vs. blanks) further deduct minor points for polish.
