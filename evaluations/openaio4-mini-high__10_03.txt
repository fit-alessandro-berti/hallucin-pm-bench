### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms, but it violates the core instruction to "not rename, merge, or add activities" by introducing five extraneous rows ("Escalate for Compliance Officer approval", "Once approval is granted", "Schedule the payment", "Release the funds", "Notify the originating analyst"). This fragments the process narrative improperly, whereas the ground truth consolidates into six precise rows covering all described activities without excess.

RACI assignments are largely inaccurate and incomplete:
- No use of "C" (Consulted) anywhere, despite ground truth requiring it (e.g., Compliance Analyst as C for Intake Vetting; Compliance Officer as C for KYC Review and AML Screening; Front-Office Analyst as C for Risk Scoring; Compliance Analyst and Officer as C for Release Funds). This omits a key RACI element.
- Incorrect accountabilities, e.g., Compliance Analyst as A for Risk Scoring (ground truth assigns A to Compliance Officer); Front-Office Analyst as A for Intake Vetting (plausible but paired with wrong secondary roles).
- Overuse of "I" (Informed) in place of "–" (no involvement), e.g., Compliance Officer as I for Intake Vetting (should be –); Front-Office Analyst as I for KYC Review and AML Screening (should be –).
- Splits logical activities (e.g., separate "Escalate" under Compliance Analyst and "Once approval" under Officer, ignoring the conditional escalation path; separate "Schedule" and "Release" instead of merging into "Release Funds").

Additional flaws include:
- Unnecessary "Legend" section, not present in ground truth or requested.
- No bold formatting for activities or R,A cells, reducing clarity (ground truth uses it for emphasis).
- Fails to fully "cover every activity" without addition, as the extra rows redundantly interpret the narrative (e.g., "Notify" is implied in release but not a distinct activity warranting a row).

These are major structural, content, and interpretive errors, not minor—resulting in a matrix that misrepresents the process governance. Partial credit for the correct four core activities and Markdown format prevents a 1.0 score.
