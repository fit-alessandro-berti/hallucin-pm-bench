4.0

**Errors and rationale:**

1. **Vocabulary Policy Violations:**  
   - The LLM answer creates several unauthorized activity names:  
     - “Escalate for Compliance Officer approval” (Not an authorized activity name; should be “Compliance Officer Approval”).  
     - “Once approval is granted” (Not an activity in the narrative or allowed vocab; ambiguous and invented).
     - “Schedule the payment” and “Notify the originating analyst” are not explicitly activities with authorized names (the Ground Truth only lists “Release Funds” for post-approval payment activities).

2. **Missing and Extra Activities:**  
   - The Ground Truth contains exactly six activities (all matched to strict vocab):  
     - “Intake Vetting”
     - “KYC Review”
     - “AML Screening”
     - “Risk Scoring”
     - “Compliance Officer Approval”
     - “Release Funds”  
   - The LLM answer invents or splits activities not listed in the process narrative and omits the correct mapping for "Compliance Officer Approval" and “Release Funds”.

3. **Role Mapping Inaccuracies:**  
   - “Risk Scoring” in the LLM answer gives both R and A to Compliance Analyst, but in the Ground Truth, R is split (Compliance Analyst is R, Compliance Officer is A), and Front-Office Analyst is Consulted.
   - “Compliance Officer Approval” is broken into two incorrect/ambiguous rows (“Escalate for Compliance Officer approval” and “Once approval is granted”).
   - “Release Funds” should be one row with R, A for Treasury Ops and two Consulted (Compliance Analyst, Compliance Officer) and one Informed (Front-Office Analyst). The LLM answer splits this into three separate activities and distributes responsibilities incorrectly.

4. **Formatting (Less Severe But Still Notable):**  
   - The LLM answer provides a Legend but uses it in a place where dash (–) is required by the instructions (see roles not involved).
   - The table headings and activity names do not adhere strictly to the Ground Truth's naming and sequencing.

5. **Strictness:**  
   - The instructions require significant loss down to minor slip-ups. Here, there are major departures: unauthorized activities, breakdowns of steps, missing required C and I role markers, and general misalignment with the Ground Truth.

**Hence, a 4.0 is the highest possible score on this answer for partial adherence to activity-role mapping and strict vocabulary in activity names (though some invented activities breach this), but major errors in structure and compliance with the described process.**
