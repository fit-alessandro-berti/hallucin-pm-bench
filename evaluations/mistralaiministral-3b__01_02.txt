The LLM answer incorrectly interprets "decision points" as the entire sequential process flow (listing all 9 steps), rather than strictly identifying only the branching/decision-making gates as in the ground truth (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval). This is a fundamental mismatch, introducing extraneous non-decision steps and diluting focus, warranting a major deduction. For required documents, the list is complete and uses correct terminology, but minor phrasing variations (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "CIS template" vs. "CIS") and omission of the ground truth's clarifying note on excluded documents result in small but notable inaccuracies under strict evaluation. Overall structure and adherence to terminology are partially correct, but the core content deviation is severe.
