The LLM answer proposes an entirely different modification (changing `Task_SignContract` dueDate to P2D) from the ground truth (changing `Task_CollectEquipment` dueDate to P2D), with a mismatched and verbose rationale that incorrectly references `Grant System Access` while failing to address the overall 3-day SLA constraint; the diff is improperly formatted with extraneous lines and file paths, violating the single-hunk requirement, resulting in complete misalignment and zero adherence to the expected solution.
