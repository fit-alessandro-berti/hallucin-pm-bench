The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with appropriate citations to events, matching the ground truth's assessment of those rules. However, it deducts significant points for incompleteness: it fails to systematically evaluate all five rules as the ground truth does, omitting explicit checks and justifications for Rules 1, 4, and 5 (which are satisfied). This partial analysis deviates from the expected comprehensive justification format, treating only violations while implying (but not confirming) compliance elsewhere. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "three intervening events" vs. "distance = 3") are acceptable, but the lack of full coverage under strict evaluation warrants a mid-range score.
