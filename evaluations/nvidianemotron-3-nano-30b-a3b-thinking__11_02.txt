**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high alignment, minimal loss):** Identical three activities correctly identified (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment) as worst based on table standouts (wait times 150/30/18 min; rework 22%/5.3%/1.8%; SLA breaches 5.5%/12.4%/3.2%; throughput drops/context). Explanations strictly table-based, citing exact metrics without hallucination or absent activities. Concise memo format (<200 words, ~150 estimated). Concrete, data-driven recs per activity, tied to specific issues/metrics (e.g., LLM's quantified targets like "≤18 min" derived from 25 min/~30%). Logical projections present in both.
- **Differences/Deductions (strict, significant for variances):** 
  - Order reversed for #1-2 (LLM: Review first via highest SLA 12.4%; ground truth: Request first via throughput drop to 190 + wait/rework) – defensible but divergent prioritization (-0.4).
  - Recs substantively different (e.g., LLM: portal/checklist/shift vs. ground truth: digital requests/AI/triage) despite both data-tied/concrete (-0.2).
  - Structure diverges (LLM table + list vs. ground truth paragraphs) (-0.1).
  - Minor phrasing extrapolations equal ("inflates cycle time" vs. "feeding congestion"; "peers range" derived but accurate) – no major loss.
  - Projections vary (LLM: -4 pp SLA; ground truth: +10% throughput/-40% SLA) – speculative but similar intent (-0.1).

No factual errors, guessing, or violations; excellent fulfillment but non-identical to ground truth warrants deduction under strict criteria.
