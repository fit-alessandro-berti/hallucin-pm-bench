7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely follows the required format, with all statuses and justifications under 20 words, and the overall result matching the ground truth. It correctly identifies statuses for R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6, including accurate justifications (minor incompleteness in R5 by omitting "Pay_Invoice" does not drastically alter meaning). However, under strict evaluation criteria, the major error in R2—incorrectly deeming it "Compliant" by ignoring the Change_Request's impact on requiring a new approval (thus miscalculating the "last required approval" as 03-04 instead of 03-07, violating the 2-day expedited shipping rule)—represents a critical analytical flaw, warranting a significant deduction from a potential perfect score. This oversight misses a key interaction between rules, reducing accuracy by approximately 25% (one out of six rules fully wrong). Small alignment issues in phrasing (e.g., R1's extra detail) cause negligible further loss. Overall, the response is strong but not flawless, justifying 7.5.
