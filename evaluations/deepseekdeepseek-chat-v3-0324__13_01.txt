**Evaluation:**

1. The LLM answer states: “1 (occurs only once in case A1002)”. This directly matches the ground truth: `1` occurrence. No deduction.

2. The LLM calculates: “5.56%”; shows the work ($1 ÷ 18 × 100$). Matches ground truth in calculation and rounded value. No deduction.

3. The case identifier answer: “A1002”. This matches both format and content of the ground truth (“Only case A1002 contains...”). No deduction.

4. The model answers:
   1. “Small Sample Size: The fragment only contains 18 events from a single day (May 1, 2025), which is insufficient to generalize for an entire month.”
   2. “Time-Bias: The data does not account for seasonal variations, weekdays vs. weekends, or anomalies (e.g., fraud checks may spike during holidays or promotions).”
   
   - The first point aligns directly with “Small sample size” from the ground truth.
   - The second point partially matches “Temporal bias” but is slightly less precise: it mentions “seasonal variations, weekdays vs weekends, or anomalies” which are logical sources of variation, but it does not specify that only a few hours are covered (i.e., “morning of 1 May 2025”)—a slight lack of precision/strictness compared to the model’s guideline, and uses “seasonal” which, strictly, is not inferable from this one-day fragment.

**Strictness note:**
- The only minor deviation is in point 4.2: The model lists possible sources of variation (e.g. “seasonal”) which, strictly, are not established properties of this fragment, violating the instruction to not infer more than what is visible—because nothing is known about fraud rates in holiday seasons or weekends in this data. 
- Furthermore, the ground truth answer lists options like “case-mix bias” and “survivorship/truncation bias,” which are deeper than what the LLM offered.

**Conclusion:**  
All factual answers match 1:1.  
For the sampling-bias question, the answers are correct in essence but include *marginal inference* (“seasonal variations, holidays”) not strictly justified. This is a minor yet real deviation under the given strict rubric.

**Strict deduction:** -0.5 for possible overreach (“seasonal,” “holidays”), and -0.3 for not mentioning the fine detail (“the snippet is only a few hours; later days might differ”), and absence of alternative biases.

**Final:** 9.2
