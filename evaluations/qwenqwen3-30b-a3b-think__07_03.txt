The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact IDs, names, and gateway type shifts matching the ground truth content. No extraneous commentary or unchanged elements are included, adhering to the prompt's restrictions. Minor deductions for formatting differences: absence of bullet points (-) on list items (present in ground truth for all sections) and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway line (e.g., no spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" to match "exclusive â†’ parallel"). These small presentation variances, while not altering meaning, warrant a strict but limited point reduction given the otherwise verbatim compliance.
