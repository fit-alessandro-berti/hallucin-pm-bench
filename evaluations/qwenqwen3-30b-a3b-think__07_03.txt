- The LLM answer omits the leading dashes (“- ”) before list items, which are present in the ground truth and were part of the required format.  
- The required indentation and spacing is not preserved: the LLM answer places each item immediately below the heading with no blank lines, while the ground truth answer visually separates the sections for clarity.
- It inconsistently applies the required output formatting for the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section: the ground truth uses indentation and aligns the colons, while the LLM presents the changes compactly and without alignment.
- These formatting discrepancies, though seemingly minor, contravene the instruction to follow the three headings “verbatim and in this order,” and to output "only the three required headings and the concrete differences."

Content-wise, the differences detected are correct and complete, but the format strictness deserved a significant penalty.
