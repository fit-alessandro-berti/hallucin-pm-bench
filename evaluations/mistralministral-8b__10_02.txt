3.0

**Evaluation:**

- **Severe Issues and Errors:**  
  1. **Completely omits “Operations Manager”** as a role, while the ground truth includes it as the Accountable party for all steps.
  2. **RACI assignments are incorrect:** Responsible and Accountable roles are misapplied (eg, Regulatory Liaison is set as both Responsible and Accountable for KYC Review and high-risk approval; in the ground truth, Responsible is Regulatory Liaison, Accountable is Operations Manager).
  3. **Tasks are reworded and not precisely mapped to the mandated wording** in the Activity column. For instance, “Log the transfer instruction in the system” is not required as a separate line item in the ground truth.
  4. **Includes an unnecessary “Notify the compliance officer” step.** This is not a process task from the mandated vocabulary; it refers back to the original terminology.
  5. **Consistency:** The table layout is not as professional or clear as the ground truth (eg, missing the legend, empty Consulted and Informed columns in many cases).
  6. **Did not use only the exact mandated vocabulary for ALL task/activity wording.** For some steps, it still echoes language like “transfer instruction” instead of “Receive Payment Instruction” or “Screen Against Sanctions List,” against explicit instructions.
  7. **Consulted and Informed columns are mostly empty, showing poor understanding of stakeholder involvement, unlike the ground truth.**
  8. **Assigns Accountable for everything to Regulatory Liaison, which is not in line with segregation of duties or best RACI practice.**

**Why not lower than 3.0?**  
The answer shows a clear attempt to use the enforced vocabulary for roles most of the time, and it tries to cover the main process steps. However, the multitude of process mapping errors, missing columns, misapplied responsibility, and inaccurate mapping to instructions demonstrate a critical misunderstanding of the task.

**Summary:**  
The answer fundamentally misapplies RACI logic and misses central requirements, but does show minimal surface-level effort in using some mandated language and identifying major process steps, so it is not entirely unusable. **Score: 3.0**.
