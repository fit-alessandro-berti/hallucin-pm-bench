### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, content, completeness, and adherence to the prompt's mandates, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Key differences and point deductions:

- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Major Loss: -4.0 points)**: The LLM breaks down the source into 9 granular tasks (e.g., separate "Receive" and "Log"; separate "Release" and "SWIFT"; adds "Notify the compliance officer"), but omits or poorly maps elements like the combined receive/log in the source. Ground truth consolidates into 6 precise tasks (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" covers step 1 without splitting; no separate log or notify; "Release Payment" implicitly includes SWIFT). LLM adds unsubstantiated splits and a notify task, while failing to match ground truth's exact phrasing and coverage of "every step without omissions."

- **Vocabulary Mandate Adherence (Major Loss: -2.0 points)**: LLM correctly uses "KYC Review" and mostly "Regulatory Liaison"/"Transaction Analyst," but violates strictly by using "Notify the compliance officer" (non-mandated term; should be "Regulatory Liaison"). Ground truth enforces this perfectly (e.g., "**KYC Review**" bolded, no forbidden terms). Small errors like this demand significant deduction.

- **Roles and RACI Assignments (Major Loss: -2.0 points)**: LLM uses only "Transaction Analyst," "Regulatory Liaison," and "IT Support" (no "Operations Manager"), leading to incomplete columns. RACI assignments (e.g., LLM's Transaction Analyst as R/A for screening; Regulatory Liaison as sole R/A for approval) do not match ground truth's (e.g., Regulatory Liaison as R for KYC/Approve with Operations Manager as A; IT Support as R only for Archive). Headers use full words ("Responsible") vs. ground truth's letter-based cells with a legendâ€”complete mismatch.

- **Table Structure and Formatting (Minor Loss: -0.5 points)**: Markdown table is present, but lacks ground truth's exact layout (e.g., no "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header; no bolding; no legend; empty cells instead of letters like "I" or "C"). Extra explanatory text ("This table clearly defines...") is absent in ground truth.

- **Overall Fidelity and Additions (Minor Loss: -0.5 points)**: LLM introduces unsubstantiated Consulted role (e.g., Transaction Analyst for SWIFT) and ignores ground truth's notes on mapping/enforcement. No omissions in ground truth are replicated accurately.

The LLM captures some mandated terms and attempts a RACI table but fails to align with the ground truth's consolidated tasks, role set, and precise enforcement, resulting in a score far from maximum. Even partial matches (e.g., core roles) do not offset the pervasive differences.
