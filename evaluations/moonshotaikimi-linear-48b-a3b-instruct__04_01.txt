### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Overall Compliance Conclusion**: Correct (Non-compliant), earning partial credit.
- **Rule 1**: LLM claims satisfied but bundles it with Rule 2 without specific explanation; ground truth provides detailed verification. Minor deduction for lack of detail.
- **Rule 2**: Major error—LLM incorrectly states satisfied, ignoring the clear violation (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods). This is a critical miss, as it's one of the two actual violations, warranting significant point loss.
- **Rule 3**: Correctly identifies violation, but phrasing is inaccurate and confusing (references Ship_Goods distance incorrectly; ground truth clearly defines distance from Goods_Received as 3). Partial credit.
- **Rule 4**: Major error—LLM falsely claims violation by misidentifying direct succession (events 4-6 intervene between CFO at #3 and Intern at #7). This invents a non-issue, directly contradicting ground truth.
- **Rule 5**: Not addressed at all, despite being satisfied in ground truth. Omission deducts points for incompleteness.
- **Structure and Comprehensiveness**: LLM's justification is brief and only covers 3 rules partially, with errors; ground truth systematically evaluates all 5. Strict evaluation penalizes inaccuracies and gaps heavily, resulting in a low score despite correct top-level answer.
