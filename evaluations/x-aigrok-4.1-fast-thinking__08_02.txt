The LLM answer is factually correct (Yes, same minimal sequence T1-T2-T7-T4-T5, proper explanation of markings enabling T5 pre-T3). It concisely demonstrates the point within limits. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking explicit intermediate markings (M₁-M₅) as in ground truth, reducing verifiability; (2) prose summary vs. numbered list with markings; (3) "T3 never fires" phrasing slightly less precise than "T3 has not yet occurred" + disabling detail; (4) minor formatting variance (bold brackets vs. numbered steps). No logical errors, but strict matching requires fuller alignment.
