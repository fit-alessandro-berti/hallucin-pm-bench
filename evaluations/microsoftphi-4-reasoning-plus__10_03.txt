2.0

The LLM answer does not provide a RACI matrix as required by the prompt. Instead, it delivers an extremely lengthy, discursive walkthrough of its own reasoning process and struggles to parse both the vocabulary policy and the process narrative. At no point does it output a Markdown table, nor does it assign RACI roles to each activity and role. Thus, it fails on the core deliverable of generating the matrix.

**Major errors contributing to the low score:**
- **No Markdown table appears at all.**
- **No actual RACI assignments for activities and roles.**
- **No listing of the mandated four activity names (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”).**
- **No compliance with the vocabulary policy in output (since there is no output containing the activity names at all).**
- **No structured, interpretable answer resembling the ground truth.**

**Minor positives:**
- The LLM does reason through the vocabulary policy extensively, but this is only preparatory and not the explicit output required.
- There is no output of any banned synonym (but only because there is effectively no output at all).

**Conclusion:**  
While the LLM demonstrates some understanding in its internal monologue, it does not fulfill the main requirement—to output the RACI matrix covering every activity and role as specified in the ground truth. Even though the LLM avoids explicit vocabulary policy errors (by not actually yielding any final table output), the lack of the required table and RACI assignments means this answer is almost a complete miss per strict grading standards. Thus, a grade of **2.0** is appropriate.
