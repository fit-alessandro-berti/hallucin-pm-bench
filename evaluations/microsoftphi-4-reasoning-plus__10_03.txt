1.0

The LLM answer fails entirely to produce the required Markdown RACI matrix, instead delivering an excessively long, unresolved internal reasoning process that debates ambiguities, conditionally branches, and potential row additions/merges without ever outputting a table. This violates core instructions to "produce a RACI matrix... Return the matrix as a Markdown table; do not rename, merge, or add activities." No authorized vocabulary is used in an output context, as there is no matrix. Disallowed synonyms (e.g., “Preliminary Assessment”, “Customer Due Diligence (CDD)”, “Sanctions Check”, “risk rating”) appear repeatedly in the reasoning, breaching the strict vocabulary policy. The ground truth has 6 precise rows with exact RACI assignments; the LLM has zero rows and no assignments. This is a complete non-fulfillment, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
