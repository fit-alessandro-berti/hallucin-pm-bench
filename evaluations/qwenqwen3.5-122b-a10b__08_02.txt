9.2

The LLM answer is factually correct (Yes for Q1, identical minimal sequence for Q2 demonstrating T5 before T3), concise (under 120 words), and logically sound (correctly identifies enabling marking {P2, P5}, competition for P2 token). However, strict evaluation deducts for:
- Lack of explicit Q1/Q2 labeling.
- No full intermediate markings (GT lists M₁–M₅; LLM only one).
- Integrated explanation vs. GT's separated structure.
- Minor wording variances (e.g., "parallel path" vs. GT's "alternative path including T1").

Semantically equivalent but not identical in detail/format (significant per strictness).
