6.5

- The LLM answer lists all required differences but does NOT prefix the entries with dashes ("-") as in the ground truth.
- The format for each entry is not strictly as the ground truth: for example, tasks are written as `Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)` instead of `- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)`.
- The answer omits the required spacing and indentation, as well as the alignment of colons seen in the ground truth's GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section.
- The content regarding the differences is correct, but the deviations from the exact required output format, including the lack of bullets and alignment, result in a significant penalty under strict assessment.
