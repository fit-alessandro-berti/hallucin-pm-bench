The LLM answer captures all functional changes accurately in terms of content (added/removed tasks and gateway changes match exactly), with correct IDs, names, and format for each item per the prompt's specifications (e.g., "id (name)" for tasks and "id: old â†’ new" for gateways). Headings are verbatim and in order, with no extraneous commentary. However, it lacks the bullet points ("-") used in the ground truth for list items, which introduces minor formatting inconsistencies across all sections (e.g., no alignment padding in the second gateway entry). Under strict evaluation, this formatting deviation deducts points despite the perfect semantic match.
