6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major issues, ~60% alignment)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision with accurate branching logic (e.g., ≤2 point difference, <€15,000 auto-approval vs. ≥€15,000 escalation), using exact terminology. However, it omits the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as a distinct decision point, instead embedding its description ("board votes either to approve or reject") within the Amount Threshold bullet. This results in only two listed points vs. the ground truth's three explicit, numbered ones. It also lacks contextual flow details (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), making the summary less comprehensive and precise. Strict deduction for incompleteness and structural mismatch.
  
- **Required Documents (minor issues, ~85% alignment)**: The list is complete and uses exact names from the prompt, with no introductions of standard terminology. However, small phrasing differences from ground truth incur losses: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)"; "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" (omits "single" and "or"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (extra "template"). The LLM uses bullets and keeps more original wording (e.g., "old", "single...or"), while ground truth shortens and omits the explanatory note ("No credit bureau report..."). No major errors, but strict policy requires significant deduction for any variance.

Overall score reflects high fidelity but penalizes omissions and phrasing inconsistencies strictly, as instructed.
