The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, `gw_valid` type change from exclusive to inclusive), uses exact element IDs from the XML, structures under the required headings, and avoids speculation or extras. However, under utmost strictness:
- List format differs (- bullets vs *; no full task names or `(id = ``id`)` format).
- Gateway phrasing differs (concise `gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway` vs descriptive with **bold**, backticks, (v1)/(v2)).
- Misses GT's extra note (minor, as not required).
These presentation/content differences from GT deduct 2 points despite factual accuracy.
