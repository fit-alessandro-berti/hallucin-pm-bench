The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (answering "Yes"), provides a valid, concrete firing sequence demonstrating T5 firing before T3 (T1 → T2 → T5), and offers a brief justification tied to the inhibitor arc condition (p3=1, p4=0). The sequence markings are accurate and reachable from the initial state. However, it differs from the ground truth in being more concise: it omits extending the sequence to fire T3 afterward, does not emphasize that T5 "must" precede T3 for T5 to ever fire, and provides less detailed justification about T3 permanently disabling T5 via the inhibitor arc. These omissions represent minor differences in completeness and depth, warranting a small deduction under strict evaluation, though no factual errors exist.
