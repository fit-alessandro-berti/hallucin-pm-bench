The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides an accurate, concise justification citing the key counterexample in C003 (lines 6-7), which alone disproves the "always" claim. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for omitting the second clear counterexample in C005 (line 11, Validate_Payment without any Receive_Order), which the ground truth explicitly includes as additional proof. This omission represents a meaningful difference in completeness (half the counterexamples missed), different phrasing/structure (single sentence vs. bulleted list), and slightly less comprehensive evidence, warranting a significant but not devastating deduction from perfection. No factual errors or deviations from the log.
