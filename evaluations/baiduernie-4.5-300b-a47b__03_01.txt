### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core process flow accurately, including the start event, auto-classification, password reset path, diagnosis decision, resolve/forward logic, specialist routing to resolve, confirmation step, rework loop back to diagnosis, and end event—aligning with the description's 10 lines without inventing unmentioned elements (e.g., no timers, escalations, or extra activities). The rework loop is modeled exactly as specified (back to "Initial Diagnosis" on non-confirmation). It uses exclusive gateways for the three necessary decisions (despite the prompt mentioning only "two," which both the LLM and ground truth ignore in practice) and stays under 40 lines for the XML block.

However, under utmost strictness, multiple small-but-significant differences from the ground truth result in a substantial deduction:
- **Output format violations**: Includes extraneous Markdown (````xml`), explanatory "Key features" list (6 lines), and introductory text, violating "Output a single `<definitions> … </definitions>` block." This alone warrants a major penalty for not delivering *exactly* the requested isolated XML.
- **Missing XML structure**: Lacks `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` declaration and `targetNamespace` attribute, which are present in the ground truth.
- **Process element mismatches**: `id="supportTicketProcess"` (vs. "support_ticket"); missing `name="Support-Ticket"` and `isExecutable="false"`.
- **Element ID and naming inconsistencies** (small errors, but cumulative loss):
  - Start event: `id="t1"` (vs. "start").
  - Classification task: `name="Classify Ticket"` (vs. "Auto-Classification," which better reflects "automatically classified by the system").
  - Second gateway: `name="Issue Resolved?"` (vs. "Resolved Internally?").
  - Third gateway: `name="Confirmed?"` (vs. "Customer Confirms?").
  - End event: `id="t8"` (vs. "end").
  - Uses t1–t8/gw1–gw3 (concise, but not matching ground truth's "start"/"end"/t1–t6/gw1–gw3).
- **Sequence flow differences**: No `id` attributes (e.g., "f1"–"f13" in ground truth). Includes `name="Yes"`/`"No"` on flows (unnecessary and absent in ground truth). Condition expressions use non-standard `${variable}` FEEL-like syntax without `xsi:type="tFormalExpression"` or simple "yes"/"no" text (ground truth uses the latter for conciseness and standard BPMN compliance).
- **No unmentioned additions**: Correctly avoided hallucinations (e.g., no parallel paths, approvals, or timers), and the password reset path correctly skips resolve/forward to go straight to confirmation.

These ~12 differences (mostly formatting/naming) indicate incomplete fidelity to the ground truth's exact structure and BPMN conventions, despite functional equivalence. A perfect match would require zero deviations; here, the extras and omissions compound to prevent a higher score. If strictness emphasized logic over minutiae, it could reach 8.0+, but per instructions, even small errors incur significant loss.
