### Evaluation Rationale
**Question 1**: Perfect match—exact count of 1, with correct case and timestamp reference. No deductions.

**Question 2**: Strong overall coverage of small sample unreliability (volume, potential for skewed rates) and naming variations, staying within ~110 words and data-driven. However, strict deductions for deviations: 
- Emphasizes case-level prevalence (33%) vs. ground truth's event-level (0-7% swing, confidence intervals, rare-event sampling error quantification)—a key statistical nuance missed, treating it more qualitatively.
- Adds unemphasized elements (temporal clustering, edge-case selection) not central to ground truth's focus on sampling volatility and fuzzy matching risks, introducing minor extraneous reasoning.
- Lacks ground truth's precision on error magnitude (e.g., "one extra or missing line" impact) and call for "randomly drawn slice," diluting exact alignment.

Total reflects high fidelity but penalizes content/emphasis differences per strict criteria.
