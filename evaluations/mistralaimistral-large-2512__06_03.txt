The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt. However, under utmost strictness:  
- Extra introductory sentence restating the process name and prompt phrasing (not in ground truth).  
- Different set headers ("First Parallel Split (#1)" vs. "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), altering wording despite referencing the source accurately.  
- Bullet-point listing with backticks vs. inline `task` ‖ `task` format.  
- Missing explicit closing statement "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel."  
These are multiple presentational differences from the ground truth, warranting deductions despite functional equivalence.
