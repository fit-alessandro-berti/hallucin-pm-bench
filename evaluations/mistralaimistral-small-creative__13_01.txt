**9.8**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1**: Correct count (1), but "1 time" ≠ exact "1 occurrence" phrasing. Minor wording deviation (-0.1).
- **Q2**: Exact calculation and rounding (5.56%). Formatting minor diff ("% " vs "%", "≈" vs "="). Negligible, but strictness notes it (-0.1 total across calcs).
- **Q3**: Correct list ("A1002"), implies only one. Ground truth adds "Only case...contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”" for emphasis/repetition. Concise list matches "List" instruction perfectly; no deduction.
- **Q4**: Both reasons sampling-related and match ground truth options ("Small sample size" exact; "Lack of temporal representativeness" = "Temporal bias"). Elaborations (hours/day, general variation examples like holidays/weekends) derive from log timestamps + standard sampling logic, no hallucinated events. Specifics align (short window, variation risks); no unjustified inference. Full credit.
- **Overall**: No factual errors, hallucinations, or inferences beyond log. Structured response adheres to "answer every question" + exclusivity. Tiny phrasing/formatting diffs prevent perfect 10.0 under utmost strictness (significant loss for small errors).
