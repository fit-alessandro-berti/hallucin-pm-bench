**9.5**

The LLM answer fully satisfies core requirements: correct top-3 activities ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120.0 h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44.0 h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4 h), verbatim quotes of both metrics, no extraneous content (e.g., no service times or other activities), under 150 words (~120), and three concrete, relevant actions each promising ≥20% reduction with data-driven rationale (benchmarks/projections, akin to GT's pilots/estimates).  

Minor deductions (-0.5): stylistic/format differences (full memo headers vs. GT's plain list; slight action rephrasing, e.g., "multi-channel reminders" vs. GT's "customer reminders with escalation"; #3 load-balancing vs. GT's pre-classification); extra closing recommendation (not in GT but non-violating). No factual errors; highly aligned in substance.
