The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant and accurately pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with appropriate citations and explanations matching the ground truth. It also briefly confirms satisfaction of the remaining rules (1, 4, and 5), though in a summarized bullet format rather than the ground truth's fully numbered per-rule structure. Minor deduction for this structural deviation and slightly imprecise phrasing on Rule 3's distance ("three activities after" aligns with the ground truth's "distance = 3" but could be clearer on intervening steps). No factual errors or omissions affect the core assessment.
