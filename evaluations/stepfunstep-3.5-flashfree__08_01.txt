The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (matching "Yes"), provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 fires when T3 has not (core match), and offers a brief, accurate justification focused on the enabling condition (p3=1, p4=0 via inhibitor arc). This suffices for the prompt's requirements.

**Significant deductions (-0.8 total):**  
- Lacks the ground truth's stronger claim ("must fire before T3 if it ever occurs") and deeper proof (permanence of T5 disablement post-T3; p4 never emptied without p3).  
- Sequence is shorter (stops at T5, does not explicitly fire T3 afterward for clearer ordering demonstration).  
- Misses per-step markings (e.g., `p1=1, p2=1`) and full inhibitor explanation.  
No factual errors (unlike ground truth's invalid T4 firing post-T5, as p3=0 prevents it), but strict difference-matching penalizes incompleteness relative to ground truth.
