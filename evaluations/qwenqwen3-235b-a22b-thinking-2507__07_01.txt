The LLM answer correctly identifies the added tasks (by ID), the removed task (by ID), and the gateway type change, with no extraneous information or speculation, aligning with the prompt's focus on factual XML differences. However, it deviates significantly from the ground truth by listing tasks solely using IDs (e.g., "check_vip") instead of the exact element names from the XML's `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status"), which the prompt requires ("Use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML") and the ground truth exemplifies. This omission of names is a clear, substantive error across all task listings, warranting a major deduction under strict evaluation criteria. Minor differences include less descriptive phrasing for the gateway change (lacking explicit v1/v2 references) and simpler formatting (plain lists vs. bulleted with emphasis), but these are secondary to the task naming issue.
