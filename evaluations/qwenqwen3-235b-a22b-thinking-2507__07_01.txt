7.5

The LLM answer matches the actual facts in terms of substance:

- Both added tasks ("check_vip", "generate_qr") are named, though only by id, not by the name attribute as in the ground truth.
- Removed task is correct by id but omits the task name and does not present the id in parentheses as per ground truth.
- Gateway type change is correct, but does not follow the full format (mentioning the id and value change, but not bolding, nor using the "changed from X to Y" phrasing).

Main issues:

- The element names are provided as ids only, not full descriptive names + ids as shown in ground truth (see instructions: “Use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML”, but ground truth uses both name and id, so the strictest interpretation would require both).
- Answer does not use bolding as in the ground truth (minor formatting, but markdown style is not requested directly, so minor).
- "send_rma_label" is listed under "Removed tasks" as only the id, whereas ground truth includes both the name and id. Same for added tasks.
- Wording for the gateway change is less informative.

As per the instruction to "evaluate with the utmost strictness" and for "also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points", these formatting and completeness differences (especially omitting the name= attribute, which is explicit in the XML and in the ground truth) should cost multiple points.

Therefore, 7.5 is an appropriate (strict) score: factually complete, but not strictly following name+id presentation, markdown, or most-explanatory wording.
