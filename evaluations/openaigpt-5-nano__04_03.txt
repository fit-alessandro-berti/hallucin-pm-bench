The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") due to the Rule 3 violation, with accurate assessments for all rules matching the ground truth in substance. Justifications reference the rules appropriately, including sequence and positioning details that align with the trace. Minor deductions for format differences (bullet list vs. table, lack of explicit summary sentence on overall non-compliance) and slightly more verbose phrasing in places, but no factual errors or omissions.
