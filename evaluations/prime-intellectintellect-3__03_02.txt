**2.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure (full BPMN "definitions/process/flowElement" with mixed elements/flows and messages vs. simple "process_id/elements/flows"), element IDs/names (e.g., "task1" vs. "createTicket"; "Support Email Received" vs. "Email Received"; missing names on gateways), modeling choices (no parallel join vs. explicit "joinAfterLogging"; ReceiveTask + boundary timer vs. eventBasedGateway + intermediate catches; wrong sequential cancel after "task1" with invalid multi-out seq flows vs. unconnected cancel), missing elements (no "eventBasedGateway", "timer24h" as intCatch, explicit join), incorrect BPMN details (e.g., "type" vs. standard "$type"; wrong "conditionExpression" structure; "terminateAll" on EndEvent; unconnected logSolution token path ok but mismatched), extra/missing flows (16 flows with errors like flow14 split vs. 19 precise flows), and faithful deviations (includes "Parse" vs. GT omission). Strict evaluation: cumulative differences justify minimal score despite partial logical alignment to text.
