**7.2**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility due to missing data (only column headers, no timestamps or rows), references the event log stub appropriately, and addresses the core issue for all metrics (average cycle time, std dev, 95% CI). It stays in plain text, one short paragraph, and avoids guessing/external knowledge, aligning with the task. However, under utmost strictness:
- Abrupt truncation ("or a 9") leaves the response incomplete, failing to fully articulate the 95% CI reference.
- Less precise than ground truth: omits explicit mention of "all event rows... redacted," "concrete times for any 'Approve Invoice' execution," "dispersion," and "additional raw log entries required."
- Slightly wordier intro ("we would typically need...") vs. ground truth's direct "Impossible—"; minor rephrasing reduces exactness.
These differences (incompleteness + precision gaps) warrant ~25-30% deduction from 10.0.
