5.0

**Reasoning and Breakdown:**

**Q1:** Correct. "3" matches the three unique cases (C001, C002, C003).  
→ **No penalty.**

**Q2:** Correct. The sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" is exactly as required.  
→ **No penalty.**

**Q3:** **Incorrect.** The answer only lists "Check_Stock", omitting "Arrange_Delivery". According to the XES log fragment, "Arrange_Delivery" also immediately precedes "Ship_Order" (for C002). Furthermore, the instruction to alphabetically order the list is not an issue since only one value is shown, but the major fault is omission.

**Scoring:**  
- Two answers are perfect.
- One answer (Q3) is 50% incomplete (omits one out of two required items).

Given the instruction to strictly penalize even small errors, especially omissions, this is a critical one: the answer would mislead an analyst about the possible process flows, because "Arrange_Delivery" preceding "Ship_Order" is ignored.

**Final score:**  
Q1 = 0 deductions  
Q2 = 0 deductions  
Q3 = -5 points (omission of half the truth on the most analytical question)

**Total:** 10 - 5 = **5.0**

The heavy penalty follows from the importance and clarity of Q3, and the strict standard requested.
