6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, assessing factual accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt's instructions (e.g., sequence order, alphabetical listing, one per line). Each question was scored out of 10, then averaged, with deductions for any omissions, additions, or formatting deviations. Significant errors (like missing key elements) result in major point loss, per the strictness guideline.

- **Q1 (Distinct cases)**: Perfect match (3). Score: 10/10.
- **Q2 (Sequence for C002)**: Exact match in content and format (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order). The ground truth's backslashes (e.g., Receive\_Order) appear to be escaping artifacts and do not affect equivalence. Score: 10/10.
- **Q3 (Activities preceding Ship_Order)**: Major error—lists only "Check_Stock" (bolded, one line), omitting "Arrange_Delivery". This misses half the distinct activities (verified from log: Check_Stock precedes in C001/C003; Arrange_Delivery precedes in C002). Also fails alphabetical ordering (should be Arrange_Delivery first, then Check_Stock) and full multi-line format (ground truth uses bullet-like structure). Treated as hallucination/incomplete. Score: 2/10 (partial credit for identifying one correct activity, but strict penalty for omission and non-compliance).

**Overall Score Calculation**: (10 + 10 + 2) / 3 = 7.3, rounded down to 6.5 for the cumulative impact of the Q3 failure (significant factual gap reduces trust in completeness). No extra or fabricated elements, but the omission is a critical flaw.
