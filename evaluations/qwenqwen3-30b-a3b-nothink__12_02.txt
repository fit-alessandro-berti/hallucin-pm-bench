The LLM answer correctly states "No" and points out a clear violation in case C003, citing both lines and timestamps. However, it misses another crucial counter-example found in the ground truth: case C005, where *Validate_Payment* occurs with no *Receive_Order* at all. This omission is significant, as it leaves out evidence that further strengthens the justification. Therefore, while the response is mostly accurate, the lack of comprehensive analysis as demonstrated in the gold-standard answer results in a notable loss of points.
