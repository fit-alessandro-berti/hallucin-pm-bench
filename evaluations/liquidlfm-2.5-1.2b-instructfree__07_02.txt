**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks**: LLM lists only 2/3 (misses **Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)); partial credit lost entirely due to incompleteness (-4.0 equivalent impact).
- **Removed tasks**: LLM incorrectly states "None" (misses **Reject Loan** (`Task_RejectLoan`)); full error (-3.0 equivalent).
- **Gateway-type changes**: Mentions "Exclusive-to-inclusive" but immediately contradicts with "no change" and XML snippets; fails to clearly state the change as in ground truth (-1.0 equivalent).
- **Format/strictness**: Extra fluff ("Certainly!", "Let me know..."), inconsistent structure (XML snippets vs. name/ID format), ignores "summarise *all* changes" precisely; violations deduct further (-0.5).
- **Overall**: ~40% accuracy on core items (2/5 correct/partial); strict policy demands near-perfect match, resulting in minimal score. No credit for ignored instructions like "exactly these headings" without extras.
