The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure (full BPMN schema vs. custom simplified JSON with "process_id", "elements", and "flows"), invalid BPMN constructs (boundary events improperly attached to an intermediate catch event, which is not permitted), reference errors (outgoing arcs on boundary events mismatch sequence flow IDs, e.g., all reference "Flow_Cancellation" but flows use distinct IDs like "Flow_Cancellation2"), missing synchronization (no parallel join gateway after logging and sending response, unlike ground truth's "joinAfterLogging"), altered wait modeling (boundary timer on invalid element vs. event-based gateway with separate timer/message catches), over-elaborated cancellation (multiple boundary events on every element vs. single disconnected "cancelEvent"), extra endpoints (separate "EndEvent_Logging" and main end vs. single "end"), and minor name/condition mismatches (e.g., "Email Received" vs. "Support E-mail Received", "simple" vs. "Simple"). These accumulate to substantial differences, including hallucinations of additional elements/flows absent from the key, warranting a low score under strict evaluation.
