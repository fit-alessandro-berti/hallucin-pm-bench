**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can run in parallel (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines; Create_Documentation — Quality_Check), lists them in correct alphabetical order both within pairs and overall, ignores Process A, and uses the specified format with code block and em dashes. 

Minor deductions for:
- Uninstructed introductory text (deviates from "output one pair per line" implying minimal/no preamble).
- Slight spacing misalignment in the second pair ("Procure_Materials  —" vs ground truth's padded "Procure_Materials     —" for alignment).
- Bold **Process B** (extra formatting not in ground truth).
- Absence of the explanatory *Rationale* section present in ground truth.

Under utmost strictness, these format/content mismatches (small but multiple) warrant a 1.0-point deduction from perfect, despite semantically flawless response to the task.
