The LLM answer is functionally identical and fully correct (interrupting boundary timer on the right task with correct 48h duration PT48H, routing to the existing unused AMReview activity, complying with "no new activities"), with proper BPMN XML syntax matching the original namespace/style. Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for: non-identical cosmetic details like event/flow IDs (-0.2), boundary event name and attribute order (-0.2), absence of ground truth's explanatory XML comments (-0.2), and slightly rephrased justification lacking exact wording/bolding/italics/label despite conveying the identical meaning (-0.2). No semantic or correctness errors.
