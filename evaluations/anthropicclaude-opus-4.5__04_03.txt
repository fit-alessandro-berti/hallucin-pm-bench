7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct overall conclusion ("No")**: Matches ground truth (+2.0).
- **Structure and coverage**: Provides a table referencing **all 4 rules** with analysis, similar to ground truth. Short justification as required (+2.0).
- **Rule 2, 3, 4**: Correct assessments and reasoning, precisely matching ground truth (+1.5 each = +4.5).
- **Rule 1**: **Major error** (-3.0). Incorrectly marked as **Violated** despite admitting "QE occurs before RA ✓" and "ordering... technically present." Rule 1 only requires "once each and in that order" (QE before RA), which holds true (no consecutiveness required, extras like NA allowed between). Ground truth correctly marks ✔ Satisfied. Flawed reasoning mixes in Rule 3 prematurely.
- **Minor deductions** (-1.0 total): Slightly verbose/inconsistent self-hedging in Rule 1 ("technically present, but disrupted"); "Primary Violation" section redundant but not harmful.
- **Strictness applied**: Factual misassessment of Rule 1 (core requirement) incurs heavy penalty despite strong alignment elsewhere. Total reflects ~80-85% fidelity to ground truth, downgraded for precision.
