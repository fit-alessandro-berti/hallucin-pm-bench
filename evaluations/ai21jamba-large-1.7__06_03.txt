The LLM answer lists both sets of concurrent tasks correctly, faithfully reflecting the parallel blocks from Process B. The ordering matches the process flow, and there is no extraneous information about Processes A or C.

However, there is a very minor omission of contextual detail compared to the ground truth: the answer lacks explicit reference to the positions of the parallel blocks (e.g., "first parallel block", "second parallel block"), and does not clarify that no other tasks can run in parallel. According to the instruction to be strict and penalize even small omissions, this difference warrants a notable, though not major, reduction in score.
