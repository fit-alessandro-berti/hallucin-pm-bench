The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the proper order, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements for content and focus. However, it loses points for minor formatting discrepancies with the ground truth: (1) using bolded "**Set 1:**" headers with bullet points instead of numbered lists with descriptive labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"; (2) presenting tasks as separate bullets rather than inline with the parallel symbol "‖"; and (3) omitting the ground truth's explicit closing statement about no other parallel tasks (though this is not required by the prompt, its absence creates a difference under strict evaluation). These small presentation errors warrant a deduction, but the core accuracy is excellent.
