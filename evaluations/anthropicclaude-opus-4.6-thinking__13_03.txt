7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1 (40% weight)**: Correct count (1), accurately cites location/confirmation from data (no speculation). However, ground truth is minimally "1"; added details deviate from concise format → deduct 1 pt (9/10).
- **Part 2 (60% weight)**: Strong overlap on tiny sample and label inconsistency. Good ≤120 words (87 words). But: uses case proportion (33%, 1/3) vs. ground truth event proportion (~7%, 1/14) and swing quantification (0%-7%); misses time span (<2 hrs), confidence interval, "rare events sampling error" emphasis; adds speculative "selection bias/cherry-picked" (violates "no speculation"); format/headers differ → multiple small errors, significant deduct (6.5/10).
- **Overall**: Factually sound but not precise match; strictness applied for divergences.
