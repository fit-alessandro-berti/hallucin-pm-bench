The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content, sequence, distinct elements, and ordering:
- Q1/A1: Identical ("3").
- Q2/A2: Identical sequence ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"; backslashes in ground truth are escaping artifacts, not substantive).
- Q3/A3: Identical distinct predecessors ("Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock", alphabetically ordered, one per line). No extras, misses, or hallucinations. Minor formatting (e.g., no dashes) aligns with prompt ("one per line") over ground truth presentation.
