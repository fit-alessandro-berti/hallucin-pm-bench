4.0

- The LLM answer uses the required vocabulary for the four controlled terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) and does not leak synonyms. 
- However, there are major structural and factual problems:
    - The RACI attributions are frequently wrong compared to the ground truth.
    - The LLM invents activities not authorized in the ground truth (e.g., "Escalation for Approval", "Scheduling the Payment", "Notifying the Originating Analyst"). Per the instructions, it must not add, rename, or merge activities.
    - For named activities that do match, most RACI assignments do not align with the ground truth (e.g., missing "C", overused "RA").
    - The LLM fails to combine "R, A" in a single cell (it puts "RA" without a comma and appears to mean both, but the instructions specify "R, A").
    - The "Release Funds" activity is misnamed as "Releasing the Funds."
    - In summary: only the mandated vocabulary is respected; otherwise, the table diverges strongly from both the letter and intent of the instructions.

Given proper vocabulary but severe structural and factual inaccuracies, a strict assessment yields a 4.0.
