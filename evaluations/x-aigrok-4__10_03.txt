### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no disallowed synonyms leaking in. This avoids a complete failure but does not cover the full narrative accurately.
- **Structure and Format**: Markdown table is used, which matches requirements. However, the RACI notations (e.g., "RA" vs. ground truth's "**R, A**") are abbreviated without bolding or commas, introducing minor formatting inconsistencies. Activities and roles are not renamed or merged correctly, but extras are added.
- **Adherence to Instructions (Major Violations)**: The prompt strictly forbids adding activities. The LLM adds five unauthorized ones ("Escalation for Approval", "Compliance Officer Approval", "Scheduling the Payment", "Releasing the Funds", "Notifying the Originating Analyst"), exceeding the ground truth's six derived activities. This alone warrants severe deduction. It also fails to "cover every activity and role" without expansion, fragmenting the narrative (e.g., separate rows for scheduling/release/notify, which ground truth consolidates).
- **Accuracy of RACI Assignments (Significant Errors)**: Even for overlapping activities, assignments diverge substantially, omitting key roles or misassigning R/A/C/I:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Misses C for Compliance Analyst and I for Treasury Ops; no â€“ for Compliance Officer.
  - **KYC Review**: Misses R,A for Compliance Analyst (only R); treats A for Compliance Officer but omits C and I for Treasury Ops.
  - **AML Screening**: Same issues as KYC Review (incomplete for Compliance Analyst, Officer, and Treasury Ops).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Misses C for Front-Office Analyst.
  These omissions and inaccuracies affect nearly every cell, with no alignment on escalation/approval/release (ground truth integrates these differently).
- **Overall Coverage**: The matrix attempts to address the full narrative but inflates scope incorrectly, leading to incomplete fidelity. Ground truth is concise (6 rows, precise derivations like "Release Funds" encompassing scheduling/release/notify), while LLM's 9 rows introduce noise and errors.
- **Strictness Applied**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., missing C/I, formatting) incur significant loss. Combined violations (adding activities: -3.0; assignment mismatches: -2.0; partial vocab/format strengths: +1.0 offset) yield a low score, far from perfect alignment.
