The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth answer in both content and formatting:
- All and only the relevant parallel task sets from Process B are listed.
- Each line contains the correct set of concurrent tasks, separated by commas.
- No unrelated (sequential) tasks or tasks from other processes are included.

No errors or omissions are present.
