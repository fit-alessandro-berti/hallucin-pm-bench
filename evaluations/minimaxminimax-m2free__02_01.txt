### Evaluation:
The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, with no deviations in values or format. However, Q5 contains a significant error: it incorrectly includes "Receive_Order" in the list, despite this activity appearing as the first event in cases A-9321 and B-1045 (based on timestamp ordering per case). The ground truth correctly omits it, listing only the three activities that truly never start a case. This misidentification of first events per case violates the instruction to use only facts directly inferable from the log (requiring timestamp-based sorting within cases). Under strict evaluation, this error in one key question deducts substantial points, but the overall JSON structure, completeness, and accuracy of the other four questions prevent a lower score.
