6.0

- The "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" sections of the LLM answer use only the element IDs (e.g., check_vip), whereas the ground truth requires both the task's name and its id (e.g., Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)). This is a notable omission.
- For "Gateway type changes", the LLM answer omits the exact format and full description of the change: it writes simply "gw_valid (exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway)" instead of the ground truth's more explicit '`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)'.
- The LLM answer misses the required formatting (bold, parenthesis, id labels) as in the ground truth.
- There are no incorrect differences/extra items mentioned, which avoids a further penalty.

These deviations—especially the omission of names and inadequate change descriptions—constitute a significant error, but the answer is not wholly incorrect and does report the right differences. Thus, a 6.0 is appropriate.
