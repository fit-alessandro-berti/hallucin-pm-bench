The LLM answer correctly identifies the core differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, it incurs significant point loss for the following strict violations:

- **Use of element names**: The instruction requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML." BPMN tasks have both `id` and `name` attributes; the ground truth properly includes the full names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"), reflecting the XML content. The LLM only lists IDs, omitting names entirely, which makes the response factually incomplete and non-compliant.
- **Heading format**: The required headings use bullets (• Added tasks, etc.); the LLM uses Markdown headers (###), deviating from the exact format. The ground truth uses bolding (**), which is closer but still imperfect—LLM's is a clearer mismatch.
- **Gateway detail**: The LLM's description is concise but lacks the ground truth's explicit versioning ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), reducing precision. No speculation is present in either, which is good, but completeness suffers.
- Minor: No extraneous content (good), but the overall response is less readable and informative without names.

These errors, especially the missing names, warrant a mid-range score despite factual accuracy on changes.
