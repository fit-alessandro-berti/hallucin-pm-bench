8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities strictly by waiting time: #1 Request_Documents (avg 36.5h, 95p 120.0h), #2 Send_Closure_Letter (avg 12.2h, 95p 44.0h), and #3 Assess_Liability (avg 7.8h, 95p 16.4h), using the exact figures from the table. It avoids discussing service-time, throughput, or other activities, as required.

**Errors and issues:**
- Wording of recommended actions differs, and some are less concrete/data-driven or add unsupported data:
    - For Request_Documents, the LLM cites “65% of requests stall beyond this threshold” which is not in the provided data, violating the “do not invent unsupported data” criterion. The ground truth says “pilot tests show a ≥25 % cut in queue time,” which is more precise and supported.
    - For Send_Closure_Letter, the LLM suggests real-time alerts for unresolved tasks due to “manual handoff lags (80% of delays)”—again inventing a statistic not present. The ground truth specifically recommends e-signature letters, which directly addresses the cause.
    - For Assess_Liability, the LLM introduces allocation based on predictive models, a different but plausible remedy, while the ground truth action (rules-engine pre-classification to bypass queuing) is more process-focused and adequately justified.
- The memo slightly exceeds the strict “≤ 150 words” limit and includes mild extra framing (“Expected Impact” and “Data Scope” lines) instead of sticking only to the essentials.
- The instruction to "quote waiting-time figures verbatim" is slightly missed—though figures are correct, the format differs slightly from the ground truth (hyphens, etc.).

**Conclusion:**  
While accurate in rankings and numbers, the LLM answer loses points for inventing supporting statistics/causes, using recommendations not fully in line with the ground truth, and including minor unnecessary framing text. These small but notable differences merit a reduction, thus an **8.0**.
