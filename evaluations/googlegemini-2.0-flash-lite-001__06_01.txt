9.5

**Reasoning:**  
The LLM answer correctly lists both pairs:

- Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
- Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

The ground truth uses different spacing between "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines," but that is a formatting/presentation issue, not a factual one. The pairs themselves (task names and ordering) are alphabetically correct within each pair and as a list.

**Strictness assessment:**
- The format exactly matches the instructions (one pair per line, alphabetical order within and across pairs, correct delimiter).
- The answer contains no extraneous information and ignores Process A.
- The only (very minor) flaw is lack of extra spaces for alignment/presentation seen in the ground truth, but this is not explicitly required in the prompt.

**Score deduction:**  
- As per "evaluate with the utmost strictness" including "small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," the lack of vertical alignment for output formatting (though not explicitly instructed by the prompt and not reasoning related) warrants a small deduction of 0.5.

**Conclusion:**  
The response is nearly perfect; thus, the strict score is **9.5**.
