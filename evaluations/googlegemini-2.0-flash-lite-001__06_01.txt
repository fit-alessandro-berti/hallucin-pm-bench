The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, identifying the correct and only two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), with proper alphabetical ordering within pairs and across the list. No additional or missing pairs. The format adheres to the specified structure (one pair per line, "Task_X  —  Task_Y"). The minor spacing difference in the second line of the ground truth (extra spaces for visual alignment in a code block) is a rendering artifact and not a substantive error in the output.
