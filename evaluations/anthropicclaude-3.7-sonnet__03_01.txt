### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core process flow, including the start event, auto-classification, two exclusive gateways (for ticket type and resolution path), the re-work loop back to "Initial Diagnosis," shared "Resolve Issue" task after internal or specialist paths, confirmation gateway, and end event, aligning with the description's 10 lines without adding unmentioned elements like timers or extra activities. The XML is a single <definitions> block under 40 lines, and no diagram elements are included. However, under utmost strictness, several errors and deviations from the ground truth significantly deduct points:

- **Invented Condition Expressions (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM uses custom FEEL-like expressions (e.g., `#{ticketType == "Password Reset"}`, `#{resolvable == true}`, `#{resolved == true}`) with unmentioned variables (ticketType, resolvable, resolved). The ground truth uses simple "yes"/"no" labels via `<conditionExpression xsi:type="tFormalExpression">`. This invents logic not "exactly as stated," violating the "do not invent" rule and adding implicit data elements.

- **Inaccurate Task Types and Names (Moderate Deduction: -0.5 points)**: "Classify Ticket" is modeled as `<serviceTask>` (implying automation), but ground truth uses `<task>` for "Auto-Classification." Names differ slightly (e.g., start event "Support Ticket Submitted" vs. "Ticket Submitted"; gw1 "Ticket Type?" vs. "Password Reset?"; gw2 "Resolution Path" vs. "Resolved Internally?"). These are small but require significant loss per instructions.

- **Non-Concise IDs (Moderate Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Uses descriptive IDs (e.g., `classifyTicket`, `resetPassword`, `initialDiagnosis`) instead of short ones like `t1`, `t2`, `gw1` as prompted (e.g., "concise IDs (e.g., t1, gw1)"). Sequence flows are `sf1`-`sf13` (concise), but tasks/gateways are not.

- **Structural/Attribute Mismatches (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Missing `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` declaration; definitions lacks `isExecutable="false"`; different `targetNamespace` and added `id="def1"`; process `id` and `name` differ ("supportTicketProcess" vs. "support_ticket"; "AcmeTech Support Ticket Process" vs. "Support-Ticket").

The response avoids common hallucinations (e.g., no timers, no extra tasks like "Approve Closure"), but cumulative strict deviations prevent a higher score. A perfect match would require identical XML structure, types, conditions, IDs, and names.
