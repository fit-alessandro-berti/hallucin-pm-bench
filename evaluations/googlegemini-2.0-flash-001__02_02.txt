9.5

**Justification:**

- **Q1:** LLM correctly identifies 3 distinct cases: C001, C002, and C003. (Matches ground truth perfectly.)
- **Q2:** LLM lists "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" for C002. (Perfect match.)
- **Q3:** LLM outputs:
  - Arrange_Delivery 
  - Check_Stock

  This matches the ground truth layout and content exactly, except that the ground truth uses the underscores in activity names ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock"), whereas the LLM uses spaces ("Arrange Delivery" and "Check Stock").

**According to the instructions, even small formatting deviations (here, underscores replaced by spaces) should be reflected in a significant score reduction. The factual content is 100% correct, but the strictest reading demands proper formatting is also correct. Thus:**

- Deduction of 0.5 points due to formatting error (underscores missing in activities in Q3).

**Final score:** 9.5
