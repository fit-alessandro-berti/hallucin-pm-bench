**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under utmost strictness:

- **Extra unauthorized content**: Added title, separate "Key" table, and "Notes" section (ground truth has only the matrix table).
- **Incorrect activities**: 7 rows vs. 6; added/split "Payment Scheduling" and "Fund Release & Notification" (vs. single "Release Funds"); violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities."
- **RACI mismatches** (nearly every cell differs):
  | Activity | Key differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | CompA: I vs. C; Treas: — vs. I |
  | KYC Review | Front: I vs. —; CO: — vs. C; Treas: — vs. I |
  | AML Screening | Same as KYC (Front I vs. —; CO — vs. C; Treas — vs. I) |
  | Risk Scoring | Front: I vs. C; CompA: R/A vs. R; CO: I vs. A; Treas: — vs. I |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | Treas: I vs. — |
  | End activity(ies) | Extra row; CompA/CO: I vs. C |
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: "R / A" vs. "**R, A**"; "—" vs. "–"; inconsistent bolding; different table styling.
- No full row matches; core intent (RACI coverage) distorted by errors.

Even minor variances (e.g., symbols, spacing) compound to total failure against ground truth.
