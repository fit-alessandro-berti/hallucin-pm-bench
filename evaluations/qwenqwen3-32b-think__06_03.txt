9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks and numbers them in the proper order as requested. However, it lacks the explicit labeling of which parallel block each set represents (i.e., “first parallel block” and “second parallel block”) and the precise separation with “‖” as in the ground truth. The LLM answer omits the final confirmation sentence (“No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel”). Although these omissions are minor, they do represent small deviations from the ground truth. Thus, the score is slightly reduced to 9.0.
