**6.0**

### Evaluation Summary
- **Overall Correctness (Answer)**: Both correctly identify "No" (non-compliant), matching ground truth. (+2.0 points)
- **Rule-by-Rule Accuracy** (strict per-rule assessment, 2.0 points max per rule, total 8.0 possible):
  | Rule | LLM Assessment | Ground Truth | Score | Reason for Deduction |
  |------|----------------|--------------|--------|----------------------|
  | 1    | ❌ Violated (wrongly claims NA between violates "both complete before other actions") | ✔ Satisfied | 0.0 | Significant error: misinterprets Rule 1 (only requires once each, QE before RA; no "no actions between" clause). Conflates with Rule 3. |
  | 2    | ✔ Satisfied | ✔ Satisfied | 2.0 | Exact match. |
  | 3    | ❌ Violated | ❌ Violated | 2.0 | Exact match, correct reasoning. |
  | 4    | ✔ Satisfied | ✔ Satisfied | 2.0 | Exact match. |
  - **Subtotal**: 6.0/8.0 (full deduction for Rule 1 error as "significant loss" per instructions).
- **Justification Quality/Format**: Short, references each rule, structured list (similar to ground truth table). Minor style differences (no ✔/❌ or table) but compliant with prompt. (+0.0 extra deduction).
- **Strictness Applied**: Rule 1 error is not "small" (fabricates rule requirement, wrong summary "violations of 1 and 3"); halves potential perfection despite correct overall verdict. No other issues (ignores irrelevant trace events correctly).
