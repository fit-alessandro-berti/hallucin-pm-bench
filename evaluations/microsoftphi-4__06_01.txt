6.5

The LLM answer correctly identified the only two eligible pairs and provided brief (and correct) rationale. However, there are **notable formatting errors** and one ordering mistake:

1. **Incorrect Pair Ordering:**  
   - "Quality_Check — Create_Documentation" is not in alphabetical order within the pair; it should be "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check".

2. **Inconsistent Formatting:**  
   - The first pair uses double spaces around “—”, while the second uses only single spaces, which deviates from the required consistent format: `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (double spaces on both sides).
   - The expected answer lists pairs with aligned spacing for neatness, per the ground truth, but the LLM's answer doesn't.

3. **Overall Order:**  
   - The overall order is correct (“Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines” comes after “Create_Documentation — Quality_Check”), so only the within-pair alpha sort is wrong for one pair.

4. **No Extra or Missing Pairs:**  
   - The list is complete and does not contain spurious items.

**Strict scoring:**  
- Pair detection is correct: +3 each (6 points)
- Sorting within pairs: -1 per error (1 error = -1 point)
- Formatting consistency (double spaces everywhere): minor error, -0.5
- Did not align exactly as in ground truth (tab or extra spaces between task names): very minor, 0 penalty (but already covered by formatting penalty).

Final: **6.5/10**  
(Detection perfect, but strict alphabetical order and output formatting errors justify a significant, but not catastrophic, deduction.)
