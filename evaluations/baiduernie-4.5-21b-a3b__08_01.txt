2.0

The LLM's answer is mostly incorrect.

- It states that "T5 can never fire before T3 is able to do so" and "no firing sequence exists where T5 fires before T3." This is FALSE: the ground truth shows T5 can (and must) fire before T3 if it fires at all.
- The LLM fails to analyze the scenario where T2 fires (putting a token in p3), and at that time, with p4=0, T5 IS enabled and can fire before p2→p4(T3).
- The answer doesn't explicitly work through a firing sequence, as required.

Evidence of minimal understanding is present (discussion of the inhibitor arc), so it is not a pure 1.0, but the major error—incorrect answer to the core question—merits near the lowest score. Due to the complete failure to match the key insight and firing sequence given in the ground truth, and absence of a correct justification, this deserves a 2.0 for effort in describing the arcs, but a near-total loss of credit.
