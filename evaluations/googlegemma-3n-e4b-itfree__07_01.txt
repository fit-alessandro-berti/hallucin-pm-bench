5.0

• The LLM answer correctly lists the two added tasks (check_vip and generate_qr) and the gateway type change.
• However, the LLM fails to report the removed task send_rma_label, which is a critical omission.
• The answer does not list task names or ids with the same clarity and completeness as the ground truth (which includes both name and id).
• The headings, while present, lack the explicit formatting and detail requested (e.g., "**Added tasks**" instead of "• **Added tasks**" and missing IDs/names).
• The LLM uses lowercase for headings, while the prompt and ground truth use bold formatting and consistent headings.

Given the major error of missing a removed task (send_rma_label), as well as minor formatting/clarity issues, a strict evaluation yields a 5.0.
