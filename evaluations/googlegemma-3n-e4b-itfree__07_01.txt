4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Added tasks**: Partial credit (4/10). The LLM correctly identifies the two added task IDs (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), matching the XML elements. However, it fails to use the exact element names from the XML (e.g., `name="Check Customer VIP Status"` and `name="Generate RMA QR Code"`), listing only IDs instead. The ground truth includes full names with IDs for precision, per the prompt's instruction to use "element names exactly as they appear in the XML." This omission is a significant error, as it ignores the `name` attributes, which are factual XML content.
  
- **Removed tasks**: No credit (0/10). The LLM incorrectly states "(none)," missing the clear removal of the `send_rma_label` task (present in v1 with `name="Send RMA Label"`, absent in v2). This is a critical factual omission, as the XML snippets show the flow after `approve_return` changes from `send_rma_label` to `generate_qr`, directly implying removal. Ground truth correctly identifies this; the error violates the core instruction to list *all* factual differences without speculation.

- **Gateway type changes**: Good credit (8/10). The LLM accurately notes the change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`, using XML element types exactly. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's explicit versioning (e.g., "(v1)" and "(v2)") and bolding, which adds clarity but isn't strictly requiredâ€”though under utmost strictness, this slightly reduces precision.

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average (equal parts per category) yields ~4.0, reflecting the severe impact of the missed removal (a complete category failure) and partial inaccuracies elsewhere. No speculation or extras in LLM answer, which aligns with instructions, but factual gaps dominate under strict criteria.
