The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content across all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 lists the precise sequence for C002 with correct activities and ordering using the specified separator; Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors to "Ship_Order" (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line, with no extras, omissions, or errors. Minor formatting differences (e.g., bullet points vs. plain lines in Q3, escaped underscores in ground truth A2) do not affect factual precision and warrant no deduction under strict evaluation.
