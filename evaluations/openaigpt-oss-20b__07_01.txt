The LLM's answer is very close to the ground truth but contains the following issues that warrant deduction:

- In the "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" sections, it only lists the element names/IDs (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`) instead of the required combination of task names and IDs as in the ground truth, which explicitly specifies both (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Omitting the task names is a non-trivial detail loss.
- In the "Gateway type changes" section, it omits the id format (`gw_valid`) and uses a less formal presentation ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway â†’ inclusiveGateway" rather than "[gw_valid] changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"). The LLM's answer uses the correct IDs but not the exact formatting and presentation as in the ground truth.

While all factual differences are correctly identified, strict adherence to format and completeness (including both ID and name, and matching output style) was required as per the evaluation instructions. These stylistic and information omissions justify a significant deduction.
