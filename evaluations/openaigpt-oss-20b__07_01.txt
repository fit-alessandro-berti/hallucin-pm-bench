### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of Detected Changes (8/10)**: The LLM accurately identifies all factual differences: two added tasks (check_vip, generate_qr), one removed task (send_rma_label), and the gateway type change for gw_valid (exclusive to inclusive). No speculation or extraneous items are included, and no missing categories are erroneously filled.
- **Factual Completeness and Use of XML Elements (4/10)**: Significant deduction here due to strictness. The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML." For tasks, the XML provides both `id` and `name` attributes (e.g., `name="Check Customer VIP Status"`). The LLM lists only raw `id` values (e.g., "check_vip"), omitting the descriptive `name` attributes entirely, which reduces readability and fidelity to the XML content. The ground truth correctly incorporates both for completeness. For the gateway, the LLM's concise arrow notation misses explicit version ties (v1/v2), making it less precise than the ground truth.
- **Formatting and Structure (6/10)**: Headings match closely (bolded, though prompt uses bullets like "â€¢ Added tasks"). Lists use "-" instead of ground truth's "*", which is a minor inconsistency but not fatal. No "(none)" needed, and no extra content added. However, lack of backticks, bolding for types, or parenthetical ids/names deviates from ground truth's polished, exact style, warranting a deduction under strict evaluation for small presentation errors.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Core facts are right, but omissions in XML-derived details (names) and minor phrasing/format mismatches compound to a mid-range score. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply.
