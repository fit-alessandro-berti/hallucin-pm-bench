The LLM answer is semantically accurate, correctly identifies "No" compliance due to Rule 3 violation, and references all four rules with appropriate satisfactions/violations matching the ground truth logic. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking explicit "once each" confirmation in Rule 1 justification (strictly required by rule text, omitted despite trace compliance); (2) bullet format vs. ground truth table with ✔/❌ symbols; (3) no explicit final overall non-compliance statement; (4) slightly less precise phrasing in Rule 3 (omits "both QE and RA" emphasis). These are small but warrant deduction under utmost strictness.
