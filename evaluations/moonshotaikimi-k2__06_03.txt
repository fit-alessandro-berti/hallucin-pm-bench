The LLM answer incorrectly includes preceding non-concurrent tasks (e.g., "Receive_Stock → … →" and "Store_Items → … →") in each set, which misrepresents the concurrent tasks as per the prompt's focus on branches of parallel constructs only. It also uses an inaccurate and verbose format (curly braces, arrows, bullets, and split notations) that deviates from precisely listing the concurrent task pairs, adding unnecessary elements not requested. While it correctly identifies the two parallel blocks and their exact tasks in order, these structural and scoping errors significantly undermine accuracy under strict evaluation. The ground truth's concise, labeled pairs with parallel notation are not matched.
