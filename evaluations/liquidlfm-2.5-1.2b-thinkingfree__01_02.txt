**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Completeness Failure (Major Deduction: -8.0 points)**: The prompt explicitly requires **two distinct tasks**: (1) Summarize the **decision points** AND (2) list **every required document**. The LLM answer **completely omits the decision points summary** (e.g., no mention of "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision", or "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" with their exact conditions). This is a catastrophic omission of ~50% of the required content, warranting near-total point loss under utmost strictness.
- **Documents Partial Credit (Minor Gain: +2.0 points)**: Lists all 6 required documents using exact terminology from the process. Minor inaccuracies:
  - "Proof of Address" omits "(≤ 3 months)" [small error → significant loss per instructions].
  - "Latest Income Statement" omits "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" [small error → significant loss].
  - No structure (e.g., numbering/headings as in ground truth), no explanatory note.
- **Formatting & Fidelity (No Gain)**: No sections/headings matching ground truth structure. Uses exact activity names but fails overall fidelity to prompt (e.g., no summarization of decision logic).
- **Overall**: 10.0 requires near-perfect match; this is ~30% accurate (documents only, with flaws), hence 2.0. Even "small errors" like detail omissions compound severely.
