The LLM answer is highly accurate in substance, correctly identifying the fact as inaccurate, covering all cases with precise evidence from the log (using timestamps to demonstrate reversed ordering), and concluding that the claimed sequence never occursâ€”directly addressing the "immediately before" and "always" elements. It matches the ground truth's key points without factual errors or omissions.

Minor deductions (1.0 point total) for stylistic differences: lacks the ground truth's structured formatting (e.g., bolded verdict, bullet points, "evidence-based" header) and uses timestamps instead of line references, which are equally valid but not identical to the ground truth's citation style; these are small presentation variances under strict evaluation.
