**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match in content, accuracy, and adherence to the ground truth across all four questions, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log, or errors. Minor formatting variations (e.g., "%" spacing, verbosity in explanations) are stylistic and do not constitute differences in factual correctness or derivation from the 18 log lines. Question 4 provides two clearly stated reasons directly aligning with ground truth examples ("small sample size" and "temporal bias"). All calculations, counts, and details (e.g., 1 occurrence, case A1002, 5.56%, 4 cases, ~5-hour span) are precisely verifiable from the data.
