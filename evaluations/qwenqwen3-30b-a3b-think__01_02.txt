### Evaluation Breakdown
The LLM answer is strong in identifying the core decision points and listing the required documents accurately, aligning closely with the prompt's requirements to use exact activity names and avoid standard loan terminology. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth result in point deductions:

#### Decision Points (Partial Match, ~7.5/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and their core logic (score difference threshold, amount-based branching, approval/rejection vote). No extraneous or incorrect points introduced.
- **Errors/Differences (Significant Loss)**:
  - Omits contextual positioning: Ground truth specifies "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for point 1 and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for point 2; LLM does not, which reduces precision in summarizing the process flow.
  - Point 1 phrasing: LLM uses "differ by ≤2 points; escalate... if not" (vague) vs. ground truth's detailed "If Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B scores differ by ≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate... for tie-break" (includes underwriter names, exact outcomes like "continue" vs. "escalate", and "tie-break").
  - Point 2 phrasing: LLM's "escalate to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" vs. ground truth's "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" (minor word choice, but strictness penalizes deviation from exact terminology). Also omits "system auto-approves" specificity.
  - Point 3: LLM's "(vote to approve or reject)" (lowercase, generic) vs. ground truth's "the board votes **Approve** or **Reject**" (capitalized options, bolded) and inclusion of "(MBA)"; this misses exact terminology emphasis.
- These omissions and phrasing variances, though small, alter the summary's fidelity to the process's defined flow, warranting a deduction.

#### Required Documents (Strong Match, ~9.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Lists all six exact documents from the system prompt without additions or omissions, using precise names (e.g., "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet", "Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)"). No introduction of irrelevant items.
- **Errors/Differences (Minor Loss)**:
  - Formatting: Bulleted list (▪) vs. ground truth's numbered list (1–6); while not content-affecting, strictness views this as a presentation mismatch.
  - Phrasing tweaks: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. "≤ 3 months" (extra "old" is redundant but matches original prompt, yet ground truth simplifies); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (omits "Latest", "single", "or"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (includes "template", which ground truth drops). These are tiny, but per instructions, even small variances deduct points.
  - Omits ground truth's trailing note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which reinforces the non-standard process; this leaves the list slightly less comprehensive in context, though the core list is complete.
- Overall, the list is nearly identical to the source material, so minimal deduction.

**Overall Score Rationale**: The answer is 80% aligned (captures essence without major errors), but strict evaluation penalizes incomplete details in decision points (key to the summary) and minor document phrasing/formatting issues, preventing a perfect score. No criminal or off-policy issues detected.
