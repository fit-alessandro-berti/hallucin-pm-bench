8.0

**Rationale:**

- **Structure & Terminology:** The LLM answer adheres to the required activity names ("Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision", "Final Micro-loan Board Approval") without introducing extraneous or standard loan terms. 
- **Decision Logic:** For each decision point, the answer correctly describes the branch/criteria in line with the process flow (e.g., difference in underwriter scores, threshold for loan amount, board approval). 
- **Order & Detail:** The decision points are presented succinctly and in order, but the LLM answer omits “after the Dual Underwriter Split” and “after the Neighbourhood Feedback Check,” which situate the decision points precisely in the flow, as the ground truth does. This minor lack of positional clarity costs some points.
- **Documentation List:** The list of required documents is complete and exactly matches the ground truth, both in substance and terminology. 
- **Minor Omissions:** It lacks the extra, clarifying parenthetical at the end of the ground truth ("No credit bureau report...", etc.), though this nuance is minor.

**Deduction:**  
Because the answer is strictly correct and complete in decision logic and document listing, but is missing small details (exact flow position annotations for decision points; extra clarifying note about no other documents), a 2-point deduction applies for highest strictness. 

**Final Score:** 8.0
