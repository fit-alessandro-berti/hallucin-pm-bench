**9.5**

1. The LLM answer gets each numeric answer (1, 2a, 2b) spot-on: “1”, “2.08%”, and “8.33%” as required.  
2. The free text explanation is clear, directly references the single occurrence, and warns of instability (“statistically indistinguishable from noise”), unreliability in estimates, and risk of spurious patterns. It meets all three required criteria.  
3. Minor deduction: The answer could more explicitly cite things like skewing averages or confidence intervals, and while “projecting this single point... yields unreliable performance estimates and spurious prediction patterns” is sound, it is slightly less explicit than the ground truth about variance or instability.  
4. Terminology and calculations are precise, adhering strictly to the data and instructions.

Maximum penalty is for very minor lack of explicitness in statistical terminology compared to the sample, but substance and reasoning fully align. Therefore: **9.5**.
