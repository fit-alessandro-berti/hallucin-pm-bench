The LLM answer is correct in stating that it cannot compute the metrics due to a lack of data. It notes that only column headers are present, and that actual event data, such as timestamps, is missing. This explanation is precise and avoids guessing.

However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer could be more explicit in directly stating that "Artefact A contains only column headers; all event rows and every timestamp (start_time / complete_time) have been redacted." The LLM also doesn't explicitly mention that additional raw log entries are required, which the ground truth does.

While these are minor omissions, they are required for top marks according to your strict criteria. Therefore, a deduction applies for not matching the depth and specificity of the ground truth answer.
