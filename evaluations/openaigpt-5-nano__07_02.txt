9.5

The LLM answer captures all substantive changes correctly with no omissions or additions.

**Positives:**
- All added tasks ("Task_VerifyIdentity", "Task_RequestDocs", "Task_FinalReject") are listed.
- The single removed task ("Task_RejectLoan") is correctly identified.
- The gateway-type change is described: "Gateway_Decision changed from ExclusiveGateway to InclusiveGateway."

**Minor Issues:**
- The LLM output lists only IDs in the "Added tasks" but omits the user-facing names ("Verify Identity", etc.) included in the ground truth. This is a small but notable detail, particularly when strictness is requested.
- Same applies for "Removed tasks": only the ID is mentioned, while the answer key includes both label and ID.

Therefore, while the factual accuracy is perfect, the answer lacks the clarity of dual mention (label + ID) as in the ground truth, which warrants a deduction.

**Final: 9.5**
