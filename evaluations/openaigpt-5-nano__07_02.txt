6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Accuracy (High marks here, but not perfect)**: The LLM correctly identifies all key changes—three tasks added (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), one task removed (Reject Loan), and the gateway type change (Exclusive to Inclusive). No extraneous or missed changes (e.g., ignores name changes like "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan" as instructed). This aligns with the ground truth content but lacks full detail.
- **Formatting and Structure Differences (Significant deduction)**: Headings match exactly as required, but the LLM uses simple bullets with only IDs, while the ground truth uses numbered lists, bolded names, and parentheses for IDs. This is a notable deviation in presentation, reducing clarity and fidelity—strict evaluation demands closer stylistic match.
- **Detail Omissions (Major deduction)**: 
  - Added/Removed tasks list only IDs (e.g., "Task_VerifyIdentity"), omitting names (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"), which are essential for a complete summary of changes.
  - Gateway change is accurate but incomplete: LLM says "ExclusiveGateway to InclusiveGateway" without the ground truth's explanatory details like "**exclusive** (XOR) in *v1*" to "**inclusive** (OR) in *v2*", which provides BPMN-specific context.
  - Missing the ground truth's confirmatory note ("No other additions..."), though not strictly required by the prompt, it enhances completeness.
- **Strictness Applied**: Even minor gaps (e.g., no names, less precise gateway terminology) warrant substantial point loss per instructions. Full match would be 10.0; here, ~35% deviation in detail/formatting justifies dropping to 6.5. No hallucination or errors, so not lower.
