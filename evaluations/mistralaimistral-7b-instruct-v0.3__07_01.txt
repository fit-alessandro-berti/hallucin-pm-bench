4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (partial credit, ~2.5/3.0)**: Correctly identifies `check_vip` and `generate_qr` as added (factual from XML: present in v2, absent in v1). However, uses only IDs without names or GT format (`Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)`), violating "use element names exactly as they appear" (names are in XML attributes) and differing significantly from GT structure (bullets, names first).
- **Removed tasks (0/3.0)**: Major factual error—claims "(none)" but `send_rma_label` ("Send RMA Label") is clearly in v1 XML (task + flows f5/f6) and absent in v2 (replaced by `generate_qr`). Strict policy demands perfect factual match; this misses a core difference.
- **Gateway type changes (partial credit, ~1.5/3.0)**: Detects correct change (`gw_valid`: `exclusiveGateway` → `inclusiveGateway`). But phrasing/formatting differs (numbered list, capitalized "ExclusiveGateway"/"InclusiveGateway" vs. GT's lowercase/bold/tags, specifies versions differently, no backticks).
- **Formatting/Structure (-0.5 overall)**: Headings close to prompt ("• Added tasks" etc.) but adds colons/numbers; GT uses **bold**/**stars**. Extra GT note ignored by LLM (correct per prompt). No speculation (good).
- **Overall**: 60% factual accuracy (2/3 categories correct but incomplete), but strictness for any factual omission (esp. full category miss) deducts heavily. Differences in detail/format compound loss.
