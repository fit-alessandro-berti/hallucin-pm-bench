4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth in selection, order (minor permutation), and precise quantifications (+300s for Legal and Risk; +60s for Credit; waiting times exact). However, it fails significantly on structure and adherence to instructions, warranting a low score under strict criteria:

- **Format and Memo Structure (major deduction, -3.0 points)**: The prompt requires an executive memo (≈150 words) for the COO, implying professional elements like To/From/Subject, an introductory analysis paragraph, and a cohesive narrative. The LLM output is a bare list of bullets without any header, intro (e.g., no mention of total cases or context like "4 805 completed cases"), or closing projection (e.g., no end-to-end impact estimate). This renders it non-memo-like and far from the ground truth's polished format. Word count is ~120, below the ≈150 target.

- **Bullet Points Misuse (significant deduction, -1.5 points)**: Instructions specify "bullet points only for the recommendations." The LLM incorrectly bullets the identification/analysis section, while the ground truth uses a paragraph for analysis and bolded inline details, reserving bullets solely for recs.

- **Recommendations (moderate deduction, -1.0 point)**: All recs are concrete and action-oriented, but they are more generic and less data-grounded than the ground truth's (e.g., LLM invents unsubstantiated percentages like "30%" reduction or "90 days" timeline, with vague "allocate resources" vs. ground truth's specific "add one risk analyst" or "€25k heuristic"). While both sides invent minor details (not in table), LLM's feel less tied to process specifics and lack the ground truth's projected impact.

No factual errors in data usage, but cumulative structural and instructional deviations make this a partial match at best.
