7.0

The LLM answer is largely accurate but displays several notable shortcomings compared to the ground truth and instructions:

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as the worst-performing based on both SLA breaches and high waiting times.
- Correctly quantifies the amount each activity exceeds its SLA and reports the relevant throughput and waiting time values as per the table.
- Uses bullet points *only* for recommendations, following instruction.

**Errors causing point deductions:**
1. **Omission of Memo Structure/Context:** The LLM answer omits the formal memo structure required (recipient, sender, subject). While not outright forbidden, the instructions call for an executive memo and the ground truth's format reflects standard practice at this level.
2. **No Contextualization or Summary:** The response fails to mention the sample size (number of cases analyzed) or provide any holistic context or implications for the business, which is included in the ground truth ("Analysis of 4 805 completed cases..." and "Implementing these changes...").
3. **Generic Recommendations:** Recommendations lack specificity and are more generic (e.g., “allocate additional resources,” “implement automated checks,” “process automation”), rather than the data-backed, tailored suggestions in the ground truth (such as “add one risk analyst to the peak morning window,” “automate external score retrieval,” “bypass full Legal Approval for low-risk files,” etc.). This is a significant weakness, since the user asked for "concrete, data-driven actions."
4. **No Quantified Result of Actions:** The LLM does not mention any projected improvement metrics (e.g., reduction in cycle time or SLA compliance restoration), which are present in the ground truth.
5. **Ambiguity in Action Targets:** The “reduce throughput time by 30% within 90 days” and “cut waiting time by 20%” are invented and are NOT grounded in supplied data or actual activity requirements, violating the instruction not to invent metrics or targets.
6. **Minor Formatting:** The LLM lists metrics inline inside bullet points, rather than the clear listing/format used in the ground truth, reducing clarity for an executive audience.

Given the criticality of executive communication and strict adherence to instructions, these errors — especially the inventions and lack of data-grounded specificity — warrant a significant deduction. However, as the core analytic findings and computations are correct and only minor data is omitted, a score of **7.0** is appropriate.
