The LLM answer perfectly identifies the two correct pairs from Process B that can run in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), ignores Process A, lists only those with no extras or omissions, orders them alphabetically both within pairs (C<Q, P<S) and overall (C-pair before P-pair), and uses the exact specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (with consistent "  — " spacing as shown in the prompt's example). The ground truth's extra alignment spaces on the second line and leading blank line(s) within the markdown block are stylistic/presentation choices not required by the prompt instructions, so they do not constitute errors in the LLM answer. Semantically, functionally, and per spec, it is identical and flawless—even under utmost strictness, as there are zero substantive differences or violations.
