7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact count (1) for Q1, matching the ground truth precisely.

For Q2, it adequately notes the snippet's limitations (small sample, short time span, non-representative), but omits critical analytical depth from the ground truth: statistical sampling error (e.g., rarity causing frequency swings from 0% to 7% with tiny changes, wide confidence intervals), and the risk of misestimation due to near-identical activity variants ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)") that could confuse strict vs. fuzzy matching. These omissions reduce depth for a senior analyst's perspective, warranting a deduction despite brevity compliance.
