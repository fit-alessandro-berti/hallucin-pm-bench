1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Excessive extraneous content**: Includes lengthy pre-table reasoning/discussion (e.g., deliberations on IT Support, RACI ambiguities), which the ground truth entirely omits, focusing solely on the clean table and legend.
- **Role mismatches**: Uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support; omits Operations Manager (present in ground truth) and fails to align role structure.
- **Task phrasing and coverage errors**: Tasks are numbered and phrased differently (e.g., "1. Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; combines "Release payment and send SWIFT message" and "Archive case file and notify" into single rows, while ground truth separates "Release Payment" and "Archive Record" without explicit SWIFT/notify tasks, leading to incomplete or misaligned coverage of source steps).
- **RACI assignments inaccurate**: Nearly every cell differs (e.g., Task 1: LLM has TA=R, RL=A, IT=I vs. ground truth TA=R, RL=I, OM=A, IT=C; Task 3: LLM C/R,A/I vs. ground truth C/R,A/I; Task 5/6 combined and mismatched entirely). No cell matches perfectly, indicating fundamental misinterpretation.
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses inconsistent bolding (only some entries bolded), numbered tasks, and an explanatory note; ground truth uses uniform bolding for all R/A/C/I, descriptive header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), and precise legend without extras. Fails to bold "**KYC Review**" as emphasized in ground truth.
- **Vocabulary adherence issues relative to ground truth**: While both include non-mandated IT Support, LLM explicitly discusses and justifies the violation, adding meta-commentary absent in ground truth; does not emphasize "mandated wording" as ground truth does.

These errors compound to fail the core requirement of producing a matching RACI table, with even minor phrasing/formatting differences treated as significant per instructions.
