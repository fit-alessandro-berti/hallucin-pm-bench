8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer is highly accurate in identifying and describing the core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) using exact terminology from the process, and it correctly lists all required documents without introducing extraneous standard loan terms. However, under strict evaluation criteria, minor deductions are applied for the following differences from the ground truth:

- **Decision Points Structure and Phrasing**:
  - Omits contextual placements like "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" (for the first point) and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (for the second point), reducing precision in summarizing the process flow (-0.5).
  - Specifies "proceed to step 6" in the first point, which is factually correct but not present in the ground truth's more concise "continue" phrasing (-0.2).
  - Uses "proceed to the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" instead of "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" (-0.1).
  - Minor formatting difference: italics (*approve*/*reject*) vs. bold (**Approve**/**Reject**), and adds redundant "for amounts ≥ €15 000" in the third point (-0.1).

- **Required Documents**:
  - Slight phrasing variations: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months" (-0.1); "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (adds "single" and changes "/" to "or") (-0.1); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "Community Impact Statement (CIS)" (unnecessary "template") (-0.1).
  - Uses bullet points instead of numbered list, which is functionally equivalent but deviates from ground truth format (-0.1).
  - Omits the explanatory note "(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)", which reinforces the non-standard process as per the system prompt (-0.5).

These small errors accumulate to a total deduction of 1.5 points from a perfect 10.0, resulting in 8.5. The answer remains comprehensive, faithful to the prompt's instructions, and free of major factual inaccuracies or inventions.
