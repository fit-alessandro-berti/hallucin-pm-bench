8.5

The LLM answer is quite close to the ground truth, but due to strict grading with penalty for small errors:

**Strengths:**
- Lists all three correct decision points, maintaining the specified terminology: “Underwriter Alignment Gate,” “Amount Threshold Decision,” and “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).”
- Accurately describes each decision point, with minor rewording but no introduction of external terminology.
- Lists all required submission documents using exact names.

**Deductions for small errors:**
- Under "Required Documents," the LLM answer writes “Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip),” whereas the ground truth condenses to “pay-stub/tax slip.” This is a negligible deviation, but strictness requires a minor penalty.
- “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” vs. just “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” in the ground truth. The addition of “template” is not strictly correct by reference to the provided format.
- “Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)” and “Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet” are named identically, which is correct.
- The decision point explanations are clear, but the format slightly diverges—in the ground truth, the placement of each gate in the process flow is explicit, and the stepwise context (“branch after the Dual Underwriter Split”) is given, while the LLM version omits exact placement, which impacts clarity and fidelity.
- Does not include the explicit negative statement about “no credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents”—a detail specifically shown in the ground truth’s required document section.

**Summary:**  
No major errors, but due to (1) slightly looser match on phraseology, (2) omission of contextual placement in the flow, and (3) failure to include the explicit negative note about unnecessary standard documents, an 8.5 is justified.
