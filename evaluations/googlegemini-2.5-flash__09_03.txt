The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly identifying the impossibility of computation due to redacted data in Artefact A (missing rows and timestamps), emphasizing the absence of start/complete times for "Approve Invoice," and avoiding any guesses or external knowledge. It precisely explains the limitations for average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval, while the ground truth uses "dispersion" as a synonym for standard deviation. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., additional clarification on Artefact B's irrelevance, not mentioned in ground truth) and phrasing differences ("I am unable to compute" vs. "Impossible"), which introduce negligible but present variances under strict evaluation criteria.
