9.0

The LLM’s answer is clear, accurate, and correctly identifies that the requested metrics cannot be computed due to the lack of event timestamps and rows in Artefact A. It precisely explains that the necessary data (start and complete times for “Approve Invoice”) is missing and that the provided Artefact B information does not cover the cycle time of the specified activity but refers to a different KPI.

However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer is slightly more verbose and includes minor extra information (about what would be needed and restating the meaning of Artefact B). Although all information is accurate, some of this is beyond the strict, concise explanation found in the ground truth. That extra elaboration, though helpful, makes the answer marginally less direct and pithy.

In strict grading, these small differences in conciseness and focus warrant a 1-point deduction, resulting in 9.0.
