4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Perfect: +2.5/2.5)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere, including in explanations or notes.
  
- **Structure and Format (Adequate but Incomplete: +1.0/2.5)**: The table format is present with all required activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are added (meets "unwarranted content" criterion). However, column headers use abbreviations (AM, CO, etc.) instead of full names (Account Manager, etc.), which mismatches the ground truth. No bolding on key RACI cells (e.g., **R / A**, **R**) as in ground truth. The added "Key" explanation and note on "no C needed" introduce minor unwarranted content, contradicting the ground truth's implicit use of C without explanation.

- **RACI Correctness (Poor: +1.0/5.0)**: This is the core failure, with significant deviations from the ground truth, violating the "reflect the narrative" criterion (e.g., exactly one Responsible per activity; Account Manager accountable where appropriate). Strict scoring deducts heavily for each mismatch:
  - **Receive Application**: AM is A (partial match to R/A) but lacks R; CO is I (vs. C). No Responsible assigned, breaking the "one Responsible" rule. (2 major errors)
  - **KYC Review**: CO R matches; IT I matches. But AM I (vs. A); FC I (vs. C). Missing A and C. (2 errors)
  - **Order Vetting**: AM R partial (vs. R/A); FC/IT I match. But lacks A; CO I (vs. C). (2 errors)
  - **Payment Clearance**: FC R and IT I match. But AM I (vs. A); CO I (vs. C). Missing A and C. (2 errors)
  - **Record Update**: CO I and IT R match. But AM I (vs. C); FC I (vs. C). Missing two C's. (2 errors)
  - **Notify Customer**: CO/FC/IT I match. But AM R (vs. R/A), missing A. (1 error)
  - Total: 11/24 cell mismatches, plus systemic issues (e.g., no C's used at all despite 7 in ground truth; 1 activity lacks Responsible; AM accountability missing in 5/6 activities). These are not minorâ€”each alters responsibility flow per the process narrative.

Overall, the answer captures basic structure and vocabulary but fundamentally misrepresents the RACI allocations, leading to a low score under strict criteria. Small errors (e.g., missing combined R/A notation, extra key) compound to significant deductions.
