7.5

**Justification:**

*Vocabulary policy & terms:*
- All legacy terms are correctly replaced with the mandated vocabulary: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" are used—no trace of the forbidden terms.
- Spelling and capitalization strictly match requirements.

*Structure & content:*
- The matrix presents all required activities in correct order (with correct terminology), and the roles as columns, matching the prompt.
- The RACI keys/legend are clear and does not introduce any forbidden or legacy wording, nor improper role explanations.

*Allocations of RACI:*
- There are multiple allocation errors compared to the ground truth:
    - **Receive Application**: Ground truth is "R/A" for AM; LLM gives "A" (not accounting for R). "C" for CO (GT), but LLM says "I". IT and FC are both "I" in both (matches GT for FC, but for IT, this is okay).
    - **KYC Review**: LLM gives "I" for AM (GT is "A"), "R" for CO (GT matches), "I" for FC (GT is "C"), "I" for IT (GT matches).
    - **Order Vetting**: LLM gives "R" for AM (GT is "R/A"), "I" for CO (GT is "C"), "I" for FC (matches GT), "I" for IT (matches GT).
    - **Payment Clearance**: LLM gives "I" for AM (GT is "A"), "I" for CO (GT is "C"), "R" for FC (matches), "I" for IT (matches).
    - **Record Update**: LLM gives "I" for AM (GT is "C"), "I" for CO (GT is "I"), "I" for FC (GT is "C"), "R" for IT (matches).
    - **Notify Customer**: LLM gives "R" for AM (GT is "R/A"), all others "I" (matches GT).
- The LLM answer never gives "C" (Consulted) or "R/A" (Responsible and Accountable together), while the ground truth clearly uses both when appropriate.

*Omissions/Shortcomings:*
- Fails to distinguish/match R/A rows ("R/A" is expected where specified in ground truth).
- Leaves out all "C" (Consulted), though justified with a note, even when GT expects it—this is a major deviation.
- Some A/R assignments are off: sometimes only A or only R is assigned when ground truth gives both (e.g., "R/A"; this could impact roles, especially in SOX/finance contexts).

*No extraneous information:* No extra activities, columns, or forbidden language.

**Conclusion:**  
This answer strictly follows the vocabulary policy and does not introduce forbidden words. However, the treatment of RACI assignments misses the combination R/A, ignores "C" (Consulted) roles present in the ground truth, and generally simplifies the RACI allocations, deviating from the required granularity and accuracy of the consultant's matrix. These are significant process-mapping errors, but it avoids content not requested and otherwise follows the instructions tightly.

**A 7.5 reflects strong terminology compliance, correct table structure, and sequence, but with significant RACI allocation mismatches and policy deviation regarding "C" and "R/A" notations.**
