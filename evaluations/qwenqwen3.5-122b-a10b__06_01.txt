The LLM answer perfectly matches the required content: exactly the two correct pairs (no more, no less), in correct alphabetical order both within pairs (Create_Documentation < Quality_Check; Procure_Materials < Schedule_Machines) and overall list (C... before P...), using the exact specified format of one pair per line with "Task_X  —  Task_Y" (em dash with spaces around it). The minor spacing variation before the em dash on the second line (non-aligned vs. aligned in ground truth) is not required by the prompt's format specification, which uses a generic placeholder example without mandating visual alignment in monospace. No other errors; ignores Process A correctly; no extraneous output like rationale (which is not requested and separate in ground truth). Full marks under strict evaluation, as differences are cosmetic and non-substantive.
