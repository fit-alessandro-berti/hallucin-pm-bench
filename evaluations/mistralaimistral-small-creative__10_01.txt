**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Vocabulary (perfect, +3.0 base)**: Exact use of “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”; no forbidden terms. Matches rubric.
- **Structure (partial, +1.0)**: Correct rows (6 activities), columns (4 roles), no extras added. Headers/roles present but verbose with abbreviations/explanations unlike GT's minimalism.
- **RACI Content (major failures, -5.0+)**: 
  - Responsible (R) positions match GT (1 per row, handlers per narrative), but format wrong: "R (Responsible)" vs. "**R / A**" or "**R**"; ignores combined R/A semantics.
  - Major mismatches (8+ cells): GT's C/A ignored (e.g., Receive: CO=C → I; KYC: AM=A, FC=C → I/I; Order Vetting: CO=C → A; Payment: AM=A/CO=C → I/I; Record: AM=C/FC=C → I/I). LLM defaults to I excessively.
  - Introduces "A (Approver)" semantics (nonstandard vs. GT's Accountable); claims "C not applicable" (false, GT has 7 Cs).
- **Formatting/Style (errors, -1.0)**: Excessive bolding (all activities/Rs vs. GT selective), verbose cells, mismatched headers (e.g., "**Account Manager (AM)**" vs. "Account Manager").
- **Unwarranted content (violations, -3.0)**: Intro sentence, "### Key Notes" section with explanations/inaccuracies (e.g., C "not applicable"); GT has none.
- **Overall**: ~30-40% match (vocab/Rs good, but core RACI semantics/format/extras diverge heavily). Strict rubric deducts significantly for all differences; not "reflect[ing] the narrative" as GT interprets (AM Accountable appropriately, Cs present).
