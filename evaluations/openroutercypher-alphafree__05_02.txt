The LLM answer violates multiple core rules: it reverses three sequenceFlows instead of at most one, modifies an unauthorized attribute (dueDate on PrepareContract), produces a multi-hunk diff instead of a single hunk, drastically alters the process flow (creating loops and invalid sequencing), and provides a rationale unrelated to the ground truth's simple dueDate adjustment for SLA compliance, resulting in zero alignment with the expected output.
