2.0

The LLM answer made several significant changes that violate the explicitly stated constraints of the prompt as well as core process logic:

- The instructions strictly limited changes to the modification of existing element attributes or (if strictly necessary) reversing the direction of one `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>`. The LLM answer, however, rewired multiple `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>` elements, altering the process flow in a way that substantially changes execution semantics, which is non-compliant.
- It adjusted the sequence of activities, arranging for contract preparation after signing, which does not reflect realistic onboarding or the original process intention, and constitutes additional, unauthorized logic changes.
- It also altered the due date of "Prepare Contract" to 4 days, diverging from the prompt (where the allowed modification would be to due dates only for "Collect Equipment" to achieve SLA compliance).

The ground truth answer only changed the `camunda:dueDate` of "Collect Equipment" from 5 to 2 days, a minimal and compliant change that does not affect process structure.

Due to violation of key rules (rewiring multiple flows, altering process structure, changing logic of activities well beyond attribute modification), almost the minimum score is warranted. A score slightly higher than 1.0 is given because a rationale was provided and the response was formatted as a diff, but the answer fundamentally fails the core requirements.
