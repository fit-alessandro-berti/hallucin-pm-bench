**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, + significant credit)**: Uses exactly "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring". No leaks of disallowed terms. Matches key judge point.
- **Structure (partial)**: Markdown table format correct; roles/columns match exactly. No renaming/merging/adding *beyond* the four terms.
- **Completeness (major failure, -heavy penalty)**: Covers only 4 activities vs. ground truth's 6 ("every activity described" includes "Compliance Officer approval" and "Treasury Ops releases funds/schedules payment"). Missing rows = critical omission.
- **RACI assignments (mostly incorrect, -heavy penalty)**:
  | Activity | Matching cells | Differences |
  |----------|----------------|-------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Comp. Analyst (C), Treas. Ops (I) | Front-Office: R vs. **R,A**; Comp. Officer: I vs. – |
  | KYC Review | Treas. Ops (I) | Front-Office: C vs. –; Comp. Analyst: R vs. **R,A**; Comp. Officer: A vs. C |
  | AML Screening | Treas. Ops (I) | Same as KYC (all 3 cells wrong) |
  | Risk Scoring | All 4 cells match (C/R/A/I) | None (perfect row, ignoring bold) |
  - Only ~25% of cells align perfectly across shared rows. Ignores "R,A" combos, uses letters universally instead of – for no involvement.
- **Formatting (minor errors, -penalty)**: No **bold** on activities/assignments; no – dashes; slight header spacing variance.
- **Overall**: Vocab saves it from 1.0, but incompleteness + widespread RACI errors + formatting = low score under "utmost strictness" (small errors like missing A or wrong letter = significant loss; here, compounded). ~30% fidelity to ground truth.
