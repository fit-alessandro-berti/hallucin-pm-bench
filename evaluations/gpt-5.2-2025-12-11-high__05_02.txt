The LLM answer proposes the exact same XML modification (changing `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" on the identical task with matching whitespace), adheres to the output format (unified single-hunk diff followed by one-sentence rationale), and correctly follows all rules (one attribute change, no adds/deletes), but loses points for minor strict deviations: inclusion of non-essential unified diff file headers ("--- a/onboarding.bpmn" / "+++ b/onboarding.bpmn") not present in ground truth (introducing an arbitrary filename absent from the prompt XML), absence of the ground truth's trailing second "@@" line in the diff hunk, and a rephrased rationale with different wording/emphasis ("task due date" vs "due-date", no bolding, "largest single contributor to end-to-end delay" / "far less likely ... breaches the overall SLA" vs specific "keeps ... inside the contractual 3-day SLA without introducing any new activities", omitting the rules-reinforcing "no new activities" phrase).
