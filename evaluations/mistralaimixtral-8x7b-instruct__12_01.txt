**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally flawed: it correctly states the fact is inaccurate but provides an incorrect and incomplete justification. It misreads case 1003 (claiming "Quality_Check" is *between* "Authorize_Refund" and "Update_Inventory", implying reversed order; actually, "Update_Inventory" precedes "Quality_Check" then "Authorize_Refund"). It ignores case 1001 (reversed order) and case 1002 (no "Update_Inventory", disproving "always"). No match to ground truth's comprehensive, evidence-based structure citing all cases. Major factual errors and omissions under strict evaluation.
