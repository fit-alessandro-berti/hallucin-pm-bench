The LLM answer is correct and concise: it states the average cycle time cannot be determined due to lack of timestamps, which is the expected core reasoning. However, it loses 1 point for not explicitly mentioning that only event counts were provided and that intervals between start and completion events are absent, as the ground truth does. Even slight omissions in precision should be penalized per instruction.
