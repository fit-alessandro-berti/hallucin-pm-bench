The LLM answer matches the ground truth in structure (Yes/No followed by justification citing CaseIDs and sequences), accuracy (correctly identifies immediate vs. non-immediate cases for all four cases with no factual errors), and conclusion (rejects the "always" claim due to counterexamples). Minor differences are limited to formatting (bullets with timestamps vs. table without) and phrasing, but these do not introduce errors or omissions, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements.
