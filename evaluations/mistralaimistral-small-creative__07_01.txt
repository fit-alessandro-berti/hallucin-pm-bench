### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks (partial credit, 2/3)**: Correctly identifies both `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, but uses incorrect full XML tag format instead of ground truth's concise "name (id = `id`)" style. Instruction requires "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," which ground truth interprets as name+id; LLM deviates significantly (-1 point).
- **Removed tasks (0/3)**: Completely wrong—claims "(none)" but `send_rma_label` ("Send RMA Label") is clearly present in v1 XML and absent in v2. This is a factual error missing a core difference (-3 points).
- **Gateway type changes (partial, 1/3)**: Correctly identifies change from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway` for `gw_valid`, but uses verbose full XML tags instead of ground truth's concise "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)". Deviates from exact style (-2 points).
- **Overall structure/formatting (-1)**: Headings not "exact" (uses `### **Added tasks**` with `---` separators instead of plain `**Added tasks**` with `*` bullets); adds extraneous intro text ("Here are the factual differences..."). Violates "list **only** the factual differences" and exact grouping.
- **Strictness adjustment**: Small format errors compound (e.g., bolding, extras); major content omission (removal) warrants severe deduction. Total reflects ~40% alignment with ground truth.
