7.0

The LLM answer is broadly accurate but notable differences and small errors accrue significant point loss as required:

**Positives:**
- All correct documents are listed, none are missing or invented.
- Decision points are identified and generally match process logic.
- No forbidden legacy activities or artefacts are introduced.

**Issues:**
- The ground truth specifies three decision points: eligibility during triage, the amount threshold after finance pre-approval, and the final payment approval (which can end the process on rejection). The LLM answer omits explicit mention of the possibility of rejection/outcome termination at each decision point except the eligibility check (“determines whether the claim can move forward”), and does not describe the explicit rejection path at finance controller and/or senior auditor stage.
- The LLM lumps the “final payment approval” into the high-value review and finance pre-approval but less explicitly calls out the possibility of rejection; the ground truth mandates clarification that the process ends for rejected claims.
- Wording is less precise; for example, the “High-Value Refund Assessment” is not a true decision point: the branch should be after finance pre-approval, with explicit logic about which claims proceed to auditor review and which do not.
- The presentation of branching logic and outcomes per decision point (as in the table in the ground truth) is missing; the summary covers outcomes for the threshold branch but is less explicit for others.
- The LLM uses different terminology ("Triage Eligibility Check"/"Finance Pre-Approval")—while acceptable, this reduces precision compared to the process names in ground truth.

Given the guideline to be strict and penalize even small errors, a 7.0 reflects overall correctness minus significant detail/completeness/clarity errors compared to the ground truth.
