**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correct elements (+ partial credit)**: Overall "No" is correct (1 pt). Rule 3 violation correctly identified with accurate reasoning (1.5 pts). Rule 2 correctly satisfied (1 pt). Covers all rules (0.5 pt).
- **Major errors (- heavy deductions)**: 
  - Rule 1: Incorrectly marked **violated**; QE precedes RA (once each), fully satisfying rule 1 per ground truth and trace (QE at pos. 3, RA at 5). Justification confuses with NA position (-2.5 pts).
  - Rule 4: Incorrectly marked **violated**; CC (pos. 7) is *after* NA (pos. 4) *and* VP (pos. 6), satisfying rule 4 per ground truth. Factual trace misreading ("CC before NA", "NA pending") is a critical error (-2.5 pts).
- **Minor issues**: Justification format deviates (numbered list vs. table, less precise), adds extraneous "RA out of place" note (-0.5 pt).
- **Total**: Significant factual deviations on 2/4 rules (50% error rate) warrant strict penalty; not close to ground truth precision.
