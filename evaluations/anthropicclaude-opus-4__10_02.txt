5.0

- **Correct Mandated Vocabulary:** The LLM answer consistently uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst" instead of proscribed terms, in line with the prompt.
- **Task Naming / Scope:** Several task names (“Receive and log transfer instruction”, “Screen payment against sanctions list”) are serviceable, though not always reworded to match the concise/mandated forms of the ground truth (e.g., “Receive Payment Instruction”, “Archive Record”). The LLM table sometimes combines or splits activities differently (e.g., “Notify completion of archiving” isn’t in ground truth; “Ensure SWIFT message transmission” is overly detailed vs. ground truth’s “Release Payment”).
- **RACI Assignments:**
  - Omits the **Operations Manager** role entirely, a direct divergence from the ground truth—this is a substantial process documentation error, regardless of the prompt’s informal input.
  - In several tasks, merges Responsible and Accountable to a single party (e.g., "Regulatory Liaison" as R/A), which reduces clarity and isn’t consistent with the ground truth’s more precise split.
  - “Consulted” and “Informed” attributions differ in several tasks (e.g., Transaction Analyst "I" instead of "C" on KYC Review and Approval), and extra “C” and “I” assignments appear in places where the ground truth has none.
  - “IT Support” is generally mapped too late in the flow, and some tasks are redundantly listed (“Notify completion of archiving”).
- **Missing/Odd Tasks:** Introduces “Notify completion of archiving” which isn’t in the informal description or the ground truth—the prompt says not to add invented activities. “Ensure SWIFT message transmission” is a technical sub-step not mapped in the ground truth and could be considered extra.
- **Formatting:** Markdown structure and legend are properly presented.

**Summary:** While the LLM follows much vocabulary guidance, its failure to include the “Operations Manager” (critical as per the model answer), deviation/occasional inflation of sub-tasks, and various RACI misassignments show a significant shortfall versus the required level of precise conformity. Small differences add up, and the omission of an entire role is major. Thus, a 5.0 reflects these considerable, compounding issues despite an otherwise organized table and respect for most mandated language.
