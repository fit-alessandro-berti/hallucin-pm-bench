### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt's requirements (e.g., strict use of mandated vocabulary like "KYC Review," "Transaction Analyst," and "Regulatory Liaison") but deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and RACI assignments, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Roles**: Omits "Operations Manager" (present in ground truth as the primary "Accountable" role across tasks), limiting the matrix to only three roles instead of four. This creates incomplete accountability mapping, as ground truth relies on Operations Manager for "A" in nearly every task.
  
- **Tasks**: Introduces unnecessary splits and extras not in ground truth (e.g., separate "Ensure SWIFT message transmission" and "Notify completion of archiving," which ground truth consolidates into "Release Payment" and "Archive Record"). Task wordings also differ slightly (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"), violating the prompt's emphasis on clear organization without omissions or substitutions. All informal description steps are covered but fragmented, leading to redundancy.

- **RACI Assignments**: Major mismatches in nearly every row, even where tasks align:
  - "Receive": Misses "A" (Operations Manager) and "C" (IT Support); ground truth has these.
  - "Screen": Misses "I" (Operations Manager) and "C" (IT Support).
  - "KYC Review": Combines "R/A" under Regulatory Liaison (non-standard; ground truth separates "R" to Regulatory Liaison and "A" to Operations Manager); misses "I" (IT Support).
  - "Approve High-Risk": "I" for Transaction Analyst vs. "C" in ground truth; again, combined "R/A" and missing "A"/"I".
  - "Release": "A" assigned to Regulatory Liaison (incorrect; ground truth has "I" there and "A" to Operations Manager); SWIFT handling mismatched.
  - "Archive": "I" for Transaction Analyst vs. "C"; misses "A" (Operations Manager).
  These errors alter the process flow and responsibility distribution fundamentally.

- **Format and Extras**: Includes unrequested elements like a title header ("# AtlasRemit RACI Matrix"), subsection ("## Process"), and "Notes" section, which ground truth avoids for a clean table-only output. Uses "R/A" shorthand (explained in notes), but ground truth assigns distinctly without such notation. Legend is similar but positioned differently; table lacks ground truth's "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header and bolding for "KYC Review."

Small errors (e.g., phrasing inconsistencies, non-standard notation) compound with larger structural issues, resulting in only partial fidelity (~35% alignment). The answer is functional as a RACI but fails to mirror the ground truth's precision and mandated-only focus.
