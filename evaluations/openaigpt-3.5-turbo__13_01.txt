**8.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1 (25% weight)**: Correct count (1), but verbose phrasing ("The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs 1 time in this fragment.") deviates from concise ground truth ("`1` occurrence"). Minor deduction for non-minimal response. **Score: 9.0**
- **Q2 (25% weight)**: Exact match on value (5.56%) and rounding; minor formatting diff (no space before "%"). No calculation shown (not required but ideal has note). **Score: 9.8**
- **Q3 (25% weight)**: Correct case (A1002), but phrasing ("The case identifier(s) ... is A1002") has grammar error ("identifier(s)" plural but "is" singular), lacks "Only case" emphasis, and no bold/exact match. **Score: 8.0**
- **Q4 (25% weight)**: Identifies two valid sampling reasons ("small sample size" matches exactly; "not representative... bias" vaguely aligns with case-mix bias). However, lacks "stated clearly" with specifics from log (e.g., "18 events across just four cases", "high variance", "±5.56 pp", or details on temporal window/case-mix/survivorship). Reasons are generic/untied to fragment, reducing precision. **Score: 7.0**

**Weighted average: 8.2**. High accuracy overall, but strict penalties for phrasing, grammar, vagueness, and missing log-tied details in Q4 per ground truth expectations. No hallucinations, adheres to no-inference rule.
