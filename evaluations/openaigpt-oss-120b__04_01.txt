The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with appropriate citations and explanations, aligning with the ground truth on the reasons for non-compliance. However, it deducts points for incompleteness: it omits evaluations of Rules 1, 4, and 5 (which are satisfied per the ground truth), failing to provide a comprehensive numbered justification for all rules as in the ground truth. Additionally, minor deductions for a slight discrepancy in Rule 3 wording ("four positions after" vs. ground truth's "distance=3") and less structured formatting (e.g., no explicit conclusion or full rule-by-rule check).
