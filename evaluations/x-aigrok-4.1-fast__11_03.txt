7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Perfect match on the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment—in same order, correctly selected jointly on SLA breaches + high waiting times). Exact matching quantification of SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s) and waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Bullet points used *only* for recommendations (one per activity). Memo format present, ~150 words, grounded in table data (e.g., cases, times used directly; no absent activities/metrics). No major inventions beyond minor derivations.
- **Weaknesses (deductions for differences/strictness)**: Significant textual/phrasing differences throughout (headers, intro, subject, structure—e.g., full bold memo vs. simpler italicized; extra summary list para; "455 total disbursements" tie-in absent in ground truth). Recommendations completely different content (generic data-tied vs. specific inventive ones like "€25k" or "morning window"—but LLM's are arguably more data-grounded). Derived % metrics (50%, 100%, 25%) not in table ("no metrics not provided"—small error, major deduction per instructions: -1.0). Minor extras like word count, [Current Date], "pending"/"high-volume" inferences. Ground truth has worse inventions (e.g., "4 805 cases", 35% projection, loan specifics), but grading purely on *differences* pulls score down. Utmost strictness applied: ~25% mismatch in key sections (recs, phrasing) = notable loss from 10.
