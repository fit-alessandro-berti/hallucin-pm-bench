7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part 1 (Factual Count)**: Accurate and complete (matches ground truth exactly on count; extra details like case ID and timestamp are harmless and data-driven). Full credit here.
- **Part 2 (Explanation)**: Concise (under 120 words) and covers key ideas like small/unrepresentative sample, time window, potential string variants, and process variations/repetitions. However, significant deductions for: (1) factual error claiming "four cases" (actual: three casesâ€”1001, 1002, 1003), which undermines credibility; (2) generic discussion of bias without ground truth's precise quantification (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours, frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, rare event sampling error); (3) overemphasis on unrelated issues like "multiple activity repetitions" dilutes focus on core sampling/variant pitfalls. This reduces analytical sharpness and introduces minor speculation on "variant names for manual checks" (not evidenced for manual but for automatic). Overall, solid but not rigorous enough for full marks under strict criteria.
