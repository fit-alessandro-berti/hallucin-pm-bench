**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1 (claims "No" vs. ground truth "Yes"), provides no valid sequence for Q2 (unnecessarily, due to wrong Q1), and gives flawed reasoning by ignoring the parallel path to P4 via T2→T7 (mistakenly assumes T3 is the sole/required producer of P4 token). This inverts the entire conclusion, with zero alignment to ground truth sequence or explanation. No partial credit for minor structural adherence (e.g., labeling Q1/Q2); core factual error warrants minimum score under strict criteria.
