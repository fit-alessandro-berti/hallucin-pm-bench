The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" with a valid, minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, accurately describes the markings, and provides a brief justification matching the prompt's requirement. It has no factual errors, unlike the ground truth (which includes an impossible T4 firing after p3 is consumed by T5).

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total):**
- Lacks the ground truth's deeper insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 if ever (permanently disabled afterward), reducing justification depth despite "briefly" requested.
- Phrasing differences (e.g., "T2 and T3 are independent" is true but less precise than GT's enabling condition breakdown; sequence stops early without showing post-T3 behavior).
- Stylistic variances (e.g., no step numbers, less formal markings notation).

Under utmost strictness, perfect identity would be 10.0; these small non-critical differences warrant deduction, but core correctness and brevity align closely with the prompt.
