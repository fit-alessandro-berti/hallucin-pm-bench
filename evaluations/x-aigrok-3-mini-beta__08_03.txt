The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (matching the ground truth) and provides a valid shortest sequence to fire T5 without T3 (T1, T2b, T4, T5), with accurate step-by-step markings verifying pc remains empty (T3 unfired). However, it differs significantly from the ground truth in presentation and completeness: (1) it lists only the 4-step sequence to T5, omitting the ground truth's extension to T6 and T3 despite the question not requiring it; (2) it lacks the ground truth's detailed "why this works" explanation (e.g., role of shortcut T2b, feedback via T6 for later T3); (3) it does not justify why the sequence is shortest (e.g., lower bound analysis). These omissions and structural differences, while not factually wrong, reduce alignment under strict evaluation, warranting a deduction.
