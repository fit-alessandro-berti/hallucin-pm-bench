9.0

The LLM answer is factually accurate, correctly identifies "No" as the response, and provides a valid one-paragraph justification citing the key counterexamples (C003 with lines 6-7, and C005 with line 11 and absence of Receive_Order) that match the ground truth's core reasoning. It appropriately emphasizes the "always" qualifier by noting where the pattern holds (C001, C002, C004), which bolsters the disproof without introducing errors. However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.0 point for minor differences: including unnecessary details on positive cases (not present in ground truth, potentially diluting conciseness), slight phrasing variances (e.g., "occurs before" vs. "occurs first"), and lack of ground truth's bullet-point structure and exact wording/formatting, which create subtle deviations from the gold-standard presentation.
