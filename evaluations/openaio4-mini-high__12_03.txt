The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No"), provides a precise justification by citing the two relevant counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with accurate activity sequences, and directly addresses the "always" claim by showing violations. This fulfills the task requirements without factual errors. However, it deducts a point for lacking the ground truth's exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all cases (omitting C001 and C003, where the rule holds), resulting in a less comprehensive structure despite sufficiency for disproof.
