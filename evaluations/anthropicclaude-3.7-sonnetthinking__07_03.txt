The LLM answer is nearly identical in content to the ground truth, correctly identifying all added tasks (3), the removed task (1), and both gateway type changes with precise IDs, names, and transition formats (exclusive → parallel). However, it introduces minor but verifiable formatting deviations: (1) unnecessary "#" markdown prefixes on all headings, which add extraneous elements not present in the ground truth or required by the prompt's "verbatim" instruction for headings; (2) lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. ground truth's spaced version for visual alignment). These small output inconsistencies violate the strict "output must contain only the three required headings and the concrete differences" rule, warranting a deduction despite perfect functional accuracy.
