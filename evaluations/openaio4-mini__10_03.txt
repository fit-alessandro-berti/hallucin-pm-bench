### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using the exact mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks from the narrative. However, it fails strictly on the prompt's core instruction to cover **every activity and role described** without renaming, merging, or **adding** activities. This results in significant deviations from the ground truth:

- **Added activity**: Introduces "Schedule Payment" (not present in ground truth; the narrative implies this as part of low-risk processing but ground truth merges it into "Release Funds").
- **Renaming/merging error**: "Release Funds and Notify Originating Analyst" renames and expands the ground truth's "Release Funds", adding unprompted details from the narrative ("notifies the originating analyst").
- **Incomplete activity set**: The matrix has 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6, violating "do not add activities" and altering coverage of the narrative (e.g., escalation approval and fund release are mishandled).
- **RACI assignment errors** (major differences across most cells, leading to ~70% mismatch):
  - **Intake Vetting**: Ground truth has Compliance Analyst as C and Compliance Officer as –; LLM incorrectly uses I for both.
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office Analyst as – and Compliance Officer as C in ground truth; LLM uses C and I.
  - **AML Screening**: Same as KYC; ground truth has – for Front-Office and C for Officer; LLM uses I and I.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Ground truth differentiates (Front-Office C, Compliance R, Officer A, Treasury I); LLM oversimplifies to Compliance R,A with all others I.
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Front-Office as I and Treasury as – in ground truth; LLM uses C and I.
  - **Release Funds**: Ground truth has Compliance Analyst C and Officer C; LLM uses I for both. The added "Schedule Payment" has no ground truth equivalent.
- **Formatting minors**: No bolding on activities or R,A (as in ground truth); uses I where ground truth uses – (no involvement). Dashes are inconsistently absent.
- **Overall strictness impact**: These are not small errors—activity additions/renames violate the "do not" rules directly, and RACI mismatches distort the process governance. Partial credit for vocabulary and table structure, but comprehensive failures warrant a low score.
