- **Vocabulary compliance:** The LLM answer uses all four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) exactly, and none of the prohibited synonyms appear. This is correct.
- **Activities:** The LLM answer adds two activities not in the ground truth: "Schedule Payment" and "Release Funds and Notify Originating Analyst" (merged into one step in the ground truth as "Release Funds"). While the instruction was not to merge or add activities, "Schedule Payment" is an extra step and "Notify Originating Analyst" is unnecessarily specified, leading to a deviation from the ground truth's activity list.
- **RACI assignments:** There are multiple mismatches:
  - For "Intake Vetting," the Front-Office Analyst is correctly "R, A," but Compliance Analyst is marked "I" instead of "C," and Treasury Ops is "I" as in the ground truth. Compliance Officer is "I" incorrectly, should be "–".
  - For "KYC Review," Compliance Analyst is "R, A" (correct), but Compliance Officer is "I" incorrectly (should be "C"), and Front-Office Analyst is "C" in the ground truth but "C" in LLM answer (correct).
  - For "AML Screening," Compliance Analyst is "R, A" (correct), Front-Office Analyst is marked "I" (should be "–"), Compliance Officer "I" instead of "C".
  - For "Risk Scoring," Compliance Analyst is "R, A" (should be only R), Compliance Officer is "I" (should be "A"), Front-Office Analyst "I" (should be "C").
  - For "Compliance Officer Approval," assignments are similar (almost correct; but C and I for Compliance Analyst/Front-Office Analyst are inverted).
  - "Schedule Payment" is not in ground truth; this step should not exist.
  - "Release Funds and Notify Originating Analyst" assigns "R, A" as in ground truth, but includes notification as an explicit activity.
- **Formatting:** Markdown table is correct.

**Summary:**  
No vocabulary errors are present, which is good. However, several RACI codes differ from the ground truth, and extra/merged activities are present, violating the requirement to not add or merge. Each of these discrepancies reflects a significant but not catastrophic error, so a strict 3-point penalty (from 10 to 7) is justified, with multiple smaller assignment mismatches further reinforcing the loss in points.
