The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, structure (No followed by justification citing exact same cases C003 and C005 with identical line numbers 6/7 and 11), and reasoning: both identify the reversal in C003 and absence of Receive_Order in C005 as counterexamples disproving "always follows." No factual errors, omissions, or inaccuracies; minor phrasing/styling differences (e.g., bolding, "precedes" vs. "first/afterwards," paragraph vs. bullets) do not alter meaning or violate the "one paragraph" instruction, warranting no point loss under strict evaluation focused on fidelity to facts and log verification.
