The LLM answer is accurate, correctly stating that the computation is impossible due to a lack of data, both for the requested metrics and their statistical estimates. It also specifies that the SLA information and historical KPIs do not allow for the calculation, which is clear and on-point.

Minor deductions:
- The LLM's use of “neither can the standard deviation or the 95% confidence interval” is slightly less precise than the ground truth's direct mention that neither metric nor its dispersion/confidence interval can be calculated “without concrete times for any ‘Approve Invoice’ execution.”
- The LLM's phrasing is slightly more verbose and indirect compared to the crispness of the ground truth answer.

Otherwise, all essential information and reasoning are correctly captured.
