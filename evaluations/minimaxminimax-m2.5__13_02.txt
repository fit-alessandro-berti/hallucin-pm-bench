**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the deterministic ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and rounding (2.08%, 8.33%). Question 3 is ≤100 words (64 words), explicitly mentions the single occurrence ("only once"), notes variance/instability (skewed metrics, overfitting to rare pattern), and cautions against over-generalization ("do not generalize to the full population"). No inventions, adheres to log data only, minor approximations (≈2%, ≈8%) are contextual and non-contradictory after stating exact figures in Q2. Structure is clear and precise.
