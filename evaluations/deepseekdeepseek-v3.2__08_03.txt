The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (matching ground truth "Yes"), accurately explains the shortcut via T2b allowing pd without T3 or pc (matches), and provides the correct minimal prefix firing sequence T1 → T2b → T4 → T5 (or permuted T4/T2b) to enable and fire T5 without prior T3 firing, which is the shortest to demonstrate T5 firing "before" T3 under a strict reading of reaching a marking where T5 fires with no prior T3 (length 4, aligning with ground truth's noted "lower bound of four transitions"). 

However, strict evaluation reveals significant differences penalizing the score:
- **Sequence mismatch**: Provides length-4 sequence stopping at T5 (demonstrating possibility without T3 firing at all), while ground truth provides length-6 sequence explicitly including T6 → T3 afterward to show T3 firing *after* T5, claiming it as "*minimal*" and "shortest [...] that achieves this order". LLM explicitly notes "T3 never fires" (true for its sequence but diverging from ground truth's demonstration of both firing with order).
- **No markings**: Ground truth includes detailed step-by-step markings (e.g., "p0 → pa + pb     marking: pa 1, pb 1"); LLM omits entirely (-1.0).
- **Shortness claim**: LLM calls length 4 "shortest"; ground truth acknowledges bound 4 but asserts full 6-step as minimal due to "T6 [...] required [...] adding the two extra steps" (-0.5).
- **Explanation depth/format**: LLM brief (~100 words, paragraph + bullets); ground truth structured (bold yes, code-block sequence, "Why this works" section, formal proof no shorter, conclusion with ⟨sequence⟩) (-1.0).
- **Minor extras**: LLM adds alternative sequence order (valid, but not in ground truth); no mention of feedback loop necessity for post-T5 T3.

Core logic/sequence prefix identical (80% overlap), correct yes + enabling path, but format, completeness, and interpretation of "shortest sequence demonstrating order" (omitting post-T5 steps) cause deductions. No factual errors, but lacks ground truth's full detail/proof.
