The LLM answer is highly accurate and captures the core reasoning from the ground truth, including the impossibility due to missing timestamps and reliance on counts alone, with equivalent explanation of why durations cannot be calculated. Minor deductions for slight phrasing variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," omission of "duration information," and "activity occurrence counts" vs. "event counts") and not explicitly restating "average cycle time" in the response, per strict evaluation criteria.
