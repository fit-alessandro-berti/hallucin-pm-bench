### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is mostly accurate in identifying the reversed order of "Authorize_Refund" and "Update_Inventory" in Cases 1001 and 1003, correctly concluding that the fact is not supported. It provides a clear, case-by-case justification with timestamps, aligning well with the prompt's request for short justification citing case IDs and activities.

However, under strict evaluation:
- **Key error on Case 1002**: The LLM states the fact "cannot be directly assessed" and "doesn't contradict," which is incorrect. The ground truth correctly notes that the absence of "Update_Inventory" disproves the "always" claim, as the universal quantifier fails without the expected sequence occurring in every case. This softens the analysis and misses a core logical implication, warranting a significant deduction (e.g., -2.0 points).
- **Minor issues**: The LLM does not explicitly address the "immediately before" aspect (though the order reversal makes it moot) and lacks the ground truth's precise line citations or emphasis that the sequence never occurs as claimed in *any* case. Phrasing is slightly less conclusive ("not supported" vs. "false/inaccurate").
- No fabrication or guessing beyond data, but the Case 1002 handling introduces a meaningful deviation from the ground truth's rigor.

Overall, strong structure and evidence use, but the analytical gap on "always" prevents a higher score.
