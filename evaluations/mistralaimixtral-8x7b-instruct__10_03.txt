**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (+1.0 partial)**: Uses the exact mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks. No disallowed terms appear.
- **Table format (partial, +0.5)**: Valid Markdown table with all 4 roles as columns. However, uses full words ("**Responsible**") instead of standard RACI abbreviations (R/A/C/I) as in ground truth; empty cells obscure involvement (vs. explicit –, C, I).
- **Activities (-4.0 major violation)**: Adds 8 unauthorized activities ("Intake Vetting approval", etc., "Payment scheduling", "Notification") not described or consolidated as in ground truth. Prompt forbids adding activities; invents fragmented approvals/scheduling/review unrelated to narrative. Ground truth has exactly 6 precise activities covering narrative without excess.
- **RACI assignments (-3.5 major)**: No matches to ground truth even for shared 4 activities:
  | Activity | LLM | Ground Truth | Diff |
  |----------|-----|--------------|------|
  | Intake Vetting | Front R only | Front **R,A**; Comp C; Treas I | Misses A/C/I |
  | KYC Review | Comp R only | Comp **R,A**; Officer C; Treas I | Misses A/C/I |
  | AML Screening | Comp R only | Comp **R,A**; Officer C; Treas I | Misses A/C/I |
  | Risk Scoring | Comp R; Officer A | Front C; Comp R; Officer **A**; Treas I | Misses C/I; no Front |
  - Extra rows have invented assignments (e.g., "Payment approval" Officer A/Treas I ≠ GT's consolidated).
- **Coverage of narrative/roles (-1.0)**: Fails to cover "every activity and role described" accurately (e.g., no consolidated "Compliance Officer Approval"; ignores Consulted/Informed for low-risk path; "Notification" incomplete).
- **Overall**: Massive deviations in structure/content (12 vs. 6 rows, incomplete/wrong cells). Strict policy: even partial matches penalized heavily. Total reflects ~20% alignment (terms/table only).
