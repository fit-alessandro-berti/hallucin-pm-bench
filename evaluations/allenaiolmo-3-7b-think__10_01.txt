### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Vocabulary (perfect, +2.0 points)**: Uses exact mandated terms (**KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance**) with correct capitalization/bolding on KYC; no forbidden terms.
- **Structure (+0.5 partial)**: Correct activities as rows, roles as columns (abbreviations acceptable per role list, but full names in GT = minor deduction). Markdown table format similar.
- **RACI Allocations (0.0 - major failure)**: Vast differences vs. GT:
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | All rows | Blanks instead of C/I; no I anywhere (GT has many); combined "RA" vs. **R / A** or separate A/R. |
  | Receive Application | AM RA only (GT: AM **R/A**, CO C, FC/IT I). |
  | **KYC Review** | AM C + CO RA (GT: AM A, CO **R**, FC C, IT I). Wrong A/R swap. |
  | **Order Vetting** | AM RA only (GT: AM **R/A**, CO C, FC/IT I). |
  | Payment Clearance | FC RA only (GT: AM A, CO C, FC **R**, IT I). Wrong A. |
  | Record Update | IT RA only (GT: AM C, CO/FC I, IT **R**). Missing C/I. |
  | Notify Customer | AM RA only (GT: AM **R/A**, others I). |
  - No single Responsible per row consistently matching narrative/GT; AM not Accountable where GT specifies; ignores consultative/informed roles.
- **Unwarranted content (-0.5)**: Added title, **Key** (GT has none); claims "no roles marked as informed" (false vs. GT/narrative).
- **Formatting/Polish (0.0)**: No bolding on **Order Vetting**/**Payment Clearance**/key cells; "RA" vs. **R / A**; inconsistent spacing.
- **Overall**: ~80% structural/vocab match but core RACI purpose fails (wrong/incomplete per notes rubric). Strictness demands heavy penalty for content divergence.
