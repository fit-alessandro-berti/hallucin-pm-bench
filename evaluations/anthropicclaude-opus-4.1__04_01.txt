7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant and accurately pinpoints violations in Rules 2 and 3, aligning with the ground truth on the core conclusion and key justifications (e.g., reversed order in Rule 2, with `Risk_Assessment` after `Ship_Goods`; Rule 3 violation due to `Three_way_match` occurring too late after `Goods_Received`). It also implicitly affirms compliance for Rules 1, 4, and 5 through its per-rule analysis, which matches the ground truth's assessments.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Format deviations (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: The required format is strictly "“Compliant” or “Non-compliant”, followed by a numbered justification that cites the relevant rules." The LLM includes an unnecessary preamble analysis of all rules before delivering the answer, bloating the response beyond the concise format. Its justification lists only the two violations (numbered 1-2), whereas the ground truth provides a comprehensive numbered review of *all* five rules (1-5), explicitly stating "Satisfied" or "Violated" for each with citations. This makes the LLM's justification less complete and not fully mirroring the ground truth structure.
- **Factual error in Rule 3 distance calculation (significant deduction: -1.0 points)**: The LLM states "distance from #6 to #10 = 4 activities," while the ground truth specifies "distance = 3." This discrepancy in quantifying the distance (likely stemming from differing conventions: LLM counts position offset as 4; ground truth uses intervening events as 3) introduces a small but precise error. Even though both correctly deem it a violation exceeding the ≤2 limit and "next two activities" window (events 7-8), the mismatch in the cited number reflects inaccuracy against the ground truth.
- Minor positives offset some loss: Citations to rules, events, and roles are precise and relevant; no major factual errors beyond the distance; overall logic and compliance conclusion are identical.

Total: Starting from 10.0 for perfect match, deductions for differences yield 7.5. The answer is strong in substance but penalized heavily for format extras and the quantifiable error per instructions.
