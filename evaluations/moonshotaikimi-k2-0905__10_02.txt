4.0

The LLM answer does incorporate the enforced vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and presents a clearly organized RACI table in Markdown, but there are multiple significant issues compared to the ground truth:

**Major Issues:**
1. **Missing Role:** The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely, which is present (and necessary) in the ground truth. The ground truth assigns "Accountable" ("A") to the Operations Manager for every stepâ€”this is critical in the RACI model.
2. **Task Mismatch & Redundancy:** The LLM answer introduces additional steps (such as "Notify Regulatory Liaison that case is archived") and splits some activities (e.g., sending SWIFT is separated from "Release Payment") that are not discretely listed in the ground truth. This complicates mapping and creates redundancy.
3. **Assignment Mismatches:** 
   - Several roles are assigned differently (e.g., "Approve high-risk transaction" is assigned only to "A" (Regulatory Liaison) in LLM answer, not "R", while the ground truth has both A and R assigned in various places).
   - Consultation and information links differ from the ground truth (e.g., "C" and "I" placements).
4. **Mandated Vocabulary Application:** The LLM answer generally adheres to the enforced synonyms, but in some places uses verbatim task language from the prompt (e.g., "Perform KYC Review") instead of the standardised "KYC Review" activity as in the ground truth.

**Minor Issues:**
- The legend is missing (R = Responsible, etc.).
- The tasks are not named with identical rigor/standard format as requested (e.g., "Archive Record" vs. "Archive case file").

Given the critical omission of the Operations Manager, misalignment in task definitions, stray steps, and several assignment mismatches, this answer would be penalized severely in a professional setting where strict adherence to the process and terminology is paramount.

Thus, the answer merits a score of **4.0**.
