3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary mandate (e.g., correctly uses "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", and "Regulatory Liaison" without substitutions), which earns minimal credit. However, it deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, content, and accuracy, warranting severe deductions under strict criteria:

- **Structural Errors (major loss: -4.0 points)**: The LLM introduces an unnecessary "#" column, a title not present in the ground truth, and uses "—" for empty cells instead of filling all roles with R/A/C/I as in the ground truth. No separate "Legend" is included, unlike the ground truth.

- **Task Mapping and Completeness (major loss: -2.0 points)**: The LLM expands the 6 informal steps into 8 tasks, incorrectly splitting step 5 (release + SWIFT send) and step 6 (archive + notify) into separate rows, adding unmandated granularity (e.g., "Send SWIFT message", "Notify Regulatory Liaison"). This omits faithful mapping to the source text. Task phrasings are verbose and not concise/mapped as in ground truth (e.g., LLM: "Receive customer’s transfer instruction and log in system" vs. GT: "Receive Payment Instruction"; no bolding for "KYC Review").

- **Roles (major loss: -1.0 points)**: Omits "Operations Manager" (present in all ground truth rows for accountability), limiting to only 3 roles instead of 4. This ignores implied process oversight roles derived from the description.

- **RACI Assignments (major loss: -3.0 points)**: Assignments are inaccurate and inconsistent with ground truth across all tasks. Examples:
  - Task 1 (Receive): LLM (R Analyst, I Liaison, — IT) vs. GT (R Analyst, I Liaison, A Operations, C IT).
  - Task 3 (KYC): LLM (C Analyst, R Liaison, — IT) vs. GT (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Operations, I IT) – missing A and wrong IT.
  - No alignment for high-risk approval (LLM row 4: A Liaison only, but GT integrates A Operations).
  - Extra LLM tasks (6-8) have no ground truth equivalents, fabricating assignments (e.g., row 8: I/A/R arbitrarily).

- **Minor Formatting/Compliance (minor loss: -0.5 points)**: Lacks the ground truth's header "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" and explanatory note below the table. While Markdown is used, it's not "clearly organised" per the prompt due to extras.

Overall, the answer covers the process but introduces errors, inventions, and mismatches that fail to "map every step... without omissions or substitutions," resulting in low fidelity to the ground truth. A perfect score requires near-identical replication.
