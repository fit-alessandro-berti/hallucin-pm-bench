### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM incorrectly identifies and summarizes four "decision points," but the ground truth specifies only two true decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate). The inclusions of "Assign-Deck-Reviewer" and "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" as decision points are errors, as they are procedural steps without conditional branching or gating rules. The summaries for the two valid points are mostly accurate but not phrased as concisely or precisely as the ground truth (e.g., TriVote phrasing omits the "record 'Approve'" detail and doesn't emphasize advancement only on two approvals). This results in major inaccuracies, warranting a low score for this section (~3.0 equivalent).
- **Part (b)**: The list is incomplete and imprecise. It misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (explicitly listed in step 8 of the process). The three scorecards are grouped as a single item rather than listed separately in first-appearance order, reducing the count from 9 (ground truth) to effectively 6 items. All other documents are correctly ordered and identified, with no hallucinations (e.g., no invalid KYC/AML mentions). This partial completeness earns moderate credit (~5.0 equivalent).
- **Overall**: Strict assessment penalizes the structural errors in (a) and omissions/grouping in (b) heavily, as even small deviations (e.g., extra/missing items) indicate significant divergence from the ground truth. No credit for extraneous details or formatting.
