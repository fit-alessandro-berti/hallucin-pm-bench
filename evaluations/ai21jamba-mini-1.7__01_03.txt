6.0

**Review and Justification:**

### a) Decision Points

- **Error 1:** The LLM answer incorrectly lists "Assign-Deck-Reviewer" as a decision point (step 1 in its answer a), while this is a procedural step, not a decision point per the prompt and process definition.
- **Error 2:** The Tri-Color-Risk-Check step itself is listed as a decision point. While it determines the risk rating (which is later used in a conditional branch), the actual decision point is the conditional skip/check immediately after, not the risk check itself.
- **Error 3:** The LLM correctly identifies and describes the conditional skip after risk check, though it is embedded as a "Conditional Skip (Step 4)"—but could be stated more precisely and strictly as a distinct branch based on the process.
- **Error 4 (minor):** The TriVote gate is correctly described in terms of the rule and participants, but it lacks the statement that “Sustainability Officer” participation is always mandatory (though this is minor given the rule's wording).

**→ Points lost for polluting the list with process steps that are not true decision points, and for not being sufficiently concise/focused on the true decision logic.**

### b) Document List

- **Error 1:** The list omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (should appear after "Offer Sheet 77" and before "ID Matrix Declaration"). This is a clear, explicit omission: the ground truth lists 9 documents, the LLM answer lists only 8 by skipping "Signed Offer Sheet 77".
- **Error 2:** The LLM answer needlessly groups the three scorecards as one item ("Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow") instead of listing them separately as the ground truth does.
- **Error 3 (minor):** The answer properly omits prohibited/hallucinated documents, which is correct.

**→ Points lost for missing a required document explicitly listed in the process, and improper grouping/ordering of items.**

---

**Overall:**

The answer is accurate on the existence and general rules of the key decision points and documents, but with very notable technical errors: false positive decision points, merged/grouped/omitted documents. These are significant flaws given the strictness required.

**Thus, 6.0 is fair—solid comprehension, but with substantial technical errors that preclude a higher score.**
