**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major deficiencies, ~60% of prompt weight)**: Ground truth identifies **3 distinct decision points** with precise locations, branching logic, and outcomes (eligibility rejection, amount threshold, approval/rejection). LLM identifies **only 1** (amount threshold, partial credit for accurate description), explicitly claiming it as the "one explicit decision point" (incorrect; ignores implicit decisions in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** validation and approval steps in **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**/**Senior_Auditor_Review**, per process "checks," "signs off," "succeeded," and constraints). No mention of rejection paths or "final payment approval." Misses ~2/3 points → severe penalty (-4.0 equivalent).
- **Required Documents (minor strengths)**: Lists all **7 exact documents** matching ground truth (full credit). Correctly notes *AuditTrail* conditional ("only for high-value claims," aligns with "part of the catalogue"). No extras introduced (complies with prompt). Structure as bullet list vs. ground truth numbered list minor → negligible deduction (-0.3).
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity**: LLM uses bold sections/bullets (functional but not table/numbered as ground truth). Concise but incomplete/ inaccurate on core "every decision point" requirement. No hallucinations, but omissions are factual errors per process inference. Strict scaling: 10.0=perfect match; each missed decision=-2.0; minor format=-0.6 → **4.2**.
