The LLM answer is semantically and factually identical to the ground truth in content, correctly answering all three questions with precise matches on case count (3, with accurate listing), preceding activity (Pack_Items), and unique activity (Cancel_Order). Minor formatting variations (e.g., numbering as "1." vs "A1", bullet "-" vs "*", "distinct" inclusion which aligns with prompt wording, lack of markdown escape on underscore) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they preserve conciseness, bullet-point structure, and exact prompt compliance without deviations in meaning or accuracy.
