8.0

The LLM answer accurately identifies that the fact is false and uses examples from the cases to justify the response. It correctly notes that in Cases 1001 and 1003, "Update_Inventory" happens before "Authorize_Refund," and that Case 1002 lacks "Update_Inventory" entirely, thus refuting the "always" aspect of the claim.

However, compared to the ground truth answer, there are minor shortcomings:

- The LLM answer does not explicitly mention the absence of any case in which "Authorize_Refund" immediately precedes "Update_Inventory," as the ground truth does for full clarity.
- The LLM answer does not explicitly label its verdict or cite line numbers, making the logic slightly less rigorous and traceable.
- The justification could be clearer by breaking down its reasoning for each case, mirroring the granular structure of the ground truth.

Despite these minor issues, the core reasoning is sound and well supported by the data, thus an 8.0 is warranted.
