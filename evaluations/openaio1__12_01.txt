The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in verdict (fact is false/inaccurate) and core justification (reversed order in cases 1001/1003; absence in 1002 disproves "always"). It correctly cites cases, activities, and evidence (timestamps enhance precision over ground truth's line numbers). Minor deductions for slightly less structured format (no bullets/verdict header) and not explicitly addressing "immediately precede" (though reversal implies it, and claim is fully disproved regardless). Strict evaluation: near-perfect but not identical phrasing/structure warrants small loss.
