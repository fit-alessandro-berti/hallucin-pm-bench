The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying the overall non-compliance due to Rule 3 violation while assessing all rules with precise reasoning aligned to the ground truth. Minor differences include phrasing variations (e.g., "both present" vs. "appears once" in Rule 1; bullet format vs. table) and slight wording tweaks (e.g., "violates rule 3" vs. "not compliant" in intro), but these do not alter the factual correctness or completeness. No substantive errors, though format mismatch warrants a small deduction under strict evaluation.
