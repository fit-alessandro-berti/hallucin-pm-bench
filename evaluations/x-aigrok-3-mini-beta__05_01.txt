The LLM answer proposes a similar pattern (interrupting boundary timer directly to Task_Triage for escalation) but attaches it to the wrong task (Task_Check instead of Task_Receive), which fails to accurately measure from submission (Start_Claim) and risks exceeding the 48-hour SLA if time elapses before Task_Check begins. It also lacks the ground truth's emphasis on bypassing document requests and uses a less precise duration description, though it stays in plain English and under word limit. This core placement error and incomplete rationale warrant a significant deduction under strict evaluation.
