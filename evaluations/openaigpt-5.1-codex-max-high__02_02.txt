10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, sequence, distinct items, alphabetical order, and adherence to "one per line" for Q3. No hallucinations, extras, missing elements, or factual errors. Minor formatting variations (e.g., **Q1** vs **A1**, no dashes in Q3 list, absence of markdown escapes in activity names) do not constitute errors under line-by-line factual precision criteria, as they preserve the required output semantics.
