The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in identifying the core issue (lack of timestamps preventing cycle time calculation) and adheres to the prompt's requirement for a single concise explanatory sentence, with only minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; omission of "duration information" and "event counts" specifics) that do not alter meaning or accuracy.
