### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth. Quantification of SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s) is accurate and grounded in the table data (900 vs. 600, 600 vs. 300, 300 vs. 240). The memo is approximately 150 words and focuses only on table-provided elements without extraneous inventions like total cases.
  
- **Major weaknesses (significant deductions)**: 
  - **Invented metrics**: Recommends specific reduction targets (50%, 25%, 10%) not present in the data, violating the core instruction to "ground every sentence in the data; do NOT invent...metrics." The ground truth avoids per-action invented numbers, tying recommendations to process details instead. This alone warrants a severe penalty under strict evaluation.
  - **Vague, non-data-driven recommendations**: Actions (e.g., "streamlined document review," "automated risk assessment tools," "optimize credit scoring") are generic and not concretely tied to table data (e.g., no reference to cases, throughput/waiting specifics beyond restatement). Ground truth provides precise, actionable steps (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst") that feel more derived from process analysis, even if projecting an end-to-end impact.
  - **Format violations**: Uses bullet points for activity identification (e.g., listing activities with details), but the prompt specifies "bullet points only for the recommendations." Ground truth uses bold/paragraphs for analysis and bullets solely for recs. Memo structure adds informal elements ("Dear COO," "Best regards") absent in the ground truth's formal "To/From/Subject" style, deviating from executive memo norms.
  - **Minor issues compounding strictness**: Lacks the ground truth's holistic context (e.g., tying to overall bottlenecks or projected impact), making it feel less comprehensive. No small errors overlookedâ€”each (e.g., bullet misuse) deducts noticeably.

Overall, while core analysis aligns, the inventions, vagueness, and format errors create substantial differences, justifying a low-mid score.
