**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (full credit)**: Perfect correctness on top 3 activities ranked by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). Quotes both avg and 95th percentile verbatim (minor formatting diffs like "36.5h" vs "36.5 h" ignored as insignificant). No unwarranted content (no service times, throughput, other activities). Memo ≤150 words (123). No criminal/offensive issues.
- **Weaknesses (major deductions, per strictness)**: 
  - Actions are concrete/relevant but **not data-driven** (no pilots, estimates, tests, or data citations as in ground truth; generic suggestions only).
  - **Not all actions promise ≥20% cut** explicitly (#1 yes, #2/#3 only imply "expedite/faster" – violates prompt per activity).
  - Significant differences from ground truth: different structure/format (verbose memo with title/summary/closing vs crisp #1-#3 list), completely different actions, less precise phrasing (e.g., "95th: 120h" vs "p95 120 h"), extra phrasing ("most extreme... bottlenecks", closing sentence).
- **Overall**: Passes core facts (8-9 range) but loses ~3 pts on action quality/specificity, data-driven claim, and GT dissimilarity. Utmost strictness applied; small shortfalls (e.g., incomplete % promises) cost 0.5+ pts each.
