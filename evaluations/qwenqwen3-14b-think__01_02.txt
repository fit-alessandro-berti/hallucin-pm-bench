8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)) using exact activity names from the prompt, without introducing standard loan terminology. It also accurately lists all six required documents, matching the prompt's phrasing more closely than the ground truth in several details (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's abbreviated "≤ 3 months"; inclusion of "single pay-stub or tax slip" and "(CIS) template"). However, under strict evaluation:

- **Decision Points (significant deductions for omissions and minor inaccuracies)**:
  - Underwriter Alignment Gate: Omits context of it being "after the Dual Underwriter Split" and specific underwriter names ("Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B"), reducing precision (-1.0). Uses "Determine if... differ by ≤ 2 points" vs. ground truth's conditional phrasing with "⇒ continue" and "tie-break" (-0.5).
  - Amount Threshold Decision: Omits "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" context (-1.0). Uses "Auto-approve loans < €15 000" (introduces "loans" instead of "amount"; omits "system") and "escalate to" instead of "send to" or ground truth's "proceed to" (-0.5).
  - Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA): Adds extraneous "for loans ≥ €15 000" (accurate but not in ground truth's concise phrasing); minor capitalization mismatch ("approve or reject" vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**") (-0.5).
  - Overall structure: Lacks ground truth's explicit flow indicators and italicized conditions, making the summary less contextual (-0.5).

- **Required Documents (minor deductions)**:
  - List is complete and exact in items, with formatting (bullets vs. numbered) as a neutral stylistic difference (0 deduction).
  - Phrasing is closer to the prompt than ground truth in some cases (no deduction), but omits ground truth's optional clarifying note on exclusions (not required by the user prompt, so minimal impact: -0.2).
  - Ground truth abbreviates unnecessarily (e.g., omits "Latest", "single", "template"), so LLM scores higher here relative to prompt fidelity.

Total deductions: -4.0 from 10.0, resulting in 8.0. The answer is strong in fidelity to the prompt but loses points for missing flow context and exact conditional details, per strict criteria.
