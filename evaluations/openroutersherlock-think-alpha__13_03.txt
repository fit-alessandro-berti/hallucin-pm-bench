7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1 (Score: 10.0)**: Exact match to ground truth ("1"), correctly counts the single occurrence of “Manual Fraud Check” in case 1002. No differences.
- **Part 2 (Score: 6.0)**: Concise (78 words ≤120) and captures core idea of small sample size leading to misestimation (e.g., tiny fraction, high variance, potential over/underestimation). Aligns on non-representative snippet (early hours, incomplete traces noted as a valid observation). However, significant deductions for: (1) factual error (15 events vs. ground truth's 14, a small but strict violation per instructions); (2) omission of key ground truth elements like frequency swing (0% to 7% via events, wide confidence interval, rare-event sampling error); (3) no mention of near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) and string-matching pitfalls, a distinctive analytical insight; (4) shifts focus to case-based % (33%) vs. ground truth's event-based (7%), introducing divergence. Adds unemphasized details (e.g., non-random selection) but stays data-bound. Overall, ~50% overlap in reasoning depth, penalizing incompleteness strictly.
- **Composite**: Weighted average (equal parts), strict holistic assessment penalizes differences proportionally.
