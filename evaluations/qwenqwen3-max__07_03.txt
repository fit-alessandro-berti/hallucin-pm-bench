The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the two gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with no extras, omissions, or commentary, fully matching the content and structure of the ground truth. Minor formatting differences (absence of bullet points and alignment spacing in the ground truth) result in a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria, but do not affect the substantive accuracy.
