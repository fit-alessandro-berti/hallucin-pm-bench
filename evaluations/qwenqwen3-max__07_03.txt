8.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, as well as both gateway type changes. However, the formatting does not strictly match:

- It omits bullet points ("-") in all three sections, whereas the ground truth includes them.
- In the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section, the spacing differs (the ground truth aligns the gateway names for clarity, and includes an extra space before the gateway name in the second item).
- The LLM does not add the required dash at the start of each item.

These details are small but, per instructions, even minor errors should result in a significant loss of points. The functional content is otherwise correct, so an 8.5 is appropriate.
