9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment, both exclusive → parallel), matching the ground truth content verbatim in terms of listed elements, IDs, names, and change descriptions. No extraneous commentary or unchanged elements are mentioned, adhering to the prompt's constraints. However, minor formatting discrepancies result in a deduction: the ground truth uses bullet points ("-") for all list items, while the LLM answer presents items as plain lines without bullets; additionally, the ground truth includes alignment spaces in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"), which are absent in the LLM answer. Under utmost strictness, these small presentation differences warrant a 1.0-point loss, as the output must closely mirror the ground truth structure for perfect alignment.
