9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 correctly ranked by avg waiting time (36.5 → 12.2 → 7.8). Both avg and 95p quoted verbatim from table (e.g., 120.0h, 44.0h, 16.4h).
- **No unwarranted content**: No service-time/throughput mentioned. No invented metrics. Minor ding (-0.3): Brief reference to "Submit_Claim" in #1 action (another table activity, logically tied to process flow but violates "no other activities" per scoring notes/ground truth note).
- **Action relevance**: All 3 concrete, logically data-driven (e.g., #1 targets 95p long tail; #2 infers batching from variance; #3 addresses queues). Each explicitly promises ≥20% cut, process-focused. Strong, but different from ground truth specifics ("pilot tests"/estimates cited) and slightly more verbose (-0.3); no unsupported data invented.
- **Format/structure**: Crisp memo format (<100 words, well under 150). Ranked #1→#3 clearly. Minor diffs from ground truth minimalism (header/bolding "p95th pct" vs "p95", "h" spacing) cost -0.2 under strictness.
- **Overall**: Extremely close to ground truth criteria; core flawless, small extraneous mention/format variances deduct precisely.
