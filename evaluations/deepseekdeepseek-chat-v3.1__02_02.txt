10.0

The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content, sequence, and alphabetical ordering for all questions. Minor formatting differences in Q3 presentation (plain lines vs. bulleted list) do not constitute errors, as the prompt specifies "one per line" without mandating bullets. No hallucinations, omissions, or inaccuracies are present.
