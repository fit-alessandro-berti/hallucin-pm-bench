The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth for all three questions:

- Q1: Correctly identifies the number of distinct cases (3).
- Q2: Accurately gives the sequence of activities for case C002 in correct order with correct separator.
- Q3: Lists the distinct immediate predecessors to "Ship_Order" (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), one per line and in alphabetical order.

The logical reasoning and references to the log are correct, and there are no missing, extraneous, or fabricated elements. No errors are present, even minor ones. Strictly applying the evaluation criteria, this deserves a perfect score.
