5.0

**Justification:**

**Vocabulary Adherence:**  
The answer does maintain strict vocabulary discipline—none of the forbidden synonyms (“Preliminary Assessment”, etc.) appear. All four mandated terms are used exactly as specified.

**Major Issues:**

1. **Activities Mismatched/Naming Errors:**
   - The LLM answer introduces activity names *not present* in the ground truth:
     - “Approval (for high-risk cases)” instead of "Compliance Officer Approval"
     - “Payment Execution” instead of "Release Funds"
     - “Notification” (which is not an activity in the Process Narrative—notification is a notification step, not a main process activity as per the ground truth).
   - The LLM answer adds an extra activity (“Notification”) not required, and merges or alters activities, which the instruction explicitly forbids.

2. **RACI Assignment Errors:**
   - For every activity, the roles marked as R, A, C, I differ from the ground truth, sometimes by both omission and misplacement.
   - The LLM answer regularly makes the *same person* both Responsible and Accountable (R/A), but does so indiscriminately for several steps where the ground truth separates R, A, C, I more granularly.
   - E.g. "Risk Scoring": ground truth assigns R to Compliance Analyst and A to Compliance Officer, but the answer gives both R/A to Compliance Analyst (losing the correct accountability assignment).
   - "Compliance Officer Approval" is not named correctly and the assignments differ ("Approval (for high-risk cases)": R/A for Officer and I for Front-Office Analyst and Treasury Ops, which only partly matches the ground truth).

3. **Table Format Deviations:**
   - "–" is never used to mark non-involvement, despite instruction.
   - The matrix does not repeat "R, A" as in ground truth; instead it uses "R/A", which is not equivalent and not in the sample format.

**Minor Issues:**

- The activities’ order and composition don’t exactly follow the ground truth. 
- Additional explanation ("Legend") at the bottom is surplus: not included in instructions and ground truth.

**Good Points:**

- Only allowed vocabulary is used—no synonym leakage.
- Every role does appear per instruction.
- Markdown table format is respected.

**Overall:**  
- Serious issues with activity naming, scope, and RACI assignment.
- Good discipline on vocabulary.
- Thus, **5.0**: Demonstrates understanding and discipline with vocabulary, but structural and RACI errors warrant a significant penalty.
