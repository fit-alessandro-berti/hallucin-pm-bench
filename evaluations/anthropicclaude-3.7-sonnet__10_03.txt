4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the strict vocabulary policy by using only the four authorized terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms from the narrative. This is a strong point, earning some credit. However, under utmost strictness, the evaluation reveals significant flaws in activity identification, naming, merging/adding, and RACI assignments, leading to a low score. Small errors (e.g., format inconsistencies) compound the deductions.

#### Key Errors and Point Losses
1. **Activities (Major Issue: -3.5 points)**:
   - The prompt mandates covering **every activity** from the narrative without renaming, merging, or adding. The narrative describes: (1) Preliminary Assessment (Intake Vetting), (2) CDD (KYC Review), (3) Sanctions Check (AML Screening), (4) risk rating derivation (Risk Scoring), (5) escalation/approval for high-risk cases (Compliance Officer Approval), (6) scheduling/approval-based release of funds (Release Funds, including execution and notification to originating analyst).
   - Ground truth accurately maps to 6 activities: Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring, Compliance Officer Approval, Release Funds.
   - LLM incorrectly adds "Notification" as a separate activity (not distinctly described; it's part of Treasury Ops' release step). Renames "Approval (for high-risk cases)" (vague and adds parenthetical not in ground truth; should be "Compliance Officer Approval"). Renames "Payment Execution" (does not match ground truth's "Release Funds"; appears to merge execution but excludes notification handling). This violates "do not rename, merge, or add," creating 3 mismatched rows instead of precise coverage.

2. **RACI Assignments (Major Issue: -4.0 points)**:
   - Multiple per-row discrepancies, with even minor shifts (e.g., I vs. – or C vs. I) treated as significant errors:
     - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst is C (ground) but I (LLM); Treasury Ops is I (ground) but empty (LLM).
     - **KYC Review**: Front-Office Analyst is – (ground) but I (LLM); Treasury Ops is I (ground) but empty (LLM).
     - **AML Screening**: Same as KYC Review (Front I instead of –; Treasury empty instead of I).
     - **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office Analyst is C (ground) but I (LLM); Compliance Analyst is R (ground) but R/A (LLM, wrongly adds A); Compliance Officer is A (ground) but C (LLM); Treasury Ops is I (ground) but empty (LLM). This row is especially flawed.
     - **Approval**: Treasury Ops is – (ground) but I (LLM).
     - **Payment Execution/Release Funds**: Compliance Analyst is C (ground) but empty (LLM); Compliance Officer is C (ground) but I (LLM).
     - Added "Notification" row has no ground truth equivalent, rendering all assignments invalid.
   - Overall, ~70% of cells differ, with systematic under-assignment of I/C roles (e.g., empties where involvement is required) and incorrect A attributions.

3. **Formatting and Structure (Minor but Significant: -1.5 points)**:
   - Uses "R/A" shorthand instead of ground truth's "**R, A**" bolded format, which precisely indicates dual roles.
   - Adds unauthorized elements: Title ("# NimbusPay..."), legend (not requested; prompt specifies only "Markdown table"), and empty cells (ground uses "–" for no involvement).
   - No bolding on activities or R/A as in ground truth, reducing clarity and fidelity.
   - Table structure is mostly Markdown-compliant but includes parentheticals in headers (e.g., "Approval (for high-risk cases)"), violating "do not rename."

#### Strengths (+3.0 points baseline)
- Perfect vocabulary compliance (no synonyms, exact terms used).
- Attempts comprehensive coverage of roles (all four from roster included).
- Logical RACI intent in some rows (e.g., Compliance Analyst as R/A for core compliance steps).

The answer is partially useful but deviates substantially from the ground truth in core requirements, justifying a mid-low score. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, cumulative errors halve the potential.
