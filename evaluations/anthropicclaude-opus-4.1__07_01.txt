The LLM answer correctly identifies which tasks were added and removed, and notes the gateway type change. However, there are significant errors that warrant a substantial point deduction:

- It lists only the element ids ("check_vip", "generate_qr", "send_rma_label") instead of the element names with ids as specified in the prompt and shown in the ground truth (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)").
- It fails to follow the explicit formatting requirements: headwords/headings should be bold and results formatted as in the ground truth, but here, they are marked with bullets and lack proper formatting.
- In "Gateway type changes," it omits the bold formatting for gateway types and does not explicitly indicate the element's id in the structured way the ground truth does.
- The answer omits the statements "(No other differences should be reported.)" and the use of “(none)” where appropriate for empty categories, as instructed in the prompt (although in this case, that applies only if a category is empty).

These issues reflect non-trivial deviations from the prompt's strict instructions regarding format and phrasing and therefore result in a substantial loss of points, though the factual content is otherwise accurate.
