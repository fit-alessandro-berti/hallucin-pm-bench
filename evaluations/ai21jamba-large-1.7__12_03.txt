The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise justification focused on the counterexamples (C002 and C004), accurately citing the sequences from the log without extraneous information or errors. This directly addresses the task's requirements by disproving the "always" claim through relevant CaseIDs and sequences. It aligns closely with the ground truth's conclusion and key evidence, though it is less exhaustive (omitting explicit checks for C001/C003 where the rule holds), which prevents a perfect score under strict evaluation criteria emphasizing comprehensive matching.
