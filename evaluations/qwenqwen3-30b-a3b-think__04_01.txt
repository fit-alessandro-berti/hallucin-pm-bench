The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately pinpoints the violations in Rules 2 and 3, matching the ground truth on these core issues. However, it deducts points for significant incompleteness: it omits any evaluation of Rules 1, 4, and 5 (which the ground truth confirms as satisfied), failing to provide a comprehensive numbered justification for the full rule set as implied by the prompt. Additionally, a minor but notable error in Rule 3 wording—"4 activities after" versus the ground truth's precise "distance = 3" (aligning with the rule's "distance ≤2" phrasing)—warrants further deduction under strict criteria, as it introduces ambiguity in counting despite the intent being clear.
