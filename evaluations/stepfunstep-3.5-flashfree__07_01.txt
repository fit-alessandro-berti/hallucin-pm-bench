**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact factual changes (added: `check_vip`, `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). Structure matches required headings closely, using bold and bullets. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Added/Removed tasks**: Major differences—lists only raw IDs (exact strings from XML `id` attributes), omitting descriptive `name` attributes + `(id = ``id`)` format as in ground truth. This is a significant content deviation (not minor formatting).
- **Gateway type changes**: Close but differs in phrasing ("`gw_valid`: exclusiveGateway (v1) → inclusiveGateway (v2)" vs "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), missing backticks and bolding.
- Minor: Bullet style (• vs *); no closing note; headings lack leading • from prompt spec (though ground truth also omits).

Factual accuracy perfect (no extras/speculation), but textual/content mismatches vs. ground truth warrant substantial deduction (~50% off perfect score).
