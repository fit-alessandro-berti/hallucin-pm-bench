7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) and quotes the required metrics verbatim. It stays within 150 words and avoids discussing service times, throughput, or other activities.

However, deductions for:
- Actions: Only two explicitly tie to â‰¥20% waiting-time reduction (via errors/backlog proxies); the third (Send_Closure_Letter) lacks any percentage, violating the per-activity requirement. Actions are concrete but less "data-driven" than ground truth (no pilots/estimates; more generic).
- Unwarranted content: Introduces "waiting-time costs," invented "80% of 95th-percentile," and "*Issue:*" explanations, adding fluff beyond the crisp format. Full memo structure and attachments exceed ground truth's minimalism, diluting focus.
- Minor: Ranks "by severity" instead of strictly "by waiting-time"; rationale repeats exclusions unnecessarily.

Overall, strong on core facts but loses points for imprecision and extras under strict criteria.
