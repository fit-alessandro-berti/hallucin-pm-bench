5.0

**Justification:**

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM answer lists only 2 explicit decision points:
   1. Underwriter Alignment Gate
   2. Amount Threshold Decision

- It completely omits the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a *decision point*, which is explicit in the ground truth.

- The LLM's description of the Underwriter Alignment Gate is correct, though slightly less precise than the ground truth.

- The Amount Threshold Decision is presented, but its dependent step (“if ≥ €15 000, proceed to board approval”) is not detailed—rather, the LLM says “a decision is made whether further approval from the Micro-loan Board is required,” less precise and missing the clear “board votes approve/reject” as its own critical decision point.

**Required Documents:**
- The LLM lists all required documents, but adds editorializing:
   - It describes the Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet as possibly not needed at submission—the prompt clearly requires it at submission, not just generated later.
   - Adds a non-required "system prompt" note about when documents are requested, which is not faithful to the ground truth answer format.

- Orders and names in the list are generally correct.

**Terminology:**
- The LLM mostly uses the correct terminology, but "board votes approve or reject" is missing. Also, mentioning "submission" in editorial notes instead of simply listing the required docs reflects deviation from the format.

**Conclusion:**
Major deduction for missing a third (and critical) decision point, and for editorializing/uncertainty on required documents which reflects lack of precision required in this strict setting. No outright fabrication, and activity names were largely followed (no standard loan terms introduced), but lack of precision and completeness warrant a strict 5.0.
