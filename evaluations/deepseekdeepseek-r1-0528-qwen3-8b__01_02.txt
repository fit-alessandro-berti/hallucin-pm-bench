### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major deductions for incompleteness and vagueness)**: The ground truth identifies exactly three decision points with precise branching logic, positions in the process, and terminology (e.g., "≤ 2" difference, escalation to Harmonisation Committee, exact thresholds with actions like "system auto-approves" or "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval", and inclusion of MBA as a voting decision). The LLM answer omits the third point (Final Micro-loan Board Approval) entirely—a critical error. It also simplifies the first two without exact conditions (e.g., no mention of escalation or continuation paths; vague phrasing like "a decision is made based on whether... differ by 2 points or less" instead of the full if-else structure; ignores process position like "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). This results in ~60% coverage but with significant accuracy loss, warranting a harsh penalty under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents (deductions for hedging, extras, and minor inaccuracies)**: The ground truth provides a complete, numbered list of exactly six items with concise phrasing (e.g., "≤ 3 months", "pay-stub/tax slip", "CIS" without "template"). The LLM lists five but adds speculative notes doubting the Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet's status as "required at submission time" (contradicting the prompt and ground truth by calling it "not necessarily submitted upfront" and "implicit"—this is a substantive error). It also includes an irrelevant note about prompting during RMA, which introduces unsubstantiated process details not in the prompt or ground truth. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "≤ 3 months old", "single pay-stub or tax slip", "CIS template") are small errors but, per instructions, cause significant point loss. Omits the ground truth's clarifying note on exclusions (no standard docs). Overall, ~70% match but undermined by doubt and additions.

- **General Adherence**: The LLM uses some exact activity names but introduces casual phrasing ("Okay, operating strictly...") and bullet styles differing from ground truth's structured "####" headers and numbering. No introduction of standard terminology, which is positive, but overall brevity and speculation deviate from the prompt's demand for summary using "exactly the activity names" without extras. Strictness amplifies these flaws, preventing a higher score despite partial correctness.
