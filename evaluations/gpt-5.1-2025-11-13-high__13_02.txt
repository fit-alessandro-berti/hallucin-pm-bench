10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1, 2a, and 2b in values, calculations, and formatting precision (e.g., rounding to two decimals). For question 3, the response is concise (78 words), adheres to the ≤100-word limit, and fully satisfies the required elements: (i) explicitly notes single occurrence in one event/case; (ii) addresses variance/instability via dominance by one instance, unstable predictions, and non-systematic basis; (iii) cautions against over-generalization through risks of treating it as typical, overfitting, and misleading analyses. No inventions, errors, or deviations from the log data.
