**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b are identical in content, calculations, and formatting (minor presentation differences like bolding or spacing are irrelevant). For 3, the response is ≤100 words (78 words), explicitly notes the single occurrence ("only 1 occurrence"), addresses variance/instability (e.g., "distort... bias performance metrics... overfit to rare patterns"), and cautions against over-generalization ("if overgeneralized... fail to generalize... treated as representative rather than exceptional"). All criteria met with no inventions or errors; adheres strictly to supplied data.
