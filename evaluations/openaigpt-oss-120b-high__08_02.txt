The LLM answer is correct, complete, and closely aligns with the ground truth in content, logic, sequence, and reasoning. Minor formatting differences (e.g., backticks vs. numbering, labeling as "Answer 1" vs. "Q1") do not impact accuracy or completeness, warranting no deduction under strict evaluation.
