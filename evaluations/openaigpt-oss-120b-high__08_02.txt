**Score: 9.3**

The LLM answer is very accurate, clear, and gives a correct sequence and reasoning. Here is a detailed comparison and error analysis:

**Strengths:**
- **Q1 answer ("Yes")** is correct and well-justified.
- **Q2:** The minimal firing sequence given by the LLM matches the ground truth both in content and order: `T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5`.
- **Explanation:** Explains initial marking, each transition, and the logic for why T5 can fire before T3, including the marking `{P2, P5}` before T5 fires.
- States explicitly that T5 can fire while P2 is still present, i.e., before T3 could fire, matching the spirit of the ground truth.

**Weaknesses (justifying point deductions):**
- The LLM answer does not mention (as the ground truth answer does) that after firing T5, T3 becomes subsequently disabled because P2 is consumed. This is an important detail for fully justifying that T3 cannot fire **after** T5 in this firing sequence.
- LLM says "No shorter sequence can generate P5 without first using T2, T7 and T4." While correct, it's a mild rephrasing and less directly relating to Q2’s request for an explanation on the impossibility, compared to the ground truth’s clarity.
- The ground truth uses step-by-step marking notation, which adds precision but is omitted in the LLM's answer.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is nearly perfect, with only minor loss of detail concerning the subsequent disabling of T3, and the omission of stepwise marking notation. These small details merit a deduction, so the strict score is **9.3**.
