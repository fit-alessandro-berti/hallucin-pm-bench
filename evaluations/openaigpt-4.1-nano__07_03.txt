The LLM answer correctly identifies the ADDED TASKS and the change to Gateway_ReviewNeeded, but:

- It fails to list the REMOVED TASK Task_ManualReview (Manual Review), instead incorrectly stating "(none)".
- It omits the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGE for Gateway_Payment (exclusive â†’ parallel).

Both missed items are significant, reflecting major errors per the strict grading standard. Only the ADDED TASKS and one gateway change are correctly reported; the rest are missing.
