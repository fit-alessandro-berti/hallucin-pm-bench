The LLM answer is correct in its conclusion ("No") and accurately identifies the two violating cases (C002 and C004) with precise sequences and explanations, directly disproving the "always" claim by citing relevant evidence from the log. This aligns well with the task requirements. However, it deducts a point for lacking the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case coverage (omitting explicit verification of the complying cases C001 and C003) and structured table format, which provides fuller transparency without relying on implication. No factual errors, but the presentation is slightly less exhaustive under strict evaluation.
