The LLM answer is mostly accurate and provides clear evidence, but it has a few shortcomings compared to the ground truth that warrant a deduction:

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate.
- Cites relevant case IDs and the correct sequence of activities.
- Notes that in the cases where both activities appear, the order is reversed from the claim.
- Correctly mentions that Case 1002 does not provide evidence since "Update_Inventory" does not appear.

**Shortcomings:**
- Slightly misses out on emphasizing that the use of "always" in the fact makes it immediately false just from the absence in Case 1002; the ground truth addresses this explicitly.
- Does not explicitly state that "Authorize_Refund" never immediately precedes "Update_Inventory" anywhere.
- The justification could be a little clearer on why the use of "always" is invalidated by a single exception (Case 1002).

**Overall:**  
The answer is quite good, but the small lapses in precision, especially concerning the use of "always" and the explicit stating of "immediately precedes," justify a reduction from a perfect score.
