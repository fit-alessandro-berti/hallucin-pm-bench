The LLM answer fully meets all prompt criteria with exact matches to the ground truth on activities, ranking, and verbatim waiting-time figures (averages and 95th percentiles). It maintains a crisp memo format under 150 words (approx. 110 words), omits all non-waiting metrics and unrelated activities, and provides concrete, logically relevant actions per activity that explicitly target â‰¥20% waiting-time reductions without unsupported inventions. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., "95th %-tile" vs. "p95") do not impact correctness or adherence.
