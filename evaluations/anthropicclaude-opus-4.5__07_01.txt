The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added: "check_vip" and "generate_qr" by exact name; removed: "send_rma_label" by exact name; gateway: "gw_valid" from exclusive to inclusive). No speculation or extras. However, strict deductions for: (1) headings not exact (### vs specified • or GT's **); (2) list bullets (- vs GT's *); (3) missing ids (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`) in all task entries, despite GT including them for precise XML reference and prompt's "element names exactly"; (4) gateway phrasing less precise (omits **bold** and explicit (v1)/(v2)); (5) no final clarifying note. Core content matches 95%+, but format/precision gaps warrant -1.5.
