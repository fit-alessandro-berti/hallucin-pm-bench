9.0

**a) Decision points:**  
The LLM answer clearly and concisely describes both decision points (the risk-based skip, and the TriVote approval), and the decision rules are accurate and directly reflect the process description. Both answers precisely state the rules; the ground truth uses "the process bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review," and the LLM answer says "skip Manual-Underwriting-Review." On the TriVote, the LLM uses "Loan is approved if at least two out of three...give their approval," which matches the intent, even if the ground truth slightly more explicitly says "may advance only when at least two of the three approvers...approve." The minor variation in wording is not misleading, nor does it technically alter the rule. No error here.

**b) Documents:**  
The LLM correctly lists all nine required documents in the proper order, with no hallucinated or missing items. All document names (and order) exactly match the ground truth. A minor difference is the inclusion of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a line item rather than clarifying it's "Offer Sheet 77" (signed), but this reflects what the process explicitly calls for. "Scorecard–Cyan," "Scorecard–Magenta," and "Scorecard–Yellow" are correctly listed.

**Loss of point:**  
The only minor loss is in b): During the process step where the applicant is to confirm, the required documents are "Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration" as per the process, and the LLM answer splits "Offer Sheet 77" and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" into two document entries. Technically, "Offer Sheet 77" is prepared in Step 7, and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is requested in Step 8—it’s possible to interpret these as the same document at different stages, or as distinct documents (the prepared offer vs the applicant-signed version). The ground truth avoids splitting them. The LLM's splitting can be seen as slightly less concise, introducing a subtle ambiguity about whether they are distinct artifacts. This is a very minor imprecision.

**Conclusion:**  
No major factual errors or serious omissions. The very slight ambiguity regarding "Offer Sheet 77" vs. "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (perhaps they are really one, but more likely the process considers prep and signed as separate milestones) justifies docking a single point for utmost strictness.

**Final Score: 9.0**
