The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and accuracy, with part (b) matching exactly. For part (a), minor wording variances (e.g., "Post Tri-Color-Risk-Check Conditional Branch" vs. "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; "skip" vs. "bypasses"; "give their approval" vs. "record 'Approve.'"; no "only when" conditional phrasing) and punctuation (e.g., comma in "â‚¬250,000") constitute small errors but do not alter the core meaning, warranting a slight deduction under strict evaluation criteria. No hallucinations or extraneous elements are present.
