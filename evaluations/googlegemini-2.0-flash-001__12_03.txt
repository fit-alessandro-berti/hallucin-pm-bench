The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall inaccuracy ("No"), cites all relevant CaseIDs (C001–C004), and accurately describes the key sequences violating or supporting the FACT (e.g., "Pack_Items" intervening in C002, "Check_Fraud" in C004, and immediate succession in C001/C003). This directly aligns with the ground truth's case-by-case analysis and conclusion that "always" does not hold due to two violations. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's explicit table format, quantified summary ("two out of four"), and verbatim sequence arrows (→), which provide slightly more structured visual clarity—per strict evaluation, these formatting omissions count as small but notable deviations from the ideal comprehensive justification.
