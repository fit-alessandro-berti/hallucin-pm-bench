**10.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, sequence, distinct items, ordering, and formatting requirements:

- **Q1/A1**: Identical (3). Parenthetical list is accurate and non-fabricated.
- **Q2/A2**: Identical sequence and separators. No underscores needed (prompt/log uses none; ground truth escaping is presentational).
- **Q3/A3**: Identical distinct activities, one per line, alphabetically ordered (Arrange_Delivery before Check_Stock). Explanation is accurate, non-hallucinated (correctly identifies per-case predecessors without errors or extras). Minor presentational differences (no "-" or "<br>") are irrelevant as prompt specifies "one per line" only, not exact markers. No missing, extra, or fabricated elements.
