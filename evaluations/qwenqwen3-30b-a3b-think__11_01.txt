7.0

**Justification:**

* **Correct activities and ranking:** The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities by waiting time: #1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability.
* **Correct metrics quoted:** For each activity, both the average and 95th percentile waiting times are quoted correctly, and in the required (activity, avg, 95th) order.
* **No irrelevant content:** Other activities or non-waiting-time metrics are not mentioned.
* **Word count:** The memo stays under 150 words.
* **Action quality/compliance:** Here is where deductions are significant:
  * The proposed actions are *too vague and generic* compared to the ground truth, and do not offer clear, concrete, data-driven approaches. They do not mention specific figures for projected waiting-time reduction or methods demonstrably tied to ≥20%.
  * For **Request_Documents**, “automate document-verification workflows” may not address the primary cause (customer delay)—the ground truth specifies automated customer reminders with escalation.
  * For **Send_Closure_Letter**, “digital templates and pre-approval checks” is too generic; the ground truth specifies e-signature same-day letters triggered on claim closure.
  * For **Assess_Liability**, “AI-driven risk scoring to prioritize high-complexity cases” is vaguer and broader than rules-engine pre-classification for bypassing queues.
  * The LLM answer claims ≥20% reduction for all recommendations **without support or specifics from the prompt**—whereas the ground truth actions cite tested or estimated improvements.
* **Strictness:** Per instruction, these shortcomings in specificity and lack of data-driven, precise action recommendations warrant a significant penalty.

**Summary:**  
Score is **7.0** – strong on basic requirements, but notable, systematic lack of concrete, tailored action steps in line with the ground truth.
