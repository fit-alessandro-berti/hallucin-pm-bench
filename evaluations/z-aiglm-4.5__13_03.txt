8.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Perfect match to ground truth (exact count of 1, with correct evidence). No deductions.
- **Question 2**: Strong coverage of core issues (tiny/unrepresentative sample, potential skew from omissions, extrapolation risks; ~85 words, under limit). Aligns well on sampling error and context lacks. However, strict deduction for omissions: misses ground truth's statistical precision (e.g., confidence intervals, rare-event sampling swings quantified as 0-7% per events, <2-hour span, 14 events), and key nuance on near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing string/fuzzy matching distortionsâ€”critical for process-mining string analysis. These gaps reduce depth/accuracy by ~18%, per strict criteria. Total: High but not flawless.
