9.5

• Distinct cases: 3 (C123, C456, C789)  
• Case C456 – activity immediately before “Ship_Order”: Pack_Items  
• Activity occurring exactly once: Cancel_Order

**Evaluation:**

- All three answers are factually correct and match the ground truth.
- The only issue is minimal: the LLM did not use the exact requested bullet point style (**bullets, not asterisks/numbered**, but this is a minor formatting deviation).
- The LLM answer is otherwise precise, concise, and matches ground truth with no content errors.

**Strict Penalty Justification:**  
The slight difference in formatting (normal bullet points instead of asterisk and dash, and slightly different answer structure) results in a small penalty per strict instructions. Thus, 9.5/10.
