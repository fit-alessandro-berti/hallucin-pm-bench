**9.2**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in core message (cannot derive/compute due to missing timestamps/durations), structure (clear statement + reasoning), and fidelity to the system instruction (states cannot derive, supported by data context). Minor deductions for: (1) extraneous details not in ground truth (historical benchmark reference, instance count of 4, hypothetical formula)—these are correct but introduce differences beyond concise "cannot compute" + core reasoning; (2) omission of "ordering information" and "fabricated" emphasis, slightly less strict phrasing; (3) more verbose explanation vs. ground truth's brevity. No factual errors, but strict difference-based scoring penalizes additions (-0.8 total).
