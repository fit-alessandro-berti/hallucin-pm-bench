9.2

**Evaluation Breakdown (strict line-by-line scoring):**

- **Q1/A1**: LLM "3 distinct cases." vs. GT "**3**". Factual match (3 is correct), but extraneous words ("distinct cases.") and period deviate from concise GT format. Minor verbosity: -0.4 pts.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact content match (sequence correct, → separators, order). Escaping in GT (\_) is rendering artifact; irrelevant. Full points.
- **Q3/A3**: Content exact (distinct predecessors: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock; alpha-ordered; one per line). No extras/missing. LLM omits GT's "-" bullets and "<br>" (HTML), but prompt specifies only "one per line, alphabetically ordered" — bullets not required. Minor format deviation from GT display: -0.4 pts.

**Overall**: Factually perfect (no hallucinations/errors). Deductions only for small format/verbosity diffs per strict criteria (significant loss for small errors). Base 10.0 - 0.8 = 9.2.
