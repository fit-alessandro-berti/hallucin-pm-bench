The LLM answer correctly identifies and enumerates all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names and ordering, matching the ground truth content precisely. The only minor deviation is the addition of an introductory sentence, which is unnecessary per the prompt's instruction to return the answer "as numbered lines" without extra text. This small formatting error warrants a slight deduction under strict evaluation criteria, but the core response is accurate and complete.
