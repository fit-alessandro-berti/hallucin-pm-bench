9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, with just minor differences from the ideal/ground truth:

1. Correctly identifies 1 occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check".
2. Correct percentage calculation (5.56%), with correct rounding.
3. Correctly lists only case "A1002" as containing "Manual_Fraud_Check".
4. Provides two non-overlapping, sampling-relevant reasons: "limited sample size" (matches "small sample size") and "lack of temporal representation" (essentially covers "temporal bias").

Small discrepancies, warranting a one-point deduction for strictness (as requested):
- For question 4, the LLM's second point ("Lack of temporal representation: ... might not capture ... seasonality, or trends") is slightly less precise than the ground truth's explicit note about the morning of May 1, but still captures the core idea.
- The answer does not mention other possible biases (case-mix, survivorship), but wasn't required so as long as two valid points were listed.
- Formatting: Percent is given as 5.56, not "5.56 %", though the surrounding text makes the percentage clear.

Thus, this is a strong answer with only very minor deviations.
