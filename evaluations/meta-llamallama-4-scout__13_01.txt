### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match (1 occurrence). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Calculation and value (5.56%) match, including rounding. Minor deduction for inconsistency in final summary (omits "%" symbol present in step-by-step explanation), per strictness on small formatting/precision differences.
- **Question 3**: Exact match (A1002). No deduction.
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, sampling-related reasons (limited sample size; lack of temporal representation) that align with ground truth options (small sample size; temporal bias). Reasons are well-stated with brief justification in step-by-step section. Minor deduction for final summary being overly abbreviated (lacks the explanatory depth of ground truth examples, e.g., no mention of variance or specific biases like case-mix), treating this as a small but notable shortfall in completeness under strict evaluation.

Overall, the response is accurate, derives only from the log (no hallucinations), and structures answers helpfully without violating instructions. Total differences are minimal, but strictness requires docking 0.5 points for formatting/conciseness issues.
