10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct and aligns very closely with the ground truth, showing no significant errors or unwarranted inference:

1. For Q1, it correctly identifies 1 occurrence.
2. For Q2, the percentage is both correctly calculated and rounded to two decimal places: 5.56%.
3. For Q3, the single correct case, A1002, is named.
4. For Q4, two distinct, clearly explained sampling-related reasons are given ("sample too small" and "fragment covers only one day"), echoing the substance of the ground truth list. The additional comments are within reason and do not invent information outside the log data constraints.

No factual, computational, or scope errors are present.
