**9.0**

- The LLM answer is numerically accurate for (1), (2a), and (2b), exactly matching the ground truth values for frequency and percentages, with correct calculations and rounding. No error here.
- For (3), the explanation addresses the single-occurrence issue, potential for poor predictive/statistical generalisation, and notes representativeness issues. However, it does not explicitly mention the instability/variance or how averages or other metrics could be skewed by a single case, nor does it mention statistical confidence or confidence intervals, as the model answer does. This is a minor but significant omission per the strict grading here.

Given flawless numeric answers and a good—but not fully complete—explanation according to the ground truth constraints, a 9.0 is warranted. There is clear, meaningful information missing regarding quantitative instability, which prevents a perfect score.
