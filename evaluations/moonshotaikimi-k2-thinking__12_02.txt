The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, structure (starting with "No" followed by a single-paragraph justification citing the exact same counterexamples with line numbers and case IDs), and reasoning, with no errors or omissions. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., lack of bolding or bullets) do not constitute substantive deviations under strict evaluation criteria focused on accuracy and fidelity to the prompt's requirements.
