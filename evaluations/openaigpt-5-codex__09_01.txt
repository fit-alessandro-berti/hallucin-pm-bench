The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be derived, aligning with the ground truth's core conclusion and the system instruction to state this clearly when unsupported by data. However, it earns a deduction for incompleteness: it does not address the second part of the user prompt ("Briefly explain your calculation"), which the ground truth fulfills with a detailed reasoning explanation. This omission, even if the calculation is impossible, represents a small but significant gap in responsiveness under strict evaluation, as it fails to provide the requested brief explanation of why it cannot be computed (e.g., lack of timestamps/durations). No fabrication or errors in facts, but the brevity limits full fidelity to the ground truth structure and user query.
