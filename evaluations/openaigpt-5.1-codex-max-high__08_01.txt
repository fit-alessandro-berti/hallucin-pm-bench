The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" with a valid, concise firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, including relevant markings and a brief justification matching the prompt's requirements (p3=1, p4=0 enables T5). It avoids the ground truth's error (impossible T4 firing after T5 consumes p3) and fulfills "justify briefly" precisely.

Minor deductions for stylistic/presentation differences under utmost strictness:
- No explicit "(inhibitor p4)" reminder in T5 step (though implied/correctly reasoned).
- Bullet-list vs. numbered sequence; LaTeX vs. backticks; inline vs. separate justification.
- Lacks ground truth's extra (accurate) insight that T5 "must" precede T3 if fired, and full enabling rule formalization.

Semantically identical on core answer; superior by omitting ground truth's flaw.
