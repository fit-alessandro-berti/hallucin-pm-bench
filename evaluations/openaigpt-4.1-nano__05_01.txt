The LLM answer partially aligns by correctly placing a 48-hour boundary timer on Task_Receive, which addresses the submission-to-triage timeline start. However, it deviates significantly from the ground truth: it fails to connect the timer directly to Task_Triage for bypassing (instead routing to an undefined external "escalation handling process" outside the diagram, violating reuse of existing elements and not ensuring SLA compliance by reaching triage); omits specifying an *interrupting* timer (critical for interruption and bypass, risking non-compliance if non-interrupting); and introduces vague external dependencies, adding conceptual new elements indirectly prohibited. These errors undermine the core improvement, warranting major deductions despite concise English and ID reference.
