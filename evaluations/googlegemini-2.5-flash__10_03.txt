**Assessment:**
- The LLM answer used only the authorized vocabulary and did not leak unauthorized synonyms—this is correct and essential per instructions.
- The number of activities expanded beyond those strictly listed in the ground truth—specifically, the addition of "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst." This is a notable deviation and introduces extra content not requested or described in the ground truth.
- Several RACI assignments differ from the ground truth:
  - For *Intake Vetting*: Front-Office Analyst is correctly R, A, but missing the C for Compliance Analyst and I for Treasury Ops. (“C” for Compliance Analyst, “I” for Treasury Ops are omissions.)
  - For *KYC Review* and *AML Screening*: The ground truth says Compliance Officer is “C”, and Treasury Ops is “I”—LLM answer omits those consult/informed assignments.
  - For *Risk Scoring*: Should be “C” for Front-Office Analyst, “R” for Compliance Analyst, “A” for Compliance Officer, “I” for Treasury Ops. LLM assigned “I” to Front-Office, “R, A” to Compliance Analyst, and “I” to Compliance Officer (wrong accountabilities).
  - *Compliance Officer Approval* is generally accurate.
  - *Release Funds*: LLM adds Compliance Officer and Compliance Analyst as “I” (should be “C” for both, per ground truth). Also, ground truth omits “I” for Compliance Officer.
- Overall, while activity names and vocabulary are correct, extra activities, missing or misassigned RACI codes, and lack of adherence to precise assignments in the ground truth warrant significant deduction.
- Markdown formatting is compliant.

**Summary:**  
No forbidden synonyms are used, so the most crucial rule is followed. However, the answer is penalized due to unauthorized activity expansion and several mismatches in RACI role assignments, particularly missing “C” and “I” roles. A strict evaluation reflects these as substantial errors even if the core logic is partially preserved.
