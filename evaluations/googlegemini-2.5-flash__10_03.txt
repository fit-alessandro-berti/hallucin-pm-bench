The LLM answer correctly uses the four authorized vocabulary terms without synonyms and formats as a Markdown table, but it violates the "do not add activities" rule by including unauthorized extras ("Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst") not present in the ground truth, while omitting or mishandling the conditional/escalation logic. RACI assignments deviate significantly: e.g., empty cells instead of explicit "–" or "C"/"I"; incorrect roles like Front-Office Analyst as "I" for KYC/AML/Risk Scoring instead of "–" or "C"; missing "C" involvements (e.g., Compliance Officer for KYC/AML); no bolding for activities or key assignments. These errors, including additions and inaccuracies, warrant substantial deduction under strict criteria.
