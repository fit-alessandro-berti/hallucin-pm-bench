The LLM answer correctly identifies the count for Q1 (exact match to ground truth's "1", with accurate but unnecessary elaboration). For Q2, it addresses small sample size and potential bias (â‰¤120 words), but omits key ground truth elements: quantitative sampling volatility (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, extreme error for rare events), the <2-hour span and 14-event scale, and distortion from near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") via strict vs. fuzzy matching. These omissions reduce depth and data-specific insight, warranting a deduct for incompleteness under strict criteria.
