7.0

1️⃣ The LLM answer to Q1 is accurate and complete: it correctly reports that "Manual Fraud Check" appears exactly once in the excerpt.

2️⃣ For Q2, the answer captures the main reason for misestimation: small, potentially unrepresentative sample size (3 cases), which could bias an analyst's impression. However, it lacks several important details found in the ground truth answer, specifically:
- It does not reference the effect of sampling error or confidence intervals, especially as applied to rare events.
- It omits explanation of how one event significantly affects apparent prevalence in a small sample.
- It does not mention the presence of near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) and the risk of misclassification or over/under-counting due to fuzzy matching, which is explicitly referenced in the ground truth.
- It does not emphasize that only a much larger or complete sample can support reliable prevalence estimation.

These omissions reflect a moderate, not minor, difference in the completeness and depth compared to the ground truth answer, justifying a substantial point deduction for strict grading.
