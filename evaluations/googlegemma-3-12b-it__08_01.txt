The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, asserting "No" with a flawed proof that misinterprets the inhibitor arc's role and the firing dependencies (e.g., it wrongly implies T3 must precede T5 for enablement, ignoring the sequence T1 → T2 → T5 → T3). This directly contradicts the ground truth's "Yes" and explicit sequence, resulting in zero alignment on key facts, reasoning, and conclusion. No partial credit applies under strict evaluation.
