While the LLM answer provides a clear and logical explanation, it is fundamentally incorrect regarding Question 1, asserting "No" when the correct answer is "Yes." Instead of identifying that T5 can fire before T3, it incorrectly reasons that T5’s firing disables T3 and thus T3 must fire first. The answer offers a technically plausible-seeming argument, but this logic is flawed as it overlooks the alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) for achieving P5 while holding P2. The explanation is structured well, but the core misunderstanding leads to a completely incorrect conclusion, and not even a correct firing sequence is attempted (as required for Q2 in case the answer had been "Yes"). Due to this critical error and lack of demonstration, only minimal points can be awarded.
