**3.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria)
- **Correctness (activities & numbers)**: #1 & #2 correct (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter) with verbatim quotes. #3 **fatally wrong** (Initial_Screening at 2.1h vs. true #3 Assess_Liability at 7.8h). Loses ~40% here. (-3.0 pts)
- **No unwarranted content**: Compliant—no service times, throughput, or extras. (+1.0 pt)
- **Actions**: Vague, non-data-driven (e.g., "implement automated..."; no pilots, estimates, or ≥20% evidence cited). Ground truth has concrete, quantified remedies. Major deviation. (-2.5 pts)
- **Format/Conciseness**: Excessive fluff (headers, subject, closings, "enhance efficiency"); ~120 words vs. ground truth's bare ~80. Not "crisp." (-1.3 pts)

Total reflects ~⅔ alignment on core facts but critical failures in ranking/actions per strict ground-truth match.
