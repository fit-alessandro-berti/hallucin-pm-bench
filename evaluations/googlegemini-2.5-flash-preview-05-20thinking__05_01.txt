- The LLM identifies adding a boundary timer to Task_Receive with a 48h duration, which matches the ground truth intent and correct element ID.
- However, it incorrectly specifies a **non-interrupting** boundary timer. The ground truth requires an **interrupting** timer to ensure the main flow is interrupted, forcing triage if not yet reached—this is crucial for enforcement and process compliance.
- The LLM’s proposal to create a **Message End Event** ("End_Escalate") diverges from "no new tasks or subprocesses" since end events are considered flow nodes, and the ground truth wants reuse of existing Task_Triage for escalation.
- The LLM does not clarify that outstanding document requests are bypassed, while the ground truth makes this explicit.
- The LLM says the main flow continues unaffected, when it should be forcibly diverted according to the ground truth.
- Score is penalized heavily for the type of boundary event, the misunderstanding of escalation handling, adding an extraneous end event, and for process compliance reasons, as these are all critical errors for SLA enforcement in BPMN.
