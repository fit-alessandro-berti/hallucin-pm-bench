The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) as the ground truth, with a valid explanation that T5 fires before T3 by leaving P2 unmarked until then. However, it loses points for lacking the precise intermediate markings (e.g., M₁ = {P1, P2}), which the ground truth uses to rigorously demonstrate reachability and state evolution. The explanation is concise but omits the ground truth's detail on T3's subsequent disablement, reducing clarity on why the precedence is confirmed. Minor phrasing (e.g., reverse dependency order for minimality) is awkwardly worded but not erroneous. Overall, strong match with minor omissions in precision and detail.
