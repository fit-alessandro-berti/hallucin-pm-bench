9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Compliance and Conclusion (10/10)**: Both answers correctly conclude "Non-compliant" based on the same two violations (Rules 2 and 3), with accurate identification of the issues (reversed order for Risk_Assessment before Ship_Goods; Three_way_match too far after Goods_Received).
- **Content Accuracy (9.5/10)**: Core facts match perfectly for all rules (e.g., event positions, roles, and rule interpretations). Rule 1, 4, and 5 are correctly assessed as satisfied in both. Minor deduction for Rule 3 wording: LLM uses "four steps after" (accurate in sequential counting from event 6 to 10), but ground truth specifies "distance = 3" (aligning with the prompt's "distance ≤ 2" terminology, possibly counting intervening events). This is a small terminological inconsistency but not a factual error.
- **Structure and Format (8.5/10)**: Both follow the required format ("Non-compliant" followed by numbered justification citing rules). However, ground truth systematically numbers and evaluates *all* 5 rules individually (1-5), providing exhaustive coverage. LLM groups violations first (1-2) then summarizes others (3), which is concise but less comprehensive and deviates slightly from ground truth's per-rule structure. Significant deduction under strictness for this structural difference, as it omits explicit per-rule numbering for satisfied rules.
- **Clarity and Completeness (9.5/10)**: LLM's justification is clear, cites rules directly, and includes a summary conclusion mirroring ground truth. Minor deduction for not bolding/emphasizing satisfied rules as explicitly as ground truth (e.g., ground truth uses "**Satisfied**" and "**Violated**" labels per rule).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Under utmost strictness, the structural variance and distance wording nuance warrant a ~0.8 point deduction from a potential 10.0, but the answers are substantively near-identical with no major errors.
