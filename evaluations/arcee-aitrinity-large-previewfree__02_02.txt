**10.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, sequence, distinct elements, alphabetical order, and factual precision across all questions:
- Q1/A1: Identical ("3").
- Q2/A2: Identical sequence and separators (underscores are formatting artifacts in ground truth; no functional difference).
- Q3/A3: Identical distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered (no extras/missing; minor presentational differences like "-" vs. plain lines are irrelevant to factual scoring). No hallucinations or errors.
