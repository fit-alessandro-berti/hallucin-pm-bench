**9.8**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect, matching ground truth exactly on Q1 (1 occurrence), Q2a (2.08%), and Q2b (8.33%) with correct calculations and rounding. Formatting is clear and data-faithful.

For Q3 (≤100 words, ~85 used): Covers (i) low-support/single-occurrence via "only a few... extremely small sample... rare occurrence"; (ii) variance/instability via "inflates variance... over-fit"; (iii) over-generalisation via "not representative... inaccurate forecasts... misguided... decisions". Excellent essence, process-mining relevance (performance metrics, prediction), no invention.

Minor deduction (-0.2) for not explicitly stating "single occurrence/one observation" in Q3 (uses "few/small/rare" instead), per strict "small errors" rule, despite implication from Q1/context.
