- The LLM answer gives:
    - "3 distinct cases (C123, C456, C789)" — matches ground truth ("3 cases (C123, C456, C789)")
    - For C456, "Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" — matches ground truth.
    - "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once — matches ground truth.

Small deductions:
- Not strictly bullet-point formatting as the ground truth answer does (uses sentence fragments, not precisely the same), and is slightly wordier than the "concise, bullet-point" request.
- The answer could be formatted even more concisely/customized as per the example in ground truth.

No factual errors, but the small difference in format (using too many words: "distinct cases", "appears exactly once") warrants a minor penalty.
