9.0

### Evaluation Notes:
- **Q1**: Exact match in content and near-exact phrasing (minor addition of "distinct"); full credit.
- **Q2**: Correct activity identified ("Pack_Items"), but response is overly verbose by rephrasing the question instead of providing only the concise name as in ground truth; deduct 1.0 for lack of strict conciseness per prompt instructions.
- **Q3**: Exact match; full credit.
- Overall: Highly accurate on substance, with minor formatting/conciseness deviation impacting score under strict criteria.
