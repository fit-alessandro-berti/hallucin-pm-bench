**1.0**

The LLM answer fails critically on multiple fronts with utmost strictness: (1) proposes **two** invalid changes (PrepareContract dueDate and adding dueDate to EndEvent, which is semantically incorrect for an endEvent and exceeds "exactly ONE" improvement); (2) uses **two separate diff hunks** instead of a single hunk; (3) changes the **wrong task** (PrepareContract P2D→P1D vs. ground truth CollectEquipment P5D→P2D); (4) **omits the required one-sentence rationale entirely**; (5) diff formatting mismatches ground truth (includes unnecessary line ranges and context). No partial credit for attempting a dueDate modification, as all elements deviate substantially.
