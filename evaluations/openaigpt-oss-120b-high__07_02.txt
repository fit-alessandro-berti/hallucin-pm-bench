7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes in content (added tasks: 3 correct; removed tasks: 1 correct; gateway change: accurate type shift from exclusive to inclusive). No factual errors or omissions regarding the BPMN elements, and it adheres to the required headings while ignoring renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan") and cosmetics.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting mismatches (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: Uses bullet points instead of numbered lists; reverses presentation order (ID first, then name in parentheses) vs. ground truth (bold name first, then ID in backticks); lacks the explanatory acronyms (XOR/OR) and version references (v1/v2) in the gateway section; includes unnecessary extra detail ("the element ID remained the same").
- **Minor wording/presentation differences (-1.0 point)**: Gateway description uses full XML tag names ("exclusiveGateway" → "inclusiveGateway") instead of semantic terms ("exclusive (XOR)" → "inclusive (OR)"), deviating from the prompt's example ("Exclusive → Inclusive") and ground truth style. Lacks the closing note "(No other additions...)" for completeness.
- These are small but non-trivial differences in structure and phrasing, warranting point loss per instructions, though content fidelity prevents a lower score.

Overall, strong on substance (9.0+ equivalent) but penalized for not mirroring ground truth format precisely.
