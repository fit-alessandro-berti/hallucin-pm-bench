7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the ground truth on core content without speculation or errors in detection. However, under strict evaluation criteria, several small but significant differences in presentation and structure reduce the score:

- **Heading format**: LLM uses "• **Added tasks**" (with bullet and bold), while ground truth uses "**Added tasks**" (bold only, no bullet). This deviates from the exact heading style in the ground truth.
- **List item structure and order**: LLM lists items as "- id 'name'" (e.g., "- check_vip 'Check Customer VIP Status'"), prioritizing ID first with quotes. Ground truth uses "* Name (id = `id`)" (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"), prioritizing the task name first with parenthetical ID in backticks. This reverses the emphasis and uses different punctuation/symbols.
- **Gateway details**: LLM states "- gw_valid changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway" without specifying versions (v1/v2) or bolding the gateway types. Ground truth includes "(v1)" and "(v2)" for clarity, plus bolding (**exclusiveGateway** and **inclusiveGateway**), making it more precise and matching the XML versions explicitly.
- **Additional elements**: Ground truth includes a closing note "*(No other differences should be reported.)*", which LLM omits. While not required by the prompt, its absence creates a structural difference.
- **Overall fidelity**: No extraneous content or errors, but the format inconsistencies (bullets, ordering, punctuation) prevent a perfect match, warranting a deduction of 3.0 points for "small errors" per the strictness guideline. A higher score (e.g., 9.0+) would require near-identical phrasing and styling.
