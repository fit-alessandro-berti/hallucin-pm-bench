The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, correctly identifying all added tasks, the removed task, and both gateway changes with precise IDs, names, and type transitions. However, minor formatting deviations—adding "#" prefixes to headings (violating the "verbatim" requirement) and lacking the exact spacing/alignment in the second gateway line (e.g., extra spaces after the colon for parallelism)—result in a small but noticeable deduction under strict evaluation criteria. No other errors, guesses, or extraneous commentary are present.
