**7.2**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible ("yes"), uses the correct shortcut path via T2b to enable T5 without prior T3 firing, provides accurate step-by-step markings for the first 4 transitions (matching ground truth exactly), and correctly notes the lower bound of 4 transitions for enabling T5. The explanation highlights the shortcut skipping pc, aligning with ground truth's "why this works" rationale.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Major difference in provided sequence**: LLM gives `T1 → T2b → T4 → T5` (4 steps, T3 never fires); ground truth gives full `T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3` (6 steps, explicitly firing T3 after T5 to demonstrate ordering). LLM's sequence is only a prefix and does not include the feedback loop (T6/T3) to show T3 firing post-T5, which ground truth presents as essential for proving the ordering.
- **Shortest sequence claim mismatch**: LLM claims 4 is shortest; ground truth claims 6 is minimal (acknowledging 4 lower bound but requiring +2 for T3 post-T5). This is a significant error in the core deliverable.
- **Incomplete demonstration of ordering**: LLM argues T3 "never fires" suffices for "before"; ground truth requires/explicitly shows both firing with T5 first (noting T6 reinjects pc for T3). This misses ground truth's emphasis on post-T5 feasibility via loop.
- **Format/verbosity differences**: LLM is more verbose with sections (analysis, steps, key points); ground truth is compact with inline numbered markings/comments. Minor, but adds divergence.
- **Missing elements**: No mention of feedback loop or post-T5 T3 enabling; ground truth dedicates "why this works" to it.

~70-75% match in substance (correct path/logic/core markings), but key mismatches in sequence completeness, shortness justification, and full ordering proof warrant -2.8 point deduction from 10. Small matching details (e.g., exact phrasing like "shortcut") prevent lower score.
