The LLM answer correctly states that the required metrics cannot be calculated, and it provides a clear, precise explanation referencing the absence of the necessary event-log data. It also correctly points out the irrelevant nature of the SLA data for this calculation. 

It loses 1 point because, in contrast to the Ground Truth, it could be slightly more explicit about the need for concrete execution times or "raw log entries" for "Approve Invoice" specifically, and it could more clearly echo that absolutely *no* event data are available to even compute *one* value. The answer is, otherwise, accurate and does not make unwarranted assumptions.
