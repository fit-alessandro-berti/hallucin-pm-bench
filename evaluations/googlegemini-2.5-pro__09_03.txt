The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying the impossibility of computation due to redacted timestamps and event rows in Artefact A, while explaining the insufficiency of both artefacts without guessing or external knowledge. It matches the task's requirement for a precise, short explanation in one paragraph. Minor deductions for slight stylistic differences (e.g., more elaboration on Artefact B's 7.8-day metric versus the ground truth's conciseness, and phrasing "standard deviation, or a confidence interval" instead of directly mirroring "dispersion or confidence interval") and not explicitly stating "additional raw log entries are required," though these do not alter the core accuracy.
