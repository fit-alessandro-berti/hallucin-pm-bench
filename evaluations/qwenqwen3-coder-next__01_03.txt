7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
**Part a) – Score contribution: 9.0/10 (minor deductions)**
- Identifies exactly the two decision points correctly.
- Sentences closely match ground truth in rule description (risk condition identical; TriVote rule equivalent: "at least two approvals/votes" vs. "at least two... record 'Approve'").
- Deductions (-1.0 total): 
  - Added unrequested labels ("Conditional Branch (Step 4)", "Gate “TriVote” (Step 6)"), step references, and explanatory note – ground truth is purely concise summaries without extras.
  - Minor phrasing: "€250,000" (comma) vs. "€250 000" (space); "vote in favor" vs. "record 'Approve'".

**Part b) – Score contribution: 5.5/10 (major deductions)**
- Core list order mostly correct for 8/9 items (Form 14B → scorecards → Deck Memo → Offer Sheet 77 → Loan Dossier 2025).
- Correctly separates scorecards (2–4).
- Deductions (-4.5 total, significant for strictness):
  - **Misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" entirely as a separate document** in final list (ground truth #7; first appears Step 8). LLM mentions it descriptively but merges with #6 "Offer Sheet 77" (Step 7) – incomplete "all documents" (-2.5).
  - Erroneous "(7 documents)" claim despite listing 8 items (-0.5).
  - Unrequested caveat "(if Step 5 is reached)" on Deck Memo and "universally required" clarification – ground truth lists flatly without conditionals (-0.5).
  - Extra descriptive preamble justifying scorecards as "inputs/documented artifacts" and end-note on conditionals – not in ground truth (-0.5).
  - No hallucinations (good), but list not precisely matching format/order (e.g., Signed before ID Matrix in Step 8 per ground truth).

**Overall: 7.2/10** (weighted average; strong on a), flawed/incomplete on b) with extras violating conciseness. Strict penalties applied for omission, inaccuracies, and additions per instructions.
