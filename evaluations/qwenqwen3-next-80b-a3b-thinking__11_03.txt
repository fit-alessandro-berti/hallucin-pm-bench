7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies the excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) with matching throughput/waiting data from the table—earning strong marks for data fidelity (no inventions here, unlike the ground truth's added "4,805 cases," date, loan thresholds, and projections, which violate the prompt's anti-invention rule but serve as the benchmark).

However, strict deductions apply for:
- **Structural/header differences** (-0.5): "To/From/Subject" lines are less formal/specific than ground truth (e.g., "COO, Orion Credit" vs. "Chief Operating Officer"; no "Loan-Origination" or date reference), and lacks the introductory case total phrasing.
- **Wording and phrasing** (-0.5): Analysis section is concise but misses ground truth's emphasis on "materially breach... largest queues" and bolding/formatting for emphasis; it's plainer and doesn't tie waiting times as explicitly to "queues."
- **Recommendations** (-1.5): Bullet points are used correctly and reference wait times (data-driven), but actions are more generic ("automate document verification," "integrate real-time data," "streamline data collection") compared to ground truth's more concrete, inventive specifics (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks for low-risk," "add one analyst + automate," "straight-through heuristic under €25k"). Prompt requires "concrete, data-driven" actions, and while both invent slightly, LLM's lack the depth/specificity of the benchmark, reducing impact.
- **Overall completeness** (-0.5): No closing projection or broader impact statement (ground truth adds value with "reduce end-to-end by 35%"), making it shorter (~120 words vs. ground truth's ~180) and less executive-toned; misses "highlights three activities that materially breach" nuance.

Core alignment is high (80% match on key facts), but strictness for phrasing, specificity, and omissions prevents a higher score. No major errors like wrong activities or metrics, avoiding a sub-5.
