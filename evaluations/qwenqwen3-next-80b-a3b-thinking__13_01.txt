9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth ("1" occurrence). No deviations. Full credit.
- **Question 2**: Calculation and result identical (1/18 × 100 = 5.56%). Minor formatting difference (no space before "%" in LLM answer vs. ground truth's "5.56 %"), but this is a trivial typographical issue under strict evaluation. Deduct 0.2 points.
- **Question 3**: Core content matches (identifies A1002 correctly), but LLM omits the emphatic "only case" phrasing and full sentence structure from ground truth ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”."). This makes it slightly less precise in wording, though functionally correct. Deduct 0.4 points for phrasing deviation.
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid reasons (small sample size; temporal bias from single-day coverage) that align with ground truth options, stated clearly. Explanations are concise but accurate; however, they lack the deeper elaboration or examples (e.g., variance quantification or specific bias types like "temporal bias") in ground truth's ideal responses, reducing completeness. Deduct 0.2 points for shallower depth.

Overall, the LLM answer is highly faithful to the log data with no hallucinations or inferences, but minor phrasing, formatting, and elaboration differences warrant the deductions under strict criteria.
