**Score: 9.0**

**Evaluation:**

- **Q1:** Correct: "1" occurrence, matches ground truth exactly.
- **Q2:** Correct: "5.56%" with calculation, rounded as requested. The method matches ground truth.
- **Q3:** Correct: "A1002", succinctly explained and correct.
- **Q4:** Both reasons are valid, supported by the data, but there's a small accuracy penalty:
    - "Fragment covers only a single day..." = temporal bias (good).
    - "Sample size...is too small..." = small sample size (good).
    - However, the LLM answer says "single day (May 1)", but the actual fragment does not have an explicit date range—only timestamps on May 1. It also doesn't mention that the cases may not be representative (case-mix), nor does it discuss omission of cancelled/rejected orders (possible truncation/survivorship bias). Still, giving two valid sampling reasons satisfies the prompt.
- **Strictness:** The only small shortcoming is not listing the variety of possible biases in a way that matches the ground truth's depth and nuance. The answer technically fulfills the question, but lacks the richer diagnostics (e.g., effect of a single event on sampling error, case-mix, or survivorship).

Therefore—a very high, but slightly marked down, score (9.0) due to minor lack of analytical depth in question 4 compared to ground truth.
