**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a) – Major deductions (score ~5/10)**: 
  - LLM incorrectly identifies **3 decision points** vs. ground truth's **2**. The first ("Tri-Color Risk Check") is a factual error: it is not a "decision point (gate or conditional branch)" per the prompt/process (step 3 computes a rating unconditionally; no branch/gate there). This is a significant over-identification and mischaracterization, akin to hallucination.
  - Second point (skip logic) is ~90% match: phrasing close, captures rule accurately, minor wording diffs (e.g., "Underwriting skip logic" vs. "**Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check**"; "performed" vs. "proceeds to that review").
  - Third point (TriVote) ~95% match: rule identical in substance ("any two...suffice" matches process/ground truth), minor phrasing ("at least any two...approve" vs. "at least two...record “Approve.”").
  - Overall: structural mismatch (extra invalid point) + imperfect naming/phrasing = heavy loss under "utmost strictness" and "small errors significant loss."
- **Part (b) – Full credit (score 10/10)**: Exact match in list, order, items (9 total), and formatting. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML).
- **Overall**: Weighted average (~60% a, 40% b due to prominence), no other issues (e.g., no policy violations). 7.0 reflects strong b) but strict penalty for a's clear differences.
