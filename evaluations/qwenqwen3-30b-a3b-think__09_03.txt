The LLM answer is accurate in stating that the required metrics cannot be calculated due to absence of data and references the artefacts correctly. However, compared to the ground truth:

- It introduces an extra sentence discussing Artefact B's 7.8-day KPI, which is not directly relevant to why "Approve Invoice" cycle time can't be computed and adds minor unnecessary detail.
- The phrase "exact computation is impossible" is less strong and explicit than the ground truthâ€™s full explanation explicitly tying the missing timestamps to inability to calculate average, standard deviation, or confidence interval.
- Minor wording differences; the LLM's explanation does not mention the need for raw log entries.

Due to these (strictly enforced) deviations and extra content, a one-point deduction is applied.
