The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in identifying the core issue (redacted data in Artefact A preventing computation), explaining the absence of timestamps and durations precisely, and avoiding any computation or guessing. It covers the impossibility for the primary metric (average cycle time) and implies the same for secondary metrics (std dev and 95% CI) by stating "exact computation is impossible" without data. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (mentioning Artefact B details unnecessarily, though not incorrect) and not explicitly naming "dispersion or confidence interval" as in the ground truth, per strict evaluation criteria. No factual errors or deviations from the task's requirements.
