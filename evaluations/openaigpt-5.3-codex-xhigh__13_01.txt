**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1 (weight ~25%)**: Correct count (1). Minor deduction for verbose phrasing ("**“Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs exactly 1 time** in this fragment") vs. ground truth's concise "`1` occurrence". (-0.2)
- **Q2 (weight ~25%)**: Exact calculation and value (5.56%) match, including rounding. Minor formatting diffs (no space before "%", LaTeX fraction vs. inline "$1 ÷ 18 × 100$"; bolding). (-0.3)
- **Q3 (weight ~25%)**: Exact match on case (A1002, bolded). List format vs. ground truth sentence is a trivial style diff. (-0.1)
- **Q4 (weight ~25%)**: Both reasons valid and sampling-related ("small sample size" directly matches; "temporal/selection coverage" + one-date window aligns with "temporal bias"). Good specifics (18 events/4 cases, variance, short window/one date). Minor issues: "extraction method unknown" slight extra inference (not in log/ground truth); phrasing not identical to examples (e.g., no "±5.56 pp." or "later days"); "poor temporal/selection coverage" slightly vague vs. precise biases listed. (-0.4 total)

No hallucinations/inferences beyond log (e.g., no invented events). High fidelity overall, but strictness demands deductions for all phrasing/formatting variances and Q4 imprecision. Total deduction: 1.0 from 10.0.
