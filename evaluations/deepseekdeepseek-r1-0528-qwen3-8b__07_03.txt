The LLM answer correctly identified all added and removed tasks, and one gateway type change. However, it failed to list the gateway type change for `Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel`, which is present in the ground truth. Missing a required difference under the "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" heading is a critical omission and must result in a significant loss of points despite the rest being flawless.
