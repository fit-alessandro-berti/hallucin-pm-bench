### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth)
- **Vocabulary policy (pass, +1.0 baseline)**: Correct use of "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance" (exact spelling/capitalization); no forbidden terms. Matches notes rubric.
- **Structure & Content (major failures, -6.0)**:
  - Column headers: Abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) vs. full names (Account Manager/Compliance Officer/Finance Clerk/IT Support). Complete mismatch.
  - Activities: Names/order match, but no bolding on mandated terms (**KYC Review**, etc.) or R/A entries.
  - RACI allocations: Fundamentally incorrect/incomplete vs. ground truth.
    | Activity | Key Mismatches |
    |----------|----------------|
    | Receive Application | AM: "R/A" vs. "**R / A**" (formatting); others blank vs. C/I/I. |
    | KYC Review | CO: "R/A" vs. "**R**"; AM blank vs. "**A**"; others blank vs. C/I. Wrong A assignment. |
    | Order Vetting | AM match-ish ("R/A" vs. "**R / A**"); others blank vs. C/I/I. |
    | Payment Clearance | FC: "R/A" vs. "**R**"; AM blank vs. "**A**"; others blank vs. C/I. Wrong A assignment. |
    | Record Update | IT: "R/A" vs. "**R**"; others blank vs. C/I/C. Wrong A (none in GT, but implied mismatch); unwarranted A on IT. |
    | Notify Customer | AM match-ish; others blank vs. I/I/I. |
    - No exactly one R per row in full context (blanks ignore C/I); fails "Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate" (misses A on AM for KYC/Payment).
    - 18/24 cells blank (unwarranted omission); violates full RACI matrix expectation.
- **Unwarranted content (minor pass, +0.5)**: No extras, but incompleteness is a defect.
- **Formatting/Precision (fail, -1.5)**: No bolds, "R/A" vs. "**R / A**", table padding/alignment off.
- **Overall**: ~12% cell similarity (primaries partial); violates "reflect the narrative" fully (misses inferred A/C/I). Strict rubric demands near-identical match; small errors (headers/formatting) compound to major loss. Not self-aware/N/A.
