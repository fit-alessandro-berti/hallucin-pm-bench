7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Part 1**: Exact match to ground truth (both correctly identify 1 occurrence in case 1002). Full points hereâ€”no differences.
- **Part 2**: Partial match. The LLM correctly notes small sample size (3 cases) and naming inconsistencies (citing specific examples), which could lead to underestimation in a non-representative snippet. However, it lacks depth: misses quantitative details (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours, frequency swings from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals), statistical framing (sampling error for rare events), and broader distortion risks (strict vs. fuzzy matching). The explanation is superficial and word-limited (72 words vs. ground truth's ~120), omitting the analyst's need for a larger/random sample. Under strict criteria, this results in significant deduction for incompleteness and imprecision, despite staying under word limit and avoiding speculation. Overall alignment ~75%, hence the composite score.
