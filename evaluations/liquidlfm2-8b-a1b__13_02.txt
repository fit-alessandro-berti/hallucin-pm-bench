The LLM answer correctly identifies the occurrence count (1) and percentages (2.08% for events, 8.33% for cases), matching the ground truth exactly for questions 1 and 2. However, the explanation for question 3 (58 words, within limit) contains critical flaws under strict evaluation: it fabricates "frequent reliance... in multiple cases" (contradicting the single occurrence in C05 only, violating "do not invent information"); fails to explicitly mention the "single-occurrence issue" or vulnerability to noise/variance/instability (e.g., skewing averages or wide confidence intervals); and only vaguely cautions against over-generalization without tying to low-support risks like unreliable estimates. This introduces factual error and misses key criteria, warranting major deduction despite numeric accuracy.
