7.5

The LLM answer covers all functional differences, listing all added and removed tasks and both gateway type changes. However, it does not exactly follow the requested output format: it omits the hyphens ("- ") before items and does not align gateway IDs using spaces as in the ground truth. Additionally, it omits the indentation present in the ground truth under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES (extra spaces before Gateway_Payment). As strict formatting adherence was requested and these are clear formatting errors, there is a significant point deduction. However, no factual omissions or commissions are present, so the score does not drop below 7.
