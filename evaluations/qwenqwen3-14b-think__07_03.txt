The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with precise content matching the ground truth (added tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer; removed: Task_ManualReview; gateways: both from exclusive to parallel). Headings are verbatim and in order, with no extraneous commentary or unchanged elements mentioned. Minor deduction for formatting differences: lack of leading "- " bullets on list items and absence of aligning spaces in the second gateway entry, which deviates from the ground truth's presentation style despite not being explicitly mandated by the prompt.
