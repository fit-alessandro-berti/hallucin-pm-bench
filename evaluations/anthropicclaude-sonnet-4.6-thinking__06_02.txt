8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel sets from Process B with exact task names, in the correct order, and properly formatted as numbered lines with comma-separated tasks. This matches the ground truth content perfectly. However, under utmost strictness, significant points are deducted for deviations from the specified output format: (1) unrequested introductory sentence, (2) bold markdown formatting on the process name and task lists (absent in ground truth), (3) unrequested parenthetical explanations on each line (adding extra details about sequencing and blocks not called for in the prompt), and (4) minor phrasing like "both run simultaneously" and "all three run simultaneously" which, while accurate, introduce extraneous content. These extras violate the precise instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines; in each line list the tasks of one parallel block separated by commas," resulting in a non-exact match despite semantic perfection. A 10.0 requires pixel-perfect adherence with no additions.
