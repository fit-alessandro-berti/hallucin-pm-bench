**1.0**

The LLM answer is not valid BPMN 2.0 XML: lacks `<?xml>`, `<bpmn:definitions>`, required namespaces (`xmlns:bpmn`), and proper structure. It uses invalid wrappers (`<systemModel>`, `<path>`), hallucinates non-BPMN elements (`<parallelEndEvent>`, nested gateways/tasks), omits ~80% of required elements (e.g., no "Validate the claim", loop via "Request missing information" → re-validate, "Update inventory records", "Close the claim", all 15 sequence flows), uses non-verbatim names (e.g., "Warranty-Replacement v1.3" ≠ "Online warranty claim submitted"), incorrect/incomplete gateways (no proper exclusive for completeness/warranty, malformed parallel split/join), and only 2 pseudo-end events without proper flows. Semantically incoherent and unparseable.
