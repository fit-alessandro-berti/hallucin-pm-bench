9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies all required changes (added: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject; removed: Reject Loan; gateway: Exclusive to Inclusive for Gateway_Decision) with no factual errors, omissions, or extraneous details, fully aligning with the prompt's strict focus on the three headings and ignoring renamings/cosmetics. Semantic content matches the ground truth perfectly.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting mismatches** (significant deduction: -0.5 each, totaling -1.0): LLM uses unbolded plain headings and bullet points (-), while ground truth uses markdown-bolded headings (* **Heading** *) and numbered lists (1., 2.). Task presentation reverses the order (ID first, then (name)) vs. ground truth's name first in bold (**name**) followed by (`ID`).
- **Minor wording/detail gaps** (moderate deduction: -0.5 total): Gateway description is concise ("Exclusive â†’ Inclusive") but lacks ground truth's explanatory additions (e.g., "(XOR)" and "(OR)", "in *v1* to ... in *v2*"), which provide precise BPMN terminology and versioning context. No header ("## **Expected Answer Key**") or closing note ("(No other ... present.)").
- No other errors, but these small stylistic/precision differences reflect ~10% deviation from exact ground truth structure, justifying the score.
