The LLM answer incorrectly places the interrupting boundary timer on Task_RequestDocs instead of Task_Receive, failing to measure the full 48-hour SLA from claim submission (Start_Claim). This only covers delays in the "missing docs" branch after initial tasks, potentially allowing total time to exceed 48 hours in the "complete docs" path or early delays (e.g., in Receive/Check). It does not ensure all claims reach Task_Triage within SLA, rendering the improvement ineffective. Minor positives: uses correct duration (PT48H), adds flow to Task_Triage, and avoids new tasks. However, the core placement error warrants major deduction under strict criteria.
