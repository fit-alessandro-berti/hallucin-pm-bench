The LLM answer is factually correct (Yes, correct minimal sequence T1→T2→T7→T4→T5 reaches {P2,P5} enabling T5 pre-T3). Explanation is accurate, concise (∼70 words <120), and implies markings effectively (e.g., states {P2,P5}).  

Strict deductions (-0.5):  
- No intermediate markings listed (ground truth shows M₁–M₅ for verification).  
- Sequence as comma-list vs. numbered (minor format diff.).  
- Lacks explicit "T3 not occurred" + disabling note (implied but less emphatic).  
Semantically near-identical; superficial differences only.
