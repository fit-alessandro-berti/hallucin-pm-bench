The LLM answer is highly accurate and fully compliant with the prompt: correct top 3 activities ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), verbatim quotes of Avg_Waiting_h and 95p_Waiting_h from the table (preserving decimals like 120.0h), no mention of service-time/throughput/other activities, memo format ≤150 words (~120 words), and one concrete action per activity logically tied to waiting-time reduction with explicit ≥20% target.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Stylistic differences from ground truth (full memo header/subject/closing vs. raw numbered list; "95th-pctl"/"Avg" vs. "p95"/"avg"; "h" vs. " h").
- Action phrasings conceptually similar but not identical (e.g., LLM's "customer portal with automated reminders" vs. GT's "automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation"; no invented "pilot tests"/"estimated 30%" data, which aligns with scoring notes but differs from GT's flavor).

Perfect on correctness, no unwarranted content, relevant data-driven actions per scoring notes.
