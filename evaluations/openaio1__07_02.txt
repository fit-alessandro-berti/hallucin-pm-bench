8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (High marks here)**: The LLM correctly identifies all key changes—three added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), one removed task (Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway type change (exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision). No extraneous changes are mentioned, aligning with the instruction to ignore cosmetics like name tweaks (e.g., "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan") or XML ordering.
- **Differences and Deductions (Strict penalties applied)**:
  - **Task Listings**: Lists only IDs (e.g., "Task_VerifyIdentity") without including the human-readable names (e.g., "Verify Identity"), which the ground truth provides for clarity. This makes the summary less comprehensive, as names are part of the XML and aid understanding—deduct 0.5 points.
  - **Gateway Description**: Uses raw XML tags ("exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway") instead of semantic terms ("exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)"), omitting the BPMN-standard abbreviations and version references (v1/v2). This is technically correct but less precise and explanatory than the ground truth—deduct 0.5 points.
  - **Formatting and Structure**: Headings are in all caps ("ADDED TASKS") rather than the prompt's title case ("Added tasks"), and uses simple bullets instead of the ground truth's numbered lists with bolding and markdown. No final confirmatory note (e.g., "No other changes"). These are small but violate "exactly these headings" and reduce readability—deduct 0.5 points.
- **Overall**: Near-perfect on substance (all changes captured without errors), but strict adherence to detail, formatting, and presentation yields minor but noticeable gaps. No major omissions or inaccuracies justify a lower score.
