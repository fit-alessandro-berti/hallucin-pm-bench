### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from both the prompt requirements and the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key failures include:

- **Incorrect identification of worst-performing activities (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: The prompt requires selection based *jointly* on SLA breaches (throughput > SLA) *and* high waiting times. Data shows Legal Approval (+300s breach, 600s wait), Risk Review (+300s breach, 480s wait), and Credit Assessment (+60s breach, 200s wait) as the clear top three by severity. The LLM erroneously selects Verify Identity (+30s breach, 80s wait) over Legal Approval, ignoring the highest wait and tied-highest breach. This misrepresents data-driven analysis.

- **Inaccurate quantification of SLA exceedances (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: For Risk Review, LLM claims +180s exceedance (600s throughput vs. 300s SLA), but correct is +300sâ€”a factual arithmetic error. Verify Identity's +30s is minor and irrelevant due to wrong selection. Ground truth accurately quantifies all three.

- **Inadequate recommendations (major deduction: -1.0 points)**: Prompt demands "one concrete, data-driven action" per activity, using bullet points only for them. LLM's bullets are vague and generic ("Target... for optimization"; "Focus... efforts"), lacking specificity or data ties (e.g., no metrics-informed steps like staffing or automation). Ground truth provides precise, actionable items (e.g., "Add one risk analyst") with projected impact.

- **Minor structural/invented elements (deduction: -0.5 points)**: Adds invented date ("October 26, 2023"), exceeding ~150 words with fluff. While memo format is present, it includes non-bulleted analysis where ground truth is concise. No invented activities/metrics, but errors compound ungrounded claims (e.g., "second-highest... among the top three").

Overall fidelity is poor: Core analysis is flawed, violating "ground every sentence in the data." Small errors (e.g., phrasing "SLA excursions") are outweighed by systemic issues, but strictness amplifies losses.
