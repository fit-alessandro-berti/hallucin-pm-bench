### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a (Decision Points)**: The LLM incorrectly identifies the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a "decision point" (it is merely an assessment step providing inputs, not a gate or branch). It correctly captures the Step 4 conditional and Step 6 TriVote but adds an extraneous item and uses slightly imprecise wording (e.g., "any two approvals out of three suffice" vs. ground truth's "at least two... record 'Approve'"). Ground truth lists exactly two points; this inflation and misclassification deducts heavily (partial credit for the two accurate summaries: ~4/10).
- **Part b (Documents)**: Major omissions—the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) first appear as inputs in Step 3 and must be listed separately in order. "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is treated as a distinct document in Step 8 (ground truth separates it from the unsigned version in Step 7). Only 5/9 items are present, in roughly correct order among those listed, but incompleteness is a critical failure (2/10).
- **Overall**: Strict assessment for strictness—small errors like wording are penalized, but large structural issues (extra/missing items) dominate. No hallucinations noted, but fidelity to ground truth is low (~30% match in content/coverage).
