4.0

**a) Decision points:**  
The LLM answer over-lists decision points by including the “Tri-Color-Risk-Check” itself, which is just a rating assignment step, not a decision or branching point. The key risk/amount-based branching and the TriVote approval are both addressed, but the LLM answer’s phrasing is less precise than the ground truth’s: it describes the TriVote as requiring all three approvals, but then immediately states “any two out of three suffice”—a confusing and imprecise formulation. Ideally, it would clearly state that the loan passes if at least any two approvers approve. It also lacks clarity in differentiating between steps that are merely assessments (like the risk check) and true gateways/conditionals. The answer is less concise and conceptually faithful than the ground truth.

**b) Required documents:**  
The LLM missed listing the three Scorecard documents (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) as explicit required documents, even though they are distinct named inputs. “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is missing from its list (it only lists Offer Sheet 77 at the binding-offer stage, but the signed version is required at applicant confirmation). Thus, compared to the ground truth, several required documents are omitted.

**Summary:**  
The answer does not hallucinate any extraneous process steps or documents, but it fails to distinguish process gates from non-branching steps, is imprecise about approval logic, and omits several required documents in the required order. These are significant errors for a task that demands strict adherence, so the score is 4.0.
