7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and the two key rule violations (2 and 3), with accurate descriptions of the issues except for a factual error in the distance calculation for rule 3 (states "distance 4" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"). It cites relevant rules but is incomplete, as it omits analysis of rules 1, 4, and 5 (all satisfied per ground truth), reducing thoroughness. Under strict evaluation, these differences—lack of comprehensiveness and the small numerical error—warrant a moderate deduction from a perfect score.
