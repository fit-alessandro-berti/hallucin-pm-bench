**1.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict grading):
- **Major flaws (80% deduction)**: LLM suggests invalid/incomplete BPMN – `timerEventDefinition` in `camunda:extensionElements` directly on a task does nothing (no boundary event, no interruption, no escalation path); fails to enforce SLA (timer "can be used" but isn't connected/utilized). Ignores existing `Activity_AMReview` (explicitly unused/escalation hinted). Introduces proprietary Camunda extensions/namespace absent in pure BPMN 2.0 model.
- **Partial credit (+1.5)**: Identifies correct task (`Activity_CreateAccount`), duration (`PT48H`), and post-`VerifyID` timing intent.
- **Minor flaws (further deduction)**: Extra explanatory text beyond "only changed/added XML + 1-sentence justification"; inaccurate justification (no actual enforcement/escalation); non-standard XML.
- **vs. Ground Truth**: Near-total mismatch – GT uses standard interrupting `boundaryEvent` routed to existing task for true compliance; LLM is non-functional workaround.
