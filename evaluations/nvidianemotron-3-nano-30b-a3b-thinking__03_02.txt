**1.0**

### Evaluation Summary (strict assessment)
The LLM answer fails catastrophically on fidelity to the description, BPMN semantics, JSON structure matching the ground truth schema, and completeness. Key violations (each warranting full deduction under "utmost strictness"):

- **Critical logic error (description violation)**: No "Provide Resolution" for *Complex* tickets. LLM routes Complex directly to merge after "Root Cause Analysis" only; ground truth correctly sequences Root Cause → Provide Resolution (shared). This invents a divergent model, ignoring "before resolution."
- **Wrong parallel modeling**: Fork *after* Send Response to Log + Await (log dangles without outgoing flow or join; process can "end" without logging). Ground truth forks *before* Send/Log (post-Provide Resolution), joins correctly before Await—matches "after resolution drafted, Send... In parallel, Log" and "may finish earlier/later than customer reply."
- **Broken wait/timeout**: "AwaitReply" as plain task → exclusive gateway (no conditions; idiomatic BPMN fail). No intermediate catch events, timer, or event-based gateway. Ground truth uses eventBasedGateway → message/timer catches perfectly for "waits up to 24h... if reply/close immediately; else reminder."
- **Incomplete/missing flows**: No flow *from* "Gateway_ReplyOrTimeout" to "Task_SendReminder" (outgoing claims it, but flows list absent); "Task_LogSolution" has no outgoing; "Task_CloseTicket" → "Task_Terminate" (wrong—Terminate is for cancel only).
- **Schema/structure mismatch**: "processes"/arrays of gateways/tasks vs. ground truth "process_id"/"elements"/"flows". Not equivalent representation.
- **Cancel handling hallucinated/incomplete**: Unattached "Cancel_Message" → "Task_Terminate"; no interrupting catch across process. Ground truth uses "intermediateCatchEvent" properly (though placement implicit).
- **Other errors**: No gateway conditions ("simple"/"complex"); Close → Terminate (hallucinated); no flow to "End_Closed"; combined "Parse & Create" (ground truth separates); extra "Task_Terminate"; invented "Message_Email"/etc.; dangling timer def.
- **No inventions like escalation**, but baseline failures dominate.

Zero functional BPMN equivalence; unparsable/invalid as faithful translation. Minimal partial credit for listing ~most tasks and rough sequence outline.
