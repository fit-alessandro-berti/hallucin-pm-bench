### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: The LLM answer ("1") is correct and directly answers "exactly how many times," matching the ground truth count. However, it omits the word "occurrence" present in the ground truth phrasing, which is a minor but notable deviation under strict evaluation (slight loss: -0.2 points).
- **Question 2**: Exact match ("5.56 %"), including rounding to two decimal places. No deduction.
- **Question 3**: The LLM lists the correct identifier ("A1002"), fulfilling the request to "list the case identifier(s)." The ground truth adds explanatory phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”"), which the LLM omits, making it slightly less precise/verbose but still accurate (minor deduction for not mirroring the full ideal structure: -0.2 points).
- **Question 4**: Both reasons provided by the LLM ("Small sample size" with relevant explanation; "Non-representative temporal coverage" aligning with "Temporal bias") are valid and clearly stated, matching two of the ground truth options. Explanations are detailed and derived solely from the log (no hallucinations). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "temporal coverage" vs. "temporal bias"; added specifics like "day-of-week effects") are present but do not alter correctness (negligible deduction: -0.1 points).

Overall, the response is highly faithful to the ground truth with no substantive errors, hallucinations, or inferences beyond the log. Deductions are applied strictly for small phrasing/structural mismatches, resulting in a near-perfect score.
