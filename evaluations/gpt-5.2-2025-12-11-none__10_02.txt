**1.0**

The LLM answer fails on multiple critical dimensions with utmost strictness applied, resulting in the minimum score:

- **Table structure**: Invalid RACI format (split R/A columns per role + separate C/I columns; non-standard, unreadable). Ground truth uses standard RACI (tasks as rows, roles as columns, single R/A/C/I per cell with bolding).
- **Roles**: Missing "Operations Manager" (present in all ground truth rows); only partial overlap (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support).
- **Tasks**: 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6; extra "Notify..." row; wordings differ significantly (e.g., "Receive customer transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; no "(mandated wording)" header emphasis); omits ground truth's exact phrasings like "Screen Against Sanctions List", "Archive Record".
- **Assignments**: No matching R/A/C/I placements across any row (e.g., row 1: LLM TA=R/A + RL Informed vs. ground truth TA=R, Ops Mgr=A, RL=I, IT=C).
- **Other**: No "Legend"; no end-note on vocabulary/mapping; messy Markdown; ignores conditional "high-risk" nuance in task wording matching ground truth.
- **Vocabulary adherence**: Minor positive (uses "KYC Review", mandated roles), but overwhelmed by differences; does not "organise the RACI matrix clearly".

Total mismatch justifies 1.0; even vocabulary compliance cannot offset structural/content failures.
