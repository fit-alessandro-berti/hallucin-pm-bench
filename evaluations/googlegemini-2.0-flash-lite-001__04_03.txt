3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Compliance Conclusion**: Correctly identifies "No" (matches ground truth). +2.0 points.
- **Rule 1 Assessment**: Incorrectly claims violated, despite acknowledging correct order (QE before RA) and misstating the rule's requirement. This is a major factual error and contradicts the trace. -2.5 points.
- **Rule 2 Assessment**: Correctly satisfied; aligns with ground truth reasoning. +1.5 points.
- **Rule 3 Assessment**: Correctly violated with accurate reasoning (NA before RA). +1.5 points.
- **Rule 4 Assessment**: Incorrectly claims violated, ignoring that CC occurs after NA, RA, and VP in the trace. This is another major factual error. -2.5 points.
- **Justification Quality and Structure**: Provides short justifications referencing rules, but contains logical inconsistencies (e.g., Rule 1) and lacks the precision/clarity of the ground truth table. Minor deductions for format deviation and brevity. -1.0 points.
- **Strictness Applied**: Significant point loss for two rule misassessments (50% error rate on assessments), even though conclusion is correct due to the valid Rule 3 violation. No credit for partial correctness where core facts are wrong.
