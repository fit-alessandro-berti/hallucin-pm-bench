The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without forbidden terms and identifies the single Responsible (R) role per activity based on the process narrative, with no extra tasks or roles added. However, it severely deviates from the ground truth by omitting all Accountable (A) and Consulted (C) assignments—treating them as generic Informed (I)—resulting in an incomplete RACI matrix that ignores key nuances like the Account Manager's accountability and specific consultations. The added note about "Responsible roles only" and the need for more info introduces unwarranted content, further diverging from the expected full matrix. These omissions and simplifications constitute major errors, as RACI requires comprehensive R/A/C/I coverage reflecting the narrative, leading to a low score despite partial correctness on R and vocabulary.
