6.0

**Reasoning:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer strictly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" as required, with no forbidden synonyms or references—this satisfies the vocabulary policy.
- No extraneous roles or activities are introduced.

**Significant Issues (strict scoring):**
1. **RACI Assignments:**
   - *Accountable ("A")* roles are not assigned anywhere in the LLM answer, even though the ground truth clearly marks "A" (or "R/A") for several activities (e.g., Order Vetting, Notify Customer, etc.). This is a severe omission: "Accountability" is fundamental in RACI and the ground truth includes it.
   - The LLM answer uses “I” (Informed) for almost everyone except the Responsible, whereas the ground truth distinguishes between "C" (Consulted) and "I" with much more care and distribution (e.g., Compliance Officer as "Consulted" for Receive Application and Order Vetting, Finance Clerk as "Consulted" for KYC Review). Multiple "C" allocations are omitted.
   - It provides only one "Responsible" per activity, which matches the ground truth, but it confuses "C" and "I" nearly everywhere.
2. **Legend/Explanation:** The LLM legend says *“Responsible roles only. Accountable assignments would require additional stakeholder information from FinCo management.”* This is incorrect, as the ground truth answer assigns Accountable roles based solely on the input (and so should the LLM).
3. **Formatting/Presentation:** Slight markdown enhancements are fine, but the legend contains a logic error (above), and the LLM table does not use "bold" to indicate dual R/A assignments or highlight R/A as in the ground truth. This is a minor issue, but it would still reduce the score slightly in a strict rubric.

**Summary:**  
Because the LLM answer fulfills vocabulary policy perfectly and restricts to only the correct activities and roles, it avoids a failing grade. But the significant mishandling and omission of Accountable and Consulted assignments—both of which are fundamental to a correct RACI—lead to a major deduction. These problems are sufficient to drop it to 6.0 given the demand for utmost strictness.
