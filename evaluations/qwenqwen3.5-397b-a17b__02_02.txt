The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content, sequence, distinct elements, ordering, and structure across all questions:
- Q1/A1: Identical (3 distinct cases: C001, C002, C003).
- Q2/A2: Identical sequence for C002 (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order); escaping in ground truth (\_) is a rendering artifact, not a content difference.
- Q3/A3: Identical distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), one per line, alphabetically ordered (A before C). Prefixes/dashes/<br> in ground truth are extraneous formatting not required by the prompt.

No extras, omissions, fabrications, or errors; perfect adherence.
