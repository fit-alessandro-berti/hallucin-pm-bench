### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the core branching elements from the process description (eligibility check, high-value threshold, and the pre-approval/auditor steps). The complete list of required documents matches the ground truth exactly (all 7 items, no extras introduced, and correctly notes AuditTrail's conditional use without fabricating artefacts). It adheres to the prompt by not mentioning undefined activities (e.g., no "CustomerService_Agent_Decide") and structures the response clearly.
  
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions)**: The evaluation must be strictly aligned with the ground truth, where only 3 explicit decision points are summarized (eligibility, amount threshold, and consolidated final approval). The LLM inflates this to 6 decision points, incorrectly treating non-branching steps as decisions (e.g., "Senior auditor review" as a separate binary decision with "Endorsed vs Declined/escalated," which introduces unsubstantiated outcomes; "Payment readiness gate" as an implicit decision, fabricating a check not explicitly described as a decision point; and "Confirmation dispatch" as a "decision" despite admitting no branching). This violates the prompt's directive to summarize *every decision point* without over-interpretation or additions, creating meaningful differences in content and structure (table vs. numbered list with invented details). Small errors like associating documents per "decision" (not in ground truth) and phrasing like "skip Senior_Auditor_Review" (accurate but split unnecessarily) compound the issues, warranting a notable point loss for verbosity and deviation. Overall fidelity is moderate but undermined by expansion beyond the concise, precise ground truth.
