**10.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth with near-perfect fidelity across all questions under strict evaluation:

- **Q1**: Identical count ("1"); "occurrence" is implied by the question phrasing ("how many times does ... occur").
- **Q2**: Exact value ("5.56%"); minor formatting (no space before %) is negligible, as the prompt specifies "round to two decimal places" without dictating spacing or calculation display.
- **Q3**: Precise list ("A1002"); ground truth's verbose phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains ...") exceeds the question's "list the case identifier(s)" requirement.
- **Q4**: Provides exactly two clear, sampling-related reasons directly aligning with ground truth examples ("Temporal bias" via "limited temporal scope/single day" and "Small sample size" via "insufficient sample size/18 events/sparsity/high variance"). No hallucinations or unjustified inferences; sticks to log-derived facts (18 events, 4 cases, 1 occurrence, 1-day span).
