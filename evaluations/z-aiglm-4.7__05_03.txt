The LLM answer is semantically and functionally identical to the ground truth, correctly reusing the unused escalation task with an interrupting 48-hour boundary timer on "Activity_CreateAccount" to enforce the SLA without new activities. However, under utmost strictness, deduct 0.8 points total for minor XML differences: (1) extraneous `<bpmn:outgoing>Flow_Escalation</bpmn:outgoing>` (not present in ground truth or original model style, +0.3); (2) missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<bpmn:timeDuration>` (inconsistent with original XML's conditionExpression style, +0.3); (3) non-matching IDs, event name, comments, and justification wording/formatting (exact-match pedantry, +0.2).
