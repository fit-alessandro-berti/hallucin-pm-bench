### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer adheres to the vocabulary mandate (e.g., "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and covers all core tasks from the source text in Markdown table format, earning baseline points for compliance with the prompt's structural requirements. However, it deviates significantly from the ground truth in several strict, score-impacting ways:

- **Format and Structure (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: The LLM uses a traditional RACI column layout (Activity | R | A | C | I), while the ground truth uses a role-based column layout (Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | Operations Manager | IT Support) with R/A/C/I symbols in cells and a legend. This is a fundamental mismatch in presentation, despite both being valid RACI formats. The LLM's use of "N/A" for empty cells contrasts with the ground truth's complete filling of roles, reducing clarity and completeness.

- **Task Wording and Coverage (moderate deduction: -1.5 points)**: Tasks are mostly aligned but reworded inconsistently (e.g., LLM's "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM separates "Ensure SWIFT message transmission" as a distinct row, while ground truth integrates it into "Release Payment"). The LLM's "Archive case file" vs. ground truth's "Archive Record" is a minor but unnecessary variation. No omissions, but the extra granularity in SWIFT introduces misalignment.

- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: Core differences in role distributions severely undermine accuracy. The LLM oversimplifies by assigning most R and A to the primary actor (e.g., Transaction Analyst R/A for receive/log and screen; Regulatory Liaison R/A for KYC and approve) with sparse C/I, ignoring broader consultations. The ground truth distributes responsibilities more collaboratively, often with Operations Manager as A (absent entirely in LLM, a critical gap) and frequent C/I across roles (e.g., IT Support C in screening/release; Transaction Analyst C in KYC/approve/archive). Partial overlaps exist (e.g., Regulatory Liaison R for KYC/approve; IT Support R for archive), but no row fully matches, reflecting widespread errors in accountability and involvement.

Overall, while the LLM is functional and mandate-compliant, its simplistic, non-distributed RACI logic and omissions (e.g., no Operations Manager) result in low fidelity to the ground truth, justifying a low score under strict criteria. Small wording variances and N/A usage compound the issues without redeeming them.
