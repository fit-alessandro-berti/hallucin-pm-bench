The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, matching the core content of the ground truth. However, under utmost strictness:  
- Missing descriptive labels ("Set 1 – first parallel block:", etc.) deducts 1.0 point.  
- Uses "and" instead of "‖" symbol deducts 0.5 points.  
- Different markdown for task names (**bold** vs. `backticks`) deducts 0.5 points.  
- Lacks the closing sentence ("No other tasks...") deducts 0.0 points (not required by prompt, minor omission).  
No factual errors, but formatting/structural differences prevent a perfect score.
