**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it wrongly concludes **No** (impossible) with a flawed proof that reverses the inhibitor arc logic (claims p4=0 *only after* T3, but T3 populates p4 from p2, so p4=0 *before* T3). This directly contradicts the ground truth's **Yes**, complete firing sequence (T1→T2→T5→T3→T4), and precise justification. No partial credit; the error inverts the net's behavior and ignores the reachable marking after T2 (p3=1, p4=0, enabling T5 pre-T3).
