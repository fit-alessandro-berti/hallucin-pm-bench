The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth for all components:

1. Correctly identifies 1 occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check".
2. Calculates the correct percentages for both (a) events (2.08%) and (b) unique cases (8.33%) and rounds them as required.
3. The explanation for question 3 ticks all requirements: it notes the single-occurrence, describes how this can skew averages and predictive models (i.e., variance/instability), and gives a direct warning against generalization.

There are no errors or omissions. The answer is strictly faithful to the provided data and reflects the expected strictness.
