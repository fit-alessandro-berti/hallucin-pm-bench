3.0

- The LLM answer gets the four mandated terms correct—no unauthorized synonyms are present. 
- However, there are critical deviations from the ground truth that warrant significant point deductions:

**Major errors:**
1. **Intake Vetting:** The answer splits "R" (Front-Office Analyst) and "A" (Compliance Officer), whereas the ground truth correctly combines "R, A" under Front-Office Analyst. Compliance Officer should not be Accountable here.
2. **KYC Review/AML Screening:** Both assign "A" (Accountable) to Compliance Officer, while ground truth assigns "R, A" solely to Compliance Analyst—this is a major misattribution.
3. **Risk Scoring:** "A" assigned to Compliance Officer, but the ground truth only puts "A" and not "R" on Compliance Officer. Also, missing "C" on Front-Office Analyst and incorrect "I" on Treasury Ops.
4. **Escalation Approval (Compliance Officer Approval):** The LLM answer includes roles not listed in the ground truth, renames/mangles the activity ("Escalation Approval" instead of "Compliance Officer Approval"), and gives wrong RACI assignments.
5. **Payment Scheduling:** This is not present in the ground truth, violating "do not add activities."
6. **Fund Release:** Activity is misnamed ("Fund Release" should be "Release Funds"); also marking of RACI does not match the ground truth (has "A" and "R" for Treasury Ops, whereas ground truth includes all "C" for three roles).

**Formatting and fidelity:**
- Several activities do not exactly match the ground truth (extra "Payment Scheduling" and use of "Escalation Approval" instead of "Compliance Officer Approval"). 
- Some incorrect or missing RACI assignments and consulting/informed entries.
- Conditional logic is ignored (ground truth correctly shows consultation/informing; LLM does not).

**Minor positives:**
- All four key mandated terms are present and used strictly; no forbidden synonyms leak in.

**Conclusion:**  
There are both conceptual and structural errors (incorrect, missing, split, or invented RACI lines and improper Accountable designations). The only major thing done right is obeying the vocabulary policy, so the score must be harsh: **3.0**.
