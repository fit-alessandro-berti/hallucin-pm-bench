The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Added and renamed activities**: The prompt explicitly instructs not to add, rename, or merge activities, yet the LLM introduces three unauthorized rows ("Escalation Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release") not present in the ground truth or directly mandated, while the ground truth uses "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" to cover escalation and execution without unnecessary splitting. This alone merits severe deduction for violating core instructions.

- **Incorrect RACI assignments across core activities**:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM assigns R to Front-Office Analyst (partial match), but wrongly gives I to Compliance Analyst (should be C), A to Compliance Officer (should be –), and blank to Treasury Ops (should be I). Major mismatch.
  - **KYC Review**: LLM gives R to Compliance Analyst and A to Compliance Officer (incorrect; ground truth has R,A for Compliance Analyst, C for Officer, I for Treasury Ops, – for Front-Office). Misplaces accountability and omits involvement.
  - **AML Screening**: Identical errors to KYC Review—R for Compliance Analyst and A for Officer (should mirror ground truth's R,A for Analyst, C for Officer, etc.).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Partial match (R for Compliance Analyst, A for Officer), but omits C for Front-Office Analyst and I for Treasury Ops.

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Blanks in cells (vs. ground truth's explicit – for no involvement) and inconsistent bolding/emphasis.

- **Vocabulary adherence**: The four mandated terms are used correctly without leaks of disallowed synonyms, which prevents a total zero but does not offset the structural and assignment errors.

Even minor RACI discrepancies (e.g., missing C/I roles) compound to show poor fidelity to the process narrative and ground truth, justifying substantial point loss.
