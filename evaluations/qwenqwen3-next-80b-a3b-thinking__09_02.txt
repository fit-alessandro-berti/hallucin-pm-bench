The LLM answer accurately identifies the impossibility of calculation due to the absence of timestamp data, mirroring the ground truth's core reasoning on missing timing information and event counts alone. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and slight elaboration on "artefacts" and "lifecycle event counts") do not introduce errors or deviate from the prompt's requirement for a concise explanation, maintaining equivalence in content and brevity.
