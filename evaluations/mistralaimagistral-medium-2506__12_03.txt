8.0

The LLM answer makes the correct overall judgment ("No") and provides precise counterexamples, specifically identifying both C002 and C004 as violating cases, which matches the ground truth's core elements. The justification is accurate, explaining the intervening activities and explicitly listing the violating cases.

However, there are some small but important discrepancies:
- The LLM answer initially analyzes only C004 as a counterexample, and only upon "closer inspection" is C002's violation clarified. This could be perceived as a lack of initial thoroughness.
- The answer does not provide a clear case-by-case tabular breakdown as in the ground truth; though not strictly required, this makes the ground truth answer clearer and more systematic.
- The LLM does not explicitly state which cases *do* conform to the FACT in a tabular or systematic way.
- There is some repetition (e.g., stating "final answer," boxes, etc.) that adds verbosity but no substance.

These small lapses in completeness, organization, and clarity warrant a reduction from a perfect score, but the LLM answer is otherwise correct and well justified. Thus, 8.0 is appropriate.
