9.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Accuracy (High Fidelity)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall verdict ("No") and pinpoints the exact violations (C002 and C004 due to intervening activities "Pack_Items" and "Check_Fraud," respectively), while noting compliance in C001 and C003. This matches the ground truth's case-by-case analysis and conclusion that the "always" claim is inaccurate due to exceptions. No factual errors in the log interpretation or sequences cited.
- **Justification Quality**: The reasoning is comprehensive, evidence-based (citing timestamps and CaseIDs), and directly addresses the task. It effectively disproves the FACT with counterexamples, similar to the ground truth's table-based breakdown.
- **Differences and Deductions (Strict Assessment)**:
  - **Sloppy Presentation (-1.0 point)**: The initial justification contains a contradictory statement ("Cases C001, C002, and C003 do follow... [but] C002... violates"), creating momentary confusion before the immediate "Revised Answer" correction. This is a small but noticeable writing inconsistency absent in the ground truth's clean, precise table format. Under utmost strictness, such lapses in clarity warrant a deduction.
  - **Structural Additions**: The "Revised Answer," "Final Answer," and extraneous \boxed{} are not in the ground truth and slightly inflate the response beyond the task's requirements (Yes/No + justification). This adds minor noise but does not introduce errors.
  - No other differences (e.g., no missed cases, no incorrect timestamps, no overgeneralizations). Overall, differences are superficial and stylistic, not substantive, supporting a high score despite the strict criteria.
