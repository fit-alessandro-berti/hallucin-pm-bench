The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate), key evidence (reversed order in Cases 1001 and 1003, absence in Case 1002 disproving "always"), and conclusion (no supporting instances). Minor deductions for structural differences (e.g., no explicit "short verdict" header, activity numbering vs. line citations, phrasing like "non-adjacently" vs. direct reversal emphasis) and slightly less concise bullets, but no factual errors or omissions.
