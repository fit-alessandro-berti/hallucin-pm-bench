6.5

**Evaluation Reasoning** (strict assessment):  
- **Correct overall answer ("No")**: Matches ground truth (+2.0 base).  
- **Identifies key violation (Rule 3)**: Correctly pinpoints NA before RA (+2.0).  
- **Rule 1 & 2 assessments**: Correct in final summary (QE before RA once each; VP after both for High severity), but major deductions for contradictory phrasing ("Violated" then backtrack to "not violated" = confusing, misleading reasoning; -1.5).  
- **Rule 4**: Calls it "irrelevant" vs. ground truth's clear "✔ Satisfied" (minor difference but error in full assessment; -0.5).  
- **Structure & clarity**: Messy, repetitive, non-tabular vs. ground truth's precise table; lacks conciseness (-1.0).  
- **Strictness applied**: Internal contradictions and imprecise language are significant flaws despite correct conclusion/summary; no perfect match.
