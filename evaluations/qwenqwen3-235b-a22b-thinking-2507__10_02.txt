3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
With utmost strictness, the LLM answer earns a low score due to substantial deviations from the ground truth in structure, content, role inclusion, task definition, and RACI assignments. While it adheres to the vocabulary mandate (correctly using "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst" without prohibited terms), it introduces errors and expansions that significantly diverge from the ground truth's concise mapping of the source text. Small inconsistencies (e.g., task naming variations) compound to major losses, as per the strict evaluation criteria. Below is a breakdown:

#### 1. **Vocabulary and Terminology (Partial Credit: ~7/10)**
   - **Strengths**: Strictly follows mandated terms—no use of "CDD," "Compliance Officer," or "Payment Clerk." Tasks like "KYC Review" are used appropriately.
   - **Errors/Differences**:
     - Task names deviate: e.g., LLM's "Initiate Transfer Instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review" adds "Perform" (not in mandated or source phrasing); "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record"; "Transmit SWIFT Message" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison" are inventions not matching ground truth's consolidated tasks.
     - Introduction of unsubtle expansions (e.g., splitting source step 5 into separate "Release Payment" and "Transmit SWIFT Message") creates extra tasks absent in ground truth, violating the prompt's intent to "cover every task" without additions.
   - **Impact**: Minor phrasing errors (e.g., "High-Risk Transaction" singular vs. ground truth's plural) warrant point deductions, but core terms are intact.

#### 2. **RACI Table Structure and Coverage (Low: ~2/10)**
   - **Strengths**: Presented in Markdown; covers source steps but expands to 8 tasks (vs. ground truth's exact 6, directly mapping the informal description without splits).
   - **Errors/Differences**:
     - **Roles**: LLM omits "Operations Manager" (present in all ground truth rows as the primary **A**), using only three columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support). This ignores the ground truth's role for accountability, fundamentally altering the matrix. Prompt mandates terms for activities/roles, but ground truth's inclusion suggests it's the reference standard—LLM's exclusion is a critical mismatch.
     - **Task Granularity**: LLM over-expands source text (e.g., separate rows for "Transmit SWIFT Message" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison" from steps 5-6, not in ground truth, which consolidates into "Release Payment" and "Archive Record"). Ground truth maps precisely: no extras, no "IT Support" as R/A in notifications.
     - **Omissions/Substitutions**: No coverage for ground truth's exact phrasing (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" directly from step 1); LLM's "Initiate" rephrases inaccurately. Step 3's "on both sender and beneficiary" is implied but not reflected distinctly.
     - **Legend/Key**: LLM's is detailed but placed after; ground truth's is post-table and simpler. LLM's extra "Key" section is unnecessary bloat.

#### 3. **RACI Assignments (Very Low: ~1/10)**
   - **Strengths**: Follows RACI basics (one A per row, using R/A for combined in some cases); no invalid entries.
   - **Errors/Differences**: Assignments differ in nearly every cell, showing poor alignment with ground truth's mappings:
     - **Receive/Initiate (Row 1)**: LLM: R (Analyst), A (Liaison), I (IT). Ground: **R** (Analyst), I (Liaison), **A** (Operations), C (IT). Mismatch on A and IT's role.
     - **Screen (Row 2)**: LLM: R (Analyst), C (Liaison). Ground: **R** (Analyst), **A** (Liaison? No, A is Operations), I (Operations), C (IT). Wrong A and missing IT.
     - **KYC Review (Row 3)**: LLM: I (Analyst), R (Liaison), I (IT). Ground: C (Analyst), **R** (Liaison), **A** (Operations), I (IT). Swapped involvements; missing Operations A.
     - **Approve (Row 4)**: LLM: R/A (Liaison). Ground: C (Analyst), **R** (Liaison), **A** (Operations), I (IT). Incomplete roles.
     - **Release (Row 5)**: LLM: R (Analyst), C (Liaison). Ground: **R** (Analyst), I (Liaison), **A** (Operations), C (IT). Missing A and IT.
     - **Archive (Row 6 in ground)**: LLM splits into two rows with I/R/A variations. Ground: C (Analyst), I (Liaison), **A** (Operations), **R** (IT). Extra rows and wrong assignments.
     - No ground truth equivalent for LLM's extra "Transmit" (I Analyst, R/A IT) or "Notify" (- Analyst, I Liaison, R IT) tasks—these are unsubstantiated additions.
   - **Impact**: RACI is the core deliverable; pervasive mismatches (especially consistent absence of Operations Manager as A) indicate failure to replicate ground truth logic. R/A notation in LLM is a small but invalid deviation (ground uses bold **A** separately).

#### 4. **Overall Adherence to Prompt and Source (Low: ~2/10)**
   - **Strengths**: Maps source steps creatively; rationale shows understanding of mandates.
   - **Errors/Differences**:
     - Adds unrequested "Rationale" section (detailed but extraneous—prompt specifies only the Markdown table).
     - Expands beyond "every task" into interpretive splits (e.g., logging implied in "Initiate," SWIFT as separate), while ground truth sticks to source without embellishment.
     - Ground truth notes emphasize "without omissions or substitutions"—LLM substitutes and adds, e.g., "case file" vs. "record."
     - No bolding or exact formatting match (ground uses **bold** for R/A/C/I in cells).

#### Scoring Calculation
- Total possible: 10.0 (perfect match).
- Deductions: -3.0 (role omissions, especially Operations Manager); -2.5 (task mismatches/expansions); -2.0 (RACI assignment errors); -1.0 (extra content/phrasing variances); +2.0 partial credit for vocabulary and Markdown.
- **Final: 3.5**—Recognizes effort in mandates but penalizes heavily for not mirroring ground truth's precise, consolidated structure and assignments. A stricter benchmark would drop it lower, but minimal source coverage prevents a 1.0.
