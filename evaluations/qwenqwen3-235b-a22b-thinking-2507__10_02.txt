5.0

- **Vocabulary Compliance**: The LLM strictly avoids forbidden terms and consistently applies "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst". (+2 points)
- **Structure and Formatting**: The table is in Markdown as requested, is clearly laid out, and includes a legend. (+1 point)
- **Mapping of Source Steps**: Main required steps are visible, but some activity labels differ from the ground truth (e.g., "Initiate Transfer Instruction" vs "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Transmit SWIFT Message" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison" are not mapped in the ground truth; "Archive Case File" not "Archive Record" using the specific preferred phrasing). These differences are nontrivial. (−1.5 points)
- **Roles Included**: The LLM omits "Operations Manager," which exists in the ground truth. Its absence means all "Accountable" responsibilities are inaccurately mapped (as ground truth has Operations Manager as "A" in every task). This is a major deviation. (−2.5 points)
- **RACI Assignments**: Some assignments differ from the ground truth:
    - For example, "Screen Against Sanctions List": Ground truth says Transaction Analyst (R), Regulatory Liaison (A); LLM says Transaction Analyst (R), Regulatory Liaison (C).
    - "KYC Review": Ground truth has Regulatory Liaison (R), Operations Manager (A); LLM has Regulatory Liaison (R/A), omitting separate accountability.
    - "Approve High-Risk Transaction": Ground truth has Regulatory Liaison (R), Operations Manager (A); LLM assigns both R and A to Regulatory Liaison.
    - "Archive Record": Ground truth makes IT Support [R], Operations Manager [A]; LLM splits R/A between IT Support or doesn't clarify this mapping precisely.
    - Several roles are marked "I" or "C" incorrectly or omitted.
    (−1 point)
- **Task Granularity**: The LLM adds extra or slightly different steps (e.g., "Notify Regulatory Liaison," "Transmit SWIFT Message") that are not present in the ground truth RACI nor mandated by the original process. This expands scope in a way not directed by the prompt. (−1 point)
- **Overall Adherence to Instructions**: Deviations from the exact task/role structure of the ground truth, some incorrect RACI assignments, omission of a specified role, and rephrased activities represent significant but not catastrophic errors.

**Summary**: The LLM demonstrates solid vocabulary discipline and overall RACI table clarity, but makes significant errors by omitting a role ("Operations Manager"), not aligning key "Accountable" assignments, using task names and distribution of responsibilities that deviate from the provided ground truth. Partial credit is due for terminology and partial mapping, but strict grading per the request and the mandated vocabulary/structure yield a score of 5.0.
