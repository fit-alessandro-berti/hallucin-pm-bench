**8.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies and summarizes **all** required changes with perfect accuracy in content (exact added tasks: Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject; removed: Task_RejectLoan; gateway change: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision). No extraneous changes mentioned, and ignores renamings/flows as instructed.

**Strengths (no point loss):**
- All changes grouped under the three exact required headings (minor casing/plural variations like "Tasks" vs "tasks", "Type" vs "type" are cosmetic and retain recognizability).
- Comprehensive and precise.

**Deductions (1.5 points total loss from 10.0, per strictness):**
- Extra unnecessary title "# BPMN Change Analysis..." (+0.5 loss: deviates from direct heading start).
- Tables vs. ground truth's numbered lists (+0.5 loss: structural difference).
- ID-first then name vs. ground truth's bolded name-first then `(ID)` (+0.3 loss: reversed presentation order).
- Full XML types (`exclusiveGateway`) vs. descriptive "**exclusive** (XOR)" (+0.2 loss: wording/style mismatch).

No other errors; highly faithful overall despite format variances.
