7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (Accuracy: 10/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies the exact count as 1 and specifies the case (1002), aligning closely with the ground truth's implicit details (case and time). No errors; minor addition of case detail enhances without deviation.
- **Q2 (Accuracy: 5/10; Completeness: 7/10; Relevance: 8/10)**: The response stays under 120 words (~85) and addresses core issues like small sample (3 cases), limited time window (March 1), and potential over/under-representation due to unobserved factors (rules, volume, triggers). However, it misses critical ground truth elements: quantitative sampling error (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence interval), rare event volatility in tiny excerpts (14 events/<2 hours), and specific near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing strict/fuzzy matching distortions. These omissions reduce depth and data-tied insight, leading to significant point loss per strict criteria.
- **Overall**: Strong on basics but lacks nuance and precision in statistical/explanatory pitfalls, justifying 7.5 as a balanced but penalized score.
