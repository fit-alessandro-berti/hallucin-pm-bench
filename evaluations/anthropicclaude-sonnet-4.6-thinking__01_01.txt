### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major differences, -3.0 points)**: Ground truth identifies **3 explicit decision points** with precise branching logic/outcomes in a table format. LLM correctly identifies and describes **2/3** (eligibility check and amount threshold match closely in location, logic, and outcomes). However, LLM explicitly claims "**two decision points**" and **omits the third** ("Final payment approval" at Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review, with Approved → payment / Rejected → end). This is a significant content omission, as the process constraints imply success/failure outcomes there (e.g., "has succeeded", "has been completed"). Inconsistent treatment of triage (pass/fail included) vs. later approvals (not highlighted). Structure (descriptive bullets vs. GT table) is secondary but adds minor divergence.
- **Required Documents (Perfect match, +10/10)**: Identical complete list (7 documents), including conditional note for AuditTrail. LLM's table with "Used In" is accurate/extra helpful (no new artefacts introduced), matching GT's "catalogue" intent and end note on no legacy items.
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity**: Well-formatted and adheres to prompt (no new activities/artefacts; notes legacy exclusion). But core incompleteness on "every decision point" (prompt mandate) and wrong count warrant heavy penalty under strict rules. No small errors; this is substantive (33% missing content). Total reflects ~65-70% alignment.
