3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially captures the structure and core mandated vocabulary (e.g., "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") but deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences and errors include:

- **Missing Role/Column**: The ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a column with frequent "A" (Accountable) assignments (e.g., in 5/6 tasks). The LLM omits this entirely, using only three columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support). This is a major structural omission, as RACI tables require complete role coverage, and it alters accountability assignments across the board.

- **RACI Assignments Inaccuracies** (significant point loss per task, as even minor mismatches are penalized heavily):
  - "Receive Customer Instruction & Log in System": LLM assigns I to Regulatory Liaison (correct), but ground truth explicitly has A for Operations Manager (missing). C for IT Support matches.
  - "Screen Payment against Sanctions List": Mostly aligns (R for Transaction Analyst, A for Regulatory Liaison, C for IT Support), but ground truth has I for Operations Manager (omitted).
  - "Perform KYC Review (Sender & Beneficiary)": LLM incorrectly combines R and A under Regulatory Liaison; ground truth separates R (Regulatory Liaison) and A (Operations Manager), with C for Transaction Analyst (LLM has C, correct) and I for IT Support (matches).
  - "Approve High-Risk Transaction Flag": Major errors—LLM has I for Transaction Analyst (ground truth: C), combines R,A for Regulatory Liaison (ground: R for Regulatory Liaison, A for Operations Manager), and "-" for IT Support (ground: I).
  - "Release Payment & Ensure SWIFT Message Sent": Combines two source elements (release + SWIFT) into one task, unlike ground truth's singular "Release Payment". Assignments mostly align for existing roles (R Transaction Analyst, I Regulatory Liaison, C IT Support), but misses A for Operations Manager.
  - "Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison": LLM has I for Transaction Analyst (ground: C), C for Regulatory Liaison (ground: I), and combines R,A for IT Support (ground: R for IT Support, A for Operations Manager). Notification is explicitly in LLM's task title but not in ground truth's phrasing.

- **Task Phrasing and Coverage**:
  - LLM's tasks are not identically worded or structured: e.g., "Receive Customer Instruction & Log in System" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review (Sender & Beneficiary)" adds unnecessary detail and doesn't bold "**KYC Review**" as mandated/emphasized; "Approve High-Risk Transaction Flag" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions"; combined "Release Payment & Ensure SWIFT Message Sent" vs. separate/single "Release Payment"; "Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison" vs. "Archive Record" (adds explicit notification, altering scope).
  - All source steps are covered without omissions, but combinations and rephrasing introduce differences, violating the "map every step... without omissions or substitutions" note in ground truth.

- **Formatting and Additional Elements**:
  - LLM adds an unnecessary title ("## AtlasRemit Payment Processing - RACI Table"), which ground truth lacks.
  - No legend (e.g., "R = Responsible...") in LLM, while ground truth includes it explicitly.
  - Ground truth uses a header like "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" and bolds mandated terms (e.g., "**KYC Review**", "**R**"); LLM lacks this precision and emphasis.
  - Markdown table is present in both, but LLM's is less aligned in column count and styling.

These issues—especially the missing role, reassigned accountabilities, and phrasing mismatches—represent substantial deviations, not minor ones. The answer is functional but fails to strictly replicate the ground truth's completeness, accuracy, and mandated organization, justifying a score below 5.0. A perfect match would require identical roles, tasks, assignments, and formatting.
