The LLM answer accurately captures the core impossibility due to redacted timestamps and lack of raw event data in Artefact A, mirroring the ground truth's emphasis on absent concrete times for "Approve Invoice" and inability to compute metrics like average cycle time, dispersion (SD/CI). It correctly avoids guesses and ties limitations to the artefacts without external assumptions. Minor deductions for verbosity (e.g., numbered structure, added summary, explanatory note on cycle time calculation, and signature), which introduce slight extraneous content not present in the concise ground truth; additionally, mentioning "number of observations" as a specific omission is a small elaboration beyond the ground truth's focus, though logically sound.
