9.0

The LLM answer is correct in its overall judgment: it clearly states that the required metrics cannot be computed due to the absence of raw timestamp data in Artefact A (the event log). It accurately explains that the average cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval cannot be calculated and gives clear reasoning: missing start and complete times, absence of row data, and the inadequacy of high-level KPI summary information.

However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer is more verbose than necessary and contains slight over-explanation (e.g., explicitly mentioning variance, inferential statistics, and not borrowing from Artefact B even though that's already implicit from the instructions). The last note about "Theoretical inferences or guesses" is unnecessary since the prompt already restricts this. The sign-off ("Process-Mining Team") is a stylistic addition, not found in the ground truth and not requested.

A strict assessment penalizes these stylistic and minor redundancy deviations, resulting in a 1-point deduction. Content-wise, the answer is fully correct and precise on the core points, but the verbosity and added explanations are not strictly aligned with the concise style of the ground truth, meriting a 9.0.
