7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (High Match, Minimal Deduction)**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). No extraneous or missing functional changes. This aligns perfectly with the ground truth and prompt requirements (1.0 deduction avoided here).
- **Formatting Errors (Significant Deduction)**: 
  - Missing "-" bullets before every item in all sections (3 in ADDED TASKS, 1 in REMOVED TASKS, 2 in GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES), which is a consistent mismatch from the ground truth's structured list format. This is a small but repeated error across 6 items, warranting strict point loss (-1.5 total).
  - GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES includes extraneous "*« »*" wrappers and asterisks (e.g., "*«exclusive → parallel»*"), deviating from the ground truth's plain "exclusive → parallel" and the prompt's example (`Gateway_X: exclusive → parallel`). This literal misinterpretation of the format notation is an avoidable error (-1.0).
  - Minor alignment issue in ground truth for the second gateway (extra spaces for padding), absent in LLM but negligible (-0.0).
- **Overall Structure and Adherence**: Headings are verbatim and in order, no commentary or unchanged elements mentioned, and output is concise. No violations of prompt rules like guessing intentions. Strictness applied: formatting is not optional for a full match, leading to deductions despite strong content fidelity. Total score reflects ~75% exact match due to these precise differences.
