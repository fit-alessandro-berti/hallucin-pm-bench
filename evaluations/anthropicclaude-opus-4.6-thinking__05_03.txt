**9.2**

The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth (correctly adds an interrupting PT48H boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` routing to the existing `Activity_AMReview` via a new sequence flow, using no new activities, with accurate one-sentence justification), but deducts 0.8 for minor XML differences (different element IDs/names, extraneous `id="TimerDef_01"` on `timerEventDefinition`) and formatting variances (comment styles) that deviate from exact syntactic match under strict evaluation, plus minor deduction for unrequested explanatory headers and ASCII diagram violating "return **only** the changed or added XML elements ... and a one-sentence justification."
