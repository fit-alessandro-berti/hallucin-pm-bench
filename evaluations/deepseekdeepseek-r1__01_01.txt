7.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM correctly identifies the main decision points (eligibility check, high-value threshold, approvals).
- Nearly all process documents are present and correctly associated with their process steps.
- The prohibition of the legacy activity is included as a note.

**Major Issues:**
- **Omission of a Decision Point:** The critical "Amount threshold" branching immediately after *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* (determining if Senior_Auditor_Review is required) is only described as part of the review, not as an explicit process split/branch.
- **Incomplete Decision Logic:** The LLM does not specify possible outcomes (e.g., claim rejected, payment ends, etc.) for each decision—especially for the Triage check and the final financial approval. The outcomes and what happens in each branch are missing, but present in the ground truth.
- **Required Document Missing:** "RefundConfirmationPDF" is omitted in the list of required documents.

**Other Minor Accuracy Issues:**
- "BankTransferAuthorization" is only implied as a requirement for payment step, not itemized in the decision logic itself.
- “AuditTrail” is described as “mandatory for high-value refunds”, which is accurate, but the conditionality (only for > €1 000) is not stressed as clearly as in the ground truth.

**Summary:**  
The answer is reasonable and covers most requirements, but it omits explicit branching logic, outcomes for each decision, and one document. Per strict grading, these result in a significant penalty.
