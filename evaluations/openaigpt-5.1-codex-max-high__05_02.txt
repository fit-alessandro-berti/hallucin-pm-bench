The LLM answer proposes the identical XML diff change (modifying `Task_CollectEquipment` dueDate from P5D to P2D) as the ground truth, fully complying with rules (one attribute modification, no add/delete, single improvement). Minor deductions: (1) diff hunk lacks the closing `@@` present in ground truth (-0.4); (2) rationale is a valid one-sentence explanation addressing the bottleneck but differs in wording/specificity (no explicit "from 5 days to 2 days," no "3-day SLA" reference, no "without introducing new activities," less bolded formatting) (-0.4). Utmost strictness applied, but core match is near-perfect.
