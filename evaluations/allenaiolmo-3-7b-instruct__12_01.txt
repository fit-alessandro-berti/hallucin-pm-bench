**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Accurately describes sequences for all 3 cases (+1.5); cites case IDs and activities correctly (+1.0); recognizes absence/misordering in all cases (+1.0); stays data-bound without guessing (+0.7).
- **Major Errors (heavy deductions)**: 
  - **Wrong core verdict (-3.0)**: Claims "insufficient to confirm" and "insufficient to say... accurate or not", but data **sufficiently disproves** the "always" claim via counterexamples (logic error; contradicts system rule to base strictly on data).
  - **No direct answer to "Is the fact accurate?" (-1.5)**: Evades with hedging instead of "inaccurate/false" like ground truth.
  - **Verbose/mismatched structure (-0.5)**: Lacks concise "short verdict" format; over-explains after correct observations.
  - **Misleading phrasing (-0.3)**: "Pattern does not hold in any" supports inaccuracy, but conclusion contradicts this.
- **Overall**: Analysis ~80% aligned, but verdict failure (key to prompt/ground truth) and strictness mandate drop to mid-low score. Ground truth is precise/disproof-focused; LLM cautious/hedged incorrectly.
