6.5

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM identifies three decision points (Tri-Color-Risk-Check, Conditional Skip, TriVote Decision Gate), whereas the process as described contains two: the risk-based skip after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, and the TriVote approval gate.  
- The LLM splits the Tri-Color-Risk-Check and the conditional skip into two points, but according to the process, the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself is not a decision gate—only the conditional branch that follows is.
- The Tri-Color-Risk-Check is better described as producing a risk rating; the branching after is the decision gate.
- The description for “Conditional Skip in Step 4” is clear and mostly accurate.
- The TriVote Gate is succinctly and correctly summarized.
- Minor imprecision: LLM says “requires at least two approvals from [roles] to proceed,” while the ground truth specifies "at least two of the three approvers... record Approve"; this is a close paraphrase, but a little less clear about whether all three must participate or not (the process notes Sustainability Officer must always participate).

**b) Required Documents**

- The LLM lists the documents in the correct initial order up to number 6, but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" between "Offer Sheet 77" and "ID Matrix Declaration."
- "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is explicitly required at step 8, as in the ground truth. This omission is significant.
- Otherwise, the rest of the documents are listed and in the correct order.

**Other points:**

- No hallucination of KYC or credit-report documents = correct.

**Summary of deductions:**

- Incorrectly splits the Tri-Color-Risk-Check and the conditional skip as two gates. (-0.5)
- Minor imprecision in decision descriptions. (-0.5)
- Major omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" in the document list. (-2.5)

**Final Score:** 6.5
