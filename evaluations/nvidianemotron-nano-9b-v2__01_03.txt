6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 6.0/10):**  
The LLM correctly identifies the two actual decision points (the conditional skip in Step 4 and the TriVote gate in Step 6) but incorrectly adds a third ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check" as a decision point), which is merely an input-generating step, not a gate or conditional branch. This constitutes a significant error in completeness and accuracy, as the ground truth lists only these two. The descriptions of the skip and TriVote are mostly accurate (e.g., correctly capturing the "at least two approvals" rule for TriVote), but the extra point dilutes the summary and introduces confusion, warranting a deduction. Small phrasing differences (e.g., not specifying "record 'Approve'" for TriVote) are minor but still deduct points under strict criteria.

**Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 7.0/10):**  
The list is mostly correct in order and inclusion up to "Offer Sheet 77" (items 1-6 match the ground truth), with no hallucinations (e.g., no improper KYC/AML mentions). However, it fails to distinguish "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate document that first appears in Step 8 (ground truth item 7), incorrectly merging it with the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" from Step 7. This results in an incomplete list (8 items vs. 9) and shifts the order of "ID Matrix Declaration" (LLM's #7 vs. ground truth #8). These omissions and ordering errors are notable inaccuracies for a "required documents" enumeration, leading to a deduction despite the overall strong alignment.

**Overall Score Calculation:** Averaged from parts (weighted equally), with strict penalties for incompleteness (extra/irrelevant item in a) and omission (missing distinct document in b). The answer is helpful and close but not precise, reflecting moderate fidelity to the ground truth.
