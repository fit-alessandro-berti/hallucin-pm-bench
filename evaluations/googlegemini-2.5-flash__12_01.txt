The LLM answer gets the overall verdict correct ("No, the statement is inaccurate") and cites Case 1001 as contradicting the claim. However:

- It only references Case 1001, missing that both Case 1002 (where Update_Inventory does not appear, disproving "always") and Case 1003 (where the order is also reversed) also provide evidence against the claim.
- It only briefly specifies the activity order in Case 1001 and does not systematically list or discuss all relevant cases and activity pairs as in the ground truth.
- It omits mention that in Case 1002, Update_Inventory is absent, which fundamentally disproves "always".

Because the LLM answer provides a limited justification based on incomplete evidence and lacks the rigorous, multi-case, evidence-based analysis required, it deserves a significant deduction, despite achieving the correct overall verdict.
