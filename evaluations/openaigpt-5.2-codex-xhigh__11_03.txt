5.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment). Perfect quantification of SLA excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s), grounded in table data. References case volumes from table. Intro references joint criteria (SLA breaches + high waiting). Uses bullets *only* for recommendations, per instruction #3. No inventions; stays within provided metrics.
- **Major deductions**:
  - **Format/structure (-2.5)**: Lacks executive memo conventions (no "To:", "From:", "Subject:" header as in ground truth). Abrupt "COO," start feels like email body, not memo. No bolding/emphasis on activities/metrics. No closing projection or summary sentence.
  - **Content differences (-1.5)**: Intro phrasing/wording differs significantly (no total cases mention, though ground truth invents "4 805"). Activity order wrong (Risk Review first vs. Legal Approval first in ground truth, despite Legal's higher wait). Includes unnecessary case counts not in ground truth.
  - **Recommendations (-1.0)**: Structure matches (bullets), but content entirely different and less concrete/specific. LLM's generic ("reallocate capacity", "increase capacity", "prioritize queue") vs. ground truth's detailed actions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks", "add one risk analyst"). References data but lacks ground truth's precision/actionability.
- **Word count**: ≈140 words (close to ≈150 target).
- **Overall**: Core facts match (50% credit), but strict format, phrasing, order, and rec content mismatches warrant halving the score. Small issues (e.g., phrasing, order) deduct further per instructions.
