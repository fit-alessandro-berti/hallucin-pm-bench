**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Decision Points (major deficiencies, ~40% of score weight)**: LLM identifies only 2 out of 3 ground truth points (misses **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** entirely, a clear decision with approve/reject vote). Descriptions are superficial and omit critical details: no mention of "≤ 2 points difference", "escalate to Harmonisation Committee", step positions ("after Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), "system auto-approves" for < €15 000, or "send to MBA" for ≥ €15 000. This fails to "summarise" the branching logic, violating strict adherence to process flow and terminology.
- **Required Documents (strong, ~60% of score weight)**: Perfect match on all 6 items with exact names. Minor phrasing diffs (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs "pay-stub/tax slip"; "CIS template" vs "CIS") are negligible, but lacks ground truth's explanatory note (though not strictly required).
- **Overall**: Incomplete and undetailed on core "decision points" (prompt's emphasis), despite good docs list. Strict penalty for omissions/errors drops from potential 10.0.
