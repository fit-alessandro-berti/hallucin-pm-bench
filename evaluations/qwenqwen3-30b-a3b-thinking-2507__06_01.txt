8.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth but with a few notable issues:

- The first pair, "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check", is correct and matches both alphabetically and in form.
- The second pair, "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines", is also correct in content and order.
- However, the ground truth answer has slightly more spacing between "Procure_Materials" and the em dash in the second pair, which the LLM answer did not replicate. Since the instructions ask for strict grading and mention that even small errors should incur a significant loss of points, a formatting mismatch in spacing is counted as an error.
- The LLM answer did not use the requested code block formatting (```) present in the ground truth, though the prompt isn't entirely clear if this is mandatory. Still, being extra strict, this is a minor reason for score reduction.

In summary:  
- All pairs are correct, both in content and ordering.  
- A small formatting/spatial inconsistency is present and code block is missing.  

Deducting 1.5 points for these: **8.5**
