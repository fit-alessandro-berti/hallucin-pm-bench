7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added: `check_vip`, `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), matching the core content of the ground truth. Headings closely follow the prompt's exact specification (including • and bolding).

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Significant deductions (-2.0)**: Uses only raw IDs instead of descriptive names with IDs (e.g., "check_vip" vs. "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`*)"), omitting exact name attributes from XML.
- **Format/style differences (-0.5)**: Plain indented lists without * bullets; lacks backticks, bolding on types, and "(v1)/(v2)" phrasing in gateway.
- **Minor heading variance (-0.5)**: Extra bolding/• placement slightly deviates from ground truth rendering.

No speculation or extra content; no other categories invented. Overall close but not identical, with small-but-strictly-penalized omissions and formatting mismatches.
