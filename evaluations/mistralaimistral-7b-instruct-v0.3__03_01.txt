**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally invalid and incorrect on multiple critical levels, failing strict adherence to the prompt and ground truth:

- **Invalid BPMN 2.0 XML structure**: Sequence flows are incorrectly nested inside gateway elements (e.g., f6/f7 under gw2 with wrong sources), making it non-parsable. Flows are duplicated, misconnected (e.g., f21 t2→t3, f4 t2→endEvent directly), and incomplete (gw2 lacks proper incoming/outgoing).
- **Missing core elements**: No "Auto-Classification" task (line 2); gw1 wrongly acts as classification without a preceding task.
- **Invented/extra elements violating "do not invent"**: Separate "Resolve Issue" tasks (t4 agent, t6, t7 "Specialist Resolves Issue"—not mentioned), serviceTask types, generic names, isExecutable="true", extra namespaces/attributes.
- **Wrong process flow**:
  - Password Reset path skips "Confirm with Customer" (direct to end).
  - Diagnosis → gw2 mishandled; no shared "Resolve Issue" after forward/specialist.
  - No merge of resolve paths (agent/specialist/password all lead to confirm).
  - Rework loop partially modeled (gw3→t3) but in broken context.
- **Fails constraints**: >40 lines if cleaned; extra explanatory text; no conditions; wrong task types (e.g., diagnosis as serviceTask).
- **No match to ground truth**: Ground truth has exact 3 gateways, 7 tasks, merged resolve (t4), password→confirm, specialist→resolve→confirm, conditions (yes/no), concise/valid XML under 40 lines.

Zero fidelity to description/ground truth; major hallucinations and structural errors warrant minimum score.
