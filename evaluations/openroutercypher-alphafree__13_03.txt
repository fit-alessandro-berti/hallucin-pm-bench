7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact count (1) for question 1, matching the ground truth precisely.

For question 2, it adequately notes the small sample size (3 cases, short timeframe) and risks of extrapolation leading to misestimation of frequency, which aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on sampling limitations. However, it deductibly omits key analytical depth: no mention of the drastic frequency swing (e.g., 0% to ~33% per case or 7% overall), wide confidence intervals, or sampling error for rare events. It also ignores the critical issue of near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and string-matching pitfalls, which the ground truth highlights as distortion sources. This reduces precision and completeness, warranting a ~25% deduction despite staying under word limit and avoiding speculation.
