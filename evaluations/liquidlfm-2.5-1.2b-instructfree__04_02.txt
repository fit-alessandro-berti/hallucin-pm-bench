**1.0**

The LLM answer fails completely: ignores required per-rule format (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable + ≤20-word justification for R1–R6), provides no analysis, wrongly concludes **COMPLIANT** (should be **NON-COMPLIANT** due to violations in R2, R3, R5), and offers only a vague, incorrect summary. Zero alignment with ground truth or prompt structure.
