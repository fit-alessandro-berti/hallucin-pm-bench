The LLM answer identifies the exact correct pairs (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Machines — Schedule_Machines) with perfect alphabetical ordering within pairs and across the list, matching the ground truth content and rationale precisely (only these two parallel pairs exist in Process B). No extraneous pairs or references to Process A.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Spacing does not exactly match the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (single space after Task_X before —, instead of two).
- Lacks precise alignment of em dashes across lines (ground truth pads second line with spaces after "Procure_Materials" to vertically align "—"; LLM does not).
- Minor potential trailing whitespace on first line.

These are small formatting differences but warrant a 1.0-point deduction per the strict evaluation criteria.
