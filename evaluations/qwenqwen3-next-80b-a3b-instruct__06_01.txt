9.0

- The LLM answer is accurate in identifying the correct pairs of parallel-executable tasks and uses the requested output format.
- The only notable (though minor) problem is the order of tasks within each pair: the ground truth and explicit instructions require alphabetical ordering *within* each pair (e.g., "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" instead of "Quality_Check  —  Create_Documentation"). The LLM reversed the pair for the second line, resulting in a deviation from strict alphabetical order within the pair.
- This reading error, while seemingly minor, directly contradicts a detailed formatting instruction, and in strict grading must result in a significant point deduction. Therefore, a score of 9.0 is given.
