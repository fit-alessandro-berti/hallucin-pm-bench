6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1 occurrence). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Perfect match (5.56%, with correct calculation). No deduction.
- **Question 3**: Near-perfect match (correctly identifies A1002 as the sole case). Minor phrasing difference ("the case identifier" vs. "only case"), but negligible. No deduction.
- **Question 4**: Significant deviations and errors, warranting heavy deduction (-3.5 points total from a potential 10). The LLM provides two reasons, but neither fully aligns with the ground truth's specified sampling-related biases (small sample size, temporal bias, case-mix bias, survivorship/truncation bias), and they lack the required clarity/detail. Specifically:
  - First reason hallucinates the time span as "one month" (falsely infers beyond the log, which covers only ~5 hours on one day, 2025-05-01), violating the system prompt against assuming/inferring unlisted events. This is a major factual error, not derivable from the data.
  - Second reason vaguely touches on non-representativeness and lack of pattern (loosely akin to small sample or temporal bias) but is imprecise, undetailed, and doesn't clearly state a ground-truth equivalent (e.g., no mention of variance, short window, high-risk segments, or omitted order types).
  
Overall, questions 1-3 are accurate and grounded in the log (high fidelity to ground truth), but question 4 introduces unjustified inference/hallucination, reducing the score despite partial relevance in the second reason. Strict evaluation penalizes the deviation heavily, as even small errors (e.g., vague phrasing) or larger ones (e.g., time hallucination) must reflect significant loss.
