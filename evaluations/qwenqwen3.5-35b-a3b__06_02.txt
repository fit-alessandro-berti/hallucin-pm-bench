The LLM answer is identical to the ground truth answer in content, structure, task names, order, numbering, and comma separation. Minor rendering differences in trailing whitespace (likely artifacts) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they do not alter meaning, formatting requirements, or compliance with the prompt. Perfect match.
