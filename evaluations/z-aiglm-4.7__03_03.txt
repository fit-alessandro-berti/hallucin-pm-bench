**7.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
The LLM answer produces a valid, self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML that semantically models the process correctly per the prompt, including all required gateways, two end events, wrc_ ID prefixes, loop for incompleteness, parallel paths, and verbatim-matching task names for most elements (e.g., "Validate the claim", "Request missing information", "Send rejection notice", "Update inventory records", "Close the claim"; parallel task names match bolded prompt text). Flow logic matches the description, with proper parallel split/join and rejection end.

However, under utmost strictness vs. ground truth and rubric:
- **Extra/hallucinated task (-2.0)**: Includes `wrc_CheckEligibility` ("Check warranty eligibility") task between completeness gateway "Yes" and warranty gateway. Ground truth omits this (direct connection via `wrc_sf5`), treating the warranty gateway as representing the "checks warranty eligibility" decision (per "exclusive gateway for step 3 warranty decision"). This adds an unminimal sequential task + associated flows (`wrc_flow_complete`, `wrc_flow_4`), violating "model **only** explicitly mentioned" and "minimal-yet-complete" expectation. Semantically minor but structural difference/excess.
- **Extra DI section (-1.0)**: Full `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` with shapes/edges (~200+ lines) for layout/rendering. Ground truth has none (pure model, 34 lines), making LLM non-minimal/bloated despite "XML diagram" phrasing allowing it.
- Minor diffs (no further deduct, per rubric): Different IDs/flow names/gateway labels (allowed for equivalence), namespaces (`bpmn2` vs `bpmn`), inline refs + separate flows (valid redundancy), process name (extra but harmless).

Equivalent structure/ID variations would be 10.0; extras prevent perfection.
