8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added: `check_vip`, `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive) and uses the exact required headings with bullet points as specified in the prompt. However, under utmost strictness:
- Lists only task IDs instead of full names with IDs as in ground truth (significant omission of name details present in XML).
- Simpler list formatting (plain newlines vs. bulleted `*` items).
- Gateway phrasing is concise but lacks explicit "changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)" structure, version labels, and markdown emphasis.
- No final note "(No other differences should be reported.)".

These presentation and detail differences result in notable divergence from ground truth, deducting 2 points from a perfect score. No incorrect facts or extras.
