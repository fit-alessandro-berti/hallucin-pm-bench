7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Compliance Conclusion**: Correctly identifies "Non-compliant" in the final revised answer, aligning with the ground truth. (+2 points)
- **Rule 1 Assessment**: Accurate (satisfied, with correct citation of events 2/3 before 5). (+1.5 points)
- **Rule 2 Assessment**: Initially erroneous (misordered events 8/9), but self-corrects to identify the violation accurately (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods). This shows reasoning but introduces unnecessary confusion. (+1 point, deducted 0.5 for initial error)
- **Rule 3 Assessment**: Major errorâ€”incorrectly states "satisfied" and "timely," missing the violation (Three_way_match at event 10, distance=3 >2 from event 6). This is a significant factual oversight, as ground truth explicitly flags it. (-3 points)
- **Rule 4 Assessment**: Accurate (Intern at 7 does not directly follow CFO at 3). (+1 point)
- **Rule 5 Assessment**: Accurate (ends with Archive_Record at 11, nothing after). (+1 point)
- **Structure and Format**: Ground truth is clean, numbered 1-5 with overall summary. LLM's response is messy (starts with "Compliant," includes self-contradiction, correction, and apology), deviating from the prompt's expected "Compliant/Non-compliant" followed by numbered justification. This reduces clarity and professionalism. (-1 point)
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., initial Rule 2 flip-flop) incur significant loss; the Rule 3 miss is not small, as it omits a key violation, making the justification incomplete (only 1/2 violations noted). Total base: 10 - deductions = 7.5. No credit for partial correctness on missed elements.
