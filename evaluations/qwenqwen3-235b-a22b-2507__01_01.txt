### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies and summarizes all three core decision points from the process description, aligning closely with the ground truth in content (eligibility check, amount threshold, and approval/rejection logic). It correctly excludes the legacy activity and lists all seven required documents without introducing new ones. However, under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Minor deductions (-1.0 total)**:
  - Introduces interpretive details not explicitly in the process description, such as specific examples in decision bases (e.g., "cancellation, significant delay" or "qualifying circumstances" for triage; "compliance with internal...policies" for pre-approval) and elaborated purposes/usage for documents. These are reasonable inferences but violate the "do not introduce" instruction by adding undefined elements.
  - Slight phrasing variances: E.g., threshold check as "during or after" EligibilityChecklist (ground truth specifies "after" Finance_Controller_PreApprove); structures pre-approval as a standalone decision rather than combining it with auditor review as "final payment approval."
  - Structural differences: Uses descriptive lists with sub-bullets instead of a table for decisions, and adds extra sections/notes (e.g., exclusion note placement, final confirmation). While functional, this deviates from ground truth's concise tabular/list format.

No major errors (e.g., missing points, invented activities/documents, or factual inaccuracies), so the score remains high but not perfect due to the emphasis on strictness for even small additions or rephrasings.
