The LLM answer correctly identifies non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses each rule with no factual errors, matching the ground truth's conclusions. However, it loses points for minor differences: less detailed reasoning (e.g., Rule 3 omits emphasis on "both QE and RA"; Rule 2 skips explicit mention of severity="High"); bullet-point format vs. ground truth's table; and absence of an explicit overall non-compliance statement. These small gaps in completeness and structure warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
