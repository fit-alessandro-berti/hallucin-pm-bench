**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (Perfect match, +5/5):** LLM correctly identifies "1" occurrence with precise evidence (CaseID/timestamp), aligning exactly with ground truth despite added detail.
- **Q2 (Partial match, +1/5):** Captures core idea of tiny/unrepresentative sample (3 cases/1 day) causing unreliability (~+0.8). Mentions small size/non-generalizable ratio (~+0.2).  
  **Major deductions (-4 total):**  
  - Misses precise quantification (14 events, <2 hours, 0-7% swing, wide CI, rare-event sampling error; -1.2).  
  - Ignores key data-driven point: near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) risking confusion via strict/fuzzy matching (-1.5).  
  - Adds forbidden speculation (hundreds/thousands cases, risk rules, low-volume day, 1-in-3 as potential true ratio; -1.3).  
  Word count compliant (108 vs. ≤120).  

Overall: Strong on Q1/main thesis, but strict criteria penalize omissions of ground-truth uniques and speculation heavily.
