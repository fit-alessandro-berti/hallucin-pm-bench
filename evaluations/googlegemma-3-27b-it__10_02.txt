6.0

The LLM answer makes an effort to use the enforced vocabulary and produces a RACI table, but several issues and deviations from the ground truth and requirements are present:

**Major issues leading to points deduction:**

- The **Operations Manager** role is entirely missing from the LLM answer's table, while it appears throughout the ground truth as "Accountable." This is a significant omission and impacts process clarity and compliance.
- The breakdown of tasks is inconsistent: the LLM's answer splits "KYC Review" into "KYC Review - Sender" and "KYC Review - Beneficiary," while the ground truth keeps this as one line for simplicity and adherence to the task list (albeit either is defensible, but consistency matters).
- The LLM designates "Transaction Analyst" as Accountable (A) for several steps, whereas in the ground truth, the "Operations Manager" is always Accountable. Misattributing R/A roles is a notable process design flaw.
- "Consulted" and "Informed" participants are often omitted or inconsistently assigned (e.g., for "Release Payment," IT Support should be Consulted as in the ground truth). In SWIFT transmission, no A/I/C is given according to the required structure.
- The LLM answer uses "SWIFT Message Transmission," which, while a reasonable label, is not explicitly mandated in the source text nor in the ground truth, making step alignment unclear. Similarly, "Log Transfer Instruction" versus "Receive Payment Instruction" is a slight divergence—minor, but in aggregate, these want precision.

**Minor but significant discrepancies:**

- "Archive Record" is phrased as "Case File Archival" in the LLM answer—not exactly matching, but close. The Accountable/Responsible allocations differ from the ground truth.
- "Sanctions Screening" lists "Regulatory Liaison" as Consulted, rather than Accountable per the ground truth.

**Positives:**

- The LLM follows the mandated vocabulary for roles and avoids prohibited synonyms.
- The overall structure (table in Markdown, headings, etc.) matches the requested format.
- Most major activities are present, although not precisely aligned.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer covers the major steps, uses correct mandated role names, and provides a RACI structure, but significant process-role allocation errors, missing roles, and inconsistencies in mapping tasks penalize the score sharply. Therefore, 6.0 reflects substantial adherence to basic requirements but with notable failings in strictness demanded.
