5.0

**Assessment**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer consistently uses the mandated vocabulary (“KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”).
- All steps from the informal process are represented.
- Format and RACI matrix style is largely clear and in Markdown.

**Significant Issues:**
- **Missing Role:** The LLM omits “Operations Manager,” which is present and Accountable (A) for all activities in the ground truth. This is a crucial omission (RACI matrices must account for accountability, which cannot default to the same party listed as Responsible).
- **Mapping Inaccuracies:**
  - In step 1 (“Receive & log transfer instruction”), "Regulatory Liaison" is Accountable, but the ground truth has “Operations Manager” as Accountable and “Regulatory Liaison” only Informed.
  - In steps 2, 3, and 4, the LLM assigns "RA" (both Responsible and Accountable) to "Regulatory Liaison", where ground truth distinctly separates Responsible (“Transaction Analyst” or “Regulatory Liaison”) and Accountable (“Operations Manager”).
  - The LLM sometimes merges Responsible and Accountable without strong justification.
  - The "Consulted" (C) and "Informed" (I) designations are underused or misapplied versus the detailed ground truth.
  - IT Support’s roles sometimes differ from ground truth (especially "Archive case file" where in ground truth the Regulatory Liaison is Informed, not notified).
- **Task Naming:** The LLM answer sometimes paraphrases activities (e.g., “Receive & log transfer instruction” instead of “Receive Payment Instruction”), though this is a minor issue compared to the role mapping.

**Summary:**  
The answer covers the mandated vocabulary and process steps but omits a required role ('Operations Manager'), mishandles Accountable assignments, and is less granular in role responsibilities (especially for C and I). These are significant mistakes in a RACI table, justifying a *major* deduction.

**Therefore, strict evaluation yields a 5.0.**
