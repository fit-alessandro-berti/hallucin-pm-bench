2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit):** The LLM answer correctly enforces the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") throughout, avoiding prohibited alternatives. However, it omits the "Operations Manager" role present in the ground truth, which is a significant structural deviation despite not being explicitly mandated in the prompt. This results in incomplete role coverage (-1.5 points).
  
- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Major Errors):** The LLM splits tasks (e.g., 5a/5b for release/SWIFT, explicit "notify" in task 6) and uses non-exact phrasing (e.g., "Receive & log transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; adds "post-approval" and "sender & beneficiary" details not preserved in ground truth). It covers all informal description steps but introduces unsubtle additions/granularity not matching the ground truth's consolidated, precise mapping (e.g., no separate SWIFT task; "Archive Record" lacks notification). This constitutes omissions in fidelity and unauthorized expansions (-3.0 points).

- **RACI Assignments (Critical Mismatches):** Assignments differ substantially across nearly every task, with no alignment on multi-role involvements (e.g., task 1: LLM assigns A to Regulatory Liaison, but ground truth assigns A to Operations Manager and I to Liaison; task 3: LLM's RA for Liaison vs. ground truth's R for Liaison, C for Analyst, A for Operations Manager). The use of "RA" (combined) is non-standard compared to ground truth's separate R/A/C/I, violating clear delineation. These are fundamental errors in responsibility mapping (-3.0 points).

- **Table Structure and Clarity (Minor but Penalized):** Markdown table is used, with bolding for readability, but lacks the ground truth's exact header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), legend format, and post-table explanatory bullets confirming compliance. The added title and workflow description at the end are extraneous, not present in ground truth (-0.5 points).

- **Overall Strictness:** With utmost strictness, the response shows a superficial grasp of the prompt but fails in core accuracy to the ground truth, reflecting a different process interpretation. Only basic vocabulary adherence prevents a 1.0 score. Total deductions lead to a low rating.
