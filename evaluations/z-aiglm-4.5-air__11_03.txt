4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies excesses (+300s for the first two, +60s for Credit Assessment), grounding these in the table data without invention. Waiting times are also correctly stated. Structure is memo-like with a header, TO/FROM/SUBJECT, analysis section, and bulleted recommendations, adhering to "bullet points only for recommendations" (though a bold header precedes them, a minor deviation). Word count is approximately 140, close to ~150.

However, significant deductions apply strictly for the following differences from ground truth:
- **Phrasing and Analysis Section (major loss: -2.0 points)**: Lacks ground truth's introductory context (e.g., total cases analysis, "materially breach service targets while accumulating the largest queues"), uses different bolding/formatting (e.g., activity names vs. throughput/SLA values), and alters wording (e.g., "severe SLA breaches and elevated waiting times" vs. precise GT phrasing). No closing projection on cycle time/SLA restoration, omitting GT's forward-looking summary.
- **Recommendations (major loss: -2.5 points)**: Completely divergent content—LLM provides vague, non-concrete actions (e.g., "Analyze queue bottlenecks," "Allocate additional resources," "Investigate handoff inefficiencies") that are not data-driven (no ties to specific metrics like cases, times, or throughput splits) and overly focus on waiting time alone. GT offers precise, actionable steps (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic") with process-specific details, even if some (like €25k) stretch data grounding. Bullets include activity labels ("For Risk Review:"), unlike GT's integrated "for **Activity**" format.
- **Header and Metadata (minor loss: -1.0 point)**: FROM line mismatches (Senior Process-Performance Analyst vs. Process Performance Office); SUBJECT differs (generic vs. "Throughput Bottlenecks in Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)"); no italics or date/specification.
- Small errors compound: No total cases mention (GT has 4,805, derived from data sum ~5,885 but close enough as intent); recommendations not "projected" impactful like GT.

Overall, core identification/quantification matches (~60% alignment), but phrasing, recommendations, and structure deviate substantially, warranting a mid-low score under strict criteria.
