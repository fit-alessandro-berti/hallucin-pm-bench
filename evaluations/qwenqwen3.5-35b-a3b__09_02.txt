The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt by citing the explicit lack of timestamps from the provided artifacts, correctly concluding it cannot be determined. Minor deductions for: (1) slightly less precise phrasing ("cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute") and not explicitly naming “Dual Authorization” (though contextually clear); (2) not elaborating on "event counts" or "start-to-completion intervals" as causal links, making it marginally less explanatory than the ground truth despite equal validity. No factual errors.
