### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the strict vocabulary policy by using only "Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," and "Risk Scoring" without any synonyms or leaks from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment," "CDD," or "Sanctions Check"). This is a strong point, earning baseline credit. The output is formatted as a Markdown table, and it attempts to cover roles and activities without merging them.

However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions are applied for the following errors and differences from the ground truth (each treated as a major deviation, with small mismatches compounding to reflect ~80% inaccuracy):

- **Added and renamed activities (major violation of "do not rename, merge, or add activities")**: The LLM adds "Notification" (not in ground truth and arguably a minor non-core activity) and renames "Release Funds" to "Payment Release" (a synonym variation, introducing inconsistency). Ground truth has exactly 6 activities; LLM has 7, altering the scope.
  
- **RACI assignments differ in nearly every cell (high inaccuracy)**: 
  - Uses "I" (Informed) universally instead of "–" (no involvement), which is incorrect for RACI methodology and mismatches ground truth (e.g., Front-Office Analyst is "–" for KYC Review and AML Screening in ground truth but "I" in LLM).
  - Core mismatches include: For Risk Scoring, Compliance is "R/A" (LLM) vs. "R" (ground), Officer is "C" vs. "A," Front-Office is "I" vs. "C." For Compliance Officer Approval, Compliance is "I" vs. "C," Treasury Ops is "I" vs. "–." For Release Funds/Payment Release, Compliance and Officer are "I" vs. "C."
  - Only partial matches (e.g., Front-Office "R/A" for Intake Vetting, Treasury "R/A" for release) prevent a total zero.

- **Extraneous elements**: Adds a title ("# NimbusPay Wire-Transfer RACI Matrix") and "Legend" section, not requested (prompt specifies only the Markdown table). Ground truth is pure table + judge notes (irrelevant here).

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses "R/A" without bolding or commas ("**R, A**" in ground truth), and the table header lacks the exact spacing/alignment of ground truth.

These deviations show poor fidelity to the process narrative's implied responsibilities (e.g., no clear escalation logic in RACI, overusing "I"). Cumulative differences exceed 70% from ground truth, justifying a low score despite vocabulary compliance.
