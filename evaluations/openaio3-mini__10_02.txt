3.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
This score reflects a strict comparison to the ground truth, penalizing all deviations heavily, including role omissions, assignment mismatches, task phrasing differences, and structural variances. Even partial alignments (e.g., correct use of mandated terms like "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst") do not offset major errors, as per the instructions. The LLM answer covers the source text's steps but introduces significant inaccuracies and incompletenesses relative to the ground truth.

#### Key Differences and Point Deductions:
1. **Roles (Major Deviation, -3.0 points)**:
   - Ground truth includes four roles: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support.
   - LLM omits Operations Manager and IT Support entirely, using only two roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison). This fails to "cover every task" from the source (e.g., IT Support's explicit roles in steps 5 and 6). Assigning IT Support tasks to Transaction Analyst is a substitution error, violating the mandate to use terms "only" as specified without unauthorized changes.

2. **RACI Assignments (Major Deviation, -2.5 points)**:
   - Nearly every task has mismatched assignments:
     - Task 1 (Receive): Ground truth has TA **R**, OpsM **A**, IT C, RL I; LLM has TA **R/A** (wrong A; misses C/I).
     - Task 2 (Screen): Ground truth TA **R**, RL **A**, Ops I, IT C; LLM TA **R/A** (wrong A; misses I/C).
     - Task 3 (KYC Review): Ground truth TA C, RL **R**, Ops **A**, IT I; LLM RL **R/A**, TA C/I (partial R/C match, but wrong A/I; redundant TA for C/I).
     - Task 4 (Approve): Ground truth TA C, RL **R**, Ops **A**, IT I; LLM same as Task 3 (partial R/C, but wrong A/I).
     - Task 5 (Release/SWIFT): Ground truth TA **R**, RL I, Ops **A**, IT C (for Release only); LLM TA **R/A**, RL C/I (partial R/I, but wrong A/C; incorrectly combines SWIFT under TA without IT involvement).
     - Task 6 (Archive/Notify): Ground truth TA C, RL I, Ops **A**, IT **R**; LLM TA **R/A**, RL I (wrong R/A; misses C).
   - Consistent error: LLM over-assigns Accountable to the Responsible role (e.g., TA or RL as both), diluting accountability. No exact row matches; only ~40% partial overlap (e.g., some **R** correct).

3. **Task Phrasings and Coverage (Moderate Deviation, -1.0 points)**:
   - Ground truth uses concise, mandated phrasings (e.g., "**KYC Review**" bolded; "Archive Record" omits notify).
   - LLM uses longer, interpretive phrasings (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on the sender and beneficiary" adds source details not in ground truth; "Release the payment and ensure the SWIFT message is sent" combines steps and includes unseparated SWIFT action, which ground truth omits entirely). This inflates tasks and deviates from ground truth's brevity. Notify in step 6 is embedded in LLM's task name but not in ground truth's.

4. **Table Structure and Format (Minor Deviation, -0.5 points)**:
   - Ground truth: Tasks as rows, role columns with letters (**R/A** bolded), separate legend, and explanatory note on mandates.
   - LLM: Standard RACI columns (Responsible, etc.) with role names filled (â€“ for empties), no bolding, intro/closing text instead of legend. While Markdown-compliant, it doesn't match ground truth's transposed format or bolding for emphasis. Redundant C/I assignments to the same role in some rows add unnecessary complexity.

5. **Adherence to Mandated Vocabulary (Strength, +1.5 points baseline)**:
   - LLM correctly uses "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst" exclusively where applicable (e.g., no "payment clerk" or "compliance officer"). However, this is baseline compliance; failure to integrate IT Support as-is (unmandated but source-required) undercuts it.

#### Overall:
- **Strengths (limited)**: Uses mandated terms accurately; covers all source steps without omission; produces a clear Markdown RACI table.
- **Weaknesses (dominant)**: Omits key roles, mismatches ~80% of assignments, alters task coverage/phrasing, and deviates from ground truth's structure/legend. This results in a table that does not align closely with the provided ground truth, warranting a low score despite effort. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, core mismatches prevent higher than 3.5.
