4.0

**Justification:**

*Positives:*
- The LLM answer strictly used the mandated vocabulary for the roles ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") and the task ("KYC Review"), not introducing forbidden synonyms.
- Each process step from the source text is mapped to a RACI table row.
- The answer is formatted clearly in Markdown.

*Critical Errors:*
1. **Missing Role ("Operations Manager")**:  
   The Ground Truth Answer lists "Operations Manager" and "IT Support" (as per the source text), but the LLM answer omits "Operations Manager" entirely, which is a significant process error. "Operations Manager" is also omitted from the RACI table columns.

2. **Incorrect RACI Allocations (Accountable role)**:  
   - The LLM answer marks "Transaction Analyst" or "Regulatory Liaison" as Accountable for tasks where the Ground Truth clearly assigns accountability to "Operations Manager" for process control.
   - "IT Support" is omitted from all accountability and responsibility assignments, though it is explicitly responsible for archiving the case file in the process (step 6).

3. **Task Labeling Issues:**  
   - The LLM answer paraphrases several tasks (e.g., "Archive the case file and notify the Regulatory Liaison") instead of aligning directly with the mandated wording ("Archive Record").
   - Some task labels are verbose and do not use the process-neutral wording from the ground truth answer.

4. **Responsibility Attribution**:  
   - For KYC Review, the LLM assigns both Responsible and Accountable to "Regulatory Liaison", while the guide gives "Responsible" to "Regulatory Liaison" and "Accountable" to "Operations Manager".
   - For archiving, "Transaction Analyst" is marked as both Responsible and Accountable, but source text and ground truth assign Responsibility to "IT Support".

5. **Consulted/Informed Omissions:**  
   - Many consult/inform relationships from the GT answer are missing or incomplete.

6. **Failing to match column structure:**  
   - The LLM RACI matrix does not include all mandated actor columns.

*Conclusion:*
With strict marking, these errors are severe (omitting a whole role, misattributing accountability, and not reflecting the actual process division of labor). The maximum possible score under these criteria cannot exceed 4.0.
