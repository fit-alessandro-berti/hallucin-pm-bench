5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates a reasonable attempt but contains *significant* deviations from the ground truth, both structurally and in terms of role attribution and RACI mappings. Key issues:

1. **Missing Role (“Operations Manager”)**: The LLM omits the ‘Operations Manager’ entirely, which is present and marked as Accountable (**A**) for every activity in the ground truth. This is a major structural omission.

2. **RACI Misassignments**:
   - The Accountable and Responsible assignments do not always separate these roles (e.g., “Transaction Analyst” marked both Responsible and Accountable for some tasks, where the ground truth keeps these separate).
   - The Consulted and Informed columns are almost always empty or underpopulated, while the ground truth consistently populates these with at least some participants.

3. **Vocabulary Adherence is Decent**: The LLM does correctly use only “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, and “Transaction Analyst” as instructed.

4. **Task Naming**: The task names are mostly aligned, though phrasing sometimes varies slightly (“Receive and log transfer instruction” versus “Receive Payment Instruction”, “Archive case file and notify Regulatory Liaison” vs. “Archive Record”), but this is minor.

5. **Activities/Steps**: The LLM splits “archive and notify” into one task, while the ground truth has “Archive Record” as a step, but the LLM at least captures the notification.

6. **RACI Format**: The LLM’s columns do not strictly adhere to the ground truth’s format and level of granularity.

**In summary:**  
The answer meets the vocabulary mandate but suffers from an incomplete mapping of roles and serious omissions (especially the lack of the Accountable party/Operations Manager). The logic of the RACI assignments is not as precise as the exemplar.  
**Thus, a strict (but fair) 5.0 is warranted.**
