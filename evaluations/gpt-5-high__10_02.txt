The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Table Structure and Format**: The LLM uses a task-row format with R/A/C/I columns populated by named roles (e.g., "Transaction Analyst" in cells), while the ground truth uses role-based columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) with R/A/C/I symbols in cells. This is a fundamental mismatch in RACI presentation. The LLM lacks the ground truth's "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header, bolding (e.g., on "**KYC Review**"), and legend.

- **Roles**: The LLM correctly limits to mandated roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison) plus source-term IT Support, but omits the ground truth's "Operations Manager" entirely, which appears in nearly every row of the ground truth as Accountable (A) or other. This creates non-matching assignments across all tasks.

- **Tasks and Coverage**: The LLM has 7 tasks, over-splitting the source (e.g., separate "Release payment (post-approval)" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent"; combined "Archive case file and notify Regulatory Liaison"). The ground truth has exactly 6 tasks, with different phrasings (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. LLM's "Receive and log transfer instruction"; "Archive Record" vs. LLM's combined archive+notify; no explicit SWIFT task). Small wording variances (e.g., "Approve high-risk transaction" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions"; "KYC Review (sender and beneficiary)" vs. "**KYC Review**") are not identical, and the LLM adds unmandated details like "(post-approval)" and "(sender and beneficiary)", violating strict mapping.

- **RACI Assignments**: Completely mismatched per task (e.g., for screening: LLM has Responsible=Transaction Analyst, Accountable=Regulatory Liaison; ground truth has R=Transaction Analyst, A=Regulatory Liaison but adds I=Operations Manager, C=IT Support). Similar discrepancies everywhere, with no alignment on multi-role involvement or the ground truth's emphasis on Operations Manager as A.

- **Vocabulary and Fidelity**: While both use mandated terms ("KYC Review", etc.), the LLM's task phrasings introduce non-source elements (e.g., "transfer instruction" not in ground truth), and it fails to "map every step... without omissions or substitutions" exactly as the ground truth does (per its note). No extra roles in LLM, but this highlights the ground truth's unique additions, amplifying the non-match.

These are not minor errors; the overall output does not replicate the ground truth's structure, content, or assignments, resulting in minimal alignment despite basic Markdown and vocabulary compliance.
