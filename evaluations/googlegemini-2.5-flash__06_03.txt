9.5

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth answer. It correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks in Process B, lists them in the right order, and names all relevant tasks. However, it omits the explicit reference to the parallel blocks (“first parallel block”, “second parallel block”) and does not specifically state that no other tasks can run in parallel. These are small omissions, but per the instruction for utmost strictness, even small errors or missing details must result in a points deduction. Therefore, the answer receives a 9.5.
