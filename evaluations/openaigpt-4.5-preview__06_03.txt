9.0

The LLM answer correctly identified both sets of concurrently executable tasks in Process B, listed them in the correct order, and did not mention Processes A or C. The format is slightly less specific than the ground truthâ€”the LLM answer omits the explicit reference to "first/second parallel block" and uses less formal set delineation (no numbering or emphasized set labels), and lacks the final clarifying sentence about exclusivity of parallelism. These are small departures, but, according to strict grading, they warrant a notable deduction. Thus, a score of 9.0 is appropriate.
