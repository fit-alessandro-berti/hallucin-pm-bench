The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the ground truth in content and order with no factual errors or extraneous information. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., comma separation vs. â€– symbol, lack of block labels and concluding sentence, added introductory line, no bolding/backticks) and slightly less structured presentation, per strict evaluation criteria.
