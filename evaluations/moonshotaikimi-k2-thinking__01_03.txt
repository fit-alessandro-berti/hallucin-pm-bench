### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Partial Credit: ~7/10):**  
The LLM correctly identifies the two decision points and provides concise one-sentence descriptions that capture the core rules. However, strict comparison reveals minor but notable deviations:  
- For the risk-based skip: The LLM's phrasing ("the Manual-Underwriting-Review step is skipped") omits the explicit "otherwise proceeds" clause from the ground truth, which clarifies the branch's dual outcome and makes the rule complete. This is a small incompleteness, deducting points under strictness.  
- For TriVote: The LLM uses "any two ... grant approval," which is semantically close but not identical to the ground truth's "at least two ... record 'Approve.'" The difference in wording (e.g., "grant" vs. "record 'Approve.'") and lack of "only when" precision slightly weakens the exactness.  
No hallucinations or extras, but phrasing must align closely for full marks.

**Part (b) - Documents List (Low Credit: ~2/10):**  
This section has a major error: the LLM omits the three Scorecard documents (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow), which are explicitly listed as inputs (and thus required documents) in Step 3, appearing before the Deck Memo. This results in an incomplete list (only 6 items vs. ground truth's 9), violating the "all documents" requirement and disrupting the first-appearance order (e.g., Deck Memo is incorrectly placed as #2 instead of #5).  
- The included items are mostly accurate in order and description (e.g., separating Signed Offer Sheet 77 from the unsigned version matches the ground truth).  
- No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions).  
However, under utmost strictness, omitting one-third of the required documents is a critical failure, warranting severe deduction—even small errors like order shifts would cost points, and this is far from small.

**Overall Score Calculation:** Weighted average (a: 40%, b: 60% due to b's emphasis on completeness), adjusted for strictness on exactness and totality. The response is structured well and avoids extras, but incompleteness in b) heavily penalizes it.
