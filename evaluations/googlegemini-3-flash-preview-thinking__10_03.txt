**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.5)**: Correctly uses **exactly** the 4 mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) with no leaks of forbidden synonyms. No violations here.
- **Activities (major violations, -3.0)**: Prompt forbids adding/renaming/merging activities. LLM adds 4 unauthorized extras ("Approval", "Schedule the payment", "Release the funds", "Notify the originating analyst") with mismatched names vs. GT ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). Splits/merges narrative steps incorrectly (e.g., separate "Schedule" vs. GT's consolidated "Release Funds"; adds "Notify" not in GT). Core 4 activities present but extras inflate to 8 vs. GT's 6.
- **RACI assignments (major violations, -2.5)**: ~80% mismatch per cell vs. GT. Core R/A often partially aligns (e.g., Front R/A on Intake Vetting; Comp R/A on KYC/AML) but ignores GT's C/I/- nuances (e.g., no Comp C/Treas I on Intake; no Officer A on Risk Scoring; blanks ≠ GT's filled C/I/-). Extras have fabricated assignments (e.g., no GT equivalent for "Schedule" or "Notify").
- **Format/Structure (minor violations, -1.0)**: Markdown table valid but sloppy (blanks ≠ GT's –, R/A ≠ **R, A** bolding/separation, no full-cell fills, unbolded activities except headers, misaligned widths). Misses GT's precise styling.
- **Coverage of narrative/roles (fail, -2.0)**: Does not fully "cover every activity and role described" (blanks omit C/I involvements; ignores escalations/consults like Officer A on Risk Scoring).

Total raw alignment ~30% (core terms/partial RACI); strict penalty for additions/incompletes drops to 3.0. No small-error leniency.
