4.0

**Evaluation Summary**:  
- **R1**: Status match, justification similar but omits amount threshold (-0.5).  
- **R2**: Status mismatch (Compliant vs Violated), justification incorrect (ignores change-triggered final approval and timing) - major error (-4.0).  
- **R3**: Status and justification match.  
- **R5**: Status match, justification partially matches (omits Pay_Invoice example) (-0.5).  
- **R4, R6**: Full match.  
- **Overall**: Match, but format lacks table and violation list (-1.0).  
Strict deduction for critical R2 misanalysis (linked to R5 dynamics) results in low score despite partial accuracy.
