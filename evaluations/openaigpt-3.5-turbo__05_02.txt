**1.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Diff format**: Invalid unified diff (missing `@@` hunk header, context lines, proper `-`/`+` syntax; just a single unchanged-looking line). Ground truth is precise single-hunk. **Major failure (-3.0 pts)**.
- **Change proposed**: Wrong task ("GrantAccess" vs. "Task_CollectEquipment"); lengthens dueDate (P1D → P2D, worsening total ~12D → ~13D timeline) instead of shortening the bottleneck (P5D → P2D). Violates SLA-improvement goal. **Fundamental error (-4.0 pts)**.
- **Rationale**: Illogical ("2 days instead of 1 day... improve SLA compliance" – increasing time harms compliance); ignores 3-day SLA context. Ground truth is accurate/one-sentence. **Major failure (-2.0 pts)**.
- **Compliance with rules**: Modifies existing attribute (ok), but ineffective/wrong for SLA fix. **Partial (-0.0 further deduction)**.
Total: Strict deduction yields minimum score; no redeeming accuracy.
