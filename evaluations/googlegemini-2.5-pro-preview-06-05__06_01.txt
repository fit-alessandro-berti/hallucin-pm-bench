7.5

The LLM answer lists the correct two pairs and in the correct order, but it fails to exactly match the formatting required by the prompt and shown in the ground truth:

- The ground truth uses two spaces, an em dash (â€”), then two spaces between the task names.
- The LLM answer uses only one space, a hyphen, and one space.

This formatting error, though small, is significant per the grading criteria ("Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points.") and demonstrates a lack of strict adherence to the specified output format.

No other substantive errors were present: the content and sorting are both correct, and the answer ignores Process A as instructed.

Therefore, a score of 7.5 is assigned due to formatting inaccuracy.
