**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in answer ("No"), coverage of all relevant cases (C001–C004), sequences cited, verdicts per case (✅ for C001/C003, ❌ for C002/C004 with correct intervening activities "Pack_Items" and "Check_Fraud"), and conclusion (violations in C002/C004 falsify "always"). Differences are purely stylistic (list vs. table, use of backticks/bold/emojis vs. table bold/italics/escapes), with no errors, omissions, or deviations in content, citations, or logic. Under strict evaluation, this merits full marks.
