5.5

**Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

- The LLM answer strictly uses the mandated vocabulary: "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "KYC Review". No forbidden terms are present.
- The table is clearly organized and in Markdown format.
- The overall flow of tasks aligns with the process description.

**Major Issues:**

1. **Omission of the Operations Manager Role**:  
   - The Ground Truth includes an "Operations Manager" as a distinct role (who is Accountable for every major step), but the LLM answer omits this role entirely. This is a significant gap, as it leaves "Accountable" tasks unassigned to the correct designated function.

2. **Inconsistent 'Accountable' Assignment**:  
   - The RACI convention dictates a single "Accountable" per task. The LLM answer sometimes lists multiple "A"s (e.g., "A, R"), which is a technical error.
   - The LLM generally assigns "A" to "Regulatory Liaison" on almost every task, which is inconsistent with the Ground Truth.

3. **Process Step Mapping Differences**:  
   - The LLM answer splits some tasks (e.g., "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record") and adds new ("Ensure SWIFT Message is Sent", which is not in the RACI ground truth but inferred as part of payment release), and merges others.  
   - "Consulted" and "Informed" are assigned differently for most steps than in the ground truth. In particular, the LLM rarely uses "C".

4. **Incorrect KYC Review Handling**:  
   - "KYC Review" is mapped with "I" for Transaction Analyst and "A, R" for Regulatory Liaison, but in the ground truth the Regulatory Liaison is "R" and Operations Manager is "A". The differences are systematic throughout.

5. **Lack of Strict Mapping of Tasks/Terminology**:  
   - The LLM answer sometimes rewords steps (e.g. "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction"), which diverges from the mandated "Receive Payment Instruction".
   - The task names do not always mirror the wording and granularity of the ground truth.

**Minor Issues:**

- Slightly inconsistent capitalization in task titles.
- The explanation of the RACI key is fine (may be omitted), but the main problem is mapping and accountability.

**Conclusion:**

- There is strict vocabulary adherence and the general process is captured, but the LLM answer fails to replicate the correct role structure (Operations Manager), misses with RACI assignments (especially "Accountable"), and diverges in some task wording/detail.
- Due to these non-trivial mismatches—especially the missing Operations Manager and poor A/R mapping—significant points are deducted, but vocabulary discipline and process coverage prevent a lower score.

**Thus, 5.5 is assigned.**
