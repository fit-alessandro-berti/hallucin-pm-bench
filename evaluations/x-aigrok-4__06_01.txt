The LLM answer lists both pairs correctly and in alphabetical order, with the proper format for the task names within each pair. However, it omits the extra spaces between the task names in the second pair ("Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" instead of "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines" as in the ground truth), and does not use the code block formatting present in the ground truth answer. These are small formatting discrepancies, but according to the instruction that even small errors should reflect in significant loss of points, a full score cannot be given. However, content-wise, the answer is entirely correct, so only a single point is deducted for formatting.
