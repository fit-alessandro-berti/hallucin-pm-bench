The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B, lists them in alphabetical order within pairs and overall (Create_Documentation before Procure_Materials), and uses the specified format with one pair per line. Content matches the ground truth exactly. Minor deduction for inconsistent spacing in the second line ("Procure_Materials  —" with apparently only two spaces before "—", versus the ground truth's apparent alignment with additional spaces), which deviates slightly from potential implicit formatting expectations under strict evaluation.
