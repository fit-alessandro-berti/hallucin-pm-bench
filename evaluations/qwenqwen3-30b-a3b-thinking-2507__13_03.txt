### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Perfect matchâ€”correct count of 1, with accurate reference to the specific instance (Case 1002). No deductions (10/10).
- **Question 2**: Strong on sample size limitations (3 cases, one day) and potential for volume bias in full log, correctly noting string variations (e.g., automatic checks). Adheres to word limit. However, significant omissions under strict criteria: ignores statistical details like event count (14), time span (<2 hours), sampling error (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to ~7%, wide confidence intervals), and nuanced risks of strict/fuzzy string matching distorting estimates. Explanation shifts focus to temporal coverage over sampling unreliability, reducing fidelity (5/10).
- **Overall**: Q1 excellence offsets Q2 gaps, but strictness demands deduction for incomplete conceptual depth in the explanatory core.
