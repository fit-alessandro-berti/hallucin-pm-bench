**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (strong match, +2.0 base)**: Uses **Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring** exactly as mandated. No leaks of disallowed terms (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", "Sanctions Check", "risk rating"). Matches ground truth here perfectly.
- **Structure and format (good, +1.0)**: Valid Markdown table with all 4 roles as columns. Bold activity headers. Uses consistent dashes/hyphens for no involvement (minor diff from ground truth's em-dash "–", but functional).
- **Activities covered (partial, +0.5)**: Identifies 6 activities matching ground truth count and intent (no merge/add). Core 4 perfect. "Compliance Officer Approval" exact match. "Fund Release" vs. ground truth "Release Funds" is a rename → strict deduction (violates "do not rename").
- **RACI assignments (major failures, -3.0+ deductions)**:
  | Activity                      | Exact Cell Matches | Partial Matches | Key Errors (Strict) |
  |-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
  | **Intake Vetting**            | 1/4 (Officer –)   | Front (R vs. **R,A**) | Misses Front A, Comp C, Treas I |
  | **KYC Review**                | 1/4 (Front –)     | Comp (R vs. **R,A**) | Officer A vs. C; misses Treas I |
  | **AML Screening**             | 1/4 (Front –)     | Comp (R vs. **R,A**) | Officer A vs. C; misses Treas I (identical to KYC errors) |
  | **Risk Scoring**              | 2/4 (Comp R, Officer A) | None           | Misses Front C, Treas I |
  | **Compliance Officer Approval**| 2/4 (Officer **R/A**, Treas –) | None      | Misses Front I, Comp C |
  | **Release Funds**             | 2/4 (Front I, Treas **R/A**) | None      | Misses Comp C, Officer C; rename |

  - **Total exact matches**: ~8/24 cells (33%). Partials ignored under strictness.
  - Zero "C" (Consulted) anywhere (ground truth has 8+). Few "I" (misses 5+).
  - Wrong "A" placements (e.g., Officer A for KYC/AML/Risk vs. C; merges R/A format vs. ground "**R, A**").
  - Fails "covering **every activity and role**" → many roles unassigned per narrative (e.g., no notifications implied, but ground infers I/C broadly).
- **Overall**: ~40% alignment despite vocab/structure strengths. Extensive RACI errors (core deliverable) warrant severe penalty. Small issues (rename, formatting) compound losses. No leniency.
