4.5

- The LLM answer **correctly uses all four mandated terms** ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") and **no forbidden synonyms appear**. This is positive.
- The matrix is returned as Markdown, as required.
- **Significant issues**:
    - The LLM invents or renames activities:
        - "High-Risk Case Approval" is not a permissible or source activity; it should be "Compliance Officer Approval".
        - "Schedule Payment" does not appear in the ground truth. Only "Release Funds" is listed.
        - "Notify Originating Analyst" is not a separately listed activity in the ground truth.
    - “Risk Scoring”:
        - LLM marks Compliance Analyst as R (correct), but Compliance Officer as A for this activity. This matches the ground truth (which is good).
    - “Intake Vetting”:
        - LLM gives I to Compliance Analyst (wrong, should be C), and omits Treasury Ops as I (should have I).
    - RACI assignments are frequently incorrect compared to ground truth. For example:
        - In "KYC Review", ground truth: Compliance Analyst is R, A; Compliance Officer is C, and Treasury Ops is I. LLM gives R to Compliance Analyst and A to Compliance Officer (incorrect).
        - "AML Screening": LLM assigns R to Compliance Analyst, A to Compliance Officer, but ground truth gives both R, A to Compliance Analyst and C to Compliance Officer.
        - For "Compliance Officer Approval" (misnamed as "High-Risk Case Approval"): LLM gives R, A to Compliance Officer, but gives C, I to Compliance Analyst and I to Treasury Ops. Ground truth is: Compliance Analyst as C, Compliance Officer as R, A, and Front-Office as I.
        - "Release Funds": LLM marks only Treasury Ops as R, A, misses that the others should be C/I per ground truth.
    - Consistently, I (Informed), C (Consulted), etc. are misapplied or omitted for several roles.

**Summary**:  
- Correct usage of vocabulary earns partial credit.
- **Major deduction** for inaccurate activity set (added or renamed activities) and RACI assignments frequently not matching ground truth.
- Partial credit for formatting and compliance with forbidden terms.
- Thus, a **strict score of 4.5** reflects significant compliance failure, despite adherence to the strict vocabulary.
