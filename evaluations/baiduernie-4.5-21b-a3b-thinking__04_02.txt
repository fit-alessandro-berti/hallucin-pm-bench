5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Format and Structure**: The LLM answer follows the required format reasonably well (status + short justification per rule, overall result in all-caps). Minor deviation: casual phrasing and no table, but prompt doesn't mandate a table. No major deduction here (-0.5 points).
- **R1**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, similar justification). Full credit.
- **R2**: Major error – incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated. Justification ignores the Change_Request's impact on requiring a new approval (final approval on 2025-03-07), leading to Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) not being within 2 days *after* the last required approval. This misinterprets rule interactions with R5. Significant deduction (-3.0 points).
- **R3**: Matches ground truth (Violated, accurate justification). Full credit.
- **R4**: Matches ground truth (Not Applicable, similar justification). Full credit.
- **R5**: Matches status (Violated), but justification is partially incomplete – mentions Ship_Goods/Receive_Goods but omits Pay_Invoice (a key "further processing step" before new approval), unlike ground truth. Minor inaccuracy, but reflects core violation. Partial credit (-0.5 points).
- **R6**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, similar justification). Full credit.
- **Overall**: Correctly NON-COMPLIANT, but lists only R3/R5 violations, omitting R2 (per ground truth: R2, R3, R5). Incomplete, leading to deduction (-1.0 points).
- **Justification Length**: All ≤20 words, compliant.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: As instructed, the critical R2 error (misunderstanding rule linkage and timeline) and incomplete overall result warrant substantial loss, despite 4/6 rules fully correct. Starting from 10.0, total deductions: -5.0.
