6.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring breakdown):
- **Identification of three worst activities (jointly on SLA breaches + high waiting)**: Correct (Legal Approval +300s/600s wait; Risk Review +300s/480s; Credit Assessment +60s/200s). Matches GT. (+2.0)
- **Quantification of SLA excess**: Exact matches for breaches and wait times; includes cases (bonus, GT omits). (+2.0)
- **Structure as executive memo**: Appropriate To/From/Subject; ~140 words; bullets **only** for recs; only memo text. Minor diffs (e.g., From line, Subject generic, no bold/total cases). (-0.5)
- **Grounding in data/no invention**: Fails critically—false claim "All other activities... remain within parameters" (ignores Verify Identity breach: 120s>90s). Intro vague/uninspired vs. GT's precise. (-2.0)
- **Recommendations**: Bullets used correctly, one per activity. But **not concrete/data-driven** (vague: "lower waiting," "shorten throughput," "reduce waiting"; first nonsensical—waiting *is* 600s). GT's are specific/actionsable (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks"). Major failure on "concrete, data-driven." (-1.5)

**Total: 6.0**. Strong core analysis but undermined by data misrepresentation, weak recs, and polish gaps. Strict deduction for all errors.
