7.0

The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains a key inaccuracy and a minor but important deviation in phrasing and interpretation:

- **Added tasks:** 
    - Correctly identifies "Verify Identity", "Request Additional Documents", and "Final Reject".  
    - Incorrectly adds "Auto-Approve Loan" as an added task, based on the argument that it's a structural change even though this was functionally just a renaming of "Approve Loan". The instructions clearly said to ignore cosmetic renamings; even though the outgoing flows differ, the task name and id suggest it is not a new (added) task, but a renamed one. This is an error per the strict instructions and leads to a significant deduction.
- **Removed tasks:**
    - Correctly identifies "Reject Loan".
- **Gateway-type changes:**
    - Correctly identifies the switch from exclusive to inclusive.
- **Other minor issues:** 
    - The answer adds an explanatory note about "Auto-Approve Loan" but this is neither needed nor requested, and could confuse or mislead against the strict rubric established.

Overall, the structure, grouping, and identification are correct except for one incorrectly listed added task and a bit of unnecessary commentary. As requested, small but impactful errors (especially categorization of an unchanged task as "added") must result in significant point loss: 7.0 reflects this.
