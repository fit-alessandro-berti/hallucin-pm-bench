7.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment, and quantifies by how much each exceeds its SLA.
- It reports both throughput and waiting time accurately, with minor rounding/wording differences from the ground truth (e.g., expressing percent “over target” and percent of waiting as “of total”).
- It does not mention any activities or metrics not present in the table, as required.

Major point deductions stem from these issues:
- Its recommendations are only partially data-driven. Some include invented details not grounded in the supplied data, e.g.:
    - “Re-allocate under-utilised Credit Assessment processors...” and “simulation indicates a 30 % reduction...” — there is no evidence for “under-utilised” staff, processor allocation specifics, or that a 30% reduction is calculable from any metric provided.
    - “Contract an external legal panel...” — the 8 hours (“first 8 h of queue”) is not derivable from the data; “expanding headcount” is not indicated in any metric.
    - “Double the Risk Review analyst pool...” — no headcount or application wave information allows a grounded recommendation about analyst numbers or timing (“Days 2-4”).
- It introduces an unnecessary intermediate statement: “Collectively these steps add 480 cases... for ~40 % of our volume,” which is not directly supported by the provided case numbers and data relationships.
- The memo format is less professional (e.g., casual heading), and does not indicate the total sample size, which the ground truth does.

Strictness requires subtraction for each invented extrapolation not directly justified by the table data, and the random simulation/statements about staffing. The overall structure, identification, and SLA-wait calculations are all correct, limiting the penalty.

Thus, the LLM’s answer scores 7.0.
