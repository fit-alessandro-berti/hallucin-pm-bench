4.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No"), which aligns with the ground truth. However, it contains significant errors in the justification: Rule 1 is incorrectly marked as violated (QE does precede RA, satisfying the order, despite NA in between, which Rule 1 does not prohibit); Rule 2 is factually wrong (VP occurs after RA in the trace, satisfying it for high severity); Rule 3 is correctly violated; Rule 4 is correctly satisfied. These misanalyses (two rules wrongly flagged as violated, with additional erroneous reasoning about sequence) represent major deviations from the ground truth, warranting substantial point deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
