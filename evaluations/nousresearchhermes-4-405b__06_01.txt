6.5

The LLM answer provides the correct pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel in Process B. However, the formatting does **not** match the required format specified in the user instructions and shown exactly in the ground truth:

- The pairs should be output one per line, using the format `Task_X  —  Task_Y`, with exactly two spaces on both sides of the em dash.
- The LLM answer omits the extra spaces before and after the em dash, and uses a normal dash (hyphen-minus or possibly an en dash), not an em dash.
- The list should be in **alphabetical order** both within each pair **and** in the overall list. While the pairs themselves are in correct order, within “Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines” the order matches but the formatting error stands.

Due to these formatting errors (spacing and dash character), and based on the instruction for utmost strictness and significant loss of points for small errors, a **significant penalty** is appropriate. Substantive content is correct, but the formatting does not follow instructions:

- Content correctness: 10
- Formatting accuracy (very important per instructions): -3.5

Final Score: **6.5**
