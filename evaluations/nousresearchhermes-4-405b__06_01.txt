The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs of parallel tasks from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), orders them alphabetically both within pairs and overall, and outputs one per line in the specified format. This matches the ground truth content and intent perfectly, with no factual errors or omissions. However, under utmost strictness, minor formatting discrepancies deduct points: (1) lack of the code block (```) enclosing the output as shown in the ground truth; (2) inconsistent spacing around the em dash (appears to use single spaces instead of the double space before the em dash implied by the prompt's format example "Task_X  —  Task_Y"); (3) no alignment padding spaces in the second line (ground truth uses extra spaces like "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines" for visual alignment); and (4) extraneous double spaces at the end of the first line ("Quality_Check  "). These small presentation issues, while not affecting correctness, warrant a deduction of 1.0 point for failing to mirror the ground truth output precisely. No rationale was required or provided in the LLM answer, which is appropriate.
