The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring A as instructed), in perfect alphabetical order both within pairs and overall list. The task names, order, and separator format ("  —  ") match closely. Deductions for:
- Unnecessary introductory text (violates "output one pair per line" implication of concise list-only response; -0.5)
- Lack of code block markdown (as in ground truth; -0.3)
- Minor spacing misalignment on second pair (not column-aligned like ground truth; -0.2)

No content errors, no hallucinated pairs, perfect adherence to process logic. Under utmost strictness, not a pixel-perfect match to ground truth structure (e.g., no rationale), but functionally superior to many alternatives.
