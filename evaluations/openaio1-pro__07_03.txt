The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed task, and gateway type changes) with precise IDs, names, and type transitions matching the ground truth content. However, it deducts points for formatting inconsistencies: absence of bullet points (-) before each item (missing in all 6 list entries), lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (no leading spaces before "exclusive â†’ parallel"), and minor whitespace variations after headings, which deviate from the ground truth's structured list style. These small presentation errors warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria, despite no factual inaccuracies.
