The LLM answer correctly identifies the key factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, it deviates from the ground truth in several ways that warrant point deductions under strict evaluation: (1) It lists only task IDs for added/removed tasks, rather than the exact names from the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" instead of just "check_vip"), which mismatches the ground truth's use of names with parenthetical IDs; this is a significant error as it does not "use the element names exactly as they appear" if interpreting "names" as the name attributes. (2) The gateway description is concise but lacks the explicit versioning ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)") and formatting (backticks, bold) of the ground truth. (3) Minor formatting differences in headings and bullets (e.g., â€¢ vs. **bold**) do not fully align, though the core heading text matches the prompt. No speculation or extraneous content is added, which is positive, but these omissions and mismatches prevent a higher score.
