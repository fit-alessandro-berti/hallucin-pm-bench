6.5

• Added tasks  
- The LLM answer lists the element names (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`) but fails to provide both the name and id as stated in the ground truth. This is a significant detail requirement in the ground truth.

• Removed tasks  
- Similarly, only the element name (`send_rma_label`) is provided and not the human-readable name or the id, which are required in the ground truth.

• Gateway type changes  
- The LLM answer states "gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway" instead of the more explicit phrasing of the ground truth, but it is factually correct and includes the id and the correct before/after types.

• Formatting & Headings  
- The answer doesn't match the exact heading formatting used in the ground truth (capitalization, bold, and bullet/asterisk usage), but the grouping is correct.

There are **no false positives** (no extra differences), and all differences are found and grouped correctly. The most significant deductions relate to not providing both name and id for the tasks as required, and to minor formatting/issues in label clarity per instruction. These are small but important errors for a strict evaluation.
