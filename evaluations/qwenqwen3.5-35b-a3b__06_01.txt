9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring Process A), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall, with "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" preceding "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"), and uses the correct task names and em dash format. However, under utmost strictness, there is a small but clear formatting difference: the ground truth aligns the em dashes vertically in monospace by adding extra spaces before the em dash in the second line ("Procure_Materials     —"), while the LLM uses consistent minimal spacing ("Procure_Materials  — ") matching the example format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` exactly on both lines without padding. This whitespace discrepancy constitutes a minor output difference, warranting a significant but not drastic deduction from 10.0. No other errors.
