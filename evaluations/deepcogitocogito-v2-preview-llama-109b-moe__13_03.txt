7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1 (Count)**: Perfect match to ground truth (exactly 1 occurrence identified correctly). No deductions.
- **Question 2 (Explanation)**: Concise and under 120 words (~110). Covers core ideas like small sample size (3 cases) and non-representativeness, including conditional triggers (e.g., high-risk cases) and potential for unreliable estimates—aligning broadly with ground truth's sampling error theme. However, significant deductions for:
  - Missing quantification of excerpt scale (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours), volatility example (0% to 7% swing), and rare event sampling error—key to showing "extreme" misestimation risk.
  - No mention of near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) causing string vs. fuzzy matching distortions.
  - Mild speculation (e.g., "daily/weekly cycles") violates "no speculation" rule, though minor.
  
Overall: Strong structure and relevance, but lacks ground truth's analytical precision and data-specific insights, warranting a mid-high score under strict criteria.
