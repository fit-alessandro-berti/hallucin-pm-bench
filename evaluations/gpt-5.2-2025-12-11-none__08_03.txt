**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" and the key insight (using T2b shortcut to enable T5 without T3 or pc), providing a valid prefix sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) where T5 fires without prior T3. This matches the core reasoning and demonstrates possibility under a strict "no prior T3" interpretation. However, under utmost strictness vs. ground truth:

- **Major difference**: Provides incomplete/wrong "shortest firing sequence" (4 steps vs. ground truth's 6-step 〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉 explicitly showing T5 *before* T3 in a full sequence where both fire). Query likely requires sequence proving order (T5 position < T3 position), including both transitions; LLM omits T6/T3 and feedback loop, failing to "achieve this order."
- **Missing details**: No step-by-step markings, no "Why this works" explanation, no mention of T6 reinjecting to pc for post-T5 T3, no proof of minimality/lower bound (claims 4-step "shortest" but ignores full order).
- **Structural diffs**: Brief reasoning vs. detailed, formatted sequence + analysis; no arrow/emphasis on order.

These are significant omissions/errors (wrong sequence length/content, incomplete proof), warranting major deduction despite shared insight. Equivalent to partial credit.
