**9.2**

The LLM answer is factually correct, provides the exact minimal sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] matching the ground truth, and includes a valid explanation confirming T5 precedes T3 (with T3 disabled afterward). Both are under 120 words.

Minor deductions for:
- No explicit markings (M₁–M₅) to verify states step-by-step (-0.5).
- Q1 lacks ground truth's brief causal explanation (-0.2).
- Sequence as compact list vs. numbered steps with markings (-0.1).

Strict but high score due to identical core content/sequence and no errors.
