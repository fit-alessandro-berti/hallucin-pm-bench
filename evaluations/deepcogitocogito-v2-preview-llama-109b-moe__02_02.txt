- **A1 (Distinct cases):** Correct in both counting and value (3). Full point.
- **A2 (Sequence for C002):** Sequence is exactly correct and ordered, including correct separators and activity names. Full point.
- **A3 (Distinct activities preceding "Ship_Order"):** Content is correct (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock) and alphabetically ordered as requested. However, the LLM formatted the activity names as written, with a space instead of an underscore. The correct answers use underscore ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), and the prompt/sample use underscores in all activity names. This is a minor but clear error per the strictness requirement.

Due to answer A3 listing the activity names as "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" (without underscores), which deviates from the provided log's notation (“Arrange_Delivery”, not “Arrange Delivery”), **this constitutes a minor formatting error**. 

With utmost strictness, this is a significant formatting inconsistency. According to your instruction, small errors should reflect in significant point loss.

**Total: 9.0**  
(Reason: One formatting error in a core answer; otherwise factually precise.)
