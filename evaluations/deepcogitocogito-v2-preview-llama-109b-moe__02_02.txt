9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, though score is primary):
- **A1**: Factually correct (3 distinct cases), but includes unnecessary verbose phrasing ("distinct cases are present in this fragment") not present in the concise ground truth ("**3**"). This is a minor difference but deducts points under strictness for exactness. (Score impact: -0.5)
- **A2**: Exact match in sequence and separators; minor formatting (quotes around "C002" and backticks around sequence) is negligible and doesn't alter content. Escaped underscores in ground truth are a presentation artifact, not a substantive difference. (Score impact: 0 deduction)
- **A3**: Content and alphabetical order perfectly match (Arrange_Delivery precedes Check_Stock). Lacks the ground truth's dashes ("-") and HTML `<br>` tags, but uses equivalent newlines for "one per line" as prompted. No extras or misses. (Score impact: 0 deduction)
- **Overall**: The core answers are precise and hallucination-free, correctly parsing the log (e.g., predecessors for "Ship_Order" are accurate across cases). However, the extensive introductory reasoning text (e.g., "Okay, let's tackle...") is extraneous compared to the ground truth's concise table format, treated as a difference under strict evaluation rules for added, unrequested elements. This results in a high but not perfect score despite factual accuracy.
