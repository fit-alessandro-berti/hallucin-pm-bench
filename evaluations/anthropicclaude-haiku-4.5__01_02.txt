4.5

### Evaluation Rationale

#### Overall Assessment
The LLM answer is partially accurate but contains critical errors in identifying and structuring the **decision points**, which is the core of the prompt ("Summarise the **decision points**"). The required documents section is nearly identical to the ground truth and the source process description, earning high marks there. However, under strict evaluation criteria, the inclusion of extraneous elements (e.g., Quick KYC as a "decision point"), incorrect sequencing (e.g., placing KYC first and omitting explicit ties to prior steps like Neighbourhood Feedback Check), and minor omissions (e.g., not specifying the post-NFC position for Amount Threshold) result in significant deductions. These are not minor phrasing issues but misinterpretations of what constitutes a "decision point" (i.e., branching gates like alignment or thresholds, not routine verifications). The ground truth is concise, focused on true decisions, and precisely positioned, highlighting these flaws.

#### Breakdown by Section

1. **Decision Points (Major Errors – Heavy Deduction)**:
   - **Strengths (Partial Credit)**: Correctly identifies and describes the Underwriter Alignment Gate (including ≤2 vs. >2 points and escalation to Harmonisation Committee) and Amount Threshold Decision (with accurate <€15,000 auto-approval and ≥€15,000 escalation). Also correctly notes MBA as a vote-based approve/reject for larger amounts.
   - **Weaknesses (Significant Loss)**:
     - Erroneously includes **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** as the first "decision point" (listed as #1). This is a mandatory verification step, not a decision branch—it's always performed without alternatives, per the process flow. Ground truth omits it entirely, as it doesn't involve choices. This adds an irrelevant item, bloating the list and misaligning with the prompt's focus on "decision points" (branches/gates).
     - Incorrect sequencing and context: LLM presents decisions in a linear "in sequence" list starting with KYC, then Alignment, Amount, and MBA, but omits that Amount Threshold follows **after Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** (ground truth explicitly states this). This disrupts the process flow (e.g., NFC is skipped in LLM's narrative).
     - Redundant listing of MBA as a separate #4 "decision point" after Amount Threshold, even though it's conditional (only for ≥€15,000). Ground truth integrates it cleanly as #3 without redundancy.
     - Minor phrasing: LLM says "proceed to disburse" for <€15,000 (accurate but jumps to end); ground truth stops at "system auto-approves." LLM's elaboration (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split") is helpful but not in ground truth, which is more succinct.
   - **Impact**: This section should be ~70% of the evaluation weight (as it's the primary prompt element). Accuracy is ~60% due to two core decisions being right but undermined by extras and flow errors. Strict penalty: -4.0 points from max.

2. **Required Documents (Strong – Minimal Deduction)**:
   - **Strengths**: Lists all six exact items from the source process without additions or omissions: Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01), Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old), Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip), Community Impact Statement (CIS) template, Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet, Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF). Matches ground truth content precisely.
   - **Weaknesses (Minor Loss)**:
     - Phrasing variations: LLM uses full descriptions (e.g., "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)"), while ground truth abbreviates (e.g., "Latest Income Statement (pay-stub/tax slip)"). This is faithful to the original process but not identical to ground truth—small strictness penalty.
     - Ground truth includes an extra note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), emphasizing the non-standard nature (per system prompt). LLM omits this, missing a subtle reinforcement of the "no standard loan terminology" rule.
   - **Impact**: ~30% weight. Near-perfect (~95% match), but tiny divergences cost -0.5 points.

#### Cumulative Scoring
- Base: 10.0 (perfect match).
- Deductions: -5.0 for decision points errors (extra item, sequence/context issues); -0.5 for documents phrasing/omission.
- Final: 4.5. This reflects strictness—small errors (phrasing) lose ~0.5, but structural ones (wrong decisions) lose much more. The answer is informative but not faithful enough to the ground truth's precision and focus.
