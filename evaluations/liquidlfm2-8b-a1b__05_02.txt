The LLM answer fails catastrophically by outputting the full XML instead of a single-hunk unified diff, violates core rules by adding multiple invalid sequence flows (e.g., sourceRef on flows, non-existent elements), altering task types (serviceTask to userTask), duplicating/modifying task names and elements without permission, and providing a nonsensical multi-sentence rationale that doesn't address SLA compliance logically; it bears zero resemblance to the ground truth's simple, rule-compliant dueDate adjustment.
