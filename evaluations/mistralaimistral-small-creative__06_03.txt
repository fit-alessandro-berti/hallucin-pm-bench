The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt and ground truth. It stays focused solely on Process B with no extraneous information. Deduction of 0.5 points for minor stylistic differences: extra introductory sentence, divergent labeling ("First Parallel Split (#1)" vs. "Set 1 – first parallel block"), bullet-point formatting instead of inline `backticks` with ‖ notation, and absence of the closing "No other tasks..." statement. No factual errors or omissions in content.
