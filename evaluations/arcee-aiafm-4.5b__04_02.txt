The LLM answer has multiple critical errors: R1 incorrectly claims only one approval (ignores initial Manager then Finance sequence, violating R1's "followed by"); R2 wrongly deems compliant by ignoring Change_Request resetting the approval timeline (Ship_Goods violates 2-day window post-new approval); R5 incorrectly compliant with vague justification (ignores pre-new-approval steps like Ship_Goods/Pay_Invoice); overall erroneously COMPLIANT despite evident violations. Only R3, R4, R6 partially align; formats deviate slightly from â‰¤20-word limit and structure.
