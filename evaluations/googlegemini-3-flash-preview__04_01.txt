8.0

The LLM answer is largely correct in identifying non-compliance due to violations of Rules 2 and 3, with accurate event citations for those violations and brief but correct notes on Rules 1, 4, and 5. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Format/structure mismatch (-1.0):** Uses numbered list only for violations (labeled as "1. Violation of Rule 2", etc.), with satisfied rules in a separate "**Note**" section. Ground truth systematically numbers justifications 1-5 for *all* rules explicitly (satisfied or violated), followed by a summary. This deviates from a fully parallel "numbered justification" covering the rule set comprehensively.
- **Numerical error in Rule 3 (-1.0):** States "distance of 4 activities" while listing exactly 3 intervening activities (7,8,9); ground truth specifies "distance = 3". This internal inconsistency and divergence from ground truth's calculation is a small but precise error warranting significant deduction.
- **Minor phrasing incompleteness:** Rule 4 note omits ground truth's specific "event 4 (`System`) lies in between" (though correct overall); lacks ground truth's final summary sentence reinforcing overall non-compliance.

Core verdict, key facts, and rule citations align closely (90% match), justifying 8.0 rather than lower.
