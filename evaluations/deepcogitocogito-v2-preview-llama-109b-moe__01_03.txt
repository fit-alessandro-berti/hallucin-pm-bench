**Rationale:**

**a) Decision points:**
- The LLM answer identifies three decision points: (1) Tri-Color-Risk-Check, (2) the risk/amount skip, and (3) the TriVote.
- The **ground truth** only acknowledges two:  
  - The conditional skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check (conditional branch)
  - The TriVote approval gate.
- The LLM incorrectly identifies the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a decision point, rather than the risk-based conditional branch that follows it. This is a significant conceptual error, as the ground truth only considers the branch based on the risk outcome and requested amount—not the scoring step itself—as a decision point.
- The LLM’s decision point wording is less precise than required (e.g., for TriVote, does not state “at least two of three approvers must approve,” but simply “any two approvals sufficient for passing”).
- LLM’s text is somewhat verbose, and, although functional, is not as direct as the ground truth.

**b) Documents:**
- The LLM omits to **separately list** the three scorecards (Scorecard-Cyan, Scorecard-Magenta, Scorecard-Yellow)—instead referring to them collectively in one bullet. The ground truth lists all three distinctly, as required.
- LLM otherwise lists the correct documents and in the right order.
- There is no hallucination (it does not mention KYC/AML docs or credit-bureau files).

**Scoring justification:**  
- Significant deduction for mischaracterizing decision points (+/-1.0 point for each main conceptual error).
- Deductions for *not* listing all documents explicitly as required (fusing the scorecards).
- Minor deduction for non-crisp phrasing/lack of conciseness in mapping to ground truth.
- No hallucinations, most content is correct, and the core flow is followed.

**Summary:** LLM demonstrates basic understanding but materially deviates regarding what constitutes a decision point and fails to enumerate all required documents distinctively.
