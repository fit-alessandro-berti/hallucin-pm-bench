The LLM answer is an exact semantic and structural match to the ground truth: both correctly identify the impossibility due to absent data (redacted rows and timestamps in Artefact A), precisely explain the lack of start_time/complete_time values preventing cycle time/duration calculations and thus statistics (average, std dev/dispersion, CI), limit to one short paragraph without guessing/computing/using external knowledge, and specify relevance to "Approve Invoice". Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "executable data" vs. "necessary data"; "derived from the provided artefacts" vs. "Additional raw log entries are required") are stylistic, not errors, preserving full fidelity under strict criteria.
