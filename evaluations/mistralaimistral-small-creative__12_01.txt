9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment):** Correct verdict ("not accurate" vs. "inaccurate"; both conclude false). Covers all 3 cases identically in facts: reversal in 1001/1003 (citing sequences/activities as requested), absence in 1002 disproves claim. Strict data adherence, no guessing. Evidence-based with case IDs and activities.
- **Differences/Deductions (strict penalties):**
  - Phrasing imprecision: Case 1002 labeled "irrelevant"/"cannot hold" (-0.4); ground truth precisely ties to disproving "“always”".
  - Misses line citations (e.g., "lines 3-4", "11 &14") (-0.2); data presented as lines.
  - Less concise: Full sequences exceed "short justification" vs. ground truth's bullets/targeted excerpts (-0.2).
- No factual errors; substance ~95% match, but strictness demands deductions for phrasing/conciseness/minor omissions.
