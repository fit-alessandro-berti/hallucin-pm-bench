**2.0**

The LLM answer fundamentally fails to meet the SLA: it skips "Task_Triage" on timeout (routing to a new End Event), violating "every claim must reach 'Triage Claim' within 48 hours." Ground truth bypasses *to* Task_Triage, ensuring compliance. Key differences:
- Wrong attachment: Task_RequestDocs (late, path-specific, ineffective for complete docs or prior delays) vs. Task_Receive (early, covers all paths).
- Wrong target/outcome: New "Escalation End Event" (skips triage; arguably adds unnecessary element) vs. reuse Task_Triage.
- Imprecise timer: Vague "48-hour from Start_Claim" (BPMN boundary timers measure from activity start) vs. explicit PT48H.
- No XML/IDs for new elements; assumes "bottleneck" incorrectly.
Minor merits (interrupting timer concept, brevity) outweighed by errors.
