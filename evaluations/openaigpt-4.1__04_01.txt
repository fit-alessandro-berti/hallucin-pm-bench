7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately flags violations in Rules 2 and 3, while affirming compliance in Rules 1, 4, and 5, matching the ground truth's core assessments. Both cite the same events and rule interpretations (e.g., Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods for Rule 2; Three_way_match outside the window for Rule 3). However, significant deductions apply due to strict criteria:

- **Major flaw (-2.0 points):** Inconsistent and erroneous labeling in Rule 3 justification—initially marked as "**Compliant**" before self-correcting to a violation, creating contradictory presentation and revealing flawed initial reasoning. This is a clear structural and logical error not present in the ground truth's clean, consistent format.
  
- **Minor errors (-0.5 points total):** 
  - Distance calculation for Rule 3 stated as "distance=4" (vs. ground truth's "distance=3"), a small numerical discrepancy that misaligns with precise event positioning (10-6=4 positions, but intervening activities=3; rule's "distance ≤ 2" intent is preserved, but inexact).
  - References "Rule 2.2" (non-existent; ground truth uses "Rule 2"), a trivial but avoidable inaccuracy.
  - Excessive verbosity: Adds unneeded sections ("Conclusion," "Major Violations," "Compliant on," "Summary") that bloat the response beyond the ground truth's concise, numbered structure ending directly in a brief overall statement.

The answer is substantively correct but undermined by presentation issues and minor inaccuracies, warranting a mid-high score under strict evaluation. A perfect match would require identical precision, structure, and error-free reasoning.
