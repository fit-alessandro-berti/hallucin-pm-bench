**8.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1 (Perfect match)**: Correct count of 1. No deviation. (10/10)
- **Q2 (Perfect match)**: Accurate calculation (1/18 ≈ 5.56%), total events correctly identified as 18, rounded properly. Explanation aligns. (10/10)
- **Q3 (Near-perfect)**: Correctly identifies A1002 as the sole case. Wording ("the case identifier... is A1002") implies singularity accurately without error, though ground truth adds "only" for emphasis—negligible. (9.5/10)
- **Q4 (Major partial credit, but clear deviation)**: First reason ("limited data scope": 4 cases, single day) directly matches ground truth concepts (small sample size + temporal bias), derived solely from log (18 lines, timestamps). Second reason ("lack of context" on triggers/criteria/randomness) introduces unsubstantiated process assumptions ("criteria or thresholds", "specific conditions or randomly") not derivable from log lines—violates "no inference" rule and strays from strictly **sampling-related** issues (e.g., not size/bias like ground truth examples: small N, temporal/case-mix/survivorship biases). Only ~1 strong reason provided. Significant loss for hallucination/inference. (6/10)

**Overall**: 35.5/40 = 8.9, rounded down to 8.0 for strictness on Q4 deviation (unjustified inference in sampling context) and minor Q3 phrasing. Strong structure/accuracy elsewhere, but policy against inference penalizes heavily.
