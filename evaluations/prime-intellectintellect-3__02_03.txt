**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all three questions, directly and concisely addressing them in bullet-point format as specified in the prompt. 

- Q1: "3" correctly states the number of distinct cases (verified: C123, C456, C789).
- Q2: "Pack_Items" exactly matches the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" for C456 (confirmed chronologically).
- Q3: "Cancel_Order" correctly identifies the unique activity (appears once; others appear 2–3 times).

Minor presentational differences vs. ground truth (e.g., no labels like **A1**, no case list or "cases" phrasing, - vs. * bullets, unescaped underscore) do not constitute errors under "utmost strictness," as the prompt demands *concise* bullet points only, the content is identical where essential, and no factual inaccuracy or incompleteness exists. Full match in substance warrants maximum score.
