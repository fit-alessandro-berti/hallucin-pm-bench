9.2

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely matches the ground truth. Here’s a strict breakdown:

- **Correctness of Answer**: The LLM gives the correct answer ("No").
- **Identification of Relevant Cases**: It accurately identifies both C002 and C004 as counterexamples, and cites C001 and C003 as conforming cases.
- **Activity Sequences Cited**: The LLM provides the concrete activity sequences for C002 and C004, matching those in the ground truth. It also gives the C001 and C003 sequences, showing full analysis.
- **Reasoning**: The reasoning explicitly states that the FACT cannot be true due to "always" in the claim, based on the violations seen in C002 and C004.
- **Small differences**:
    - The LLM does not explicitly present its findings in a table, as the ground truth does.
    - The ground truth calls out that "two out of four cases violate," quantifying; the LLM mentions both violators but doesn’t state the ratio.
    - The LLM’s “immediate successor” logic is correct but does not use that explicit terminology.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is thorough, correct, and justifies the decision using all relevant evidence. The only reason for not awarding a perfect score is the absence of explicit tabular format and minor variations in language/format compared to the ground truth.

**Strict score:** 9.2
