### Evaluation Reasoning:
The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides a thorough justification that aligns closely with the ground truth. It accurately cites all relevant CaseIDs (C001, C002, C003, C004), describes the activity sequences around "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment" for each, and identifies the intervening activities in C002 (Pack_Items) and C004 (Check_Fraud) as violations. It also notes the cases where the rule holds (C001, C003) and correctly interprets "always" as requiring universality across all instances, leading to the same conclusion.

**Minor deductions (-0.5 points):** The response uses a narrative format with timestamps (which are factual but not required by the task or ground truth), rather than the ground truth's structured table. This deviates slightly in presentation, though it does not introduce errors or omissions. Under utmost strictness, this stylistic difference reflects a small loss, but the core content, citations, and logic are equivalent. No factual inaccuracies or significant gaps.
