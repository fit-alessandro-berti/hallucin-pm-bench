The LLM answer is almost perfect and matches the ground truth in all respects except Q5. The LLM included "Quality_Check" in Q5 (activities that never appear as the first event of any case), but in fact, "Quality_Check" does start case C-77, so including it is a significant but single error. All other answers (Q1-Q4) are correct.

Due to a strict grading policy where any error is penalized notably, the mistaken inclusion of "Quality_Check" results in the reduction of one full point.
