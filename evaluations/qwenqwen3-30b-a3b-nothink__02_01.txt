8.0

The LLM answer is correct for Q1â€“Q4, matching the ground truth exactly. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an extra invalid item in the list. This factual error, even if isolated, warrants a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria, reducing the score from a potential perfect 10.0.
