The LLM answer correctly identifies that the value cannot be derived and provides a valid reason tied to the absence of elapsed-time data, aligning with the system's instruction to only answer if supported by data. This matches the ground truth's core conclusion. However, it loses points for being less comprehensive: it omits explicit mention of the lack of timestamps (also redacted per context), durations, and ordering information, which the ground truth highlights as essential for cycle-time computation. Additionally, it does not warn against fabricating a numeric answer, reducing depth and precision in the explanation. Under strict evaluation, these omissions represent minor but notable gaps in fidelity to the ground truth's detail.
