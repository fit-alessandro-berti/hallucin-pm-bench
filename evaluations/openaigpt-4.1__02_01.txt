8.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event for case C-77), resulting in an extra and erroneous item in the list. This is a clear factual error in interpreting the log, warranting a significant deduction despite the otherwise strong performance. Under strict evaluation, the score reflects near-perfect alignment with a notable flaw in one key response element.
