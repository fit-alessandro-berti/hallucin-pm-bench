7.0

The LLM answer is almost entirely correct, but there is a significant, explicit error in Q5:

- Q1: Correct.
- Q2: Correct.
- Q3: Correct.
- Q4: Correct.
- Q5: The LLM answer includes `"Quality_Check"` as never appearing as the first event of a case, but in case C-77, `"Quality_Check"` is the first eventâ€”that's a clear factual mistake from the log. The rest of the Q5 list matches the ground truth.

Given the explicit mistake on one value in Q5 (out of 5 questions, so 1/5 have an error), and as instructed to penalize even small mistakes with significant point loss, a deduction of 3 points is appropriate:

Final score: 7.0
