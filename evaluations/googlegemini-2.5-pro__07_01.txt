7.5

The LLM answer is mostly correct in its identification of changes, but there are a few notable shortcomings:

- The LLM did not use the exact element names as they appear in the XML (e.g., it omitted IDs like `check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`). The prompt asks for exact element names from the XML, which the ground truth obeys.
- The formatting of headings does not match what the prompt and ground truth specify (it uses "• **Added tasks**" instead of, e.g., "**Added tasks**" or an unformatted version). The prompt requires grouping under the “exact headings.”
- In the gateway change, the LLM is correct in substance, but does not mention the gateway’s element ID (`gw_valid`), which is a material omission per the instructions.

Content-wise, no fabricated or omitted changes, which is good, but these “small” format/element-naming errors are significant per instructions for strict evaluation.

Thus, a 2.5-point deduction for not using exact element names and IDs, and a partial deduction for not grouping exactly as required.
