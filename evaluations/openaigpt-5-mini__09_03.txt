The LLM answer thoroughly and correctly explains that none of the requested metrics can be computed, and specifies the precise reason: the absence of event rows and timestamps in Artefact A. It concretely references the need for per-event timestamps and links them to the calculation steps for mean, standard deviation, and confidence interval. This aligns strongly with the ground truth.

However, points are deducted for slight verbosity and for including more background explanation (e.g., referencing "sample mean, sample standard deviation, and sample size to construct a 95% CI") than was present in the concise ground truth. The answer also does not explicitly state that "additional raw log entries are required" (though it implies it), and could have been even more succinct as instructed.

Overall, the content and reasoning are correct, matching the requirements and corresponding closely to the ground truthâ€”but strict grading penalizes for exceeding the strictly necessary detail.
