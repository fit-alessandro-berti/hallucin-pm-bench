The LLM answer closely mirrors the ground truth in structure, content, and precision: both correctly identify the redaction of event rows and timestamps in Artefact A as the core issue preventing computation of the average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% CI; both explain the need for timestamp data to derive durations and statistics without guessing or using external knowledge; and both are concise one-paragraph responses in plain text. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., LLM's explicit mention of "sample size" and statistical steps is additive but not in ground truth, while ground truth's "dispersion" paraphrases "standard deviation" and adds a call for "additional raw log entries," which LLM implies but does not state verbatim), reflecting small deviations under strict evaluation.
