The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth: correct "Yes" for Q1, same minimal sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] demonstrating T5 firing before T3 (T3 absent), accurate explanation of the path preserving P2 token. Differences are only stylistic (narrative vs. marked states; no extra post-T5 note required by prompt). Fully compliant with ≤120 words, precise phrasing matches intent. No errors.
