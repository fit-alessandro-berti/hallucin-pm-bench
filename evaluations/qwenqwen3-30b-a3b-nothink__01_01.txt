7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies three main decision points (eligibility validation, pre-approval, and high-value branching), aligning broadly with the ground truth's three points. It also provides an accurate, complete list of all seven required documents without introducing extras, and properly notes the absence of the legacy activity. However, under strict evaluation:

- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, ~2.0 point deduction):** The summaries lack the ground truth's precise branching logic and outcomes (e.g., no explicit mention of "Not eligible → claim rejected" in point 1, or "Approved → payment; Rejected → ends" in the final approval). The LLM infers decisions from activities but does not capture the success/failure branches implied by the process constraints (e.g., "has succeeded"). The high-value branch is correctly placed but not tied as explicitly to post-PreApprove sequencing, and the "final payment approval" is fragmented across points 2-3 rather than combined. Listing partial documents per point adds unrequested detail, slightly deviating from the prompt's focus on summary and full list.

- **Documents List (Minor Strengths, no deduction):** Identical to ground truth in content, including conditional notes for *AuditTrail*. The explanations (e.g., for *BankTransferAuthorization*) are accurate and process-aligned.

- **Overall Fidelity (Minor Issues, ~1.0 point deduction):** Structure is logical but less tabular/concise than ground truth; the note on no extras is good but redundant to the prompt. No hallucinations, but precision gaps in decision outcomes reduce completeness.

This score reflects close alignment (~70% match) but penalizes incomplete branching details and minor structural variances as per strict criteria.
