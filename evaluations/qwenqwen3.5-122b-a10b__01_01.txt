6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major differences, ~60% of score weight)**: LLM identifies only 2 decision points, missing the ground truth's first (eligibility check in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**) and third (final approval/rejection at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**/**Senior_Auditor_Review**). LLM's #1 partially overlaps GT #3 but vaguely references triage without treating it as a distinct decision with explicit rejection outcome. GT #2 matches LLM #2 closely, but LLM's phrasing ("primary decision gates") undercounts. No table format; descriptive prose instead. Strict penalty for incompleteness and mismatch.
- **Required Documents (perfect match, ~30% weight)**: Identical list of 7 documents. Minor: LLM lacks GT's qualifier on *AuditTrail* (high-value only), but lists correctly without extras.
- **Other (minor, ~10% weight)**: Both note no legacy activity. LLM adheres to "do not introduce" rule. Structure is clear but diverges from GT's table/list.
- **Overall**: High-quality but incomplete on core task ("every decision point"); strict deduction for omissions/ref different branching details yields 6.0.
