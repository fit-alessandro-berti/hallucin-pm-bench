**2.0**

### Key Differences Penalized (Strict Evaluation):
- **Format mismatch (major, -4.0)**: LLM uses verbose, pseudo-BPMN-2.0 XML-in-JSON ("definitions", "process", "sequenceFlow", etc.); ground truth uses simple custom schema ("process_id", "elements", "flows"). Incompatible structures.
- **Missing/invented elements (-2.0)**: Extra ParseEmailTask, lanes, Transaction/ActivityScope, SimpleGateway, signal; missing eventBasedGateway, customerReply event, timer as intermediateCatchEvent properly; ProvideResolution skipped for Complex path (hallucination/missing core flow).
- **Flow/logic errors (-1.5)**: Duplicate paths to RootCauseAnalysis (Flow5 + Flow7); timer modeled as non-interruptible sequenceFlow (always ~24h delay, no immediate close on reply); parallel fork/join misplaced (syncs log with delayed close, not reply-wait); classification routing broken.
- **Cancel modeling (-0.3)**: Boundary signal on transaction vs. standalone message catch (incomplete in both, but mismatched).
- **Minor (-0.2)**: Names differ (e.g., start "Support e-mail received" vs. "Email Received"); invented conditions/variables; malformed BPMN (e.g., StartEvent not in flowElement, associations misuse).
- No escalation hallucination (no penalty avoidance). Total faithful translation fails on core wait/reply/resolution logic.
