The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth. The brief explanation accurately describes the path enabling T5 before T3 while preserving the P2 token. However, it lacks the structured Q1/Q2 formatting, explicit markings (M1–M5) for each step, and the ground truth's confirmation that T5 disables T3 afterward, reducing completeness and pedagogical value despite staying under 120 words. No factual errors, but omissions in detail warrant a deduction under strict criteria.
