3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer attempts a basic BPMN structure but contains critical omissions and inaccuracies when strictly compared to the ground truth and prompt requirements. Under utmost strictness, even minor deviations (e.g., naming, missing attributes) incur heavy penalties, while functional errors (e.g., broken paths) are disqualifying. Key issues:

- **Major Functional Error (Severe Deduction: -4.0 points)**: No sequence flow from `t2` ("Provide Reset Instructions") to `t5` ("Confirm with Customer"). This dead-ends the "Password Reset" path (lines 3, 7-10), preventing closure or looping. Ground truth explicitly connects via `f5` (t2 → t6), ensuring all resolutions reach confirmation. This breaks the process model, violating "translate ... exactly as stated" and the loop/end conditions.

- **Structural Omission (Heavy Deduction: -1.5 points)**: No `<process>` element (e.g., `<process id="support_ticket" ...>`), which is standard for BPMN 2.0 XML and present in ground truth. The top-level `<definitions>` alone is incomplete/invalid without it.

- **Missing Gateway/Element Details (Moderate Deduction: -0.5 points each, total -1.0)**: 
  - No `name` attributes on gateways (e.g., ground truth: `gw1 name="Password Reset?"`), sequence flows lack `<conditionExpression>` (e.g., "yes"/"no" for exclusive gateways, essential for decisions per lines 3, 5, 8).
  - Start/end lack names (ground: "Ticket Submitted"/"Ticket Closed").

- **Naming Inaccuracies (Minor but Strict Deduction: -0.3 points each, total -0.5)**: "Classify Ticket" deviates from "automatically classified by the system" (ground: "Auto-Classification"). Other task names match exactly (e.g., "Initial Diagnosis"), but inconsistency penalizes precision.

- **Strengths (Partial Credit: +2.0 baseline)**: Concise IDs (`t1`, `gw1`), under 40 lines (~26), two main gateways modeled (class/diagnosis; third for confirm is implied/required by line 8, matching ground truth despite prompt's "two"). Rework loop (gw3 → t3 per line 9) correct. No hallucinations (no added timers/escalations). Forward-to-specialist (t6 → t4) and resolve paths align.

Overall, the model is ~60% structurally sound but non-executable due to the broken path and omissions, warranting a low score. A perfect match would require line-by-line fidelity to ground truth.
