**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks (perfect match, +2.5/3.0)**: Correctly identifies all 3 new tasks by ID/name (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject). Minor deduction for unnecessary descriptive phrases (e.g., "to start the process").
- **Removed tasks (major errors, +0.2/3.0)**: Critical failures—incorrectly lists Task_ApproveLoan as removed/replaced (same ID exists in v2, only cosmetic name change to ignore); wrongly claims Task_RejectLoan "renamed" to Task_FinalReject (different ID, so only Reject Loan is truly removed); contradictory notes and vague "replaced" logic contradict instructions/ground truth (only Task_RejectLoan removed). Significant point loss for inaccuracy.
- **Gateway-type changes (strong match, +1.0/2.0)**: Correctly identifies change (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision). Minor deduction for referencing cosmetic name change ("Eligibility Check") in summary, which should be ignored.
- **Format/Structure/Fidelity (-1.5 total)**: Uses exact headings but adds unrequested "---" dividers, extra "Summary" section, chit-chat ("Let me know..."), bolding inconsistent with ground truth, and notes that confuse analysis. Violates "strictly under the three requested headings" and introduces noise.
- **Overall strictness**: ~58% alignment (2 core sections good, 1 critically flawed + extras); small errors (e.g., descriptions) compounded by large ones (wrong removals) result in substantial deduction per instructions.
