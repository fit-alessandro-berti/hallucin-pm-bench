6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but exhibits notable differences in structure, completeness, and precision for the core task of summarizing **decision points**, warranting a strict deduction. The documents list is nearly identical (matching all items, conditional note on *AuditTrail*, and avoidance of extras), which preserves some points there. However, the decision points section shows substantive gaps:

- **Completeness of Decision Points**: Ground truth identifies three distinct points with explicit branching logic/outcomes (eligibility check with rejection; amount threshold with skip/branch; final approval with reject/end). LLM identifies three points but conflates or omits key elements: (1) Covers eligibility but omits explicit "not eligible → rejected/returned" outcome; (2) Frames pre-approval as a standalone financial eligibility decision without rejection branching; (3) Treats high-value branch as the primary "additional decision" but misses integrating it as a post-threshold approval step and omits rejection outcomes in auditor review or pre-approval. This results in an incomplete summary of *every* decision, including the "final payment approval" that could end the process without payment.

- **Precision and Fidelity**: LLM uses narrative descriptions without the ground truth's structured table format (including explicit "Branching logic / outcomes"), leading to less clarity on outcomes (e.g., no mention of process termination on rejection). Minor phrasing issues include "over €1 000" (vs. ground truth/process's "greater than €1 000") and added interpretive details like "decides if the claim meets eligibility" or "financially eligible" without direct process language. The legacy activity note is present but not as concisely tied to documents.

- **Overall Strictness**: The prompt demands strict adherence without introducing undefined elements; while LLM avoids inventions, the decision summary's differences (e.g., missing explicit rejections and branching) represent core inaccuracies, not minor. Documents earn full credit, but decision points (half the task) drag the score down significantly. Total: Strong on listing (8/10), weak on decisions (4/10), averaged to 6.0.
