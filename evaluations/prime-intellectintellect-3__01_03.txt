**4.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
**Part (a) - Decision Points (max ~5.0 points):**  
- Ground truth identifies **exactly 2** decision points/gates: (1) the post-Tri-Color skip conditional (Step 4), (2) TriVote (Step 6).  
- LLM incorrectly lists **3**, misclassifying the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself (Step 3) as a "decision point" (it's a risk-rating computation providing *input* to the Step 4 branch, not a gate/branch with a rule). This adds an extraneous item with an inaccurate summary ("Outputs a risk rating...").  
- LLM's summaries for the true points are mostly accurate (Step 4 phrasing matches closely; Step 6 captures "any two suffice" per process, though ground truth uses "at least two record 'Approve'").  
- Errors: Wrong count (-1.5), hallucinated decision point (-1.0), minor phrasing diffs (-0.3). **Score: 2.2/5.0**.

**Part (b) - Documents (max ~5.0 points):**  
- Ground truth lists **9** documents in precise first-appearance order: Form 14B (1), three Scorecards (2-4, explicit "Inputs" to Step 3), Deck Memo (5), Offer Sheet 77 (6, Step 7), **Signed** Offer Sheet 77 (7, Step 8 as distinct), ID Matrix Declaration (8), Loan Dossier 2025 (9).  
- LLM lists only **5**, omitting **all three Scorecards** (critical hallucination/oversight, as they are explicitly named process inputs/documents). Fails to list "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as separate (Step 8 explicitly distinguishes it; LLM's note dismisses it arbitrarily). Order of listed items is correct but incomplete.  
- Errors: Missing 4/9 items (-2.5), incorrect treatment of Signed doc (-1.0), no hallucinations of banned items (KYC/etc.) but massive omissions. **Score: 1.5/5.0**.  

**Overall:** Significant structural/omission errors outweigh partial accuracies; strict penalty for incompleteness and misidentification per instructions. Total deductions reflect "small errors" amplified and major gaps.
