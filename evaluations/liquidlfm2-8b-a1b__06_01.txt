1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally flawed and deviates massively from the ground truth. It misses one entire parallel pair (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), incorrectly includes multiple non-parallel pairs (e.g., Create_Documentation — Fabricate, Pack — Quality_Check, Quality_Check — Fabricate), uses inconsistent and abbreviated task names (e.g., "Pack" instead of "Package", "Manufacturing_Work_Order_" prefixes), fails to alphabetize properly within pairs and overall, adds extraneous explanatory text and invalid commentary instead of a clean list, and violates the exact output format (one pair per line, no extras). Even the one partially correct pair (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check) is buried in noise and error. This is not a minor deviation—it's a complete failure to identify and list only the two specified parallel pairs accurately.
