9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (Core Strength, 10.0)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the ground truth precisely: {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory} for the first parallel construct and {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement} for the second. It numbers the sets in the correct order (1 then 2) and focuses solely on Process B with no mention of A or C, fully adhering to the prompt's instructions.
  
- **Completeness (Minor Deduction, -0.3)**: The ground truth includes an explicit confirmatory statement ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel"), which ensures exhaustive coverage. The LLM omits this, though the prompt doesn't explicitly require it—slight incompleteness under strictness.

- **Formatting and Phrasing (Minor Deduction, -0.3)**: The LLM uses a bulleted list with descriptive headers referencing "parallel split (#1/#2)" (which directly echoes the process description), but deviates from the ground truth's numbered list, bolded titles, backticks, and ‖ symbol for parallelism. This is a small stylistic mismatch: the LLM's format is clear and functional but not identical, warranting a strict penalty for not mirroring the ground truth's structure. The added title "(Parallel Construct Sets)" is extraneous but not erroneous.

- **Overall Strictness**: No factual errors or omissions in task identification; deductions are limited to polish and exact replication. Under utmost strictness, even these nuances reduce from a perfect 10.0, but the answer is highly effective and prompt-compliant.
