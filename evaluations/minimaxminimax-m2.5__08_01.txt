The LLM answer is correct, complete, and flawlessly executes the prompt requirements: affirms "yes" with a precise, valid firing sequence (T1→T2→T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, accurate markings in a clear table, and a brief justification correctly explaining the inhibitor arc enabling condition (p3≥1 ∧ p4=0). No factual errors, deadlocks, or invalid steps—superior to the ground truth's erroneous continuation (T4 impossible post-T5 as p3=0).

**Minor deductions (-0.5):** 
- Lacks ground truth's deeper insight ("must fire before T3 if ever"; permanence of disablement post-T3 via inhibitor + T4 semantics)—a richer proof of *why* only pre-T3 is possible, though not strictly required by prompt's "brief justify."
- Stylistic/structure differences (table vs. list; no full post-T3 trace, though unnecessary).
- Phrasing variances (e.g., "fires before T3 ever fires" vs. "T5 before T3").

Utmost strictness applied; substance matches 95%+ (core sequence/justif identical), but non-exact match to GT's extras costs slightly.
