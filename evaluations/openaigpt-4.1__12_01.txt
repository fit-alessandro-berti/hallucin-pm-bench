9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate, closely mirroring the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate/not accurate), structure (short justification with case-by-case evidence), and key facts (reversed order in Cases 1001 and 1003; absence in 1002 disproves "always"; no instance of the claimed immediate precedence). Minor deductions for: (1) slightly awkward phrasing in the conclusion ("does not always occur ... in any case," which conflates "always" with "any" but remains logically sound); (2) lack of line references for precision; and (3) extraneous detail on "Quality_Check" (not wrong, but unneeded for strict evidence-matching). These are small but warrant a strict 0.5-point loss under the evaluation criteria.
