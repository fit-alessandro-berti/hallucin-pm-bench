**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Vocabulary (major strict requirement)**: Perfect match (+2.0 points). Uses exact "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"; no forbidden terms.
- **Structure**: Activities match exactly in name/order/capitalization/correct synonyms (+1.0). Columns match roles (+0.5). Basic table format present (+0.5).
- **RACI Content**: Fundamentally divergent (-7.0 major penalty). 
  - Responsibles (R) in correct column per narrative per row, but formatted as "R,A" vs. "**R**" or "**R / A**".
  - No Accountable (A) separation/distribution (e.g., misses AM as A for KYC Review/Payment Clearance; assumes A always with R).
  - Completely missing Consulted (C)/Informed (I) assignments (all rows have blanks vs. full cells in ground truth; 0/24 cells align closely).
  - Each row has ~75%+ cell mismatch.
- **Formatting/Details**: Minor divergences compound strictly (-1.0): "R,A" vs. "**R / A**" or "**R**"; abbrevs in headers; numbered/bold activities vs. ground truth styling; no blanks explanation needed.
- **Unwarranted Content**: Title, key, and blank explanation are extras not in ground truth (-1.0).
- **Overall**: ~30% alignment (vocab/structure/partial R); massive content gaps per strict rubric.
