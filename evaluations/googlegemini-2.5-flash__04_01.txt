8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correct Overall Decision (Weight: High)**: Both the LLM answer and ground truth correctly classify the trace as "Non-compliant" based on violations in Rules 2 and 3. This alignment on the core outcome warrants a strong base score.
- **Justification Completeness (Weight: Medium-High)**: The LLM identifies and justifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with specific event citations, matching the ground truth's violated rules. However, it omits analysis of Rules 1, 4, and 5 (which the ground truth confirms are satisfied), making it incomplete as a full audit. This partial coverage deducts points for thoroughness.
- **Accuracy of Details (Weight: High)**: 
  - Rule 2: Perfect match—both note the reversed order of `Risk_Assessment` (#9) after `Ship_Goods` (#8).
  - Rule 3: Correctly identifies violation, but minor discrepancy in distance calculation (LLM states "distance of 4" with explicit counting; ground truth states "distance = 3"). Under strict evaluation, this semantic difference in interpreting "distance ≤ 2" (likely intervening activities vs. step count) is a small error but impacts precision, leading to a notable deduction.
- **Format and Clarity (Weight: Low-Medium)**: LLM follows the required format ("Non-compliant" followed by numbered justifications citing rules). Explanations are clear and concise, aligning well with the prompt's expectations.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: No major factual errors or hallucinations, but incompleteness and the distance nuance prevent a perfect score. Overall, strong but not exhaustive fidelity to the ground truth.
