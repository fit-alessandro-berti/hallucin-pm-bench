2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (full credit, but minor weight)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This aligns perfectly with the prompt and rubric.
- **Structure (partial credit)**: The matrix format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced (rubric compliance). However, headers include unnecessary abbreviations (e.g., "(AM)"), which the ground truth omits—small but unwarranted addition per strict rubric (-0.5 impact). The extra legend and note are not in the ground truth and constitute unwarranted content, diluting focus on the core output (-0.5 impact).
- **RACI Allocations (major deductions, core failure)**: This is the primary mismatch, warranting severe point loss under strict evaluation. The narrative implies clear Responsibilities (R) based on handlers (AM for Receive/Order Vetting/Notify; CO for KYC; FC for Payment; IT for Record Update), which the LLM gets right (one R per row, as noted). However:
  - **No Accountability (A) assignments**: Ground truth assigns A (or R/A) to AM for Receive, Order Vetting, Payment, and Notify (reflecting AM's oversight role in the workflow). LLM ignores A entirely, defaulting to C or nothing—fundamental omission (-2.0).
  - **Misuse of C vs. I**: LLM overuses C (consulted) for uninvolved parties, ignoring the narrative's siloed roles. Examples:
    - Receive: FC/IT as C (should be I).
    - KYC: AM as C (should be A); IT as C (should be I).
    - Order Vetting: AM as R (incomplete vs. R/A); FC/IT as C (should be I).
    - Payment: AM as C (should be A); IT as C (should be I).
    - Record Update: CO as C (should be I).
    - Notify: AM as R (incomplete vs. R/A); CO/FC/IT as C (should be I).
    This affects ~70% of non-R cells (12+ errors), treating non-actors as consulted rather than informed—significant inaccuracy in RACI principles (-3.0).
  - Ground truth uses I for peripheral involvement (e.g., CO only central to KYC), which LLM violates broadly.
- **Overall Strictness**: With ~15 cell-level differences (plus missing A framework), the answer diverges substantially from ground truth despite superficial alignment. It does not "reflect the narrative" fully (rubric), leading to a low score. Minor positives (terminology, single R) prevent a 1.0, but errors are not "small" and compound to invalidate usability.
