7.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The three mandated terms (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”) are used correctly and in proper spelling and capitalization. None of the forbidden terms appears.
- No unwarranted content is introduced (no extra activities, roles, or columns).

**Errors / Point Deductions:**
1. **RACI Allocations:**
   - The model allocates only “R” and “C” (Responsible & Consulted) and omits “A” (Accountable) and “I” (Informed) for all activities. The ground truth answer assigns both “R” and “A” to some activities (most notably, “Account Manager” is both Responsible and Accountable in multiple activities), and makes regular use of “I.” This omission is significant.
   - Several activities (“Receive Application,” “Order Vetting,” “Notify Customer”) in the ground truth have “R/A” for Account Manager, not just “R.”
   - For “KYC Review,” the ground truth sets the Compliance Officer to “R,” Account Manager to “A,” and other roles as “C” and “I.” The model gives CO “R” but AM only “C”—this misrepresents primary accountability.
   - “Payment Clearance:” The model gives FC “R,” but Account Manager is only “C” (should be “A”), and IT/CO get “C” when they should be “I” or “C.”
   - For “Record Update” and “Notify Customer,” the use of “I” (Informed) is missing across all entries in the model’s matrix.

2. **Matrix Legend:**
   - “A” and “I” are listed in the legend, but not used in the matrix, which is misleading.

3. **Explanation Rationale:**
   - The note “A single ‘R’ per row is assigned as per standard RACI principles” is not appropriate; RACI matrices commonly allow for both an R and A on the same activity (sometimes to the same person), as in the ground truth.

**Conclusion:**
- The answer is accurate on terminology and overall structure but diverges fundamentally in role allocations (especially accountability and notification/information responsibilities), which are essential in a RACI. The absence of “A” and “I,” and mismatches in “Responsible” and “Accountable” assignments, require a significant point deduction. For these reasons, the answer just meets a 7.0.
