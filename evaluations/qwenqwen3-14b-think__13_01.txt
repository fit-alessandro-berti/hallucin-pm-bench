The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data, with no hallucinations or unauthorized inferences. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: (1) Q3 phrasing is equivalent but not verbatim ("Case A1002 only" vs. "Only case A1002 contains"); (2) Q4 elaborations for small sample size lack the ground truth's precise variance example (±5.56 pp.), and temporal bias omits "morning" specificity (though the log spans into afternoon, the single-day point holds); (3) Q2 uses "/" instead of "÷" in calculation notation. These are trivial but warrant slight strict penalty per instructions.
