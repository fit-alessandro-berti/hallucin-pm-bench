**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added: `check_vip`, `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway: `gw_valid` exclusive to inclusive), with no extras or misses, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major deductions for format/presentation differences** (significant loss per instructions):
  - Headings use `##` (H2 markdown) instead of `**bold**` as in ground truth (-1.5).
  - List bullets use `-` instead of `*` (-0.5).
  - Task listings use verbose full XML elements (e.g., `<task id="check_vip" name="..."/>`) instead of concise "Name (id = `id`)" format (-2.0).
  - Gateway change uses full XML tags with redundant `id`/`name` instead of concise "**exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)" (-1.0).
  - Lacks `(v1)`/`(v2)` labels and final note "*(No other differences should be reported.)*" (-0.5).

- **Small error in XML fidelity** (significant loss): Omitted extra whitespace in v2 XML for `check_vip` (`id="check_vip"   name=...` → `id="check_vip" name=...`) and likely `generate_qr`, violating "exactly as they appear" (-0.5).

Base 10.0 → deductions total -6.0 = 5.0 (facts perfect, but presentation/XML precision deviates substantially from ground truth and prompt intent for exact, non-speculative listing).
