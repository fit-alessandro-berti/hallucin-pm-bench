9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Core Correctness (High Match, 10/10)**: Both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed and explain due to missing timestamps/durations. LLM adheres perfectly to system policy ("cannot be derived").
- **Phrasing & Structure (Minor Differences, -0.4)**: LLM uses "cannot be derived" (exact system phrasing) vs. ground truth's "cannot be computed"; bolding and structure similar but not identical. LLM directly answers Q1 then explains Q2; ground truth integrates.
- **Explanation Detail & Accuracy (Very Close, 9.5/10; -0.3 total)**: Both cite lack of time data. LLM accurately notes "chronological order" (implied by log sequence) and correctly dismisses benchmarks (bonus precision, not in ground truth). Ground truth claims "lacks ... ordering information" (slight overstatement, as sequence per case exists); LLM avoids this error. LLM specifies "start and end times for each occurrence" (precise for cycle time); ground truth's "temporal value per event" is vaguer but equivalent. LLM slightly longer/more comprehensive.
- **Strictness Penalty (-0.1)**: No fabrication; no use of irrelevant data. Minor wording variances (e.g., "requested value" vs. full question quote; "impossible" vs. "fabricated") deduct minimally but noticeably per instructions.

Overall: Extremely close (95%+ semantic/functional overlap); deductions only for non-identical phrasing/detail despite utmost strictness.
