The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without forbidden terms, and it includes the right activities as rows and roles as columns with no extras. However, the RACI assignments deviate substantially from the ground truth and the underlying process narrative in nearly every cell: multiple rows lack exact one Responsible per activity (e.g., extras or misses), Accountable assignments are misplaced (e.g., Compliance Officer as Accountable for KYC Review instead of Account Manager), and Consulted/Informed roles are frequently incorrect or omitted (e.g., Finance Clerk as "-" instead of "I" or "C" in several places). These errors—small in isolation but pervasive and core to RACI accuracy—warrant severe deductions under strict evaluation criteria. Minor formatting differences (e.g., "R, A" vs. "R / A", added title/legend) are negligible compared to content flaws.
