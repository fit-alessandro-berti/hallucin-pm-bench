6.0

**Rationale:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer consistently uses the correct, mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct spelling and capitalization. The forbidden terms never appear.
- No extra activities or roles; structure aligns with the prompt requirements.

**Errors and Penalties:**

*1. RACI assignment mismatches (major errors):*
- The Responsible (R) and Accountable (A) assignments do not always reflect the ground truth—in several activities, both are assigned together (e.g., “R, A”), whereas in the ground truth, certain activities distinctly assign “R” and “A” to separate roles (not always combined). The answer sometimes conflates these, which can lead to confusion about primary ownership.
- Significant mismatches in role assignment per activity, e.g.:
  - "Receive Application": Ground truth — AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I); LLM — AM (R,A), CO (I), FC (-), IT (-).
  - "KYC Review": Ground truth — CO (R), AM (A), FC (C), IT (I); LLM — CO (R,A), AM (I), FC (-), IT (C).
  - "Order Vetting": Ground truth — AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I); LLM — AM (R,A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (-).
  - Repeatedly roles are marked as uninvolved ("-") when the ground truth calls for their consultation or information.
  - For “Payment Clearance,” FC (Finance Clerk) should be **R**, with AM as A and other roles as C/I, but the LLM answer gives FC (R,A) and IT as C, omitting the others.
  - "Record Update": In the ground truth, IT is the only R, but others are C or I; the LLM answer only marks IT (R,A), others as I/-.

*2. "R/A" vs. "R, A":*  
- The ground truth uses “R / A” to indicate both Responsible and Accountable are assigned to the same role, which is a standard convention. The LLM answer uses “R, A” (comma), which is a minor notational variance but less preferable.  
- More importantly, in several activities, the ground truth assigns only R or A, not both, whereas the LLM answer assigns both R and A together everywhere (except where omitted).

*3. "Consulted" and "Informed" misallocation (moderate errors):*
- The ground truth allocates C and I widely; the LLM answer often omits “C” or “I” where the ground truth specifies them, or allocates “C”/“I” to the wrong roles (e.g., “Notify Customer” gives IT as Consulted, not Informed).

*4. Presentation:*
- The legend and table formatting are clear, but the departures from the ground truth allocation are the major source of lost points.

---

**Summary:**  
Terminology is perfect (no lost points for wording). Major deduction (~3-4 points) for incorrect/omitted RACI role allocations compared to ground truth. Minor deduction for “R, A” vs “R / A” formatting and some C/I misplacements. Hence, 6.0.
