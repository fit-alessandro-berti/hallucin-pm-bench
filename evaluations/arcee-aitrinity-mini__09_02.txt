The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in reasoning and conclusion (no timestamps prevent cycle time calculation), correctly identifies the core issue, and remains concise while using only provided info. Minor deductions for: (1) two sentences instead of one (violates "one concise sentence"); (2) unnecessary repetition of exact count "148,371"; (3) added phrasing like "frequency counts of start and complete events" and "individual instances" (expands beyond ground truth minimalism); (4) bolding not present in ground truth. No factual errors.
