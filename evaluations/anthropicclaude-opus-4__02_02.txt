**Score: 9.0**

**Evaluation:**

- **Q1 (Distinct cases):** Correct. LLM answer = "3", matches ground truth.
- **Q2 (C002 activity sequence):** Correct. LLM answer = "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order", matches ground truth in content and order.
- **Q3 (Distinct activity immediately preceding “Ship_Order”):** LLM gives:
  - Arrange_Delivery
  - Check_Stock
- **Formatting:** The LLM omits the underscores in activity names ("Arrange_Delivery" vs "Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock" vs "Check_Stock"), which is a minor but relevant deviation. The question specifically requests underscores, matching the event log values.

**Justification for Score:**
- All content is factually correct: NO missing, extra, or incorrect activity or case.
- Minor error: The activity names in Q3 are missing underscores, which is inconsistent with the literal log attribute values and the prompt's explicit instruction.
- All answers are in correct order and include no fabrications/omissions.

**Penalty assessment:**  
- Per instructions, even small errors (such as formatting) should reflect in significant point loss. The answer is otherwise perfect, so a deduction of 1.0 for the missing underscores is appropriate.

**Final Score:** 9.0
