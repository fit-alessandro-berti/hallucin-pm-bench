The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content for all questions: Q1 is correct (3 cases); Q2 sequences the activities identically; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) one per line in alphabetical order. The introductory organization of events by case is helpful context but does not introduce errors, hallucinations, or deviations. No penalties apply under strict evaluation.
