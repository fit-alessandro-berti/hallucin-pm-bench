4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (activities and numbers)**: Partial credit. #1 (Request_Documents) is correct with exact times (36.5h avg, 120.0h p95). However, #2 and #3 are incorrect: LLM ranks Initial_Screening (2.1h avg, only 3rd worst by avg waiting time) as #2 and Send_Closure_Letter (actual #2 at 12.2h) as #3, omitting the true #3 (Assess_Liability at 7.8h). This violates the prompt's "strictly by waiting-time" ranking (using Avg_Waiting_h). Numbers for listed activities match the table, but wrong selection drags this down significantly. (-4 points)
- **No unwarranted content**: Strong. No mentions of service-time, throughput, or unlisted activities. Memo stays focused on waiting times only. (+2 points)
- **Action relevance**: Moderate. Each recommendation is concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for delays), and the memo claims ≥20% reduction. However, actions lack explicit "data-driven" support (e.g., no pilots, estimates, or table-derived evidence like ground truth's "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%"). LLM invents projections without backing, and applies them to wrong activities. (-2 points)
- **Format and constraints**: Good structure as a professional memo (<150 words, ~140). Ranks clearly (#1–#3) and quotes both metrics verbatim. But extraneous closing question ("Would you like...") breaks the "draft the memo now" instruction. Ground truth is more concise/bullet-style, but prompt allows memo format. (-0.5 points)

Overall, the core error in activity ranking (misidentifying 2/3 worst activities) is a critical failure against the prompt and ground truth, warranting strict deduction despite solid formatting and no extraneous metrics.
