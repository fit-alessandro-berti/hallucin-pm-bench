### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth):
- **Vocabulary Policy (STRICT adherence, +2.0 partial credit)**: Perfect – uses exact "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance" (all three appear); no forbidden terms. Matches GT bolding intent implicitly.
- **Matrix Structure (+0.5 partial)**: Correct rows (6 activities), correct columns/roles (no extras), RACI key provided (though unused beyond R). But abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) vs. GT full names; extra header/notes/roles legend not in GT (unwarranted content, -0.5).
- **RACI Allocations (major failures, -4.8 penalty)**: 
  - Responsible (R) positions match GT exactly (one per row, correct roles: AM x3, CO, FC, IT).
  - But GT's **R/A** combos for AM activities shown as plain "R" (3 errors).
  - All other cells catastrophically wrong: LLM uses "-" (implying no involvement) vs. GT's **A/C/I** (e.g., Receive Application: CO=C/FC=I/IT=I missed; affects ~75% of 24 cells). Fails "reflect narrative" per rubric (GT infers consultations/informs; LLM ignores).
  - No bolding on key R cells as in GT.
- **Formatting/Completeness (-1.0)**: Extra text (header, key, roles list) violates "no unwarranted content". Table styling minor diff (e.g., **Activity** bold).
- **Overall Strictness**: ~20-25% match (terms + Rs only); massive differences in cell content/formatting justify low score. Small errors (abbrevs, no bold, R vs R/A) deduct further per instructions.
