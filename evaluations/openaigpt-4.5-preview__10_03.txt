6.0

The LLM answer demonstrates awareness of the required activity vocabulary and correctly uses the mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring). There are no disallowed synonyms present, which aligns with policy.

However, several significant deviations from the ground truth answer warrant a large penalty:

1. **Activity List**:  
   - The LLM adds extra activities not in the ground truth ("Analyst Notification," "Payment Scheduling," and splits "Funds Release" into "Funds Release" and "Payment Scheduling"), which is not explicitly authorized by the prompt.
   - The LLM renames "Release Funds" as "Funds Release," which is minor, but additional activities/renamings violate strictness.

2. **RACI Assignments**:  
   - The LLM incorrectly gives both Responsible and Accountable roles (R/A) to a single role in every line, which is not always accurate per the ground truth.
   - For "Intake Vetting," the Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer are marked as Informed, instead of the ground truth's Consulted and no involvement (–), respectively.
   - For "Risk Scoring," the ground truth splits R (Compliance Analyst) and A (Compliance Officer), but the LLM gives both R/A to the Compliance Analyst, with the Officer only Consulted.
   - For "Compliance Officer Approval," Treasury Ops is marked as Informed (I) instead of dash (–).
   - The roles of Consulted/Informed differ from ground truth in several cells throughout.

3. **Formatting**:  
   - The ground truth uses "R, A" for both roles, while the LLM uses "R/A"; this is a minor difference, but still a policy deviation.

4. **Activity Names**:  
   - The LLM correctly uses mandated vocabulary for the main activities, but the inclusion of unauthorized activity names ("Analyst Notification," "Payment Scheduling") disrupts process fidelity.

**Summary**:  
The answer avoids forbidden vocabulary and uses the mandated terms for the four key activities. However, unauthorized activity additions, incorrect RACI assignments, and deviations from the expected format result in substantial deductions. According to the demanded "utmost strictness," the answer deserves a 6.0.
