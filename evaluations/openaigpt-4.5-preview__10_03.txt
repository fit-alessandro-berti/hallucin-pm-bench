The LLM answer demonstrates correct adherence to the vocabulary policy by using only the mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without any disallowed synonyms leaking in. However, it incurs significant penalties for multiple deviations from the ground truth, evaluated with strictness as instructed:

- **Extra and renamed activities**: The LLM adds unauthorized rows ("Payment Scheduling" and "Analyst Notification") and renames/splits "Release Funds" into "Funds Release" and "Payment Scheduling," violating the instruction to "not rename, merge, or add activities." The ground truth consolidates into six precise activities, while the LLM expands to eight, introducing unsubstantiated granularity.
  
- **RACI assignment errors**: Numerous mismatches across rows, including:
  - Intake Vetting: Compliance Analyst (C vs. I), Compliance Officer (– vs. I).
  - KYC Review and AML Screening: Front-Office Analyst (– vs. I).
  - Risk Scoring: Front-Office Analyst (C vs. I), Compliance Analyst (R vs. R/A), Compliance Officer (A vs. C) – a critical error in splitting responsibilities.
  - Compliance Officer Approval: Treasury Ops (– vs. I).
  - Release Funds (equivalent row): Compliance Analyst (C vs. I), Compliance Officer (C vs. I).
  These affect over 50% of cells, with no involvement marked incorrectly (e.g., dashes ignored).

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses "R/A" instead of "R, A" or separate entries; inconsistent bolding (all R/A cells bolded vs. ground truth's targeted bolding on activities and primary R/A cells); minor header and activity name variations (e.g., no bold on activities, spacing issues).

- **Overall coverage**: While it attempts to cover roles and activities, the additions and errors distort the matrix, failing to match the ground truth's precise structure and RACI logic derived from the narrative. Small errors (e.g., "I" vs. "–") compound to major inaccuracies, warranting substantial point loss.
