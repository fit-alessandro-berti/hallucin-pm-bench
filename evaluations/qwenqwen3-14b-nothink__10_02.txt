3.0

The LLM answer shows significant divergence from the ground truth, meriting a low score. Issues include:

**Major Errors:**
1. **RACI Structure Errors:**
   - The LLM output does not properly use the canonical RACI columns (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed). Instead, “Accountable” is missing entirely as a column, and “Consulted” and “Informed” contain mixed and misunderstood usages (e.g., simply putting a checkmark where a role should be specified).
   - The ground truth clearly identifies the RACI assignment for every actor and task per the mandated format.

2. **Incomplete Roles:**
   - The LLM answer omits the **IT Support** and **Operations Manager** columns, both of which are present in the ground truth and participate in several activities. This is a major structural omission.
   - Furthermore, the answer fails to mention **Accountable** actors for any task.

3. **Incorrect Vocabulary Use:**
   - While the answer sticks mostly to the mandated terms (“Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “KYC Review”), it presents a “Performs KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary” task, which closely mirrors source text rather than the abstracted “KYC Review” as per the ground truth.
   - Additionally, the task descriptions are not consistently mapped to the mandated terms.

4. **Task List Mapping:**
   - The LLM answer fails to abstract/process names properly (e.g., “Receives the customer’s transfer instruction and logs it in the system” instead of “Receive Payment Instruction”).
   - The answer splits IT Support activities into “Ensures the SWIFT message is sent” and “Archives the case file,” neither of which is mapped to the ground truth’s task abstractions (e.g., “Archive Record”).
   - It introduces “Notified of the case file archive” as its own row, which is not in the ground truth.

5. **Other Deficiencies:**
   - No legend or explanation for R, A, C, I marks, and inconsistent use of checkmarks.
   - Lacks the exact vocabulary and precision required by the instructions, especially around the activities’ names.

**Minor Lapses:**
- Markdown formatting is present but does not follow the explicit structure required in the ground truth.

Due to these cumulative errors—particularly the lack of an Accountable column, the omission of mandated roles, and inconsistent, non-mandated task names—a score of **3.0** is justified.
