The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, notation, role coverage, and task mapping, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key failures include: (1) Non-standard RACI notation using âœ… instead of explicit R/A/C/I with bolding and a legend; (2) Incomplete columns, with only two mandated roles plus generic "Consulted" and "Informed" that fail to specify assignees (e.g., no dedicated IT Support column, dumping IT tasks vaguely into "Informed"); (3) Addition of an extraneous row ("Notified of the case file archive") not present in the source or ground truth; (4) Separation of source step 5 into mismatched tasks (e.g., "Ensures the SWIFT message is sent" incorrectly placed under generic "Informed" rather than integrated into "Release Payment" with proper role assignments); (5) Incomplete accountability mapping (e.g., ground truth consistently assigns "Operations Manager" as A across tasks, which the LLM omits entirely, and IT Support's R for archiving is unaddressed properly); (6) Minor wording variances (e.g., "Performs KYC Review" vs. ground truth's concise "**KYC Review**" with mandated bolding); and (7) Absence of a legend and failure to "organise the RACI matrix clearly" per the prompt. While it uses mandated terms like "KYC Review" and roles where applicable and covers most source steps in Markdown, these structural and substantive errors dominate, reflecting only partial adherence.
