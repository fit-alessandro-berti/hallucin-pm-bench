The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in core content: correct "yes" conclusion, identical shortest firing sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3), valid step-by-step marking explanations, and sound reasoning for feasibility (use of T2b shortcut to bypass T3 for pd, T4 for pe, T6 feedback to enable T3 post-T5). The shortness argument matches the ground truth's lower bound (4 steps to fire T5 without T3, plus 2 more for T3 after), emphasizing necessity of each transition without factual errors.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for slight phrasing awkwardness (e.g., the conditional "T5 cannot fire before T3 only if..." is logically correct but less concise/clear than ground truth's direct explanation) and added verbosity/repetition (e.g., restating the sequence at the end, fuller markings vs. ground truth's abbreviated style), which introduce small stylistic differences without impacting correctness. No significant errors, but strict evaluation penalizes non-identical presentation.
