**8.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1-Q4**: Exact match to ground truth → Full credit (no deduction).
- **Q5**: Partial match. Correctly identifies 3 activities (`Validate_Order`, `Pack_Items`, `Ship_Order`) that never appear as first events. However, incorrectly includes `"Quality_Check"` (appears as first event in case `C-77`). This is a factual error (misreading case starts), resulting in wrong list length/content. Under utmost strictness, significant deduction (-2.0 total) for this key deviation, despite near-match.

**Overall**: High fidelity (80%+ exact), but non-trivial error in analysis prevents perfect score. Minor order differences ignored as schema allows unsorted.
