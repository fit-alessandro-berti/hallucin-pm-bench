The LLM answer fully aligns with the ground truth by correctly stating that the value cannot be derived/computed, providing a clear and accurate explanation focused on the absence of timestamps/durations, and emphasizing that benchmarks do not apply (which is implied in the ground truth's rejection of fabrication). No substantive differences exist; minor phrasing variations (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed," "Explanation" vs. "**Reasoning:**") do not impact correctness or completeness under strict evaluation.
