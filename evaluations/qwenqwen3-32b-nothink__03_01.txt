3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer attempts to model the process but introduces critical errors in flow and fidelity to the description/ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences:

- **Major Flow Error (Fatal Deviation, -4.0 points)**: The "Password Reset" path (t2: "Provide Reset Instructions") incorrectly flows to t5 ("Forward to Specialist") via f5, then to t4 ("Resolve Issue"), before reaching t6 ("Confirm with Customer"). The description (line 3) states it "goes straight to 'Provide Reset Instructions'", implying direct resolution to confirmation (line 7), without forwarding or additional resolution. Ground truth correctly connects t2 directly to t6 (f5). This misroutes adds unmentioned steps, violating "exactly as stated" and "do not invent or add" activities/gateways.

- **Decision Modeling Inaccuracies (-1.5 points)**: Uses three exclusive gateways (correct need, despite prompt mentioning "two"), but gw2 lacks a name (ground: "Resolved Internally?") and gw3 lacks a name (ground: "Customer Confirms?"). gw1 also unnamed (ground: "Password Reset?"). Conditions use verbose XPath expressions (e.g., `ticket/classification = 'Password Reset'`) instead of ground truth's concise "yes"/"no", adding unnecessary complexity not prompted.

- **Naming Inconsistencies (-0.8 points)**: 
  - Start event: "Customer submits ticket" vs. ground's "Ticket Submitted" (line 1 mismatch).
  - Classification task: "Classify ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification" (line 2 omits "automatically by the system").
  - Minor: End event "Ticket Closed" matches, but overall names deviate slightly from exact phrasing.

- **Structural/Compliance Issues (-0.5 points)**: Missing ground truth elements like `<?xml version?>`, `targetNamespace`, process `name="Support-Ticket"`, and `isExecutable="false"` (though prompt allows minimal <definitions>, these affect XML validity/completeness). IDs are concise (e.g., t1, gw1) and output <40 lines, which is positive but insufficient to offset errors. No invented elements (e.g., no timers/SLAs), and loop (gw3 no → t3 via f13) matches line 9/ground truth.

- **Positives (Partial Credit)**: Correctly models non-password path (t3 → gw2 → t4/t5 → t4 → t6), specialist resolution (t5 → t4 per line 6), and closure (gw3 yes → e1). Uses exclusive gateways for decisions and sequence flows appropriately.

Overall, the model captures ~60% of the structure but fails on a core branch (password reset), leading to significant differences from ground truth. Strict scoring reflects this as a fundamentally inaccurate translation.
