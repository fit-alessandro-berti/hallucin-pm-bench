The LLM answer is fully accurate and deterministic for questions 1 and 2, correctly identifying the single occurrence, event/case counts, and percentages with proper rounding. For question 3, the explanation is concise (â‰¤100 words), cautions against over-generalization (e.g., misrepresenting performance, inaccurate predictions), and addresses low-support risks (infrequency leading to skew or omission of rare routes). However, it deducts points for not explicitly mentioning the "single-occurrence" issue or variance/instability (e.g., noise from one observation skewing statistics), remaining somewhat generic rather than tying directly to the excerpt's sparsity as required.
