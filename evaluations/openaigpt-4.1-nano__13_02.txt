**9.5**

**Evaluation:**

1. **Question 1:** Answer is correct ("1").  
2. **Question 2:**  
   a) Correct, 2.08% (to two decimals).  
   b) Correct, 8.33% (to two decimals).  
3. **Explanation:**  
   - The answer mentions “appears infrequently,” “overemphasizing importance,” mentions “sparse data,” “misrepresenting overall process performance,” and “predicting outcomes inaccurately,” warning about "mismanagement or misguided improvement."  
   - However, it does not explicitly mention (i) "single occurrence", (ii) sample variance/instability, or (iii) confidence in statistics—in other words, it lacks explicit reference to very high variance/instability (“rests on a single observation,” “skew averages,” “confidence intervals remain wide,” etc., as required by the rubric).

**Summary:**  
All numbers are perfectly correct. The explanation identifies the core pitfall (overgeneralisation, risk), but lacks explicit language about the statistical unreliability and the dangers of drawing any kind of generalisation from a single instance. This omission, while not catastrophic, is a notable detail as per the strict marking guide.

**Final score:** 9.5/10 (tiny deduction for not highlighting the single-instance/statistical instability aspect explicitly in the explanation).
