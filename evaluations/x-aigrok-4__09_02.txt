The LLM answer correctly identifies the core issue (lack of timestamp information preventing cycle time calculation) in a single concise sentence as required, but it loses points for being less precise and explanatory than the ground truth: it omits explicit references to the absence of duration data, the presence of only event counts, and the specific need for start-to-completion intervals, which provide fuller reasoning for why computation is impossible.
