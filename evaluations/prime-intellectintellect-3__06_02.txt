8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact three concurrent task sets from Process B, matching the ground truth content verbatim in the numbered lines (including task names, order, commas, and spacing). No incorrect tasks are included, and no tasks from Processes A or C are mentioned.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Adds an unrequested introductory sentence.
- Uses unnecessary bolding on the process name.
- Appends an entire "**Explanation**" section (4 bullets) that restates the blocks and explicitly lists sequential tasks (`Accept_Custom_Order`, etc.), violating the "Return your answer as numbered lines" instruction by not being purely the enumerated list. The prompt's "exclude any tasks that must run sequentially" implies not referencing them at all in the response.
These format/excess content deviations are small but non-trivial errors, warranting a significant deduction from 10.0 despite perfect core accuracy.
