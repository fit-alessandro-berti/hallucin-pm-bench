9.0

The LLM answer accurately identifies all required changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive), matching the core content of the ground truth without omissions or additions. However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.0 point for minor differences: unnumbered lists (vs. numbered), lack of bolding/backticks on task names/IDs, slightly imprecise gateway wording (omits version references "v1" and "v2," and acronyms "(XOR)" and "(OR)"), and no escaped underscore in the gateway ID. These are small formatting/content variances but warrant the deduction per instructions.
