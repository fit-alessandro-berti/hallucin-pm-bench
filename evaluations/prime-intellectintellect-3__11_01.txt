The LLM answer excels in correctness (exact activities ranked by avg waiting time, verbatim numbers quoted with both metrics), no unwarranted content (no service times, throughput, or extra activities), and memo format under 150 words (~80). Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting times (e.g., automation for docs delay, batch-to-real-time for closure, parallel for assessment queues), and promise ≥20% cuts without fabricating data like "pilots."

Deductions (-0.8 total): 
- Action details/phrasing differ substantially from ground truth (e.g., "automated request system" vs "customer reminders with pilots"; softer "targeting >20%" vs definite "≥25% cut"), reducing verbatim similarity.
- Minor phrasing inconsistencies (e.g., "36.5h avg / 120h 95p" vs "avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h"; added intro/header).
Strict but not perfect match.
