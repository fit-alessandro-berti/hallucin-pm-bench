The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: three added tasks, one removed task, and two gateway type changes, with exact IDs, names, and change descriptions matching the ground truth and prompt specifications. No extra or missing differences, no commentary, only required headings verbatim.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for small formatting errors under utmost strictness:
- Extra blank lines after each heading (3 instances).
- Lack of alignment spaces in "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" (missing ~5 spaces after ":" to match ground truth columnar alignment).
- Minor inconsistent whitespace after bullets (extra spaces/newlines).

These are non-functional whitespace differences but result in non-identical output strings vs. ground truth.
