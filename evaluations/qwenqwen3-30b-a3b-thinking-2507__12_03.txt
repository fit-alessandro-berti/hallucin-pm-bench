9.0

The LLM answer is clear, correct, and directly references both Case C002 and Case C004—in perfect alignment with the ground truth answer. The justification is fully accurate, names the relevant CaseIDs, and clearly states the intervening activities. However, there are minor gaps that separate it from a perfect score:

- The LLM does not format its answer in a table as the ground truth does, nor does it perform a true case-by-case enumeration—C001 and C003 are only briefly mentioned, not explicitly listed/sequenced.
- It doesn't make explicit the count of violations as “two out of four cases”, though it does make it clear in words.

These minor presentational and completeness differences account for a 1-point deduction.
