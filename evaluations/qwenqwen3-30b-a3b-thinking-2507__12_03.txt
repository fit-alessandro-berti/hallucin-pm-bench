The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering "No" and providing a precise justification that identifies the same violations (C002 and C004) with exact sequences and intervening activities, while noting compliance in C001 and C003. The use of "always" is properly addressed as the key failure point. Minor deduction for not using the ground truth's structured table format (narrative vs. tabular), which slightly reduces exhaustive case-by-case visibility despite equivalent content and no factual errors.
