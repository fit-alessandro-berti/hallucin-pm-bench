### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (major deduction: 20/30 points)**: The LLM correctly identifies the three actual added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject) but incorrectly includes Task_ApproveLoan as "added" with a nonsensical note about it being renamed from itself. This violates the instruction to ignore cosmetic renamings (the task exists in both versions; only its name changed). Introducing a false addition is a significant error, as it misrepresents the changes and contradicts the ground truth's explicit note of "no other additions."
  
- **Removed tasks (full points: 30/30)**: Correctly identifies only Task_RejectLoan, matching the ground truth exactly.

- **Gateway-type changes (partial deduction: 25/30 points)**: Accurately notes the change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision, but omits the explanatory terms "exclusive (XOR)" and "inclusive (OR)" used in the ground truth, and uses less precise phrasing without specifying versions (v1 to v2).

- **Overall structure and strictness (deduction: 5/10 points)**: The response uses a non-matching format (bullets vs. numbered lists; includes unrequested header and company/process name). It fails to strictly adhere to "summarise *all* changes" without extras, and the erroneous addition inflates the summary incorrectly. Minor issues like inconsistent naming (task IDs only vs. names + IDs) compound the strictness penalty.

Total differences (factual error + incomplete precision + formatting mismatches) warrant a low-mid score, emphasizing strict evaluation of even small-to-medium deviations.
