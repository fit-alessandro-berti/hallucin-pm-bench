### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core correctness (high match, no major errors):** Both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed due to missing timestamps/durations. LLM precisely identifies the need for "two timestamps per activity instance (start/end) or pre-computed elapsed-time," aligning closely with GT's emphasis on lacking "timestamps, durations." Score boost for accuracy.
- **Minor wording/structure differences (small deduction):** "Calculated" vs. "computed"; LLM uses markdown headers/table (helpful but not in GT's blockquote format); extra "why benchmark cannot substitute" section is accurate/proactive (per system policy) but absent in GT and exceeds "briefly explain" – verbose for strict brevity.
- **Additional strengths (boost):** LLM explicitly lists available fields (✅/❌ table), dismisses benchmark logically (not listed, different segment), reinforces redaction quote – enhances clarity without fabrication.
- **Strictness applied:** -0.8 for non-brief elaboration (table, subsections, conclusion repeat) and format divergence; no significant errors, so not lower. Semantic overlap ~95%.
