**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correctness of "Yes" and key insight (shortcut via T2b)**: Matches ground truth (+2.0 points). Both identify T2b bypasses pc/T3 for pd.
- **Firing sequence**: Major mismatch (-4.0). LLM provides ⟨T1, T2b, T4, T5⟩ (stops at T5, T3 never fires). Ground truth requires full demonstration of **ordering** (T5 *before* T3, both firing): ⟨T1, T2b, T4, T5, **T6, T3**⟩. LLM sequence proves T5 *without* prior T3 but fails to show T3 *after* T5 (requires T6 feedback for pc), missing the complete proof of possible ordering. Boxed sequence differs entirely.
- **Shortest sequence claim**: Error (-1.5). LLM wrongly claims 4 is minimal (for T5 only). Ground truth correctly notes 4 for T5 prefix but 6 total minimal for T5-before-T3 ordering (T1 + branch + T4 + T5 + T6 + T3; explains T6 necessity post-pd consumption).
- **Explanation & verification**: Partial match (-0.5). LLM correctly verifies prefix but asserts "T3 never enabled/fired before T5" without addressing post-T5 (ignores T6 loop, net's key feature). Ground truth explicitly proves "T3 can still fire *after* T5, satisfying ordering" with markings and lower bound.
- **Structure/extras**: LLM table/markers nice but irrelevant to mismatch; no deduction but no gain.

Total differences substantial (wrong core sequence, incomplete ordering proof, erroneous minimality). Strict per instructions: 4.0 (partial credit for prefix/insight; heavy penalty for deviations).
