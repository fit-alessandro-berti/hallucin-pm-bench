The LLM answer is highly accurate with no factual errors, hallucinations, or missing elements. Content matches the ground truth precisely across all questions (distinct cases: 3; C002 sequence identical; Q3 predecessors correctly identified as Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock, alphabetically ordered). Minor deductions for small formatting/style differences: (1) extra listing of case IDs in Q1 (not in ground truth); (2) added header phrasing and lack of bullet dashes in Q3 (prompt specifies "one per line" but ground truth uses dashes; backticks in Q2 are unnecessary but harmless). These are non-substantive extras, but per strict criteria, they warrant a slight point loss.
