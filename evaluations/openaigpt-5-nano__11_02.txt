7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities as the ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), which align with the table's clear bottlenecks in wait times, processing times, rework rates, and SLA breaches. Explanations are mostly data-driven and table-strict for Request_Documents (150 min wait, 22% rework, 5.5% SLA) and Review_Documents (25 min processing, 30 min wait, 9 min stdev, 5.3% rework, 12.4% SLA). Recommendations are concrete and actionable, with measurable targets (e.g., wait ≤60 min, rework ≤8%), adding value beyond the ground truth's suggestions.

However, strict deductions apply for:
- **Factual inaccuracy (significant penalty, -1.5 points)**: For Initial_Assessment, it incorrectly labels the 18 min wait as "second-highest," ignoring Review_Documents' higher 30 min wait—violating "based strictly on the table" and introducing a clear error not excused by ambiguity.
- **Incomplete under-performance analysis (-0.5 points)**: Omits throughput drop (e.g., to 190 cases/day for Request_Documents, emphasized in ground truth), a key table metric for "why" they under-perform.
- **Structural and completeness gaps (-0.5 points)**: Lacks memo format with intro/conclusion (e.g., no executive summary or projected benefits like ground truth's ≈10% throughput lift and >40% SLA reduction); presents as a list under "Executive snapshot," deviating from "executive memo" style.
- Word count is compliant (≈180 words), and no hallucinations or extraneous activities.

Overall, strong alignment on core task elements but undermined by the error and polish differences, warranting a mid-high score under utmost strictness.
