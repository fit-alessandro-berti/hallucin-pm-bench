9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict assessment):
- **Q1 (10/10)**: Exact match (`1` occurrence).
- **Q2 (9/10)**: Correct value and calculation (5.56%), but minor formatting difference (no space before `%`; simple fraction vs. mathematical notation `$1 ÷ 18 × 100 = 5.56$ %`), deducting 1 point for non-identical presentation under strictness.
- **Q3 (9/10)**: Correct identifier (**A1002**), but lacks the fuller confirmatory phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”"), making it concise but not identically ideal; deduct 1 point.
- **Q4 (9/10)**: Selects and clearly states two valid reasons matching GT examples (**small sample size**, **temporal bias**), with accurate log-derived details (18 events, 4 cases, ~5-hour span). Minor deductions for slight over-elaboration/unjustified inferences ("seasonal variations" – imprecise for monthly context; "peak shopping hours, or on weekends" – assumes unlisted business patterns), revealing tiny deviation from "directly derived" criterion.

**Overall**: 92% match (minor phrasing/formatting/inference differences compound under "significant loss for small errors," but no major hallucinations or factual errors).
