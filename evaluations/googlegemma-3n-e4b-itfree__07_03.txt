3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **ADDED TASKS**: Correctly identifies the three added tasks by ID, but fails to include names in parentheses as required (e.g., should be "Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)"). Lists them without bullets or proper structure, violating the expected format. This is a significant formatting and content omission (-2.5 points).
- **REMOVED TASKS**: Correctly identifies the one removed task by ID, but omits the name in parentheses (should be "Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)"). Lacks bullet formatting (-1.5 points).
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: Misses the second change (Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel), detecting only one of two verifiable differences—this is a major factual omission (-3.0 points). Uses incorrect formatting with extraneous asterisks and guillemets (*«exclusive → parallel»*), deviating from the example ("Gateway_X: exclusive → parallel") and ground truth (no guillemets, bulleted with dash). No bullets (-1.0 point).
- **Overall Structure**: Uses bold headings instead of verbatim plain text; lacks bullets/dashes throughout, adding no commentary as required but failing strict format adherence. With utmost strictness, multiple small-to-medium errors (missing names, extra symbols) compound with the critical gateway omission, resulting in a low score despite partial ID accuracy.
