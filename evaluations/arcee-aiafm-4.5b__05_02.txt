The LLM answer fails entirely by targeting the wrong task (first instead of the critical late-stage bottleneck), applying an illogical change (P0D worsens urgency without addressing cumulative delays, and "no due date" rationale contradicts SLA improvement goals), providing a flawed and non-compliant rationale that doesn't reference the implied 3-day SLA constraint, and using an incomplete unified diff format lacking @@ hunk headers, resulting in zero alignment with the ground truth.
