8.0

The LLM answer is almost perfect, but contains a small but meaningful error:

- Q1: Correct (3)
- Q2: Correct ("Pack_Items")
- Q3: Correct ("2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00")
- Q4: Correct (2)
- Q5: LLM answer incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as never appearing as a first event, but in the log "Quality_Check" is the first event of case "C-77" -- so "Quality_Check" should NOT be in the Q5 answer.

Due to this extra erroneous item in Q5, the answer is slightly off. According to the instructions, even small errors merit a notable deduction. Hence, I assigned 8.0 instead of a higher score.
