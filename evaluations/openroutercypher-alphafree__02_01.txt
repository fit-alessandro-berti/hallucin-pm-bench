### Evaluation
The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, demonstrating accurate extraction of distinct case IDs (3), preceding activity for Ship_Order in case A-9321 (Pack_Items), earliest timestamp (2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00), and count of Quality_Check occurrences (2 from cases B-1045 and C-77).

However, Q5 contains a significant error: the list includes "Quality_Check", which incorrectly appears despite being the first event in case C-77. The ground truth list is limited to activities that truly never start a case (Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Ship_Order). While the order is irrelevant per the schema and the correct three activities are present, the extraneous inclusion violates the question's precision requirement ("every activity that never appears as the first event of any case"). Under strict evaluation, this factual inaccuracy in one of five questions deducts substantial points, as it misrepresents the event log's structure. Overall, the answer is strong but flawed in completeness for Q5.
