The LLM answer is mostly accurate but contains a critical error in R2 (incorrectly marked Compliant with flawed justification, missing the impact of the post-change approval per R5), leading to an understated violation count. R5 justification is incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice). Other rules, format, and overall conclusion align well with ground truth, but strict evaluation deducts heavily for the R2 discrepancy and minor R5 gap.
