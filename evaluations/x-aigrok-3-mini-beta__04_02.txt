7.0

R1: Correct (Compliant, reasoning matches ground truth).
R2: Incorrect (LLM says Compliant; ground truth says Violated because Ship_Goods happened before new Manager_Approval, so not within 2 days of final approval).
R3: Correct (Violated, justified accurately).
R4: Correct (Not Applicable, hazardous is false).
R5: Partially correct (LLM identifies violation, but only mentions Ship_Goods, not Pay_Invoice before new approval).
R6: Correct (Compliant).

Summary: 
- R2 is a significant error: LLM does not consider the impact of Change_Request, so the approval window is wrong (major loss of points).
- R5 omits that both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before the new Manager_Approval (minor points off).
- All other items correct.

Strictness: The critical error in R2 (incorrect Compliant where itâ€™s actually Violated) justifies a heavy penalty. The R5 minor omission adds to the loss. Therefore, a 3-point deduction for R2, 0.5 point for R5, and rounding for strictness and precision yields a 7.0/10.
