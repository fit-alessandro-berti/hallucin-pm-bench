7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (3 items, with names and IDs matching ground truth) and the single removed task, earning full credit for those sections' core content. The gateway-type change is accurately described (Exclusive to Inclusive, with ID), though it omits the XOR/OR notation and version specificity from ground truth, which is a minor but notable gap given the prompt's example phrasing.

However, under "Removed Tasks," the LLM introduces an extraneous bullet point discussing a task name change ("Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan") and incorrectly categorizes it there, despite the prompt's explicit instruction to ignore cosmetic renamings and stick strictly to the three headings without extraneous details. This violates the "strictly" requirement and pollutes the section, warranting a significant deduction (2.5 points lost). No other changes (e.g., flows) are hallucinated or missed, but the structure uses inconsistent markdown (###/#### vs. ground truth's *bold* and numbering), adding a trivial formatting mismatch (-0.5 points).

Overall, the response is 75% aligned but undermined by the misplaced renaming mention, per the strict evaluation criteria.
