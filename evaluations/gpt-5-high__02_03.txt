- A1: The LLM answer "3" is correct, but lacks clarity compared to the ground truth's "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)", which explicitly lists the case names. The omission of the case names is a minor but meaningful departure, resulting in a penalty.
- A2: Correct.
- A3: Correct.

The essential information is present and correct in all responses, but minor strictness is warranted for the loss of specificity in A1.
