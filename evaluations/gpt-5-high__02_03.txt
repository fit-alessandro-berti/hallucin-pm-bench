The LLM answer is concise, correctly formatted as bullet points, and matches the ground truth content exactly: 3 distinct cases, "Pack_Items" precedes "Ship_Order" in C456, and "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once. The ground truth's additional details (e.g., listing cases in A1) are not required by the prompt's instruction for conciseness, so no deductions apply under strict evaluation.
