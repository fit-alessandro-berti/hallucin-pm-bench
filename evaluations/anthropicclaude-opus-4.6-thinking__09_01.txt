The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in substance: both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed due to missing timestamps/durations, and both explain why no calculation is possible. Strengths include direct adherence to the system instruction ("cannot be derived"), thorough reasoning (e.g., explicitly addressing the irrelevant benchmark, which the ground truth omits but is contextually relevant), and professional structure.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Stylistic differences: Extra formatting (## Answer, numbered list, Bottom line, bolding) and lengthier explanation vs. ground truth's concise, unnumbered "Reasoning:" block.
- Phrasing variations: "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; no explicit mention of "ordering information" or "fabricated" numeric risk, though implied.
- Does not restate the full question phrasing ("average cycle time of “Review Contract”") at the start, unlike ground truth.

No factual errors; stricter penalties not warranted as core message and logic are identical.
