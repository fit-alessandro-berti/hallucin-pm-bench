5.0

The LLM answer has a critical error in R2 (incorrectly marked Compliant instead of Violated, with flawed justification ignoring the post-change approval timing), which misrepresents compliance despite correct overall result. Minor differences in R5 justification are negligible, but the major discrepancy warrants substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria. All other rules align closely with ground truth.
