6.5

**Evaluation:**

- **R1**: CORRECT. Both the status and justification match ground truth.
- **R2**: INCORRECT. The LLM answer incorrectly marked this as "Compliant" based on the time after the *initial* approvals, not the required “last required approval” after a post-approval Change_Request. This is a critical misreading of the rule and event sequence; should be "Violated".
- **R3**: CORRECT. Marked "Violated", matches ground truth.
- **R4**: CORRECT. "Not Applicable", correct reasoning.
- **R5**: PARTLY CORRECT. Correctly marked "Violated", and generally correct justification, but less precise: ground truth specifies both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice were premature, but the LLM answer notes only Manager_Approval after Ship_Goods.
- **R6**: CORRECT. "Compliant", matches ground truth.
- **Overall result**: CORRECT.

**Point deductions**:
- Major mistake on R2 (critical rule violation misclassified): −2.0 points.
- Slight imprecision in R5 justification: −0.5 points.
- Otherwise, brevity and answer structure acceptable.

**Summary**: Mostly aligned but a severe error on R2, thus 6.5/10.
