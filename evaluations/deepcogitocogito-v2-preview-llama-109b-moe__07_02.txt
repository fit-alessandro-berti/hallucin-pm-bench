The LLM answer correctly identifies the key elements (added tasks including Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, and Final Reject; removed task as Reject Loan; gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive). However, it includes significant extraneous content: lengthy preliminary reasoning not under the required headings, which deviates from a strict summary format. Under added and removed tasks, it adds interpretive descriptions (e.g., "New verification step added at the beginning") not present in the ground truth, constituting unnecessary elaboration. Under gateway-type changes, it expands to two bullets with non-structural details (e.g., "allowing multiple concurrent paths" and "three-way decision"), misplacing functional/process changes under a heading strictly for type (e.g., XOR to OR) and omitting the gateway ID reference. It also ignores cosmetic aspects like name changes but doesn't format as concisely (e.g., no numbering, inconsistent style with ground truth). These deviations, even if minor in content, inflate differences and warrant a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
