7.5

**Rationale**: Q1 is identical (10/10). Q2 captures core idea of tiny/temporal sample biasing frequency estimates (e.g., 1/3 cases) and full-log contrast, staying under word limit and data-bound (8/10). Deductions for: factual error (15 vs. 14 events, -1); no statistical sampling variance/confidence interval emphasis (-0.5); omission of key synonyms/matching distortion risk (-1, major conceptual gap vs. GT). Minor: speculates "thousands" and "~33%" metric differs from GT's event-based swing. Strict but not zero for substantive overlap.
