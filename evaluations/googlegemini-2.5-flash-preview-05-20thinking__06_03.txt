9.5

The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth answer in terms of content and sequence. It correctly lists the two pairs of concurrent tasks that result from the two parallel blocks, and in the right order. The only minor shortcoming is very slight: the answer does not explicitly label the sets as "Set 1"/"Set 2" or reference "parallel block" as in the ground truth, and it omits the explicit note that "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." While these are minor formatting and exhaustiveness differences (and the note is arguably redundant given the directness of the answer), the strict grading requested means even these small deviations warrant a slight deduction. 

Thus, the answer is graded 9.5.
