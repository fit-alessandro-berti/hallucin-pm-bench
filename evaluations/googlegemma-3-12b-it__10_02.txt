3.0

- The LLM answer makes significant errors in both role mapping and RACI attributions compared to the ground truth.
- It omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely.
- It incorrectly assigns both "Responsible" and "Accountable" to the same person in nearly every activity, which violates proper RACI separation.
- For "KYC Review" and "Approve High-Risk Transaction," the LLM makes the "Transaction Analyst" responsible, where the ground truth has "Regulatory Liaison" as Responsible and Accountable (with Transaction Analyst only Consulted).
- Its "Release Payment" and "Send SWIFT Message" steps do not differentiate between Responsible and Accountable as in the ground truth.
- The LLM invents a "Notify of Case File Archival" activity not present in the ground truth.
- The sequence and terminology for activities aren’t as strictly aligned with the prompt as the ground truth, and sometimes activity titles are not precise.
- "Consulted" and "Informed" columns are sparsely and inaccurately filled compared to the detailed ground truth mapping.
- The required legend is missing.

Due to these errors—including role omission, RACI misattribution, lack of proper mapping, vocabulary slippage, and overall structural weaknesses—the answer shows a basic understanding but major failure in accuracy and rigor.
