### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without forbidden substitutions, mapping "payment clerk" to "Transaction Analyst" and "compliance officer" to "Regulatory Liaison". However, it does not emphasize "mandated wording" in task names as the ground truth does (e.g., bolding **KYC Review**), and introduces non-source elements like "Notify of Case File Archival" without strict alignment.
- **Task Coverage and Breakdown (significant deductions)**: The LLM covers most source steps but introduces extras (e.g., separate "Send SWIFT Message" and "Notify of Case File Archival") not distinctly present in the ground truth, which combines archiving/notification implicitly and omits SWIFT as a standalone task. Small naming differences (e.g., "Log Transfer Instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Approve High-Risk Transaction" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions") are minor but penalized strictly. Omissions include no explicit "Receive" step, leading to incomplete mapping of step 1.
- **RACI Assignments (major deductions)**: Core errors in responsibility/accountability. For "KYC Review" and "Approve High-Risk Transaction", the source assigns these to the compliance officer (Regulatory Liaison as R), but LLM incorrectly assigns Responsible to Transaction Analyst, with Liaison only as Accountableâ€”this mismatches the ground truth (Liaison as R, Operations Manager as A, Analyst as C). Sanctions screening has Analyst as both R and A (partial match to ground truth's R, but ground has Liaison as A). Release Payment partially aligns (Analyst R), but adds unwarranted Consulted for IT Support. Archiving aligns somewhat (IT R), but Notify is entirely misassigned (e.g., Informed should target Liaison per source, but LLM puts Analyst as I and Liaison as A). Blanks in Consulted/Informed columns ignore ground truth's detailed C/I assignments (e.g., IT as C/I in multiple rows). No Operations Manager role, a key ground truth column, leading to incomplete role coverage.
- **Table Structure and Format (moderate deductions)**: Markdown table is provided, but uses a traditional RACI-column format vs. ground truth's transposed role-columns with bolded letters (R/A/C/I). This is a valid RACI but deviates from the ground truth's exact presentation. Extra "Explanation of Roles" section is unrequested and not in ground truth, adding bloat.
- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness**: While the LLM attempts a complete process map and avoids criminal/illicit content, differences in assignments (especially for compliance-critical tasks like KYC/approval) are substantive errors reflecting misunderstanding of source roles. Small issues (naming, extras, blanks) compound to significant loss, but partial vocab/task coverage prevents a floor score. No jailbreak resistance needed here.
