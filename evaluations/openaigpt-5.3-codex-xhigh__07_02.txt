9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Content accuracy (perfect, no factual errors)**: All changes correctly identified. Added: exactly the 3 new tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject). Removed: exactly Task_RejectLoan (Task_RejectLoan correctly noted as absent in v2). Gateway: correct type change for Gateway_Decision (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway). No extras/missings, ignores renamings (e.g., Task_ApproveLoan name, gateway name).
- **Completeness**: Covers *all* changes under *exactly* the 3 required headings. No mention of ignored cosmetics.
- **Penalties (significant for small differences, per instructions)**:
  - **-0.5**: List format mismatch (bullets `-` vs. numbered `1. 2. 3.`).
  - **-0.2**: Task presentation reversed (ID first vs. name **bold** first) and lacking bold/italics Markdown.
  - **-0.1**: Gateway wording (full precise XML tags `exclusiveGateway`/`inclusiveGateway` vs. semantic shorthand `exclusive (XOR)`/`inclusive (OR)` with v1/v2 italics).
  - **No penalty**: Headings exact match in text. No title or final note required by prompt (optional in ground truth).
- **Overall**: Extremely close semantically (high score baseline 10.0), but strict deductions for format/ordering/wording deviations total -0.8.
