**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (driving score up)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), which align perfectly with ground truth and data (e.g., dominant issues in wait, throughput drop, rework, SLA breaches). Memo is concise (~160 words <200), professional format with header, structures explanations clearly (problem + action), bases all claims strictly on table metrics (e.g., 150-min wait, 22% rework, 12.4% SLA, stdev 9), and provides one concrete, data-driven action per activity (targeting specific metrics like rework/queue, variability/SLA).
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Factual error: Claims Initial_Assessment has "second-highest wait time (18 min)" – incorrect; Review_Documents has 30 min (second-highest), Initial is third (-1.0).
  - Minor over-interpretation: Assumes causes like "customers repeatedly fail to submit" or "inconsistent reviewer workload" – not strictly in table, unlike ground truth's metric-focused "why" (-0.4).
  - Incomplete metrics for Review_Documents: Omits its 30-min wait and 25-min processing (longest, as ground truth notes) (-0.3).
  - Recommendation for #3 not singular: "Add capacity... *or* introduce triage" (two options vs. ground truth's one concrete action) (-0.1).
- Overall: Very close in substance/selection (90%+ match), but small data inaccuracy and phrasing divergences warrant deduction per "utmost strictness/small errors = significant loss." No hallucinations outside table or unrelated activities.
