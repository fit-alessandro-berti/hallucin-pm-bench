The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly aligns with the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate/false), structure (case-by-case justification citing IDs and activities), and key evidence (reversed ordering in cases 1001/1003; absence in 1002 disproving "always"). It correctly implies the "immediately before" claim fails due to order reversal (no need for explicit "immediately" restatement given the evidence), uses timestamps equivalently to ground truth's line references, and avoids speculation while basing all on the log. No errors or deviations warrant deduction under strict evaluation.
