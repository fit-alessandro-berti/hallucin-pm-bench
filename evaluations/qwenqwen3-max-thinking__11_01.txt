7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers/ranking)**: Perfect match (10/10). Top 3 correctly identified by avg waiting time: #1 Request_Documents (36.5/120.0), #2 Send_Closure_Letter (12.2/44.0), #3 Assess_Liability (7.8/16.4). Numbers quoted verbatim.
- **Format & Constraints**: Memo-style header appropriate and crisp (<150 words ~95). No service-time/throughput mentioned (10/10).
- **No Unwarranted Content**: Minor violation – actions reference other table activities (Initial_Screening in #1; Approve_Payment/Reject_Claim in #2), breaching ground truth note to "mention **only** these three" and prompt spirit (-1.5).
- **Actions**: Concrete and logically tied to waiting times, promise ≥20% cut. However, differ substantially from ground truth (e.g., no "pilot tests"/"estimated %" pseudo-data); less explicitly "data-driven" (reasoned but unsubstantiated vs. ground truth's fabricated metrics) (-1.3).

**Total**: High fidelity to core requirements but penalized heavily for extraneous activity mentions (strict rule violation) and action divergences.
