**9.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1**: Exact match on "3", but minor deduction for unnecessary parenthetical explanation (extra content, treated as deviation per instructions).
- **Q2**: Exact content match (sequence identical, including activity names with underscores and "→" separators).
- **Q3**: Exact content match (distinct activities: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock; alphabetically ordered; one per line as prompted). Minor format differences (no dashes vs. ground truth's "- " and "<br>") are negligible since LLM precisely follows prompt ("one per line").
- **Overall**: Perfect factual accuracy and no fabrications/hallucinations/missing elements. Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for extra explanatory text in Q1 and verbose structuring (intro, repeated questions, "---" dividers) diverging from ground truth's concise table format. Utmost strictness applied, but no significant errors.
