5.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths**: Correct status and concise justifications for R1, R3, R4, and R6 (all align closely with ground truth, under 20 words). Overall result correctly identifies NON-COMPLIANT due to other violations.
- **Major Errors**: R2 status is incorrectly Compliant (should be Violated); justification ignores the new Manager_Approval (event 8, 2025-03-07) as the "last required approval" post-Change_Request, making Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) non-compliant (>2 days or premature). This is a critical misinterpretation of rule interplay with R5.
- **Minor Errors**: R5 justification omits Pay_Invoice (event 7) as a "further processing step" before new approval, making it incomplete vs. ground truth (still Violated status correct).
- **Format/Strictness**: Adheres to required structure (status + justification), but content accuracy drives score down significantly per instructions— one major rule violation and partial justification warrant ~50% deduction from a perfect 10.0.
