**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Core correctness (major partial credit)**: Correctly identifies "yes" and the key enabling sequence **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5** using the shortcut (T2b bypasses pc/T3), with accurate markings up to pf=1. Demonstrates T5 can fire without prior T3.
- **Critical failures (heavy deductions)**:
  - **Incomplete sequence**: Provides only 4-step sequence stopping at T5; does **not** include T3 firing *after* T5 (requires T6 → pc → T3), failing to fully prove "T5 before T3" in a complete trace. Ground truth explicitly shows 6-step **〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉** with markings.
  - **Not shortest for intent**: Claims 4-steps "shortest" without context; ground truth proves 6-steps minimal for T5-then-T3 ordering (lower bound analysis: T1 + {T2/T2b} + T4 + T5 + T6 + T3).
  - **Factual error**: States "**T5 can not fire in a scenario where T3 has already been fired**" — **false**. Counterexample: T1 → T2 → T3 → T4 → T5 (normal path: pa→pc→pd via T3, then pe→T5).
  - **No explanation of why it works**: Misses feedback loop (T6 reinjects to pc for T3 post-T5); ground truth details shortcut + loop + minimality.
- **Structural/style issues (further deductions)**: Rambling/confused (e.g., "does not fire T3 subsequent", "strictly directly before T3 may not", irrelevant Python comment); repetitive; hedges intent. Ground truth is concise, formal, with "Why this works" + proof.
- **Strictness applied**: Small errors (e.g., no minimality proof) → ~1pt loss; incompleteness + factual error → -3+ pts; messiness → -1pt. Baseline ~7 for partial sequence → net 4.2.
