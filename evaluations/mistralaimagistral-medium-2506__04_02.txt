4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Major error—status incorrectly "Violated" instead of "Compliant"; justification misinterprets rule (approvals did occur before processing). (-2.0 points)
- **R2**: Major error—status incorrectly "Compliant" instead of "Violated"; justification ignores impact of change request on "last approval" timing. (-2.0 points)
- **R3**: Correct status and justification (minor date formatting nitpick, but accurate). (+1.0)
- **R4**: Fully correct. (+1.0)
- **R5**: Correct status; justification similar but slightly less precise than ground truth (omits Pay_Invoice explicitly). (+0.5, partial)
- **R6**: Fully correct. (+1.0)
- **Overall Result**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). (+0.5)
- **Format/Extras**: Mostly adheres (statuses bolded, justifications ≤20 words), but extraneous note (*) deviates from strict format. (-0.5)
- **Strictness Note**: Two rule statuses flipped entirely, leading to substantial deduction; even partial justification accuracy doesn't offset core violations.
