6.0

Rationale:

- **R1:** LLM answer is **Violated**, but ground truth is **Compliant**. The LLM incorrectly claims further processing before approval, but initial approvals are in correct order before the change; Rule R1 only requires this initial approval chain. This is a critical factual error (−2 full points).
- **R2:** LLM says **Compliant**, ground truth is **Violated**. The LLM uses the *first* approval but does not recognize the need to obtain a new approval after the change and bases the 2-day window on the wrong step. This is a major regulatory misinterpretation (−2 points).
- **R3:** Both answers **Violated**, and the explanation is accurate. (No point lost.)
- **R4:** Both answers **Not Applicable** with correct and concise justification. (No point lost.)
- **R5:** Both say **Violated**, with a succinct, accurate justification. Small ambiguity about what approvals are missing (LLM is less precise; it fails to note that both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice happened before the new approval, but it is generally accurate.) Minor deduction (−0.5).
- **R6:** Both say **Compliant**, explanation is accurate. (No point lost.)
- **Conclusion:** Both say **NON-COMPLIANT**. (No point lost.)
- LLM's R1 rationale suggests a misunderstanding of rule scope; R2 reflects a major process analysis error.

**Total deduction**: -2 (R1) -2 (R2) -0.5 (minor in R5) = -4.5 from 10.  
**Final score: 6.0**  
The response makes critical errors for 2/6 rules and lacks the required strict correlation to the rules, though structure and some content accuracy is present.
