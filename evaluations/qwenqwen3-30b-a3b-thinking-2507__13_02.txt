- Q1: Correct, "1 time (only in case C05)" â€“ matches ground truth.
- Q2a: Correct, "2.08%" and calculation shown.
- Q2b: Correct, "8.33%" and calculation shown.
- Q3: Clearly notes the single occurrence, the statistical insignificance, and warns about over-generalization and risk in process mining models. It slightly lacks the explicit mention of "variance/instability" or "wide confidence interval," but phrases like "statistically insignificant," "skewing performance metrics," and "overemphasize rare paths" sufficiently capture the cautions required, though a slightly more precise mention of instability would be preferable.

**Reason for deduction:**  
The explanation in (3) could be a little clearer on the consequences of variance/instability and estimation unreliability, and it doesn't directly mention "confidence intervals" or model sensitivity to the single observation, which the ground truth points out as key. This is a minor omission, but, per strict criteria, warrants a deduction.

**Summary:** Precise, complete on numeric answers; nearly perfect on the explanation with only a small gap in statistical nuance.
