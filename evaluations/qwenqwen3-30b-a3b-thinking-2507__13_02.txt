The LLM answer fully matches the ground truth on questions 1 and 2 (exact counts and percentages, including calculations and rounding). For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (98 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue, highlights instability/variance through terms like "statistically insignificant," "skewing performance metrics," and "overemphasize rare paths," and cautions against over-generalization by noting misrepresentation of the standard process and risks to predictive models and optimization. No deviations or inventions from the log.
