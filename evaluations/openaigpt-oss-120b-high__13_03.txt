### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (count of 1, with correct reference). Full points here.
- **Question 2**: The response is concise (under 120 words) and correctly identifies core issues like small sample size (14 events, few cases), temporal bias (single morning, <2 hours implied), selection bias, and non-representativeness, leading to potential over/underestimation. However, it omits critical ground truth elements: statistical fragility (e.g., frequency swinging from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events) and the confounding factor of near-synonyms (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), which could distort estimates via strict vs. fuzzy matching. These omissions are significant gaps in explaining misestimation risks, warranting a notable deduction under strict criteria. Minor speculation (e.g., "batches that never trigger") slightly detracts but is not disqualifying. Overall, strong but incomplete alignment.
