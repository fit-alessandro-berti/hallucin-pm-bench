### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a valid justification by citing the two relevant counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with their sequences, which directly violate the "always immediate" claim. This aligns with the task's requirements for a Yes/No answer and justification via CaseIDs and sequences.

However, under strict evaluation:
- **Incompleteness (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: The ground truth provides a comprehensive case-by-case analysis of *all* four cases (C001-C004), including those that comply (C001, C003) to fully contextualize why "always" fails. The LLM omits this, making the justification partial and less meticulous, as required by the system prompt ("meticulous process-mining analyst" relying only on evidence).
- **Lack of structure and explicit conclusion (minor deduction: -0.5 points)**: No table or notes for clarity; no direct statement explaining how these cases disprove "always" (e.g., "two out of four violate the rule"). This is a small formatting/precision error but warrants deduction per instructions.
- **Accuracy and fidelity to log (no deduction)**: Sequences cited are precise and evidence-based; no factual errors in the log interpretation.

Overall, the answer is functionally correct and sufficient for the task but falls short of the ground truth's thoroughness, resulting in a mid-high score rather than perfect.
