7.0

The LLM answer delivers the correct answer ("No") and explicitly cites the two relevant case sequences (C002 and C004) that directly violate the FACT. This covers the minimum justification needed and accurately supports its conclusion.

However, when judged with utmost strictness and compared to the ground truth, several deficiencies appear:

- The answer omits the two cases (C001 and C003) where the fact actually holds true; the ground truth explicitly lists all cases for completeness.
- There is no structured reasoning or indication of a methodical review of all possible cases; the LLM just points out the negative counterexamples.
- The answer does not explicitly emphasize that these exceptions are why the claim is false, nor does it discuss the proportion/implication (e.g., "two out of four cases violate the rule").
- There is no tabular or systematic format that clearly distinguishes the "immediate successor" relation, as seen in the ground truth.

Given these omissions, while the answer is factually correct and cites exactly the key counterexamples, it falls short in thoroughness, completeness, clarity, and structure. These shortcomings justify a significant downgrade from a perfect score.
