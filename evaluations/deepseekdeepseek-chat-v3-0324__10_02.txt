6.0

**Justification:**

**Correctness and Vocabulary**
- The LLM answer uses the correct mandated terms (“Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “KYC Review”, and “IT Support”) and does not violate the vocabulary mandate.
- However, **“Operations Manager”** from the ground truth is completely absent from the LLM answer. The prompt does not mandate its removal; its omission is a significant deviation, as it is Accountable for all tasks in the ground truth.

**Task Mapping**
- The activities are generally present and clearly mapped to the tasks in the informal description.
- Step descriptions are close in meaning to those in the ground truth, though some wordings differ (e.g., “Archive case file” vs “Archive Record”).

**RACI Assignments**
- The assignments for Responsible and Accountable roles diverge significantly in several cases:
    - For example, the LLM assigns Accountable largely to “Regulatory Liaison”, but the ground truth has “Operations Manager” as Accountable throughout.
    - “Consulted” and “Informed” assignments differ, sometimes missing or assigned incorrectly (e.g., “Transaction Analyst” is Informed for “KYC Review”, not Consulted as in the ground truth). 
    - LLM sometimes assigns dual Responsible/Accountable to the same role (“Regulatory Liaison” for KYC Review and High-Risk Approval), which the ground truth does not do.

**Table Structure and Formatting**
- The LLM table omits the “Operations Manager” column completely.
- The “Key Notes” are helpful but do not compensate for inaccurate RACI allocation.

**Other Details**
- The LLM introduces some roles as both Responsible and Accountable for the same action, which generally contravenes best RACI practice (the ground truth reserves “A” for a separate role).
- Step 6 (“the compliance officer is notified”) is mapped by the LLM as the Regulatory Liaison being Informed, which is reasonable.

**Conclusion**
- **Major error**: Omission of “Operations Manager” (a required role in the ground truth).
- **Significant errors**: RACI assignments differ nontrivially from ground truth (especially “Accountable”).
- **Moderate errors**: Table structure inconsistency and some ambiguous task vocabulary.

Therefore, it loses 4 full points (from a perfect 10.0 to 6.0) due to the cumulative effect of these substantial differences.
