2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a very low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Structure and Format**: The LLM uses a traditional RACI-column format with roles populated in cells (standard but not matching ground truth). The ground truth uses role-columns with R/A/C/I letters in cells, plus a "Legend." This is a fundamental mismatch in presentation. Additionally, the LLM includes unnecessary introductory text ("Here’s the RACI table...") and "Key Notes" section, violating the prompt's focus on "Put the table in Markdown" without extras. Ground truth is concise with only a minimal legend and note.

- **Roles Used**: The LLM correctly limits to mandated terms (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison) plus source-mentioned IT Support, avoiding unprompted additions. However, the ground truth introduces "Operations Manager" (OM) as a core column with assignments (e.g., A for most tasks), which the LLM lacks entirely. This creates a complete role-set mismatch, as every ground truth row relies on OM for accountability.

- **Activities/Tasks Covered**: The LLM expands to 7 rows, separating "Release approved payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" (addressing the source's distinct actions in step 5), while rephrasing others descriptively (e.g., "Receive and log customer’s transfer instruction in the system"). The ground truth uses 6 shorter rows, combining release/SWIFT into one ("Release Payment") and omitting explicit SWIFT handling. Wordings differ (e.g., LLM's "Archive case file" vs. ground truth's "Archive Record"), and the LLM covers "every task" more granularly but introduces non-exact phrasing not aligned with ground truth.

- **R/A/C/I Assignments**: Nearly every cell differs significantly, even adjusting for format:
  - Receive: LLM (R=TA, A=RL, I=IT) vs. ground truth (R=TA, A=OM, C=IT, I=RL) – accountability mismatch (RL vs. OM), and I vs. C for IT/RL.
  - Screen: LLM (R=TA, A=RL) vs. ground truth (R=TA, A=RL, I=OM, C=IT) – missing I/C assignments.
  - KYC Review: LLM (R=RL, A=RL, I=TA) vs. ground truth (C=TA, R=RL, A=OM, I=IT) – TA as I vs. C; A=RL vs. OM; IT missing in LLM.
  - Approve: Similar mismatches (e.g., LLM I=TA vs. ground C=TA; A=RL vs. OM).
  - Release: LLM (R=TA, A=RL, C=IT) vs. ground truth (R=TA, A=OM, C=IT, I=RL) – A and I swapped/added.
  - SWIFT (extra in LLM, absent in ground): LLM (R=IT, A=IT, C=TA, I=RL) has no equivalent, creating an uncaptured task in comparison.
  - Archive: LLM (R=IT, A=IT, I=RL) vs. ground truth (R=IT, A=OM, C=TA, I=RL) – A=IT vs. OM; missing C=TA.

- **Vocabulary and Fidelity to Prompt/Source**: Both use "KYC Review" correctly and mandated roles where applicable, but the LLM's interpretations (e.g., RL as A for operational tasks like receive/screen/release, IT as A for SWIFT/archive) add unsubstantiated accountability not in the source or ground truth. The ground truth better maps source steps without extras but errs by adding OM, which indirectly penalizes the LLM via differences.

These are not minor; the assignments and roles form the core of a RACI table, and variances indicate poor alignment with the ground truth's intended mapping. Small issues (e.g., wording, extras) compound to major fidelity loss. A score above 2.0 would understate the discrepancies.
