The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact same minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) as the ground truth for Q2. The explanation accurately describes the token flow, enabling condition for T5, and why T3 is avoided, aligning closely with the ground truth's logic without errors, though it omits step-by-step markings (not required by the prompt). Concise and under word limit; no differences impacting validity or completeness.
