The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in answering "yes" with a correct minimal firing sequence ⟨T1, T2, T5⟩ proving T5 fires before T3 (p3=1, p4=0 post-T2). It provides equivalent detailed markings, enablement check, and justification (T5 requires p4=0, which holds iff T3 unfired; notes T3-first disables T5 permanently, matching ground truth's "only reachable markings... T3 has not yet fired" and "must... if it is ever to occur"). Style differences (e.g., full markings vs. inline, sequence length, LaTeX) are superficial; no errors or omissions in required proof/sequence.
