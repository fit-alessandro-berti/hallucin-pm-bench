### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part a) (Decision Points)**: Identifies the exact two decision points correctly (risk-skip and TriVote), with rules accurately summarized in one sentence each. Minor deductions for phrasing deviations (e.g., naming "Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3)" vs. ground truth's "Risk-based skip after..."; adding parenthetical "Otherwise..." and "Only one...insufficient" which are implied but extraneous; "any two" vs. "at least two...record 'Approve'"). ~8.5/10.
- **Part b) (Documents)**: Severe incompleteness—lists only 5/9 items, **omitting the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)** which are explicitly required as inputs/documents first appearing in Step 3 (bolded like others). Fails to distinguish "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (Step 8) from unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" (Step 7). Order otherwise correct for listed items, no hallucinations. ~0.0/10 equivalent impact.
- **Overall**: Part b)'s major omissions (4/9 missing items, core process elements) dominate under "utmost strictness"; small a) issues compound but secondary. No formatting/structural penalties as both match intent.
