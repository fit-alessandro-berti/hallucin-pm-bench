### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (partial credit, significant deduction for extraneous inclusion)**: The LLM correctly identifies three new tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), matching the ground truth. However, it incorrectly lists Task_ApproveLoan as added (despite its own contradictory note about it being a rename), which violates the instruction to ignore cosmetic renamings and introduces a factual error. This alone warrants a major deduction under strict criteria.
- **Removed tasks (complete miss, heavy deduction)**: The LLM states "None," but Task_RejectLoan is clearly removed in v2 (no longer present or connected). This is a critical omission, failing to capture a core change.
- **Gateway-type changes (minor credit, small deductions)**: The LLM accurately notes the shift from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision, aligning with the ground truth. Minor issues include imprecise formatting (e.g., "ExclusiveGateway_Decision" instead of specifying the ID cleanly and adding XOR/OR explanation) and lack of full context (e.g., no mention of v1/v2), but these are less severe.
- **Overall structure and adherence**: Headings are used exactly as required, and the response is concise. However, the instruction to summarize *all* changes strictly under these headings is violated by incomplete coverage (missing removal) and inaccurate addition, leading to substantial point loss per the strictness guideline. No other unmentioned changes (e.g., name updates, flows) are invented, which avoids further penalty. Total score reflects ~50% accuracy with critical errors dragging it down.
