The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifies "No" with precise counterexamples (C002 and C004), accurate sequences with timestamps, and clear explanation disproving "always." Minor deductions for: (1) lacking exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all 4 cases (omits C001/C003 verification, unlike ground truth table); (2) no quantification ("two out of four"); (3) different format (bullets vs. table), reducing structural fidelity despite functional equivalence. No factual errors.
