**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically on both core requirements of the prompt:

- **Decision points**: Completely absent. Instead, it vaguely lists *all nine process steps* as generic "key checkpoints" using invented names (e.g., "dual underwriter evaluation", "alignment scrutiny", "evaluating the amount") that deviate from exact terminology ("Dual Underwriter Split", "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision"). No conditions, logic, or specifics (e.g., score difference ≤2, €15k threshold, board vote approve/reject) are mentioned—zero match to ground truth's three precise decision points.

- **Required documents**: Not listed at all. Only a generic non-specific statement ("all required documents must be submitted"), ignoring the exact six items with precise phrasing (e.g., "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)", "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)").

Additional violations: Introduces forbidden "standard loan terminology" vibes via "checkpoints" and process summary; ignores "use exactly the activity names given". Total non-compliance justifies minimum score under strict criteria.
