8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in core requirements: correctly identifies the **same three activities** (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment, in matching order), **quantifies SLA exceedances identically** (+300s, +300s, +60s), lists waiting times accurately, and structures as an executive memo (~150 words) with **bullet points only for recommendations**. It grounds everything in table data without fabricating metrics like the ground truth's invalid "4 805 completed cases" (table sums to ~5,885) or "35% end-to-end reduction."

**Significant deductions (-2.0 total)** for stylistic/structural differences from ground truth:
- Header lacks subject line and uses slightly different phrasing ("Orion Credit COO" vs. "Chief Operating Officer"; "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" matches system role but differs from ground truth's "Process Performance Office").
- Analysis uses numbered list instead of bolded paragraphs; adds ungrounded interpretive sentence ("capacity constraints").
- **Recommendations differ entirely** in content (LLM: staffing additions assuming 50% wait reductions; ground truth: automation/bypasses with inventions like "€25k"). LLM's are arguably more data-driven (e.g., Legal's 50% wait cut precisely hits SLA assuming fixed processing time), but exact mismatch penalizes strictly.
- No closing projection (present in ground truth).

No major prompt violations (e.g., no absent activities/metrics), but strict similarity scoring yields 8.0—excellent core fidelity, moderate losses for variances.
