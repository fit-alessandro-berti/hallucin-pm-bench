The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" as the response, provides a concise one-paragraph justification citing the exact counterexamples (C003 with lines 6-7 where Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order, and C005 with line 11 lacking any prior Receive_Order), and aligns precisely with the ground truth in structure, content, and reasoning without any factual errors, omissions, or extraneous details.
