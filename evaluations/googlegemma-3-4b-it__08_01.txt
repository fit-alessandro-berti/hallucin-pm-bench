**4.0**

The LLM answer demonstrates some understanding of the net but suffers from significant errors:

- **Step 2 error:** After T1 fires, the marking should be p1(1), p2(1), not p2(0). The LLM incorrectly writes p2(0). This error propagates, suggesting that p2 is lost after T1.
- **Step 3 error:** After T2 fires, the marking should be p3(1), p2(1), not p3(1), p2(0).
- **Step 4 error:** After T5 fires, the marking should be p2(1), p6(1), but the LLM gives p2(0), p6(1), losing the remaining p2 token.
- **Step 5 error:** The LLM gives "p3 → p6" for T3; this is incorrect, as per net definition T3 is p2 → p4, not p3 → p6.

While the LLM recognizes that T5 can fire before T3 (central to the answer), it makes systematic marking errors in the sequence and mis-describes the net structure in step 5.

These inaccuracies are *critical* for Petri net analysis—conservation of tokens is essential, and transition pre/postsets must be respected exactly.

**Summary:** The LLM answer gets the principal property right (T5 must fire before T3 if at all), but its concrete firing sequence repeatedly fails to respect the net's token-flow logic. Given strict grading standards for Petri net correctness, these point losses each cost several marks.
