The LLM answer is substantively correct and matches the ground truth in content for all questions, with accurate identification of cases, the preceding activity, and the unique activity. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., adding explanatory phrases like "immediately precedes... for case C456" and "appears exactly once," which exceed the "concise" instruction and differ from the ground truth's brevity) and formatting variations (e.g., backticks vs. no markup, full labels vs. "A1"/"A2"). No factual errors, but strict adherence to ground truth format would warrant a perfect score.
