- The LLM answer correctly identifies all three unique cases: `C123`, `C456`, and `C789`.
- It correctly identifies that `Pack_Items` immediately precedes `Ship_Order` in case `C456`.
- It correctly states that `Cancel_Order` appears exactly once.

Minor deduction (0.5) for stylistic differences and lack of strict adherence to the concise, bullet-point formatting as in the ground truth, such as presenting the answers with "**Answer to X**" instead of simple bullet points or the requested asterisk-bullet format, and quoting attribute values. However, all factual content is correct.
