9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Exact match (1 occurrence). Full points.
- **Q2**: Numerically correct (5.56, matching 1/18 × 100). However, omits the "%" symbol explicitly required in the ground truth format (`5.56 %`), introducing a minor but noticeable formatting deviation under strict criteria. Deduct 0.2 points.
- **Q3**: Correctly identifies the sole case (A1002). Ground truth phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains...") is more explicit, but the LLM's listing fulfills the "list the case identifier(s)" request without error or hallucination. Full points.
- **Q4**: Provides two clear, sampling-related reasons that align well with ground truth examples: (i) addresses temporal bias (short one-day span vs. monthly extrapolation, including patterns); (ii) directly matches small sample size (18 events/4 cases, high variance/poor representativeness). No unjustified inferences; stays grounded in the log data. However, lacks the ground truth's quantitative detail (e.g., ±5.56 percentage points on variance) and doesn't explore other biases like case-mix or survivorship, making it slightly less comprehensive than the ideal. Deduct 0.3 points total.

Overall: The answer is highly accurate, derives everything from the log without hallucination, and answers all questions directly. Minor formatting and depth issues prevent a perfect score under utmost strictness.
