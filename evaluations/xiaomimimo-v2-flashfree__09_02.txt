The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in reasoning, accuracy, and completeness: both correctly identify the absence of timestamps as the reason cycle time cannot be computed, referencing the provided artifacts (event log header noting no timestamps released, frequency table with only counts and transitions). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., two sentences vs. one, phrasing like "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," specific XES attribute mention) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as the prompt requires a concise explanation of impossibility, which is fully met without deviations in fact or logic.
