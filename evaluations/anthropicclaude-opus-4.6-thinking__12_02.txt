9.0

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in correctly answering **No**, identifying the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005), and proving the claim false with precise reasoning about precedence and absence. It adheres to the "one paragraph" format better than the ground truth's bullets. Minor deductions for: (1) imprecise citation of "lines 11–12" for C005 (Validate_Payment is only line 11; line 12 is Cancel_Order, making this sloppy), (2) unnecessary addition of timestamps (accurate but extraneous to ground truth and prompt's citation focus), and (3) minor formatting diffs (**No.** vs **No**). Under utmost strictness, these small inaccuracies warrant a 1.0-point loss from perfect.
