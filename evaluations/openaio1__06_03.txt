9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks and numbers them in order, strictly limiting its output to Process B as requested. The answer matches all required content from the ground truth. However, the answer is slightly less explicit: it omits descriptive labels like "first parallel block" or explanatory phrasing, and does not include the note "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." While brevity is generally good, the lack of this explicit terminal statement is a minor omission. For utmost strictness, this omission merits a deduction, thus a 9.0.
