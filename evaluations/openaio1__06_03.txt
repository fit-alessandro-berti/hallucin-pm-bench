The LLM answer precisely identifies and lists the two concurrent sets in order, matching the core content of the ground truth without extraneous information about other processes or unsubstantiated claims. Minor formatting differences (e.g., curly braces vs. descriptive labels and â€– symbol) do not alter the factual accuracy or completeness relative to the prompt's requirements, as the substance is identical and the ground truth's additions (e.g., "No other tasks...") are not mandated by the prompt.
