The LLM answer correctly identifies the three parallel blocks and lists the tasks accurately matching the ground truth, with no inclusion of tasks from other processes or sequential tasks in the core lists. However, it deviates significantly from the strict format instructions by adding an unnecessary introduction, bold formatting, explanatory parenthetical notes after each line (which mention sequential tasks and process flow not requested), and a "Key notes" section that explicitly discusses exclusions and inclusions, including examples of sequential tasks. These extras violate the prompt's clear directive to return *only* numbered lines with comma-separated tasks, introducing verbose content that inflates the response and reduces fidelity to the ground truth. Under utmost strictness, this structural non-compliance and addition of unrequested details warrant a substantial deduction, despite the factual accuracy of the task lists.
