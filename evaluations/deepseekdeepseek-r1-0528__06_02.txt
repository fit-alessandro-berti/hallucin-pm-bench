9.5

The LLM answer lists exactly the same task sets as the ground truth, in the correct order and with correct task names, separated by commas. It also avoids including any non-concurrent or irrelevant tasks, and does not mention Processes A or C as instructed. 

The main (very minor) deviation is the presence of brief explanatory comments after each answer line and a “Key notes” section at the bottom, which, although clarifying, are not strictly required and constitute slight over-answering beyond the specific enumeration requested. According to strict grading, even minor deviations from the format should reflect in some point deduction.

Thus, the answer is highly accurate in content but is awarded 9.5 due to exceeding the strict requested format (“numbered lines; in each line list the tasks... nothing else”).
