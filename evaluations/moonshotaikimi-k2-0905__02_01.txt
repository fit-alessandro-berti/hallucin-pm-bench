The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (an activity that does appear as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an extraneous item in the list. This is a clear factual error, warranting a 2-point deduction under strict evaluation criteria for even moderate inaccuracies in a structured response.
