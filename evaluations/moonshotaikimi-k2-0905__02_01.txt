8.0

The LLM answer is almost entirely correct but contains one error:

- Q1: 3 → Correct.
- Q2: "Pack_Items" → Correct.
- Q3: "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00" → Correct.
- Q4: 2 → Correct.
- Q5: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order", "Quality_Check"]
    - ERROR: "Quality_Check" appears as the first event of case C-77 and therefore should NOT be listed. The correct answer omits this item.

This is a non-trivial error—a wrong element in a required exclusive list. All other answers are perfect, but including an incorrect extra in Q5 should result in a meaningful point deduction. Given the "utmost strictness" requested, this deserves to be reflected strongly in the grade.

Therefore: **8.0**
