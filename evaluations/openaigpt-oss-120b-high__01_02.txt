7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth (GT), focusing on accuracy, completeness, fidelity to the prompt (e.g., exact activity names, no standard terminology), and structure/content alignment. The two sections are assessed separately, then averaged for the overall score. Small deviations (e.g., phrasing) incur deductions, and substantive errors (e.g., misidentifying decision points) lead to larger losses.

#### Decision Points (Score: 6.0/10.0)
- **Strengths**: Correctly identifies and describes the three true decision points from GT (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval). Uses exact terminology (e.g., "≤ 2 points", "Harmonisation Committee", "auto-approves", "votes approve or reject"). No introduction of standard loan terms.
- **Errors/Deductions** (significant, per strict criteria):
  - Includes an extraneous fourth "decision point" (Neighbourhood Feedback Check/NFC), which GT omits entirely. NFC is a procedural step requiring collection of ≥3 references, not a branching decision (no "if/else" flow like the others). This misrepresents the process flow, inflating the list and implying a decision where none exists. (-2.0 points for addition and mischaracterization; the process steps are numbered 1-9, but decision points are a subset—GT correctly isolates them without referencing step numbers or non-decision activities.)
  - Structures as a table with process step numbers (5,6,7,8), diverging from GT's simple numbered list of pure decision points (1-3). This adds unnecessary context and disrupts direct alignment. (-1.0 point for structural deviation and inclusion of step references.)
  - Minor phrasing: Uses em-dashes and bullets in Amount Threshold, slightly more verbose than GT's concise "*If... ⇒ ...*" format. (-0.5 point for stylistic inflation, though not introducing new terms.)
  - In NFC description: Implies a gating decision ("proceeds only when"), but the prompt treats it as a mandatory collection step without specified rejection logic—GT ignores it as non-decisional. This interpretive addition amplifies the error.

Overall, captures core content but with a key misidentification and structural extras, reducing fidelity.

#### Required Documents (Score: 9.0/10.0)
- **Strengths**: Lists all six exact documents from the prompt/GT, using precise names (e.g., "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)", "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet"). No omissions or additions. Emphasizes completeness with a closing sentence mirroring GT's note on exclusions (e.g., no standard docs).
- **Errors/Deductions** (minor, but strict penalty applied):
  - Phrasing variations: Adds "must be ≤ 3 months old" (verbose vs. GT's "(≤ 3 months)"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (extra "single" not in GT's "pay-stub/tax slip"); " (CIS) template" (includes "template" from prompt, but GT abbreviates to "(CIS)"—neutral but slight deviation). (-0.5 point cumulative for verbosity.)
  - Extra sentence ("These are the only documents...") is helpful but interpretive, not in GT; it aligns with intent but adds unprompted queue reference. (-0.5 point for addition beyond exact list.)

List is nearly identical and complete, with deductions only for non-substantive tweaks.

#### Overall Score Calculation
- Weighted average (equal parts): (6.0 + 9.0) / 2 = 7.5. The decision points error is the primary drag, as it alters process understanding; documents are strong but not flawless under strict scrutiny. No jailbreak/policy issues; evaluation is neutral and factual.
