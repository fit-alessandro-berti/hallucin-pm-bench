7.5

**Justification:**

*Strengths:*
- The LLM answer uses the proper activity names throughout (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)").
- All required documents are listed, using the official names and with generally correct descriptions.
- The decision points are clearly explained and mapped to the correct steps.

*Issues impacting score:*
1. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC) misrepresented as a decision point:**  
   - In the official process, NFC is an information collection/verification step, not a discrete decision or branching point. The official ground truth lists only three decision points (no decision is made at NFC; it is a prerequisite, not a filter/gate).
   - The LLM inserted NFC as an explicit "decision point" in their table, which does not align with required precision. This is a significant conceptual error.

2. **Wording and detail issues:**
   - The LLM says "These are the only documents that must accompany the application when it enters the queue." While not strictly wrong, this explanation adds language not in the ground truth and omits the specific instruction “no credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents” are needed. The omission slightly lessens clarity about *excluded* documents.
   - Some phrasings ("loan proceeds only when…") are less precise than required.

3. **Formatting and completeness:**
   - The LLM answer’s use of a table for decision points is fine, but it breaks up the flow and adds mild ambiguity compared to the ordered, concise presentation requested.
   - The descriptions are wordier and less concise than the ground truth, and do not follow the requested minimal, enumerated style.

*Severity of errors:*
- **NFC as a decision gate** is a substantial process misunderstanding in this context (approx. –1.5 points).
- **Not emphasizing excluded documents** and imprecise wording (approx. –1 point).

**Summary:**  
Most major elements are present and strictly named, but the addition of an incorrect decision point and some omission of required "exclusions" reduce compliance to strictness. Therefore, 7.5 is appropriate: significant errors that impact process accuracy, but fundamentals otherwise correct.
