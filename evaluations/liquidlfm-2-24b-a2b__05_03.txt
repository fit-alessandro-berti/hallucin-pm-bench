**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally flawed: invalid/malformed XML (nested sequence flows inside gateway definition); broken logic (variable `#endOf48Hours = #currentTime + 48h` at gateway makes condition always true, checks before starting "Create Account" instead of enforcing its completion); ignores SLA start from "Verify Identity" end; adds unnecessary new flows/variable instead of using existing escalation path; terminates to rejection instead of escalating; incorrect justification (references wrong task "identity verification" and wrong enforcement mechanism). Zero alignment with ground truth's precise boundary timer + existing task routing.
