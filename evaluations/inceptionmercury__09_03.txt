The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of computation due to absent data and timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning. It specifies the need for start/complete times per instance and references the artefacts' limitations (structure only, no data). However, it deducts points for slightly less precision: it does not explicitly cite "Artefact A" or quote the redaction of "all event rows and every timestamp value" as described, opting for a more generalized phrasing ("no actual data or timestamps"), and it unnecessarily restates the task at the start, making it marginally less concise than the ground truth.
