8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the calculation cannot be performed due to the absence of data, and does not attempt to guess or use outside knowledge, in strict adherence to instruction 3.

However, compared to the more concise and technically specific ground truth answer, there are small but notable differences:

- The LLM answer is less specific in referencing which parts of the data are missing: it says that "actual data or timestamps" are not present, whereas the ground truth spells out the absence of any event rows and crucially, both start_time and complete_time values.
- The LLM answer repeats the task as a setup ("To compute... we would need..."). While accurate, it is a less direct response to the prompt, and does not immediately state impossibility.
- The ground truth more explicitly refers to the redaction and the necessity of concrete times for any “Approve Invoice” execution.

For these reasons—slight lack of specificity about exactly what's missing (start_time / complete_time for the required activity), and verbosity rather than a direct impossibility statement—there is a noticeable (though not major) downgrade. Strictness demands more precise language and thorough referencing of what exactly precludes calculation.

Therefore, the score is 8.5.
