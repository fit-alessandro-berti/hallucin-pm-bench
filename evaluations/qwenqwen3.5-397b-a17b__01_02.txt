**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, identifying all correct decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing every required document exactly as per the prompt's terminology. No factual errors, no introduction of standard loan terms, and precise use of activity names. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Decision points (deduct 1.0 total)**:
  - Missing explicit positioning: GT specifies "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" (#1) and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (#2); LLM omits.
  - Phrasing diffs: LLM more verbose/full sentences (e.g., "Compares the risk scores... Proceed to NFC" vs GT's concise "*If... ⇒ continue*"); "> 2 points" vs "else"; "send to" vs "Proceed to".
  - Minor: "Decision Points" capitalized vs "Decision points"; italics *approve/reject* vs **Approve/Reject**.

- **Required documents (deduct 0.5 total)**:
  - Wording diffs vs GT: "≤ 3 months old" vs "≤ 3 months"; "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "(CIS) template" vs "(CIS)".
  - Style: Bullets vs numbered; "### Required Documents" vs "#### Required documents (complete list)".
  - Missing GT's extra note (though not required by prompt).

- **Overall structure/style (deduct 0.5)**: "###" headers vs "####"; sub-bullets vs inline *If*; no exact match in conciseness/flow.

Content excellence (10 base) minus strict deductions for ~10 small diffs = 8.0. Perfect match would be verbatim GT.
