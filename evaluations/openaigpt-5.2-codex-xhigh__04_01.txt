The LLM answer correctly determines "Non-compliant" and accurately identifies the two violating rules (2 and 3) with precise event citations and rule references, matching the core reasoning of the ground truth. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major deduction (-1.5):** Incomplete audit; omits explicit verification of all 5 rules (e.g., no mention of Rule 1 satisfied despite high PO amount requiring it, or Rules 4/5). Ground truth provides full, numbered status for every rule, which is expected for a "senior process-audit bot" to fully justify compliance decision.
- **Minor deduction (-0.5):** Slight imprecision in Rule 3 wording ("four events later" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"); while violation is correct, terminology differs from rule's "distance ≤ 2" phrasing and ground truth calculation (likely lag = position diff -1 = 3).
- Stylistic differences (e.g., no "Justification" header, no concluding summary sentence, em-dash vs. hyphen) warrant no further deduction as they are non-substantive.

Overall strong but not exhaustive match to ground truth structure/content.
