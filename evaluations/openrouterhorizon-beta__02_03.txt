The LLM answer is factually correct and matches the ground truth content precisely across all three questions, with appropriate conciseness and bullet-point format. Minor deductions for slight variations in labeling (e.g., "Distinct cases:" vs. "**A1:** 3 cases") and added descriptive phrasing in Q2/Q3 (restating question elements, increasing verbosity beyond the ground truth's minimalism), which deviate from the ideal strict adherence to the most concise presentation.
