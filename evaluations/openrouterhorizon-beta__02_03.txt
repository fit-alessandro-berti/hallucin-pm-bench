9.5

- The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in content and order.
- Extremely minor: The "concise, bullet-point answers" is a bit less terse (e.g., "Distinct cases: 3 (C123, C456, C789)" vs "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"), and doesn't use bolding or precise format as the ground truth.
- The information, however, is fully correct and the bulleted style is compliant.

Deducting 0.5 for not absolutely matching the brevity and formatting of the ground truth, but otherwise flawless on facts.
