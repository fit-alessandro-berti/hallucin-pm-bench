The LLM answer is substantively correct and matches the ground truth in answering "Yes" to Q1 with a valid explanation, providing the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), and accurate markings that lead to T5 firing before T3. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: less formal formatting (e.g., no bolding or numbered steps), slightly different phrasing in explanations (omits the bonus detail on T3 disablement post-T5), and minor spacing inconsistencies in markings (e.g., no spaces after braces). These are small but warrant a slight point loss under strict evaluation criteria. Word count compliant (~85 words).
