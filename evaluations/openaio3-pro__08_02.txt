**Score: 9.5**

**Justification:**

The LLM answer is accurate, concise, and logically matches the ground truth answer.

- **Q1**: The answer is correct; T5 can fire before T3, as explained.
- **Q2**: The firing sequence given (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) exactly matches the ground truth (step-by-step markings are provided and correct).
- **Explanation**: The reasoning is solid: it clearly outlines how P5 and P2 are marked, enabling T5 before T3.

**Minor issues:**
- The phrase "the P2-token is kept" could be made clearer as "the token remains in P2", but it is still understandable.
- The expression could be slightly more precise in referencing how T5’s firing disables T3 (as noted in the ground truth), though the main point is present.

**Overall**, this is nearly perfect, only missing the most nuanced part of stating directly that after T5 fires, T3 becomes disabled—though that point is strongly implied. Thus, 9.5/10.
