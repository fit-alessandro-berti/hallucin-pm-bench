### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in several critical areas, warranting a low score under strict criteria:

- **Structure and Formatting (minor but cumulative deductions)**: Uses bolded "MEMORANDUM" header instead of simple "To/From/Subject" lines. "From" matches the prompt's role but differs from ground truth's "Process Performance Office." Subject is relevant but not identical. No closing projection, unlike ground truth's impact statement.

- **Introduction and Selection (moderate deduction)**: Correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). However, intro omits ground truth's total cases reference (4,805, derived from data sum ≈5,885—ground truth has minor math error, but LLM avoids this entirely). Order is reversed (Risk Review first vs. Legal Approval first), implying different severity ranking despite equal +300s breaches for top two; Legal Approval's higher absolute times (900s throughput, 600s wait) suggest it as worst, per ground truth logic—small error but significant for joint criteria.

- **Quantification of SLA Breaches (significant deduction)**: Accurately states excesses (+300s, +60s, +300s) and waiting times, grounding in data. However, invents unprovided metrics: percentages (100%, 25%, 50% excesses; 80% waiting share for Risk Review). Prompt forbids "no metrics that are not provided"—these derivations count as invention, directly violating rules and differing from ground truth's raw numbers only (e.g., "**900 s** vs. 600 s SLA ( +300 s )").

- **Recommendations (major deduction)**: Uses required bullet points, each tied to data (e.g., specific waiting times mentioned). Actions are concrete and data-driven but entirely different from ground truth: parallel processing (vs. adding analyst/automation); resource reallocation (vs. straight-through heuristic); pre-validation checklist (vs. rule-based pre-checks). Ground truth's recs invent specifics (e.g., "€25 k," "peak morning window," "external score retrieval," "35% reduction") absent from data, but evaluation prioritizes alignment to ground truth—complete mismatch in content and phrasing leads to heavy loss. LLM's are more rule-compliant (no inventions) but irrelevant for grading against ground truth.

- **Overall Fidelity and Word Count (~150 words)**: LLM is concise (~160 words) and sticks to provided data without extras (e.g., no invented dates like "April 2025" or unsubstantiated projections). Returns only memo text, as instructed. However, pervasive content differences (order, invented metrics, rec wording) outweigh this, especially since recs are a core prompt element. Strictness amplifies: even derived percentages and order swap = notable errors. No criminal/jailbreak issues.
