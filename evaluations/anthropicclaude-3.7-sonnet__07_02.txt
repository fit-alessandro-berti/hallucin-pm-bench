5.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the exclusive-to-inclusive gateway type change), aligning with the ground truth's factual content. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs significant point deductions for multiple violations and deviations:

- **Added tasks (partial match, -1.5 points)**: Lists the correct three tasks (IDs match), but uses descriptive phrases (e.g., "A new identity verification step added at the beginning") instead of sticking to concise names/IDs as in ground truth. The phrase "(replacing the previous Task_RejectLoan)" for Task_FinalReject incorrectly implies a replacement logic, blending categories and exceeding the strict summary requirement.

- **Removed tasks (partial match, -1.0 points)**: Correctly identifies the single task, but adds interpretive text ("Removed and replaced by Task_FinalReject"), which is not in the ground truth and violates the separation of categories by suggesting linkage.

- **Gateway-type changes (partial match, -2.0 points)**: Correctly notes the type change (exclusive to inclusive), but includes extraneous details: logic explanation ("selecting exactly one path to potentially selecting multiple paths"), name change ("from 'Eligible?' to 'Eligibility Check'") which explicitly ignores cosmetic renamings per the prompt, and structural info (three outgoing paths) that falls outside "gateway-type changes" (e.g., Exclusive â†’ Inclusive) and into unrequested flow analysis.

- **Overall structure and extras (-1.0 points)**: Adds an unnecessary title ("# Process Changes Analysis"), uses inconsistent formatting (bullets vs. ground truth's numbered list with bold names), and introduces interpretive summaries that inflate beyond the prompt's "strictly under the three requested headings" for a minimal, non-explanatory list. No other changes (e.g., flow additions) are fabricated, but the fluff dilutes precision.

Base score for core accuracy: 8.0. Total deductions: -5.5 for small but numerous errors (extras, violations, non-conciseness), resulting in 5.5. A perfect match would require exact minimalism without any additions.
