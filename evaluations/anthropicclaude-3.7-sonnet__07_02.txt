7.5

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three added tasks and the removed task, matching the ground truth.
- For gateway-type changes, it also notes the exclusive→inclusive change and describes the semantics, which is acceptable, although the description is a bit more verbose than ideal (but not penalizable).
- Minor issue: The LLM says “Task_FinalReject - A new final rejection task (replacing the previous Task_RejectLoan),” but "replacing" involves a judgment; the prompt asks to **ignore** anything not clearly structural, and the wording isn't as strictly neutral as the ground truth.
- The LLM notes "The gateway name also changed...", but the prompt says to ignore cosmetic renamings, so mentioning this is an error (minor, but present).
- The descriptions “the gateway now has three outgoing paths instead of two, allowing for more decision options” go a bit beyond the requirements (and one could see this as exceeding the prompt, which asked strictly for type changes and not path count). Not major, but not strictly compliant.
- In terms of formatting, the answer doesn't separate task names and technical IDs with both forms (name and ID), though it lists both for added/removed tasks. However, the ground truth includes both, and for one added task ("Task_RequestDocs") only the ID (no description) is given, while the LLM always pairs name and ID. This is a minor mismatch.

In sum, the LLM output is substantially correct, but minor deviations from strictness (unwarranted rationale, mentioning gateway renaming, slight over-description) result in a loss of points. According to the guidelines (“also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points”), this answer should not be scored above 8. A 7.5 is justified.
