### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deviations, ~40% of Score Impact)**: The LLM identifies 4 decision points, but the ground truth specifies exactly 3, with precise branching logic (e.g., eligibility rejection, amount threshold post-pre-approve, and combined final approval across pre-approve/auditor). The LLM incorrectly splits approvals (treating pre-approve as a standalone approve/reject, separate from auditor), adds an extraneous "decision" at Process_Refund_Payment (which is execution, not a decision per the process description), and omits the integrated "final payment approval" logic. Descriptions are overly simplistic and do not match the ground truth's outcomes (e.g., no mention of "claim rejected/returned" or process ending without payment). This introduces inaccuracies and structural mismatches, warranting severe deduction under strict criteria.

- **Required Documents (Major Incompleteness, ~50% of Score Impact)**: The prompt requires a **complete list of all required documents**, but the LLM fragments them across decision points (listing only 5: FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization) without a consolidated summary. It entirely omits two core artefacts explicitly defined in the process (RefundRequestForm from step 1, and RefundConfirmationPDF from step 6), which are essential to the full catalogue. The ground truth explicitly includes all 7, noting conditionality for AuditTrail. This is a critical failure in completeness and adherence to the prompt's dual structure (decisions + full list), treated as a significant error.

- **Overall Adherence and Strictness Penalties (~10% of Score Impact)**: The LLM's response is concise but deviates from the ground truth's tabular/separate-list format without justification, potentially implying non-standard artefacts (e.g., implying BankTransferAuthorization as a "receipt" trigger). No introduction of undefined elements, which avoids worse penalties, but small phrasing errors (e.g., "accept or reject" vs. ground truth's "eligible/not eligible") compound the issues. Total alignment is low (~35-40%), justifying a low score despite partial coverage of some decisions/documents.
