The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately justifies the two violated rules (2 and 3) with precise event citations, matching the ground truth on these critical points. However, it deducts points for incompleteness: it fails to address or justify the satisfied rules (1, 4, and 5), which the ground truth comprehensively covers as part of a full audit. This omission, while not altering the conclusion, represents a structural difference and lack of thoroughness expected from a "senior process-audit bot," warranting a significant but not total deduction under strict evaluation criteria. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., not specifying "distance = 3" for Rule 3) further contribute to the loss.
