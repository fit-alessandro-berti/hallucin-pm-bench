7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the ground truth in content and order. However, it loses points for stylistic and formatting deviations under strict evaluation: unnecessary introductory sentence restating the focus; added contextual details (e.g., "after 'Receive_Stock'") not present in the ground truth; different labeling ("First Parallel Split" vs. "Set 1 – first parallel block"); use of bullet points and italics instead of the ground truth's backticks and ‖ symbol; and an concluding sentence ("These are the two sets...") that slightly differs from the ground truth's explicit "No other tasks..." closure. These small but multiple mismatches reflect unnecessary elaboration and non-exact replication, warranting a significant deduction from a perfect score.
