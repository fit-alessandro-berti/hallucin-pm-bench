7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid counterexample from case C003 where Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order, accurately noting the timestamps. However, under utmost strictness: (1) it incorrectly describes this as "the third event for case C003" (lines 6-7 are actually the first and second events for C003, a factual error); (2) it fails to cite line numbers explicitly as instructed/preferred in ground truth, relying only on case ID and times; (3) it omits the second key counterexample from ground truth (C005, where Validate_Payment in line 11 has no preceding Receive_Order at all); (4) phrasing violates "Answer **“Yes” or “No” only**, then justify" by embedding extra words ("No, the stated fact is not accurate"); (5) justification is less comprehensive than ground truth's two examples proving "not always." These differences and small errors warrant significant deductions from a perfect score.
