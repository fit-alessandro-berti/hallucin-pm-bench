The LLM answer accurately lists all functional changes: all three added tasks, the one removed task, and both gateway type changes are correctly identified. However, it fails to use bullets and does not precisely match the style (dash/bullet for each entry, and aligns differently with spacing). The gateway entries lack spacing after the colon and do not align the ids as in the ground truth. These formatting errors are significant according to the strict criteria, causing the loss of 2 points despite the content being correct.
