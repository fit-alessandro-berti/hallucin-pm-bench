The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with precise IDs, names, and gateway type transitions, matching the ground truth content verbatim. However, it deviates in formatting by omitting the bullet points ("- ") used in the ground truth for all list items across sections (6 total omissions), and lacks the alignment spaces after the colon in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" vs. "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel"). These small but consistent formatting discrepancies result in a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria, preventing a perfect score despite flawless substantive accuracy.
