**8.0**

Q1-Q4 match the ground truth exactly (perfect). Q5 includes all correct activities but erroneously adds "Quality_Check" (which is the first event in case C-77), making the list incorrect. Under utmost strictness, this factual error in one question (one extraneous item in an otherwise near-identical list) warrants a significant deduction of 2.0 points from a perfect score. The JSON structure and other values are flawless.
