**9.5**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in assessment (correct "No", all rules correctly evaluated with matching reasoning), references every rule explicitly, and provides a concise justification. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: bullet-list format vs. markdown table; slight phrasing variations (e.g., "exactly once" explicitly vs. implied; "not compliant with ruleset R" vs. "non-compliant"; no ✔/❌ symbols); and opening "**No**" vs. "**No – the trace is not compliant.**". No factual errors, but utmost strictness on presentation/wording differences warrants a small loss from perfect.
