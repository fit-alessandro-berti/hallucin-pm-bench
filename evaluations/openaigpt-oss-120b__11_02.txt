9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly aligned with the ground truth in structure (memo format, subject line, concise length ~180 words vs. ground truth ~150), core content (identical selection of three worst activities: Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), explanations (tied strictly to table metrics like wait times, processing times, rework rates, SLA breaches, and variability), and recommendations (concrete, data-driven actions focused on automation/digital tools with measurable goals). Both avoid hallucinations, reference only table data, and include a high-level impact summary.

Minor deductions for strictness:
- **Approximations vs. exact figures** (e.g., "≈150 min" and "≈22%" vs. ground truth's bolded exact "150 min" and "22 %"): This introduces slight imprecision (-0.5 points).
- **Omission of key metric in Review_Documents explanation**: LLM focuses on processing/stdev/SLA/rework but skips the 30 min wait time (second-highest overall, explicitly noted in ground truth as contributing to underperformance) (-0.5 points).
- **Projections differ slightly**: LLM's ">30% end-to-end time shrink" vs. ground truth's "≈10% throughput lift, >40% SLA reduction" – both speculative but not directly table-derived, though minor as prompt emphasizes actions over summaries (-0? but noted for completeness).

No major errors (e.g., wrong activities, invented data, or exceeding word limit). Overall fidelity is excellent, warranting a high score despite nitpicks.
