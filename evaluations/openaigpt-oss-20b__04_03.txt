The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses Rules 1, 2, and 3 with matching justifications. However, it significantly errs on Rule 4 by incorrectly deeming it violated due to a consequential interpretation of Rule 3's timing issue, whereas the ground truth correctly marks Rule 4 as satisfied (CC follows NA and VP as required, independent of NA's premature execution). This misrepresentation of rule independence introduces a notable factual inaccuracy, warranting a deduction despite the strong alignment on the primary violation. The format (bullets vs. table) is a minor stylistic difference with no impact.
