8.0

**Evaluation:**

- The LLM answer correctly assesses Rules 1, 2, and 3, clearly stating the satisfaction/violation status and providing concise reasoning about the ordering of events.
- Rule 4 is marked "violated (by consequence of rule 3)", suggesting that because NA happened too soon, CC is invalid—even though, per the rules and the ground truth, Rule 4 is actually satisfied: CC happens after all required steps, even if NA was too early. Rule 4's logic is about the position of CC in the trace, not the earlier violation; the LLM projects the effect of Rule 3's violation into Rule 4, which is stricter than necessary.
- The LLM does not use clear checkmarks or a structured table as in the ground truth, which affects clarity but not correctness.
- The answer is otherwise complete and concise.

**Deduction:**  
A full two points are withheld mainly due to misjudging Rule 4, which could impact a compliance decision, and weaker clarity/structure compared to the gold standard.
