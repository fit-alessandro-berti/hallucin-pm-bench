9.5

The LLM answer adheres closely to the prompt: it correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h p95; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quotes figures verbatim, stays under 150 words (138), includes one concrete, data-driven action per activity promising ≥20% reduction (30%, 25%, 20%), and avoids any discussion of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities. Actions are logically tied to waiting issues without unsupported inventions.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for structural differences from ground truth (full memo headers vs. concise list format) and divergent but equally valid actions (e.g., portal automation vs. reminders; digital e-delivery vs. e-signature; fast-track routing vs. pre-classification), plus added intro/closing sentences not in ground truth. No other errors.
