**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1 (Yes)**: Correct (+2.0 points).
- **Q2**: Fundamentally flawed (-7.0 total deduction):
  - Invalid sequence "T5 → T3": T5 cannot fire from M0 ({P0}); requires prior firings to reach {P2, P5}. After T5, P2 is *consumed*, disabling T3 forever (contradicts LLM's "P2 is available").
  - Fails to provide any valid path/sequence to {P2, P5} without T3 (e.g., omits T1→T2→T7→T4).
  - No markings or proof T3 unfired.
  - Ignores T5 precedence properly demonstrated only via specific path.
- Minor: Unstructured response, ignores word limit structure. Huge errors outweigh partial insight on {P2, P5}.
