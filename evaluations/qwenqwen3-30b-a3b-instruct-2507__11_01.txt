8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes all waiting-time figures verbatim from the table, avoids any discussion of service time, throughput, or extraneous activities, and stays under 150 words (approx. 110 words). The memo format is professional with an appropriate header, aligning with the "executive memo" request.

However, strict evaluation reveals differences from the ground truth: 
- Actions differ in specifics (e.g., LLM suggests "automate document-acknowledgment tracking" vs. ground truth's "automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation"; similar for others), reducing similarity.
- Actions are concrete and logically tied to waiting-time reductions but lack the ground truth's explicit "data-driven" elements (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%"), which invent supportive data for ≥20% cuts—LLM implies but does not quantify per action as precisely.
- Minor additions like the date and closing sentence are unnecessary and diverge from the ground truth's concise structure, warranting point deductions for exactness.

Overall, high correctness but penalized for action variances and less emphatic data backing (1.5-point loss from 10.0).
