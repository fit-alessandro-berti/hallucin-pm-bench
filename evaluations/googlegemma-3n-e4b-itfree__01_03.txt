3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, focusing on fidelity to the prompt's process description. Differences in content, completeness, accuracy, and structure result in a low score due to multiple significant errors and omissions. Below, I detail the issues part by part.

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- **Ground Truth**: Identifies exactly 2 decision points (gates/conditional branches): (1) the risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check, with precise rule phrasing ("Low or Medium *and* ≤ €250 000" → bypass Manual-Underwriting-Review), and (2) the TriVote gate, emphasizing advancement only on at least two "Approve" records from the three specific roles.
- **LLM Issues**:
  - Incorrect number: Lists 4 items instead of 2, inflating the count by including non-decision steps (e.g., "Assign-Deck-Reviewer" is a routine assignment, not a gate/branch; "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" is a computation step, not a decision point itself—the decision follows it).
  - Incomplete/Imprecise Descriptions:
    - The "Conditional Skip" is mostly accurate but lacks the ground truth's exact structure (e.g., no explicit "bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise proceeds") and ties it loosely without referencing the post-risk-check position.
    - TriVote: Close on the "at least two out of three" rule but omits the "record 'Approve'" nuance and the process's "requires approvals from all three" setup leading to the "any two suffice" outcome; phrasing is casual ("the loan's approval requires") vs. ground truth's precise "may advance only when."
  - No adherence to "one sentence each" strictly—some are fragmented.
- **Impact**: Major deviation in identifying and describing "every decision point"; extraneous content and lack of precision warrant severe deduction (~4 points lost for structure/content mismatch).

#### Part (b): Documents
- **Ground Truth**: Lists all 9 required documents explicitly in first-appearance order: Form 14B (step 1), Scorecard–Cyan/Magenta/Yellow (step 3 inputs), Deck Memo (step 5), Offer Sheet 77 (step 7), Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8), ID Matrix Declaration (step 8), Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9). Emphasizes no hallucinations like KYC/AML.
- **LLM Issues**:
  - Incomplete List: Only 5 items vs. 9, omitting 4 critical ones (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow as explicit inputs/documents in step 3; treats "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as implied under "Offer Sheet 77" but fails to list it separately in step 8).
  - Order and Specificity Errors:
    - Misses scorecards entirely, despite them being "Inputs" (and thus documents) first appearing in step 3— a core oversight, as they are integral to the Tri-Color-Risk-Check.
    - Step 8: Lists only "ID Matrix Declaration" but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (distinct from the unsigned version in step 7), underrepresenting the "Documents" plural.
    - No bolding or exact formatting match (ground truth uses concise, unbolded names with numbering).
  - No hallucinations added (positive), but omissions are equivalent to factual errors in completeness.
- **Impact**: ~50% of documents missing, directly contradicting "all documents... in the order they first appear"; strictness demands near-perfect recall, leading to heavy deduction (~3.5 points lost for omissions/incompleteness).

#### Overall
- Strengths: No fabricated elements (e.g., no KYC mentions); core rules in a) are partially captured; logical structure attempted.
- Weaknesses: Fails completeness (especially documents) and precision (decision points); small phrasing/order errors compound to show misunderstanding of the process. Total score reflects ~70% deviation, penalized harshly per instructions. A perfect match would be 10.0; this is far from it.
