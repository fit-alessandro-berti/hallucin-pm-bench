4.0

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision Points:**
- The LLM answer introduces extraneous items as "decision points" that are not gates or conditional branches per the process definition: namely, "Assign-Deck-Reviewer" and "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" are not actual process decision points but regular steps.
- The only two real decision points per the process are the risk/amount conditional branch (whether to skip Manual-Underwriting-Review) and the TriVote approval gate. Only #3 and #4 in the LLM's list align with this, and of those, only #3 is strictly accurate in wording.
- Both ground truth decision rules are not precisely worded in the LLM answer. For example, "Conditional Skip" does not specify it relates to skipping Manual-Underwriting-Review, and is not as precise as required; "Decision-Gate 'TriVote'" is accurate in saying "at least two out of three", but does not reiterate that all three must participate by design and the ground truth formulation is clearer.
- LLM answer is not sufficiently concise or explicit regarding what is being gated, as the ground truth is.

**b) Required Documents:**
- The LLM omits three crucial documents: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow, and also misses out on "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (only listing "Offer Sheet 77" and "ID Matrix Declaration" with no mention of the signed variant as required at applicant confirmation).
- The order is correct for those listed, but the answer is severely incomplete—omitting almost half of the expected required documents.
- Importantly, nothing hallucinated (bonus), but incompleteness is an objective, major error.

**Summary:**  
- Serious missed details present in both parts a) (only two required decision points, both incompletely and imprecisely expressed) and b) (omits four required documents).
- No explicit hallucinations.
- Score is drastically reduced for incompleteness, lack of precision, and deviation in both scope and terminology. 

**Rationale for 4.0:**  
The answer partially identifies the main gates and the correct process order for the listed documents but omits several required items and gives imprecise/incomplete explanations for the actual decision points, reflecting large and multiple compliance gaps with the ground truth.
