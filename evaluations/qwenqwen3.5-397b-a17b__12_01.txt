9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Correct verdict ("inaccurate"). Covers all three cases with precise evidence (timestamps equivalent to line citations for verification). Notes reverse order in 1001/1003 and absence in 1002, directly refuting "always." Short, evidence-based justification citing case IDs/activities/timings as prompted. No guessing or extras; strictly data-based.
- **Weaknesses (deductions for differences, per strict criteria)**:
  - Structure/phrasing not identical: Lacks "Short verdict" header and final precise summary ("in none... immediately precede"); instead uses looser "reverse order... contradicting." (-0.4)
  - Case order altered (1001→1003→1002 vs. sequential 1001→1002→1003). (-0.2)
  - Absence in 1002 not explicitly tied to disproving "always" (ground truth does); implied but not spelled out. (-0.1)
  - No line citations (uses timestamps—equally/more precise, but differs). (-0.1)
- No factual errors, fabrications, or omissions of key counterexamples. Minor stylistic/nuance gaps prevent perfect 10.0 under utmost strictness.
