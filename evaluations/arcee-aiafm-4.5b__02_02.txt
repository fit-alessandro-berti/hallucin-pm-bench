4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth (3 distinct cases: C001, C002, C003). Full credit.
- **Q2**: Major omissions; LLM identifies only the first two activities (Receive_Order → Check_Stock) but misses the last two (Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order) from events 8 and 10 for case C002. This is a factual error equivalent to ~50% incompleteness, treated strictly as a significant partial failure (partial credit for correct portion only).
- **Q3**: Complete hallucination and mismatch; LLM fabricates a nonsensical list (e.g., "Arranged", "Checked", "Delivered") unrelated to the log, failing to identify the correct distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock). No alphabetical ordering of actual items. Zero credit for factual inaccuracy and fabrication.
