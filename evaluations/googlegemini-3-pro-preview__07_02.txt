9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying all added tasks (3 items), the single removed task, and the precise gateway-type change (exclusive to inclusive, with XOR/OR notation). It adheres strictly to the three required headings and ignores non-relevant changes (e.g., renamings, flows, cosmetic details) as instructed. No factual errors or omissions.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting inconsistencies** (significant deduction: -0.5): Uses bullets (•) instead of numbered lists (1., 2., 3.); lacks bolding on task/gateway names (e.g., **Verify Identity** vs. plain "Verify Identity"); uses backticks and colon in gateway description vs. ground truth's bolded, escaped underscore and "changed from... in *v1* to... in *v2*".
- **Wording variations** (moderate deduction: -0.2): "Exclusive Gateway (XOR)" vs. "exclusive (XOR)" (capitalization and expansion); extra introductory sentence ("Here is the summary...") not in ground truth; missing closing note "(No other... are present.)", though not strictly required.
- **Overall structure** (minor deduction: -0.1): Headings match exactly, but ground truth uses "## **Expected Answer Key**" as a wrapper, which LLM omits.

These are small but reflect differences, warranting deductions from a perfect 10.0. The answer is otherwise exemplary and directly responsive.
