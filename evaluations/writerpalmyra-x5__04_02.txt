7.0

The LLM answer is mostly accurate but has a critical error on R2 (incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated, with wrong justification missing the new Manager_Approval #8 as the last required approval due to R5 interaction). Status correct on R1, R3–R6; justifications close except R2 and minor incompleteness on R5 (omits Pay_Invoice). Format matches instructions perfectly; overall result correct. Strict deduction for major R2 error (-3.0).
