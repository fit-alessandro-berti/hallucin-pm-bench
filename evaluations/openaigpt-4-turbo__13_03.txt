**6.5**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Part 1 (Count)**: Correct ("once" ≡ "1"). Matches exactly on fact. +5/5.
- **Part 2 (Explanation)**: Under 120 words ✓. Captures small sample (3 cases) but generic ("limited data set", "unrepresentative"). Misses ground truth's key specifics: 14 events/<2 hours; frequency swing (0%-7%); wide confidence interval; rare-event sampling error; **exact near-synonyms** ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") risking fuzzy matching errors; data-driven recommendation for random slice. Introduces mild speculation ("process routes...case characteristics") vs. data-strict GT. Shallow/departs significantly on precision/depth. +1.5/5.

**Total**: Substance accurate but explanation lacks GT's rigor/nuance → major deductions per strict criteria.
