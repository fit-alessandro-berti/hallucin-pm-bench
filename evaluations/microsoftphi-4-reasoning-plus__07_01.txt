The LLM answer correctly identifies the key differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), which aligns with the ground truth in substance. However, it fails significantly in format and adherence to instructions: it includes extensive extraneous reasoning and XML restatements instead of providing a clean, direct summary under the exact headings as required ("list **only** the factual differences"). Task listings use only IDs (e.g., "check_vip") rather than incorporating the exact element details like names and IDs as in the ground truth (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)*"), which deviates from "use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML." Formatting is inconsistent and mismatched (â€¢ for headings, - for items, no bolding or structured italics/backticks). No "(none)" for empty categories (though not needed here), and lacks the ground truth's precise phrasing for the gateway change (missing "(v1) to (v2)" specification) and closing note. These errors, including the pollution with non-output content, warrant a low score despite factual accuracy.
