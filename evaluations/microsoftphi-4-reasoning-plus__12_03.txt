The LLM answer demonstrates careful, step-by-step analysis, correctly arrives at "No," and gives case-specific justifications for C002 and C004, explicitly listing the event sequences that show violations of the stated rule. The answer also correctly points out that the presence of even one contradicting case is sufficient to falsify the "always" assertion, and the answer is clear and well-structured.

**Where the LLM answer falls short compared to the ground truth (costing 2 points):**
- **No concise summary table:** The LLM does not present the case-by-case findings in a table, as the ground truth answer does. The table format provides a more rigorous, systematic, and easily scannable breakdown.
- **Inconsistent format:** The LLM's justification is somewhat less systematic than the ground truth, lacking an explicit, parallel check for all cases (including the ones that do conform, C001 and C003). While the LLM mentions C001 and C003 as conforming in its process, it does not summarize this succinctly for the reader.
- **Minor verbosity and repetition:** The LLM answer contains some unnecessary prose ("Wait observation... Actually check... Let's restate..."), which, while showing internal reasoning, dilutes the crispness of the output.
- **Technical clarity:** The ground truth is more explicit in marking which sequences follow immediately and which do not, including "Immediate successor? Yes/No" and supplementary notes.

**However, all crucial evidence is present and correct, and the reasoning is fundamentally valid and justified, meriting a high—but not perfect—score.**
