The LLM answer is semantically perfect, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive → parallel), with no extras, misses, guesses, or commentary, fully adhering to content rules.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Headings deviate from verbatim plain text by adding Markdown bolding (**), violating "verbatim" requirement (3 instances).
- Minor spacing difference in second gateway line lacks GT's alignment spaces after "Gateway_Payment:", introducing a textual mismatch.

These small formatting errors deduct 1.0 point total, as they prevent exact string match despite negligible functional impact.
