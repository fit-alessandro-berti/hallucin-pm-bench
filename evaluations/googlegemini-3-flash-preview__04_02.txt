4.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **R1**: Incorrect status (Violated vs. Compliant) and wrong justification (assumes invalidation by R5, unsubstantiated by rule text). Major error (-2.0 pts).
- **R2**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and wrong justification (ignores new approval post-change as "last required"). Major error (-2.0 pts).
- **R3**: Correct status and accurate justification. (+1.0 pt).
- **R4**: Correct status and near-identical justification. (+1.0 pt).
- **R5**: Correct status; justification similar but adds Receive_Goods (minor overreach). (+0.8 pt).
- **R6**: Correct status and justification. (+1.0 pt).
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). (+0.2 pt).
- **Format**: Close to prompt (bold status + short justification), minor extras (header, ---). No deduction.
- **Base 10.0**, deduct for 2 major rule errors and justifications: final 4.0. Strict per instructions.
