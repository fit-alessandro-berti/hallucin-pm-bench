**9.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" with an identical valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3) and accurate, concise markings that demonstrate T5 firing before T3 while p4=0. The brief justification properly explains enablement via the inhibitor arc and postponing T3, fully addressing the prompt.

Minor differences from ground truth (strict evaluation applied):
- Lacks the extra (insightful but non-required) "must fire before T3 if ever" claim and permanence proof (-0.3).
- Shorter markings (implicit zeros/p6; sufficient but less explicit) and no erroneous T4 step (-0.2).
No factual errors in LLM (unlike ground truth's invalid T4 firing post-T5, where p3=0 prevents it). High score reflects semantic match and superiority on accuracy despite stylistic/presentation diffs.
