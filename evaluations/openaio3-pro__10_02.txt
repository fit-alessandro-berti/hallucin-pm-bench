### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") throughout, avoiding prohibited terms like "Customer Due Diligence" or "Compliance Officer". It produces a Markdown RACI table covering most source tasks, includes a legend, and maps the informal description without inventing new roles beyond the source (e.g., sticks to Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support). Task 3 explicitly uses "KYC Review on sender and beneficiary", aligning with the mandate.
  
- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **Missing Role**: Ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a key column (often "A" for Accountable), which is absent in the LLM answer. This omits a core element, leading to incomplete RACI coverage (e.g., accountability is wrongly assigned to other roles like Transaction Analyst in tasks 1, 2, 5, 6).
  - **Inaccurate Task Structure and Number**: LLM expands to 7 tasks, separating "Transmit SWIFT message" (task 6) and adding "Archive case file and issue notification" (task 7, inventing "issue notification" not explicitly in source). Ground truth has exactly 6 concise tasks, combining release/SWIFT into one and simplifying archive (no explicit notification task). This adds unsubstantiated content and deviates from source mapping.
  - **RACI Assignments Mismatch**: Nearly every task has differences in roles/responsibilities:
    - Task 1 (Receive/Log): LLM assigns A,R to Transaction Analyst (overloading); GT has R to Transaction Analyst, A to Operations Manager, C to IT Support.
    - Task 2 (Screen Sanctions): LLM A,R to Transaction Analyst, C to Regulatory Liaison; GT R to Transaction Analyst, A to Regulatory Liaison, I to Operations Manager, C to IT Support.
    - Task 3 (KYC Review): LLM C to Transaction Analyst, A,R to Regulatory Liaison; GT C to Transaction Analyst, R to Regulatory Liaison, A to Operations Manager, I to IT Support (LLM wrongly makes Regulatory Liaison A).
    - Task 4 (Approve High-Risk): LLM C to Transaction Analyst, A,R to Regulatory Liaison, I to IT Support; GT C to Transaction Analyst, R to Regulatory Liaison, A to Operations Manager, I to IT Support (similar but A overloaded on Regulatory Liaison).
    - Task 5 (Release): LLM A,R to Transaction Analyst, I to Regulatory Liaison, C to IT Support; GT R to Transaction Analyst, A to Operations Manager, I to Regulatory Liaison, C to IT Support (A wrongly on Transaction Analyst).
    - No direct GT match for LLM's task 6 (Transmit SWIFT); GT folds into Release with different assignments.
    - LLM's task 7 (Archive/Notification): A,R to IT Support, I to others; GT's Archive has R to IT Support, A to Operations Manager, C to Transaction Analyst, I to Regulatory Liaison (notification omitted, assignments differ).
  - **Task Phrasing**: LLM uses verbose, near-verbatim source phrasing (e.g., "Receive customer transfer instruction and log it in the system"); GT standardizes to concise, mandated-style titles (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction"). This is a minor but consistent deviation.
  - **Extra Elements**: Unnecessary header ("AtlasRemit â€“ End-to-End Payment Flow") and full legend explanations (GT uses abbreviations). No explanatory note on vocabulary adherence, as in GT.
  - **Overall Fidelity**: While covering the source, the LLM introduces alterations (extra task, missing role, overloaded A/R) that distort the RACI logic, failing strict mapping to ground truth. Small errors (e.g., phrasing, legend style) compound with structural ones for a low score.

This strict assessment penalizes all deviations heavily, resulting in a mid-low score for partial adherence to mandates but poor alignment with ground truth content and structure.
