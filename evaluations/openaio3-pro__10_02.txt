6.0

**Justification:**

*Positives:*
- The LLM answer strictly uses the mandated terms: "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst" — it never reverts to forbidden synonyms.
- The answer correctly reconstructs the process into a RACI table in Markdown and covers all the steps described.
- The structure and legend are clear.

*Major issues resulting in substantial point deduction:*

1. **Missing Role:**
   - The LLM answer omits "Operations Manager" entirely, which is present and used as Accountable for every step in the ground truth. This is a significant governance oversight, as RACI matrices require clear accountability, which is not solely fulfilled by the Responsible role.

2. **Incorrect/Incomplete Accountability ("A") Assignments:**
   - In most steps, "Transaction Analyst" or "Regulatory Liaison" is assigned both "A" and "R" (Accountable and Responsible), whereas the ground truth splits A and R correctly (mostly with "Operations Manager" as A and others as R).
   - For example, "KYC Review" should have Regulatory Liaison as R, Operations Manager as A; in the LLM answer, Regulatory Liaison is both A,R, and Operations Manager is missing.

3. **Task Naming & Mandated Vocabulary:**
   - Some task names do not fully match the mandated activity wording as in the ground truth. For example:
     - "Transmit SWIFT message" is not an exact mirror of any activity in the ground truth, which simply ends with "Archive Record".
     - "Archive case file and issue notification" combines two actions, while the source and ground truth have separate actions.

4. **Extra or Merged Steps:**
   - The LLM splits and sequences steps slightly differently (e.g., merging “archive” and “notify,” splitting IT action into "Transmit SWIFT message"), whereas ground truth is more concise and aligned to the original process.

5. **Consulted/Informed Marks:**
   - There are discrepancies in who is consulted/informed for several steps.
   - LLM sometimes lists "I" or "C" without matching the ground truth — e.g., in "Release Payment," IT should be C (ground truth), but LLM sets IT as C as well as Transaction Analyst as AR, while omitting proper accountability/A.

*Minor:*
- "SWIFT message" is an IT detail absent from the ground truth, introducing potential noise.
- Some wordings ("Archive case file and issue notification") are more verbose than the concise mandated ground truth form.

**Summary:**  
**- Stricter vocabulary adherence, correct task mapping, and especially clarity on accountability are essential in process documentation.  
- Omitting the Operations Manager and misusing AR assignments are major errors.  
- While overall structure/format is passable, flaws listed above are severe enough to warrant a loss of 4 points. Thus, 6.0.**
