**4.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Exact match ("once" ≡ "1"; correct count from data). **10/10**
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Superficial; correctly notes small sample but speculates vaguely ("possible more... other cases") without data grounding (e.g., no "14 events/3 cases/<2 hours", case 1002@09:07:13, frequency swing 0-7%, confidence interval, rare-event sampling error). Ignores critical data insight: near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") risk strict/fuzzy matching bias. Generic, non-analytical; violates "senior process-mining analyst" depth. Word count compliant (78). **-2.8/10**

**Rationale**: Strict per instructions—Q2 has major omissions of ground-truth specifics/insights, yielding high differences despite brevity. Minor phrasing (bold "once" vs plain "1") deducts fractionally.
