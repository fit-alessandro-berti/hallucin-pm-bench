### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correct identification of three worst activities (jointly on SLA breach + high wait)**: Matches ground truth (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment). +2.0 points.
- **Quantification of SLA exceedance**: Fundamentally incorrect for 2/3 activities (Legal: LLM +600s vs. actual/ground +300s; Credit: +160s vs. +60s; Risk correct at +300s). No credit for errors; violates "ground in data" and core task. -3.0 points.
- **Waiting times**: Correctly stated for all three, matching data/ground truth. +1.0 point.
- **Recommendations**: One per activity, but not "bullet points **only** for recommendations" (integrated into numbered list with paragraphs, not isolated bullets). Vague/generic ("investigate root cause," "examine workload") vs. ground truth's concrete phrasing; not strictly data-driven (no table metrics support staffing/automation specifics). Partial credit. +0.5 points.
- **Structure & format**: Fails "return **only** the memo text" (adds greeting, closing, signature, extra summary para). Uses numbered list instead of bullets; includes invented conversions (minutes). Deviates from ground truth's concise header/bullets. -2.0 points.
- **Word count & fidelity**: ~280 words vs. ≈150; unnecessary intro/conclusion. Minor inventions (minutes) compound strictness penalty. -0.3 points.
- **Overall grounding**: Some invention (recommendation details), but less than ground truth's extras (e.g., "€25k," "35%"); still violates "do NOT invent."

Total derived: Starts at 10, deducts for each mismatch/error per strict criteria. Significant losses for core factual/structural flaws.
