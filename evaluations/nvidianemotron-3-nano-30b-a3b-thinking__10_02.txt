**1.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Structural Differences (major deduction: -4.0)**: LLM uses only 2 role columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison), omitting Operations Manager and IT Support present in ground truth. No legend provided. Header lacks "(mandated wording)" phrasing. Last row incomplete (blank cell for Transaction Analyst).
- **Task Coverage & Wording (major deduction: -2.5)**: 8 tasks vs. ground truth's 6. Omits/extras/misnames: Adds "Notify Regulatory Liaison" (not in ground truth); mislabels "Screen payment (KYC Review)" by incorrectly equating sanctions screening to KYC Review (vocabulary violation, as KYC Review is separate per source/prompt); "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" invented assignment but missing in ground truth equivalent; wording not matching (e.g., "Receive and log instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; no bolding on **KYC Review**).
- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -1.8)**: Near-total mismatch. Examples:
  | Task Example | LLM | Ground Truth | Match? |
  |--------------|-----|--------------|--------|
  | Receive... | R/Analyst, A/Liaison | R/Analyst, I/Liaison, A/Ops, C/IT | Partial (ignores other roles) |
  | Screen... | R/Analyst, A/Liaison | R/Analyst, A/Liaison, I/Ops, C/IT | Partial |
  | KYC Review | C/Analyst, R/Liaison | C/Analyst, R/Liaison, A/Ops, I/IT | Partial |
  | Approve... | I/Analyst, RA/Liaison | C/Analyst, R/Liaison, A/Ops, I/IT | No |
  | Release... | R/Analyst, A/Liaison | R/Analyst, I/Liaison, A/Ops, C/IT | No |
  | Archive... | R/Analyst, I/Liaison | C/Analyst, I/Liaison, A/Ops, R/IT | No |
  - Wrongly assigns IT Support tasks (SWIFT, archive) to Analyst/Liaison. Uses non-standard "RA" (not separated as in ground truth).
- **Vocabulary Mandate (deduction: -0.5)**: Mostly complies but violates by applying "KYC Review" to sanctions screening (not mandated/per source).
- **Overall Fidelity**: ~20% cell/task similarity; fails to "cover every task... using *only* the mandated terms... without omissions or substitutions" per ground truth notes. Small errors (e.g., no bolding, incomplete row) compound under strictness.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 1.2 for cumulative failures.
