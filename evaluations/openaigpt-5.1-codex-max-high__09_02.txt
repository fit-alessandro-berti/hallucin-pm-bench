The LLM answer is semantically identical and correctly identifies the absence of timestamps as the reason, matching the ground truth's core explanation in a single concise sentence as required. Minor deductions for phrasing differences (e.g., "can’t be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; omission of explicit "event counts" and "intervals absent" details, though implied; "artefacts" vs. no such term).
