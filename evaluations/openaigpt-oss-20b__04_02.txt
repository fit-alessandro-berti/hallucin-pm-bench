7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Format adherence**: Matches required structure (status + ≤20-word justification per rule; all-caps overall). Minor deduction for not using a table like ground truth, but prompt doesn't mandate it. (-0.5)
- **R1**: Status and justification align closely (correct sequence for high amount). Full credit.
- **R2**: Major error—status incorrectly "Compliant" (ignores post-change Manager_Approval on 03-07 as "last required approval," making Ship_Goods on 03-05 precede it, violating timing). Justification flawed. Significant deduction (-2.0).
- **R3**: Status and justification match (payment before receipt). Full credit.
- **R4**: Status and justification align (not required for non-hazardous). Full credit.
- **R5**: Status correct; justification similar but less precise (omits Pay_Invoice explicitly, though core issue captured). Minor deduction (-0.5).
- **R6**: Status and justification align. Full credit.
- **Overall**: Correctly "NON-COMPLIANT" despite missing one violation. Full credit.
- **Strictness adjustment**: One critical rule error (wrong status + invalid justification) warrants heavy penalty, as it misinterprets rule interplay with R5; small justification tweaks elsewhere noted but minimal impact. Total reflects ~80% accuracy with outsized deduction for the key flaw.
