7.0

Rationale for scoring:

- **R1:** Correct and justification matches ground truth.
- **R2:** Marked as Compliant instead of Violated, which is a major error; the LLM failed to consider that after the Change_Request, a new Manager_Approval resets the approval baseline, so Ship_Goods occurred before the required post-change approval and outside the compliance timeframe. The LLM calculated the time after Finance_Approval, not after the required post-change approval. This is a crucial mistake.
- **R3:** Correct and matches ground truth.
- **R4:** Correct and matches ground truth.
- **R5:** Correct and matches ground truth.
- **R6:** Correct and matches ground truth.
- **Overall Result:** Correct.

**Main deduction comes from the critical misjudgment in R2, which should weigh heavily (at least -2 points) since expedited compliance is a central issue of the case. Otherwise, the format and other rules are handled correctly, with correct justifications and labels for all other rules. Minor deductions for justification wording (R2) not being as explicit about the Change_Request as the ground truth, but compliant with length limits.**

Strict evaluation per instructions:  
1 major error (R2; marked as Compliant instead of Violated): -2  
All else correct in format, judgments, and summarized result: -1 for slight lack of detail/clarity in justifications.

**Final: 7.0**
