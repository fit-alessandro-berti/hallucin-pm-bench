**Score: 9.0**

The LLM's answer is factually correct and directly addresses the prompt's requirements. It correctly states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to lack of timestamp information. 

**Why not 10.0?**  
However, the answer is very terse and omits a crucial detail that appears in the ground truth: that only event counts are supplied, meaning the necessary start-to-completion intervals are absent. The expected answer more fully explains not just the absence of timestamps, but also why that absence (combined with the presence of only counts) makes the calculation impossible.

**Point lost for:**  
- Not explicitly mentioning that only the occurrence counts are available (as noted in the input table), and thus the required data for interval calculation is missing.
  
**Summary:**  
The answer is factually and procedurally correct and concise, but lacks the slight explanatory depth of the ground truth.
