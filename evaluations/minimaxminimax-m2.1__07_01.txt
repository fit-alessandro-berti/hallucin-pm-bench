8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes: the two added tasks (by ID), the one removed task (by ID), and the exact gateway type change for `gw_valid`. No incorrect or extra items are listed, and it adheres to the required headings with the exact bullet style specified (•). 

However, under strict evaluation:
- Task listings use only IDs instead of the full names from the XML `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status"), as shown in ground truth—significant deduction for omitting readable names (-1.5).
- Bullet sub-style uses - instead of * (-0.3).
- Gateway phrasing is concise ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway") vs. ground truth's verbose version with bolding, (v1)/(v2), and "changed from ... to" (-0.2).
- Lacks ground truth's final note and exact bold/formatting (-0.0, as not required by prompt).

Factual accuracy is perfect (10/10), but presentation/details differ enough for deductions, yielding 8.0.
