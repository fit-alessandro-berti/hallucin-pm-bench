5.0

**Assessment:**

a) **Decision points**

- The LLM answer lists three decision points, but only two true decision points exist per the process:
  1. Risk-based skip (after Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
  2. TriVote approval gate
- The LLM lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a decision point. However, the check isn't a gating decision—it supplies an input (risk rating) to the only true branch.
- The LLM states "if risk = Low **or** Medium **and** requested amount ≤ €250 000", but uses "or" instead of the required "and". The restatement in the branch is correct (Low/Medium AND ≤ €250 000), but earlier calls it "Amount & Risk Skip Rule", which is a non-canonical label.
- The explanation of TriVote is correct but could be clearer: "at least two approvals out of... needed for the loan to move on" versus ground truth "at least two of three approvers... record Approve"; minor ambiguity, but core rule correct.

b) **Ordered documents**

- The LLM omits the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are required inputs for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check and clearly listed in ground truth.
- Omits **Signed** Offer Sheet 77 as explicit required document in step 8.
- Correctly includes "Deck Memo", "Offer Sheet 77", "ID Matrix Declaration", and "Loan Dossier 2025".
- Orders are partially correct for the ones listed, but the Scorecards are a major omission.

**Summary of Errors with Strict Grading:**
- **Incorrectly lists Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a decision point** (not a gate, just risk rating selection) — the ground truth does not.
- **Misses key required documents**: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow, and Signed Offer Sheet 77.
- Slight ambiguity in the second decision rule description.
- "Amount & Risk Skip Rule" is not the canonical process term.
- Did not hallucinate extra documents, so no deduction for that.

**Conclusion:** Reasonable effort with partial correctness, but severe omission of required documents and confusing enumeration of gates leads to a significant penalty. Thus, **5.0/10.0**
