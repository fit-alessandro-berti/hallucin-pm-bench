### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and lists all six required documents, aligning with the ground truth's structure and content at a high level. It uses exact activity names from the prompt without introducing standard terminology, which is a strength.

However, under utmost strictness, several differences and errors significantly impact the score:
- **Decision points details**: Omissions include specific underwriter names (Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B), process positioning (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), and precise phrasing (e.g., "for tie-break decision" and arrow-based flow like "⇒ continue"). Wording like "proceed to final approval" vs. ground truth's "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" introduces minor inaccuracies.
- **Required documents**: Inconsistent phrasing across sections—e.g., "Latest Income Statement" in the markdown list omits the clarifying "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" or ground truth's "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes "template" (matching prompt but differing from ground truth's "(CIS)"); "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" adds "old" not in ground truth. The ground truth's explanatory note "(No credit bureau report...)" is absent, though not strictly required.
- **Structure and extras**: Unnecessary additions like "## Summary", explanatory sentences ("Thus, there are three key..."), repeated markdown sections, and the erroneous "\boxed{3}" (unrelated to the prompt) introduce noise and invalidate parts of the response, deviating from the ground truth's concise, focused format.
- **Overall fidelity**: While 80-90% aligned, these cumulative small-to-medium differences (omissions, inconsistencies, extraneous content) reflect incomplete adherence, warranting a mid-range score rather than high. No major factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes all variances heavily.
