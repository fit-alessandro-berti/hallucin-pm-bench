7.5

The LLM’s answer is overall strong: all decision points are identified and labeled with exact activity names (“Underwriter Alignment Gate”, “Amount Threshold Decision”, “Final Micro-loan Board Approval”). All required documents are correctly listed. The order of decision points matches the ground truth, and no unauthorized terminology is introduced.

However, there are a few small but meaningful errors and omissions:

- The description for “Final Micro-loan Board Approval” omits the explicit activity name in its label (“Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)”), though it is mentioned in the paragraph above.
- The document “Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)” in the original prompt is restated as “Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)” for one bullet and just “Latest Income Statement” for the markdown box, missing the parenthetical. The “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” is called just “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template”. Slight deviation from “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” as given in the ground truth.
- In the markdown box, the “Latest Income Statement” and “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” are not specified with the parentheticals, whereas the ground truth specifies “pay-stub/tax slip” and omits “template".
- There is a small typo at the end: “documentsspecified”.

No unauthorized steps, activities, or terminology are introduced. No credit bureau mention or collateral form is wrongly included.

Due to these minor nomenclature and description inaccuracies, and slight sloppiness in document naming details and activity step labeling, a strict score of 7.5/10 is warranted.
