The LLM answer is fully accurate in content, correctly answering "No" and providing a precise case-by-case justification that matches the ground truth's analysis of sequences, violations (C002 and C004), and reasoning for inaccuracy. Minor stylistic differences (stepped bullets vs. table) do not constitute errors, as both fulfill the task's requirements without omissions or inaccuracies.
