The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the ground truth. It focuses solely on Process B and adheres to the prompt's requirements. However, significant deductions for:
- Extraneous title/header ("## Process B – Concurrent Task Sets").
- Different set labeling: "(Parallel Split #1 / Merge #1)" vs. "– first parallel block:" (references specific BPMN elements not used in GT).
- Task presentation: bulleted lists with bolding vs. inline backticked names with ‖ symbol.
- Added explanatory sentences (e.g., "These two tasks are placed on separate branches... after **Receive_Stock** completes"), absent in GT.
- Unnecessary "---" separator.
- Missing closing statement ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel").

Core content is perfect (10.0 potential), but stylistic, formatting, and extra content differences warrant strict -2.0 deduction per instruction.
