The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring Process A as instructed), with accurate alphabetical sorting within pairs (Create_Documentation before Quality_Check; Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines) and across pairs (C-starting pair before P-starting pair). The output format matches the specified "Task_X  â€”  Task_Y" structure, including spacing around the em dash, and lists one pair per line. No extraneous or incorrect pairs are included, aligning with the ground truth rationale that only these two pairs qualify based on explicit parallel descriptions.

Minor deductions for: (1) including unrequested explanatory text before the output (the prompt specifies only the formatted list, without preamble or "Output:" label, deviating from the ground truth's clean presentation); (2) slight misalignment in spacing for the second pair compared to the ground truth's tab-like formatting (though functionally equivalent). Under strict evaluation, these format adherence issues warrant a small but noticeable point loss despite the substantive accuracy.
