4.0

The LLM answer captures the overall flow structure with three exclusive gateways (despite the prompt mentioning only two, which appears to be an oversight as the description requires three decision points) and correctly models the re-work loop from customer confirmation back to "Initial Diagnosis." It uses concise IDs and stays under 40 lines. However, it suffers from significant errors under strict evaluation:

- **Critical structural flaw**: No sequence flow from the "Provide Reset Instructions" task (t2) to "Confirm with Customer" (t7), leaving the password reset path incomplete and the process invalid (dead-end after line 3). This alone warrants major deduction, as it breaks compliance with lines 3 and 7.
- **Unnecessary duplication and deviation from description**: Two separate "Resolve Issue" tasks (t4 for internal, t6 after specialist), instead of merging the specialist path (line 6) into a single "Resolve Issue" activity post-forwarding (as in ground truth). This subtly adds redundancy not implied in the exact wording.
- **Invented elements**: Flow names like "Escalate" (line 5 says "Forward to Specialist") and "Resolve"/"Other" add unmentioned labels, violating "do not invent." No condition expressions (e.g., yes/no as in ground truth), relying on flow names, which is imprecise for BPMN decisions.
- **Naming inaccuracies**: "Classify Ticket" vs. ground truth's "Auto-Classification" (description specifies "automatically classified"); minor but strict policy deducts for inexact matches. Start event name "Customer submits ticket" vs. "Ticket Submitted"; end "Ticket closed" vs. "Ticket Closed."
- **Missing XML completeness**: Lacks XML declaration, targetNamespace, sequenceFlow IDs, process attributes (e.g., name, isExecutable), and proper condition modeling, making it less valid/complete than ground truth while still parseable.

These accumulate to show moderate fidelity but fail exact translation, especially on completeness and no-additions rule. A perfect score requires near-identical structure, flows, and naming to ground truth.
