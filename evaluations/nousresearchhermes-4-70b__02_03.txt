9.0

- The LLM's answers match the ground truth in substance, but the format does not precisely follow the explicit instructions to provide "concise, bullet-point answers only":
    - A1: Not in bullet points, lacks case IDs, and does not spell out the answer (should be "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" or at least "3 cases").
    - A2, A3: Correct and concise, but not in bullet format.
- Even small format deviations matter as per the strictness requested, so about 1 point should be deducted for not formatting as precise bullet points and not giving the full case IDs in A1. Otherwise, content is otherwise 100% correct.
