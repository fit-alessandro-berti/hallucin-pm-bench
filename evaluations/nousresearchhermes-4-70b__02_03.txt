- The LLM answer is correct on all factual points (3 distinct cases; Pack_Items precedes Ship_Order for C456; Cancel_Order appears once).
- Minor deduction for Q1 not explicitly listing the case IDs (C123, C456, C789) as in the ground truth, despite the question only asking for the count; this is a small formatting/content omission under strict evaluation.
