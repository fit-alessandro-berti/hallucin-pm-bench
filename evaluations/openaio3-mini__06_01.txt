9.0

The LLM’s answer is very close to perfect: it identifies both correct pairs and returns them in the required sorted order, each on its own line, using the right format. The only (tiny) flaw is that the spacing between "Procure_Materials" and "—" is not an exact match to the ground truth (only one space instead of five). Since the instructions imply the utmost strictness and say even small errors must lose significant points, this minor formatting error brings the score down to 9.0.
