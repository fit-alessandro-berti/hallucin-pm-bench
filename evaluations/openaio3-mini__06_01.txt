The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs identified (the two correct parallel pairs from Process B), alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and output format (one pair per line with the specified structure). The minor spacing difference in the second pair of the ground truth appears to be an alignment artifact for display purposes and does not constitute an error, as the prompt does not require monospaced alignment. No other deviations or omissions are present.
