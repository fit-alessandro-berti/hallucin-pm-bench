1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1, claiming "No" when the ground truth is "Yes," due to a misunderstanding of the Petri net paths (ignoring the T2-T7 route to P4/P5 without T3). It provides no valid sequence for Q2, instead offering flawed reasoning that contradicts the net's structure. This complete reversal of the truth, plus absence of correct demonstration, warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation.
