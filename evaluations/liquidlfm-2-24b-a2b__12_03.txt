**9.8**

The LLM answer is factually perfect: correct "No", accurately analyzes all relevant cases (C001–C004), cites exact sequences and timestamps from the log as evidence, identifies precise counterexamples (C002: Pack_Items intervenes; C004: Check_Fraud intervenes), and concludes correctly that "always" is violated. Justification is thorough, structured as 1./2., and relies solely on the log.

Minor deductions (-0.2): 
- Stylistic differences from ground truth (bullets/timestamps/conclusion/"Final Answer" section vs. table/✅❌/concise summary), adding slight verbosity not in ground truth.
- No emojis or table, but prompt doesn't require them—still a presentation mismatch under strict diff-based grading.

No factual/content errors; substance matches 100%.
