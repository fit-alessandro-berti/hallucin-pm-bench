The LLM answer is correct, complete, and directly addresses the prompt with a valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, detailed markings, and a brief justification matching the enabling conditions (p3 ≥ 1, p4 = 0 via inhibitor arc). No factual errors or logical flaws.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total, per strict criteria):**
- Lacks ground truth's deeper insight that T5 *must* precede T3 if it fires at all (due to permanent disablement post-T3), and omits explanation of p4's behavior/T4 interaction.
- Does not extend sequence post-T5 (e.g., to T3/T4), reducing completeness.
- Slightly different phrasing ("possible... choosing to fire T5 first" vs. ground truth's "can, and indeed must"), missing emphasis on necessity despite nondeterminism.
- Stylistic differences (full table-like markings vs. compact inline; no bullet-proof structure).

Semantically equivalent for the question (possibility + sequence + brief justification); differences are additive depth, not errors.
