### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1 (Distinct cases)**: Correct number (3), but omits the explicit list of cases (C123, C456, C789) provided in the ground truth. This is a minor omission since the question only asks "how many," but strict evaluation deducts for not fully matching the expected detail (1-point loss).
- **Q2 (Preceding activity for C456)**: Exact match in content ("Pack_Items"), ignoring minor Markdown escaping differences (no deduction).
- **Q3 (Activity appearing once)**: Exact match ("Cancel_Order"; no deduction).
- **Overall Structure/Formatting**: Concise bullet points as prompted, with appropriate numbering. Minor deduction already applied for Q1 detail; no further losses for fidelity to instructions. High score reflects near-perfect alignment, with strictness applied only to the identified gap.
