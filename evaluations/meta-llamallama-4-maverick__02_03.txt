- Q1: The LLM answer provides only the number ("3"), omitting the explicit enumeration of case IDs as requested in the ground truth ("C123, C456, C789"). This is a minor omission but affects completeness and clarity.
- Q2: Correct.
- Q3: Correct.

Overall, small but relevant loss in clarity/completeness for A1. No errors in content or reasoning.
