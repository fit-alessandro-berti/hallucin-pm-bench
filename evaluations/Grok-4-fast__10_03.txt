5.0

**Reasoning:**  
While the LLM answer avoids disallowed synonyms and uses only the authorized activity names, it contains multiple errors and inconsistencies compared to the ground truth. Specifically:

- **Activity names:** The LLM answer properly uses "Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," and "Risk Scoring." However, it inappropriately adds activities not present in the ground truth ("Schedule Payment," "Notify Originating Analyst") and omits "Release Funds" as a stand-alone activity (instead, it splits scheduling/releasing/notifying).
- **Role assignments:** The use of R, RA, A, and I is inconsistent with the ground truth and RACI best practices:
    - "RA" is used, with a footnote equivalence to "R, A" in the prompt, but it is not explicitly clarified here (though it's functionally valid if we are lenient).
    - **Front-Office Analyst** is incorrectly marked only as "RA" (should be "R, A") for "Intake Vetting" but lacks "C" for other activities as per the ground truth.
    - **Release Funds** is present but the role assignments are off (all as "I" except Treasury Ops as "RA"), instead of "R, A" for Treasury Ops and "I" or "C" as GR indicates.
    - Many "C" (Consulted) and "I" (Informed) assignments do not match the ground truth.
- **Extra activities:** The addition of "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst," which are not in the ground truth, represents a major deviation.
- **Activity order and completeness:** Not all activities align exactly with the ground truth (e.g., "Risk Scoring" accountability is incorrectly noted).
- **Formatting:** The matrix is in Markdown and generally matches structure expectations.

**Major point deductions:**
- Inclusion of extra/irrelevant activities.
- Missing or incorrect RACI assignments for several activities/roles.
- Occasional confusion between "R, A" and "RA" (though minor).

**Minor point deduction:**
- "Release Funds" activity does not completely match the ground truth.

**Score rationale:**  
The answer is free of forbidden vocabulary and mostly uses correct activity names, but the deviations in activities and RACI allocations are significantâ€”hence a strict median score of 5.0.
