2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +1.0):** The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, without any synonyms or leaks from the disallowed list. This aligns with the ground truth and policy. However, added activities like "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst" introduce non-mandated phrasings, indirectly violating the "do not add activities" rule.
  
- **Structure and Format (Low, +0.5):** The output is a Markdown table, but it deviates from the ground truth: uses blanks instead of "–" for no involvement; inconsistent abbreviations (e.g., "RA" vs. ground truth's "R, A" with comma and bolding on key cells); extra rows for unauthorized activities ("Schedule Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst"); omits involvement indicators for some roles (e.g., no "I" for Treasury in early activities). This violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities" and fails to match ground truth formatting precisely.

- **Content Accuracy and Coverage (Very Low, +1.0):** Major deviations in RACI assignments across nearly all cells, indicating failure to derive from the process narrative accurately while covering "every activity and role":
  - **Intake Vetting:** Front-Office "RA" (close to "R, A") but Compliance "I" (should be "C"); missing Treasury "I" and Compliance Officer "–".
  - **KYC Review:** Front-Office "I" (should be "–"); Compliance "RA" (close to "R, A") but missing Officer "C" and Treasury "I".
  - **AML Screening:** Front-Office "I" (should be "–"); Compliance "RA" (correct match); missing Officer "C" and Treasury "I".
  - **Risk Scoring:** Front-Office "I" (should be "C"); Compliance "RA" (should be "R", with Officer "A"); missing Officer "A" and Treasury "I".
  - **Compliance Officer Approval:** Compliance "C" (correct); Officer "RA" (correct match); but Front-Office blank (should be "I"); added unauthorized "A" for Compliance (redundant/misplaced) and missing Treasury "–".
  - **Added Activities (Violations):** Includes "Schedule Payment" (R for Treasury, A for Compliance—narrative implies Treasury handles scheduling, but ground truth merges/omits this into "Release Funds" without adding a row) and "Notify Originating Analyst" (RA for Treasury—notification is described but not as a separate activity in ground truth). "Release Funds" has widespread errors (e.g., Treasury "RA" correct, but all "I" for others instead of "C" for Compliance/Officer and "I" for Front-Office only).
  - Overall: ~70% of cells mismatch (wrong roles, missing involvements, or extras). Fails to cover roles accurately (e.g., no "C" or "I" where required) and adds content, contradicting "covering every activity and role described above" without additions. Ground truth key points (e.g., "R, A" notation, "–" usage) are not followed.

This results in a low score due to strict evaluation: correct vocabulary is the only strong point, but additions, structural mismatches, and pervasive RACI errors (even small ones like "I" vs. "C" or missing "I") warrant significant deductions, as they compound to misrepresent the process entirely.
