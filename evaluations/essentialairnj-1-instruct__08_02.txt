**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: Q1 claims "No" (ground truth: "Yes"), with flawed reasoning (e.g., wrongly calls T3 a "prerequisite" that "produces P4 when P2 is present" and "frees up P2"; T3 *consumes* P2 to produce P4). Q2 provides no valid sequence and incorrect explanation ignoring the T2-T7-T4 path to enable T5 pre-T3. Zero alignment with ground truth structure, markings, or logic; violates strictness for even minor errors.
