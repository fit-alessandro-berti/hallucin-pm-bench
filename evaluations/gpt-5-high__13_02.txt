The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1, 2a, and 2b, including calculations and rounding. For question 3, the response is under 100 words (85), directly addresses the single occurrence, highlights instability/variance in statistics and models, and cautions against over-generalization in predictions and KPIs, fully aligning with the required criteria without invention or deviation. Minor formatting differences (e.g., "%" spacing) are negligible.
