The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order, matching the ground truth content perfectly (no additions, omissions, or inaccuracies in tasks or structure). It adheres strictly to the prompt by focusing only on Process B.  

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for stylistic differences under utmost strictness:  
- Descriptive labels differ slightly ("Set 1 (after Parallel Split #1)" vs. "Set 1 – first parallel block"; "(after Parallel Split #2)" vs. "second parallel block").  
- Task presentation uses bullets and line breaks instead of inline backticks with ‖ symbol.  
- Omits the ground truth's closing sentence ("No other tasks..."), though not required by the prompt.  

Semantically identical and fully responsive, but format variances warrant the small penalty.
