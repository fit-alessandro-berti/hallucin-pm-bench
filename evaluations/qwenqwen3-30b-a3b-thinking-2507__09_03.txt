The LLM answer is highly accurate and precise, closely mirroring the ground truth by correctly identifying the redaction of timestamps and data in Artefact A as the core reason computation is impossible, while dismissing Artefact B's irrelevance. It provides a clear, one-paragraph explanation without guessing, as required. Minor deductions for not explicitly naming "standard deviation" and "95% confidence interval" (using the vaguer "this metric" instead of "dispersion or confidence interval") and omitting the suggestion for additional data needs, which slightly reduces completeness against the ground truth's phrasing.
