The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" to Q1 and provides the exact minimal sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] as requested, with a valid explanation under 120 words. It accurately describes the enabling marking {P2, P5} and why T5 can precede T3. However, it deducts points for minor differences: redundant "Yes" phrasing in Q2 (echoing Q1), lack of step-by-step markings for verification (present in ground truth), and slightly less explicit confirmation that T3 has not fired by step 5. These presentation gaps reduce completeness despite factual accuracy.
