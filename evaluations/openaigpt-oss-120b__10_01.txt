7.0

**Justification:**

1. **Vocabulary adherence (No deduction):**  
   The LLM answer correctly uses “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” exclusively, exactly as required, and avoids the forbidden terms.

2. **Formatting (No deduction):**  
   The matrix is clear, well-labeled, and responsive. All roles and activities are present.

3. **RACI Assignments (Major deductions):**  
   There are significant discrepancies between the LLM’s assignments and the ground-truth, notably:

   - **Receive Application:**  
     - LLM: AM = R/A; everyone else = I  
     - Ground-truth: AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = I, IT = I  
     - **Missing:** CO should be Consulted (“C”); LLM omits “C” in all activities.

   - **KYC Review:**  
     - LLM: CO = R/A; others = I  
     - Ground-truth: CO = R, AM = A, FC = C, IT = I  
     - **Errors:** LLM makes CO both R/A (should only be R) and omits AM as A. FC is not Consulted.

   - **Order Vetting:**  
     - LLM: AM = R/A, others = I  
     - Ground-truth: AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = I, IT = I  
     - **Missing:** CO should be C.

   - **Payment Clearance:**  
     - LLM: FC = R/A, others = I  
     - Ground-truth: FC = R, AM = A, CO = C, IT = I  
     - **Errors:** LLM omits AM as A and CO as C.

   - **Record Update:**  
      - LLM: IT = R/A, others = I  
      - Ground-truth: IT = R, AM = C, CO = I, FC = C  
      - **Errors:** LLM omits C for AM & FC, and doesn’t mark CO as I specifically.

   - **Notify Customer:**  
     - LLM: AM = R/A, others = I  
     - Ground-truth: AM = R/A, CO = I, FC = I, IT = I  
     - **OK**

   - **Systematic Issue:** The LLM never uses “C” (Consulted), despite ground truth requiring it in multiple activities, and sometimes misassigns double R/A when only one A per activity should exist.

4. **RACI Key (Minor deduction):**  
   The explanation claims only one “A” per activity, but the LLM assigns “R/A” to a single role per row, implicitly conflating “R” and “A” (sometimes inappropriately).

5. **No unwarranted content (No deduction):**  
   No extra steps, roles, or columns were introduced, as per the rubric.

**Summary:**  
The answer strictly follows terminology and includes the correct activities/roles, but it systematically omits “Consulted” (C) assignments present in the ground truth, makes some “Accountable” mistakes, and occasionally collapses “Responsible” and “Accountable”. Due to multiple substantial deviations from the ground truth’s RACI assignments, these errors merit a minimum 3-point deduction, leaving a **7.0** score.
