4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (strong match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear, aligning perfectly with the vocabulary policy.
- **Structure and Content (partial match, +1.0 point)**: The matrix format is appropriate (activities as rows, roles as columns), with all required activities and roles included. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are added, and there is exactly one accountable party per row. However, the inclusion of an unwarranted title, RACI key, and self-referential note ("All terminology follows...") adds unnecessary content not present in the ground truth, violating the "no unwarranted content" criterion (-0.5 points).
- **RACI Allocations (poor match, -3.0 points total, strict deduction)**: Significant deviations from the ground truth, failing to reflect the process narrative's implied consultations and accountabilities:
  - **Row 1 (Receive Application)**: CO is "C" in GT but "I" in LLM (consultation overlooked; -0.5).
  - **Row 2 (KYC Review)**: AM is "A" in GT but "I" in LLM (-0.5); CO is "R" in GT but "R/A" combined in LLM (-0.5); FC is "C" in GT but "I" in LLM (-0.5). Ignores separation of R and A, and assumes no consultation.
  - **Row 3 (Order Vetting)**: CO is "C" in GT but "I" in LLM (-0.5).
  - **Row 4 (Payment Clearance)**: AM is "A" in GT but "I" in LLM (-0.5); CO is "C" in GT but "I" in LLM (-0.5); FC is "R" in GT but "R/A" combined in LLM (-0.5). Again, overlooks consultations and proper R/A separation.
  - **Row 5 (Record Update)**: AM is "C" in GT but "I" in LLM (-0.5); FC is "C" in GT but "I" in LLM (-0.5); IT is "R" in GT but "R/A" combined in LLM (-0.5). Multiple consultations missed; assumes simplistic "hand-off" without narrative support.
  - **Row 6 (Notify Customer)**: Exact match (no deduction).
  - Overall: 11 cell-level differences across 6 rows, with a pattern of collapsing R/A incorrectly and eliminating "C" assignments (LLM explicitly notes no "C" used, contradicting GT's narrative-reflective consultations). Each small error (e.g., "C" vs. "I") deducts notably under strictness, as they cumulatively fail to "reflect the narrative" with one Responsible and appropriate Accountable roles for AM.
- **Formatting and Presentation (minor issues, -0.5 points)**: GT bolds specific activity names (e.g., **KYC Review**); LLM does not, and uses em-dashes inconsistently. Combined "R/A" notation deviates from GT's separation (e.g., "A" and "R" as distinct entries).
- **Total**: Starts at 10.0 baseline, deducts for cumulative errors (total -7.0). The LLM simplifies RACI into a non-standard "hand-off" model without justification, leading to major inaccuracies despite solid terminology.
