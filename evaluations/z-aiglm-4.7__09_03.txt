**9.5**

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and precision: both correctly identify the absence of data rows and timestamps in Artefact A as the reason metrics cannot be computed, reference the need for start_time/complete_time specifically for "Approve Invoice," and stay within one short paragraph without guessing. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., first-person "I cannot" vs. declarative "Impossible"; "requested metrics"/explicit list vs. "average cycle time nor its dispersion or confidence interval"; no explicit "additional raw log entries required") and slight rephrasing ("specific timestamp values explicitly redacted for privacy" adds "privacy" not in ground truth, though accurate). Under utmost strictness, these small variances warrant a 0.5-point loss from perfection.
