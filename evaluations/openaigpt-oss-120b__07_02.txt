### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core changes (three tasks added by ID, one task removed by ID, and the gateway type change), aligning with the ground truth's factual content. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs significant point deductions for the following differences, which make it incomplete and not fully matching the expected summary style:

- **Added tasks**: Lists only IDs (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity`) without the descriptive names (e.g., **Verify Identity**), which are essential for a proper summary. Uses bullets instead of numbered lists. No inclusion of the exhaustive note "(No other... present.)".
- **Removed tasks**: Lists only the ID (`Task_RejectLoan`) without the name (**Reject Loan**), reducing informativeness.
- **Gateway-type changes**: Uses XML tag names (**ExclusiveGateway** to **InclusiveGateway**) rather than the semantic BPMN terms (**exclusive** (XOR) to **inclusive** (OR)) as in the ground truth and prompt example. Adds extraneous detail "(the ID remains the same)" not present in ground truth. Bullet vs. numbered format.
- **Overall**: Lacks the structured, name-first emphasis, semantic precision, and closing note of the ground truth, treating it more like a raw diff than a summarized analysis. No cosmetic issues ignored, but the output is not "meticulous" in matching the expected format. These omissions and mismatches justify a mid-range score, as the essence is captured but execution is flawed.
