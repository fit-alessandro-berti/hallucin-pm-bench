3.0

**Justification:**  
This answer demonstrates substantial issues when evaluated against the ground truth and the instructions for strict adherence:

**Format Issues:**
- The RACI matrix is not formatted as a proper table; instead, it presents comma-separated values, which makes review and clarity more difficult, although core information can still be found.
- The matrix lists five entries in each row, although there are only four roles specified. This creates confusion over which value aligns to which role.

**Terminology Violations:**
- Mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are used correctly; forbidden terms do not appear.

**RACI Assignment Errors:**
- The assignments deviate sharply from the ground truth:
    - "Receive Application": AM is "A", CO is "R", FC and IT have two entries each, which is a format error. In the ground truth, AM is "R/A", FC and IT are "I", and CO is "C".
    - Multiple entries (e.g., "A,R" or "R/A") per cell in ground truth are replaced by split entries across cells in the LLM answer, which disrupts proper mapping.
    - Many RACI assignments do not align—e.g., for "Order Vetting", LLM assigns AM "A", CO "R", FC "C", IT "I", (extra column?), while the ground truth is AM "R/A", CO "C", FC "I", IT "I".
    - Record Update and Notify Customer show similar misalignments of who is "Responsible", "Accountable", etc.

**Strictness—Penalizing Small Errors:**  
- The presence of extra columns/cells is a major error, not a small one, but even minor misallocations of RACI in any cell are cumulative and significant.  
- Providing both *Responsible* and *Accountable* is required in some cells (as "R/A"), but this encoding is mishandled in the LLM answer.

**No Unwarranted Content:**  
- No extra tasks or roles introduced.

**Summary:**  
Though forbidden terms are not used, the RACI assignments are largely wrong, the format is messy and ambiguous, and critical requirements regarding *Responsible* and *Accountable* roles are not obeyed. Only the terms for the steps are faithfully correct; everything else requires heavy revision.

**Thus, 3.0 is warranted—recognizing the use of the correct vocabulary but penalizing format and core content errors heavily.**
