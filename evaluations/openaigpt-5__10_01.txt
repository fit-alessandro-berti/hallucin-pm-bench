2.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology (positive, minor credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This aligns with the vocabulary policy (+2.0 points base).
- **Format and Structure (major deduction)**: The output is a comma-separated list (CSV-like), not a proper RACI matrix table as implied by the prompt and ground truth (e.g., no Markdown table, no bolding for R/A). Every row includes an extraneous fifth value after the four roles (e.g., extra "I" or "C"), creating invalid columns and parsing errors. No headers are properly tabulated. (-4.0 points; strict deduction for structural mismatch and extraneous content).
- **RACI Allocations (severe deduction)**: Allocations do not reflect the process narrative or ground truth. Key failures:
  - No consistent "exactly one Responsible" per activity (rubric requirement); e.g., "Receive Application" assigns R to CO (incorrect; should be AM), while AM is only A (missing R).
  - Widespread mismatches: e.g., "KYC Review" has CO as A (should be R), AM as C (should be A), FC as R (should be C); "Order Vetting" has CO as R (should be C); "Payment Clearance" has FC as A (should be R), IT as R (should be I); "Record Update" has IT as A (should be R), CO as C (should be I); "Notify Customer" has CO as R (should be I).
  - Accountable roles (e.g., AM as R/A) are inconsistently handled without bolding or indication. Only ~20% of cells match ground truth exactly. (-4.0 points; strictness applied for multiple per-activity errors, violating narrative fidelity).
- **Unwarranted Content (deduction)**: Introduces extra values per row, bloating the matrix without justification. No extra tasks/roles, but the extras qualify as unwarranted. (-1.0 point).
- **Overall Correctness and Strictness**: Despite terminology accuracy, the matrix is functionally unusable due to errors in assignments, format, and extras. Ground truth differences are pervasive (>80% mismatch), warranting near-minimal score per instructions for strict evaluation.
