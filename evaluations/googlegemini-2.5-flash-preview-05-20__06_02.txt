The LLM answer is fully correct. It enumerates precisely every set of concurrently executable tasks from Process B, returning them on numbered lines and using the correct task names and groupings, in the order prescribed by the ground truth. The answer does not mention tasks from Processes A or C, and it excludes sequential tasks as instructed. There are no errors or omissions.
