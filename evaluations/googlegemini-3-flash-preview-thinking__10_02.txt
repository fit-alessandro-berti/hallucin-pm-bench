**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary adherence (partial credit, +1.0):** LLM correctly uses *only* mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without forbidden alternatives; no "CDD", "Compliance Officer", etc. Activities/roles stick to source mappings + IT Support (unmandated but present in source).
- **Structure and format differences (major deduction, -3.0):** Extra unnecessary headers ("Project Documentation", "Prepared by", intro text, "Key" legend with explanations, "***" separator) not in ground truth. Table Markdown but non-minimalist vs. ground truth's clean table + minimal legend/note.
- **Table dimensions mismatch (major, -2.0):** 7 rows vs. 6; columns: "Activity | TA | RL | IT" vs. "Task/Activity | TA | RL | Ops Mgr | IT" (LLM omits invented "Operations Manager").
- **Activity wordings diverge (major, -1.5):** LLM adds details ("Receive and log customer transfer instruction", "(Sender and Beneficiary)", "Ensure SWIFT message transmission", "case file") vs. ground truth's exact phrasing ("Receive Payment Instruction", "**KYC Review**" sans details, "Archive Record", no SWIFT row despite source Step 5).
- **RACI assignments completely mismatched (critical failure, -2.5):** No row aligns fully. E.g.:
  | Activity (LLM) | LLM | Ground Truth (simplified) |
  |----------------|-----|---------------------------|
  | Receive/log | TA R/A | TA R, RL I, Ops A, IT C |
  | Screen | TA R/A | TA R, RL A, Ops I, IT C |
  | KYC | RL R/A | TA C, RL R, Ops A, IT I |
  | Approve | RL R/A | TA C, RL R, Ops A, IT I |
  | Release | TA R/A | TA R, RL I, Ops A, IT C |
  | SWIFT (extra) | TA I, IT R/A | Absent |
  | Archive | RL I, IT R/A | TA C, RL I, Ops A, IT R |
  Uses combined "**R/A**" and many empties vs. separate bolds and full cells.
- **Coverage (minor credit, +0.5):** Covers *every source task* (splits Step 5 correctly), arguably better than ground truth (misses explicit SWIFT).
- **Overall:** Massive content divergence (RACI invention/omission, extra elements, no fidelity to ground truth table) outweighs vocabulary compliance. Strict policy: even small wording/RACI diffs = big loss; here, wholesale differences = near-minimal score.
