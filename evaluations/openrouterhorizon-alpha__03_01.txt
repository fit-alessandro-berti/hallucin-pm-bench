3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the overall process structure, including the start event, auto-classification task, two exclusive gateways, the re-work loop back to "Initial Diagnosis" on customer non-confirmation, and the end event. It correctly models the password reset path bypassing diagnosis and directly leading to confirmation, and the post-resolution confirmation step. However, it introduces a major hallucination by adding an unmentioned "Specialist Work" task (id="t6"), which violates the prompt's strict rule against inventing activities (line 6 only states the ticket is "Resolve Issue" after specialist finishes, with no intermediate task). This adds an extra sequence flow (f9, f10) and inflates the model with 12 flow objects instead of the expected 11, making the XML longer and incorrect.

Smaller but significant errors compound the deduction:
- **Name mismatches**: "Auto Classify Ticket" vs. ground truth "Auto-Classification"; gateway "Resolution Path" vs. "Resolved Internally?" (prompt requires exact translation without invention).
- **Condition expressions**: Uses descriptive strings like "Password Reset", "Other", "Resolve", "Forward", "Confirmed", "Persists" instead of standard "yes"/"no", deviating from ground truth and potentially non-standard BPMN semantics (strict loss for non-exact match).
- **Structural/attribute differences**: Missing XML declaration (`<?xml ...>`); different targetNamespace ("http://example.com/bpmn" vs. "http://acmetech/support"); process id="p1" without name vs. id="support_ticket" name="Support-Ticket"; unnecessary id="defs1" on `<definitions>`.
- **XML completeness**: Both lack explicit `xmlns:xsi` for `xsi:type`, but this is minor and consistent, so no additional deduction.

The output is concise (under 40 lines) with valid IDs and no diagram elements, but the fabricated task alone warrants a low score as it breaks fidelity to the description. With utmost strictness, this is a partial match (core loop and gateways correct, but tainted by invention and variances), hence 3.5/10.0.
