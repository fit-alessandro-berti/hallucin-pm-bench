**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: 
  - Correctly identifies core decision points (eligibility triage, finance pre-approval, high-value amount threshold).
  - Documents list is **identical** to ground truth (all 7 items, correct conditional note for *AuditTrail*).
  - No introduction of undefined activities/artefacts (e.g., no "CustomerService_Agent_Decide").
  - Accurate process order and constraints reflected.

- **Major errors (significant point loss, per strictness rule)**:
  - **Wrong number of decision points**: LLM lists **4** (adds "Payment release gate" as explicit #4, inferring/naming a new "gate" from constraint—not an defined activity or point). Ground truth has exactly **3**. Introduces unnamed "decision" not in process description (violates "do not introduce").
  - **Granularity mismatch**: Splits "finance pre-approval" as separate #2 (not standalone in GT); GT combines approvals into #3 ("Final payment approval at Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review"). Over-separates vs. GT's consolidated view.
  - **Missing explicit outcomes**: No clear "reject/return" paths (e.g., GT's "*Not eligible* → claim rejected"; LLM implies but doesn't state for triage/finance). GT table mandates "Branching logic / outcomes" column—LLM lacks this precision.
  - **Unrequested extras**: Adds per-decision "Basis for decision (required documents)" sub-sections (not prompted; prompt separates "list all required documents"). Verbose headers/subpoints vs. GT's concise table.

- **Minor errors (further deductions)**:
  - Structure/format divergence: Numbered list + sub-bullets vs. GT's **table** (precise columns for logic/outcomes).
  - Wording: "Proceed toward payment (subject to constraints)" vague; GT explicit ("*Approved* → **Process_Refund_Payment** may start; *Rejected* → process ends").
  - No "(No other documents or legacy activities...)" disclaimer matching GT's closing note.

Overall: High fidelity (~80% match) but strict differences in decision count/logic/structure warrant ~3-point deduction from 10.0.
