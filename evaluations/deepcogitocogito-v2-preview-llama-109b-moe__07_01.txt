The LLM answer correctly identifies the key changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change on gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), but incurs significant deductions for multiple violations of the prompt's strict requirements: (1) Uses only task IDs instead of the exact element names (name attributes) from the XML, e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" rather than just "check_vip"; (2) Includes extraneous introductory reasoning text before the headings, violating "list only the factual differences"; (3) Headings and list formatting deviate slightly from the specified "exact headings" (e.g., no bolding, inconsistent bullets); (4) Gateway description adds unnecessary verbosity ("The gateway with id="gw_valid" changed from") without matching the ground truth's concise structure including version references; (5) Omits the ground truth's closing note on no other differences, though not explicitly required. These errors, even if minor individually, compound under utmost strictness to halve the score from a potential full match.
