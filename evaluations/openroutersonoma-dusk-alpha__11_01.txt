7.0

**Justification:**

- **Correct identification and ranking**: The LLM correctly identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities by waiting time:  
  1. Request_Documents  
  2. Send_Closure_Letter  
  3. Assess_Liability

- **Quoting of figures**: The waiting-time figures given for each activity closely match those required, with both average and 95th-percentile (though the LLM sometimes omits the "h" for hours after the number, and occasionally rounds, but mostly matches verbatim).

- **Remedy relevance**:  
  - *Request_Documents*: Automated portals are a plausible action, but justification relies on a fabricated statistic (“86% of delays ...”). This invents data not found in source or ground truth. The action itself, though, is reasonable and consistent with queue-time reduction.  
  - *Send_Closure_Letter*: Automating letter generation is in the spirit of the ground truth but lacks the explicit "e-signature on closure" detail. About "manual queuing" and "templated software," some added, unsupported detail.  
  - *Assess_Liability*: Assigning dedicated assessors is plausible but less precise than automated pre-classification. The justification invents percentages (e.g., "60% of instances..."), not present in original data.

- **Fidelity to instructions**:  
  - The LLM answer slightly exceeds instructions by mentioning "customer satisfaction," "overall efficiency," and provides unnecessary context about the percentages (“86% ...”, “75%...”, “60%...”) that are not in the source data.
  - It mentions "further analysis available" at the end, which is outside the strict instruction to mention only the three activities by waiting time.
  - The LLM does NOT discuss service-time, throughput, or unlisted activities, in line with the prompt.

- **Brevity**: Stays within the 150-word limit.

- **Major deduction**: The use of invented percentage figures and analytical claims not grounded in provided data is a significant error. Small departures from verbatim reporting and not sticking to purely data-driven statements are also penalized.

**Summary**:  
The answer matches on core activities and their rank, and proposes plausible actions. But it loses points for invented supporting statistics and for not quoting waiting-time figures entirely verbatim. These errors, while not catastrophic, are not minor; hence, significant point loss, resulting in 7.0.
