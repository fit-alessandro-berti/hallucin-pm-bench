**10.0**

The provided LLM answer JSON matches the ground truth JSON **exactly** in all fields (Q1-Q5 values, strings, timestamps, and Q5 array contents/order-insensitive). No differences, errors, or deviations detected, even under utmost strictness. The additional reasoning in the LLM response is transparent and correct but not part of the scored JSON output schema.
