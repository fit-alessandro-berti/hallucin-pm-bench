6.0

**Justification of score**:

- The LLM answer correctly states "**No**" and identifies that the statement is incorrect.
- It properly analyzes C004, showing an intervening activity between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".
- However, it **misses CaseID C002**, which is a *critical omission*. In C002, "Pack_Items" intervenes between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment", which further disproves the claim.
- It only contrasts C003 (which aligns with the claim) and C004 (which disproves it), omitting both C001 (which supports) and, above all, C002 (which disproves).  
- Its justification is thus **not comprehensive or fully systematic**, and fails to cite all relevant cases.
- The overall conclusion is correct, but this incomplete analysis and missing evidence represent a major flaw per the grading instructions.

**Rationale:**  
While the answer contains correct logic and partial evidence, **missing even one violating case should cost substantial points** in strict evaluation, as requested. The answer is clear but not thorough, and omitting C002 is a significant oversight.

**Summary grading factors:**  
- Correct Yes/No: +2  
- Clear explanation for C004, partial for C003: +2  
- Omission of C001 (minor, but makes oversight in trend analysis): –1  
- Omission of C002 (major — concrete evidence): –3  
- Absence of a full, systematic, all-cases table: –2  

**Final: 6.0**
