9.0  
- The LLM answer is correct in substance for all three questions: 3 distinct cases, "Pack_Items" for Q2, and "Cancel_Order" for Q3.  
- However, for Q1, it omits the explicit listing of cases (C123, C456, C789) and the word "cases" present in the ground truth, introducing a small but notable difference in completeness and phrasing despite the question only asking for the count.  
- Formatting uses bullets with numbered bold labels, which aligns with "concise, bullet-point answers" but does not exactly match the ground truth's asterisk and "A#" style.  
- Strict evaluation deducts 1.0 point for these minor deviations from the expected answer's detail and structure.
