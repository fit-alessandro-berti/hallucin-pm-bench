The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in stating the impossibility due to the redacted event log (no rows, no timestamps, only headers), the inability to calculate average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval without "Approve Invoice" data, and the precise reason tied to absent concrete valuesâ€”fulfilling the task's requirement for a short, precise explanation without guessing. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., elaborating on normal calculation methods and explicitly referencing irrelevant SLA details, which the ground truth omits for brevity) and not ending with a call for additional data, though these do not introduce errors or deviate substantively from the core explanation.
