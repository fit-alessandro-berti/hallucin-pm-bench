The LLM answer captures the core structure and names the decision points and documents accurately, adhering to the prompt's terminology without introducing standard loan terms. However, it loses significant points for incompleteness and deviations in the summaries: (1) Decision points lack critical contextual details from the ground truth, such as the "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split," specific underwriter names (Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B), the exact position of the Amount Threshold Decision "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check," the "tie-break" phrasing for escalation, and precise flow language like "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" instead of "proceed to MBA." (2) The MBA description omits the bolded **Approve** or **Reject** emphasis and exact voting phrasing. (3) Required documents include minor but strict mismatches in phrasing (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; extra "template" in CIS not present in ground truth) and omit the explanatory note reinforcing no standard documents, which is a key interpretive element. These omissions and phrasing differences, even if small, reduce fidelity under strict evaluation criteria.
