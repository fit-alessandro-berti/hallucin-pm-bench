The LLM answer is mostly accurate and complete, closely matching the ground truth in both the **decision points** identified and the list of **required documents**. Activity names are preserved exactly as required, and no standard loan terminology was introduced.

**Error details:**

- The LLM slightly misses some context for a couple of the decision points, such as exactly where in the flow ("after the Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") these occur, which is explicitly present in the ground truth.
- The required documents section is accurate, though it omits the explicit clarification ("No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.") This is a minor, but relevant, omission for clarity.
- The phrasing for the "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" decision does not elaborate that this is a board *vote* to Approve/Reject; this is a small divergence in detail.

**Strict grading reflection:** Clarity of flow context and explicit mention of exclusions (as in the ground truth) are missing, warranting significant point loss per your guidelines, but overall fidelity remains very high.
