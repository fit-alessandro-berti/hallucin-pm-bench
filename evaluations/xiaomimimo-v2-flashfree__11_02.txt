**6.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), matching ground truth. Concise memo format (≤200 words). Structure lists each with "why" and one action. Actions are concrete and loosely data-driven (e.g., tied to wait/rework/SLA issues).
- **Major Deductions (factual precision failures, -2.5 pts):** 
  - Request_Documents "why": Falsely claims "highest SLA breach percentage (5.5%)" (actual: 2nd; Review_Documents=12.4%). "Triggered by" implies unsupported causation.
  - Initial_Assessment "why": Falsely claims "second-highest SLA breach rate (3.2%)" (actual: 3rd; Request_Documents=5.5%>3.2%).
  - These violate "based strictly on the table" – misrankings are hallucinations, not "factual precision."
- **Minor Deductions (-1.3 pts):**
  - Request_Documents: "Due to second-highest volume (190/day)" – throughput 190 is 4th-highest (Register=280, Initial/Check=270); phrasing implies high volume *causes* wait (opposite of bottleneck logic).
  - Review_Documents: "Causing a 30-minute wait" – reverses causality (wait precedes processing).
  - Extraneous "Next Steps" section + speculative terms (eFNO, OCR) diverge from ground truth's precise, table-tied phrasing without additions.
- **Other Differences (-0.0 pts, neutral):** Actions/recommendations differ but both data-driven; ground truth adds unrequested projections (neutral as it's GT).

Overall: Solid structure/top-3 match (8/10 base), but core "why" explanations have 2 direct data errors + logic flaws = strict 6.2 (not 10.0; small errors = significant loss per instructions).
