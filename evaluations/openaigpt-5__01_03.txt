### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) Alignment**: The LLM correctly identifies both decision points and describes their rules accurately in one sentence each, matching the factual content of the ground truth (e.g., conditions for skipping step 5, and the 2-out-of-3 approval rule for TriVote). However, minor deductions for stylistic/formatting differences (bulleted vs. numbered list with bold titles; mathematical notation "∈ {Low, Medium}" instead of verbal "Low or Medium"; added implication of "fails" not in the ground truth; comma in "€250,000" vs. space in "€250 000"; "approve" vs. precise "record 'Approve'"). These are small but, per strict criteria, warrant a point loss for not mirroring the ground truth phrasing exactly.
- **Part b) Alignment**: Identical to the ground truth in content, order, and listing—no errors or hallucinations (e.g., no improper inclusion of KYC/AML items).
- **Overall**: Near-perfect factual accuracy with negligible omissions or inventions, but strict evaluation penalizes subtle wording and formatting variances. No evidence of broader issues like misinterpreting the process (e.g., correctly notes skip for low/medium risk + amount threshold, mandatory roles).
