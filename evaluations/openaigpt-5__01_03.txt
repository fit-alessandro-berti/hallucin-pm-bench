9.0

**Assessment:**

**a) Decision points**
- The LLM answer accurately identified both required decision points and explained their rules in single sentences. The wording is almost identical (slightly less clear that the TriVote is required at that specific step, but no real loss of meaning). Details such as the names of roles and the required number of approvals are correct and precise.

Minor point off: The LLM answer could have explicitly numbered the points for clarity and exactly matched some phrasing (e.g., “proceed to that review” vs. “otherwise perform it”), but the intended meaning is completely clear.

**b) Documents**
- The LLM lists every required document, in the correct order according to first appearance, and includes all necessary items.
- The LLM also correctly does not introduce any extraneous or hallucinated documentation.

Very minor deduction: The LLM did not separate the scorecards (“Scorecard–Cyan”, etc.) visually from the other named documents, but the order is still clear and correct.

**Summary:**  
There are no substantive omissions or hallucinations; the answers are accurate and sufficiently precise. The extremely slight loss of fidelity to the ground truth’s exact language and formatting is the only minor flaw, deserving only a small deduction.

**Final Score: 9.0**
