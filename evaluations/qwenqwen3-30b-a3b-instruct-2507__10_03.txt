### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms. This is a strength, but it does not offset other flaws.
- **Structure and Format (Major Deduction)**: The ground truth uses a standard RACI format with activities as rows, roles as columns (Front-Office Analyst, Compliance Analyst, Compliance Officer, Treasury Ops), and per-cell indicators (e.g., "**R, A**", "C", "I", "–"). The LLM inverts this, using RACI categories as columns and role names as single entries in cells, which assumes one role per category and fails to handle multi-role assignments (e.g., no support for "**R, A**" on one role). No bolding/emphasis on activities or R/A as in ground truth. This is a fundamental structural mismatch, warranting severe point loss under strict evaluation.
- **Activities Covered (Major Deduction)**: The prompt instructs to cover "every activity and role described" without renaming, merging, or adding. The ground truth identifies exactly 6 activities (the 4 mandated + "Compliance Officer Approval" + "Release Funds", merging scheduling/release logically). The LLM adds 4 extra/renamed activities ("Approval (if Risk Scoring > 70)", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Notification"), exceeding the ground truth and violating "do not add." It also unnecessarily conditions "Approval" and separates "Payment Scheduling" from "Fund Release," introducing inconsistencies not in the narrative or ground truth.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction)**: Assignments differ significantly across most activities, with small errors compounding:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM misses "**R, A**" for Front-Office Analyst (only "R"); wrongly assigns "A" to Compliance Officer (ground truth: "–"); other roles partially match.
  - **KYC Review**: Misses "**R, A**" for Compliance Analyst (only "R"); wrongly assigns "A" to Officer and "C" to Front-Office (ground truth: "**R, A**" Analyst, "C" Officer, "–" Front-Office).
  - **AML Screening**: Mirrors KYC errors exactly (identical mismatches).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Closest match (aligns on "R" Analyst, "A" Officer, "C" Front-Office, "I" Treasury), but still fails to denote "**R, A**" format where applicable.
  - Added rows (Approval, etc.): Completely diverge from ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" (e.g., LLM's "C" Front-Office and "I" Treasury vs. ground truth "I" Front-Office, "C" Analyst, "–" Treasury) and "Release Funds" (LLM separates and alters involvements, e.g., no "C" Analyst/Officer, duplicate "Front-Office Analyst" in C/I).
  - No "None" or "–" handling matches ground truth's dash usage precisely.
- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness**: With "utmost strictness" and "small errors reflect[ing] in significant loss," the pervasive mismatches in format, additions, and assignments (only 1/6 ground truth activities roughly align) result in a low score. The LLM shows some understanding of the process but deviates too far from the ground truth's precise representation, including unrequested conditionals and extras. No key points explanation provided, though not explicitly required.
