3.0

**Justification:**

Major issues exist in both strict vocabulary adherence and matrix structure compared to the ground truth.

**Serious errors:**

- **Additional/renamed activities:** The LLM added/renamed activities (“Approval (if Risk Scoring > 70)”, “Notification”) and merged or split some (“Fund Release” for “Release Funds”; “Payment Scheduling”), violating instructions not to merge, rename, or add activities.
- **Incorrect vocabulary:** The LLM used “Notification” (should be "Release Funds" per the original) and "Approval" instead of “Compliance Officer Approval.” Also, “Payment Scheduling” is not an authorized activity.
- **Structure error:** The ground truth’s table **lists roles as columns**, clearly indicating R, A, C, I for each. The LLM listed matrix with activity as row and “Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed” columns—this is not the format requested, nor does it show explicitly who holds multiple roles (e.g., “R, A”).
- **Role assignment errors:** The assignment of R/A/C/I does not consistently match the ground truth (e.g., for “Intake Vetting”, “Compliance Officer” should not be Accountable; for “Release Funds”, Front-Office Analyst is not Consulted or Informed; etc.).
- **Did not use “R, A” notation** when the same role held both Responsible and Accountable.

**Some positive notes:**
- The four required terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) were present at least as activity names.
- Most synonyms were avoided within the matrix (though not in the activity list itself).

Given the severity of the above errors—especially structure, unauthorized activity names, and misassignment—this answer does not meet the rigorous requirements and merits a 3.0.
