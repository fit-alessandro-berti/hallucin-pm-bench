The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate with a "No" response and provides a solid justification that aligns closely with the ground truth by citing the same key counterexamples: the reversal in C003 (lines 6-7) and the absence of Receive_Order in C005 (lines 11-12). It accurately notes the precedence and lack of the prerequisite activity, proving the "always follows" claim false. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., including an unnecessary timestamp in C003, structuring as a single paragraph instead of bullets with a concluding sentence) and not explicitly stating "counter-examples" or "does not always," though these do not alter the factual accuracy or completeness.
