**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Terminology (strong match, per rubric)**: Perfect use of mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling/capitalization; no forbidden terms. +3.0 points.
- **Structure**: Matrix format correct (rows/columns as specified). Headers use provided abbreviations (acceptable per prompt roles list), but ground truth uses full names (minor deduction). No extra tasks/roles/columns. Bolded key cells appropriately, but added unwarranted RACI key explanation (-0.5).
- **RACI Content (major failures, strict penalties)**: 
  - Every row has 1+ errors vs. ground truth (12/24 cells mismatch; systematic issues like missing **R** in "Receive Application", incorrect **A**/"**R / A**" assignments for Account Manager, missing **C** assignments).
  - Invalid RACI: "Receive Application" has **A** but no **R** (fundamentally broken; standard RACI requires **R** per row).
  - Fails rubric "RACI allocations reflect the narrative" (mismatches process-derived ground truth, e.g., no **C** for CO/FC where specified).
  - Combined "**R / A**" not represented accurately (downgraded to single **R** or wrong letter).
- **Formatting**: Minor mismatches (e.g., selective row-header bolding in GT absent; no "**R / A**" notation). -1.0 total.
- **Overall**: ~50% cell accuracy insufficient under "utmost strictness"; small errors (e.g., **R** vs. "**R / A**") compounded by pervasive mismatches = severe deduction. Baseline 10.0 → -7.0 for content errors.
