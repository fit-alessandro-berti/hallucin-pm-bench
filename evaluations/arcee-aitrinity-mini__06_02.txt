The LLM answer perfectly identifies and enumerates all three concurrent task sets from Process B (P1, P2, P3) with exact task names, correct numbering, no extraneous content, and adherence to instructions (no mentions of A/C, no sequential tasks). Under utmost strictness, it loses 0.5 points solely for consistent minor formatting differences: missing single spaces after each comma in all three lines (1 missing in line 1, 2 each in lines 2 and 3; total 5 whitespace diffs). Content match is otherwise identical.
