8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes: added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`. No incorrect additions, omissions, or speculation. It strictly follows the prompt's exact headings with "•" bullets and concise listing using XML `id` attributes, which align with "element names exactly as they appear" (ids and tag names are direct from XML).

Deductions for strict comparison to ground truth:
- Uses `id` only vs. ground truth's descriptive `name` attribute + `(id = ...)`.
- Simpler bullet formatting and phrasing for gateway (no "changed from **...** (v1) to **...** (v2)", no backticks/bold).
- No final note (though not required).

Semantically identical and faithful to prompt; textual/style differences prevent perfect 10.0 under utmost strictness.
