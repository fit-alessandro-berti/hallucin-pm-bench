5.0

a) **Decision Points**

- The LLM answer incorrectly lists “Manual Underwriting Review: Produces a Deck Memo to be used in the TriVote step” as a decision point. That is merely a process step, not a decision gate.  
- The only two true decision points are:
    1. The conditional skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check (branch depending on risk and loan size).
    2. The TriVote Gate (2 out of 3 approvals required).
- The LLM gives convoluted or ambiguous descriptions of the conditional logic. For example, it says: “Forward to step 5 if risk rating is Low or Medium and requested amount is ≤ €250,000; otherwise, skip step 5.”—which is the OPPOSITE of the actual rule (in the ground truth: Low/Medium + ≤250k skips step 5, otherwise goes to step 5). This is a significant logic inversion.
- There is repeated or redundant tabular presentation; the rules themselves are not succinct or precise.
- The inclusion of details about “Annex P” and “Risk Analysis Appendix” is superfluous and not present in the original ground truth.
- There is surplus introductory and closing prose that adds little value and distracts from the required direct answer.

b) **Documents**

- The LLM does not list “ID Matrix Declaration” in its main list, only as a “+” after “Signed Offer Sheet 77” in one version, but omits it from the main document sequence/table.
- It groups “Scorecards” as a set in the table and sometimes in the list, but is not as explicit as the ground truth in listing each individually.
- The answer mentions “Annex P” and the “Risk Analysis Appendix” as if these are important subsections, which is not pertinent to the process description as required by the prompt.
- Some list versions collapse “Signed Offer Sheet 77 + ID Matrix Declaration” into one line, whereas ground truth lists each as an individual document (as required).

**Summary of Main Errors:**
- Key logic error: **reversal/misstatement of conditional logic in the risk-based skip.**
- Incorrectly identifying a process step (Manual-Underwriting-Review) as a decision point.
- Document list is not fully explicit; a required document (ID Matrix Declaration) is not always clearly provided.
- Unnecessary and distracting extra context/notes/tables.

**Therefore, significant errors exist in both decision logic and document enumeration:**
- Substantial penalty for logic reversal in the conditional branch.
- Penalty for process-step/decision-point confusion.
- Moderate penalty for lack of document enumeration precision.

**Final strict score:** 5.0
