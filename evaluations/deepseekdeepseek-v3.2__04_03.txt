The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying "No" compliance due to the exact same Rule 3 violation, with precise rule-by-rule assessments matching the ground truth's logic and reasoning. All rules are referenced correctly, with no factual errors, and justifications are short and on-point as per the prompt.

Deductions (-0.8 total) for strictness on minor differences:
- Format mismatch: Bulleted list vs. structured table with ✔/❌ symbols (-0.4).
- Phrasing variations: e.g., opening "**No**" vs. "**No – the trace is not compliant.**"; Rule 1 explicitly notes "both appear once" (extra detail not in GT); slight rewording in Rule 3 and closing sentence (-0.4).
