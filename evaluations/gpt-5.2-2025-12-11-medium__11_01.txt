9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities & numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 by avg waiting time correct (#1 Request_Documents 36.5/120.0, #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0, #3 Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4). Figures quoted exactly as table (with decimals preserved; ground truth drops .0 inconsistently).
- **No unwarranted content**: Perfect. Only these activities, no service-time/throughput/executions mentioned.
- **Format & memo structure**: Strong executive memo (To/Subject headers, bolding for scannability, ≤150 words ~110). Ground truth lacks headers, more raw snippet-like. Minor deduction for not matching ground truth's ultra-concise plain style.
- **Actions**: Relevant/logical to waiting queues, concrete, explicitly target ≥20% cut, no unsupported data invention (e.g., no fake "pilots" like ground truth). However, completely different recommendations from ground truth = significant difference (-0.5). All plausible/data-informed (e.g., automation for doc requests ties to high 95p tail).
- **Strictness adjustment**: Minor phrasing diffs (e.g., "Avg wait **36.5h**" vs "avg 36.5 h"; "95p" vs "p95") and action variance cost -0.3 despite fulfilling prompt fully. No other errors.
