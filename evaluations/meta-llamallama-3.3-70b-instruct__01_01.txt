7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer scores a 7.2 due to strong alignment on required documents (near-perfect match, no introductions of extras, and accurate descriptions) but significant shortcomings in summarizing decision points, which form half the prompt's requirements. Small errors, such as imprecise framing of decisions without explicit branching logic/outcomes and failure to isolate the "amount threshold" as a distinct post-pre-approval decision, result in a notable deduction (approximately 2.8 points lost from a potential 10.0). The LLM's list format is functional but less structured than the ground truth's table, and it implies rather than explicitly states rejection paths, reducing precision.

#### Decision Points (Partial Credit: ~6.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Identifies three key areas involving decisions (eligibility validation, pre-approval, and high-value review), aligning with the process flow. No fabrication of activities.
- **Weaknesses** (strict deductions):
  - Frames decisions as activities (e.g., "Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility" as a decision point) rather than summarizing the underlying *decisions* (e.g., ground truth's "Eligibility check" with explicit outcomes: eligible → continue; not eligible → rejected). This misses ~20% of the nuance in branching logic.
  - Fails to explicitly call out the "Amount threshold" as a separate decision point after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**, as in ground truth (#2). Instead, it buries the €1,000 branch within the Senior_Auditor_Review description, diluting clarity.
  - Omits the "Final payment approval" decision (#3 in ground truth), which consolidates approval outcomes across pre-approval and auditor review (approved → payment; rejected → end). LLM implies this but doesn't summarize it distinctly.
  - No mention of rejection/return outcomes in eligibility or final approval, a key part of ground truth's logic—small but significant omission under strict criteria.
  - Overall: Captures essence (70% overlap in content) but lacks the ground truth's precise, outcome-focused summaries and structure.

#### Required Documents (Full Credit: ~9.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Lists all seven exact documents from the process description, with accurate usage notes (e.g., AuditTrail tied to high-value claims). No introductions of undefined artifacts, and the €1,000 condition is noted correctly. Matches ground truth's catalogue inclusion.
- **Weaknesses** (minor deduction): Lacks the ground truth's explicit caveat that AuditTrail is "only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue" and the closing note affirming no other documents/legacy activities. These are small but required for completeness under the prompt's "do not introduce" guardrail—slight polish gap costs ~1 point.

This evaluation prioritizes fidelity to the ground truth's structure, detail, and explicitness, penalizing deviations proportionally to their impact on accuracy.
