8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1**: Perfect match—correct count (1) with accurate reference to CaseID 1002. No errors (10/10).
- **Part 2**: Strong overall alignment in identifying small sample size (3 cases, limited timeframe), naming variability (e.g., synonyms like “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), and risk of skewed prevalence estimates. However, deducts for lacking quantitative depth (e.g., no mention of event count=14, <2-hour span, frequency swings like 0%–7%, confidence intervals, or sampling error for rare events) and overemphasis on qualitative "workflow paths" without the ground truth's strict focus on string-matching pitfalls and statistical unreliability. Minor omissions reduce precision under strict criteria (7/10).
- **Overall**: Concise (under 120 words), non-speculative, but misses nuanced statistical rigor for full fidelity.
