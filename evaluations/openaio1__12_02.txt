The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid counter-example from case C003 with accurate line citations (6 and 7), demonstrating that Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order, which directly disproves the "always follows" claim. However, it omits the additional counter-example in case C005 (lines 11-12), where Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order at all, making the justification incomplete compared to the ground truth's comprehensive coverage of multiple instances. The phrasing "does not hold across all lines" is slightly imprecise, as the evaluation should focus on per-case sequences rather than lines globally, warranting a deduction for thoroughness and precision under strict criteria.
