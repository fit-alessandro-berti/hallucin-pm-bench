### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Perfect match—correctly identifies exactly 1 occurrence (in case 1002). No deductions.
- **Question 2**: Strong on core issue of small sample size (3 cases, non-representative, ~33% implied frequency, sampling bias), staying under 120 words (~70). However, significant omissions vs. ground truth: misses precise details (14 events, <2 hours span, frequency swing from 0-7%, wide confidence interval, rare event error) and crucially, the string-matching pitfalls (near-synonyms like “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. strict/fuzzy issues). These are key reasons for misestimation in this snippet, warranting a ~1.5-point deduction for incomplete coverage under strict criteria. Overall, response is accurate and insightful but not fully comprehensive.
