3.5

The LLM answer misplaces the timer on "Task_RequestDocs" (which activates only after incompleteness check, missing the "complete" path and delaying start from submission), uses an arbitrary 36-hour duration instead of precise 48 hours (PT48H), omits "interrupting" specification critical for bypassing, and introduces unsupported "parallel" document collection not in the model. These errors fail to enforce the SLA across all paths from submission, violating core requirements. Minor positives: suggests a boundary timer and new flow without tasks, under word limit, references an ID.
