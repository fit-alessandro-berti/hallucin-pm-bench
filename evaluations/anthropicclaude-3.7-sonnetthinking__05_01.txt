The LLM answer proposes adding a boundary timer event, which is correct in approach, but it attaches the timer to Task_RequestDocs and triggers it after 36 hours, not 48. This differs notably from the ground truth, which attaches the timer to Task_Receive with a precise 48-hour duration (matching the SLA). Furthermore, the LLM suggests bypassing only the wait for missing documents, whereas the ground truth ensures escalation to triage no matter where the case is stalled after 48 hours. There is no explicit mention of the timer being interrupting. Thereâ€™s also unnecessary complication (parallel collection), which is not in the ground truth. These mistakes and omissions result in a significant loss of points.
