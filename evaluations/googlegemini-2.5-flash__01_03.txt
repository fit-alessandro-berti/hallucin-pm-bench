4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, focusing on factual accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the prompt's requirements. Differences in content, omissions, and phrasing were penalized heavily, even if minor, as per the instructions. The overall score reflects a weighted assessment: part (a) is ~70% accurate but has minor phrasing/structural issues, while part (b) is severely incomplete (~50% of required documents omitted), dragging down the total.

#### Part (a): Decision Points (Score: 7.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Identifies the two correct decision points (the risk-based skip in step 4 and the TriVote gate in step 6). The rules are summarized in one sentence each, as required. Core logic matches: conditional skip for Low/Medium risk + amount ≤ €250,000; TriVote passes with any two approvals from the three specified roles.
- **Errors and Penalties**:
  - Phrasing deviations: Ground truth emphasizes "bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise it proceeds" for the skip (explicitly noting the alternative path), while LLM simplifies to "skipped if...". This omits the "otherwise" branch, reducing clarity on the conditional nature (-1.0).
  - TriVote: Ground truth specifies "the loan may advance only when at least two... record 'Approve.'", highlighting the gating requirement more precisely. LLM's "passes this gate if at least two... grant their approval" is close but less formal and misses the "record 'Approve.'" specificity (-0.5). It also doesn't tie back to "every loan cycle" or mandatory participation as implied in notes, though not explicitly required here.
  - Structure: Labels as "Step 4" and "Step 6" (accurate) but ground truth uses descriptive titles like "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check" and “TriVote” approval gate, which better align with "gate or conditional branch" terminology (-0.5).
- No hallucinations, but incompleteness in nuance justifies deductions.

#### Part (b): Documents List (Score: 1.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly lists Form 14B (first appearance in step 1), Deck Memo (step 5), Offer Sheet 77 (step 7), ID Matrix Declaration (step 8), and Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9) in proper order. No invalid additions (e.g., no KYC/AML hallucinations, as noted in ground truth).
- **Errors and Penalties**:
  - Major omissions: Misses four required documents that "first appear" in the process—Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow (inputs to step 3 Tri-Color-Risk-Check, explicitly listed as documents) and Signed Offer Sheet 77 (distinct from unsigned Offer Sheet 77 in step 8) (-4.0 total for incompleteness; this halves the list from 9 to 5 items).
  - Order/Completeness: The list is not exhaustive ("all documents... in the order they first appear"), violating the prompt. Ground truth treats Signed Offer Sheet 77 as separate due to its signed status in step 8, which LLM merges implicitly (-1.0).
- This is a critical failure in factual recall, warranting the low score despite correct partial listing.

#### Overall Assessment
- The answer is partially responsive but undermined by significant gaps in part (b), which directly contradicts the prompt's "all documents" requirement. Part (a) shows good understanding but lacks precision. No evidence of broader process misunderstanding, but strictness demands heavy penalties for omissions and deviations. If this were a binary pass/fail, it would fail due to incompleteness.
