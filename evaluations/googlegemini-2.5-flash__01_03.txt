4.0

**Rationale:**

**a) Decision points:**  
The LLM’s answer captures the two main decision points and reasonably summarizes their logic, though with slight imprecision. For example, “Manual underwriting is skipped...” is acceptable, but does not specify that otherwise it proceeds to that review—however, this omission is minor. The description of the TriVote emphasizes "at least two out of three required approvers," but stating “passes this gate if at least two out of the three required approvers...grant their approval” is a correct simplification.

**b) Documents (order):**  
This is where the answer loses the most points:

- It completely omits the three Scorecards (**Scorecard–Cyan, Magenta, Yellow**) that are listed as explicit inputs to a step and required for the process.
- It omits **Signed Offer Sheet 77**, which is a required document for the applicant confirmation step.
- The answer lists only 5 documents, while ground truth lists 9.  
- The documents it does include are mostly in the correct order, but misses intervening required documents.

There are **no hallucinated documents** (no KYC, credit bureau, etc.), which is good.

**Strictness:**  
Due to the omission of major required documents, and failure to capture the full set in b), this deserves a substantial penalty; an error this severe warrants knocking several points off even if a) is mostly correct. The language in a) is slightly less precise than ground truth, so doesn’t earn full marks there either.

**Final score:** 4.0
