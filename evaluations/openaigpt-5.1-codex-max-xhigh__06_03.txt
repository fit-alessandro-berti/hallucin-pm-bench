9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Content Accuracy (perfect, no deduction)**: Both identify exactly the two correct concurrent sets from Process B: {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory} and {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}. Correct order, no extraneous tasks, no mention of A/C. No factual errors.
- **Completeness (minor deduction)**: LLM omits the concluding "No other tasks..." sentence (-0.3). While not strictly required by prompt, GT includes it for explicitness.
- **Formatting & Presentation (moderate deduction)**: 
  - Lacks descriptive labels ("**Set 1 – first parallel block:**") (-0.2).
  - Uses plain "and" instead of parallel symbol "‖" (-0.2).
  - No backticks around task names (-0.1).
  - No bolding (-0.1).
  - Minor whitespace/indentation differences (-0.1).
- Total deductions: 1.0 points from 10.0 for stylistic/structural mismatches despite semantic equivalence. Utmost strictness applied to visible differences.
