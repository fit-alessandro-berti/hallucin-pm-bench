The LLM answer correctly identifies and explains that none of the requested metrics can be computed, as all event-log rows and timestamps have been removed. It correctly points out that Artefact B (the SLA excerpt) does not provide substitute data for calculating the cycle time of "Approve Invoice." The answer's explanatory paragraph is precise and does not speculate or draw on outside knowledge. 

Minor deduction (0.5 points): The LLM slightly over-explains, referencing the average "handover time" (which is not directly necessary to state, since the question is solely about "Approve Invoice") and providing a slightly longer explanation than the ground truth. Also, it might have more clearly stated at the very start (in a blunt form) that the task is impossible for the given reasons (as the ground truth does), rather than first saying, "I cannot compute...".

Overall, the answer strictly adheres to requirements and makes no substantive errors.
