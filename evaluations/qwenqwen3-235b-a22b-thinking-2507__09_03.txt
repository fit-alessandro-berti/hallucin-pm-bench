The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying the core impossibility due to redacted timestamps in Artefact A, preventing calculations of average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% CI for "Approve Invoice." It precisely explains the data absence without guessing or using external knowledge, adhering to the prompt's requirements for a short paragraph in plain text. Minor deductions for slight elaboration on Artefact B (SLA details, which ground truth omits) and phrasing ("handover time" vs. ground truth's focus solely on log data), introducing negligible but present differences in conciseness and scope.
