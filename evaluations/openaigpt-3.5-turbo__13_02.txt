**9.2**

The LLM answer is excellent on Q1-Q2: exact matches for count (1), percentages (2.08%, 8.33% with correct calculations and explanations in parentheses), and formatting.

For Q3 (≤100 words, ~85 used): Covers core requirements—(i) low-support/single-occurrence via "infrequent occurrence" and "rarity" (tied to this activity); (ii) variance/instability via "insufficient data," "skew statistical results," "limited/unrepresentative"; (iii) caution via "mislead analyses," "misleading insights/decisions," "consider context before broad conclusions." No invention, stays on-topic.

Minor deductions (-0.8): Slightly generic ("low-support activities like") vs. ground truth's explicit "appears only once"/"single observation"; lacks specific examples (e.g., cycle time, confidence intervals, noise vulnerability) for utmost precision, per strict criteria.
