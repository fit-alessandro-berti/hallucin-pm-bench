### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst-performing jointly on SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s), matching GT precisely. Quantifies exceedances identically. Uses bullets exclusively for recommendations. Memo structure (To/Subject/intro/recs) is very similar (~150 words, only memo text). Fully grounded in table data (includes cases, derives processing times accurately without invention).
- **Differences (point deductions, strict penalty)**: Header incomplete (no "From"; "COO" vs. "Chief Operating Officer"). Subject phrasing differs. Intro prose vs. GT's bolded list format. Adds data-derived processing time breakdown and specific wait targets (accurate but absent in GT). Recommendations completely different content (LLM time/capacity-focused vs. GT's operational heuristics/rules), despite both being concrete/data-driven. No closing projection (GT has invented one, but absence creates difference). Minor formatting (no bolds/italics). These accumulate to ~20% divergence, especially recs (~33% of content).
