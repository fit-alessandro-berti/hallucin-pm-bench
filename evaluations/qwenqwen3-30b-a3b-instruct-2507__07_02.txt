6.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies three of the added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject) and the single removed task (Reject Loan), as well as the gateway-type change from exclusive to inclusive. However, it incurs a major error by incorrectly classifying the existing `Task_ApproveLoan` (same ID, only name changed from "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan") as a new added task due to a misinterpreted "semantic change," directly violating the instruction to ignore cosmetic renamings. This adds an extraneous item under "Added tasks" and includes erroneous reasoning in a note. Additionally, minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary interpretive phrase "replaced by `Task_FinalReject`" under "Removed tasks," which exceeds the strict summarization scope; (2) superfluous explanation of branching behavior under "Gateway-type changes," not present in the ground truth; and (3) slight formatting inconsistencies (e.g., bullet vs. numbered lists, inclusion of IDs in a way that doesn't perfectly match). Under utmost strictness, the core misclassification of a renaming as an addition warrants a significant penalty, reducing the score from near-perfect to 6.5.
