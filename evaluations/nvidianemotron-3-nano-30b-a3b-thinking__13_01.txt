**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match in factual content to the ground truth across all questions: correct count (1), precise percentage (5.56%, matching calculation and formatting), accurate case list (A1002), and two clearly stated sampling reasons directly aligning with ground truth options (small/non-representative sample size; temporal bias). Phrasing variations are stylistic/minor (e.g., concise listing in Q1/Q3, elaborative but data-grounded examples in Q4), with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log, or errors under strict evaluation.
