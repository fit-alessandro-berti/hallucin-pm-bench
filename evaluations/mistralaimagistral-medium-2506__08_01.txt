The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3, provides a valid concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) matching the ground truth's initial steps, and offers a brief justification aligned with the prompt's requirements, accurately describing the inhibitor arc's role and the marking after T2 that enables T5. However, it lacks the ground truth's deeper insight that T5 "must" fire before T3 (if at all) due to permanent disablement post-T3, and does not extend the sequence to illustrate post-T5 behavior (though this omission avoids the ground truth's error in step 5, where T4 cannot fire after T5 due to p3=0). These omissions in explanatory depth and completeness result in minor differences, warranting a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria. No factual errors in the LLM answer itself.
