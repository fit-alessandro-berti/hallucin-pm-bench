6.0

**Analysis:**

- **Terminology (Policy):** The answer correctly replaces all legacy, forbidden terms with "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance", and does not mention any forbidden variants directly or in brackets. This strictly adheres to the required terminology, which is excellent.

- **Format**: The answer uses a table (markdown), which is fine.

- **Coverage of Activities:** All six specified activities are included and appear in order.

- **Roles:** All expected roles are used as columns, no extras.

**Major Deduction Area: RACI Allocations vs. Ground Truth**

Here, deviations from the ground truth are significant and deserve strict point deductions for each substantive error:

- **Receive Application:**
  - LLM: AM (R, A); GT: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I)
    - Errors: C and I for CO, FC, and IT missing. This is a pretty strong miss.

- **KYC Review:**
  - LLM: AM (C), CO (R, A); GT: AM (A), CO (R), FC (C), IT (I)
    - Errors: AM only marked as "C" not "A", FC and IT omitted. Big for a key compliance step.

- **Order Vetting:**
  - LLM: AM (R, A); GT: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I)
    - Errors: CO, FC, IT omitted. All but the main role missing.

- **Payment Clearance:**
  - LLM: FC (R, A), AM (C); GT: AM (A), CO (C), FC (R), IT (I)
    - Errors: FC gets "A" and "R" instead of just "R", AM only "C" (should be "A"), CO and IT omitted.

- **Record Update:**
  - LLM: IT (R, A), AM (C), FC (C); GT: IT (R), AM (C), FC (C), CO (I)
    - Error: IT gets "A" too, CO missing.

- **Notify Customer:**
  - LLM: AM (R, A), FC (I); GT: AM (R/A), CO (I), FC (I), IT (I)
    - Errors: Only FC included as "I"; CO and IT missing.

**Summary of Scoring Justification:**

- Strict rubric: Every missing/misaligned role-activity allocation is a serious error (not minor).
- The required activities and terminology are present (so not lower than mid-scale). 
- However, the recurring omission of responsible/involved roles, most roles per row missing except for only the primary ones (with only *some* consulted/informed), means the practical utility of this RACI is substantially degraded.
- Supplementary rationale sections, though thoughtful, do not compensate if the matrix allocations themselves are wrong.

**Bottom Line:**  
This answer follows terminology exactly but fails to capture the multi-role involvement crucial to a proper RACI. The score reflects both that it is not a "fail" (since structure and vocabulary are correct), but that the output is only moderately useful due to frequent, repeated misallocations and omissions (i.e., missing Cs/I's, misapplied A's, incomplete multi-role mapping).

**Very small errors lower the grade substantially; given quantity and nature of error, 6.0 is strict but fair.**
