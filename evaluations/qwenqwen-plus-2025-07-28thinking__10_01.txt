2.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Terminology Adherence (Positive, +2 points)**: The LLM correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") exclusively, with no forbidden variants appearing. This fully matches the ground truth and policy.
- **Matrix Structure (Partial, +1 point)**: Basic RACI format is present (rows as activities, columns as roles), with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. However, formatting inconsistencies (e.g., comma-separated entries like "R, A" vs. ground truth's "R / A"; inconsistent bolding; abbreviated headers) create minor deviations, and empty cells fail to represent all required assignments (e.g., missing "C" and "I" entries).
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, -5 points)**: Significant mismatches across nearly all rows, violating the ground truth's narrative reflections:
  - **Receive Application**: Missing "C" (CO) and "I" (FC, IT); AM correctly R/A.
  - **KYC Review**: AM incorrectly "C" (should be "A"); CO incorrectly adds "A" to "R"; missing "C" (FC) and "I" (IT).
  - **Order Vetting**: Missing "C" (CO) and "I" (FC, IT); AM correctly R/A.
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM incorrectly "C" (should be "A"); missing "C" (CO) and "I" (IT); FC incorrectly adds "A" to "R".
  - **Record Update**: Missing "I" (CO); IT incorrectly adds "A" to "R" (ground truth has only "R" for IT, with "C" for AM/FC).
  - **Notify Customer**: Missing "I" (CO, IT); AM correctly R/A; FC "I" correct but isolated.
  - Overall: Fails "exactly one Responsible" in spirit (achieved, but extras/missings disrupt); Accountable roles for AM are often misplaced or absent where required. Each activity lacks full consultation/information flow per ground truth.
- **Unwarranted Content (Penalty, -1.5 points)**: Introduces excessive extras beyond the prompt's request for a matrix: "Key" legend (redundant), "Compliance Note" (self-referential, mentions forbidden terms indirectly despite policy), and "Rationale" section with inaccurate explanations (e.g., claims AM "Consulted" for KYC, contradicting ground truth). This adds bloat and risks policy violation by referencing forbidden terms.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., missing "I" entries, formatting) incur significant deductions; cumulative mismatches justify a low score, tempered slightly by correct terminology and core structure. Total reflects ~75% deviation in content accuracy.
