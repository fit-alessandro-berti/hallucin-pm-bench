3.0

1. The LLM answer misjudges R2: It claims Ship_Goods was within 2 days after the last required approval (Finance_Approval), but per the rule and event trace, after a Change_Request, a new Manager_Approval becomes the final approval, and Ship_Goods in fact occurred before this (and thus outside the correct window), which is a violation.

2. The answer also misjudges R5: It claims compliance, but Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice both occurred after the Change_Request and before the required new Manager_Approval; this is a clear violation.

3. In R3, the LLM correctly identifies the violation.

4. R4 (“Not Applicable”) and R6 (“Compliant”) are correct, as is R1 (“Compliant”), with appropriate reasoning.

5. The overall result “NON-COMPLIANT” is correct, but the justification for only one violation is misleading compared to the actual multiple violations.

Significant loss of points for missing two major violations (R2 and R5) that the ground truth identifies, and for justification errors in those rules. There is also insufficient attention paid to the sequencing logic required by the rules.

Thus: 3.0.
