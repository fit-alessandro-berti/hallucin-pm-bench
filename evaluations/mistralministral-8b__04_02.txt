The LLM answer correctly identifies compliance for R1, R4, and R6, and violation for R3, with acceptable justifications (under 20 words). However, it incorrectly deems R2 compliant (ignores post-change approval timing, violating the 2-day post-last-approval requirement) and R5 compliant (ignores Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice as further processing steps before new Manager_Approval). Overall result is correct but omits key violations, reducing completeness. Significant errors in two rules warrant major deduction under strict criteria.
