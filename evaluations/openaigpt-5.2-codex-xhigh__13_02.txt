**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 (a/b) match the deterministic ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and formatting (e.g., rounding to two decimals, percentages). For 3, the explanation (78 words) precisely meets all criteria: (i) explicitly notes single occurrence ("only one case", "single observation"); (ii) addresses variance/instability ("unstable", "prone to outlier effects"); (iii) cautions over-generalisation ("overfit this rare path or wrongly assume it is typical", "biased conclusions ... when generalised beyond this slice"). No inventions, adheres to data/logic, and aligns with sample's intent without omissions or extras.
