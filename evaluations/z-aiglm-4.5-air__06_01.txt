The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B, orders them alphabetically both within pairs (e.g., swapping "Create_Documentation" before "Quality_Check") and in the overall list (starting with "C" before "P"), and formats the final output nearly identically to the ground truth, including the use of em dashes and line breaks. The minor deductions (0.5 points) stem from extraneous verbose explanations, initial unordered pair mentions, and slight spacing inconsistencies in the second pair's formatting (fewer leading spaces before the em dash compared to the ground truth's alignment), which deviate from the concise structure while not affecting correctness. No factual errors in parallel task identification or process adherence.
