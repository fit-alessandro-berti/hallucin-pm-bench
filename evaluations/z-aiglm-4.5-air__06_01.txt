9.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. The pairs are correctly identified, both within and across pairs are listed in proper alphabetical order, and the format is accurate. The output matches the ground truth except for one small formatting difference: the ground truth aligns the pairs vertically for improved readability using additional spaces, while the LLM answer does not. Additionally, the LLM includes explanatory text before showing the output, whereas the ground truth answer is strictly the formatted list and rationale. 

While the inclusion of minor commentary and the lack of extra alignment do not introduce factual error, per the strict guidance, these constitute small deviations in format and adherence to minimal output instructions. Thus, a slight penalty is warranted, resulting in a score of 9.5.
