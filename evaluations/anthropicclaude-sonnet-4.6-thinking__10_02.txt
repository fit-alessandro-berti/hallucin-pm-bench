**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Key errors and differences (each contributing to point loss):

- **Roles (major error, -3.0 points):** LLM uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support. Ground truth includes **Operations Manager** as a core column (Accountable across all tasks). Missing column invalidates direct comparability and ignores ground truth structure.
  
- **Tasks/Numbering (-2.5 points):** 
  - LLM has 7 tasks (splits source step 5 into "Payment Release" + "SWIFT Message Transmission"; adds #7 "Case File Archiving").
  - Ground truth has exactly 6 tasks, no SWIFT split, different phrasing (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. LLM's "Transfer Instruction Receipt & System Logging"; "Archive Record" vs. "Case File Archiving").
  - Extra task and mismatches fail "maps every step ... without omissions or substitutions."

- **RACI Assignments (major error, -2.0 points):** Near-total mismatch even on overlapping tasks:
  | Approx Mapping | Key Diffs |
  |----------------|-----------|
  | GT1 vs LLM1   | TA R vs R/A; missing OM A, IT C |
  | GT2 vs LLM2   | Matches TA R/RL A superficially, but missing OM I/IT C |
  | GT3 vs LLM3   | RL R vs R/A; missing OM A/IT I |
  | GT4 vs LLM4   | TA C vs I; RL R vs R/A; missing OM A/IT I |
  | GT5 vs LLM5   | TA R vs R/A; missing OM A |
  | GT6 vs LLM7   | TA C present (LLM blank); IT R vs R/A; missing OM A; LLM extra SWIFT unaccounted |
  - LLM frequently combines R/A (non-standard vs. GT's separation); ignores GT's consistent OM A pattern.

- **Structure/Format (-0.3 points):** 
  - Extra unrequested elements: Title, "Role legend", full "RACI Key" table, extensive "Notes & Decision Rules" (GT has minimal legend + 2-sentence note).
  - Different headers (# column, bolding, centering); GT's "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" absent.
  - Markdown table present but not "clearly organised" identically.

- **Vocabulary/Compliance (+ minor credit):** Perfect match on mandated terms (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst)—no deductions here, but insufficient to offset.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts ~7.8 for above → **2.0** (minimal credit for Markdown table, vocab adherence, and general process coverage; no higher due to strictness on differences). LLM reinterprets/invents rather than matching ground truth exactly.
