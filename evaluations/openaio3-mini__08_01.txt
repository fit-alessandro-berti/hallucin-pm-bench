8.0

**Evaluation:**

The LLM answer is correct in its main claim: it recognizes that T5 can fire before T3, and it provides a correct concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5). It also justifies that after T1 and T2, T5 is enabled since p3 = 1 and p4 = 0.

**Positive points:**
- The marking evolution is accurately described step by step.
- The correct enabling condition for T5 (p3 token present, p4 token absent) is recognized and applied.
- The answer clearly demonstrates that "T3 has not yet fired when T5 fires."
- It provides a minimal sequence showing the desired property.

**Errors and Omissions causing loss of points:**
- The LLM answer stops after firing T5, without discussing the *uniqueness* or necessity of this firing order for T5, nor the fact that firing T3 permanently disables T5, which is crucial for a *full* proof/justification (as in the ground truth).
- It does not provide a post-T5 firing of T3 or discuss the net behaviour after T5, so the relation between the inhibitor arc and the impossibility of T5 after T3 is not explained.
- It is less explicit about the logical consequence: "[...] T5 can, and indeed must, fire before T3 if it is ever to occur," which is a deeper insight given in the ground truth.
- There is a slight omission in not showing what happens if T3 fires first (should state T5 would then be permanently disabled).
- The answer could be slightly clearer in relating this particular behaviour to the structure of the net (i.e., T4 never decreases p4 without also clearing p3), matching the detail in the ground truth.

**Conclusion:** The LLM answer is fully correct for the sequence and the main logic, but it does not capture the completeness and depth of the explanation in the ground truth, particularly regarding the disabling of T5 once T3 has fired. This warrants a significant deduction, resulting in a strict score of 8.0.
