**1.0**

The LLM answer fails strictly against the ground truth: it modifies the wrong task (`Task_GrantAccess` instead of `Task_CollectEquipment`), applies an incorrect dueDate change (`P1D` to `PT2H` vs. `P5D` to `P2D`), provides a malformed/invalid unified diff (wrong hunk header `@@ -1,0 +1,0 @@`, extraneous comment, no proper context, presented as empty file change), exceeds the one-sentence rationale limit with multi-paragraph explanation and extra sections/headings ("### **1. Unified Diff**", "**Key Insight**"), and adds preamble text violating the exact output format of "1. Unified diff ... 2. One-sentence rationale". Every aspect mismatches, warranting the minimum score.
