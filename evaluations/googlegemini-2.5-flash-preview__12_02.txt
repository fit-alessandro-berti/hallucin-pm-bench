The LLM correctly answers "No" and cites the counterexample in C003 where Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order. It also mentions the other cases but summarizes C004 and C005 inaccurately: it claims "Validate_Payment not being followed by Receive_Order" in cases C004 and C005, but the requirement is Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order (i.e., Receive_Order comes first). However, the LLM fails to explicitly note that in C005, Validate_Payment appears without Receive_Order present at all—this is a crucial concrete counterexample present in the gold-standard answer but missing from the LLM's justification. The gold-standard answer also directly lists relevant line numbers and gives clearer, more precise reasoning tied to each case. These omissions and imprecision, especially regarding C005’s absence of Receive_Order, result in a significant deduction of points.
