5.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Errors - 40% weight, scored ~2/10)**: 
  - LLM identifies only 2 decision points vs. ground truth's 3; **completely misses #3: Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as an explicit decision (board votes Approve/Reject).
  - Lacks precise contextual placement (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
  - Minor phrasing diffs: "> 2 points" vs. "differ by ≤ 2"; "escalated to" vs. "send to"; no italicized conditional arrows (⇒).
  - Uses bolding and parentheses inconsistently vs. ground truth.

- **Required Documents (Minor Errors - 30% weight, scored ~8/10)**: 
  - Lists all 6 correctly and comprehensively.
  - Phrasing variances: Adds "old" (accurate to prompt but not exact GT "≤ 3 months"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. GT "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. GT "(CIS)"; bolding/formatting diffs.
  - Misses ground truth's closing note ("*(No credit bureau...)*").

- **Overall Structure/Formatting (20% weight, scored ~4/10)**: Headers (### vs. ####), separators (--- vs. none), bolding/italics absent where GT uses them, extra "**" emphasis.

- **Fidelity to Prompt (10% weight, scored ~9/10)**: Uses exact activity names, no standard terminology introduced.

**Total: Significant omissions (missing decision point, contexts) warrant major deduction; minor phrasing/formatting losses compound under strict criteria.**
