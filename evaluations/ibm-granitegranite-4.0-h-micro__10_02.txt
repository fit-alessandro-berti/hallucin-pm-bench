3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
With utmost strictness, the LLM answer receives a low score due to multiple significant deviations from the ground truth, including structural differences, content inaccuracies, vocabulary violations, and omissions. Below is a breakdown of key differences, emphasizing that even minor errors (e.g., phrasing) contribute to point loss:

#### 1. **Structural Differences (Major Impact: -3.0 points)**
   - Ground truth uses a standard RACI matrix format: tasks/activities as rows, roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) as columns, with R/A/C/I letters in cells, plus a legend.
   - LLM uses an alternative format: step numbers and descriptive tasks as rows, R/A/C/I as separate columns (with roles distributed across them). While both are valid RACI presentations, this deviates from the ground truth's clear, role-centric matrix, reducing clarity and alignment. No legend is provided in LLM, unlike ground truth.

#### 2. **Omissions and Additions in Roles and Coverage (Major Impact: -2.0 points)**
   - Ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a core role (Accountable for all tasks), which is absent entirely in LLM. This is a critical omission, as it alters the entire accountability structure (e.g., LLM incorrectly assigns Accountable to Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison in steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
   - LLM misuses "KYC Review" as a role (e.g., Consulted in step 1), violating the prompt's mandate that it is an *activity* only, not a role. This introduces invalid entries not present in ground truth.
   - Step 5 in LLM combines "Release payment and send SWIFT message" into one task with split responsibilities (Consulted/Informed: IT Support, Regulatory Liaison), but ground truth separates "Release Payment" and omits explicit SWIFT handling (treating it implicitly under Release). Step 6 in LLM adds "and notify compliance officer" as part of the task, which ground truth handles via Informed (Regulatory Liaison) without altering the task description.
   - All steps in ground truth are covered without omissions, but LLM's assignments (e.g., Informed often defaults to Transaction Analyst, ignoring IT Support or Operations Manager) fail to match.

#### 3. **Vocabulary Violations (Major Impact: -1.5 points)**
   - Prompt mandates strict use of “Transaction Analyst” (for clerk), “Regulatory Liaison” (never “Compliance Officer”), and “KYC Review” (for CDD, as an activity).
   - LLM correctly uses these in most task descriptions (e.g., step 3: "Perform KYC Review") and roles, but violates in step 6 task: "notify compliance officer" (should be "Regulatory Liaison"). This is a direct, small-but-significant breach.
   - Misuse of "KYC Review" as a role (Consulted in step 1) further compounds the issue.

#### 4. **Content Inaccuracies in RACI Assignments (Major Impact: -2.0 points)**
   - Step 1 (Receive): LLM (R: TA, A: TA, C: KYC Review/RL, I: TA) vs. GT (R: TA, A: OM, C: IT, I: RL). Wrong A, invalid C, wrong I.
   - Step 2 (Screen): LLM (R: TA, A: TA, C: RL, I: TA) vs. GT (R: TA, A: RL, C: IT, I: OM). Wrong A and I.
   - Step 3 (KYC Review): LLM (R: RL, A: RL, C: TA, I: TA) vs. GT (R: RL, A: OM, C: TA, I: IT). Wrong A and I.
   - Step 4 (Approve): LLM (R: RL, A: RL, C: TA, I: TA) vs. GT (R: RL, A: OM, C: TA, I: IT). Wrong A and I.
   - Step 5 (Release): LLM (R: TA, A: TA, C: IT/RL, I: IT/RL) vs. GT (R: TA, A: OM, C: IT, I: RL). Wrong A; C/I partially match but bloated.
   - Step 6 (Archive): LLM (R: IT, A: RL, C: TA/IT, I: RL) vs. GT (R: IT, A: OM, C: TA, I: RL). Wrong A; extra self-C for IT.
   - Phrasing differences: E.g., LLM's "customer’s transfer instruction" vs. GT's "Payment Instruction"; "high-risk transactions (if flagged)" vs. GT's "Approve High-Risk Transactions". These are small but deduct points per strictness rule.
   - Extra explanatory text in LLM ("This RACI table outlines...") is unnecessary and not in ground truth.

#### 5. **Positive Aspects (Partial Credit: +2.0 points)**
   - Covers all 6 steps from the informal description without major omissions.
   - Uses Markdown table as required.
   - Adopts mandated terms correctly in most core places (e.g., "Transaction Analyst" for receiving/screening/releasing, "Regulatory Liaison" for KYC/approval, "KYC Review" as activity in step 3).
   - Maps source text reasonably (e.g., IT Support for archiving/SWIFT).

Overall, while the LLM attempts a complete table and follows some mandates, the cumulative errors—especially missing Operations Manager, incorrect accountabilities, vocabulary slips, and structural mismatch—result in substantial divergence. A perfect match would score 10.0; this is closer to a partial effort with foundational flaws.
