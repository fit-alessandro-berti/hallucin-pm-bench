The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the proper order, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements without extraneous information about other processes. It matches the ground truth's core content precisely. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., plain numbering and commas instead of descriptive headers, backticks, and the â€– symbol; absence of the closing sentence), which under strict evaluation warrant a small point loss despite no factual errors.
