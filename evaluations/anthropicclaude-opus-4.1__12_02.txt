The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground-truth answer in both substance and use of evidence. It correctly answers "No," references the same cases (C003 and C005), and precisely describes the violations: *Validate_Payment* precedes *Receive_Order* in C003 and occurs without *Receive_Order* in C005. The LLM cites the correct line numbers, giving a slightly greater amount of detail (explicit timestamps from line 6/7). The only very minor deviation is that the gold-standard answer separates its bullet points more explicitly and uses slightly more formal formatting. The LLM's description is just barely more verbose and less formatted than the gold, but all factual content perfectly matches.

Deducting a small amount (0.5) for the very minor differences in style/organization (e.g., more formal structure, clearer bullet points in the gold), but the logic, evidence, and correctness are flawless.
