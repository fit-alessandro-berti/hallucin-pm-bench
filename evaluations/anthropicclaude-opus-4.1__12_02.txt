The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and accurately cites the key counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), matching the ground truth's core reasoning that these prove the claim false. However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for unnecessary additions: including positive examples (C001 and C002) not present in the ground truth, referencing specific timestamps (unneeded for verification), and mentioning the Cancel_Order in C005 (irrelevant to the claim). These deviations introduce extraneous details and alter the concise, bullet-point structure of the ground truth into a denser paragraph, slightly reducing fidelity despite no factual errors.
