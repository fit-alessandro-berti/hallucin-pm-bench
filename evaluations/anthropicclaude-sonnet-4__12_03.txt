The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a thorough, accurate justification by citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001, C002, C003, C004) and their activity sequences, highlighting counterexamples (C002, C004) with precise intervening activities (Pack_Items and Check_Fraud). It also notes compliant cases (C001, C003) and logically concludes based on the "always" claim being violated in 2/4 cases, aligning closely with the ground truth's content and reasoning. Minor deduction for stylistic differences: the response uses a textual list format rather than the ground truth's tabular case-by-case structure with explicit "Notes" column, which provides a slightly more organized visual breakdown without adding new information. No factual errors or omissions.
