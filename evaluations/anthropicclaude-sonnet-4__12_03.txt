The LLM answer is very accurate and fully correct: it identifies the answer as "No," and provides the correct justification by explicitly listing Case C002 and C004 as counterexamples, including the correct activity sequences for each relevant case. It also notes which cases do follow the pattern and summarizes why the original fact is incorrect.

**Differences/Minor Errors:**  
- The LLM answer does not present the information in a tabular format for a clear case-by-case distinction as the ground truth does, but it still covers all the necessary content clearly and explicitly.
- The LLM’s justification slightly abbreviates, e.g., combining “Counter-examples” and “Cases that do follow the pattern” in prose instead of a systematic table.
- The original prompt requests a "case-by-case" justification, which the ground truth answers with a precise table, while the LLM does it in list format. The difference is minor but does miss the tabular clarity.

**Impact:**  
While these are minor differences mostly about presentation and explicitness (not errors of content or reasoning), they should result in a slight deduction, reflecting the utmost strictness requested.

**Final Score:** 9.0
