4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **R1**: Status and justification match (Compliant). Minor phrasing difference, no deduction beyond format.
- **R2**: **Major violation** - Wrong status (Compliant vs. Violated). Justification fundamentally incorrect (ignores post-Change_Request approval as "last required," misapplies 2-day window). Critical error deducts heavily.
- **R3**: Status and justification match (Violated).
- **R4**: Status and justification match (Not Applicable).
- **R5**: Status matches (Violated), but justification **exceeds 20-word limit** (27 words) and adds unneeded detail (Receive_Goods). Strict penalty for word count breach.
- **R6**: Status and justification match (Compliant).
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by R2 error.
- **Format**: Adds unnecessary headings/report structure (prompt specifies simple per-rule statements + overall). Minor deductions.
- **Strictness applied**: One critical status error (R2) + word limit exceed = ~60% point loss from perfect 10.0. 5/6 rules accurate but weighted heavily against.
