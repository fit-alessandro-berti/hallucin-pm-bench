**Score: 8.5**

**Evaluation:**

The LLM answer is largely correct and demonstrates a good understanding of the Petri net dynamics, but there are a few minor but important issues resulting in loss of points:

**Strengths:**
- For Q1, the answer correctly says "Yes" and succinctly justifies the reasoning with correct references to the relevant transitions and places.
- For Q2, the LLM supplies a correct and minimal firing sequence: T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5, which matches the ground truth.

**Minor Issues:**
- The LLM's explanation for Q1 is less precise than the ground truth. It suggests "T3 only needs P2" (true), but does not explicitly mention that after T5 fires and consumes P2, T3 is then disabled and cannot fire after T5, which provides a more complete justification that T5 can fire before T3 and also prevents T3 from ever firing after T5.
- The LLM answer omits the stepwise marking evolution/M₁...M₅ notation presented in the ground truth, though this is a minor omission since the actual sequence is present and correct.
- There is some ambiguity in "while P2 still holds its initial token" – it's clear in context but not as precisely worded as in the ground truth reasoning.

**Conclusion:**
The answer is accurate, correct in firing sequence, and essentially matches the ground truth but lacks a little precision and completeness in the explanation and marking details. These small deficiencies together warrant a deduction of 1.5 points for strict grading.

**Final Score:** 8.5/10
