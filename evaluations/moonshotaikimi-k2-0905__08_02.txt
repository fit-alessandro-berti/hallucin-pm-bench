The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering "yes" for Q1 with a solid explanation of the alternative path via T7 to enable P5 without firing T3, while preserving the P2 token. For Q2, it provides the exact minimal sequence requested (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) as an ordered list. Minor deductions for lacking the detailed markings and the confirmatory note on T3's disablement (present in ground truth), which add precision but are not strictly required; however, these omissions slightly reduce completeness under strict evaluation.
