6.5

**Evaluation:**

### a) Decision Points

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies the two essential decision points: the risk-based skip (conditional branch) and the TriVote gate.
- The logic of both is concisely and mostly accurately described.

**Errors & Deductions:**
- The first listed "decision point" in the LLM answer, "Tri-Color-Risk-Check," is not a decision point but a process step (it produces an output, but is not itself a gate or branching rule as per the user question and ground truth). Including this step as a "decision point" is a clear error and evidence of misunderstandingâ€”and constitutes a significant deduction.
- The "Risk-Based Skip of Manual Underwriting" point is described correctly, but not as clearly or precisely as the ground truth (which specifies both the risk rating and amount must hold to skip).
- The TriVote gate is described properly, though the LLM answer omits the fact that all three participant roles are mandatory throughout, not just at this vote, though that's less directly related to the answer for part (a).
- The enumeration/formatting, with three points instead of two, deviates from ground truth: over-inclusion of non-gates or decision branches.

### b) Document List

**Strengths:**
- Includes every required document from the process and presents them in order of first appearance for the most part.
- No hallucinated or extraneous documents are present.

**Errors & Deductions:**
- Fails to separately list "Signed Offer Sheet 77," mentioning "Offer Sheet 77 (produced in Prepare-Binding-Offer; also signed in Request-Applicant-Confirmation)" instead, which is ambiguous and does not clearly identify the signed version as a distinct required document. The ground truth requires explicit, separate listing of both the unsigned and signed Offer Sheet 77 (the act of signing produces a document with distinct legal relevance).
- The rest of the list matches but this omission is notable and shows a lack of rigor.

---

### SUMMARY

- The LLM answer contains a significant conceptual error in part (a) and fails to enumerate documents as precisely as the ground truth requires in part (b).
- These are both non-trivial, especially as per the instruction that even small errors must penalize the score significantly.

**Final score: 6.5**
