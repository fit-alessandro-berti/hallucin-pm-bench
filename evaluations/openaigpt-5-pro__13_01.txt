9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Exact match (5.56%, with correct calculation implied). Minor formatting difference (no space before % vs. ground truth's "5.56 %"), but content is identical. Negligible deduction.
- **Question 3**: Core information correct (identifies A1002), but lacks the explicit "only" qualifier and full phrasing from ground truth (e.g., no bolding or emphasis on exclusivity). This is a small omission in completeness, warranting a minor deduction.
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, relevant reasons that align well with ground truth options (small sample size/high variance from 18 events/4 cases; temporal bias from short, contiguous time window on one day). Explanations are detailed and sampling-focused without hallucination or inference beyond the log. Strong match, but phrasing is not verbatim (e.g., "high sampling error" vs. "high variance"; "partial day 09:00â€“14:05" vs. "morning of 1 May 2025"), leading to a small deduction for precision.

Overall, the response is highly accurate, directly derived from the log, and avoids assumptions, but minor phrasing/completeness issues prevent a perfect score under strict criteria.
