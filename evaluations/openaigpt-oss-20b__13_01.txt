9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match in content (1 occurrence/time); minor wording difference ("time" vs. "occurrence") is negligible but noted under strictness. Full credit.
- **Question 2**: Calculation and result identical (5.56%); added phrase "of all logged events" is redundant but accurate and does not contradict. Minor deduction for unnecessary elaboration.
- **Question 3**: Identifies the correct case (A1002) but omits key phrasing from ground truth ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”"), making it less precise and complete. Significant deduction for incompleteness under strict criteria.
- **Question 4**: Both reasons are valid and align closely with ground truth options (small sample size matches directly; "limited time window/selection bias" is a reasonable paraphrase of "temporal bias"). Explanations are clear, non-hallucinatory, and derived from the log. Full credit.

Overall, the response is highly accurate, adheres to the system's constraints (no inferences beyond the 18 lines), and provides a structured answer. The score reflects strong fidelity with deductions only for small phrasing/verbosity gaps.
