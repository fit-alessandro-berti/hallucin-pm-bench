9.0

**Justification:**

- **Q1 (Count):** Perfect. The answer is correctly "1 time" as per the log.
- **Q2 (Percentage):** Perfect. "5.56 %" matches the ground truth, both in numeric value and to two decimal places.
- **Q3 (Cases):** Correct. "A1002" is the only correct case. The ground truth is slightly more verbose ("Only case A1002..."), but the LLM's answer is precise and correct.
- **Q4 (Sampling biases):**
  - **Small sample size:** Answer is clear and accurate.
  - **Limited time window/selection bias:** The LLM says "covers a single day (2025‑05‑01)... does not capture other days or seasonal patterns." This matches the ground truth's "temporal bias," albeit with slightly different wording.
  - The LLM does not mention "case-mix bias" or "survivorship/truncation bias," but only two are required.

**Small deduction (-1.0):**  
- Q2: The LLM uses the U+202F narrow no-break space as the thousands separator (as in "5.56 %"). While this is not technically incorrect and retains readability, it departs from the ground truth's plain format ("5.56 %").
- Q3: The response omits "Only case" and simply lists "A1002". This is technically correct, but is slightly less clear per the ground truth's phrasing.
- Responses could be even more explicit in matching the prompt and the clarity of the ground-truth explanations, especially for Q3 and the rationale in Q4.

**Conclusion:**  
Very accurate, with only minimal departures in format/wording. No error in substance. Hence, a strict 9.0.
