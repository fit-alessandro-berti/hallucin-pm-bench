6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Strict Issues:**

1. **Missing Role** – The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" role present in the ground truth. According to the ground truth, this role is **accountable** for every activity, which is a fundamental process RACI principle for segregation of duties and governance. This is a major error.

2. **Task Names** – The LLM introduces or modifies task names:
   - "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" (ok) but elsewhere just says "Release approved payment," which deviates from the ground truth's "Release Payment."
   - "Ensure SWIFT message transmission" is extra detail (acceptable), but "Archive case file" doesn't use the mandated vocabulary exactly ("Archive Record" in ground truth).

3. **Roles Used** – The roles in the table **do** use the system-mandated terms, but "Operations Manager" is omitted despite being in the ground truth and being critical for proper oversight.

4. **RACI Assignments** – The allocations of R, A, C, I do not always match the ground truth:
   - For several tasks, "Accountable" is not assigned at all for some steps.
   - For "Receive customer transfer instruction," "Accountable" should not be IT Support, but is not indicated at all.
   - "Receive case closure notification" is not a process step from the source nor in the ground truth—this is invention by the LLM.

5. **Superfluous/Invented Steps** — "Receive case closure notification" does not exist in the source description or ground truth; this adds confusion.

6. **Clarity** — The RACI assignments are generally inferior to the ground truth, since only the mandated roles should be present for mapping all process accountability.

**Summary:**
- Proper vocabulary is used for personas, but a key necessary role ("Operations Manager") is omitted—this severely damages both governance and process compliance.
- Process step naming is not always as succinct or strictly matching the mandated phrases as in the ground truth.
- The RACI assignments are incomplete (missing A’s for most steps).
- Extra steps appear.

**Scale Interpretation:**
- 10 = Perfect match
- 9–8 = Minor (one or two) small errors, but nothing fundamental
- 7 = Notable, but not process-breaking errors (minor omissions or mislabels)
- 6 = Significant but fixable shortfalls; structure present but lacks authority or essential elements
- 5 or below = Major errors (role omissions, significant vocabulary and assignment mistakes)

**Conclusion:**  
**6.0 – The submission reflects partial compliance with process structure and mandated roles/terms, but omits a crucial role, misassigns authority, and includes an invented step, making it flawed compared to the grounded standard.**
