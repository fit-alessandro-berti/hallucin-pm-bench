4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt's requirements but deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, roles, task coverage, and RACI assignments, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Roles**: The LLM uses only "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", and "IT Support" (3 columns), omitting "Operations Manager" which is central to the ground truth's accountability assignments (4 columns). This leads to incomplete RACI distribution, as many tasks in the LLM lack an explicit "A" (Accountable) role, violating standard RACI principles and mismatching the ground truth's consistent "A" for Operations Manager.

- **Tasks**: 
  - The LLM expands to 8 tasks, splitting "Release approved payment" into separate "Release" and "Ensure SWIFT message transmission", and adds an extraneous "Receive case closure notification" task (with incorrect assignments like R to Regulatory Liaison and A to IT Support, which doesn't align with the source text's simple notification). The ground truth consolidates into 6 precise tasks (e.g., combining release and SWIFT under "Release Payment", with archiving as "Archive Record").
  - Wording differences: LLM uses verbose phrases like "Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction". "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record". "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**" (ground truth emphasizes mandated term). These are not minor; they alter clarity and fidelity to the source.
  - No omissions in coverage, but additions inflate and distort the matrix.

- **RACI Assignments**: Major mismatches per task, even where tasks overlap:
  - Receive: LLM (R Analyst, I Liaison/IT) vs. Ground (R Analyst, A Ops, I Liaison, C IT) – misses A and C.
  - Screen: LLM (R Analyst, I Liaison/IT) vs. Ground (R Analyst, A Liaison, I Ops, C IT) – wrong A and misses C.
  - KYC Review: LLM (C Analyst, R Liaison, I IT) vs. Ground (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Ops, I IT) – misses A.
  - Approve: LLM (I Analyst, R Liaison, I IT) vs. Ground (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Ops, I IT) – wrong C/I for Analyst.
  - Release: LLM (R Analyst, I Liaison, C IT) vs. Ground (R Analyst, I Liaison, A Ops, C IT) – misses A.
  - SWIFT (LLM extra): Not in ground truth; assignments (C Analyst, I Liaison, R IT) redundant with Release.
  - Archive: LLM (I Analyst, I Liaison, R IT) vs. Ground (C Analyst, I Liaison, A Ops, R IT) – wrong C/I for Analyst, misses A.
  - Notification (LLM extra): Entirely fabricated; ground truth implies it within Archive (I for Liaison).

- **Vocabulary and Formatting**: 
  - Correct use of mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") – a strength, earning partial credit.
  - However, Markdown table is present but poorly organized (no "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header; unbalanced columns). Extra sections like "# Header", "Legend", and "Roles Definition" are not in ground truth and add unsolicited content, diluting focus.
  - Ground truth's notes on mandated wording adherence are absent in LLM.

- **Overall Fidelity**: The LLM captures the informal description's essence and mandated vocabulary but introduces inventions (extra tasks/role assignments) and omissions (no Operations Manager, inconsistent A), resulting in a matrix that doesn't "cover every task" as precisely or correctly as the ground truth. Under utmost strictness, these cumulative errors (structural, content, and assignment discrepancies) deduct heavily from a perfect score. A 4.0 reflects basic vocabulary compliance and task coverage but penalizes all mismatches.
