9.0

The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth, correctly grouping and listing all changes:

- **Added tasks:** All three new tasks (“Verify Identity”, “Request Additional Documents”, “Final Reject”) are present and correctly named with IDs.
- **Removed tasks:** “Reject Loan” is correctly noted as removed, with the correct ID.
- **Gateway-type changes:** The gateway change from exclusive to inclusive is described, referencing both the name and type.

**Small errors resulting in a 1-point deduction:**
- The LLM used quotes around task names but, for “Approve Loan”, it did not note the name was changed to “Auto-Approve Loan” in v2, but this is correctly ignored per the prompt (cosmetic renamings not to be mentioned).
- While both answers reference the correct gateway by name (“Gateway ‘Eligible?’”), the LLM optionally adds “Eligibility Check” (the v2 label) in parentheses and refers to it as “Gateway ‘Eligible?’”. The ground truth uses the ID `Gateway_Decision`, which is preferable for strictness.
- There is a very minor stylistic divergence (e.g., inclusion of names and IDs in the ground truth answer, but the LLM answer uses only name and sometimes ID, not both consistently). The LLM could be clearer in consistently including both.

**Substance:** No substantial information is missed or wrongly added.

**Conclusion:** This is a near-perfect answer with only minor precision/stylistic deviations; thus, it earns a strict 9.0.
