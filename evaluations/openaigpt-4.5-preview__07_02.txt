### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes in content (added tasks: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject; removed task: Reject Loan; gateway type: exclusive to inclusive). However, under "Gateway-type changes," it unnecessarily includes cosmetic name details ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check"), violating the instruction to "ignore cosmetic renamings." This introduces extraneous information not present in the ground truth, which strictly focuses on the type change using the ID and precise terminology (XOR/OR). Formatting differences (bullets vs. numbered lists, quotes vs. bold/backticks) are minor but contribute to deviation from the ground truth's structure. No factual errors, but strict adherence to ignoring cosmetics and matching phrasing precision warrants a deduction from a perfect score.
