**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high alignment, minimal deduction)**:
  - **Required documents**: Perfect match (identical list of 7 documents, same order, phrasing, and conditional note implied via step reference for AuditTrail). Full points here.
  - Identifies exactly 3 decision points, matching GT count.
  - No introduction of undefined activities/artefacts; adheres to prompt constraints.
  - Covers core elements: triage eligibility, pre-approval, high-value branch (> €1 000).

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences, per strict criteria)**:
  - **Decision points summaries lack precision and completeness** (-1.5): 
    - Misses explicit **branching logic/outcomes** (e.g., GT details "*Eligible* → continue; *Not eligible* → rejected/returned"; "*Approved* → payment; *Rejected* → ends"). LLM only describes *what* is decided, not outcomes/paths.
    - Frames decisions around activity names rather than abstracted "*Eligibility check*", "*Amount threshold*", "*Final payment approval*" (-0.3).
    - High-value branch placement vaguely "implicit" without GT's exact "*after Finance_Controller_PreApprove*" timing (-0.2).
    - No explicit treatment of **Senior_Auditor_Review** as part of "final approval" decision (GT combines it; LLM implies via branch but doesn't summarize as judgment point).
  - **Format/structure differences** (-0.5): List vs. GT's table (less structured summary of logic); extra "Key Notes" section adds redundancy not in GT.
  - Small phrasing variances (e.g., "decides if eligible *based on*" vs. GT's clean "*Eligibility check during*"; "inherent in the branch condition" unnecessary elaboration) reflect minor but penalized divergences.

Overall: ~85% semantic/structural fidelity (excellent docs, solid but shallower decisions). Strict penalty for incomplete outcome details and non-identical summaries drops from 10.0.
