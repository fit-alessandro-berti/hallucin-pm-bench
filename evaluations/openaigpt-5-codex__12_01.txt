The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and evidence-based, correctly identifying the fact as false by analyzing all three cases with proper sequencing and absence details. It aligns closely with the ground truth in structure, verdict, and key justifications, citing case IDs and activities as required. Minor deductions for: (1) slightly less direct phrasing in Case 1002 (misses explicit "never appears, disproving 'always'"); (2) lack of line number citations for precision; (3) no summarizing conclusion sentence; and (4) not explicitly addressing the "immediately" aspect in justifications (though implied correctly via sequencing contradictions). These are small but warrant a strict 0.5-point loss.
