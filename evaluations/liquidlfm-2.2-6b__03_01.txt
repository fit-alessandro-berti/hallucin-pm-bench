1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally invalid BPMN 2.0 XML and fails to accurately model the described process. Key failures include: malformed structure (e.g., non-existent <partName> tags repeated ~15 times; pseudocode-like sequenceFlow syntax such as "t1 >>= se:OnTicketSubmitted" instead of proper <sequenceFlow> elements with sourceRef/targetRef); incomplete/invented elements (e.g., <decisionPoint>, nested <process>, unclosed tags like "< sequenceFlow>"); incorrect flow logic (e.g., loop back to "RetryTicketSubmission" instead of directly to "Initial Diagnosis" as per line 9; no clear path from specialist to "Resolve Issue"; extraneous paths like "HaltOnClose"); missing required elements (e.g., no proper <startEvent id="..."/>, <endEvent>, or two exclusive gateways with conditions; no "Auto-Classification" task; "Provide Reset Instructions" and "Confirm with Customer" not properly connected); exceeds intent with additions (e.g., "CustomerReportsPersistentIssue", "CompleteResolution" events not mentioned); ignores namespace/xmlns declarations; non-concise and non-XML compliant output with appended note. This deviates entirely from the ground truth's clean, exact  <definitions> block (30 lines) with precise tasks (t1-t6), gateways (gw1-gw3), flows (f1-f13), and loop to t3, violating the "do not invent" rule at every level.
