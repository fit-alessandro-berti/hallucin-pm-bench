**8.0**

The LLM answer identifies the exact correct pairs (**Create_Documentation — Quality_Check** and **Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines**) in the correct alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall list), matching the semantic content and rationale of the ground truth perfectly. It uses the specified format with one pair per line and appropriate spacing around the em dash ("  —  ").

However, under utmost strictness with significant point loss for small errors/differences:
- Missing leading blank line present in ground truth (1.0 point deduction).
- Lacks precise monospace alignment padding on the second line ("Procure_Materials     —" requires ~5 spaces after "Materials" to align the em dash with the first line's column position; LLM uses only ~2 spaces) (1.0 point deduction).

No other content, order, or major format errors. Perfect match would be 10.0; these whitespace/formatting diffs prevent it.
