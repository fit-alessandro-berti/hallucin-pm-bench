The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in conclusion ("No"), per-rule assessments (all match: 1/2/4 satisfied, 3 violated), and reasonings (identical violation identified for Rule 3; minor rephrasing but equivalent logic/details like positions add precision without contradiction). Strict deductions: -0.5 for format differences (bullets vs. table with ✔/❌ symbols and headers; no "### Expected answer" prefix). No factual/content errors.
