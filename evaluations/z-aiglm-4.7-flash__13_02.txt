**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth exactly on all deterministic parts (Q1: 1; Q2a: 2.08%; Q2b: 8.33%). For Q3, the explanation (84 words) precisely meets all criteria: (i) explicitly notes single occurrence via "1/48 events"; (ii) highlights variance/instability via "statistical outlier," "rare anomaly," "overfitting," and models treating as "noise"; (iii) cautions against over-generalization via "generalizing from this snippet risks overfitting," "misrepresent the typical process path," and reveals exceptional nature. No inventions, errors, or deviations; adheres to data, format, and ≤100 words.
