The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core conclusion (impossibility of computation/derivation due to absent temporal data) and reasoning (explicit lack of timestamps/durations). Minor deductions for slightly more verbose phrasing and explicit reference to the historical benchmark (which ground truth omits but does not contradict), but no substantive errors or deviations.
