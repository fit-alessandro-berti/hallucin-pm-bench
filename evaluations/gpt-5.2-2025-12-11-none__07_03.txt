The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), removed task (Task_ManualReview), and gateway changes (both gateways from exclusive to parallel). Content is verbatim accurate for ids, names, and change descriptions.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Headings are prefixed with "-" (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS"), violating "verbatim" requirement (major structural deviation, -1.0).
- Bullets are indented with two spaces (e.g., "  - Task_..."), not matching ground truth flush-left bullets (-0.5).
- Second gateway line lacks alignment spaces after colon ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive" vs. "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive"), a whitespace difference (-0.5).

Perfect content but formatting errors warrant deduction.
