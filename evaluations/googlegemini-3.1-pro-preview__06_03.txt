The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the proper order, with no extraneous information about other processes and full semantic accuracy. However, under utmost strictness, deduct points for multiple small but noticeable differences from the ground truth: (1) unnecessary introductory sentence, (2) lack of descriptive labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**", (3) use of "and" instead of the more precise BPMN-like "‖" symbol, (4) "**bold**" formatting instead of "`backticks`", and (5) absence of the closing confirmatory sentence "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." These stylistic and presentational deviations prevent a perfect score.
