The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1 (claims "No" when ground truth is "Yes"), missing the alternative path via T2-T7-T4 to mark P5 while P2 remains unmarked by T3. This leads to an invalid Q2 explanation ignoring the demonstrated sequence. No partial credit; the error invalidates the entire response.
