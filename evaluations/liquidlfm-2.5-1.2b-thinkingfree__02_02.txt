**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict line-by-line vs. ground truth):
- **Q1/A1**: Exact match (**3**). Full points.
- **Q2/A2**: Major errors—uses line numbers (**2 → 5 → 8 → 10**) instead of activity names (**Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**); fabricated/missing names; incorrect explanation (e.g., references line 6 wrongly). Severe mismatch.
- **Q3/A3**: Complete hallucination (**C001, C002, C003** are cases, not activities); misses **Arrange_Delivery** and **Check_Stock**; wrong format (not one per line, alphabetical); fabricated explanation.
- **Overall**: Extra/wrong explanations, poor formatting (boxes vs. table), hallucinations → 80%+ deviation. Strict penalty applied.
