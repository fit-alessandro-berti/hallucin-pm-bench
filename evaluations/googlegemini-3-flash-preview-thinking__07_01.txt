8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
**Factual Accuracy (full credit: 10/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies all changes:
- Added: `check_vip`, `generate_qr` (exact IDs from v2 absent in v1).
- Removed: `send_rma_label` (exact ID from v1 absent in v2).
- Gateway: `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway` (exact types).
No extras or misses; adheres to "only factual differences" and specified categories.

**Format & Structure (partial credit: 7/10)**:
- Headings match prompt's "exact" spec (`• Added tasks` etc.) better than GT's `**Added tasks**`.
- Lists use `-` (consistent but differs from GT's `*`): minor deduction.
- No "(none)" needed (correct).

**Detail & Phrasing (partial credit: 6/10)**:
- Tasks use exact element **IDs** (`check_vip` etc.), factual from XML `id=` attrs, but GT uses **names** + `(id = \`id\`)` format (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"): significant difference in presentation/readability.
- Gateway phrasing factual but lacks GT's `(v1)/(v2)`, backticks `\``gw_valid\``, and **bold**: noticeable gap.
- No GT footer note (not required by prompt).

**Overall**: Perfect facts, strong adherence to prompt headings, but notable diffs in task description style/detail and minor formatting vs. GT warrant deductions under "utmost strictness" (total -2.0).
