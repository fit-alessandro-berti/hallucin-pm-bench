7.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (aligning with ground truth)**: Correct overall conclusion ("Non-compliant"). Accurately identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with appropriate citations to events and rule specifics. Justification is numbered, cites relevant rules, and explains the issues clearly and concisely.
- **Weaknesses/Differences (deducting points under strict criteria)**: 
  - Fails to evaluate all rules exhaustively (ignores Rules 1, 4, and 5, which are satisfied in the ground truth). This omits a comprehensive analysis, creating a structural difference despite the question's focus on "relevant rules" (interpreted strictly as all rules for full compliance assessment).
  - Small but factual error in Rule 3: States "distance 4" (from event 6 to 10), while ground truth specifies "distance = 3" (likely counting intervening events as 3: #7, #8, #9). This is a minor calculation inaccuracy, but per instructions, it warrants significant deduction (~1-2 points).
  - Phrasing is slightly less precise (e.g., "order is reversed" in ground truth vs. LLM's "after shipping"; no bolding or full rule satisfaction details).
- **Overall**: High fidelity on core violations and outcome (80% match), but incompleteness and the distance error prevent a top score. Strict deduction for gaps and small errors brings it to 7.0.
