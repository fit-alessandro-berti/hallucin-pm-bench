6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1 (Accuracy of Count)**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). No errors. Full marks here.
- **Part 2 (Explanation Quality)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the small sample size as a source of misestimation and notes potential underestimation of prevalence, staying under 120 words. However, it lacks depth and precision compared to the ground truth: misses quantitative sampling volatility (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals), extreme error for rare events, and the confounding factor of near-synonyms (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. strict/fuzzy matching issues). The explanation is superficial, focusing on volume/timing without addressing statistical unreliability or matching pitfalls, leading to incomplete insight. Significant deductions for omissions under strict criteria. Overall, partial credit for core idea but major gaps reduce score.
