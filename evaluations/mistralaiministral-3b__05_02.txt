The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth: it provides no actual unified diff (instead pasting the unchanged full XML, violating the single-hunk format), proposes an entirely different and unimplemented improvement (reversing a sequence flow, which isn't reflected anywhere and isn't the ground truth's attribute modification), delivers an incorrect rationale that ignores the 3-day SLA context and due-date adjustment, and overall disregards the rules by not modifying an existing element properlyâ€”resulting in zero alignment with the expected output.
