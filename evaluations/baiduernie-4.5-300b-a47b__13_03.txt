7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect matchâ€”correct count of 1, with accurate reference to the data. No speculation or errors. (10/10)
- **Question 2**: Directionally sound (small sample, potential naming issues lead to misestimation), stays under word limit (~105 words), and avoids outright fabrication beyond the prompt's data. However, strict deduction for: (1) speculation on unrelated naming variations (e.g., inventing "Manual Review for Fraud," violating "no speculation" rule); (2) failure to leverage actual log data (e.g., no mention of real near-synonyms like "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"); (3) generic phrasing (e.g., "noise, edge-case filtering") without ground truth's precise statistical focus (e.g., frequency swings, confidence intervals); (4) less rigorous emphasis on sampling error for rare events. These differences reduce fidelity to the ground truth's data-driven precision. (5/10)

Overall: Strong on accuracy for Q1, but Q2's deviations warrant significant penalty under strict criteria, averaging to 7.5.
