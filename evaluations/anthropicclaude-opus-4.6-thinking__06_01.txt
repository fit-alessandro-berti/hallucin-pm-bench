9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core output (pairs list)**: Perfect match (100%). Exact pairs, alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" before "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"), format, spacing, and code block identical to ground truth.
- **Structure/Formatting**: Minor deductions (-0.5). Extra bold title ("**Parallel pairs in Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder**") not present in ground truth, which starts directly with the list. Headers differ slightly ("**Reasoning:**" vs "*Rationale*").
- **Content Accuracy**: Excellent, but slight deductions for paraphrase vs. direct quotes (-0.3). LLM accurately interprets (e.g., "run simultaneously until the synchronisation point") but adds interpretive phrasing not in ground truth's verbatim quotes (e.g., “begin **in parallel** right after Fabricate”; “may run simultaneously”). Ground truth sticks closer to prompt text.
- **Completeness**: Matches exactly on identifying only the two pairs and explaining no others (-0.0).
- **Strictness adjustment**: High score reflects near-identical functional output; small extras/wording variances deduct conservatively per "significant loss for small errors," but not penalized as "errors" since correct and helpful.

Overall, outstanding adherence, minimal diffs.
