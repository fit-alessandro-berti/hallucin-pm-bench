6.0

**Assessment:**

**Terminology:**  
- The answer successfully uses only the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") and does not mention forbidden alternatives. **(No error.)**

**RACI Role Assignment Accuracy & Strictness:**  
_Substantial errors compared to the ground truth:_
- The answer assigns multiple R/A/C/I to several roles per activity, while the ground truth assigns a **single "R" and "A"** (sometimes as "R/A") per row, with clear "C"s and "I"s. For example:
    - "Receive Application": The answer assigns only AM as R, A (good), but ground truth explicitly also gives C to CO, I to FC/IT — these are omitted.
    - "KYC Review": Ground truth makes AM "A", CO "R", FC "C", IT "I". LLM answer does "CO R,A", "AM C,I", nothing for FC or IT. *Misses FC as C and IT as I.*
    - "Order Vetting": Similar errors — ground truth has AM "R/A", CO "C", FC+IT "I", while LLM answer adds CO "C" (ok), FC "I" (ok), but for other tasks the mapping is looser and more diffuse.
    - Throughout, the LLM is inconsistent about Info/Consulted, and rarely matches ground truth exactly. For example, "Record Update" in the LLM shows AM "I", FC "C", while ground truth is AM "C", FC "C", CO "I", IT "R".

**Formatting:**
- Uses a readable markdown table, but introduces a "Legend" and key points below. **Unwarranted**—the prompt does not ask for this, and the ground truth is strictly tabular. (Minor format fault.)

**Extra Content:**
- The narrative explanations below the table are not asked for. Adds unwarranted explanations and details about consultation and notification logic, which are **not** requested.

**Summary:**  
- The LLM answer follows the vocabulary rule and generally captures the right general sense of roles, but diverges notably from ground truth:
   - *Multiple severe strictness violations in precise assignment of C/I/A across the board.*
   - *Extra content harms score due to over-completeness and violating "no extra" policy.*
   - *Formatting not as strict as ground truth.*

**Therefore, even though the LLM is correct in terminology and overall sense, the mapping lacks strict precision and format fidelity. These are major demerits per the scoring guidelines (“significant loss of points” for small errors; “the more differences ... the lower the grade”). Thus, 6.0 is fair and strict.**
