3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy, using "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with no forbidden terms appearing. This earns baseline credit for terminology (worth ~2 points). The table structure is appropriate (activities as rows, roles as columns, no extra tasks/roles/columns), and it includes a standard RACI legend, aligning with the prompt's intent.

However, under strict evaluation criteria emphasizing closeness to the ground truth (GT), the RACI allocations show significant deviations, warranting major point deductions:
- **Receive Application**: Partial match (AM: R/A correct), but misses CO: C, FC: I, IT: I (blanks instead of explicit entries). Deduct 1.0.
- **KYC Review**: Major mismatches—AM: C,I (GT: A only, no C/I); CO: R,A (GT: R only, A belongs to AM); misses FC: C, IT: I. Wrong accountable and extras. Deduct 1.5.
- **Order Vetting**: Mostly matches (AM: R/A, CO: C, FC: I), but misses IT: I (blank). Deduct 0.5.
- **Payment Clearance**: Mismatches—AM: C (GT: A); misses CO: C; FC: R,A (GT: R only, A belongs to AM). Wrong accountable and missing consultation. Deduct 1.5.
- **Record Update**: Mismatches—AM: I (GT: C); misses CO: I; FC: C correct but IT: R,A (GT: R only, unwarranted A). Wrong accountable/informed. Deduct 1.0.
- **Notify Customer**: Partial match (AM: R/A), but misses CO: I, FC: I, IT: I (blanks). Deduct 1.0.

Each activity must have exactly one Responsible (mostly correct here, +0.5 partial credit), but Accountable assignments are inconsistent with the narrative (e.g., AM should be A where appropriate as per process flow; LLM shifts A erroneously to CO/FC/IT in multiple cases). This violates GT correctness on allocations.

Unwarranted content deducts further: The LLM adds a header ("Updated Process"—not in prompt/GT), detailed "Key points" explanations (GT has none), and per-activity breakdowns, introducing interpretive text beyond the matrix. This bloats the response without adding value, per notes on no extras (+0.5 partial credit for not adding structural elements).

No self-awareness issues. Overall, ~60% alignment on core matrix but eroded by precise mismatches and extras; strictness caps at 3.5 (far from 10.0 due to cumulative small-to-medium errors).
