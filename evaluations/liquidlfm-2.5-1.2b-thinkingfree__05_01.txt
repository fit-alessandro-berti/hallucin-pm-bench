**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and unrelated to the SLA. It vaguely suggests misusing non-time-based conditions on irrelevant flows (f2: Receive→Check; f9: Notify→End), which cannot enforce a 48-hour timer to reach Task_Triage. No timer event, boundary event, or flow reconnection is proposed—violating the core requirement. "Early alerts" ≠ auto-escalation to Triage. Zero alignment with ground truth; pure fabrication.
