7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part 1 (Count):** Perfect match—both identify exactly 1 occurrence (Case 1002). No deduction.

**Part 2 (Explanation):** Strong overall alignment on core issues (small sample size/N=3, short timeframe <2 hours, lack of representativeness for full month, naming inconsistencies causing underreporting via strict matching). Both under 120 words (~110 for LLM). However, strict deductions for:
- Speculation violation: LLM hypothesizes unshown manual variations (e.g., "Man. Fraud Check" or "Manual Verify") and "morning workloads," exceeding "strictly from the data provided—no speculation." Ground truth avoids this, sticking to observed automatic synonyms.
- Minor inaccuracy: LLM's 33% frequency (case-based) mismatches ground truth's event-based ~7% and emphasis on rare-event sampling error/confidence intervals; LLM's "statistical significance" is vaguer than ground truth's precise "extreme sampling error" and "wide confidence interval."
- Ground truth is tighter on distortion risks (strict vs. fuzzy matching).

These flaws (speculation + imprecision) warrant a 2.5-point loss from 10.0 despite solid structure and insight.
