**10.0**

The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth in content, structure (one concise explanatory sentence), accuracy, and completeness: both correctly identify the absence of timestamps/time data as the sole barrier, reference only event counts, and target the specific activity. Minor stylistic variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; phrasing of time differences) are not errors and do not warrant deduction under strict factual evaluation.
