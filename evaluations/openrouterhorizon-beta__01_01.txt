### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, ~40% of Score Impact)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points, including the eligibility validation (which implicitly branches to rejection if invalid, as it's a core "check" in the process description), the amount threshold, and the final approval/rejection before payment. The LLM answer only covers the amount threshold (high-value branch) partially and accurately but entirely omits the other two. This is a critical incompleteness, as the prompt requires summarizing *every* decision point. Strict deduction for missing ~2/3 of the required content, with no acknowledgment of rejection paths or final approval.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Strengths with Flaws, ~30% of Score Impact)**: The LLM correctly lists all seven documents from the process description without introducing extras, matching the ground truth's catalogue. However, it adds unprompted details on usage/context (e.g., "submitted in...", "checked in..."), which slightly deviates from the simple "list all required documents" instruction. It also fails to note the conditional nature of the AuditTrail (as "only for high-value branch, but still part of the catalogue"), reducing precision. Minor deduction for extras and omission of nuance, but no major errors.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor Issues, ~30% of Score Impact)**: The LLM's response is clear and adheres to the "do not introduce" rule (no legacy activities or undefined elements), but it lacks the ground truth's structured table format, explicit rejection outcomes, and closing note on the process scope. This results in a less comprehensive and precise summary. Strictness applied: even these formatting/nuance gaps compound the core omissions, preventing a higher score.

Total score reflects high strictness: substantial content gaps in the primary task (decisions) outweigh the solid document list, leading to a low passing grade.
