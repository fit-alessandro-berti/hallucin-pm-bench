4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Compliance (Strength, +2.0 points)**: Perfect adherence—uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with no forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). This aligns fully with the prompt's strict vocabulary policy and ground truth.
- **Structure and Format (Partial, +1.0 point)**: Basic table format is present with correct activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks or roles added. However, role headers include unwarranted abbreviations (e.g., "(AM)"), while ground truth uses full names only. No bolding for key assignments as in ground truth. Legend is mostly accurate but introduces simplification notes (e.g., "A not assigned", "I not used; all non-R are C") that contradict standard RACI and add unwarranted explanation.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Flaws, -4.0 points from base)**: Only partial match to narrative and ground truth.
  - Responsible (R): Correct in all 6 activities (one per row, matching performers: AM for Receive/Order/Notify; CO for KYC; FC for Payment; IT for Record).
  - Accountable (A): Completely missing across the board. Ground truth assigns A (often R/A) to AM in 5/6 activities (Receive, Order Vetting, Notify, plus A-only in KYC and Payment) to reflect ownership/initiation per narrative. LLM treats these as nothing or C, failing to "reflect the narrative" where AM is accountable.
  - Consulted (C) vs. Informed (I): Systematic error—LLM defaults all non-R to C (12 instances), but ground truth uses I for non-participants (10 instances, e.g., IT/FC in Receive/Order/Notify; CO in Record/Notify). This misrepresents involvement (C implies input needed; I means post-notification only), with no justification in prompt. Only 2 C assignments match exactly (CO in KYC/Order; FC in KYC).
  - Ground truth has ~70% cell mismatches or partials (e.g., KYC AM: C vs. A; Payment IT: C vs. I; Notify all non-AM: C vs. I).
- **Unwarranted Content (Penalty, -1.0 point)**: Extra legend and "✅ Terminology compliance" section introduce self-referential notes not requested or in ground truth, violating "no extra... content" per rubric.
- **Overall Strictness**: Base score starts at 10 for full match; deductions for multiple per-cell errors (missing A is a core RACI omission; C/I swaps alter process semantics). Narrative-driven accountability and I distinctions are not reflected, leading to significant loss despite terminology win. No self-awareness issues, but rubric emphasizes precise RACI fidelity.
