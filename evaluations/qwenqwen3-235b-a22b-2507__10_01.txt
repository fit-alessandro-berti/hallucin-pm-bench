4.5

**Assessment:**

**Terminology compliance:**  
Full marks for using required terms exactly ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") and not mentioning forbidden terms.

**Correctness — RACI Application:**  
* The ground truth formatting includes both R and A where applicable (e.g., "R/A"), and correct distinctions between C (Consulted) and I (Informed), varying by activity.
* The LLM's answer instead marks all non-R roles as "C", ignoring the distinction between Consulted and Informed present in the ground truth. This is a significant loss of rigor.
* The LLM answer omits any explicit use or assignment of "A" (Accountable), even when it is appropriate and present in the ground truth ("R/A" for Account Manager in several steps, "A" for KYC Review and Payment Clearance).
* Oversimplifies RACI: The note claims this is “typical RACI simplification”, but the user's instruction does not authorize simplification and explicitly requests **strict** mapping to the description.
* "R" is sometimes applied incorrectly: For example, in "Receive Application", only AM should be R/A, not others as C; in LLM answer, all others are C, not matching their role (should be I for some). This error repeats for most activities. Only one "R" per row is required by ground truth, but LLM matrix gives sometimes spurious "C" and never "I".
* Column headings are correct (role spellings and abbreviations).

**Unwarranted content:**  
No extra rows/columns, and activities are correctly mapped and ordered.

**Self-awareness extraneous:**  
The answer appends a summary of its own compliance, which was not requested, but this is a minor issue.

**Strict marking (as per instruction):**  
- Serious error in not distinguishing C and I for non-primary roles (significant deductions).
- Serious error in failing to assign "A" where appropriate (and for "R/A").
- Some “C” assignments are not warranted.
- Slight formatting difference (+/-) but not a point of deduction.

**Summary:**  
Almost all mappings outside of required terms are incorrect — much too flat a RACI (too many "C", no "A"/"I"). Strictness demands a large deduction for ignoring role distinctions and assignments, though terminology policy gets full marks.

**Final:**  
4.5/10 (losses: ≈2 for RACI errors across all activities, ≈2 for omission of "A", ≈1.5 for ignoring "I" and using only "C", ≈0.5 for superfluous compliance note).
