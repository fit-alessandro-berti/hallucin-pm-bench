4.5

### Key Differences from Ground Truth (Strict Evaluation Breakdown):
- **Added Tasks**: IDs correct, but parentheses contain **task types** (e.g., "(ServiceTask)") instead of **names** (e.g., "(Automated Fraud Check)"). Prompt explicitly requires "the `name` in parentheses". Wrong type for Task_NotifyCustomer (says SendTask, XML shows sendTask but name is required). No bullet formatting (`-`). Significant content error (-2.0).
- **Removed Tasks**: ID correct, but "(UserTask)" instead of name "(Manual Review)". Same format violation (-1.0).
- **Gateway Type Changes**: First gateway correct. Second gateway **factually wrong** (v1: exclusiveGateway → v2: parallelGateway; it *did* change). Adds forbidden commentary "(no change, both exclusive → parallel; no difference)", violating "list only verifiable differences" and "add no commentary". Uses `:` instead of `-` alignment. Major factual + rule violation (-2.5).
- **Overall**: Headings verbatim/correct order. No extra elements mentioned. But cumulative strict errors (wrong content in 5/5 task lines, 1/2 gateways wrong + commentary, missing bullets) make it substantially divergent. Half-credit for identifying most changes despite flaws.
