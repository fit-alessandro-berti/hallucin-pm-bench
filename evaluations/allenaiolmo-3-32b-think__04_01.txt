The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and precisely cites the two violated rules (2 and 3) with accurate event references and reasoning matching the ground truth violations. Format aligns well with the prompt's specified structure (Non-compliant + numbered justifications citing relevant rules, interpreted as violated ones). Minor deductions for: (1) incomplete audit (omits explicit verification of satisfied Rules 1, 4, 5, unlike ground truth's full 1-5 breakdown); (2) slight phrasing discrepancy on Rule 3 distance ("four activities after" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"), a small but notable difference under strict criteria; (3) lack of ground truth's detailed satisfaction explanations, summary phrase, and formatting (e.g., no "Justification" header or bolding).
