6.0

The LLM answer identifies the high-value amount threshold as a decision point and correctly lists all the required documents without introducing any additional artefacts or activities. However, it misses **two major decision points** clearly required by the prompt and shown in the ground truth:

1. **Eligibility decision during Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** (whether the claim is eligible — ground truth decision point 1)
2. **Final approval decision after Finance_Controller_PreApprove/Senior_Auditor_Review** (the possibility of rejection at this stage — ground truth decision point 3)

The LLM answer conflates the process flow and does not mention the possible rejection or ineligibility paths, which are explicit decision points in the process. 

On the positive side, the LLM answer does not invent any steps or documents and covers the branching amount threshold decision accurately, presenting document usage clearly and concisely.

Omission of two out of three key decision points, however, is a significant shortcoming, reflecting in a strict scoring of **6.0**. Further deductions would not be justified since all artefacts and the principal high-value branching are correctly provided.
