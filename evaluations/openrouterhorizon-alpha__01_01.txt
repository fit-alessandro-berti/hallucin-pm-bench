3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially addresses the prompt but demonstrates significant omissions and inaccuracies when compared to the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Here's a breakdown:

#### Decision Points (Major Deficiencies, ~60% of Score Weight)
- **Completeness**: The ground truth identifies **three explicit decision points** derived from the process: (1) eligibility validation in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** (eligible vs. rejected), (2) amount threshold after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** (> €1,000 vs. ≤ €1,000), and (3) final approval at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** / **Senior_Auditor_Review** (approved vs. rejected, impacting payment). The LLM only captures **one** (the high-value branch, equivalent to ground truth #2), missing the eligibility check (#1) and final approval (#3). This is a critical failure to "summarise **every** decision point," as the process description implies validation and approval steps involve binary decisions (e.g., "checks the claim" in step 2 suggests eligibility rejection; "signs off" in step 3 and constraints imply possible rejection).
- **Accuracy and Structure**: The LLM's single decision is correctly described with branching logic, but it inaccurately places the high-value check "after Finance_Controller_PreApprove" in the ground truth (LLM implies it during triage/finance without specifying timing precisely). No table or numbered structure as in ground truth, reducing clarity. Omissions alone justify a ~70% deduction here.
- **Strictness Note**: Even implicit decisions in the process (e.g., validation success/failure) must be inferred and included per the prompt's call for "every" point; ignoring them is not a minor error but a substantive gap.

#### Required Documents (Minor Strengths, ~40% of Score Weight)
- **Completeness**: Matches the ground truth list exactly (RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF). Correctly notes AuditTrail's conditional use for high-value claims, aligning with ground truth's caveat.
- **Accuracy**: Ties documents to activities appropriately (e.g., AuditTrail to Senior_Auditor_Review). Implicitly adheres to "do not introduce any activities or artefacts" by excluding undefined items like the legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide."
- **Structure and Extras**: Lists them clearly but lacks the ground truth's numbered format, conditional note for AuditTrail as "part of the catalogue," and explicit disclaimer about no other documents/legacy activities. This is a small formatting/nuance error, costing minor points but not as severe as decision omissions.
- **Strictness Note**: Perfect match in content, but minor deviations in presentation (e.g., no catalogue note) reflect ~10% loss.

#### Overall Assessment
- **Alignment to Prompt**: Covers ~33% of decision points accurately but fails on exhaustiveness; documents are solid. No introduction of extras, which is positive.
- **Strict Scoring**: With "utmost strictness" and "small errors" causing "significant loss," the major omission of two decision points (core to the prompt) dominates, pulling the score down substantially from a potential 7.0 (for partial correctness). A 3.5 reflects ~35% overall fidelity: credit for the one decision and full documents, penalized heavily for incompleteness. Higher scores would reward near-exact matches; this is not one.
