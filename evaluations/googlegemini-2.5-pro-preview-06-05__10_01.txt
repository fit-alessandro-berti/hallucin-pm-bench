6.0

**Detailed Evaluation:**

**Terminology (Strict Vocabulary Policy):**
- The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance." Never uses forbidden terms. **(No deduction here.)**

**RACI Allocations:**

1. **Receive Application**
   - **Ground truth:** AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = I, IT = I
   - **LLM:** AM = R/A, CO = I (should be C), FC = (blank, should be I), IT = (blank, should be I)
     - ❌ Missing C for CO, missing I for FC and IT. LLM also only marks CO as Informed, not as Consulted. Major omissions.

2. **KYC Review**
   - **Ground truth:** AM = A, CO = R, FC = C, IT = I
   - **LLM:** AM = I (should be A), CO = R/A (not separate—should be R for CO, A for AM), FC = (blank, should be C), IT = (blank, should be I)
     - ❌ LLM collapses R and A for CO which is incorrect, misses FC entirely, gives AM the wrong code (Informed rather than Accountable), omits IT.

3. **Order Vetting**
   - **Ground truth:** AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = I, IT = I
   - **LLM:** AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = (blank, should be I), IT = (blank, should be I)
     - ❌ Misses Informed marks for FC and IT.

4. **Payment Clearance**
   - **Ground truth:** AM = A, CO = C, FC = R, IT = I
   - **LLM:** AM = A, CO = (blank, should be C), FC = R, IT = (blank, should be I)
     - ❌ Missing C for CO, I for IT.

5. **Record Update**
   - **Ground truth:** AM = C, CO = I, FC = C, IT = R
   - **LLM:** AM = A (should be C), CO = (blank, should be I), FC = (blank, should be C), IT = R
     - ❌ Wrong for AM, missing others.

6. **Notify Customer**
   - **Ground truth:** AM = R/A, CO = I, FC = I, IT = I
   - **LLM:** AM = R/A, CO = I, FC = I, IT = (blank, should be I)
     - ❌ Missing I for IT.

**RACI Legend:** Correct, but that's peripheral.

**Summary of Issues:**
- Major and pervasive omission of C and I contributions.
- In several activities, collapses Responsible and Accountable onto the wrong role (e.g., "KYC Review").
- Inconsistent and incomplete population of matrix cells, with information frequently left blank.
- No forbidden vocabulary used (good).
- No extra tasks or roles (good).

**Strictness Score:** The LLM answer preserves the required vocabulary but has extensive RACI allocation issues, especially the consistent omission of Consulted and Informed parties and, in some rows, misallocation of Responsible/Accountable roles. While it gets the main Responsible/Accountable actors mostly correct for some activities, the lack of C/I is a serious gap. Because of strict grading, these recurring errors warrant a severe markdown, but the correct terminology and somewhat correct structure prevent a failing grade.

**Final: 6.0 (Below average due to RACI allocation errors, but not a total failure due to correct terminology and attempt at structure).**
