6.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct status and valid justifications (≤20 words) for R1, R3, R4, R5, R6. Overall result correct (NON-COMPLIANT). Format closely matches prompt (list style, concise).
- **Major errors (significant deduction)**: R2 completely wrong—status **Compliant** vs. ground truth **Violated**; justification ignores change request's impact (new Manager_Approval on 03-07 as "last required approval"), failing to recognize Ship_Goods precedes it (not "within 2 days after"). This is a critical reasoning failure linking R5 to R2, misidentifying the relevant approval.
- **Minor differences**: R1/R5 justifications vary in wording/detail (e.g., R5 omits Pay_Invoice but still valid); date abbreviations (e.g., "Mar 5") vs. full dates; no bolding (**Compliant**). Strict policy penalizes even these.
- **Strict scoring**: 5/6 rules correct = ~83% accuracy, but one major status/reasoning error + minors = 60% effective (6.0). Perfect match required for 10.0; no leniency per instructions.
