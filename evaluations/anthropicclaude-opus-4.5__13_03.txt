7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part 1 (Count):** Perfect match (both confirm exactly 1 occurrence in Case 1002). No deduction.

**Part 2 (Explanation):** Partial match (≤120 words, covers small sample size and naming inconsistencies with similar examples). However, significant deviations under strict criteria:
- Misses core ground truth emphasis: quantitative sampling error ("swings... from 0% to 7%", "wide confidence interval", "rare events... extreme sampling error").
- Adds non-ground-truth points ("temporal bias", "case-type distribution") diluting focus.
- Minor speculation ("'Manual Fraud Check' variant... may exist elsewhere"), violating "no speculation" despite context.
- Formatting/verbosity differs (bullets vs. paragraph), introducing unnecessary structure.

Overall: Strong alignment on facts but lacks precision/depth in statistical reasoning; extras reduce fidelity (-2.5 points).
