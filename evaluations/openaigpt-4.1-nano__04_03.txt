3.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately flags the violation of Rule 3 (NA occurring before RA). It also correctly assesses Rule 1 as satisfied. However, it commits a significant error by incorrectly claiming Rule 2 is violated, misinterpreting the trace order (VP does occur after both QE and RA) and confusing NA with RA in its reasoning. Rule 4 is assessed as conditionally satisfied but ultimately dismissed due to prior violations, which is imprecise but not entirely wrong. The justification format differs from the ground truth (narrative vs. table), and extraneous details (e.g., referencing VP in Rule 3) add confusion. Under strict evaluation, these errors—especially the factual misunderstanding of Rule 2—warrant a substantial deduction from a perfect score.
