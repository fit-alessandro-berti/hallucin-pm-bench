7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is mostly accurate but contains several deviations from the ground truth (GT), warranting deductions under strict criteria. Key differences:

- **Decision Points**:
  - Includes an extraneous point (1. Dual Underwriter Split), which GT explicitly treats as a precursor ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split") rather than a decision point. This adds unnecessary content and misaligns structure (LLM: 4 points; GT: 3 points). Deduction: -1.5.
  - In Underwriter Alignment Gate description, uses imprecise terminology ("Underwriter A and Underwriter B") instead of exact prompt/GT terms ("Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B"). Violates "use exactly the activity names given." Deduction: -1.0.
  - Otherwise, core logic for Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold, and MBA matches closely, including conditions and flows.

- **Required Documents**:
  - List is complete and in correct order, but contains small wording mismatches:
    - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)": GT shortens to "(≤ 3 months)," omitting "old."
    - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)": GT abbreviates to "(pay-stub/tax slip)," omitting "single."
    - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template": GT uses "(CIS)," omitting "template."
  - These are minor but accumulate as fidelity errors per strictness rule. LLM also lacks GT's optional closing note, but this is not required by the prompt. Deduction: -0.5 total.

- **Overall Structure and Style**:
  - Uses bullet points and bolding effectively, but introduces extra formatting (e.g., "###" headers, asterisks) not in GT, and phrases like "the process contains the following points where a specific action or review determines the subsequent flow" add interpretive text absent in GT's concise "#### Decision points" intro. Minor stylistic drift. Deduction: -0.0 (neutral, as prompt allows summarization).

The answer adheres to the no-standard-terminology rule and covers essentials without major omissions, supporting a mid-high score. Total starting from 10.0, deductions sum to -3.0.
