**7.5**

The LLM answer substantially matches the ground truth: it correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3, provides a valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5), and explains the enabling conditions. 

However, the answer is missing a *crucial detail*: it does not mention that **T5 can never fire after T3** (i.e., that T3 permanently disables T5), which is stated in the ground truth reasoning. Instead, it merely states "T3 could still fire later if needed," which—while not strictly wrong in terms of firing order—does not highlight the causal relationship and permanent disabling crucial to the net's logic.

Additionally, the LLM’s answer omits the step of firing T3 after T5 (as shown in the ground truth), and does not discuss that this is the *only* way in which T5 is possible: the answer could mislead a reader to think T5 might also be possible after T3 fires, or that T5 and T3 are independent.

**Strict deductions:**
- Fails to make explicit that once T3 fires, T5 is forever disabled—this is a key insight required for a complete answer. **(-2.0)**
- Firing sequence stops after T5, not explaining the full reachability nor what happens after, as in the ground truth. **(-0.5)** 

**No points deducted for calculation errors or misleading statements about markings, as the step-by-step markings are correct.**

**Conclusion:**  
A correct answer with full basic reasoning and the correct sequence, but omits an important logical relation (the *necessity* of T5 preceding T3 for T5 to ever fire). 7.5/10.
