The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3, provides an accurate firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) with precise markings and enabling conditions, and offers a brief but sound justification focused on the inhibitor arc's role when p4=0 (pre-T3). This aligns closely with the ground truth's core "yes" response, sequence, and key enabling logic (p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0). Minor deductions for slight verbosity/repetition in phrasing and less emphasis on the "must" exclusivity (that T5 is only possible pre-T3), but no factual errors—unlike the ground truth's invalid extension showing T4 firing post-T5 (impossible, as p3=0 after T5 consumes it). Overall, highly faithful to the prompt's requirements with strong accuracy.
