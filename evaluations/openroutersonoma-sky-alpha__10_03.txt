3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the core requirements but deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and formatting, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Added and mismatched activities (major deduction, -4.0 points)**: The prompt instructs to cover "every activity" without adding, renaming, or merging, but using the authorized vocabulary strictly for the four core terms. The LLM adds extraneous rows ("Schedule the payment" and "Notify the originating analyst") not present in the ground truth, and splits "Release Funds" into separate "Release the funds" and "Notify" rows, effectively adding/merging inconsistently. The ground truth consolidates into exactly 6 activities (4 core + "Compliance Officer Approval" + "Release Funds"), while the LLM uses 8, violating the "do not add" rule and introducing unsupported granularity.

- **RACI assignments (major deductions, -2.0 points total)**: Multiple inaccuracies across roles and activities compared to ground truth:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst (I vs. C), Treasury Ops (blank vs. I), Compliance Officer (blank vs. –). Front-Office Analyst matches (R, A).
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. –), Compliance Officer (blank vs. C), Treasury Ops (blank vs. I). Compliance Analyst matches (R, A).
  - **AML Screening**: Identical mismatches to KYC Review.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. C), Compliance Analyst (R, A vs. R), Compliance Officer (blank vs. A), Treasury Ops (blank vs. I). No full match.
  - **Compliance Officer approval/Approval**: Minor match (Front I, Compliance C, Officer R, A), but Treasury Ops (blank vs. –) and capitalization differ slightly.
  - **Release the funds/Funds**: Overly broad "I" assignments to Compliance Officer and Compliance Analyst (vs. C in ground truth); lacks precise Consulted roles. The "Schedule" and "Notify" rows have no ground truth equivalents, making all entries erroneous.

  These errors affect ~70% of cells in the core 4 activities, with small but strictly penalized discrepancies (e.g., I vs. C or blank vs. –) causing outsized loss as per instructions.

- **Formatting and presentation (minor but penalized deduction, -1.0 point)**: No bolding on activities or R, A entries (ground truth uses ** for emphasis). Blank cells instead of consistent "–" for no involvement. Minor naming inconsistencies (e.g., "approval" vs. "Approval", "the funds" vs. "Funds"). Table structure is Markdown-valid but lacks ground truth's polish and precision.

- **Strengths (partial credit, baseline +3.0)**: Correctly uses the 4 authorized terms exactly (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. Covers all roles. Basic RACI logic infers from narrative (e.g., Treasury R, A for execution steps), showing some understanding, but not enough to offset differences.

Overall, the answer captures the intent superficially but fails on fidelity to ground truth, with cumulative errors in addition, assignments, and details justifying a score well below average. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, extensive divergences halve or worse the value.
