6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Vocabulary compliance:**  
- The LLM answer uses only the correct authorized vocabulary (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”). No forbidden synonyms leak in the activity column or elsewhere. (+2)
- However, the activity names for “Compliance Officer approval,” “Schedule the payment,” “Release the funds,” and “Notify the originating analyst” are not as per authorized wording, and “Schedule the payment” and "Notify the originating analyst" should not be in the list. "Release the funds" should be "Release Funds" (minor, but still an error). “Compliance Officer approval” should be “Compliance Officer Approval” (capitalization/wording mismatch). (−1)

**Content accuracy / completeness:**  
- Extra activities (“Schedule the payment”, “Notify the originating analyst”) are present and not in ground truth. (−1)
- “Release the funds” is split into “Schedule the payment” and “Release the funds”, rather than a single authorized activity “Release Funds”. (−0.5)
- “Notify the originating analyst” is not an authorized activity. (−1)

**RACI assignments:**  
- “Consulted” and “Informed” do not match the ground truth. For example:
    - In “Intake Vetting”, ground truth says Compliance Analyst = C, Treasury Ops = I, but LLM says only Compliance Analyst = I (should be C), Treasury Ops blank (should be I). (−0.5)
    - For “KYC Review”, ground truth says Compliance Officer = C, Treasury Ops = I, but LLM only has Treasury Ops = I.
    - For “AML Screening”, same as above.
    - For “Risk Scoring”, ground truth says Compliance Officer = A (**only**), while LLM says Compliance Analyst = R, A (missing A for Compliance Officer), and Front-Office Analyst = I instead of C (wrong assignment). (−1)
    - “Compliance Officer Approval”: LLM says Compliance Analyst = C, FO Analyst = I, but ground truth says Compliance Analyst = C, FO Analyst = I.
    - “Release Funds”: LLM under-lists interaction, Treasury Ops = R, A (correct), but does not list Compliance Analyst or Compliance Officer as C, Treasury Ops has the wrong assignments for others. (−1)
- LLM did not use a dash (–) for “no involvement”.

**Markdown formatting:**  
- Table format is correct and acceptable.

**General:**  
- LLM did not rename, merge, or add activities (except for “Schedule the payment” and "Notify...", which are unauthorized additions).
- All roles are correctly labeled as columns.

**Summary:**  
- +2 for correct mandated vocab.
- −2.5 for extra activities, naming mismatches, and splitting/merging of activities.
- −2.5 for many incorrect RACI codes and assignments.
- −1 for minor errors (capitalization, using "I" where "C" was required, lack of dashes for "no involvement").

**Total:** 6.0 (strict).
