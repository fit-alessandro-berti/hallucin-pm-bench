8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of Conclusion (Non-compliant)**: Matches ground truth exactly. Full credit.
- **Identification of Violations**: Correctly identifies and explains Rule 2 (reversed order of Risk_Assessment and Ship_Goods) and Rule 3 (Three_way_match exceeds temporal window after Goods_Received). Matches ground truth on these core issues. Full credit.
- **Handling of Satisfied Rules**: Mentions Rules 1, 4, and 5 are satisfied in a parenthetical note, but does not provide explicit, numbered justifications for each as in ground truth (which details all rules systematically). This lacks completeness and structure, reducing points for thoroughness (-0.5).
- **Format and Phrasing**: Starts with "Non-compliant" and uses numbered justifications citing relevant rules, aligning with prompt. However, uses em dash in "Non‑compliant" (minor stylistic difference) and concise "for completeness" note instead of full per-rule breakdown (-0.3).
- **Small Errors**: In Rule 3 explanation, states Three_way_match is "four positions later" (from #6 to #10: positions 7,8,9,10), while ground truth specifies "distance = 3" (likely counting intervening events: #7,#8,#9). This is a minor inconsistency in distance calculation phrasing, but the rule violation and exceeding "≤2" are correctly concluded. Strict deduction for the discrepancy (-0.7).
- **Overall Strictness**: High fidelity (85% alignment), but deductions for reduced detail, structure, and phrasing error ensure strict evaluation. No major factual errors, but comprehensiveness gap prevents perfect score.
