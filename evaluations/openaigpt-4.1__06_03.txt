The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets from Process B in the required order, using accurate task names and without referencing Processes A or C, fully aligning with the prompt's core requirements. It loses a minor point for stylistic differences from the ground truth (e.g., comma separation instead of â€– symbol, lack of descriptive headers and backticks, absence of the optional closing sentence), but these do not impact factual accuracy or completeness.
