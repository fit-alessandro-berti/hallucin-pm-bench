3.0

The LLM answer makes an allowed change by reducing the due date, but it does so for the **wrong task** ("Sign Contract" instead of "Collect Equipment") and proposes values that do not match the optimal strategy in the ground truth. The ground truth focuses specifically on tightening the "Collect Equipment" duration to ensure contract-wide SLA adherence, which is a more effective and targeted intervention for the described issue. Moreover, the LLM answer also quietly increases the due date for "Prepare Contract" (from P2D to P3D), which is an *unjustified change* neither allowed by the prompt nor mentioned in the rationale, and could worsen SLA compliance.

Strictly following the evaluation criteria:

- **Major error:** The critical improvement target was wrong, leading to less effective SLA remediation.
- **Additional error:** An unrequested change (to "Prepare Contract") is silently introduced.
- **Rationale:** Correctly describes the modification’s intent, but for the less-relevant element.

These significant discrepancies result in a substantial point loss. The answer does not meet the precision or intent of the ground truth and introduces an error beyond the prompt constraints.

**Deduction summary:**  
- Wrong target: −3  
- Unjustified change elsewhere: −3  
- Rationale refers to incorrect task: −1  
- Correct diff syntax: +1  
- Only one improvement: +1  
- Minor errors, not fatal logic: +1  

**Total: 3.0**
