4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant), but justification factually incorrect ("within the limit" misstates amount > â‚¬10,000). Significant deduction for error in reasoning (-1.5 points).
- **R2**: Status wrong (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores post-change approval timing. Major analytical failure (-2.0 points).
- **R3**: Status nearly correct but uses "Non-Compliant" instead of "Violated" (prompt specifies exact terms). Justification accurate, but format deviation noted (-0.5 points).
- **R4**: Fully matches (status and justification equivalent). No deduction (+1.0 point baseline).
- **R5**: Status wrong (Compliant vs. Violated); justification reverses the timeline (change after approvals, further steps before new approval). Major analytical failure (-2.0 points).
- **R6**: Fully matches. No deduction (+1.0 point baseline).
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but derived from incomplete analysis (missed R2/R5 violations). Minor deduction (-0.5 points).
- **Format/General**: Lacks bolding/emphasis as prompted; no table but linear list acceptable. Word limits met, but strict adherence partial (-0.5 points).

Total: Starts at 10.0 baseline, deducts 7.0 for errors, yielding 3.0; adjusted +1.0 for partial correctness in R3/R4/R6/overall.
