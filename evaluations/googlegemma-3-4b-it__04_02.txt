3.0

Rationale for score:

- **R1**: LLM answer is correct in status (Compliant), but justification is inadequate—"within the limit" is misleading, as the amount is over the limit (but that’s allowed if approvals are in place). This is minor but not precise.
- **R2**: LLM says Compliant, but in fact, rule is Violated: shipment happened before the last required manager approval after the change, and was not within 2 days from that approval. This is a **major error**.
- **R3**: Correct status (Non-Compliant/Violated), with clear justification.
- **R4**: Correct and justified.
- **R5**: LLM incorrectly reports Compliant, but Pay_Invoice and Ship_Goods happened before the required new approval after the change request. This is a **major error**.
- **R6**: Correct and justified.
- **Overall result**: Correctly NON-COMPLIANT, but given serious errors above, this was by accident.

**Summary:**  
- 3 out of 6 rule statuses are wrong (R2 + R5 major, R1 justification weak)
- 3 answers correct (R3, R4, R6)

These are serious misinterpretations of the core rules with important compliance implications.

**Strict evaluation:** 3.0/10.0
