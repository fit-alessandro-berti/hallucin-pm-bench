**9.5**

The LLM answer is correct, complete, and demonstrates the required firing sequence accurately matching the ground truth in content, sequence (T1,T2,T7,T4,T5), and markings (equivalent sets, e.g., {P3,P2} = {P2,P3}). Both confirm T5 fires without T3 having occurred.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Stylistic differences: Compact inline markings vs. ground truth's numbered list with Mᵢ notation and bolded steps.
- Lacks ground truth's optional extra detail on T3 disabling post-T5 (insightful but not required).
- Slight phrasing variances (e.g., "T3 is not a causal predecessor" vs. "alternative path"; both valid but not identical).

No factual errors; highly faithful under strict evaluation.
