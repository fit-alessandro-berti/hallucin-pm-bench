9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, accurately identifying the non-compliance and referencing each rule. It clearly identifies that Rule 3 is violated because Notify_Authorities occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review. Each rule is referenced, and the logic aligns well with the gold standard reasoning.

Small error for point deduction: The justification for Rule 4 is somewhat wordy ("if NA and VP were correctly ordered, CC would be compliant with Rule 4"), whereas the ground truth is more direct in affirming Rule 4 is "âœ” Satisfied." Also, the LLM answer could be more concise and slightly clearer in its justification summary, but there is no error in factual content.

Thus, it earns a 9.0 due to minor verbosity and presentation differences, but with the correct overall compliance assessment and proper rule referencing.
