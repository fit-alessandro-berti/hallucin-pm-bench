The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences: the added tasks (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), the removed task (`send_rma_label`), and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`. No extra or missing items, no speculation.

However, with utmost strictness:
- Uses only `id` values instead of `name` values + `(id = ...)` as in ground truth (significant content difference; names are factual XML attributes).
- Different phrasing for gateway change (concise arrow vs. verbose "changed from ... (v1) to ... (v2)").
- Heading format (`###` + plain text) differs from ground truth (`**bold**`).
- Bullet style (`•` vs `*`).
- Lacks the final parenthetical note and backticks/formatting on ids/types.

Semantically perfect (10/10), but multiple presentational/content detail differences deduct 2.0 points.
