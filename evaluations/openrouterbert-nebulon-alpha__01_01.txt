**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision points (major discrepancies, ~50% match, heavy penalty)**:
  - #1: Close match in logic/location (eligibility check → proceed/reject), minor wording diffs ("proceed to Finance" vs "continue"; "reject" vs "rejected/returned"). Acceptable but not identical.
  - #2: Strong match (threshold after PreApprove → branch to Senior/skip). LLM's "directly to Process_Refund_Payment" slightly over-specifies vs GT's "skip auditor review" (implied but not explicit), small loss.
  - #3: **Fundamental mismatch**. LLM incorrectly locates decision at *Process_Refund_Payment* (checking *BankTransferAuthorization*, outcomes "execute/wait"). GT places it at *Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review* ("approved/rejected → payment/end"). LLM introduces non-decision precondition as "decision point" and "wait" (unmentioned in process), missing inferred approval/reject at core steps. This violates strict process fidelity and prompt to summarize *defined* points without introduction.
- **Documents list (~90% match, minor penalty)**: Identical 7 items, similar high-value note on *AuditTrail*. Missing GT's exact phrasing ("only for > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue"), final disclaimer ("No other documents or legacy..."), and italicized emphasis. Formatting as bullets vs numbered.
- **Overall structure/formatting (penalty)**: LLM uses ad-hoc ### headers/lists vs GT's precise table + numbered list. Introduces unsubtle interpretive phrasing (e.g., "Threshold Check", "Payment Authorization").
- **Strictness applied**: Significant content error in #3 (not small), format diffs, missing notes = halved score from partial matches. No hallucinations of new activities/artefacts, but mischaracterizes decisions.
