### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall: it correctly identifies three decision points (matching GT count), accurately summarizes branching logic for #1 and #2 with no inventions, lists **all 7 required documents identically** (including conditional note on *AuditTrail*), adheres strictly to the prompt by avoiding undefined activities/artefacts, and includes a compliance note. Structure is clear and prompt-compliant (summary + list).

**Strict deductions (-2.0 total):**
- **Third decision point framing mismatch (-1.5)**: LLM incorrectly locates "Payment Authorization" *at Process_Refund_Payment* (treating it as a decision with prereq check + *BankTransferAuthorization* execution condition), conflating execution gating with a discrete decision. GT precisely attributes "Final payment approval" *at Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review* (approved/rejected outcomes gating payment start per constraints). This is a meaningful interpretive error, not verbatim process-defined.
- **Minor wording/structure variances (-0.5)**: No table (GT uses); ineligible outcome "rejected (no further steps)" vs GT "rejected/returned"; "proceed to/skip to Process_Refund_Payment" vs GT "continue/skip auditor review"; slight verbosity (e.g., "low-value claims (≤ €1,000)"). Strict policy penalizes even phrasing diffs.

No other errors; excellent fidelity to process/constraints otherwise.
