The LLM answer accurately identifies all factual differences: two added tasks with exact IDs and names from the XML, one removed task with exact ID and name, and the precise gateway type change (from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway for the specified ID). It adheres strictly to the required headings without speculation or extraneous details. Minor deductions for presentation differences from the ground truth—such as listing tasks in a pseudo-XML style ("task id=...") instead of the cleaner "Name (id = `id`)" format, lacking version labels (v1/v2) in the gateway change, and not using bullet points or bolding—result in a small point loss under strict evaluation criteria.
