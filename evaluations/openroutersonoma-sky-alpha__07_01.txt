9.0

The LLM answer is overall accurate, with all items from the ground truth presented with no extra or missing changes claimed. However, there are some minor deviations in formatting, particularly in how the tasks are listed (as lines rather than a bulleted list using full names and ids as in the ground truth, and the parentheses differ). Also, in the gateway type changes, the LLM omits the explicit "from" and "to" format, and does not bold or otherwise set off the element types, unlike the ground truth. While these differences are minor, they reflect some loss of precision in matching the required answer style. According to the grading instructions, even such small errors should result in a significant point deduction, hence a 9.0.
