3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Format Adherence**: The LLM answer follows the required structure (status + â‰¤20-word justification per rule, all-caps overall result). Minor deduction for not using bold or table-like formatting as in ground truth, but not severe. (Score impact: -0.5)
- **R1**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, valid justification). Full credit.
- **R2**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification; ignores post-change new approval on 07-Mar, misidentifying last approval timing. Major error in sequence analysis. (-2.0)
- **R3**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification; reverses dates (Pay_Invoice 06-Mar before Receive_Goods 07-Mar). Clear factual error in chronology. (-2.0)
- **R4**: Matches ground truth (Not Applicable, valid justification). Full credit.
- **R5**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification; misses Change_Request (04 15:42) after initial approvals and pre-new-approval processing steps (Ship_Goods/Pay_Invoice). Critical misreading of events. (-2.0)
- **R6**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, valid justification). Full credit.
- **Overall Result**: Incorrect (COMPLIANT vs. NON-COMPLIANT); fails to account for multiple violations. (-1.5)

**Total Rationale**: 3/6 rules correct, but errors in R2/R3/R5 are fundamental misinterpretations of the event trace (dates, sequence, rule triggers), leading to wrong overall. Strict scoring penalizes inaccuracies heavily; partial credit for format and correct rules yields 3.0.
