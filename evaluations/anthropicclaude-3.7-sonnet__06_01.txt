The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and formats them one per line with the specified structure. This matches the core content of the ground truth output precisely, with no factual errors in task selection or sequencing.

However, under strict evaluation:
- The introductory sentence ("Here are all the task pairs...") adds extraneous text not present in the ground truth or requested in the prompt's output format, violating the "Output one pair per line" instruction (minor deduction: -0.5).
- The LLM omits the explanatory *Rationale* section provided in the ground truth, which justifies the pairs and confirms no others apply; while not explicitly required by the prompt, its absence reduces completeness relative to the ground truth (minor deduction: -0.5).
- Minor formatting discrepancy: The ground truth uses aligned spacing (e.g., multiple spaces before/after "—" for visual consistency, especially on the second line), while the LLM uses simpler spacing without alignment, slightly deviating from the example format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (negligible but noted under strictness).

No other differences; the answer is highly accurate overall.
