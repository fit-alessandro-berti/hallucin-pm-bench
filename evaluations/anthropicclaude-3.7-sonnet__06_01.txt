6.0

- **Positives:** The LLM correctly identified the two pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel, matching the underlying logic and meaning of the process.
- **Negatives:** There are formatting errors:
  - The pairs should have been printed with *two spaces* before and after the em dash, just as in the ground truth:  
    `Task_X  —  Task_Y`  
    Instead, the LLM used a single space and a regular hyphen (and in one case, possibly an en dash):  
    For example,  
    `Create_Documentation — Quality_Check`  
    rather than  
    `Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check`
  - The output is missing the code block formatting (```) that was present in the ground truth.
  - The pairs are not padded to align on the dash as the ground truth did, which leads to a slightly less clear presentation.
  - The instruction to return the pairs in **alphabetical order**, both *within* each pair and overall, is technically met, but the formatting misses strict requirements about the output template.
- **Strictness:** Even minor formatting mismatches are considered significant per task instructions.

**Summary:** The answer is logically correct, but small—even "superficial"—formatting deviations substantially reduce the score under your strict grading policy.
