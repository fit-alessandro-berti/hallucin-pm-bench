9.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, listing all correct changes under the correct headings and using the appropriate formats for each. There are, however, small differences:

- In "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES", the LLM omits the spacing in "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" after the colon (it has "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" rather than "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"). The ground truth uses extra spaces before "exclusive", indicating column alignment (which might be required verbatim).
- Other headings and task listings are formatted and ordered precisely as per the ground truth.

Because this difference is purely formatting (spacing for alignment, possibly required for strict verbatim matching), there is a small but non-trivial penalty, leading to a 9.0.
