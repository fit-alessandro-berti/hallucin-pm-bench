The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, correctly identifying all added tasks, the removed task, and both gateway type changes without any factual errors, additions, or commentary. However, under strict evaluation, minor formatting discrepancies result in a deduction: (1) extra blank lines after each heading (present in all three sections, violating the ground truth's immediate list placement); (2) lack of alignment spaces in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. ground truth's "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"). These small inconsistencies, though not affecting verifiability, warrant a significant but not severe point reduction given the otherwise precise adherence to the prompt's structure and requirements.
