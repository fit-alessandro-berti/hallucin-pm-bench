6.0

**Detailed evaluation:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer closely follows the structure of the ground truth. All required sequence flows and tasks are present; no extra activities or gateways are invented.
- Two exclusive gateways are used where required for split on password reset and outcome after diagnosis.
- Tasks generally correspond to described steps; the loop-back mechanism is correctly modelled.

**Significant Issues:**
- **Task Names:** 
  - The answer uses `"Classify System"` instead of the correct `"Auto-Classification"`, which is a semantic inaccuracy (“Classify System” implies a different action). 
  - Some task names use different wording: “Submit Support Ticket” instead of “Ticket Submitted” on startEvent; “Classify System” as above; “Diagnosis Outcome?” instead of “Resolved Internally?” for gw2, with poor semantic mapping.
- **Gateway Condition Labels:** 
  - Condition expressions use descriptive phrases (“Password Reset”, “Otherwise”, “Resolve Issue”, etc.) rather than Boolean-style “yes”/“no” as in the ground truth—which deviates from common BPMN practice.
- **Extra Gateway:** 
  - The LLM introduces an unnecessary third gateway (`gw3`) for customer confirmation—not present in the ground truth (which models confirmation directly by sequenceFlow from t6 to end/t3). The ground truth does not define a third exclusive gateway for confirmation; the LLM’s addition is an invention, mildly inflating the model.
- **Flow Order:** 
  - The sequence from “Forward to Specialist” (`t5`) goes to “Resolve Issue” (`t4`) as in ground truth, but in the LLM output, “Resolve Issue” is sometimes used after “Forward to Specialist”—consistently with the description, but the mapping is not as clear on naming and intent due to the task name discrepancy above.
- **Start and End Event Names:** 
  - LLM has `"Submit Support Ticket"` and `"Ticket Closed"` as names for the start and end events; GT uses `"Ticket Submitted"` and `"Ticket Closed"`—the start event name is not precisely correct.

**Other Issues:**
- **Namespace & Attributes:** 
  - Uses the default bpmn.io namespace and extra XMLNS attributes (& bpmndi/di/dc), which, while not wrong, are not required by the prompt and not included in the ground truth. 
  - GT sets `isExecutable="false"`, LLM sets it to `true`. This is minor, but a difference.
- **XML Declaration Absence:** 
  - LLM omits `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` (minor issue, but relevant for strictness).
- **Whitespace and Formatting:** 
  - Not strictly an error, but the ground truth contains no extraneous whitespace or unused lines.

**Summary of Point Deductions (out of 10):**
- Task name mismatches (multiple): -1
- Condition labels style and semantics: -1
- Unnecessary extra gateway: -1
- Namespace/structure/minor XML issues: -0.5
- Minor event name and attribute mismatches: -0.5

**Final Score: 6.0** (good structural mapping, but several semantic and technical deviations from the exact requirements and ground truth)
