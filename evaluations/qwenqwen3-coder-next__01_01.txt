**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major differences, ~40% weight)**: LLM identifies only 2 decision points (eligibility and high-value threshold), accurately summarizing the first two from ground truth but **completely missing the 3rd ("Final payment approval" at PreApprove/Auditor Review, with Approved/Rejected branches)**. This is a significant omission of "every decision point," as ground truth explicitly includes it as a core rejection opportunity implied by "succeeded" and "completed" in the process/constraints. LLM incorrectly assumes success ("after ... succeeds") without rejection branches, understating branching logic. Names/descriptions differ (e.g., "Eligibility Determination" vs. "*Eligibility check*"; verbose sub-details vs. concise table). Structure (numbered list with extras) diverges from ground truth table. Significant point loss for incompleteness and non-matching content/format.
- **Required Documents (minor differences, ~40% weight)**: Perfect match on all 7 documents listed (including conditional *AuditTrail*). LLM's table adds unrequested "Purpose" column with accurate-but-inferred explanations (e.g., "verify booking/status" for *FlightManifest* not explicitly in process), violating "Do not introduce ... artefacts not defined" spirit via extra details. Minor formatting divergence (table vs. numbered list), but list completeness earns partial credit. Note on no extras matches.
- **Overall (formatting/obedience ~20% weight)**: Excellent structure/readability, obeys no-legacy rule. No introduced activities. Verbose extras (triggers, purposes) inflate beyond "summarise ... and list," but not fabricated. Strict deduction for missing decision, extras, and imperfect alignment = 6.0 (solid but flawed/incomplete vs. ground truth).
