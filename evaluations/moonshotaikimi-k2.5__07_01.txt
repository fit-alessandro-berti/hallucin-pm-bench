The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, gateway `gw_valid` type change from exclusive to inclusive), uses the exact required headings with bullets as specified in the system prompt, and includes no speculation or extras. However, under utmost strictness:

- Task listings use only XML `id` attributes (correct per "element names" but differing from ground truth's format of name + `(id = ``id``)`), a significant presentation mismatch (-1.0).
- List bullets use `-` instead of `*` (-0.3).
- Headings include `•` as per instruction but ground truth uses plain `**bold**` without it (-0.3).
- Gateway phrasing is concise but not exact ("gw_valid (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway)" vs "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)") (-0.3).
- Missing ground truth's final note and markdown styling like backticks/bold (-0.1).

Semantic accuracy is perfect (10.0 base), deductions for format/content presentation differences total -2.0.
