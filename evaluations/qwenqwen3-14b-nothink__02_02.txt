10.0

The LLM answer fully matches the ground truth in content, structure, and precision across all questions: Q1 is exact (3); Q2 sequences the activities correctly in order with the specified separator; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities alphabetically, one per line, with no extras, omissions, or errors. Minor formatting differences (e.g., no bullets in LLM vs. ground truth) do not impact factual accuracy.
