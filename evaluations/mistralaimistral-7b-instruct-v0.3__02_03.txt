**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict assessment):
- **Q1**: Incorrect (claims "4 distinct cases" but lists only 3; ground truth is exactly 3). Major factual error → full deduction.
- **Q2**: Correct activity ("Pack_Items"), but verbose phrasing vs. ground truth's concise "Pack\_Items" → minor format/style deduction.
- **Q3**: Completely wrong (misinterprets scope as "for case C123"; picks "Create_Order" which appears 3x total, not 1x; ground truth is "Cancel\_Order" which appears exactly once). Major factual + scope error → full deduction.
- **Format**: Numbered sentences instead of concise bullets (e.g., "* **A1:** 3 cases..."); violates "concise, bullet-point answers only" → deduction.
- **Overall**: 1/3 correct, with formatting issues; strict policy demands ~67% loss per error, yielding low score.
