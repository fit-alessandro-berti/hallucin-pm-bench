9.0

- The LLM's answers are entirely correct in substance.
- The numbering and bullet format is slightly different than in the ground truth (using dash '-' and prose rather than asterisk and requested short notation), and places case labels in-line rather than parenthetical.
- Conciseness is very slightly less than ground truth (e.g., "are present:" vs. simply giving the cases), which warrants a minor deduction according to strictest grading.
- All information is accurate and unambiguous; only formatting and minimal verbosity differ.

**Strict deduction for not matching style exactly and for minimal verbosity differences: -1 point.**
