The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data for all four questions. No hallucinations, inferences, or deviations occur. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "1 time" vs. "1 occurrence"; implied uniqueness in Q3) are negligible and do not warrant point deduction under strict evaluation, as they preserve the factual intent and directly address the questions without error. Q4 provides two valid, clearly stated reasons from the specified categories (temporal bias and small sample size), with explanations aligned to the ideal examples.
