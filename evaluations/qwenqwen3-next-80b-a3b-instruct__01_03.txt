7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: Strong match overall (8.5/10). Both identify the two decision points correctly. The summaries capture the rules accurately and concisely, with only minor stylistic differences (e.g., naming of the first gate as "Outcome Gate" vs. "Risk-based skip"; redundant phrasing in the second rule about "majority"). No factual errors or omissions, but strictness deducts for not mirroring the ground truth's exact wording and structure (e.g., no quotes around “Approve”).
- **Part (b)**: Significant issues (6.5/10). The list includes all documents except "Signed Offer Sheet 77," which is explicitly named as a distinct required document in step 8 (first appearance there, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7). This omission shortens the list to 8 items instead of 9, violating the "all documents" requirement. The order of other items is correct, and inclusion of the scorecards (with justification) aligns well, but the error is not minor—it's a clear gap in completeness under strict evaluation. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML inventions).
- **Overall**: Deductions are weighted heavily for the b) omission (a core listing task) and minor a) variances, but the answer is otherwise faithful, precise, and structured without extraneous content.
