6.5

**a) Decision Points**

The LLM answer covers both decision points and is very close to the ground truth, with only slight discrepancies:

- For the Tri-Color-Risk-Check skip, the LLM's paraphrase matches the ground truth in logic and phrasing.
- For the TriVote, the answer captures both the required roles and the "two out of three" rule clearly and accurately.

Minor point lost: The LLM's wording ("passes only if at least two...approve; a majority...is sufficient") adds a tiny bit of surplus phrase not in the ground truth ("majority" suggests thinking in terms of three, but the process rule is specifically any two of three, even if someone abstains). However, this is a minor style point and doesn't change the rules.

**b) Documents**

- The LLM lists almost all documents, but crucially omits **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (which is required in step 8, per the ground truth answer).
- The LLM correctly includes Scorecards as documents (per process definition), and covers all others except the omission above.
- The order is otherwise fully correct.
- The justification after the list is helpful and shows understanding of document inclusion.

**Strictness evaluation:**  
Per instruction, “also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points.” The omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is significant: it is an explicit required document and its absence is a critical miss. This error alone should deduct at least 2 points. The rest is essentially correct, with a slight surplus in prose for (a), warranting another minor deduction.

**Conclusion:**  
A solid, highly-detailed answer, but the omission of one required document is a significant factual error. Therefore, a score of **6.5** reflects the otherwise strong coverage but with a significant penalization for incompleteness.
