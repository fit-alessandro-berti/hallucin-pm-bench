### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses only the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without any synonyms or leaks from the process narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment," "CDD," or "risk rating"). This aligns with the strict policy, earning some points.
- **Coverage of Activities (Major Deduction)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** described in the narrative. The LLM answer includes only the four core activities but omits two critical ones present in the ground truth: "Compliance Officer Approval" (escalation/approval step) and "Release Funds" (final release and notification by Treasury Ops). This is a failure to fully interpret and map the process, resulting in incomplete coverage. Strictness demands heavy penalty for omission.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction)**: Assignments are inaccurate across all activities:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Incorrectly assigns "I" to Compliance Analyst (should be "C"); misses "I" for Treasury Ops.
  - **KYC Review**: Misses "C" for Compliance Officer and "I" for Treasury Ops.
  - **AML Screening**: Misses "C" for Compliance Officer and "I" for Treasury Ops (ground truth shows "R, A" for Compliance Analyst, but context implies consultation).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Fundamentally wrong—assigns "R, A" solely to Compliance Analyst; ground truth has "C" for Front-Office Analyst, "R" for Compliance Analyst, "A" for Compliance Officer, and "I" for Treasury Ops.
  No coverage for the omitted activities means zero accuracy there.
- **Formatting and Structure (Minor Deduction)**: Markdown table is present and roles are not renamed/merged/added. However, it uses "-" instead of "–" (en dash) for no involvement, lacks bolding on activities and "R, A" entries, and does not fully represent involvement levels (e.g., no "C" or additional "I" entries). Small errors like this warrant point loss per instructions.
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the answer is ~25% accurate (correct terms and basic structure) but fails on completeness (missing activities) and precision (wrong RACI), leading to a low score. No evidence of adding/merging, but incompleteness is a critical flaw.
