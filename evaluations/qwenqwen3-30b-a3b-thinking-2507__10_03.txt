3.5

**Justification:**

The LLM answer demonstrates correct application of the required vocabulary—there are no disallowed synonyms present, and the four specified activities use only the permitted terms (“Intake Vetting,” “KYC Review,” “AML Screening,” and “Risk Scoring”).

However, the answer is significantly incomplete and inaccurate when measured against the ground truth:

**Major Errors:**

1. **Omitted Activities:**
   - The LLM answer only lists four activities; the ground truth matrix lists six (missing “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”).
   - As per instructions, the RACI should “cover every activity … described above” and not merge or omit. This is a severe omission.

2. **Incorrect Assignment of RACI:**
   - The assignments for Consulted (“C”) and Informed (“I”) are consistently missing or inaccurate.
   - For example, in Intake Vetting, Treasury Ops should be “I”; in Risk Scoring, Compliance Officer should be “A”, and so on.

3. **Lack of Nuance:**
   - Many roles are shown as “–” (no involvement) where the ground truth provides “C” or “I.”
   - Oversimplification damages accuracy.

**Minor Errors:**

- All matrix activities are written in the authorized vocabulary, which is correct.
- The format as a Markdown table is appropriate, though the actual content is insufficient.

**Severity of Penalties:**

- Omission of entire activities (2 out of 6 = 33% missing) is a fundamental flaw.
- Loss of “C” and “I” details distorts the intended governance depiction.

**Final Score Explanation:**

- *Strict grading* for process adherence and completeness mandates a steep penalty for missing activities and misassigned responsibilities.
- The correct use of authorized vocabulary and absence of forbidden synonyms prevent a score below 3.0.

**Thus: 3.5.**
