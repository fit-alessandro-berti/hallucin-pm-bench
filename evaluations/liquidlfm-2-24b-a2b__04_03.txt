**2.0**

The LLM answer reaches the correct final "No" but fundamentally fails in justification: it incorrectly claims Rule 3 is satisfied ("NA after QE and RA — OK"), missing the clear violation (NA occurs *before* RA in the trace: QE → NA → RA). Instead, it invents an irrelevant issue with `capture_event_details` (not mentioned in rules), hedges unnecessarily, and provides a convoluted, inaccurate analysis contradicting the ground truth's precise table. Rule 3 misassessment alone warrants major deduction under strict criteria; extraneous errors compound this to near-minimal score despite matching final verdict.
