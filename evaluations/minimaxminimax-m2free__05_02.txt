8.5

### Evaluation Notes
- **Core Improvement (10/10)**: The proposed change (reducing `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" for `Task_CollectEquipment`) exactly matches the ground truth, adhering to rules (modifies existing attribute, no additions/deletions, no flow reversal).
- **Diff Format (7/10)**: The unified diff shows the correct -/+ lines, but lacks proper unified diff hunk headers (e.g., `@@` lines as in ground truth), making it incomplete for a "single hunk" output; this is a format error deducting points under strict evaluation.
- **Rationale (8/10)**: Provides a one-sentence rationale as required, with similar intent (addresses delay in longest task, shortens cycle without disrupting structure). However, it differs in wording and specifics (e.g., emphasizes "total lead time by 3 days" vs. ground truth's "inside the contractual 3-day SLA"; omits "without introducing any new activities"). Not identical, so minor deduction for content variance.
- **Overall Structure (8/10)**: Mostly follows the two-part output format, but includes an unrequested introductory paragraph, violating the strict "Output format" by adding extraneous text. No other violations (e.g., no extra proposals).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Minor format and wording issues result in deductions, but high score due to alignment on the essential fix and brevity.
