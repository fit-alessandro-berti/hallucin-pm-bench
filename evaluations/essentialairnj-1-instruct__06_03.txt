5.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core correctness (high marks here, but capped due to extras):** Correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from the two parallel splits in Process B: {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory} and {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}. No incorrect tasks or references to A/C. (+4.0)
- **Format deviations (major deductions):** 
  - Ground truth uses clean numbered list (1., 2.) with bolded headers, descriptive labels ("first parallel block", "second parallel block"), backticks for task names, and ‖ symbol. LLM uses Python code/comments with indented "# Set X:", sets `{}` instead of lists/‖, no bold/backticks/‖. Prompt specifies "list each set... Number the sets" – LLM's code/print structure deviates significantly. (-2.0)
  - No explicit "No other tasks..." closing statement. (-0.5)
- **Unnecessary content (strict penalty):** Full reprint of Process B diagram in comments (not requested, adds noise). Python code/variables/prints/explanatory sentence are unprompted inventions, bloating response beyond "list each set". Prompt emphasizes focus ("Focusing only on Process B... give no information about Processes A or C" – implies minimalism). (-2.0)
- **Minor issues:** Redundant phrasing ("Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment" repeated); comma-separated instead of parallel notation. (-0.5)

**Total: 5.0** – Correct facts but substantial format/excess violations justify halving from perfect (strictness applied).
