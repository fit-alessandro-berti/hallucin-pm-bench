The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure (numbered responses matching the query), core conclusion ("cannot be determined/computed"), and reasoning (explicitly cites redacted timestamps/elapsed-times and lack of durations for computation). Minor deductions for: (1) slightly less precise phrasing ("cycle time" not re-emphasized as impossible without "temporal value per event"); (2) omission of "ordering information" and "fabricated" warning, which add nuance in ground truth; (3) "data provided" vs. "information provided" (trivial but strict criterion). No factual errors or fabrications.
