The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the exact two sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order they appear in Process B, with no extraneous information about other processes or tasks. This matches the core content of the ground truth perfectly. Deduction of 0.8 points for minor formatting/style differences: (1) plain comma-separated lists instead of `backticks` and ‖ notation for parallelism; (2) absence of descriptive headers like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"; (3) lack of the confirmatory "No other tasks..." sentence. These are small stylistic variances but warrant a strict penalty per instructions, though the functional accuracy remains excellent.
