The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" compliance, accurately assesses all four rules matching the ground truth (✔ for 1,2,4; ❌ for 3 with proper reasoning on NA before RA), and provides a short justification referencing each rule as prompted. Minor deductions for: (1) lack of table format and symbols (✔/❌) used in ground truth; (2) slightly less explicit phrasing in Rule 3 ("before Regulatory_Affairs_Review is complete" vs. ground truth's "before RA is completed; ... until both QE and RA"); (3) no explicit overall summary sentence like ground truth's "Because rule 3 is violated..."; (4) absence of bolding/headers for clarity. No factual errors, but format and phrasing differences warrant strict point loss per instructions.
