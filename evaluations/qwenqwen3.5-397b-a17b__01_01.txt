**6.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision Points (major differences, -2.5 points)**: LLM identifies 3 points, matching count, but summaries diverge significantly from ground truth phrasing, structure (prose vs. table with "# | Decision point | Branching logic / outcomes"), and details. 
  - Misses explicit rejection outcomes ("claim rejected/returned"; "process ends without payment") for eligibility and approvals—only implies for finance (-0.8).
  - Frames "High-Value Assessment" without exact "*Amount threshold* after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**" positioning (-0.5).
  - Splits "Finance Pre-Approval" separately but omits explicit decision/review at **Senior_Auditor_Review** (ground truth merges as "*Final payment approval* at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review**") (-0.7).
  - No branching logic table; less precise outcomes.
- **Required Documents (minor differences, -0.5 points)**: Lists all 7 exactly, accurate usages add value but deviate from plain numbered list. Misses "*only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue*" phrasing and final note "*(No other documents or legacy activities...)*" (-0.3). Verbose bullets vs. simple numbering (-0.2).
- **Overall Structure & Fidelity (-0.5 points)**: No table/--- separator; headers/### and prose don't match. No introductions of undefined elements (good), but not identical to ground truth.
- **Base**: Starts at 10.0; deductions for all differences per strict criteria (small errors like phrasing/structure = significant loss). Content ~85% aligned but not close enough for higher.
