2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
With utmost strictness, the LLM answer scores low due to numerous critical deviations from the ground truth, violating the prompt's core instructions and showing substantial mismatches in structure, content, and accuracy. Key issues include:

- **Added, renamed, and split activities (major violation)**: The prompt mandates covering "every activity and role described" using only authorized vocabulary for the four core terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring), without renaming, merging, or adding activities. The LLM adds four extraneous rows (Approval/Scheduling, Approval Submission, Approval Decision, Fund Release and Notification), unnecessarily splitting the approval and release processes. This contrasts with the ground truth's precise six activities (adding only "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" to interpret the narrative without excess). This alone warrants severe deduction, as it ignores "do not rename, merge, or add activities."

- **RACI assignments differ extensively**: Even for the shared core activities, assignments rarely align:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM assigns Compliance as I (wrong; ground truth has C and Treasury I, Officer –). Front-Office R,A matches, but others mismatch.
  - **KYC Review**: LLM misses Treasury I; assigns Officer C (partial match, but incomplete).
  - **AML Screening**: LLM omits Officer C and Treasury I; only partial Compliance R,A match.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM incorrectly gives Compliance full R,A and Officer C; ground truth has Compliance R only, Officer A, and adds Front C + Treasury I.

  The LLM's invented activities have no ground truth equivalents, making their assignments irrelevant and erroneous (e.g., splitting approval into three rows with inconsistent roles like Compliance R for submission but I for decision).

- **Formatting and minor inconsistencies**: No bolding on activities/roles as in ground truth; uses "-" instead of "–" for no involvement (small but penalized per strictness). Table structure is mostly Markdown-compliant, but extra rows bloat it unnecessarily.

- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit)**: Correctly uses the four mandated terms without synonyms or leaks (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). This is the only strong area, preventing a 1.0 score.

Overall, the answer captures ~25% of the ground truth's essence (core terms and basic RACI intent for 1-2 rows) but fails on fidelity, leading to a 2.0. Any alignment is superficial; differences dominate, reflecting poor adherence to the process narrative and RACI rules.
