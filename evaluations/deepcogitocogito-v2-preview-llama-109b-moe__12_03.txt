9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and thorough. It clearly answers "No," as required, and provides a step-by-step justification referencing every relevant CaseID and intervening activity, just like the ground truth.

Similarities:
- The answer is case-by-case, identifies the correct Cases (C002, C004) as counterexamples, and properly acknowledges that C001 and C003 conform to the rule.
- It clearly summarizes why the fact is inaccurate: the existence of one or more counterexample suffices to disprove the claim.

Differences/minor issues:
- The answer, though systematic, does not present its justification in the form of a table, which makes patterns slightly less immediately obvious compared to the ground truth.
- It could more explicitly state that "two out of the four cases violate the rule" (as in the ground truth), rather than having the user infer this fact from the detail given.

These are minor stylistic/presentation deviationsâ€”not substantive errors. Because the answer is fully correct, well justified, and based only on the evidence, but lacks the slightly more systematic tabular clarity and explicitness of the ground truth, a deduction of 1.0 is appropriate.

**Final score: 9.0**
