The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), demonstrating T5 firing before T3. The explanation accurately describes the token placements enabling T5 without T3 firing, staying under 120 words. Minor deductions for omitting intermediate markings (which enhance clarity in ground truth) and the detail on T5 consuming the P2 token to disable T3 (confirming irrevocability), resulting in slightly less comprehensive validation.
