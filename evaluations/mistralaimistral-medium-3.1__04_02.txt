The LLM answer correctly identifies all rule statuses and the overall result, matching the ground truth. However, justifications contain significant errors: R2 incorrectly calculates days (1 day from step 3 to Ship_Goods, not 3) and misses the new approval (step 8) as the relevant "last required approval" post-change; R3 relies on erroneous step ordering instead of dates; R5 omits Pay_Invoice from pre-approval steps. These factual and conceptual inaccuracies in three rules warrant major deductions under strict criteria, despite concise format adherence.
