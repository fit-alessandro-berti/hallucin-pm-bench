The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, correctness, and conciseness. Minor formatting variations (bullet style, numbering "1." vs "A1", presence of "distinct", underscore escaping) do not constitute errors in answering the prompt, as the substance matches perfectly and adheres to "concise, bullet-point answers only." No factual inaccuracies or omissions.
