9.2

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in all assessments (correct "No", all four rules correctly evaluated with matching satisfaction/violation status and core reasoning, e.g., NA before RA violates Rule 3). No factual errors. However, strict evaluation deducts for format differences (-0.5: bullets vs. table with ✔/❌ columns; -0.3: lacks explicit "overall non-compliant" summary sentence and table structure). Minor wording variations (e.g., "occurs once and precedes" vs. "appears once and precedes") are stylistic but count as small differences under utmost strictness.
