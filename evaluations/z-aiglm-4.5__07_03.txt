The LLM answer captures all concrete functional changes specified in the ground truth, with correct ids and task names, as well as properly noting both gateway type changes.

However, it contains several formatting errors:

- It omits the required list formatting (hyphen and space before each item).
- Under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, it omits the indentation and alignment for "Gateway_Payment" (does not align the colon or indent as shown in ground truth).
- In headings, the LLM answer does not preserve the exact formatting (spacing, dashes) found in the ground truth.
- There are inconsistencies in the capitalization of headings (although minor, strictness is required).

These errors, though not affecting correctness or completeness, violate the explicit instruction that even small errors should reflect in significant point loss and the answer must be "utmost strict." Thus, a significant deduction applies.
