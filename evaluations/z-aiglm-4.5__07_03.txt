The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the two gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel; Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel), with exact IDs, names, and change descriptions matching the ground truth content. No extraneous commentary or unchanged elements are mentioned, fully adhering to the prompt's restrictions. However, under utmost strictness, the absence of bullet points (-) before each item in all sections represents minor formatting differences from the ground truth (which uses - for bulleted lists and minor alignment spacing in the second gateway entry), resulting in a small deduction for non-exact structural match despite the prompt not explicitly requiring bullets.
