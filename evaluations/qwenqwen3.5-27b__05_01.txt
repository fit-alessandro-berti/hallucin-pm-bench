**3.0**

The LLM answer differs substantially from the ground truth in critical ways: wrong attachment point (`Task_RequestDocs` vs. `Task_Receive`), incorrect/non-standard timer configuration ("elapsed time since Start_Claim" implies complex FEEL expression not specified, vs. simple `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`), lacks timer ID (`Timer_48h`), omits XML details and explicit new sequence flow ID reference, and fails to cover all paths to `Task_Triage` (only missing-docs branch vs. initial common path). Core mechanism (interrupting boundary timer to `Task_Triage`) partially matches, but functional inaccuracy and mismatches warrant major deduction under strict criteria.
