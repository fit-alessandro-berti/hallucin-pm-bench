The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and reasoning: correct "No" answer, exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all relevant CaseIDs (C001–C004), accurate activity sequences directly from the log, correct identification of immediate successors (or interventions by Pack_Items/Check_Fraud in C002/C004), and valid conclusion that "always" is violated by counterexamples. Minor presentational differences (bullets vs. table; slight Markdown arrow placement before italic notes, which does not alter readability or accuracy) do not constitute errors under the task criteria of Yes/No + justification citing CaseIDs/sequences. No factual deviations, omissions, or inaccuracies.
