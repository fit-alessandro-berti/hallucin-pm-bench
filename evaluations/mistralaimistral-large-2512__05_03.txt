### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Core Solution Correctness (High Match, +7 base)**: Both add an identical interrupting boundary timer (`cancelActivity="true"`) on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H` duration and route via sequenceFlow to the existing `Activity_AMReview`. This correctly uses the unused escalation without new activities and enforces the SLA functionally.
- **XML Differences (Minor Deduction, -0.5)**: IDs (`Timer_48h` vs `Boundary_LateCreate`; `Flow_09` vs `Flow_LateEscalation`), names (`"48h SLA"` vs `"48h breach"`), and lack of ground truth's explanatory comments (❶/❷) and italics (`*already present*`). IDs/names are arbitrary but non-matching; missing comments reduce clarity.
- **Justification Major Error (Significant Deduction, -3.0)**: LLM incorrectly calls it a "**non-interrupting** boundary timer" despite XML specifying interrupting (`cancelActivity="true"`). This is a factual BPMN error contradicting the XML and ground truth's "interrupting"; non-interrupting wouldn't cancel the task, failing to enforce completion. Wording also less precise (no bolds, "path" vs "task").
- **Other (No Further Deduction)**: Timer attachment approximates SLA start (end of `VerifyID` vs start of `CreateAccount`), but identical in both—negligible execution delay. One-sentence format followed. No whole-model repetition.

Overall: Strong technical match undermined by justification inaccuracy and formatting omissions; strict policy demands heavy penalty for BPMN semantics error.
