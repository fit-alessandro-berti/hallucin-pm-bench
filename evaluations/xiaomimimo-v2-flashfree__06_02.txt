The LLM answer is semantically and structurally identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names, order, numbering, and comma separation. Whitespace variations (e.g., single vs. potential double spaces after commas or trailing spaces) are cosmetic and do not constitute errors under the prompt's requirements, as no specific formatting beyond "separated by commas" is mandated. No extraneous content or omissions.
