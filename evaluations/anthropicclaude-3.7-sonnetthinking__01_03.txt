7.0

**Reasoning:**

a) *Decision Points:*

- The LLM answer captures both main decision points: (1) risk-and-amount-driven bypass of manual review, and (2) the TriVote approval rule.  
- On the TriVote, it states: "with any two approvals out of the three being sufficient for the loan to proceed." This is phrased correctly but does not specify in the summary that advancement requires approvals to be *recorded* ("record 'Approve'"), though that's minor.
- The conditions for the skip are accurately described.
- However, the LLM’s answer is slightly less precise about the *procedural effect* (e.g., the risk gate says “step is skipped” vs. “bypasses manual underwriting; otherwise proceeds to that review”) but the rule logic is essentially correct.
- Mild deduction for not clarifying that *otherwise the process proceeds to the review* (a slightly less clear conditional than ground truth).

b) *Document List:*

- The LLM omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77," which is an explicit required document (it's not the same as just "Offer Sheet 77"—the signature is substantive, as per process step 8).
- All other documents are listed, and none are hallucinated (good).
- "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is a significant omission since that is a required artifact for the confirmation step.
- The ordering of the remaining documents is correct.

*Summary:*
- Nearly correct on decision points, but with slightly less explicit conditional statements.
- Document list is missing a required artifact. This is a notable error per instructions to grade strictly for even small mistakes.

Thus, 7.0 reflects an answer that is generally accurate on structure and content, but suffers a substantive factual omission and some minor precision losses.
