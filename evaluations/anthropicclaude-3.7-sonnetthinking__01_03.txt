### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM correctly identifies and summarizes both decision points with accurate rules, closely matching the ground truth in content and structure (one sentence per point, clear conditional logic). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "any two approvals... sufficient to proceed" vs. "at least two... record 'Approve'") are negligible and do not warrant deduction.
- **Part (b)**: The list is mostly accurate, correctly sequencing 8 out of 9 documents by first appearance, with no hallucinations (e.g., no improper KYC/AML mentions). However, it omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document first appearing in step 8 (treating the signed version implicitly under the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" from step 7), which is a significant error under strict evaluation criteria, as it alters the completeness and order of the full set.
- **Overall**: High fidelity to the prompt and process description, but the document omission justifies a notable deduction (equivalent to ~11% incompleteness in the list), preventing a perfect score.
