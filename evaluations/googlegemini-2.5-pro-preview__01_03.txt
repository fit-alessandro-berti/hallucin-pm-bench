7.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM answer accurately describes both decision points (the conditional skip and the TriVote gate). The decision rules are conveyed clearly, without misleading phrasing, and match the ground truth answer. 
- Minor issue: The wording for TriVote (“if it receives approvals from at least two out of three...”) is not as tightly tied to “must have two Approves recorded” as in the ground truth, but the meaning is correct. No deduction here.
- Slight loss: The answer omits explicitly spelling out that the “Sustainability Officer” is one of the three—though that’s implied.

**b) Required documents**

- **Errors:**
    - The LLM fails to list **“Signed Offer Sheet 77”** as a distinct, required document; this is present (step 8, per prompt, and in ground truth).
    - The LLM includes “ID Matrix Declaration” (good), but omits mention that both “Signed Offer Sheet 77” **and** “ID Matrix Declaration” are required in step 8.
- The rest of the document list is strictly correct and in order.
- The answer does NOT hallucinate any documents, which is good.

**Score rationale:**  
- The omission of “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is a clear factual error, because the ground truth and prompt specify this is a distinct document requirement. This is a non-trivial document omission.
- All other aspects (decision points and ordering for documents present) are correct.
- Under “utmost strictness,” even minor errors warrant significant deduction. The document omission is enough to lose 2 points (dropping it to 8), plus the LLM does not explicitly enumerate both docs required in step 8 (small deduction), and does not restate “Sustainability Officer” is one of the three (minimally relevant, but adds up).

**Final: 7.0**  
- Good fidelity for process logic;  
- Omission of required document (“Signed Offer Sheet 77”) is a notable accuracy issue;
- Slight looseness of expression (for full strictness) warrants further deduction.
