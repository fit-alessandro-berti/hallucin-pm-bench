**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies **Request_Documents** (#1 worst: highest wait 150 min, rework 22%) and **Review_Documents** (#2 worst: longest processing 25 min, high SLA 12.4%) with mostly accurate data-tied explanations. Actions are concrete/data-driven. Structure mimics memo format; ≤200 words. No hallucinations or absent activities.
- **Critical Failures (major deductions)**:
  - **Wrong #3 activity**: **Notify_Customer** is *not* under-performing (best metrics: wait 1 min, processing 2 min, rework/SLA 0%). Explanation fabricates "lag/backlog" via invalid upstream comparison—violates "based *strictly* on the table" (its own metrics excel; throughput drop is cumulative, not its fault). Ground truth correctly picks **Initial_Assessment** (wait 18 min, processing 12 min, SLA 3.2%).
  - Misses holistic issues like **Initial_Assessment**'s role in "feeding congestion" or throughput drops (e.g., Request_Documents at 190/day).
  - Note on Initial_Assessment undermines focus; implies ambiguity where data differentiates clearly (high waits/rework/SLA pinpoint top 3).
  - Lacks ground truth's precision (e.g., bolded metrics, throughput drops, projections); explanations less data-dense.
- **Overall**: ~67% alignment (2/3 correct), but misidentification of a "worst" activity is a *core* task failure—equivalent to guessing on unclear data (prompt forbids). Strict penalty: -5.8 points from 10.0.
