7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong on the documents section (perfect match to the ground truth's list of 7 items, including the conditional note for AuditTrail, with no introductions of extras—full points here). However, it underperforms significantly on decision points due to strict criteria: it identifies only 2 instead of the ground truth's 3, missing the explicit "final payment approval" at Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review (a key inferred gate for approval/rejection outcomes). The first decision point is partially accurate but hedges on ineligible outcomes (not asserting rejection as in ground truth), and formatting lacks the table structure while using prose summaries—minor but deductable under strictness for completeness and precision. This results in ~70% overall alignment, penalized heavily for the omission and descriptive gaps.
