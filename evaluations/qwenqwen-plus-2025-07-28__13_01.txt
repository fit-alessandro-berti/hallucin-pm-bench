10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth across all four questions. Question 1 is identical (1 occurrence). Question 2 matches precisely in value and calculation (5.56%). Question 3 correctly identifies the sole case (A1002), fulfilling the "list the case identifier(s)" requirement without extraneous wording. Question 4 provides two clear, accurate sampling-related reasons ("small sample size" and "temporal bias") that align directly with the ground truth options, including relevant explanations derived solely from the log data. No deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences are present.
