The LLM correctly answers "No" and identifies both C002 and C004 as the relevant exceptions, accurately citing the sequences in which other activities ("Pack_Items" in C002 and "Check_Fraud" in C004) intervene between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment". It also provides timestamps to support its claim.

Loss of points (2.0 points deducted) results from the following shortcomings in strict comparison with the ground truth:
- The LLM does not systematically analyze all cases (C001 and C003 are omitted in its justification), missing the explicit confirmation that in these cases, "Validate_Payment" does immediately follow "Receive_Order."
- The LLM does not quantify or summarize that 2 out of 4 cases violate the rule, nor does it make as explicit a connection to the "always" wording in the fact as the ground truth.
- Its justification, while correct for the exceptions, lacks the tabular clarity, completeness, and detail of the ground truth response.

These omissions represent a significant but not critical reduction in completeness and precision.
