The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides accurate justification by citing the two relevant counterexample cases (C002 and C004) with precise activity sequences and timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim. This fulfills the task requirements without factual errors. However, under utmost strictness, it loses 1.0 point for lacking the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case analysis (omitting explicit verification of compliant cases C001 and C003), which provides fuller evidence despite not being strictly necessary for disproof.
