8.0

The LLM answer is largely accurate and clearly structured. It uses the exact activity names from the process and lists all the required documents using correct, process-specific terminology. It also does not introduce standard loan terminology, as instructed.

**Minor errors/differences** leading to point deductions:

- For the "Final Micro-loan Board Approval" decision point, the LLM answer says: “If the board votes ‘approve,’ disburse funds (Step 9). If the board votes ‘reject,’ the process ends.” The ground truth only lists that the board votes Approve or Reject—while the LLM’s expansion is reasonable, the ground truth does not specify the outcome explicitly, so this is very minor but does go a tiny bit beyond the prompt.
- The LLM answer slightly condenses/combines wording in the “decision points” (e.g., uses “move on to Neighbourhood Feedback Check” vs the ground truth’s emphasis that the Underwriter Alignment Gate is “after the Dual Underwriter Split”). This is a subtle difference: the sequence is clear, but the LLM could be even stricter in tracing the exact flow and placement.
- For required documents, all are present and their names are correct, but the LLM answer could have also followed the “1...2...3...” bullet structure of the ground truth (minor, but explicit instructions on listing style were not given, so only a slight penalty).

**No major mistakes:** All step names and document names are correct, no extra documents or terminology introduced, all essential decision points are present.

Overall, the answer is highly faithful to the process, with only very small phrasing and sequencing strictness differences—thus, 8.0.
