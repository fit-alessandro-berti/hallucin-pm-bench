### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and comprehensive, closely aligning with the ground truth in identifying and describing the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) using exact terminology from the prompt. It correctly summarizes the branching logic without introducing extraneous loan terms. The required documents list is complete and verbatim from the prompt, with no omissions or additions.

**Strengths (minimal deviations):**
- All decision points are covered with precise conditions (e.g., score difference ≤2, amount thresholds, board vote outcomes).
- Documents match exactly in content, including specifics like form codes and descriptors (e.g., "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)").

**Weaknesses (small errors leading to point deduction):**
- Structure: LLM uses step numbers (e.g., "Step 5") and an introductory sentence, which are not in the ground truth; it also bullets documents instead of numbering them (0.3-point loss for unnecessary additions and formatting mismatch).
- Phrasing variances: For Amount Threshold, LLM omits explicit "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" positioning (ground truth includes flow context); for MBA, LLM adds interpretive outcomes ("disburse funds" or "process ends") beyond the ground truth's neutral "votes Approve or Reject" (0.3-point loss).
- Document wording: Minor inconsistencies like "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. ground truth's "pay-stub/tax slip" (omits "single" and uses slash); " (≤ 3 months old)" vs. " (≤ 3 months)" for Proof of Address; includes "template" for CIS, which ground truth shortens to "(CIS)" (0.2-point loss for not matching ground truth phrasing exactly).
- Omissions: Lacks ground truth's flow-position descriptors (e.g., "branch after Dual Underwriter Split") and the explanatory note about excluded standard documents, which reinforces the non-standard process (no major content gap, but strict adherence to ground truth style deducts 0.0 additional as it's not core).

Overall, differences are cosmetic and do not alter meaning, but per strict criteria, they warrant a deduction from a perfect 10.0.
