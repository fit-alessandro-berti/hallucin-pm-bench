### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall, closely aligning with the ground truth in structure, accuracy, and completeness for part (a), with only minor phrasing differences (e.g., LLM's interpretive "despite" clause and step-specific labeling add slight verbosity but do not alter the core rule summaries; the ground truth is more concise but semantically equivalent). However, part (b) has a clear and significant error under strict evaluation: the LLM incorrectly treats "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a non-unique variant of "Offer Sheet 77," resulting in an 8-item list instead of the ground truth's 9-item list, omitting a distinctly mentioned document from Step 8. This duplication avoidance, while reasoned, deviates from the ground truth's explicit separation and first-appearance ordering, warranting a meaningful deduction despite the otherwise precise sequencing of the remaining documents. No hallucinations (e.g., KYC/AML mentions) occur, supporting the high base score, but the strictness criterion penalizes even this targeted inaccuracy.
