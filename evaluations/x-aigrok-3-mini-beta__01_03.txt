8.2

a) **Decision Points:**  
- The LLM answer correctly identifies both decision points: the conditional branch after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check and the TriVote approval gate.  
- The wording and logic in both sentences are accurate and aligned with the process.  
- There is very minor, extraneous explanation in the TriVote point (“despite the process requiring approvals from all three to be sought”), which is slightly redundant but not incorrect; the word “sought” may confuse strict readers, since only two are needed to approve, but all three participate. This is a negligible imprecision, but relevant under strict grading.

b) **Documents:**  
- The LLM begins with Form 14B and correctly lists Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) and the Deck Memo.  
- It then lists Offer Sheet 77 (step 7) and ID Matrix Declaration (step 8), and Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9).  
- **Key error:** The answer omits “Signed Offer Sheet 77” as a separate required document. The ground truth treats “Signed Offer Sheet 77” (i.e., applicant confirmation) as distinct from “Offer Sheet 77” (i.e., the offer prepared by the bank), because in process step 8 both “Signed Offer Sheet 77” and “ID Matrix Declaration” are explicitly required from the applicant.  
- The LLM tries to justify this omission (“it is treated as a variant... so it is not listed as a separate document”), but per the prompt's demand for “all documents... in the order they first appear,” this is a clear divergence from instructions and the ground truth.

**No hallucinations** or spurious document mentions are present, and all other points are correctly ordered.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is strong on the logic and sequencing, but loses significant points due to the exclusion of “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” which was explicitly required by the prompt and present in the ground truth. There is also a minor phrasing imprecision in the description of the TriVote gate. Therefore, under strict criteria, a score of 8.2 reflects the (otherwise excellent) content marred by the (important) document omission.
