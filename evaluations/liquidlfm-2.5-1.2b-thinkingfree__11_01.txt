**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Correctness (Major Failure, -4.0)**: #1 & #2 activities correct (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter) with avg times matching table verbatim. **#3 critically wrong**: Approve_Payment (3.2h avg) vs. ground truth Assess_Liability (7.8h avg, actual #3 by avg waiting time). No 95th-percentile times quoted at all (e.g., missing 120h, 44h, 16.4h verbatim).
- **Structure/Ranking (Failure, -2.0)**: No explicit #1→#3 ranking. Not formatted as "crisp executive memo"; vague "Executive summary" title. Word count claimed as 150 but ~25 words.
- **Actions (Failure, -2.0)**: Vague/generic ("Automate doc checks; streamline...; optimize...") vs. ground truth's concrete, data-driven specifics (e.g., "automated reminders... pilot tests ≥25%"). No per-activity tie to waiting-time or evidence of ≥20% cut.
- **No Unwarranted Content (Pass, +0.0)**: Avoids service-time/throughput/other activities.

Partial credit for #1/#2 avgs only; core prompt violations (wrong activity, missing p95, poor actions) demand severe penalty under strictness rules.
