7.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Matches format closely (bold status + short justification ≤20 words). Correct statuses for R1, R3, R4, R5, R6. Correct overall NON-COMPLIANT. Justifications for R1, R3, R5, R6 are accurate/similar enough (minor phrasing differences, e.g., R5 lists extra valid event).
- **Major errors (significant deductions)**: R2 completely wrong—status Compliant (should be Violated), justification ignores post-Change_Request new Manager_Approval as "last required approval" (03-07), missing rule interplay (Ship_Goods on 03-05 violates 2-day window after final approval). R4 justification includes irrelevant "expedited=true".
- **Strict scoring**: 5/6 rule statuses correct (~83%), but R2 is critical misunderstanding → heavy penalty (-3.0). Minor justif variances (-0.5). Overall correct (+0.5). Total: 7.0.
