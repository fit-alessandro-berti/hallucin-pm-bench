The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely for questions 1-3, with exact counts, calculations, and case identification (minor formatting differences like bolding or escaping are negligible as they do not alter factual accuracy). For question 4, both reasons provided are directly aligned with two of the ground truth's examples ("small sample size" and "temporal bias"), stated clearly and without any inference beyond the log data. No hallucinations, deviations, or unsubstantiated assumptions are present.
