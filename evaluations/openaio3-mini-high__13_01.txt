9.7

**Justification:**

1. The answer to question 1 is **perfectly correct** ("Manual_Fraud_Check occurs exactly 1 time.").
2. The answer to question 2 is **correct, with a clearly shown calculation and precise rounding** ("1/18 × 100 ≈ 5.56%").
3. The answer to question 3 is **precisely correct** ("Only case A1002 contains Manual_Fraud_Check.").
4. For question 4, the answer gives:
   - (a) That the fragment covers only a very short time period ("all events are from May 1"), which covers *temporal bias*.
   - (b) The sample size is extremely small (only 18 events, 1 fraud check), which covers *small sample size/high variance*.
   
   Both provided reasons are *fully valid*, clear, and stated in justifiable terms, in direct alignment with the ideal answers.

**Minor deduction (0.3):**
- The wording of one phrase in point (a) for question 4 says "all events are from May 1", which—while accurate—does not explicitly mention "morning", but the time range is all on one date, so this is negligible.
- The ground truth lists multiple possible sources of bias for point 4, and the LLM gives two from that list. The answer is concise and free of hallucination, though the grounding could be slightly more explicit about *possible unrepresentativeness over a whole month*.

**No other issues observed.**

**Final Score:** 9.7
