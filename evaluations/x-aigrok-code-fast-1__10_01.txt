5.0

**Evaluation:**

**Positive points:**
- The LLM answer *strictly* followed the required vocabulary policy, using “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance”, and avoided the forbidden terms entirely.
- No extra or spurious activities or roles were introduced. The RACI matrix structure is clear and well-formatted.

**Major errors (with significant point deductions):**
- **RACI Role Assignments:** The matrix incorrectly assigns “A” (Accountable) to the Account Manager for *every* activity, regardless of process logic or the role descriptions in the ground truth. For several activities (like KYC Review or Payment Clearance), the “R” (Responsible) designation is given to the wrong role, ignoring the narrative and ground truth. For example:
    - “KYC Review” should have the Compliance Officer as Responsible, not the Account Manager.
    - “Order Vetting” should have Account Manager as Responsible/Accountable, but the LLM gives only Accountable without clarification.
    - There is a general failure to use C (Consulted) and I (Informed) except in “Record Update,” which is given only an “R” for IT, missing the correct Consulted/Informed designations.
- **Omission of Multiple Role Types:** The ground truth often has multiple letters for a role (e.g., “R/A” for Account Manager in “Receive Application”), and the LLM answer omits these dual-status entries entirely, simplifying to only one letter per cell or per role.
- **Consulted/Informed:** The LLM answer never assigns C or I to any cell, missing all nuances and flows of information in the ground truth.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer strictly follows vocabulary and layout constraints, which saves it from a catastrophic score. However, it performs very poorly on the actual RACI allocations, omitting nearly all Consulted and Informed statuses, assigning Accountable to the Account Manager for every row (even when not appropriate), and failing to note when a role is both Responsible and Accountable. Given the centrality of these errors to the process map, a substantial deduction is warranted, resulting in a 5.0.
