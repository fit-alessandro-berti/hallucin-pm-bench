The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without forbidden terms and maintains the exact activities and roles/columns without additions. However, the RACI assignments deviate significantly from the ground truth: it omits all "C" (Consulted) and "I" (Informed) designations across every row, incorrectly assigns "A" (Accountable) to Account Manager in "Record Update" (should be "C"), simplifies "R/A" combinations to lone "A" where needed (e.g., "Receive Application", "Order Vetting", "Notify Customer"), and leaves most cells blank instead of filling with appropriate "C" or "I". These omissions and errors fail to fully reflect the process narrative's implied role interactions, resulting in an incomplete and partially inaccurate matrix under strict evaluation criteria.
