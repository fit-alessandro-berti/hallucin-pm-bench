The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in substance, structure (one short paragraph explaining impossibility), and precision: both correctly identify the redacted event log (Artefact A) as lacking rows and timestamps (start_time/complete_time), explicitly preventing computation of cycle time, std. dev., and CI for “Approve Invoice”. Minor deductions for: (1) LLM's extra (accurate but unneeded) dismissal of Artefact B, absent in ground truth; (2) slight wording variances ("no observable data" vs. "necessary data are absent"; "for any cases" vs. "for any “Approve Invoice” execution"; lists metrics explicitly vs. "dispersion or confidence interval"); (3) omission of ground truth's closing "Additional raw log entries are required." No factual errors, no guessing, fully compliant with task.
