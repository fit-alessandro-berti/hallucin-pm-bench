1.0

The provided LLM answer is severely incomplete and non-functional as a BPMN 2.0 XML document. It consists only of a partial XML declaration and an opening <definitions> tag with incomplete namespace attributes, cutting off mid-sentence. This fails to produce any of the required elements specified in the prompt, including:

- No <bpmn:process> element.
- No start event (e.g., "wrc_start").
- No tasks (e.g., "Validate the claim", "Request missing information", etc., with verbatim names).
- No gateways (exclusive for completeness and warranty checks; parallel split/join).
- No sequence flows connecting elements.
- No end events (two required: one for rejection, one for success).
- Incorrect namespace handling (missing bpmn: prefix, incomplete xmlns:bpmndi).
- IDs do not follow the "wrc_" prefix.
- The document is not self-contained or valid XML (unclosed tags, abrupt truncation).

This omits ~95% of the ground truth structure (34 lines vs. ~5 partial lines), rendering it semantically equivalent to zero compliance. Under strict evaluation, even minor omissions warrant significant deductions; total failure justifies the minimum score.
