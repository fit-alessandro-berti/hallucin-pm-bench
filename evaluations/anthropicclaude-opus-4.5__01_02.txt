**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth)
- **Strengths (high alignment, preserving ~85% exact match):**
  - Correctly identifies exactly **3 decision points** with precise names: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
  - Conditions and outcomes match closely (e.g., ≤2 points difference/escalate; <€15 000 auto-approve vs. ≥ to MBA; board approve/reject).
  - Lists **all 6 required documents** exactly, using prompt terminology (e.g., includes "(CIS) template" faithful to prompt; Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet, NFF).
  - No introduction of forbidden standard loan terms; sticks to given activity names.

- **Errors/Differences (significant deductions for format, extras, rephrasing, notation – per strictness rule):**
  - **Format/structure (-0.8):** Elaborate markdown (## headings, ### subheads, table, --- separators, "Total: 6") vs. ground truth's simple "####", numbered lists, no extras. Table alters presentation significantly.
  - **Extra phrasing/content (-0.6):** "three key decision points", "(after Step 4)", "(Step 7)", "**Condition:**", "Evaluate the loan amount requested", "on applications ≥ €15,000", "→ proceed to Disburse Funds" (not in ground truth), "All documents must be submitted at application time" ("application" vs. prompt/ground "submission"), "accepted" in Income Statement note.
  - **Rephrasing/wording (-0.3):** E.g., "Compare risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" vs. ground's concise "*If Senior... scores differ...*"; "Continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" specifies next step (accurate but extra vs. "⇒ continue"); "Must be ≤ 3 months old" adds "Must be".
  - **Notation (-0.1):** "€15,000" (US comma) vs. ground truth/prompt "€15 000" (EU space) – small but penalized heavily.
  - **Missing elements (-0.0):** No deduction; has no omissions (e.g., includes all details ground has, plus accurate extras).

Content is factually superior/faithful to source prompt in places (e.g., keeps "single pay-stub or tax slip", "template"), but strict difference-counting vs. ground truth caps at 8.2. Perfect match would be 10.0; these accumulate to ~18% deviation.
