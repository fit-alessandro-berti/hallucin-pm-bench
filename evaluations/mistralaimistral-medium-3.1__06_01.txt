The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can run in parallel, with proper alphabetical ordering within each pair and across the list. The content matches the ground truth perfectly. However, it includes an unrequested introductory sentence, lacks the explanatory rationale section present in the ground truth, and has minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., lack of alignment spaces in the second pair, making the dashes not line up as in the ground truth). These structural and stylistic deviations warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
