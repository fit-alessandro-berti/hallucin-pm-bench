8.0

The LLM answer is very close to correct and follows the instructions. The only substantive issue is minor formatting:

- In the pair "Procure_Materials â€” Schedule_Machines", the LLM left only a single space before and after the em dash, while the ground truth shows five spaces ("     ") on each side of the em dash for that pair, which aligns the pairs vertically.
- The ground truth also omits the introduction line ("Here are..."), while the LLM provides a sentence before the answer block.

Although these differences are minor, the prompt specifies "utmost strictness" and says even "small errors should reflect in significant loss of points." Thus, for failure to precisely match the spacing and to provide any introduction text, a deduction is warranted.

Final assessment: The LLM gave the two correct pairs and in the correct alphabetical order within and between pairs, but did not adhere with strict precision to the required output format. This significant but not catastrophic formatting error justifies a score of 8.0.
