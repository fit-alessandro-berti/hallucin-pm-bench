7.0

The LLM answer uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") and avoids forbidden terms, fulfilling the critical vocabulary constraint. No forbidden or bracketed variants are present.

Errors and issues reducing the score:

- **Incorrect RACI allocations**:
    - For "Receive Application," ground truth shows "R/A" for Account Manager but the LLM answer gives only "R" (should be "R/A") and marks every other role as "I" (ground truth has "C" for CO and "I" for FC and IT).  
    - "Order Vetting" for Account Manager is "R" but ground truth says "R/A."
    - "Order Vetting" for Compliance Officer is "C" in ground truth but present in LLM, although fine; for Finance Clerk it is "I" in both, correct.
    - "Payment Clearance" has "R" for Finance Clerk but gives "A" to Account Manager (ground truth), while LLM only marks FC as "R," CO and AM as "I," IT as "C." Not a direct match: IT is "I" in ground truth, not "C".
    - "Record Update": In ground truth, IT Support is "R," others are "C/I/C." The LLM answer gives "R" to IT, but all others as "I"—missing the ground truth "C" for AM and FC.
    - "Notify Customer": Ground truth has AM as "R/A," others as "I"; LLM provides only "R"—should combine.

- **A/Accountable/Responsible shorthand confusion**: Ground truth sometimes uses "R/A" when a single role is both Responsible and Accountable. The LLM seems to separate these roles or only mark as "R," leading to imprecision.

- **Occasional Consultation ("C") errors**: For instance, in "KYC Review," ground truth says FC is "C" but LLM marks only as "I."

- **Minor but frequent cumulative errors**: Several activities do not match ground truth precisely in role assignments. The degree of mismatch warrants a significant points deduction.

- **Unwarranted content**: None. No extra tasks, correct columns.

- **Explanation is provided but not requested (neutral).**

- **Formatting**: Table is clear.

Due to the above, which includes several substantial allocation mismatches and omission of precise "R/A" dual role notation, a strict grade is 7.0/10.
