### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exclusively, with no forbidden terms appearing. It also maintains the correct activities as rows, roles as columns, and exactly one Responsible (R) per row, avoiding extra tasks or roles. However, it introduces several significant errors in RACI allocations compared to the ground truth, violating the requirement for allocations to precisely reflect the narrative (e.g., Account Manager as Accountable where appropriate, and specific Consulted roles):

- **Receive Application**: Missing Accountable (A) for Account Manager; Compliance Officer incorrectly Informed (I) instead of Consulted (C). (-1.0)
- **KYC Review**: Finance Clerk incorrectly I instead of C. (-0.5)
- **Order Vetting**: Missing A for Account Manager. (-0.5)
- **Payment Clearance**: Account Manager incorrectly I instead of A; Compliance Officer incorrectly I instead of C; IT Support incorrectly C instead of I. (-1.5)
- **Record Update**: Account Manager and Finance Clerk incorrectly I instead of C. (-1.0)
- **Notify Customer**: Missing A for Account Manager. (-0.5)

Additional deductions for unwarranted content: The explanation section adds interpretive content not requested (prompt specifies only the matrix), and it contains inaccuracies (e.g., claiming others are "consulted or informed as necessary" for KYC Review despite no C assignments; misstating consultations for Payment Clearance). Minor formatting issues (e.g., abbreviated role headers vs. ground truth's full names; lack of bolding on key cells; no combined R/A notation) compound strictness penalties. Overall, while terminology and structure are solid (partial credit ~4.0 base), the multiple allocation mismatches across all but one row warrant a sharp deduction to 3.0.
