3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Headings**: Not exact match to required "• Added tasks" etc. (used ### headers instead). Significant format violation (-1.0).
- **Added tasks**: Identified correct IDs (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`) factually present in XML, but used only bare IDs instead of full names with IDs as in ground truth (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Violates "element names exactly" intent and matches ground truth poorly (-1.5).
- **Removed tasks**: Completely incorrect—listed "(none)" but `send_rma_label` ("Send RMA Label") is absent in v2 XML while present in v1. Major factual omission (-3.0).
- **Gateway type changes**: Factually correct (`gw_valid` from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway), minor phrasing/format diff vs. ground truth (-0.5).
- **Overall**: Incomplete (missed key change), format errors, partial matches only. Strict deduction yields 3.0 (got ~50% right but critical failures).
