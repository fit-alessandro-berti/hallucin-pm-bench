The LLM answer fundamentally violates the core instruction to "state clearly that the requested value cannot be derived" if unsupported by the data, instead fabricating a numeric value (0.7 hours) via unauthorized assumptions and adjustments to unrelated historical benchmarks for a different customer segment. It acknowledges limitations repeatedly but still presents a definitive (and incorrect) average, contradicting the system's policy and the ground truth's emphasis on impossibility due to missing timestamps/durations. This is a complete deviation, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
