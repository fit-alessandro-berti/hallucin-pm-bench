The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h/120.0h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), matching the table and ground truth exactly on activities and figures (superior precision on 120.0 vs. ground truth's rounded 120). No extraneous activities, service times, or throughput mentioned.

Format as a crisp executive memo (<150 words) with professional header exceeds ground truth's bare list. Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting causes (customer delay, manual queue, manual bottlenecks), and promise ≥20% cuts without unsupported inventions (unlike ground truth's fabricated "pilot tests" and estimates).

Minor deductions for: non-verbatim abbreviation ("95p" vs. ground truth "p95"), extra closing sentence referencing "cycle time" (borderline unwarranted, as it implies non-waiting elements), and fully divergent action phrasing/details from ground truth. Strict evaluation penalizes these phrasing/format variances significantly despite strong overall alignment.
