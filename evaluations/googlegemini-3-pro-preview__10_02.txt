4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") throughout. It produces a Markdown RACI table covering all informal steps (with logical mapping), includes a clear legend/key, and adheres to the overall task format without omissions of core process elements.
- **Major Differences and Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **Roles/Columns**: LLM uses only 3 roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting "Operations Manager" present in ground truth. This is a structural mismatch, as the ground truth expands roles to 4, implying an additional layer of accountability not captured.
  - **Tasks/Rows**: LLM splits step 5 into two separate tasks (Release Payment and Transmit SWIFT Message) and treats archiving as a 7th task, resulting in 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6. Task names also differ slightly (e.g., "Log Transfer Instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record"), introducing unnecessary granularity and deviation.
  - **RACI Assignments**: Widespread mismatches across nearly every cell, even where tasks align:
    - Logging (Task 1): TA is R/A (over-assigning accountability) vs. ground truth R; adds IT C (unmatched); misses OM A.
    - Screening (Task 2): Mostly aligns (TA R, RL A) but adds unmatching IT C and OM I.
    - KYC Review (Task 3): TA I vs. C; RL R/A vs. R (A shifted to OM); misses IT I.
    - High-Risk Approval (Task 4): TA C and RL R/A vs. C and R (A to OM); misses IT I.
    - Release (Task 5): TA R/A vs. R (A to OM); adds extra row for Transmit (TA I, IT R/A) not in ground truth, which combines into one task.
    - Archiving (Task 6/7): TA - vs. C; IT R/A vs. R (A to OM); aligns on RL I but overall incomplete.
  - **Additional Elements**: LLM adds a process header ("Cross-Border Payment Execution") and detailed RACI key, which are extras not in ground truth. Ground truth emphasizes strict mapping without additions, and notes "uses only enforced synonyms" – LLM complies but doesn't match the exact output style or completeness.
- **Strictness Applied**: Per instructions, even small variances (e.g., task splitting, minor name tweaks) compound with larger issues (missing role, assignment shifts) to warrant severe point loss. The answer is directionally correct but not faithful to the ground truth's structure, roles, and assignments, reducing fidelity by ~60%. A perfect match would score 10.0; this is a moderate but flawed attempt.
