The LLM answer correctly identifies that the calculation is impossible due to missing data, specifically pointing out the lack of start and completion times in the event log. However, it is less precise and thorough than the ground truth answer. The ground truth makes clear reference to Artefact A and explains explicitly that both all event rows and every timestamp have been redacted, and ties this clearly to the inability to calculate any metric, including stating that additional log entries would be required.

The LLM answer omits mention of additional required data and does not reference Artefact A directly, slightly reducing clarity and specificity. It is accurate but not as complete or explicit as the ground truth, and therefore deserves a significant point deduction.
