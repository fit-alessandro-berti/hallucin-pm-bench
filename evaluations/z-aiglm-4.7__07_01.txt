8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
**Factual Accuracy (full marks: 10/10)**: 
- Added tasks correctly identifies "Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code".
- Removed tasks correctly identifies "Send RMA Label".
- Gateway type changes correctly identifies `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`.
- No extraneous or incorrect items reported; adheres to only specified categories.

**Format & Structure Compliance (deduction: -1.0)**:
- Headings match the prompt's "exact headings" with "•" bullets precisely.
- Lists items factually but uses plain line breaks instead of GT's `*` bullets.

**Detail & Exactness (deduction: -1.0)**:
- Uses task **names** exactly from XML `name` attributes (correct), but omits **ids** (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`) that GT explicitly includes for precise identification—small but significant omission per strictness rule, as ids are key XML identifiers ("element names").
- Gateway phrasing accurate but includes unnecessary name "(Warranty Valid?)" (not in GT) and lacks "(v1)/(v2)" versioning or **bold**/backticks.

**Overall**: Core facts perfect and prompt-compliant, but presentation/details diverge from GT in ways that reduce precision (e.g., no ids), warranting deductions under "utmost strictness." No speculation or extras beyond minor. Equivalent to ~85% match.
