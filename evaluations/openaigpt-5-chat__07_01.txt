7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), with no additions, omissions, or speculation. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for format deviations from the ground truth: (1) tasks are listed as full XML snippets rather than concise "Name (id = `id`)" format, introducing unnecessary verbosity not aligned with "use the element names exactly as they appear" (interpreting this as ids/names, not raw tags); (2) gateway change includes XML tags (< >) and omits version specifiers "(v1)" and "(v2)", reducing precision; (3) bullet style uses "-" instead of "*", a minor but required consistency match. These differences, though small, warrant a 2.5-point deduction from 10.0.
