**3.0**

### Explanation of Score (Strict Evaluation)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly uses all 4 mandated terms *exactly* ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no leaks or synonyms. Markdown table structure is valid. Covers all 4 roles. Includes 6 activities (matching GT count), attempting to cover "every activity".
- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **RACI assignments mismatch extensively** (only ~7/24 cells approximate or match; e.g., Intake Vetting: Front "R" vs "**R, A**", Comp Analyst "I" vs "C", Treasury "-" vs "I"; KYC/AML: Comp "R" vs "**R, A**", Officer "A" vs "C"; Risk Scoring: Front "-" vs "C"; extras have multiple shifts like Officer "A" vs "**R, A**").
  - **Activity names for extras incorrect**: "Approval" ≠ "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Fund Release" ≠ "Release Funds" (violates "do not rename"; adds despite "do not add").
  - **No combined "R, A" format** (GT uses "**R, A**" for dual roles; LLM uses singles only, leading to incomplete assignments).
  - **Formatting/style diffs**: No cell bolding on primaries; "-" vs "–"; misaligned/padded columns; merged/incorrect involvement (e.g., Officer "A" blanket for Comp Analyst activities, ignoring narrative escalation nuance).
  - **Merging implied**: KYC/AML/Risk treated nearly identically by LLM, but GT differentiates.
- **Overall**: ~30% cell fidelity; violates "covering **every activity and role**" accurately. Strictness demands near-exact GT match for high score—many small/medium errors compound to low grade.
