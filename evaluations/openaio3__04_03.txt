The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses each rule with justifications that align closely with the ground truth in content and reasoning. Minor differences include phrasing (e.g., "before RA" vs. "before RA is completed"; "complete" vs. "finished"; implied "(and after VP)" vs. explicit) and format (prose vs. table), but no factual errors or omissions. Under utmost strictness, a small deduction is applied for stylistic mismatches to the ground truth structure.
