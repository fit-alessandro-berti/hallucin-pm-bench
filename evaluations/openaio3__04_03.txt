9.0

The LLM answer is concise and correct about compliance ("No"), and references each rule, noting that rule 3 is violated. It summarizes the reasoning clearly and distinguishes between satisfied and violated rules. However, compared to the ground truthâ€™s tabular format and slightly richer phrasing (notably spelling out that NA occurs **before** RA is completed and that NA must wait until both QE and RA are finished), the LLM's justification is less precise in wording for rule 3. There's also a minor lack of emphasis about "why" NA is too early ("must wait until both QE and RA are complete"), though it does essentially state this.

This small loss in detail and structure (e.g., missing a tabular layout, more explicit description for rule 3) warrants a notable but not major deduction. Thus, 9.0.
