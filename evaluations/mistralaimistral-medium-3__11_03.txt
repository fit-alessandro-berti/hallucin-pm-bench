7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (driving the score up)**: The LLM correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth's selection. Quantification of SLA excesses is precise (+300s for both Risk Review and Legal Approval; +60s for Credit Assessment) and grounded in the data (Avg_Throughput_Time vs. Target_SLA). Waiting times are accurately stated. Bullet points are used exclusively for recommendations, as required. No invented activities or metrics beyond data-supported inferences (e.g., cases per activity are from the table). The memo is concise (~120 words, close to ~150) and focuses only on memo text.
  
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: Structure lacks formal elements like "To/From/Subject" present in ground truth, making it less executive-memo-like. Activity order differs (Risk Review first vs. ground truth's Legal Approval first). Opening lacks ground truth's contextual analysis (e.g., total cases or subject line). Recommendations are concrete and data-driven (tied to waiting/throughput issues) but entirely diverge from ground truth's specifics (e.g., LLM's resource reallocation vs. ground truth's pre-checks/analyst addition), introducing unsubstantiated targets like "50% reduction" or "20s cut" (minor invention of metrics, violating "do NOT invent" strictly). Closing sentence is generic and omits ground truth's projected impact (e.g., 35% cycle time reduction). These mismatches in phrasing, recommendations, and polish result in notable divergence, warranting a deduction from a potential 9-10. Small errors (e.g., inconsistent bolding/emphasis, no total cases mention) compound the loss. Overall, core content aligns ~75%, but strict criteria penalize non-identical execution heavily.
