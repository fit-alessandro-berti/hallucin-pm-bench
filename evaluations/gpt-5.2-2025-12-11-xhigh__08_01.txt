The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" with an accurate, minimal firing sequence ⟨T1, T2, T5, T3⟩ that directly demonstrates T5 firing before T3, including precise markings and a brief, correct justification focused on p3=1 and p4=0 (inhibitor condition). It avoids errors and unnecessary extensions.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic/presentation differences vs. ground truth (e.g., less detailed markings format, no bolding/enumeration, shorter sequence omitting T4, no "must" claim or deeper proof about permanent disablement post-T3), despite ground truth containing an invalid T4 firing step (p3=0 prevents it). Under utmost strictness, these non-identical elements reduce perfection, but no factual errors or omissions of required content (possibility + sequence + brief justification).
