9.0

- **Q1 (A1)**: Answer is correct ("3" and correct case IDs shown in parentheses). No error.
- **Q2 (A2)**: Exact match to the ground truthâ€”activities and separator are perfect. No error.
- **Q3 (A3)**: The activities listed are correct and in the right order; however, the LLM answer does not use underscores (the ground truth is "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock"; LLM wrote "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock", which is correct). However, the activities are both written exactly as in the ground truth, so this should not cause a deduction.

##### Detail:
- All elements of the answers are fully correct, including formatting and ordering, and no information is missing or added. No typographic or representation errors (e.g., using underscores or spaces).
- Some might penalize the stylistic inclusion of parentheses in Q1 (C001, C002, C003) when only the number is asked, but as this isn't hallucinated information (merely a clarification) and isn't penalized by the rubric unless prohibited, it's a minor matter.

##### Strict grading note:
- Since the prompt asks for utmost strictness, the fact that for Q1, the LLM included the case IDs in parentheses, where the ground truth only answers the number, should incur a small penalty (as extra information not in ground truth). This is a **very minor deviation**, deserving a **1-point deduction**.

**Final strict score: 9.0**
