**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Part (a) - Decision Points (9.0/10):**  
Near-perfect match. Both decision points are correctly identified and summarized accurately in one sentence each. Minor deductions for slight wording variances (e.g., "combined risk rating" not explicitly in process; "skip Step 5" vs. GT's "bypass... otherwise proceeds"; "any two... approve it" vs. GT's "at least two... record 'Approve'") and added step references/formatting not in GT. These are small but warrant point loss per strictness rule.

**Part (b) - Documents List (0.0/10):**  
Major failures:  
- Omits **4 critical documents** entirely: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow (explicit "Inputs" in Step 3, first appearance order, required for Tri-Color-Risk-Check).  
- Fails to distinguish **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (Step 8, listed separately in GT as distinct from unsigned Offer Sheet 77 in Step 7); LLM lists only unsigned version once.  
- Results in incomplete list (5 items vs. GT's 9), wrong order due to omissions, and misses ~44% of required items.  
No hallucinations (good), but incompleteness/omissions are severe errors, not "small."

**Overall:** Equal weighting of parts → (9.0 + 0.0)/2 = 4.5, rounded down to **4.0** for strictness on b)'s factual inaccuracies and GT divergence.
