4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Status and justification match closely (minimal wording difference). No deduction.
- **R2**: Status matches (Violated), but justification is inaccurate—misstates timeline (March 4 to 5 is ~1 day, not 3) and ignores change's impact on "last required approval" per ground truth (should reference March 7 approval). Significant error: -2.0 points.
- **R3**: Status and justification match exactly. No deduction.
- **R4**: Status and justification match. No deduction.
- **R5**: Status mismatches (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice precede new Manager_Approval, violating "before any further processing step." Major error: -4.0 points.
- **R6**: Status and justification match. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Status matches (NON-COMPLIANT), but listed violations incomplete (omits R5; ground truth includes R2, R3, R5). Partial error: -1.0 point.
- **Format/Conciseness**: Follows prompt (per-rule status + ≤20-word justification, all-caps overall). Minor deduction for bolding inconsistencies vs. ground truth table (-0.5, but strictness applied).
- **Total**: Starting from 10.0, deductions yield 4.0. Strict assessment penalizes factual inaccuracies and rule misinterpretation heavily, as they alter compliance analysis.
