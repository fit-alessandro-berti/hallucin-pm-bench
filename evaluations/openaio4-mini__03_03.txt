5.5

**Evaluation (strict):**

**1. Names on Elements:**
- **Start Event:**  
  - LLM: `<bpmn2:startEvent id="wrc_StartEvent"/>` (No `name` attribute, should be `"Online warranty claim submitted"` per ground truth.)
  - -1.0

- **End Events:**  
  - LLM: `<bpmn2:endEvent id="wrc_EndEvent_Rejection"/>` and `<bpmn2:endEvent id="wrc_EndEvent_Success"/>` (No `name` attribute, should be `"Rejected"` and `"Successful end"`.)
  - -0.5

- **Task Names:**  
  - LLM preserves most task names ("Create shipment order", "Schedule courier pickup", etc.), **but** some are not verbatim to the prompt:
    - `"validates the claim"` ≠ `"Validate the claim"` (-0.5)
    - `"requests missing information"` ≠ `"Request missing information"` (-0.5)
    - `"checks warranty eligibility"` ≠ `"Check warranty eligibility"` ("Check" vs "checks") (-0.25)
    - `"send rejection notice"` ("send" vs "Send") (-0.25)
    - `"update inventory records"` ("update" vs "Update") (-0.25)
    - `"close the claim"` ("close" vs "Close") (-0.25)

- **Gateway Names:**  
  - **LLM omits all gateway names.** The ground truth provides `"Claim complete?"`, `"Within warranty?"`.
  - -1.0

**2. BPMN tag namespace:**
- LLM uses `bpmn2` prefix, while ground truth is `bpmn`. This is acceptable if consistent and the document is otherwise correct. **No deduction.**

**3. Sequence Flows:**  
- All flows present and correct. Flows for requesting info, eligibility/rejection, and parallel split/merge present.  
- **However, the semantic labelling ("Yes"/"No" on sequenceFlow's name) is missing.** (Ground truth uses `name="Yes"`/`"No"`.)  
  - -0.5

**4. IDs:**  
- All element IDs are correctly prefixed with `wrc_` as required.  
- **Partial credit** since, e.g., is not exactly the same naming as ground truth, but the prefix is honored as per prompt.

**5. Control Flow / Structure:**
- **Parallel gateways for split/join:** present and correct.
- **Exclusive gateways for completeness & warranty:** present and correct.
- **Both end events as instructed:** present.

**6. Extra/Hallucinated elements:**  
- No hallucinated steps or elements present.  
- **Correct**.

**7. Other:**
- **Process id:** Different, but prefix is correct as per prompt. Acceptable.
- **Process `isExecutable` attribute:** LLM uses `isExecutable="true"`, ground truth uses `"false"`—not mentioned in prompt, no deduction.
- **Total lines and compactness:** Not a criteria for correctness.

**Summary table of strict deductions:**  
| Item                        | Deduction |
|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Start/end event names       | -1.5      |
| Task name verbatim errors   | -2.0      |
| Gateway name omission       | -1.0      |
| SequenceFlow "Yes"/"No"     | -0.5      |
|                             | **-5.0**  |

**Starting from 10.0, total after deductions: 5.0.**

**However**, as the major structure is correct and all flows, gateways, and elements are present (with only naming issues and missing labels), I grant a slight rounding up for providing all required constructs and no hallucinated steps: **5.5** is the fair and strict score.
