**9.5**

The LLM answer identifies exactly the correct two pairs from Process B (ignoring Process A as instructed), sorts them correctly alphabetically both within pairs (Create_Documentation before Quality_Check; Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines) and overall (C-pair before P-pair), and uses the per-line pair format. 

Minor deductions (-0.5) for whitespace/format deviations from ground truth:
- Lacks precise alignment of "—" across lines (e.g., ground truth uses 2 spaces before/after "—" consistently, with padding on second line for vertical alignment).
- Uses single spaces around "—" instead of matching the example's apparent double spaces.
- Possible trailing spaces on first line.

Content and logic are perfect; only cosmetic string differences prevent 10.0 under utmost strictness.
