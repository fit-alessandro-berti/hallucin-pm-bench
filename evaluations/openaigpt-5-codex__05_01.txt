The LLM answer correctly identifies the need for an interrupting boundary timer event to auto-escalate to Task_Triage, aligning with the SLA goal without new tasks. However, it scores low due to critical flaws: (1) attaching the timer to Task_RequestDocs (instead of Task_Receive) fails to monitor from submission, missing delays in early steps like Receive/Checkâ€”violating the 48-hour rule comprehensively; (2) using timeDate with a variable is overly complex and imprecise vs. ground truth's simple timeDuration PT48H; (3) reusing f6 for the timer flow is illogical and unclear, unlike the direct new sequenceFlow; (4) explanation narrows to "awaiting documents," ignoring broader delays. These errors significantly undermine effectiveness, warranting major deductions despite the core idea.
