**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict line-by-line factual precision):
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth ("3"). Perfect (10/10 contribution).
- **Q2**: Exact sequence match ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"), ignoring ground truth's markdown escaping of underscores (which is representational, not content difference; prompt uses unescaped names). Perfect (10/10 contribution).
- **Q3**: Major failures (0/10 contribution):
  - Missing "Arrange_Delivery" (critical omission; it immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in C002).
  - Fabricated/hallucinated "Ship_Order" (no case has "Ship_Order" immediately preceding another "Ship_Order").
  - Only "Check_Stock" is correct (precedes in C001/C003), but list incomplete/extra.
  - Not alphabetically ordered ("Arrange_Delivery" before "Check_Stock" required; LLM has "Check_Stock" → "Ship_Order").
  - Format close ("one per line"), but content errors dominate.

**Overall**: 2/3 questions perfect, but Q3 has multiple hallucinations/omissions + order error = significant penalty per strict criteria (unweighted average ~6.7, rounded down to 6.0 for utmost strictness on errors).
