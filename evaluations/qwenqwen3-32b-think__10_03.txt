2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) exactly as specified without synonyms or leaks. However, it introduces unauthorized activity names (e.g., "Payment Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release") that rename or add beyond the narrative's described activities, violating the "do not rename, merge, or add activities" rule. This is a major infraction, deducting heavily.
  
- **Activity Coverage (Major Errors)**: The ground truth identifies six precise activities derived strictly from the narrative (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring, Compliance Officer Approval, Release Funds). The LLM invents seven activities, incorrectly splitting/merging/escalating elements (e.g., "Payment Approval" instead of "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Payment Scheduling" and "Fund Release" as separate from "Release Funds"). This adds extraneous content and fails to cover "every activity... described above" accurately, leading to significant deviation.

- **RACI Assignments (Numerous Mismatches)**: 
  - Intake Vetting: LLM assigns Front-Office Analyst (R, A), Compliance Analyst (C, I); misses Treasury Ops (I). Ground truth: Front-Office (R, A), Compliance (C), Treasury (I). Error in extra "I" and missing role.
  - KYC Review: LLM assigns Compliance Analyst (R, A), Compliance Officer (C); misses Treasury (I). Ground truth includes Treasury (I). Incomplete.
  - AML Screening: LLM assigns Compliance Analyst (R, A), Compliance Officer (C), Treasury (I with "*"); close but format obscures, and "*" note adds unauthorized explanation.
  - Risk Scoring: LLM assigns Compliance Analyst (R), Compliance Officer (A), Treasury (I); misses Front-Office Analyst (C). Incomplete.
  - Added/Renamed Activities: LLM's "Payment Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release" have assignments (e.g., Compliance Officer R/A for Approval, Treasury R/A for others) that loosely approximate ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" (Officer R/A, others I/C) and "Release Funds" (Treasury R/A, others I/C), but wrong names and extra "Scheduling" split deduct points. No match for ground truth structure.
  - Overall, ~40-50% of assignments mismatch or are absent/extra due to added activities and omissions.

- **Format and Structure (Critical Failure)**: Ground truth uses a clean Markdown table with combined "R, A" in single cells per role, dashes (â€“) for no involvement, and a compact, readable layout. LLM's table is malformed (multi-row sprawl per activity, inconsistent dashes, "*" markers), unreadable, and non-standard for RACI matrices. It includes unauthorized "Notes" section with explanations (e.g., escalation rules, "*"), violating "Return the matrix as a Markdown table" and adding interpretive content. This alone warrants severe deduction for strictness.

- **Strictness Applied**: Even minor issues (e.g., missing "I" in some rows, extra "Informed" for Compliance in Intake) compound with major ones (added activities, poor format). The output is ~60% divergent from ground truth in content and structure, justifying a low score. Partial credit only for vocabulary adherence prevents a 1.0.
