5.0

The answer demonstrates some awareness of the vocabulary policy and process intent, but contains numerous significant errors and deviations from the ground truth, including table structure, unauthorized activity renaming/addition, notation mistakes, and role misassignments. Detailed evaluation below:

**Strengths:**
- Uses only the authorized vocabulary for the four mandated terms (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) in the activity list.
- Does not leak any prohibited synonyms (no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", "Sanctions Check", or "risk rating" appear).
- Attempts to align RACI values with role responsibilities.

**Major Errors Causing Point Deductions:**

1. **Unauthorized Activities Added or Renamed**:
   - "Payment Approval," "Payment Scheduling," and "Fund Release" are not named in the ground truthâ€”these are synonyms or activity splits and violate the instruction not to add or rename activities ("Do not rename, merge, or add").
   - "Compliance Officer Approval" is missing by name; "Release Funds" is replaced with "Fund Release".
   - Every such unauthorized addition/renaming is a serious error per the prompt.

2. **RACI Notation and Formatting Errors**:
   - Instead of expressing joint R,A as in "R, A", the answer places "Responsible" and "Accountable" on separate lines, muddying clarity.
   - Sometimes multiple roles have the same RACI code for the same activity (e.g., both Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer marked as "Accountable" for Risk Scoring, which is inconsistent).
   - Use of dash/hyphen "-" is inconsistent with the ground truth (should mark no role; in the answer, sometimes used in a line, sometimes omitted).

3. **Role Assignments Deviation**:
   - In the ground truth, **Risk Scoring** is R (Compliance Analyst), A (Compliance Officer); the answer makes both Responsible and Accountable for different roles.
   - For **Intake Vetting**, ground truth is "R, A" (Front-Office Analyst); answer separates these lines and adds Consulted/Informed where not required.
   - The assignment of Consulted and Informed for nearly all activities does not match the ground truth (for example, Treasury Ops is over-informed in the answer).
   - Several roles are marked as Consulted or Informed in cases not supported by the process narrative.

4. **Table Structure Error**:
   - Use of multiple rows per activity to show R, A, C, I is non-standard and both less clear than the simple "R, A", "C", "I" summary style, and not what the prompt expects (e.g., the ground truth shows all designations in one cell).
   - The ground truth table is a compact form; this answer's breakup is a serious formatting mismatch.

5. **Explanatory Notes and Asterisks**:
   - Use of "\*" and explanatory text introduces complexity not present in the ground-truth.
   - Justifying assignment of Responsible/Accountable (e.g. "due to escalation rules") is unnecessary and not requested; per instructions, no extra parenthetical explanations.

**Summary**:
- The answer gets half the point for safeguarding vocabulary and broadly following process logic, but the unauthorized changes to activity names, incorrect role assignments, RACI notation/formatting errors, and extra content are significant and consistent with a strict loss of 5 full points.

**Final: 5.0/10.0**
