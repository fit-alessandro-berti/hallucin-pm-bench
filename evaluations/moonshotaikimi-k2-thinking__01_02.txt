7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Alignment (Strengths)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the three key decision points using exact activity names (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) without introducing standard loan terminology. Descriptions of each point's logic (e.g., score difference threshold, amount threshold, board vote) are substantively accurate. The required documents list all six items verbatim from the prompt, in the correct order, with no additions or omissions of items. Structure is clear and separated into sections. This provides a solid foundation, avoiding major factual errors.

- **Differences and Errors (Strict Deductions)**: 
  - **Decision Points ( -1.5 points total)**: 
    - Point 1 omits the ground truth's explicit positioning ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split") and specific underwriter names ("Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B"), using a more generic phrase ("the two independent risk scores"). This reduces precision in summarizing the process flow.
    - Point 2 omits the ground truth's positioning ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which is critical for contextual accuracy in the step-by-step process.
    - Point 3 uses lowercase "approve or reject" instead of the ground truth's emphasized "**Approve** or **Reject**", missing the exact terminology and formatting nuance.
  - **Required Documents ( -1.0 point total)**: 
    - Phrasing mismatches in three items: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" adds "old" (ground truth: "(≤ 3 months)"); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" adds "single" and uses "or" instead of "/" (ground truth: "(pay-stub/tax slip)"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds "template" (ground truth: "(CIS)"). These are small but violate exact matching.
    - Uses bullets instead of numbered list as in ground truth.
    - Omits the ground truth's header "Required documents (complete list)" and the closing note "*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*", which reinforces the prompt's emphasis on non-standard process and completeness.
  - **Format and Style ( -0.3 points)**: Lacks ground truth's "####" headers and italicized/emphasized elements (e.g., *If ... ⇒ continue*). Uses "---" separator and bold subheaders, which is functional but not identical.

- **Scoring Logic**: Starting from 10.0 for perfect match, deducted 2.8 points cumulatively for the above (0.5–1.0 per category of differences, scaled for "significant loss" on small errors like phrasing/omissions). The answer is highly functional and close (80%+ overlap), but strict evaluation penalizes all deviations from the ground truth's precise wording, structure, and inclusions, resulting in 7.2. No credit for extras or intent—only fidelity to ground truth.
