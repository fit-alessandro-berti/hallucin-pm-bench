3.0

The LLM correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant ("No"), aligning with the ground truth. However, its justifications are severely flawed and contradict the trace and rules in most cases, warranting a low score under strict evaluation:

- Rule 1: Incorrectly claimed as violated (it requires order, not direct succession; QE precedes RA once each, as in ground truth).
- Rule 2: Incorrectly claimed as violated (VP follows both QE and RA in the trace, satisfying the High severity requirement).
- Rule 3: Correctly identified as violated (NA before RA completion).
- Rule 4: Incorrectly claimed as violated (CC follows NA and VP).

Only one of four rule assessments is accurate, with the rest showing fundamental misreadings of the trace sequence, leading to major deviations from the ground truth's precise per-rule analysis.
