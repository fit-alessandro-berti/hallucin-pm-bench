**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match in substance to the ground truth across all questions, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log data, or factual errors. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., phrasing in Q1/Q3, LaTeX vs. inline calc in Q2, no space before % in Q2, bold formatting) do not constitute errors under the prompt's criteria, as the core content, calculations, listings, and reasons (small sample size and temporal bias, both explicitly allowed) align perfectly. Strict evaluation confirms zero deviations warranting point loss.
