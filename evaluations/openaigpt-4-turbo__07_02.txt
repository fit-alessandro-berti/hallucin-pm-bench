7.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correct core changes identified (major credit)**: Added tasks exactly match (3 correct: Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject). Removed tasks correct (1: Task_RejectLoan). Gateway-type change correct (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision).
- **Significant deductions for deviations**:
  - **Extra interpretive/speculative content (-1.0)**: "appears to have been replaced by 'Task_FinalReject'" in Removed tasks (not factual diff, interpretive); functional explanations (e.g., "added at the start", "handle cases where...", "allows multiple paths simultaneously, reflecting...") not in ground truth or prompt.
  - **Mentions of ignored cosmetics (-0.5)**: Gateway name change ("now named 'Eligibility Check'") explicitly ignores renamings.
  - **Format/structure mismatch (-0.5)**: Bullets vs. numbered lists; ID-first + prose descriptions vs. concise "Name (`ID`)"; descriptive phrases vs. exact names; no "(XOR)/(OR)" semantics; extra headings styling (### vs. * **).
  - **No extraneous changes added/omitted**: No credit loss here.
- **Strictness applied**: Extras and phrasing differences treated as substantive (not minimal summaries); perfect match would be 10.0. Ground truth is ultra-concise/pure-list; LLM adds ~50% fluff. No other errors (e.g., no wrong tasks listed).
