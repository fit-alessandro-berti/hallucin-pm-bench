The LLM answer is fully correct in terms of content: it clearly states that no calculations can be performed due to the absence of event data, explaining that all event rows and timestamp values have been redacted, which prevents cycle time metrics computation. 

However, there are small shortcomings in strict alignment and conciseness with respect to the ground truth:

- The answer could be slightly more concise (the ground truth answers with "Impossible â€” the necessary data are absent").
- The phrase "all rows and timestamp values have been redacted" is present, but not the explicit statement that additional raw log entries are required.
- While the LLM answer says "it is impossible to calculate these time-based metrics" (which is correct), the ground truth explains further that "neither the average cycle time nor its dispersion or confidence interval can be calculated," directly mapping the question structure.

Due to these small differences in brevity and the full echoing of the explicit request for additional data, I subtract 1 point.
