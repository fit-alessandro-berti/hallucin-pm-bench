1.5

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Activities**: Uses the 4 authorized terms correctly but *adds unauthorized activities* (Payment Scheduling, Funds Release, Notification) violating "do not ... add activities." Ground truth adds different ones (Compliance Officer Approval, Release Funds), but LLM's extras mismatch entirely (3 vs. 2, different names).
- **RACI assignments**: Almost no cells match exactly:
  | Activity | Matching cells? |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | FO partial (Responsible vs. **R, A**); others mismatch (empty ≠ C/–/I) |
  | KYC Review | CA partial (Responsible vs. **R, A**); others mismatch |
  | AML Screening | CA mismatch (Consulted ≠ **R, A**); TO partial (Informed ≈ I); others mismatch |
  | Risk Scoring | CO partial (Accountable ≈ **A**); all others mismatch (e.g., FO Responsible ≠ C; CA empty ≠ R) |
  | Extras | No overlap; completely divergent |
- **Formatting**: Full words ("Responsible") vs. abbreviations (**R, A**/C/I/–); blanks vs. explicit –/I; no bolding on activities or **R, A**; minor header differences.
- **Extra content**: Adds unrequested RACI definitions paragraph.
- **Vocabulary**: Correct (no leaks), a minor positive not offsetting errors.
- **Coverage**: Fails to accurately reflect narrative (e.g., Compliance Analyst performs AML Screening/Risk Scoring, not Front-Office Responsible or Consulted; ignores escalation logic properly).

Even partial matches are inexact; cumulative errors (additions, mismatches, extras) justify major deductions.
