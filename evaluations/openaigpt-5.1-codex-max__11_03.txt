**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (driving score up)**: Perfectly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) in same order, based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waits (600s, 480s, 200s)—core matches GT exactly. Quantifies excesses precisely. Uses bullets *only* for recommendations. Stays grounded in table data (no inventions like GT's "4805 cases," "€25k," "35% reduction," or "April 2025"). Concrete, data-driven recs (citing specific metrics/cases). Only memo text, ~140 words (≈150).
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences)**: Header differs (no "From," shorter To/Subject). Intro phrasing/structure mismatch (paragraph vs GT's bolded list). Includes case counts (465/480/1175) absent in GT's listings. Recs completely different content/ideas (LLM: queue reprioritization/triage/inflow smoothing vs GT: pre-checks/analyst/automation/heuristic)—major divergence in ~30% of content. No closing projection. Interpretive sentence ("prolonged waits... primary drivers") adds unmirrored phrasing. Small formatting gaps (no bolds) compound under strictness. 

Net: High substance (9/10), but stylistic/content diffs in header/listing/recs/close drop to 7.0.
