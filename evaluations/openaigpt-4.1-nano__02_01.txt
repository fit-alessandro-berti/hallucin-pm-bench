2.5

The LLM answer is almost perfect on Q1–Q4, but completely incorrect for Q5.

- Q1 ("distinct case IDs"): **Correct** (3)
- Q2 ("immediately precedes 'Ship_Order' in A-9321"): **Correct** ("Pack_Items")
- Q3 ("earliest timestamp"): **Correct** ("2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00")
- Q4 ("'Quality_Check' occurrences"): **Correct** (2)
- Q5 ("activities never as first event"): **Completely incorrect**  
  - The correct answer is ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"], i.e., these three activities never appear as the first event of any case in the fragment. However, the LLM answer gives ["Receive_Order"], which is in fact always first (for two out of three cases), so this is as wrong as it gets for this item.

**Deduction reasoning:**  
- Q1–Q4: 4/5 points.
- Q5: Major error, lose all credit for this (should deduct at least half the total), as it demonstrates a misunderstanding and misreading of the most involved requirement.

Thus, strict scoring with significant penalty on Q5 results in **2.5/10**. This reflects severe loss for a completely wrong answer in Q5, despite fully correct answers on Q1–Q4.
