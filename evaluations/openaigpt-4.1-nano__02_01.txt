5.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, but fails completely on Q5: it provides a single incorrect activity ("Receive_Order", which *does* appear as a first event) instead of the correct list of three activities that never start any case ("Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"). This is a major error in comprehension and analysis of the log, warranting significant deduction despite perfection elsewhere. Under strict evaluation, the overall accuracy is roughly 80% (4/5 questions correct), adjusted downward to 5.0 for the critical qualitative failure in Q5.
