**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Added tasks**: Fully correct (identifies all 3 new tasks by precise IDs: `Task_VerifyIdentity`, `Task_RequestDocs`, `Task_FinalReject`). Matches ground truth items exactly, despite format difference (IDs vs. name+ID). No deduction here.
- **Removed tasks**: **Major error** (-4.0+ impact). LLM incorrectly lists `Task_ApproveLoan` as removed (it exists in v2 with same ID, only name changed—explicitly ignore per prompt). Correctly identifies `Task_RejectLoan` as only true removal, but extra/wrong entry makes list inaccurate vs. ground truth (only 1 item).
- **Gateway-type changes**: Correct identification (`Gateway_Decision`: exclusive → inclusive). Matches prompt example format precisely; minor phrasing diff vs. ground truth (no "XOR/OR v1/v2" verbosity) is acceptable. No deduction.
- **Overall structure/compliance**: Uses exact headings. Ignores renamings/flows/XML order correctly. Unrequested Python code is extraneous but plaintext section aligns. No extras/misses beyond noted error.
- **Strictness adjustment**: Factual inaccuracy in "Removed tasks" (core category, wrong item listed) is significant—not small/cosmetic—warranting major deduction despite 2/3 categories perfect. Total reflects ~80% accuracy tainted by critical flaw.
