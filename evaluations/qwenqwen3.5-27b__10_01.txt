**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary policy (mandated, per notes)**: Perfect (10/10). Uses exact “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”; no forbidden terms. All three appear.
- **Structure & Format**: Poor (2/10). Correct table layout and full role names in headers, but:
  - Extra unwarranted title ("# FinCo...") and legend (not in GT; violates "no extra content").
  - No C (Consulted) in legend or usage (standard RACI requires it; GT uses it pervasively).
  - No bolding on key cells/headers (e.g., **R / A**, **KYC Review**).
  - "R, A" vs. GT's "**R / A**" or separate; empties where GT has entries.
- **RACI Content (core, per notes)**: Failing (1/10). Massive differences despite "reflect narrative" criterion:
  - No row fully matches GT (24 cells total; ~4 partially align on AM R/A equivalents, but all miss C/I or have extras/swaps).
  - Examples of strict errors:
    | Activity | Key Diffs (LLM vs GT) |
    |----------|-----------------------|
    | Receive Application | Misses CO=C, FC=I, IT=I |
    | KYC Review | AM=I (should be A); CO=R,A (extra A, should be R); misses FC=C, IT=I |
    | Order Vetting | Misses CO=C, FC=I, IT=I |
    | Payment Clearance | AM=I (should be A); FC=R,A (extra A); misses CO=C, IT=I |
    | Record Update | AM=I (should be C); IT=R,A (extra A); misses CO=I, FC=C |
    | Notify Customer | Misses CO=I, FC=I, IT=I |
  - Violates "exactly one Responsible" nuance (LLM adds unwarranted A to R); ignores GT's AM Accountable pattern and C/I fills.
  - Empties = ~60% mismatch; swaps (e.g., A/I flips) compound errors.
- **Overall**: Basic skeleton + terms salvage minimal score, but pervasive content/format diffs (small errors like missing I/C = major deductions) yield low grade. Unintuitive GT C/I density not matched.
