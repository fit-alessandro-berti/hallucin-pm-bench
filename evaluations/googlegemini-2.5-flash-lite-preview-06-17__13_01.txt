The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth across all questions, with no hallucinations or inferences beyond the log data. Q1-Q3 are exact matches in content and detail. For Q4, the two reasons provided are valid, clearly stated sampling concerns that directly correspond to "small sample size" and "temporal bias" from the ground truth examples (with the second reason incorporating elements of non-representativeness over time, such as limited days and business periods). Minor deductions for slightly broader phrasing in the second reason (e.g., "external factors" is implied but not explicitly tied to log absence) and not using the exact bullet-point terminology, per strict evaluation criteria.
