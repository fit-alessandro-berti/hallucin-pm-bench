### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall, accurately identifying the core decision points and listing all required documents without introducing extraneous elements, adhering to the prompt's constraints. It correctly pinpoints three decision points (eligibility validation, pre-approval, and the high-value threshold branch) and matches the ground truth's document list verbatim, including the conditional note on *AuditTrail*. However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for the following differences:

- **Decision point summarization (major deduction: -1.0)**: The LLM describes the decisions but omits explicit branching logic and outcomes (e.g., "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → claim rejected" from ground truth #1, or "Approved → payment; Rejected → ends" from #3). It treats activities like *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility* and *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* as decision points without the ground truth's precise naming (e.g., "*Eligibility check* during...") or combined "final payment approval" framing, reducing completeness.
- **Structure and detail (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Lacks the ground truth's tabular format for decisions, which clearly delineates branching logic, and does not include the final note reinforcing no legacy activities/documents—small omissions that affect clarity and fidelity.

This results in a high but not perfect score, as the content is substantively accurate yet less detailed and structured than the ground truth.
