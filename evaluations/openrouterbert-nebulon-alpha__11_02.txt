**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Review_Documents, Request_Documents, Initial_Assessment) as ground truth. Explanations cite table metrics accurately overall (e.g., Review_Documents' 25 min processing, 12.4% SLA, 30 min wait; Request_Documents' 150 min wait, 22% rework; Initial_Assessment's 18 min wait, 3.2% SLA). Recommendations are concrete, mostly data-driven (tied to wait/rework/variability), and one-per-activity (minor caveat below). Memo format is executive-style, concise (~150 words <200), no extraneous activities or hallucinations beyond noted issues.
- **Penalties (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Factual error (-1.5)**: Claims Review_Documents has "highest ... rework rate (5.3%)"—false; table shows Request_Documents at 22.0% (clearly highest). Violates "based strictly on the table"; small phrasing error but major precision loss per instructions.
  - **Order mismatch (-0.3)**: Ranks Review_Documents #1 (SLA-focused) vs. ground truth's logical throughput/wait/rework prioritization (Request_Documents #1). Numbers differentiate (e.g., Request_Documents' throughput drop to 190, unmatched wait/rework); not "unclear" per prompt.
  - **Recommendation issues (-0.2)**: Review_Documents rec lists *two* actions ("pre-review checklist; pilot 24-hour SLA") vs. prompt's "one concrete"; 24-hour SLA arbitrary/not data-driven (table in minutes, avg 25 min processing).
  - **Missing nuance (-0.0)**: No throughput drop emphasis (e.g., Request_Documents 190 vs. upstream 280) or projections, but not required.

Overall: Excellent alignment (90% match) but strict penalties for precision errors drop from 10.0.
