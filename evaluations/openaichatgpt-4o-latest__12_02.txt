The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a valid justification by citing the counterexample in case C003 (lines 6-7), where Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order, directly disproving the "always follows" claim. This aligns well with the ground truth's primary counterexample. However, it deducts points for incompleteness: it fails to mention the additional counterexample in case C005 (line 11), where Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order, which the ground truth explicitly highlights as another clear violation of the "always" condition. This omission makes the justification less comprehensive, warranting a deduction despite the overall accuracy.
