9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part a (Decision points):** Near-perfect match in identifying and accurately describing the two decision points with one-sentence rules each. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "Underwriting-skip branch (Step 4)" vs. "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; "Acme skips Step 5" vs. "process bypasses"; "€250,000" formatting vs. "€250 000"; "any 2 of the 3 approve" vs. "at least two ... record 'Approve'"; explicit role listing and "participate" vs. parenthetical) and added step references are small deviations but deduct points under strict criteria (-0.5 total). No omissions or inaccuracies.

**Part b (Documents list):** Exact match on all 9 documents in correct first-appearance order. Deductions for unrequested caveat on Deck Memo ("*(only when Step 5 is not skipped)*"), which qualifies an unconditional list item (-0.3); minor bolding/formatting differences; and extra accurate KYC parenthetical not in ground truth (-0.2). No hallucinations.

Overall: Highly faithful (95%+ semantic/content alignment), but strict deduction for non-identical phrasing, extras, and formatting yields 9.0.
