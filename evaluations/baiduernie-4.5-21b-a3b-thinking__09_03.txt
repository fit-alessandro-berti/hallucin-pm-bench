8.5

The LLM answer is highly similar to the ground truth in core content, correctly identifying the redaction of event-log data (including timestamps) as the precise reason metrics cannot be computed, and tying this to the impossibility of calculations for the specified activity. It accurately dismisses Artefact B's irrelevance without guessing or using external knowledge, and maintains a single short paragraph structure. However, minor deductions are warranted for: (1) extraneous header ("### Response"), violating the "plain text, no tables" instruction; (2) use of bold formatting, introducing unnecessary markup; (3) slightly longer and less concise phrasing compared to the ground truth's succinct "Impossible —" opener and direct focus; (4) explicit mention of Artefact B, which adds detail but deviates from the ground truth's streamlined explanation without enhancing precision; and (5) omission of the specific tie to "“Approve Invoice” execution" and "dispersion" terminology, introducing subtle wording variances. These small structural and stylistic differences, under utmost strictness, reduce the score from a perfect match.
