7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence, correctly identified in case 1002). No errors. Full credit.
- **Question 2**: Partial alignment (â‰¤120 words, addresses small sample and naming variations as reasons for misestimation). Strengths: Covers sample size limitation and label inconsistencies similar to ground truth's synonym issue. However, significant deductions for: (1) Introducing unsubstantiated speculation (e.g., "fraud spikes," "weekend trends"), violating the "no speculation" rule; (2) Omitting key statistical insights from ground truth (e.g., frequency volatility from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, rare-event sampling error); (3) Minor inaccuracy (claims "linear paths" despite repeat "Send Offer" in case 1001); (4) Less precise quantification (e.g., "1.5 hours" vs. ground truth's "<2 hours" and event count). These differences reduce fidelity, especially under strict criteria. Total word adherence is fine (118 words).
