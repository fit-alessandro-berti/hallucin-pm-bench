**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high base score)**: Correctly identifies *all* changes with precise content matching ground truth (3 added tasks, 1 removed task, 1 gateway change). Uses exact task names from XML. Headings match prompt exactly (including "(e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)" in gateway heading). Ignores cosmetics correctly (e.g., name changes on retained tasks like Task_ApproveLoan).
- **Errors/Differences (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Missing task IDs** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`, etc.): Critical for BPMN XML precision (meticulous analyst); 4 instances (-1.0 total).
  - **No numbering** (ground truth uses 1., 2., 3.): Structural mismatch (-0.5).
  - **No bolding/italics** or semantic details (e.g., "exclusive (XOR)" vs raw "exclusiveGateway"; no "*v1* to *v2*"): Less descriptive (-0.3).
  - **No closing note** ("No other..."): Omits confirmation of completeness (-0.2).
  - Minor formatting (bullets vs structured lists): Further divergence (-0.0, as content-led).
- Overall: Near-perfect content (9.5+ potential), but small precision/formatting gaps cause strict loss to 8.0. Identical content would be 10.0.
