The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses the violation in Rule 3 as the key issue, with correct reasoning for Rules 2 and 4. It also ultimately marks Rule 1 as satisfied with the right conclusion (QE precedes RA and occurs once). However, strict evaluation deducts points for: (1) a sloppy, self-contradictory justification in Rule 1 (initially states "Violated" before correcting to satisfied, creating confusion); (2) a minor but erroneous typo ("QA" instead of "QE"); and (3) less structured presentation compared to the ground truth's clear table format, which affects precision despite fulfilling the prompt's requirement for a short justification referencing rules. These small but noticeable flaws warrant a deduction from a perfect score.
