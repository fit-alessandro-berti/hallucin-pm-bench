The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and justifies by accurately citing the two relevant counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with their precise sequences, directly disproving the "always" claim as required. This aligns well with the ground truth's core reasoning. However, it loses a full point for lacking the ground truth's exhaustive case-by-case coverage of all four cases (omitting the confirming sequences in C001 and C003), which provides fuller evidentiary support and explicit quantification of violations (e.g., "two out of four"), making the response slightly less meticulous and comprehensive despite no factual errors.
