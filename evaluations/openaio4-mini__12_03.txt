The LLM answer is correct in both its Yes/No judgment ("No") and in its justification by explicitly citing the two counterexamples (C002 and C004), giving the precise intermediate activities. However, the answer is less detailed than the ground truth because:

- It does not confirm the cases where the immediate succession *does* hold (C001 and C003).
- It does not provide a systematic, case-by-case evaluation or a table.
- The explanation could be enhanced by stating clearly the proportion (e.g., "2 out of 4 cases violate the rule").

These omissions result in some loss of rigor, detail, and completeness. Thus, a significant but not maximal deduction is warranted.
