9.0

The LLM answer is solid and accurate, matching nearly all details of the ground truth. It correctly identifies the non-compliance ("No") and gives justifications referencing each rule:

- Rule 1: Correct, order and occurrence identified as satisfied.
- Rule 2: Correct, sequencing described and confirmed as satisfied.
- Rule 3: Correct, violation properly described (NA before RA).
- Rule 4: LLM gives a slightly less explicit evaluation; its assertion that the prior violation renders Rule 4 "irrelevant" is not strictly as clear or positive as the ground truth's affirmative assessment. The ground truth specifies that CC is satisfied, noting order even though the trace is already non-compliant due to earlier violations.

The omission of an explicit confirmation (✔ Satisfied) for Rule 4 should be considered a minor error, as auditors would expect clear assessments for all rules regardless of previous violations.

Otherwise, the LLM answer is concise, correct, and does not deviate on key points.  
**Deduction:** 1 point, due to insufficient explicitness about Rule 4’s evaluation.

**Final score:** 9.0
