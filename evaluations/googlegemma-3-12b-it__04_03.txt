The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses Rules 1, 2, and 3 with justifications that align closely with the ground truth (satisfied for 1 and 2; violated for 3 due to NA preceding RA). However, under utmost strictness, it deducts points for the minor error in Rule 4: while implying the order is met ("NA appears before CC"), it incorrectly deems the rule "irrelevant" due to the prior violation instead of explicitly affirming it as satisfied (as the ground truth does with âœ” and clear reasoning that CC follows both NA and VP). This introduces a subtle inaccuracy in rule-by-rule assessment. Format differences (bullets vs. table) are negligible for a "short justification," but the phrasing for Rule 3 is slightly less precise (omits emphasis on "both" QE and RA).
