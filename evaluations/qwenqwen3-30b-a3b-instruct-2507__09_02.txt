7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamp information and provides a concise single-sentence explanation as instructed in the prompt. However, it loses points for being less precise and detailed than the ground truth: it omits explicit mention of the lack of duration information, the presence of only event counts, and the specific absence of start-to-completion intervals, which are key elements in the expected reasoning for why computation is impossible. Under strict evaluation, these omissions constitute small but significant gaps in completeness and explanatory depth, warranting a deduction from a perfect score.
