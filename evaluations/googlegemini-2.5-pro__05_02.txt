7.5

The LLM answer is quite close to the ground truth but contains some minor issues resulting in a noticeable deduction:

- The XML diff is correct, precisely matching the expected change, and presents the modification as a proper single-hunk diff, targeting only the camunda:dueDate attribute of the correct element.
- The rationale is accurate in spirit and intention, pointing out the reduction in due date and the effect on the critical path and process SLA.

However, the following deviations merit a deduction:

1. The diff output *includes surrounding context lines that aren't minimally necessary* (“beyond a single-hunk, one-line diff”). The ground truth is minimalist, while the LLM’s diff also displays neighboring lines that are unchanged, potentially making it less precise according to ultra-strict expectations in this context.
2. The rationale, while conceptually correct, is slightly less direct than the ground truth. It asserts the due date was “excessively long” and references “most likely cause” and “critical path,” whereas the ground truth specifically connects the change to the “contractual 3-day SLA,” making the business impact more explicit and concrete.

In sum:  
- Correct element and attribute modified: **no error**  
- Diff context verbosity (not strictly minimal): **−0.5**  
- Rationale: correct but less specific and direct relative to the reference: **−2.0**

**Result: 7.5**
