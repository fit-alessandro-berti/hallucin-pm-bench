The LLM answer perfectly identifies the two correct parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring A), lists them in the required alphabetical order (within pairs and overall, C-pair before P-pair), and outputs one per line in the specified format. Minor whitespace variations around the em dash and lack of monospaced alignment padding or code block fences do not constitute substantive errors under the prompt's instructions, as no alignment or markdown was mandated—only the pair format, which is matched in structure and content. Exact string match is not required beyond semantics and specified ordering/formatting skeleton; content fidelity is 100%.
