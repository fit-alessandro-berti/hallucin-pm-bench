4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict criteria applied):
- **Headings**: LLM adds leading "-" (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS"), violating "verbatim" requirement. Ground truth uses plain headings. (-1.0)
- **ADDED TASKS**: Exact match (3 items, correct format). (+3.0)
- **REMOVED TASKS**: Missing name in parentheses "(Manual Review)" despite explicit instruction "id followed by the `name` in parentheses" for tasks. No bullet consistency. (-1.5)
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: Misses *Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel* (verifiable: v1 `<exclusiveGateway>`, v2 `<parallelGateway>`), listing only 1/2 changes despite "*all* functional changes". Format otherwise matches. (-2.5)
- **Overall structure/output purity**: Extra markdown-like formatting; no commentary (good), but not "only the three required headings and the concrete differences." Total: 4.0 (partial credit for ~70% content accuracy, heavy deductions for omissions and format deviations).
