The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of calculation due to missing timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning, but it is slightly less precise by not explicitly mentioning the absence of duration information, event counts only, or the need for start-to-completion intervals, resulting in a minor deduction for incomplete elaboration despite the prompt's call for conciseness.
