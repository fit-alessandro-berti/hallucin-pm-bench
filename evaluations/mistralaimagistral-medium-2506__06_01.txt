9.5

The LLM answer is nearly perfect. It identifies both correct pairs, lists them with the correct alphabetical order within pairs, and provides a clear rationale. The format is slightly off: the expected answer aligns the items in each pair with added whitespace for perfect columns ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"), while the LLM answer omits those extra spaces, providing "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" (with only two spaces before and after the em dash). According to the instruction on strict grading, this small formatting error warrants a significant point deduction, leading to a 0.5-point deduction. Otherwise, the substance and structure are correct.
