The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two parallel pairs from Process B in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), using a close approximation of the specified format. No additional or incorrect pairs are included, and the core content matches the ground truth's listed pairs. However, deductions are applied strictly for the following differences: (1) inclusion of unnecessary introductory text not present in the ground truth; (2) lack of vertical alignment in the formatted output (e.g., the em dashes "—" are not aligned in monospace as in the ground truth's second line, which uses extra spaces for presentation); (3) a less detailed and unheadered explanatory section that does not quote the process description verbatim or use the ground truth's structure/phrasing (e.g., no "*Rationale*" header or specific citations like “begin in parallel”); and (4) minor spacing inconsistencies around the em dashes compared to the ground truth's precise formatting. These are small but cumulative errors in fidelity to the ground truth's exact presentation and detail level.
