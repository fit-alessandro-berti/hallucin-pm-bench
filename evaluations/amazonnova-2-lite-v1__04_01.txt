**4.0**

The LLM answer correctly concludes "Non-compliant" and accurately identifies the violations of Rules 2 and 3 with appropriate citations and details matching the ground truth (e.g., Expedite_Flag triggering Risk_Assessment timing issue; Three_way_match distance exceeding limit post-Goods_Received). It also correctly notes Rule 1 and 5 compliance. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major error on Rule 4**: Falsely claims violation, misinterpreting the rule (applies prohibition to "System" role at line 5 instead of only "Intern"; ignores line 4 intervening; contradicts rule text). Ground truth correctly marks satisfied. This fabricates a third violation, directly differing from ground truth.
- **Format deviations**: Uses excessive markdown (##, **, ###), splits Rule 2 into 2a/2b unnecessarily, does not mirror ground truth's clean 1-5 structure per rule (satisfied/violated).
- **Extraneous content**: Includes ~1000+ words of leaked chain-of-thought/internal reasoning after main answer, self-contradicting (initially wrong on Rule 4, later self-corrects), proposing a second duplicate answer. Violates specified format ("“Compliant” or “Non-compliant”, followed by a numbered justification").
- **Minor issues**: Rule 3 phrasing ("four activities later" vs. ground truth "distance=3"); unnecessary summary of "three violations".

These are not small errors—core misanalysis of a rule, format non-compliance, and polluted output warrant significant deduction from a perfect 10.0, despite correct overall verdict and partial alignments.
