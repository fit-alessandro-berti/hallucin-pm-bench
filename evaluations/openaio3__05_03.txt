7.0

- The LLM answer captures the correct approach by adding an interrupting boundary timer to Activity_CreateAccount and rerouting to the pre-existing escalation task, which closely follows the intent of the ground truth.
- The timerEventDefinition omits the xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression" attribute on <bpmn:timeDuration>, making its XML definition less precise (significant for strict BPMN 2.0 compliance).
- The IDs of added elements differ ("Boundary_Timer_CreateAccount"/"Flow_Timer_To_AMReview" vs. "Boundary_LateCreate"/"Flow_LateEscalation"); while functionally equivalent, strict evaluation penalizes for divergence.
- The justification is succinct and factually accurate but could be stricter in matching the ground truth's terminology and specificity (e.g., "interrupting 48-hour boundary timer").
- The LLM uses "automatically triggers escalation," which is less explicit than "interrupting" in describing the timer nature.
- No major logic errors, but the combination of XML inaccuracies, terminology gaps, and failure to exactly mirror the ground truth in structure and attribute specificity results in a notable point loss per strict grading.
