The LLM answer is an exact match in factual content, structure, and fidelity to the prompt's requirements: it correctly states "No," provides a single-paragraph justification citing the precise counterexamples (case C003 with lines 6 and 7; case C005 with line 11 and absence of Receive_Order), and directly refutes the claim without extraneous details or errors, aligning perfectly with the ground truth.
