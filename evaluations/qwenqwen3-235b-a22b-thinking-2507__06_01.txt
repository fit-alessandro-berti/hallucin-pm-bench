9.0

The provided LLM answer lists both required task pairs, spelled correctly and formatted as requested. However, it does **not** align exactly with the ground truth on formatting:

- The LLM answer omits vertical alignment (it does not extra-align the paired task names using spaces).
- Otherwise, it gives the correct pairs, in the correct format (`Task_X  â€”  Task_Y`), and in the correct order.

Because the ground truth expects strictly-aligned columns (as indicated by the whitespace in the second pair), this minor formatting miss reduces the score by 1 full point, reflecting "utmost strictness" as requested. All substantive/semantic requirements are otherwise satisfied.
