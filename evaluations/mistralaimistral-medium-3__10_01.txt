6.0

**Justification**:

**Strengths:**
- The answer correctly uses the mandated terminology: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," "Payment Clearance," and never mentions the forbidden terms.
- The activities, rows, and role columns are all correct and match the source process.

**Major Issues:**
- **Incorrect and Incomplete RACI Assignments:**
    - The LLM marks only one role per activity as Responsible, which in itself can be valid, but misses required Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments as shown in the ground truth. For example, in the ground truth "Receive Application," AM is "R/A", CO is "C", FC and IT are "I". The LLM lists only "R" for AM and leaves the rest blank.
    - Similarly, for every activity except the one whose main actor is stated, the matrix is left blank—where additional roles should have been clearly labelled C/I/A, per the reference solution.
    - "A" (Accountable) is omitted entirely in the main matrix, only mentioned in a note, despite appearing explicitly in the ground truth assignments on specific tasks ("R/A" for several activities, and A on others).
    - No "C" (Consulted) or "I" (Informed) appear at all, though the ground truth uses these extensively.
- **Formatting:**
    - The LLM offers each activity with only a single "R" and blanks elsewhere, ignoring that good RACIs often have multiple roles per activity.
    - This leads to loss of about half the information required in a proper RACI matrix.

**Minor Issues:**
- The “Key” is superfluous but acceptable for reader clarity.

**Summary:**  
The strict requirement to reflect small errors in significant point loss means that omitting most of the actual RACI assignments results in a substantial deduction. The correct verbs were used and activities retitled as demanded (+4 points), but the essential mapping of Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed was almost entirely ignored (–4 points). Thus, the output is accurate on terminology, but functionally incomplete as a RACI matrix per explicit instructions.

**Final:** 6.0 (acceptable terminology, but incomplete and incorrect role mapping).
