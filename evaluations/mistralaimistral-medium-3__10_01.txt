The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without forbidden variants, matches the activities and roles without additions, and accurately identifies the single Responsible (R) party per activity based on the process narrative. However, it fails to provide a complete RACI matrix by omitting Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments as shown in the ground truth, resulting in blank cells that do not reflect the detailed interactions (e.g., AM as A for most activities, widespread C and I roles). The added Key and Note introduce unwarranted assumptions (e.g., AM as A overall) not present in the ground truth, and formatting differences (e.g., abbreviations in headers, inconsistent bolding) further diverge. These omissions and extras represent major inaccuracies in content and structure, warranting a low score despite terminology adherence.
