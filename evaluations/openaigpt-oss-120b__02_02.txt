8.5

Rationale:

- Q1 (Distinct cases): Answer is fully correct—both in listing the cases and giving the number 3.

- Q2 (C002 activity sequence): Completely correct. The listed activities, as well as the required "→" separator, all match the expected sequence and formatting exactly.

- Q3 (Activities immediately preceding “Ship_Order”): The core answer is correct, providing "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" in alphabetical order, one per line. However, there is a small but notable precision loss: the LLM writes an introductory bullet list followed by a fenced code block of the two activities. The ground truth demands just a one-item-per-line list. The LLM's inclusion of a summary bullet—and that code block (although sometimes overformatting can be forgiven)—is a small but measurable deviation from concise output.

- There are no errors in the content (no missing or fabricated activities/cases), but the presentation is slightly wordier than requested.

As per the strict guidelines and for even minor presentational differences, this must not be a perfect score. The answer is factually perfect, but strictness about overformatting/double presentation is why it's not 10.

Thus, 8.5/10.
