7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, `gw_valid` type change from exclusive to inclusive), with no extras or misses, fully matching the required categories and adhering to "only" those differences without speculation. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major deductions (-2.0 total)**: Does not use task *names* from XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status") as primary identifier like ground truth; relies solely on ids prefixed with "Task", missing the name(id) format.
- **Moderate deductions (-0.5)**: Gateway phrasing adds unnecessary "Gateway " prefix and omits version labels "(v1)" / "(v2)" and bolding on types.
- **Minor deductions (-0.5)**: Bullet style (• vs *) and lacks confirmatory note "(No other differences should be reported.)".

Semantically accurate (facts perfect), but significant textual/format divergence from ground truth yields 7.0.
