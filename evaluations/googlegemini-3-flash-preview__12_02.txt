The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in structure (No + one-paragraph justification citing exact counterexamples C003 lines 6/7 and C005 line 11), factual accuracy (correctly identifies Validate_Payment preceding or lacking Receive_Order), and proof of "not always" via counterexamples. Minor deductions for: (1) extraneous mention of compliant cases C001/C002/C004 (accurate but absent in ground truth, adding non-essential length); (2) inclusion of timestamps (helpful but not in ground truth); (3) slight phrasing variations (e.g., "prior to" vs. "occurs first... afterwards"; "without any preceding... for that case" vs. "never contains... at all"). No factual errors, but strictness penalizes additions/differences.
