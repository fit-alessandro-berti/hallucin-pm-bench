10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all rule statuses (R1 Compliant, R2/R3/R5 Violated, R4 Not Applicable, R6 Compliant) and overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion. Justifications are accurate, logically equivalent, and all ≤20 words (e.g., R2 explains timing violation without dates but correctly identifies pre-approval shipment issue; minor phrasing variations like added explanatory clauses in R1/R5/R6 do not alter facts or exceed limits). Format adheres to prompt without extraneous elements. No errors or deviations.
