7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h/120.0h; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quotes the required metrics verbatim from the table, and stays under 150 words (~120). It avoids discussing service times, throughput, or extraneous activities, adhering to core constraints.

However, under strict evaluation:
- **Unwarranted content (significant deduction)**: Includes executions range (255–320), which references throughput metrics explicitly forbidden by the prompt. Adds unsolicited "COO Next Steps" section, introducing irrelevant executive fluff not in the ground truth or required.
- **Action quality (moderate deduction)**: Actions are concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues, with #1 explicitly promising ≥20% reduction. However, #2 and #3 lack any quantified ≥20% claim (just vague "cut" or "reduce"), and none are truly "data-driven"—no references to pilots, estimates, or table-derived insights, unlike the ground truth's specifics (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%"). This misses the prompt's emphasis on data-backed recommendations.
- **Format and conciseness (minor deduction)**: Elaborate memo style with bolding/titles is crisp but deviates from ground truth's plain, list-like structure; small phrasing differences (e.g., "Avg. waiting time" vs. "avg X h") compound under utmost strictness.

Core correctness is strong, but extras, incomplete quantification, and lack of data ties warrant a 7.5—solid but flawed against the ground truth benchmark.
