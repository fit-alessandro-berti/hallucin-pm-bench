7.0

**Evaluation**

- **Correct activities and order**: The LLM answer lists the correct three worst activities (“Request_Documents”, “Send_Closure_Letter”, “Assess_Liability”) and ranks them correctly, with accurately quoted average and 95th percentile waiting times. (No deduction)
- **Numbers**: Waiting time figures are accurate and quoted as required. (No deduction)
- **Unwarranted content**:  
    - The brief “executions: 255–320” line unnecessarily refers to execution counts, which violates the instruction to omit all non-waiting metrics. (-1.5)
    - The line “COO Next Steps: Approve pilot for #1 (highest impact)” is unsolicited advice outside the three required actions. (-1)
- **Action recommendations**:  
    - #1: The “automated document reminders” matches ground truth in spirit; “SMS/email escalation” is reasonable but a bit vague compared to the specific “24 h escalation triggers” and “pilot tests show ≥25 % cut” from the model answer. (-0.5)
    - #2: “Batch-process closure letters daily (vs. ad hoc)” is reasonable but *less* impactful than the ground truth’s “same-day e-signature,” which is more digital and directly aims for immediate delivery. It also fails to promise a quantifiable reduction or technological improvement. (-0.5)
    - #3: “Pre-allocate assessors based on claim complexity” is less precise and actionable than “rules-engine pre-classification so simple cases bypass senior adjuster queue”; the former is broad and open to interpretation, the latter offers a concrete mechanism. (-0.5)
- **Brevity & word count**: The memo is within the word limit. (No deduction)

**Summary**:  
The answer identifies, ranks, and quotes the correct activities and numbers, but introduces unnecessary (forbidden) content outside of the required metrics, and the actions are less specific, concrete, and data-driven than those in the ground truth. The overall structure is clear and executive-appropriate, but the answer fails to strictly meet all instructions, especially in action detail and omission of non-waiting info.

**Final score: 7.0**
