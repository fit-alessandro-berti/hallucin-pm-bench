**7.2**

### Reasoning for score (strict evaluation vs ground truth):
- **Strengths (add points)**: Faithful to description—no invented escalation/supervisor steps. Correctly models start (message for email), classification exclusive split with conditions, complex root cause, parallel fork/join for send/log (superior positioning vs GT's early join), event-based gateway + timer PT24H for 24h wait/reply vs reminder+close, close logic, termination. Includes parse+create task (GT merges/omits parse). Event subprocess properly handles "cancel at any point" (GT's cancel unconnected/incomplete).
- **Weaknesses (deduct points, strict)**:
  - **Schema/structure mismatch** (-1.5): Detailed BPMN export-style (nodes/sequenceFlows/eventSubProcesses) vs GT's simple flat "elements"/"flows". Significant diff.
  - **Additional gateways hallucinated/absent from GT** (-1.0): Unnecessary ExclusiveGateway_Merge (classify reconverge doesn't require it), ExclusiveGateway_ReplyMerge (necessary for parJoin but "additional" per note). Penalized heavily.
  - **Name differences** (-0.2): Start ("Support Email Received" vs "Email Received"), parse ("Parse...Create" vs "Create Ticket"), timer ("24 Hours Elapsed" vs "Timer 24h"), event GW ("Await..." vs "Wait..."), end ("Ticket Closed" vs "End"), unnamed nulls vs GT names.
  - **Minor diffs** (-0.1): Conditions ("ticketType == 'Simple'" vs "simple"), extra props (isExecutable, detailed eventDefs).
- **Base 10, net deductions = 2.8 → 7.2**. Semantically ~95% match (superior in places), but strict syntactic/structural diffs and extras cost dearly. No major logic errors.
