9.2

The LLM answer is semantically accurate, concise, and correctly identifies the core issue (lack of timestamps needed for start-to-complete duration), directly addressing the prompt. However, under utmost strictness:
- Minor deduction (-0.5) for phrasing "event log header does not include any timestamps" (slightly narrow, as the explicit note "no timestamps were released" is in the table description, and ground truth broadly says "no timestamps or duration information are provided—only event counts").
- Minor deduction (-0.3) for not explicitly noting "only event counts" or "duration information absent" / "intervals absent", making it less comprehensive than ground truth.
No factual errors, but wording differences prevent a perfect 10.0.
