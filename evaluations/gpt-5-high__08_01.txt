6.0

**Analysis:**

- The LLM answer correctly determines that T5 can fire before T3, gives a concrete valid firing sequence, and provides a brief justification.
- **Major issue**: The sequence stops after T5, does not mention firing T3 or T4 at all, and does not acknowledge that T5 can *never* fire after T3. 
- The explanation is missing the key proof or justification stated in the ground truth: that **T3 adds the token to p4, which disables T5 forever, so T5 must occur before T3 if ever**.
- The ground truth answer completes the sequence (including T3 and T4) and explicitly states the logical reasoning and necessity behind the order, while the LLM is only partial.
- The LLM's sequence is a valid prefix, but implies T5 consumes p3 but leaves p2, so whether T3 remains enabled in general is not discussed.
- The LLM answer fails to mention why, after T3, T5 is impossible, which is **central** to the proof required by the prompt.

**Strictness:**
- -1.5 for incomplete sequence.
- -1.5 for missing the crucial logical explanation/proof.
- -0.5 for not discussing disabling condition (permanent disabling after T3 fires).
- -0.5 for minor lack of precision/rigor in explanation.
