**9.2**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and directly addresses the prompt with a correct "Yes", a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, and a solid brief justification emphasizing the inhibitor arc and p4=0 precondition (tied to T3 not firing yet). Markings are explicitly listed (minor omission of p0=0 post-T1/T2 is negligible in context, as p0 is irrelevant after T1). No factual errors; avoids ground truth's invalid T4 firing step post-T5 (impossible since p3=0).

Differences from ground truth (causing minor deduction under strictness):
- Shorter sequence (stops correctly after T5; doesn't include extraneous valid T3 or erroneous T4).
- Misses stronger "must fire before T3 if ever" claim and permanent disablement proof (though unrequired for prompt).
- Stylistic: Extra role-play intro ("liveness/reachability graph"), fuller markings, "race condition" phrasing vs. ground truth's compact format and precise enabling formula.
- No significant loss for these; core match is >95% (sequence/justification substance identical).

Small presentation omissions (e.g., post-T5 full marking) deduct 0.8 total.
