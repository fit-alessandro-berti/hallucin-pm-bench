9.0

- Question 1: The LLM answer gives only "3" instead of a more complete "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)". The omission of the case identifiers is a notable lack of detail compared to the ground truth.
- Question 2: "Pack_Items" — Correct.
- Question 3: "Cancel_Order" — Correct.

Overall, the LLM answer is factually correct for all questions, but lacks the explicit enumeration of case identifiers for Q1. According to the instruction to penalize even small errors, this results in the answer receiving 9.0 out of 10.0.
