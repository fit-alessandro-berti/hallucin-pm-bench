- The LLM answer is correct and concise per the prompt's instructions.  
- For Q1, it provides the exact count (3) but omits the explicit listing of cases (C123, C456, C789) and the word "cases" as in the ground truth, which is a minor formatting/verbosity difference under strict evaluation.  
- Q2 and Q3 match the ground truth verbatim.
