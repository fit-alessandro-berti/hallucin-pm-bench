4.0

**Evaluation:**
- **R1:** Correct. Both answers state compliant, with correct justification.
- **R2:** INCORRECT. LLM marks as Compliant, but ground truth is Violated: Ship_Goods occurred before new Manager_Approval after Change_Request; hence, the "last required approval" should be the 07-Mar approval, not the earlier 04-Mar one. LLM failed to consider the need for new Manager_Approval post Change_Request, resulting in a significant error.
- **R3:** Correct. Both mark as Violated, with accurate justification.
- **R4:** Correct. Both mark as Not Applicable, proper justification.
- **R5:** INCORRECT. LLM marks as Compliant; ground truth is Violated because Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before the new required Manager_Approval post-Change_Request.
- **R6:** Correct. Both mark as Compliant.
- **Overall:** LLM correctly concludes NON-COMPLIANT, but its reasoning is undercut by misapplication of R2 and R5.

**Major Issues:**  
- Rule R2 and R5 errors are severe, as they reflect incorrect process understanding.
- Justifications are close in form and length, but substance is flawed for R2 and R5.
- Only 4/6 rules match in status; 2 are significant and fundamental errors.

**Conclusion:**  
Due to two critical compliance rule misjudgments, the score is strictly limited to **4.0**.
