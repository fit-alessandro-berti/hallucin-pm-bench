The LLM answer correctly identifies statuses and justifications for R1, R3, R4, and R6, matching the ground truth. However, it errs significantly on R2 (incorrectly deems compliant by ignoring the re-approval on 2025-03-07 as the "last required approval" post-Change_Request, missing the >2-day violation for expedited shipping) and R5 (incorrectly deems compliant by overlooking that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before the new Manager_Approval, violating the "no further processing step" clause). These are major interpretive failures on two rules, leading to incomplete violation detection despite the correct overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion. Format is mostly adhered to, but errors warrant substantial deduction under strict criteria.
