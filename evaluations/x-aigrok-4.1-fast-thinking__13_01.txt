**9.5**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and adheres closely to the ground truth, with no hallucinations or inferences beyond the log data. Minor deductions for:
- Q1: Missing "occurrence" (ideal: "`1` occurrence"; strict loss of 0.3).
- Q2: Formatting ("5.56%" vs. "5.56 %"; no space before %; loss of 0.1).
- Q3: Concise listing ("A1002") matches "list the case identifier(s)" but omits verbose ideal phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains..."); loss of 0.1.

Q4 perfectly covers two valid reasons (small sample size; temporal bias) with clear, log-derived explanations matching ground truth criteria. Overall exemplary under strict evaluation.
