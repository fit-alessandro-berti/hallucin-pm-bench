### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1 (Perfect match)**: The LLM correctly identifies 1 occurrence, aligning exactly with the ground truth and data. No deductions here (full 10/10 for this part).
- **Question 2 (Major issues, significant deductions)**: The response is under 120 words and captures the basic idea of small sample size leading to misestimation (3 cases, one occurrence). However, it deviates substantially:
  - **Omissions (critical)**: No mention of the tiny event count (14 events), short time span (<2 hours vs. full month), frequency volatility (e.g., swinging from 0% to 7% with one change), wide confidence intervals, or sampling error for rare events—core to ground truth's emphasis on unreliability.
  - **Key miss on string matching**: Ground truth highlights near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and risks of strict vs. fuzzy matching distorting estimates; LLM ignores this entirely, despite the prompt's focus on "exact" string.
  - **Inaccuracies/Additions**: Frames frequency as ~33% (cases-based, misleading); speculates on full log ("higher or lower depending on volume, fraud patterns, or system changes")—violates "no speculation" rule. Ground truth avoids this, sticking to data-driven pitfalls.
  - These differences reduce depth, precision, and fidelity; even minor framing errors (e.g., % calculation) compound under strict criteria, warranting heavy penalty (3/10 for this part).
- **Overall**: Weighted average reflects strong Q1 but flawed Q2; strictness penalizes omissions/speculation as major divergences from ground truth's analytical rigor.
