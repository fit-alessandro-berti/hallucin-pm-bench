### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is largely accurate in identifying the three core decision points and listing all required documents without introducing extraneous terminology. However, under utmost strictness, several omissions and minor inaccuracies warrant significant deductions:

#### Decision Points (Major Issues: -2.5 points total)
- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: The description omits critical context from the process flow (e.g., it occurs as a "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split," specifying "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B"). It also simplifies the escalation without fully stating "escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break," reducing precision. Ground truth provides this exact detail for completeness.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: Misses the positional context ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") and precise phrasing ("send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" vs. vague "forward to the board"). This disrupts fidelity to the "exact terminology and flow."
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: Minor, but "votes approve or reject the request" deviates slightly from ground truth's "votes **Approve** or **Reject**" (capitalization and no "the request"). Hyphenation ("Micro‑loan" vs. "Micro-loan") is inconsistent.
- Structure: Bold headings and numbering are reasonable, but ground truth uses more descriptive sub-bullets for branches (e.g., "⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate"), which the LLM flattens, losing nuance.

These omissions make the summary less comprehensive than the ground truth, which ties decisions explicitly to prior steps— a key aspect of the prompt's emphasis on "exact terminology and flow."

#### Required Documents (Minor Issues: -1.5 points total)
- All six documents are listed correctly, matching the ground truth's complete set.
- Phrasing deviations: "Proof of Address (‑ ≤ 3 months old)" adds extraneous "old" (ground truth: "≤ 3 months"); "Latest Income Statement (single pay‑stub or tax slip)" inserts "single" and uses "or" instead of "/"; "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds "template" (ground truth: "(CIS)"). These are small but introduce non-exact wording.
- Formatting: Bullet points vs. numbered list is acceptable, but the ground truth includes a clarifying note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") emphasizing the non-standard nature (aligning with the system's ⚠️ warning). Omitting this reduces adherence to the prompt's intent to avoid "standard loan terminology."
- No major additions or omissions, but the extras subtly alter precision.

Overall, the answer is 80-85% aligned but penalized heavily for missing flow-context details and subtle wording errors, as per strict criteria. A perfect score would mirror the ground truth verbatim in structure, detail, and emphasis.
