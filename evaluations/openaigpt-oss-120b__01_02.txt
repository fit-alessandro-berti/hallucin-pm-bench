8.0

**Justification:**

- **Decision Points:**
    - The LLM answer identifies all 3 decision points and uses the correct activity names from the process.
    - However, it fails to clearly state the **sequence/branch locations** (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split," "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which are present in the ground truth and provide important process context. This omission detracts from the precision required.
    - The LLM omits the explicit description of what happens if the Underwriter Alignment Gate fails (escalation to Harmonisation Committee), which is a material process branch point outlined in the ground truth.

- **Required Documents:**
    - Lists all documents correctly, uses exact terminology, and matches the ground truth closely.
    - The format is slightly different (bullets vs numbers), but this is an acceptable variation given the prompt.
    - The inclusion of “template” in “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” is a harmless detail (the ground truth simply says “CIS”), but not incorrect.

**Summary:**
- The answer is accurate and well-aligned with process terminology and requirements.
- Small but important omissions regarding process branching, details, and explicit escalation cost 2 points (down to 8.0).
- There are no major terminology or document list errors.
