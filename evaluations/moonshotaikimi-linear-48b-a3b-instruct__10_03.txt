3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Positive, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer strictly uses the mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", or "Sanctions Check"). This matches the ground truth exactly on terminology.
- **Table Structure (Major Deduction, -3.0 points)**: The output uses a non-standard RACI format with separate columns for Responsible, Accountable, etc., listing role names explicitly. The ground truth uses the conventional RACI matrix format (activities in rows, roles in columns, with symbols like "R, A", "C", "–" in cells). This is a fundamental mismatch, violating the expectation of a proper "RACI matrix" as Markdown table.
- **Activities Coverage (Major Deduction, -2.5 points)**: The prompt specifies covering "every activity and role described above" without adding, renaming, or merging. The LLM includes the four core activities but adds "Payment Release" (a partial/renamed interpretation of "Treasury Ops releases the funds") while omitting the escalation/approval step (implied as a distinct activity in the narrative: "escalate for Compliance Officer approval"). The ground truth explicitly includes "**Compliance Officer Approval**" and "**Release Funds**" as separate activities to fully cover the process (e.g., approval for high-risk, release post-approval). This results in incomplete coverage and unauthorized addition/renaming.
- **RACI Assignments (Strict Deduction, -1.0 points total, with breakdowns)**:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Partially correct (Responsible: Front-Office Analyst matches), but Accountable incorrectly assigned to Compliance Analyst (ground truth: Front-Office Analyst as R, A; Compliance Analyst as C; Treasury Ops as I; Officer as –). Missing Consulted and Informed; no dashes for no involvement.
  - **KYC Review**: Responsible and Accountable correctly Compliance Analyst; Consulted correctly Compliance Officer. But Informed incorrectly Front-Office Analyst (ground truth: Treasury Ops as I; Front-Office as –).
  - **AML Screening**: Responsible and Accountable correctly Compliance Analyst, but missing Consulted (Compliance Officer in ground truth) and Informed (Treasury Ops in ground truth). Inconsistent with KYC treatment despite narrative grouping.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Responsible (Compliance Analyst) and Accountable (Compliance Officer) partially align, but ground truth specifies Front-Office Analyst as C, Compliance Analyst as R only (not A), and Treasury Ops as I. Missing Consulted and Informed entries.
  - **Payment Release** (added activity): Responsible (Treasury Ops) and Informed (Front-Office Analyst) partially align with ground truth's "Release Funds", but Accountable (Compliance Officer) is correct; however, ground truth includes Consulted for Compliance Analyst and Officer, which are omitted. This unauthorized activity further penalizes completeness.
  - Overall: No use of "R, A" notation for dual roles (as in ground truth); empty cells instead of "–"; roles not fully mapped across all (e.g., Treasury Ops under-involved in early activities per ground truth's consistent "I").
- **Other Notes**: The output is concise and Markdown-formatted, but ignores the narrative's full flow (e.g., notification to "originating analyst" implies Informed role for Front-Office in later steps, but not consistently applied). Strict evaluation demands near-exact match to ground truth for high scores; multiple mismatches (structure, completeness, specifics) warrant a low-mid score despite vocab adherence. Baseline 10.0 minus deductions = 3.5.
