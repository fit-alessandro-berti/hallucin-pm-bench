The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) as the ground truth, with a concise explanation that accurately describes the token flow to enable T5 before T3, staying under 120 words. However, it lacks the explicit marking notations (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}) and the additional insight on T3's subsequent disabling, which adds precision and confirmation in the ground truth. This reduces completeness, warranting a deduction under strict evaluation for minor differences in detail and structure.
