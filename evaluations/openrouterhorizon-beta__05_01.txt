The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core suggestion (interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive with PT48H, new flow to Task_Triage for bypass/escalation, no new tasks). It preserves plain English, stays under 120 words, and references relevant elements. Minor deductions for: using "e.g." for new IDs instead of specifying (e.g., "Timer_48h"); lacking the XML snippet for timeDuration; slightly redundant phrasing on "interrupting"; and listing bypassed tasks explicitly vs. ground truth's concise "outstanding document requests." These are small stylistic/precision gaps but not substantive errors.
