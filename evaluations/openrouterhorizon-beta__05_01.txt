The LLM answer captures the main idea of the ground truth: attach an interrupting boundary timer event to Task_Receive for a 48-hour SLA, and if triggered, route directly to Task_Triage, ensuring the process meets the SLA. It properly mentions not adding tasks and references element IDs. 

However, two notable errors cause significant point loss:
- The LLM suggests naming a flow "f2_timeout" but does NOT explicitly name the new boundary event as "Timer_48h" or the sequence flow as in the ground truth, nor does it use exact element IDs throughout, as the ground truth does.
- It ambiguously allows for the normal path to continue if not interrupted, without clearly stating the interrupting nature as strongly as the ground truth (which stresses "interrupting" and that no outstanding document requests will block triage on timeout).

Otherwise, the improvement is accurate and well explained. Due to strictness, these minor but meaningful lapses cost it 2 points.
