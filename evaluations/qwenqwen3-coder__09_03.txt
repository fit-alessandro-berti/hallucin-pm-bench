The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly identifying the impossibility of computation due to the redacted event log, emphasizing the absence of timestamps and rows in Artefact A, and explaining the lack of data for "Approve Invoice" metrics. It precisely mirrors the prompt's requirements for standard deviation and 95% confidence interval while staying within a single short paragraph of explanation without guessing. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., explicitly mentioning case IDs and activity data, which are implied but not emphasized in the ground truth) and referencing the irrelevant SLA from Artefact B (adding context not present in the ground truth), but these do not alter the core accuracy or introduce errors.
