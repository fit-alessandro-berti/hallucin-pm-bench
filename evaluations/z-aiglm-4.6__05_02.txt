The LLM answer proposes the exact same XML modification (changing the dueDate from P5D to P2D for the Collect Equipment task), which directly matches the ground truth's core change and adheres to the rules without adding/deleting elements. However, it loses points for minor differences: the diff includes unnecessary file headers and extra context lines (making it less minimal than the ground truth's single-hunk format), and the rationale omits specific details like the "5 days to 2 days" quantification and the "3-day SLA" reference while adding unprompted phrasing like "primary bottleneck," introducing slight deviation from the ground truth's precise wording despite both being one sentence.
