6.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision Points (major deductions: ~4 points lost)**:
  - Identifies 2/3 ground truth points correctly (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision), but omits the critical 3rd: **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as an explicit decision (board votes *Approve* or *Reject*).
  - Lacks precise contextual phrasing from ground truth: "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check".
  - Minor rephrasing errors: "differ by **more than 2 points**" (GT: "differ by >2 implied as else"); "auto-approved" vs. "system auto-approves"; "proceeds to" vs. "send to".
  - Structure mismatches: No "#### Decision points" header style; uses asterisks (*) instead of arrows (⇒); no concise single-line summary format.

- **Required Documents (minor deductions: ~0.8 points lost)**:
  - Lists all 6 documents correctly and completely.
  - Wording deviations from ground truth: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"; bulleted vs. numbered list.
  - Omits ground truth's "(complete list)" header phrasing, numbering, and emphatic note: "*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*".

- **Overall**: Incomplete (missing key decision point), imprecise, and structurally divergent despite following prompt's terminology. Strict penalty for omissions and non-verbatim fidelity yields 6.2 (not lower due to core content accuracy on listed items).
