3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Structure and Formatting (Significant Deduction)**: The LLM answer uses a basic Markdown table without bolding mandated terms (e.g., **KYC Review** is not emphasized as in ground truth), lacks the "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header phrasing, omits the Legend, and does not include the explanatory note about using enforced synonyms and mapping. Ground truth has precise formatting with dashes and bolding. This is a core presentation error, costing ~2 points.
- **Roles/Columns (Major Deduction)**: LLM includes only Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst, and IT Supportâ€”missing Operations Manager entirely, which is present in ground truth as the primary Accountable role across tasks. This leads to incomplete RACI coverage (many tasks lack an "A" in LLM, violating standard RACI principles implied in ground truth). Strict penalty for omission of a key column (~2 points loss).
- **Tasks/Activities (Major Deduction)**: LLM covers 8 tasks, adding "Send SWIFT message" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison after archiving" as explicit rows, which ground truth omits or combines (e.g., no separate send; archiving lacks notify). Task phrasings differ: "Log transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review for sender and beneficiary" vs. simply "**KYC Review**"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record." Ground truth uses more concise, mandated-aligned wording without extras. These additions and mismatches indicate over-interpretation and deviation, costing ~2.5 points.
- **RACI Assignments (Partial Credit, but Significant Errors)**: Some alignments exist (e.g., Transaction Analyst as R for screening and release; Regulatory Liaison as R for KYC Review; IT Support as R for archiving). However, most differ substantially: e.g., ground truth has Regulatory Liaison as A for screening (LLM blank); multiple C/I/A roles per task in ground truth (LLM often leaves blanks); approve task has Regulatory as R in ground truth vs. A in LLM. No matches for Operations Manager roles. Small inconsistencies (e.g., Notify row has misplaced I under Regulatory but blank for Analyst) compound errors, deducting ~1.5 points despite partial overlaps.
- **Vocabulary and Fidelity to Prompt/Source (Minor Credit)**: LLM strictly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions, and maps source steps reasonably (e.g., no unmandated roles like "Operations Manager"). It covers all source steps without omissions. This adherence prevents a total zero but doesn't offset structural deviations from ground truth.

Overall, the LLM answer is faithful to the source informal description but diverges significantly from the ground truth in completeness, assignments, and presentation, warranting a low-mid score under strict criteria.
