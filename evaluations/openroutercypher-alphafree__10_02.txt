4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates partial understanding and appropriate use of some mandated terms, but displays several significant deviations from the ground truth in role assignment, activity coverage, structure, and RACI rigor:

**Positives:**
- Consistently uses “KYC Review,” “Regulatory Liaison,” and “Transaction Analyst” as prescribed.
- Presents the RACI as a Markdown table.
- Covers most major process steps.

**Negatives (substantial point deductions):**
1. **Omission of “Operations Manager”:**  The LLM answer does not include the “Operations Manager” column, present in the ground truth. Since "Accountable" role is crucial and mapped to Operations Manager for most tasks in ground truth, this omission is serious.

2. **Incorrect/Incomplete RACI assignments:**
    - Frequently maps “Responsible” and “Accountable” together (e.g., the Regulatory Liaison as both for KYC Review, whereas ground truth separates 'Responsible' and 'Accountable' roles).
    - Leaves “Accountable” out for most tasks — ground truth specifies clear accountabilities (mostly Operations Manager) that are missed.
    - “Consulted” and “Informed” roles are often not applied or misapplied (e.g., “Notify Regulatory Liaison after archiving” is not structured as in ground truth).
    - The LLM answer misclassifies KYC Review's responsibility, which should be ‘Responsible: Regulatory Liaison, Accountable: Operations Manager’. Instead, it only lists Regulatory Liaison as R (should be just R, with A noted).
    - Points are lost for failing to use “Consulted” at all in most rows (ground truth is explicit with C and I).

3. **Noncompliance with mandated activity wording:** 
   - The LLM answer renders some task names loosely (e.g., “Log transfer instruction in system” instead of “Receive Payment Instruction”), deviating from those in the ground truth, which strictly uses enacted terminology.
   - The “Notify Regulatory Liaison after archiving” row is not formatted as a process activity and is not present in the ground truth structure.

4. **Missing/Extra Steps:**
   - The ground truth includes all steps merged and normalized (e.g., “Archive Record” vs “Archive case file” and “Notify Regulatory Liaison…” as a discrete step — whereas the LLM answer splits or mislabels these).

5. **Formatting and structure:**
   - The ground truth has a clear legend and full mapping of every matrix cell. The LLM answer misses the legend and has a less explicit mapping.

**Summary:** Significant divergence from the ground truth and multiple important RACI errors or omissions, resulting in a score no higher than 4.0.
