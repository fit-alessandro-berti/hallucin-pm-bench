7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, and metrics)**: Perfect match. The three worst activities are correctly identified and ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120.0 h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44.0 h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4 h). All figures quoted verbatim from the table. No mention of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities. (+10 points baseline)
- **Structure and Constraints**: Memo format is crisp, professional, and under 150 words (~140). Ranks clearly and focuses solely on waiting times. No violations of prohibitions. However, it includes minor extraneous elements (e.g., subject line, closing signature, and a summary sentence on "efficiency and customer satisfaction") not present in the ground truth, slightly diluting crispness. (-1.0)
- **Recommendations**: Each is concrete and tied to waiting-time reduction, plausibly â‰¥20%. Logically relevant (e.g., automation for Request_Documents, parallel processing for Send_Closure_Letter, AI/staffing for Assess_Liability). However, significant differences from ground truth: Actions are speculative ("potentially", "likely", "aiming") without the data-driven backing (e.g., no "pilot tests", "estimated 30%", or "targeting 20-25%"). This makes them less "data-driven" per the prompt, a key requirement. (-1.5)

Overall, strong on core facts but penalized for action divergences and minor fluff under strict criteria.
