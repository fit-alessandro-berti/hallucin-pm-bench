**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies **No** with accurate counterexamples (C002 and C004 sequences match the log exactly), cites relevant CaseIDs, and disproves "always" via violations, fulfilling the task precisely. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all 4 cases (omits confirming C001/C003 hold, unlike ground truth table); (2) no tabular/quantified summary ("two out of four"); (3) slightly less structured format. No factual errors; highly meticulous overall.
