### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). Full points.
- **Question 2**: Exact match to ground truth (5.56%, including calculation). Full points.
- **Question 3**: Near-exact match; minor wording difference ("appears only in case A1002" vs. "Only case **A1002** contains"), but conveys the same information without deviation. Minor deduction for phrasing not aligning perfectly with bolding/underscore in ground truth.
- **Question 4**: Provides two sampling-related reasons that align broadly with ground truth options (small sample size and a form of bias/representativeness, touching on temporal and case-mix elements). However, lacks the specific depth and clarity of the ideal examples (e.g., no mention of variance/high variance, percentage point change, short time window details, high-risk segments, or survivorship bias; second reason is vague/general "may be biased" without concrete justification tied to the log). Significant deduction for not fully mirroring the "stated clearly" with ground-truth-level precision and detail, per strict evaluation criteria.
