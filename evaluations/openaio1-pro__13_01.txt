9.0

1. **Correctness of answers:**
   - Q1: "There is exactly 1 occurrence..." — Correct.
   - Q2: "That single occurrence represents 1/18 = 5.56%..." — Numerically correct and rounded.
   - Q3: "It appears only in case A1002." — Correct.
   - Q4: Both reasons are appropriate and align with ground truth: (a) Small sample size; (b) Sample may not be representative/possible bias. Slightly less specific than the ground-truth list, but both are valid and supported by the log.

2. **Strictness and minor deductions:**
   - For Q4, the wording "so the sample may be biased" is a bit general — the ground truth expects more specificity (e.g., temporal bias, case-mix bias, survivorship bias, etc.). The idea is correct, but it lacks explicit mention of the time window or how representativeness could be violated.
   - Q2 could perhaps cite the exact calculation as in the ground truth, but the calculation is still shown and correct.

**Summary:** All factual information is accurate and strictly drawn from the provided log lines, with only minimal loss of precision/specificity in the sampling-bias explanation.

**Point loss:** Only for the slight generality in Q4 versus the detailed bias types in ground truth.

**Final score:** 9.0
