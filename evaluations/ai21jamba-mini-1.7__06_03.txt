9.0

The LLM answer accurately identifies both parallel blocks in Process B and lists the tasks that can execute concurrently within each, matching the ground truth answer almost exactly. The numbering, order, and content are all correct. However, the LLM adds a final summarizing sentence ("These two sets of tasks can execute concurrently...") which, while correct, introduces minimal extra information compared to the required direct listing in the ground truth. The headings "Parallel Split #1" and "#2" are used instead of "Set 1" and "Set 2", and the separator is a comma instead of the â€– symbol. These are very minor deviations, but per the instruction to be strict and penalize small errors, this warrants a half-point reduction. Thus, the answer receives 9.0.
