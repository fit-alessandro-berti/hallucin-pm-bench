The LLM answer accurately identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets from Process B in the correct order, matching the core content of the ground truth without extraneous information about other processes. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., bullet-point format and labels like "Parallel Split #1" vs. ground truth's "Set 1 – first parallel block:" with inline ‖ notation; additional explanatory sentences not present in ground truth) and lack of the affirmative closing statement ("No other tasks..."), but no factual errors or omissions.
