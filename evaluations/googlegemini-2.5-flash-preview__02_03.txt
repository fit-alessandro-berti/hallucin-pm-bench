9.0

- The LLM answer gives the correct, concise, bullet-list format as required.
- All answers essentially match the ground truth in content:
    - "3 distinct cases" aligns with "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" (though ground truth is slightly more explicit by listing the names).
    - "Pack_Items" is a correct answer for both the ground truth and LLM response.
    - "Cancel_Order" is also correct and identical to the ground truth.
- However, points are lost for:
    - Not listing the case IDs for Q1, as the ground truth does.
    - Minor deviation in formatâ€”lack of bold or identifier for questions (A1, A2, A3).
- Strictness criterion: These omissions warrant a notable, though not dramatic, penalty. Thus, 9.0.
