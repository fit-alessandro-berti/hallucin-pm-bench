8.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the number of cases (3) though does not list the actual case IDs (C123, C456, C789) as in the ground truth. Listing the specific case IDs is a detail required for full correctness.
- The immediate predecessor to "Ship_Order" in case "C456" is correctly given as "Pack_Items."
- "Cancel_Order" is correctly identified as the activity that appears exactly once.

The main error is that in answer 1, the LLM gives only the number (3) instead of both the count and the corresponding case IDsâ€”this omission warrants a significant deduction per the strictness requested. Other answers are concise and correct, so the total deduction is moderate but significant: 8.0.
