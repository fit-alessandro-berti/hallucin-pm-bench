**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies core decision points (eligibility at triage, finance pre-approval, high-value branch >€1,000). Documents list is **complete and exact** match to ground truth (all 7 artefacts, no extras/inventions). Stays within defined process (no legacy activity). High-value logic accurate.
- **Penalties (significant deductions for differences)**:
  - **Extra decision point (#4 "Payment authorization gate")**: Not in ground truth (which merges final approval into #3 at pre-approve/auditor). This invents a non-agent "gate" as a decision, conflating **BankTransferAuthorization** (execution artefact) with approval precondition. Violates strict process description/constraints (no explicit decision there; deduct -1.0).
  - **Incorrect document assignments per point**: Introduces **RefundRequestForm** under triage (not explicitly listed; triage uses *FlightManifest*/*WeatherReport* only). Lists **BankTransferAuthorization** as "must-have" for invented gate (misplaced; it's for payment execution post-approvals). Ground truth separates docs entirely, no per-point breakdown (unasked, inaccurate; deduct -0.8).
  - **Missing branching/rejection logic**: No explicit outcomes like ground truth (e.g., "Not eligible → rejected", "Approved → payment; Rejected → ends"). Vague "decisions" without full logic (deduct -0.6).
  - **Minor issues**: No note on **AuditTrail** being high-value only (ground truth specifies). Extra unasked offer ("decision table or diagram"). Emojis/formatting diverge from ground truth table (style mismatch; deduct -0.4).
- **Overall**: Covers ~80% accurately but differences in decision count/content, doc placement, and omissions prevent higher score. Strict policy applied: small errors (extras/misplacements) = outsized loss.
