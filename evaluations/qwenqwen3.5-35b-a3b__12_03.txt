7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the answer as "No" and cites the two relevant counterexample cases (C002 and C004) with accurate sequences, sufficient to disprove the "always" claim. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major deduction (-1.5 points):** Factual phrasing error in C002 justification: "`Pack_Items` occurs between the payment validation and the order receipt." This reverses the order (it is between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*, not vice versa), introducing a false statement despite the correct sequence listing.
- **Minor deduction (-1.0 point):** Incomplete analysis; omits verification of compliant cases (C001, C003), unlike the exhaustive case-by-case table in ground truth. As a "meticulous process-mining analyst," full log coverage is expected.
- Structure and conciseness are good matches, but table format in ground truth provides clearer visualization.

Overall strong but penalized for sloppiness and incompleteness.
