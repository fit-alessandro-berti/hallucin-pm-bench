The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a valid counterexample from Case 1001 with accurate sequencing, but it is incomplete and flawed under strict evaluation: it ignores Case 1002 (where "Update_Inventory" is absent, directly falsifying the "always" claim) and Case 1003 (another reversal not cited), failing to comprehensively justify across all relevant data as required. This omission of key evidence results in a partial but insufficient analysis, warranting a significant deduction from a full score.
