**Score: 6.5**

**Rationale:**  
The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a concise justification, specifically citing Case 1001 and describing the actual sequence of activities. However, when evaluated with strictness and compared to the ground truth:

- **Misses Coverage:**  
  - The answer only references **Case 1001** and fails to mention **Cases 1002 and 1003**.
  - The ground truth shows that in Case 1002, `Update_Inventory` does not appear at all—a critical point since the claim includes “always.”  
  - In Case 1003, the LLM does not cite the sequence, missing another example where the claimed order is incorrect.

- **Level of Detail:**  
  - The LLM's explanation is less comprehensive than the ground truth, which methodically dispels the claim by examining each relevant case.
  - It omits the explicit statement that “in none of the three cases” does the ordering hold.

- **Terminological Precision:**  
  - The LLM does not state that the word “always” is already disproved by a single counterexample (e.g., lack of `Update_Inventory` in Case 1002).

**Summary:**  
The verdict is correct, and one strong counterexample is given—but the justification is incomplete and overlooks other relevant evidence present in the data. These omissions, especially regarding Case 1002, represent significant but not total deficiencies. Thus, a 6.5 is warranted for partial but insufficient justification.
