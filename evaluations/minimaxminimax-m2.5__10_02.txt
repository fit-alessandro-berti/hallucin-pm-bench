2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth):
- **Structural Mismatches (Major Deduction: -4.0)**: Missing entire "Operations Manager" column (present in all GT rows as key Accountable role). LLM uses only 3 columns vs. GT's 4. Extra row ("Notify Regulatory Liaison") not in GT. 8 tasks vs. GT's 6. Combined "R/A" notation invalid (GT always separates R/A distinctly).
- **Task Naming Errors (Major Deduction: -2.0)**: Inexact phrasing (e.g., "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. GT's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. plain "**KYC Review**"; "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" & "Archive case file" split unnecessarily vs. GT's consolidated "Release Payment" & "Archive Record"). No "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header.
- **RACI Assignments Wrong (Major Deduction: -1.5)**: Near-total divergence (e.g., KYC Review: LLM TA-R/RL-A vs. GT TA-C/RL-R/OM-A/IT-I; Approve: LLM RL-R/A/IT-C vs. GT TA-C/RL-R/OM-A/IT-I; Screen: LLM TA-R/RL-I vs. GT TA-R/RL-A/OM-I/IT-C). Ignores GT's OM-A dominance and IT involvements (C/I).
- **Extraneous Content (Minor but Significant: -0.5)**: Unrequested title "# RACI Matrix...", explanatory "Notes" section rehashing mappings (GT has concise notes post-table).
- **Partial Credits (+1.0)**: Markdown table format; correct mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"); covers source steps (no omissions, though distorted).

**Overall**: Fundamentally non-equivalent table; serves different process model. Unfit for strict documentation use.
