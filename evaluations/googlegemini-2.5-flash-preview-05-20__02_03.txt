9.0

- The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with all answers factually correct.
- The only (minor) deviation is that the ground truth gives specific case values for answer 1 ("C123, C456, C789"), whereas the LLM answer simply writes "3 distinct cases".
- For maximum strictness, this small omission (not listing the actual case values) requires the answer to lose a full point, as per the instructions.
- All other answers (A2 and A3) are perfectly correct, matching the ground truth wording.
- Therefore: 9.0
