**10.0**

The LLM answer is a near-perfect match to the ground truth across all questions, with no factual errors, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. All content derives strictly from the 18 log lines.

- Q1: Exact match ("1" occurrence/time).
- Q2: Exact match (5.56%, with correct calculation shown).
- Q3: Exact match (lists the sole case identifier "A1002"; conciseness aligns with "list" instruction, no need for extra phrasing).
- Q4: Provides exactly two clear, valid reasons directly from the ground truth options ("Temporal bias" and "Small sample size"), elaborated logically without adding unsupported data.
