The LLM answer is nearly identical in content and intent to the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility of computation due to the redacted event log (no rows or timestamps for calculations) and the insufficiency of Artifact B. It adheres to the task's requirements for a precise, short explanation without guessing. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., not explicitly mentioning "dispersion" for standard deviation or the need for "additional raw log entries") and a less direct opening ("I am unable to" vs. "Impossible"), but these are negligible under strict evaluation.
