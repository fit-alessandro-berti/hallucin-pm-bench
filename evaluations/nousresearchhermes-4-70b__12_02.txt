8.0

The LLM answer provides the correct verdict ("No") and correctly identifies C003 (lines 6 and 7) as a counter-example, stating that *Validate_Payment* occurs before *Receive_Order* in that case, directly contradicting the claim. However, the answer fails to mention another important counter-example: case C005 (lines 11-12) where *Validate_Payment* occurs and *Receive_Order* never appears at all. The omission of this evidence represents a significant miss, as full justification must reflect all counter-examples present to align with the ground truth. For this incomplete evidence, I deduct 2 points, resulting in a score of 8.0.
