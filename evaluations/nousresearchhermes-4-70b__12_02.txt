The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a accurate, concise justification citing the key counter-example in case C003 (lines 6-7), directly addressing the reversal of order and contradicting the "always follows" claim. However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits the additional counter-example in case C005 (line 11, with Validate_Payment but no Receive_Order), which the ground truth includes as a second clear violation, making the justification less comprehensive and failing to fully mirror the gold-standard's thoroughness in proving the negation across all relevant instances.
