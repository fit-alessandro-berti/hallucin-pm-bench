7.2

### Evaluation Notes (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same task (`Task_CollectEquipment`) and attribute (`camunda:dueDate`) as the ground truth. Diff is a valid single-hunk unified format targeting the breach-prone step. Rationale is one sentence, logical, and addresses SLA compliance on the critical path (close conceptual match).
- **Major deductions (-2.8 total)**:
  - Core diff content differs: `P1D` vs. ground truth `P2D` (specific value mismatch is a critical error under "utmost strictness"; alters the precise proposed improvement).
  - Rationale differences: Omits explicit "contractual 3-day SLA", "from 5 days to 2 days" phrasing, and "without introducing any new activities" (vague on SLA details; implies but doesn't match exactly).
- **Minor deductions (-0.5)**: Diff includes unnecessary file headers (`--- a/onboarding.bpmn +++ b/onboarding.bpmn`) not in ground truth's minimal single-hunk format; @@ lacks line numbers/context (malformed unified diff, though functional).
- Overall: High similarity in intent/strategy (80% match), but strict rules demand near-exact XML output and rationale phrasing for full score.
