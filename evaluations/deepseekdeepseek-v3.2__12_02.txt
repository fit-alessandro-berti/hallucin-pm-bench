10.0

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in identifying both counterexamples (C003 lines 6/7 and C005 line 11/no Receive_Order), correctly refuting the "always" claim with precise citations, and adheres strictly to the prompt's format ("No" followed by one paragraph). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., including accurate timestamps for emphasis, continuous prose vs. bullets) introduce no errors, inaccuracies, or deviations; extras enhance justification without violating instructions.
