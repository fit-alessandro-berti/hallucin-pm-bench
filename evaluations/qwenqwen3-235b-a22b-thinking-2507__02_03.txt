- The LLM answer is largely correct:
    - For Question 1, it says “3”, which—although accurate—is less complete and explicit than the ground truth answer which specifies the cases. Some strictness is warranted here for lack of detail, even though the literal value "3" is correct and unambiguous.
    - For Question 2 (“Pack_Items”) and Question 3 (“Cancel_Order”), both answers are perfectly accurate and match the reference.
- The main shortcoming is the lack of explicitly listing the cases for Question 1, as shown in the ground truth.
- Given utmost strictness and that even small errors should lose significant points, a 1-point deduction is warranted for this minor omission.

Final score: **9.0**
