The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, matching the ground truth on all substantive content: 3 distinct cases, "Pack_Items" for Q2, and "Cancel_Order" for Q3. The only minor difference is the lack of explicit labeling (e.g., "A1") and case listing in Q1, which is not required by the prompt's questions but present in the ground truthâ€”resulting in a small deduction for completeness under strict evaluation.
