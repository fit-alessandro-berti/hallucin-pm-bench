**10.0**

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in conclusion (cannot derive/compute the value), core reasoning (missing timestamps/elapsed-time data prevents duration/cycle time calculation), and adherence to the system instruction (clearly states the value cannot be derived, with explanation). Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed"; explicit benchmark dismissal, which is accurate and supportive; "cycle time" equated to "duration") add helpful detail without deviation or error. No fabrications, no numeric guesses, fully supported by data constraints.
