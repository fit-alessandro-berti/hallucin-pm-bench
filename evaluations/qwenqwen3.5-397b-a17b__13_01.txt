**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data for questions 1-3, with precise counting (1 occurrence in A1002), correct percentage (5.56%, matching calculation), and listing. For Q4, both reasons directly align with ground truth options ("small sample size" via 4 cases/high variance; "temporal bias" via single-day/short window), stated clearly without hallucination beyond what's permitted/used in ground truth examples. Minor formatting (e.g., % spacing, bolding, parentheticals) and phrasing variations (e.g., "approx five hours" vs. "morning") are stylistic, not substantive errors; no inferences beyond log-derived facts or standard sampling critique.
