5.0

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM identifies three decision points:
    1. Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome: Just computation of risk, not actually a decision/branch. (Mistakenly included as a gate.)
    2. Risk-rating conditional: Correctly identifies skip logic after risk check.
    3. "TriVote" gate: Correctly specifies “any two approvals out of three suffice to pass.”

- **Errors/Issues:**
    - The first (Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome) is not a decision gate or conditional branch, just an assessment. Including it is incorrect.
    - The "TriVote" explanation is correct.
    - The description for the skip logic is accurate but could be more precise ("if the risk is Low or Medium AND the amount is ≤ 250k, skip Manual-Underwriting-Review").

**b) Required Documents**

- The LLM lists the following in first-appearance order:  
    1. Form 14B  
    2. Scorecard–Cyan  
    3. Scorecard–Magenta  
    4. Scorecard–Yellow  
    5. Deck Memo  
    6. Offer Sheet 77  
    7. ID Matrix Declaration  
    8. Loan Dossier 2025  

- **Errors/Issues:**
    - **Omitted**: “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is required in the process (as shown in ground truth), but the LLM misses it.
    - “ID Matrix Declaration” is listed after “Offer Sheet 77,” but in the process, both are required together at the same step; including both in this order is acceptable.
    - No hallucinated documents.

**Summary of Deductions:**
- Major error: Listing a computation as a decision gate.
- Moderate error: Omitted a required document (Signed Offer Sheet 77).
- Minor error: Some ambiguity in summarization of decision logic.

**Final Score:** 5.0  
(The answer captures the major features but demonstrates substantive mistakes: the unnecessary inclusion of the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a decision point, and missing the Signed Offer Sheet 77 document. Each of these represents a significant deviation from the ground truth in a process evaluation.)
