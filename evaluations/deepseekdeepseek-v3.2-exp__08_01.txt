The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (answering "yes" as in ground truth), provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3 in a reachable marking, and offers a brief justification aligned with the inhibitor arc condition (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0 post-T2). This matches the prompt's requirements precisely.

Minor deductions for differences:  
- Lacks the ground truth's emphasis on T5 "must" fire before T3 (if it fires at all) due to permanent disablement post-T3, and the deeper explanation of p4's inhibitor implications (e.g., T4's joint removal).  
- Sequence is shorter (stops at T5 without showing subsequent T3/T4), making it less illustrative of the full behavior, though not required.  
- No explicit notation of markings post-T5 enabling T3 afterward, reducing completeness.  

No factual errors; high fidelity overall, with strictness applied to thoroughness gaps.
