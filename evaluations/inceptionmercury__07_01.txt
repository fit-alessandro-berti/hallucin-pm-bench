7.0

The LLM answer correctly identified the added and removed tasks along with the gateway type change, and used the required headings. However, several significant issues cause point deductions:

- The LLM did not use the exact required formatting or element names. For example, it wrote "check_vip" and "generate_qr" in code font, omitting the full descriptive "name" attribute present in the XML and the ground truth (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = check_vip)"). This is a notable omission since element names and ids are to be reported exactly as in the XML, per instructions.
- The gateway change was described only as “exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway,” not specifying the exact element (`gw_valid`) as required.
- It omitted the explicit ids and names pairing used in the ground truth.
- It did not use bold subheadings or the “(none)” placeholder for empty sections as shown in the ground truth and in the prompt’s rubric (though here, all sections had content).

While the core facts are captured and there’s no misinformation, strict adherence to instructions and precision in reporting exact element names were not met. Hence, a deduction to 7.0.
