7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies the exact factual differences: two tasks added (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), one task removed (`send_rma_label`), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive. Headings match the prompt's specified format (using â€¢ for headings). No speculation or extraneous content is added, adhering to the "only factual differences" rule.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Task listings use only IDs, omitting the full `name` attributes from the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" instead of just `check_vip`). Ground truth includes both names and IDs for clarity and completeness, making this a notable omission (-1.0 point).
  - Gateway change lacks the specific element ID (`gw_valid`) and version context (v1/v2), presenting it vaguely as "exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway." Ground truth explicitly ties it to the ID and versions (-1.0 point).
  - Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., - bullets vs. *; no bolding or backticks) deviate from ground truth's style, though not required by the prompt (-0.5 point).
- Overall, the response is factually accurate but insufficiently detailed and precise compared to ground truth, warranting a mid-high score under strict evaluation. No other differences (e.g., flows or events) are missed, avoiding further penalties.
