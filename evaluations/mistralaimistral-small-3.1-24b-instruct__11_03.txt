### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but deviates significantly in structure, precision, concreteness, and adherence to instructions, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Structure and Formatting (Major Deduction: -3.0)**: The prompt requires "only the memo text" with bullet points *exclusively* for recommendations, implying a cohesive prose body followed by a separate bulleted section. The LLM uses a numbered list integrating descriptions, quantifications, and recommendations, with sub-bullets for recs—violating the "only for recommendations" rule. Ground truth uses paragraph form for analysis and a distinct "**Recommended actions**" bulleted list. The LLM's header (e.g., "Memorandum," named "Vanessa Avery") invents details absent from the prompt/table, unlike the concise, data-grounded ground truth header.

- **Content Accuracy and Grounding (Moderate Deduction: -1.5)**: Correctly identifies the three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) and quantifies SLA excesses (300s, 300s, 60s) based on throughput vs. SLA, tying to high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). However, it omits explicit throughput values (e.g., ground truth specifies "900 s vs. 600 s SLA"), uses subjective qualifiers like "high"/"significant"/"moderate" without data support, and lacks grounding in total cases (ground truth derives "4 805 completed cases" from table data; LLM ignores). Sentences like "poses a significant bottleneck" and "compounding customer dissatisfaction" invent interpretations beyond provided metrics.

- **Recommendations (Major Deduction: -1.0)**: Must be "one concrete, data-driven action" per activity. LLM's are vague and non-specific (e.g., "engage a cross-functional team," "perform a detailed analysis," "implement predictive analytics") with no ties to table data (e.g., cases, times) or measurable outcomes. Ground truth provides precise, actionable steps (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks for low-risk," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k") implied to be data-derived, plus a projection (35% cycle time reduction) absent in LLM.

- **Overall Compliance (Minor Deduction: -0.3)**: ≈150 words (LLM ~180, close but wordy due to structure). No extraneous activities/metrics, but lacks ground truth's holistic closing (SLA restoration projection) and data-driven summary (e.g., "materially breach... largest queues"). Invents non-table elements (COO name, interpretive phrases), breaching "ground every sentence in the data; do NOT invent."

The core identification and quantification earn baseline credit, but cumulative errors in strictness criteria (structure, invention, rec quality) prevent a passing score above 5.0.
