7.8

Rationale:

- **R1:** Correct status and justification.
- **R2:** Status and reasoning incorrect. The LLM answer incorrectly takes the last approval before the Change_Request ("final approval on March 4"). According to R5, a new Manager_Approval is required—so Ship_Goods on March 5 is before the *required* final approval (which is on March 7), not after. Thus, the justification is incorrect, though the status (Violated) is correct. (It was actually >2 days after the *new required approval*, not after the old one.)
- **R3:** Correct status and justification.
- **R4:** Correct status and justification.
- **R5:** Status and justification are close, but not precise: LLM says “goods were shipped before obtaining new approval” (which is true) but omits that also Pay_Invoice occurred before new approval (which is required by the ground truth). Not strictly incorrect, but incomplete for maximal credit.
- **R6:** Correct.

**Main issues:**  
- The key error in R2’s justification shows the LLM did not fully integrate the dependency between R5 and R2—resulting in a significant accuracy loss.
- Slight incompleteness in R5’s justification.
- Some justifications exceed 20 words (R2 = 21, R5 = 22). This is a minor point but per "utmost strictness," it matters.

**Summary:**  
All rule statuses are correct. The justifications for R2 and R5 are not fully aligned with the ground truth and show process gaps, mainly by not updating "last required approval" after the Change_Request and omitting Pay_Invoice in R5. The provided justifications are also sometimes a word or two too long. Down-rated accordingly with strictness.
