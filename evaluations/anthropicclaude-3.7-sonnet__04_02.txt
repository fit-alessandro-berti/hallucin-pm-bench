### Evaluation Breakdown
The LLM answer correctly identifies all rule statuses (Compliant, Violated, Not Applicable) matching the ground truth, and the overall result is identical (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are concise (all ≤20 words) and follow the required format without a table, aligning with the prompt's instructions. However, strict evaluation reveals key differences:

- **R1, R3, R4, R6**: Justifications are nearly identical in meaning and accuracy, with minor phrasing variations (negligible differences).
- **R2**: Significant error in justification. The LLM incorrectly treats the Finance_Approval on 03-04 as the "final approval," ignoring the Change_Request's impact (per R5), which requires a new Manager_Approval on 03-07 as the last required approval. This misidentifies the timeline for the 2-day window, leading to flawed reasoning despite the correct "Violated" status. Ground truth correctly ties it to the post-change approval.
- **R5**: Minor difference—LLM focuses only on "goods were shipped" (i.e., Ship_Goods), while ground truth includes both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice as "further processing steps" before the new approval. This omits part of the violation scope.

Under utmost strictness, the R2 factual/logical error in justification (core to rule compliance analysis) warrants a substantial deduction, as it shows incomplete integration of rules R2 and R5. R5's partial omission is a smaller but notable flaw. No other format or length issues. Overall, strong alignment on outcomes but penalized for reasoning gaps.
