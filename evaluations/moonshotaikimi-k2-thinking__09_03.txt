The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in identifying the core issue (redacted data in Artefact A prevents computation of cycle times, average, SD, and CI due to absent timestamps). It correctly explains the precise reason without guessing or external knowledge, maintaining a short paragraph format as required. Minor deductions for slight differences in phrasing (e.g., more explicit mention of SLA's irrelevance, which is factually correct but not in the ground truth, and not explicitly stating the need for "additional raw log entries"), resulting in a very high but not perfect score under strict evaluation.
