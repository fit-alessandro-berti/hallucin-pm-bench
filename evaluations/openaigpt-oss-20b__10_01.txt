4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Positive, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This matches the ground truth and policy perfectly.
- **Structure and Format (Partial, +1.0 point)**: The matrix includes all 6 required activities as rows and the 4 roles as columns, with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced (complies with "unwarranted content" note). Markdown table format is used appropriately. However, column headers use abbreviations (e.g., "AM"), while ground truth uses full names (e.g., "Account Manager"). The added title and legend for R/A/C/I are unwarranted extras not present in ground truth, and formatting lacks bolding/emphasis on key assignments.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, -6.0 points total, strict deduction)**: This is the core content and shows substantial differences from ground truth, violating the "reflect the narrative" criterion (exactly one Responsible per activity; Account Manager Accountable where appropriate). Deductions are strict per small/medium errors as instructed:
  - **Primary Responsibles (Mostly correct, minor deductions)**: Matches ground truth for all 6 activities (e.g., AM for Receive/Order Vetting/Notify; CO for KYC; FC for Payment; IT for Record). However, combines R/A inappropriately for KYC (CO as R/A vs. separate R only), Payment (FC as R/A vs. R only), and Record (IT as R/A vs. R only), ignoring ground truth's separation of A where applicable (-0.5 per, total -1.5).
  - **Accountabilities (Significant errors)**: Fails to assign A to Account Manager for KYC and Payment Clearance (where ground truth explicitly does), incorrectly implying CO/FC own outcomes (+1.5 error). Adds unwarranted A to IT for Record Update (no A in ground truth, implying broader ownership by AM or none) (-0.5). Matches for Receive/Order Vetting/Notify (-1.0 total deduction).
  - **Consulted (C) and Informed (I) Assignments (Major errors)**: Completely misses all C assignments (5 instances in ground truth: CO for Receive/Order Vetting/Payment; FC for KYC/Record; AM for Record), defaulting to I everywhere non-primary. This ignores narrative implications (e.g., CO needs input for KYC after Receive; compliance input for Order Vetting/Payment). Treats consultations as mere notifications, distorting process flow (-3.0 deduction, as these are critical nuances reflecting interactions).
  - Each activity has exactly one R (complies with note), but overall allocations do not "reflect the narrative" as in ground truth (e.g., AM oversight role diminished).
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: With utmost strictness, the RACI mismatches (13+ cell differences out of 24, plus structural extras) outweigh basics, as they fundamentally alter responsibility flow. No self-awareness issues (N/A). Total nets to 4.0: credit for skeleton and terms, heavy penalty for core inaccuracies.
