8.0

**Justification:**

- **Vocabulary compliance (most crucial):** The LLM answer *fully respects* the strict vocabulary rules: it uses “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” exactly as required, with correct spelling and capitalization. None of the forbidden expressions appear at all.
- **Columns/roles:** Correct roles are listed, and columns — both the short abbreviation and the long name — are provided. This doesn’t penalize as the mappings are clear and explicit.
- **Rows/activities:** The activities use the prescribed terms and correct order. No extra or missing activities.
- **RACI allocations:**
  - Minor but important discrepancies:
    - LLM marks **KYC Review** as “R/A” for the Compliance Officer, but the ground truth splits “A” (Accountable) to CO, *and* marks Account Manager as “A”. LLM omits “C” (Consulted) for Finance Clerk for KYC Review.
    - LLM marks all “I” (Informed) for non-key roles in every row; ground truth is more nuanced (e.g., “C” for Finance Clerk on Receive Application and KYC Review, “C” for Account Manager and Finance Clerk on Record Update, “C” for Compliance Officer on Order Vetting and Payment Clearance).
    - “Order Vetting” and “Notify Customer” are correct for Account Manager, but LLM always marks non-central roles as “I” rather than following the ground truth’s differentiation between “C”, “I”, or “A”.
    - For “Payment Clearance,” ground truth has “A” for Account Manager (LLM has only “I”), “C” for Compliance Officer, “R” for Finance Clerk (LLM has “R/A”), and “I” for IT Support.
    - For “Record Update,” ground truth is “C” for Account Manager and Finance Clerk, and “R” for IT; LLM gives “I” everywhere but “R/A” for IT. So “C” assignments are dropped.
    - For “Notify Customer,” both match.
  - In LLM, “R/A” is always on a single role; ground truth sometimes splits them, and often assigns “C” in parallel.

- **Format:** LLM formats the matrix in markdown as requested, includes a legend for R, A, C, I which is fine.

**Deductions:**
- The key loss of points is for the lack of accuracy in RACI role distribution, especially omitting “C” roles and not splitting “R” and “A” assignments between different roles when the ground truth does (e.g., for KYC Review and Payment Clearance). This is a significant, if common, failing, as proper assignment of “C” or “A” distinguishes nuanced responsibility.
- These are not minor flaws: “Consulted” and “Accountable” are absent or conflated with “Responsible” far too often.

**Summary:** While the terminology policy is followed perfectly and activity naming is impeccable, the RACI allocations show significant simplification and do not capture the subtler distinctions shown in the ground truth. Hence, 8.0: correct in all visible respects except the most important part of process mapping — proper responsibility assignments.
