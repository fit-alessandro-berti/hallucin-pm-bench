### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact matches to the ground truth in terms of content: three tasks added (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), one task removed (Task_ManualReview), and two gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel; Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel). No extraneous elements, guesses, or commentary are included, adhering to the prompt's core instructions.

However, under utmost strictness, minor formatting deviations result in point deductions:
- Headings are prefixed with "-" in the LLM answer but not in the ground truth (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS" vs. "ADDED TASKS"), inverting the list structure.
- Items under headings lack the "-" bullet points present in the ground truth (e.g., "Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)" vs. "- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)").
- The second gateway change lacks alignment spacing after the colon (e.g., "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").

These small inconsistencies in list and alignment formatting, while not altering meaning, warrant a significant deduction (1.8 points total) for failing to mirror the ground truth's exact presentation style.
