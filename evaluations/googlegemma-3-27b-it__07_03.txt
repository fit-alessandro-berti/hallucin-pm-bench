The LLM answer contains all correct content regarding differences, citing the proper tasks and gateway changes. However, significant formatting errors are present:

- The headings are not presented verbatim as required by the prompt (they use a leading dash and extra spaces).
- Task and gateway entries under each heading lack the required hyphen "-" at the start of each item.
- The gateway change lines omit the required alignment under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES (the ground truth includes formatting such as extra spaces after the colon in the second gateway).
- The listing format is markdown-flavored, not plain as required, and not strictly matching the ground truth.

These formatting mistakes are significant, as fidelity to formatting and heading structure is part of the specification and not following them precisely detracts considerably from the score. Content accuracy is high, but this does not compensate for the prompt violations.
