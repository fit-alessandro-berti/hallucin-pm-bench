### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major partial credit, but significant deductions for omissions and incompleteness):** The LLM correctly identifies and describes two of the three ground truth decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision), using exact terminology without introducing standard loan terms. However, it omits the third point entirely (Final Micro-loan Board Approval as a standalone decision where the board votes approve or reject), treating it instead as a mere extension of the second point. It also fails to specify process positions (e.g., "after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which are explicit in the ground truth. This incompleteness and lack of precision warrant a substantial deduction (~2-3 points loss from a potential 10).
  
- **Required Documents (minor credit, but deductions for wording variances and extras):** The LLM lists all six required documents accurately in content and uses exact names. However, it introduces small but non-matching phrasing from the ground truth: "≤ 3 months old" (vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"), "single pay-stub or tax slip" (vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"), and "CIS) template" (vs. "CIS"). It also uses bullet points instead of numbering and omits the ground truth's explanatory note ("No credit bureau report..."). Per strict evaluation, these variances (even small) reflect significant point loss (~1 point deduction).

Overall, the response is mostly faithful but undermined by the key omission in decision points and minor fidelity issues, preventing a higher score. No criminal or jailbreak issues apply here.
