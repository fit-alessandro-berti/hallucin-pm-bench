The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top 3 activities by average waiting time (#1 Request_Documents 36.5/120.0h, #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0h, #3 Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4h), quotes figures verbatim, avoids non-waiting metrics/other activities, and stays under 150 words (~140). Format is a valid crisp memo.

Deductions (-2.0 total):
- Actions are concrete/logically relevant but not "data-driven" (no pilots, estimates, or data citations justifying ≥20% cut per action, unlike ground truth's specifics like "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%").
- Stylistic differences vs. ground truth (formal headers/summary vs. ultra-concise #1-#3 list; normalized names "Request Documents" vs. exact "Request_Documents"; "hours" vs. "h"/"p95"; general phrasing vs. precise details like "24 h escalation triggers").
Strict criteria penalize these as significant gaps in matching ground truth's precision and data-driven claims.
