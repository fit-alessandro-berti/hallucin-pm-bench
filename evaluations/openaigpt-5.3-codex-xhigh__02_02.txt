**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all questions with no errors, omissions, additions of incorrect information, or hallucinations:
- Q1: Correct count of 3; the parenthetical list of cases is accurate and directly derivable from the log (no fabrication).
- Q2: Exact sequence matching ground truth (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order), verified against log lines 2,5,8,10.
- Q3: Exact distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery for C002, Check_Stock for C001/C003), correctly listed one per line and alphabetically ordered (A before C), matching prompt instruction and ground truth content.

Minor formatting differences (headers, bolding, lack of "-" bullets vs. ground truth's <br>- style) do not constitute errors under strict factual/content precision, as the prompt specifies content requirements (e.g., "one per line" met, sequence with "→", alphabetical), not rigid styling. No point loss applied.
