3.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Format and Structure (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: The ground truth uses a standard RACI matrix with tasks in rows and roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) as columns, populated with single letters (R, A, C, I). The LLM answer inverts this to RACI categories as columns and populates with full role names (e.g., "Transaction Analyst" in multiple cells), which is a valid alternative RACI format but fundamentally mismatches the ground truth's layout. This is a significant structural deviation, not a minor variation.
  
- **Roles Used (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM correctly mandates "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", and "IT Support" (from the source text), but omits "Operations Manager", which is central in the ground truth as the primary Accountable role across all tasks. This results in incomplete role coverage and inaccurate delegation of accountability (e.g., LLM often assigns A to the Responsible party, like Transaction Analyst for Task 1, ignoring the ground truth's Operations Manager A).

- **Task Coverage and Wording (Moderate Deduction: -1.0 points)**: The LLM covers all source steps but expands to 7 tasks (e.g., combines release/SWIFT in one row but adds a separate "7. Notifies..." row for the notification in step 6, which the ground truth integrates implicitly into "Archive Record" via I for Regulatory Liaison). Task phrasings differ: LLM retains verbose source-like descriptions (e.g., "Receives customer’s transfer instruction and logs it in the system"), while ground truth uses concise, mandated-aligned titles (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction"). No omissions, but the extra row and wording mismatches reduce alignment.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.5 points)**: Assignments diverge substantially per task, even where roles overlap:
  - Task 1 (Receive): LLM (TA R/A, RL C) vs. GT (TA R, Op M A, IT C, RL I) – Misses IT C and RL I; incorrectly combines R/A.
  - Task 2 (Screen): LLM (TA R/A, RL C) vs. GT (TA R, RL A, Op M I, IT C) – Misses IT C and Op M I; wrong A.
  - Task 3 (KYC): LLM (RL R/A, TA C) vs. GT (TA C, RL R, Op M A, IT I) – Partial match on R and TA C, but misses IT I and assigns A incorrectly to RL.
  - Task 4 (Approve): Similar partials but misses Op M A and IT I; LLM adds unnecessary TA C.
  - Task 5 (Release): LLM (TA R, IT A, RL C) vs. GT (TA R, RL I, Op M A, IT C) – Swaps IT/RL roles and A assignment.
  - Task 6 (Archive): LLM (IT R/A, RL C + extra notify row with RL I) vs. GT (TA C, RL I, Op M A, IT R) – Misses TA C; extra row disrupts 1:1 mapping; incorrect A.
  These inconsistencies (e.g., frequent R/A merging, ignored Consulted/Informed in places) indicate flawed RACI logic relative to ground truth.

- **Vocabulary Mandate (No Deduction: +1.0 point)**: LLM strictly uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst" without deviations (e.g., no "CDD" or "clerk"). Matches ground truth here, including "IT Support".

- **Additional Elements (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: LLM includes explanatory notes on mandated terms and RACI logic, which are helpful but absent in the ground truth (which only has a brief legend and note). The prompt doesn't require notes, so this adds unrequested content. Table is in clean Markdown.

Overall, while the LLM produces a functional RACI table with enforced vocabulary, the core mismatches in format, roles, task structure, and assignments (especially accountability) result in a low score under strict criteria. It captures ~40-50% alignment, warranting a 3.5.
