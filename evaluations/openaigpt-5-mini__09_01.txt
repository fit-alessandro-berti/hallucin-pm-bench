The LLM answer accurately identifies that the average cycle time cannot be computed due to redacted timestamps and elapsed times, aligning closely with the ground truth's core assertion of missing temporal data. It correctly explains the data limitation and briefly describes the required calculation method, fulfilling the prompt's request for an explanation without fabricating a numeric value. Minor deduction for not explicitly mentioning "ordering information" or the risk of fabrication, which adds slight nuance in the ground truth but does not alter the overall validity.
