The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in content, correctly identifying "No" compliance due to the Rule 3 violation while affirming the other rules. Justification covers all rules with precise reasoning matching the trace and severity. Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., explicit "once each" for both QE/RA in LLM vs. implied in ground truth for RA) and format differences (bullets vs. table), per strict evaluation criteria.
