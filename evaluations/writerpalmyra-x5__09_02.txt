The LLM answer is highly accurate in conveying the core reasoning (lack of timestamps preventing cycle time calculation) and adheres to the concise sentence format, but loses points for minor phrasing divergences from the ground truth: less precise terminology ("cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "time-related information necessary to calculate durations" vs. explicit mention of "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals absent"), no em-dashes for structure, and slightly less emphasis on the absence of intervals despite identical intent.
