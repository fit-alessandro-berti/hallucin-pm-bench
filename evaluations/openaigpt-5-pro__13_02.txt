The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match precisely, including calculations and rounding to two decimals. Question 3 adheres to â‰¤100 words (68 words), addresses the single-occurrence issue, notes instability/non-robustness in estimates (e.g., durations, probabilities, overfitting, spurious importance), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., misestimating bottlenecks, frequencies, impacts), aligning with ground truth requirements without invention or deviation. No errors or omissions.
