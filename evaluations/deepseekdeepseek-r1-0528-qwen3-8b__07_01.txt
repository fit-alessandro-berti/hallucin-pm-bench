7.0

The LLM answer captures all the factual changes but loses significant points for the following strictness issues:

- **IDs omitted in tasks:** The element names/IDs (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`, and `send_rma_label`) are not included as required; only the task names are given. The prompt and the ground truth explicitly demand use of the element names as in the XML.
- **Gateway type changes presentation:** The answer names the element (`gw_valid`) but presents the gateway types with a full reference (`exclusiveGateway (RMA_v1.gw_valid)`), which is less clear and not exactly matching the ground truth format (“gw_valid changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)”).
- **Formatting:** The use of hyphens or bullet points is acceptable, but the explicit requirement is to use the element names as they appear in the XML, which includes both `id` and `name` for tasks, and that’s not shown by the LLM.
- **Extra precision:** The ground truth lists both the name and the id for the tasks, and the LLM omits the ids, which is a notable omission based on the instructions.

Otherwise, there are no hallucinations, missing differences, or grouping errors, so a score of 7.0 reflects precise but not perfect compliance due to these lapses.
