10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match in factual accuracy, structure, and key citations to the ground truth, correctly identifying the "No" verdict and the same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 lines 11-12) with precise explanations of why they disprove the "always follows" claim. Minor elaborations (e.g., noting successful follows in other cases or intermediate activities in C002) are accurate supplements that do not introduce errors or deviate from the required one-paragraph justification citing lines/cases, maintaining full alignment under strict evaluation.
