8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of computing the required metrics due to the redacted event log, precisely citing the absence of timestamps and event rows from Artefact A, and linking this to the inability to calculate cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval. It adheres to the task's instruction against guessing or using outside knowledge. However, deductions are applied for: (1) use of markdown headings (# and ##), which deviates from "plain text" response format; (2) inclusion of extraneous details about Artefact B's historical metric (accurate but unnecessary for the "precisely why" explanation); and (3) the additional meta-sentence on AI limitations, making it less concise than the ground truth's single short paragraph. These stylistic and content additions, while minor, warrant a strict reduction from a perfect score.
