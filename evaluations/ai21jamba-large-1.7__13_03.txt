7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1 (Score: 10.0)**: Exact match to ground truth; correctly identifies one occurrence with specific reference to CaseID 1002.
- **Part 2 (Score: 4.4)**: Word count compliant (â‰ˆ90 words). Covers small sample size and sampling bias generically, aligning partially with ground truth's emphasis on limited data leading to unreliable estimates. However, significant omissions include: no quantification of sample (e.g., 14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), no mention of frequency volatility (0% to 7% swing), no discussion of confidence intervals or rare-event sampling error, and critically, no reference to near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing distortion via strict/fuzzy matching. These gaps represent major differences in depth and precision, resulting in substantial point loss per strict criteria.
- **Overall**: Weighted average (equal parts), penalized for incomplete alignment despite no factual errors.
