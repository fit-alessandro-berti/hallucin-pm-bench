6.5

**Justification:**

a) **Decision points**
- The LLM’s answer correctly identifies the two main decision points and describes their rules clearly. However, the wording for the TriVote gate is slightly less precise: “sufficient to pass this gate” is a minor imprecision compared to “the loan may advance only when at least two of the three approvers…record ‘Approve’.” Still, both points are present and mostly clear.

b) **Required documents**
- The LLM incorrectly lists “ID Matrix Declaration” *before* “Signed Offer Sheet 77.” In the process, the signed offer comes first, then the ID Matrix. 
- Critically, the LLM omits “Signed Offer Sheet 77” as a separate document. The signed version is a required artefact, distinct from the unsigned original ("Offer Sheet 77") and must appear in the document list as per the ground truth answer. This is a significant omission.
- Otherwise, the order and inclusion of documents that are listed are correct.

**Deductions:**
- Omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate document: -1.5 points (major process compliance error)
- Incorrect order (“ID Matrix Declaration” before signed offer): -1.0 point
- Slight imprecision in decision-point wording and lack of full clarity in “TriVote” description: -1.0 point

**Final score:** 6.5/10.0  
Summary: Mostly captures the process logic, but inaccuracies in required documentation incur significant point deductions.
