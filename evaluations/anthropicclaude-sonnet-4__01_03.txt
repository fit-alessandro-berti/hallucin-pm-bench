7.5

### Explanation of Evaluation
I evaluated the LLM answer with utmost strictness against the ground truth, focusing on factual accuracy, completeness, phrasing, and adherence to the prompt. Differences, even minor, result in point deductions. The score is an overall assessment balancing both parts (a and b), weighted equally.

#### Part (a): Decision Points (8.5/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly identifies both decision points (the risk-based skip and TriVote gate). Substantively captures the rules: risk condition matches (Low/Medium + amount ≤ €250,000 skips step 5), and TriVote rule aligns with "any two approvals out of three suffice."
- **Errors/Deductions**:
  - Minor phrasing mismatches: Uses "€250,000 or less" vs. ground truth's "≤ €250 000" (formatting nitpick, but strictness deducts slightly). Omits the explicit "otherwise proceeds to review" clause for completeness (-0.5).
  - TriVote phrasing is close but less precise: Says "sufficient to pass this gate" without ground truth's "only when at least two... record 'Approve'" (misses the approval verbiage and conditional advancement; -1.0). References "Step 4" and "Step 6" (unnecessary per prompt's "summarise every decision point," adding extraneous detail; -0.5).
- No hallucinations or missed points; near-perfect but not identical.

#### Part (b): Documents List (6.5/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly lists most documents (Form 14B, all three Scorecards, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025) in proper first-appearance order up to step 7. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions). Scorecards are appropriately separated.
- **Errors/Deductions**:
  - Incomplete list: Misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (first appears in step 8, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7). Ground truth treats the signed version as a unique entry, making the list 9 items vs. LLM's 8 (-2.0 for omission).
  - Order disruption: By not listing "Signed Offer Sheet 77" separately, the subsequent items (ID Matrix Declaration and Loan Dossier 2025) shift incorrectly (e.g., ID becomes #7 instead of #8; -1.0).
  - Extraneous additions: Includes step numbers in parentheses (e.g., "(step 1)"), which ground truth omits for a clean list per the prompt's "list... in the order they first appear" (-0.5).
- Significant incompleteness affects the entire list's utility.

**Overall Score Rationale**: Part (a) is strong but not flawless; part (b) has a clear structural error (missing item leading to incomplete/inaccurate ordering). Strictness penalizes the omissions and extras heavily, but no major fabrications keep it from lower scores. Average of parts yields 7.5.
