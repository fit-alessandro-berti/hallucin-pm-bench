**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) (Decision points)**: Near-perfect match. Both identify exactly the two decision points with accurate rules. LLM's phrasing is concise and faithful to the process description ("if... then skip"), while ground truth adds "otherwise it proceeds" for explicitness (minor completeness difference, -0.2). LLM includes helpful step references (not in ground truth, neutral). TriVote rule identical in substance ("at least two... approve" vs. "at least two... record 'Approve'"). Currency formatting (€250,000 comma vs. €250 000 space, per process; small style nit, -0.1). One-sentence rule descriptions met strictly.
- **Part b) (Documents)**: **Identical** list in exact order, no omissions/additions/hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML). Minor formatting diff (LLM bolds each item, ground does not; neutral/insignificant).
- **Overall**: Extremely high fidelity (99% match), no factual errors/misinterpretations. Strict deductions only for tiny phrasing/typo variances; still exceptional under "utmost strictness."
