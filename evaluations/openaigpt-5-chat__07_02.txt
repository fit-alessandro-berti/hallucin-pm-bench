7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: three added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), one removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive. No extraneous changes are included, and it adheres to the required headings without mentioning ignored cosmetics (e.g., name changes). However, under utmost strictness:

- **Formatting and structure differences (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: Uses bullet points instead of numbered lists; headings lack the exact styling (e.g., ground truth uses italics/asterisks and bold for names). This deviates from the ground truth's precise layout.
- **Presentation order (moderate deduction: -0.5 points)**: Lists IDs before names (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity` — *Verify Identity*), reversing the ground truth's name-first approach (**Name** (`ID`)).
- **Gateway detail omission (moderate deduction: -0.5 points)**: States "Exclusive Gateway → Inclusive Gateway" but omits explanatory terms (XOR/OR) and version references (*v1* to *v2*), reducing precision.
- **Missing note (minor deduction: -0.25 points)**: Lacks the ground truth's closing assurance "(No other additions, removals, or gateway-type changes are present.)", which confirms completeness.

Content accuracy is high (9/10), but cumulative stylistic and detail differences warrant the score.
