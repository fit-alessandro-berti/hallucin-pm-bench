The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth. It correctly:

- Lists all three added tasks, matching the ground truth exactly in both order and description.
- Identifies the one removed task, precisely mirroring the ground truth.
- Captures the gateway-type change (exclusive → inclusive) and specifies the correct element.

Minor very strict deductions:
- In the "Gateway-type changes," the LLM answer does not explicitly mention the change is from XOR (exclusive) to OR (inclusive) as in the ground truth's parenthetical clarification, though this is a trivial omission.
- The LLM does not repeat that "No other additions, removals, or gateway-type changes are present," as the ground-truth summary does, but this is not strictly required by the prompt.
- The LLM answer orders the name and IDs in task changes as "ID — Name" rather than the reverse, but per the prompt, this presentation difference is not a cause for major deduction.

All information present is correct, complete, and grouped exactly as instructed. Only a minor deduction for strictness on slight elaboration differences and lack of one clarification.
