10.0

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in conclusion (No) and justification (correctly identifies violations in C002 and C004 with accurate sequences, while noting compliance in C001 and C003). It fulfills the task requirements by answering Yes/No and citing relevant CaseIDs/sequences. Differences are purely stylistic (narrative steps vs. table format; minor verbosity), with no errors or inaccuracies, warranting full marks under strict evaluation.
