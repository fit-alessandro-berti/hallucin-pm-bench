9.0

The LLM answer accurately identifies all relevant changes: the three added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), the one removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway-type change from exclusive to inclusive. Core content matches the ground truth precisely, with no factual errors or omissions, and ignores non-relevant aspects like renamings (e.g., task names, gateway name) as instructed. However, minor deductions for: (1) formatting differences (bullet points and ID-first presentation vs. ground truth's numbered lists, bold names, and backticked IDs); (2) extra unnecessary details in the gateway section (branch counts, which go beyond just the type change); and (3) lack of the ground truth's closing note confirming no other changes. These are small presentation/precision issues under strict evaluation, warranting a slight point loss from a perfect score.
