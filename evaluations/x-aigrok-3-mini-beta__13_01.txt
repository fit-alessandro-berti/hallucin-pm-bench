10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the provided log data without any inferences or hallucinations. It correctly answers all four questions:

- Q1 matches the ground truth exactly (1 occurrence).
- Q2 matches precisely, including the calculation and rounding to 5.56%.
- Q3 matches, identifying only A1002.
- Q4 provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons that align with the ground truth examples (small sample size and temporal bias from the single-day coverage).

No deviations, errors, or additions beyond the log fragment are present, justifying a maximum score under strict evaluation criteria.
