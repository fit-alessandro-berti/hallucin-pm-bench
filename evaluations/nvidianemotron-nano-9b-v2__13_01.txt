9.0

1. The answer to question 1 (“1”) is exact and correct.
2. The answer to question 2 (“5.56%”) is correct and precise to two decimals.
3. The answer to question 3 (“A1002”) is accurate and matches the ground truth.
4. The answer to question 4 provides two sampling-related reasons:
   - “The sample size is too small (only 1 occurrence in 18 events), making it unrepresentative of the population.” This is correct and matches the ground truth (“Small sample size…high variance…”).
   - “The fragment covers only a single day, which may not reflect monthly variability (e.g., fraud checks could spike or drop seasonally).” This is acceptable and maps to “Temporal bias—the snippet covers only a short time window…may show different fraud-check volumes”.

Small deduction:
- Reason 2 for Q4 does phrase the issue as “a single day…seasonal spikes or drops,” which borders on a slight generalization (potentially overstating variability like “seasonally” not shown in the data fragment) rather than strictly “short time window / day,” but it’s reasonable. However, the answer could have been further precise by specifying “only the morning of 2025-05-01,” as in the ground truth.
- The model didn’t use phrases like “case-mix bias” or “survivorship bias,” but only 2 reasons were required and stated clearly.

Thus, 9.0: The answers are complete, concise, and strictly adhere to the prompt with only a very minor flexibility in Q4 wording.
