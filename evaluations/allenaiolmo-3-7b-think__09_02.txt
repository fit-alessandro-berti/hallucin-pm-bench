The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth: both correctly identify that the average cycle time cannot be computed due to the absence of timestamps (or equivalent duration data), are equally concise single sentences, directly address the activity name, and use only the provided information without extraneous details or errors. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "timestamps or durations for individual activity cycles" vs. "timestamps or duration information... start-to-completion intervals") do not alter meaning, precision, or completeness under even strict evaluation.
