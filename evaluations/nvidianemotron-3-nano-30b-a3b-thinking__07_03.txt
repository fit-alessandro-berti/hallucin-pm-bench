The LLM answer correctly identifies all verifiable functional changes: 3 added tasks, 1 removed task, and 2 gateway type changes, with exact IDs, names, and type transitions matching the XML diffs and prompt specifications. No extras, guesses, or commentary added. However, under utmost strictness:

- Missing "-" bullet prefix before every item (7 instances: 3 added, 1 removed, 2 gateways), altering every content line from the ground truth.
- Lacks column alignment spaces in the second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").

These are small formatting discrepancies but warrant significant deduction per instructions (~2.0 points total), despite perfect content accuracy.
