2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Major factual errors (severe deduction)**: First parallel set incorrectly lists only `Quality_Check` and falsely claims it parallels "any task after receive event" instead of specifically `Quality_Check ‖ Update_Inventory` (-4.0). Invents nonsensical **Set 3** (`Notify_Procurement` alone, duplicating Set 2) (-2.0).
- **Partial correctness**: Identifies second parallel correctly as `Generate_Replenishment_Report` and `Notify_Procurement` (+1.0); notes the two splits (+1.0).
- **Structural/Format deviations**: Unrequested intro fluff ("Based on the descriptions..."); doesn't use ground truth's precise "Set X – [block name]" numbering with ‖; no "No other tasks" disclaimer (-1.0).
- **Overall**: ~80% deviation from ground truth content/structure; fails core task of listing *sets of concurrent tasks on same construct*. Strict policy demands significant loss for errors.
