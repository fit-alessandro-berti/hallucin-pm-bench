9.5

The LLM answer is factually perfect, matching the ground truth content exactly on all three questions (distinct cases count/list, preceding activity for C456, and unique activity). Minor deductions for:
- Slightly less concise phrasing (e.g., restating questions in Q2/Q3 labels vs. ground truth's direct answers).
- Formatting variances (e.g., "1./2./3." vs. "A1/A2/A3", extra bolding on case names, "before" vs. "precedes", no escaped "\_" in activity names).
- Bullet style ("-" vs. "*") and lack of "Expected answer" header (negligible).

No factual errors or major deviations; strict grading still yields near-perfect score.
