8.0

The LLM answer is largely correct but not fully compliant with the requirements for strictness and detail:

- It omits task and gateway element IDs. The instructions require using element names *exactly as they appear in the XML*, which includes the IDs, as evidenced by the ground truth.
- Slight format differences: the LLM answer uses bullet points and leaves out formatting ("**") and the inline XML tag notation for IDs.
- Technically, the content (the factual changes) is correct, so this is not a critical error, but per the instructions, these seemingly small omissions must result in a significant deduction.

Therefore, the answer deserves an 8.0.
