7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core factual differences (added tasks: "Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code"; removed task: "Send RMA Label"; gateway change: "gw_valid" from exclusive to inclusive). This matches the ground truth's content substantially. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Missing element IDs for tasks**: The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," and BPMN elements are precisely identified by their `id` attributes (e.g., `check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`). The LLM lists only the `name` attributes, omitting these critical identifiers present in the XML and included in the ground truth. This is a significant omission in two categories (added and removed tasks), warranting a major deduction as it reduces precision and traceability.
  
- **Incomplete gateway description**: The LLM omits the version specifiers "(v1)" and "(v2)" from the ground truth, which explicitly tie the change to the provided snippets without speculation. This is a small but factual detail error, leading to notable point loss per instructions.

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Headings use the prompt's exact "â€¢" style (matching required format), but list items use "-" instead of "*" as in ground truth. Bold formatting for gateway types is absent. While not core content, these deviate from the ground truth's presentation, treated as minor errors with some deduction.

No speculation or extraneous content is added (correctly avoiding anything beyond the categories), and no "(none)" is needed. Overall, the answer is accurate in substance (90% alignment) but loses points for precision gaps (IDs, versions) and minor format mismatches, resulting in a strict score of 7.5 rather than 10.0.
