**5.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict line-by-line factual precision vs. ground truth):
- **A1**: Mostly correct (distinct cases = 3), but unnecessary extra details ("(C001, C002, C003) in this fragment") deviate from concise ground truth (**3**). Minor deduction for extra content (-1.0 pt equivalent).
- **A2**: Factually exact sequence matches ground truth. Minor formatting/intro text extras ("The sequence of activities for case **"C002"** is:"), but no factual error. Full credit.
- **A3**: Major failures—missing "Arrange_Delivery" (one of two distinct predecessors), incorrectly lists only "Check_Stock", wrong format (not one per line, not alphabetically ordered), fabricated conclusion ("only one distinct activity"), and contradictory note (acknowledges "Arrange_Delivery" but ignores it in answer). Treated as hallucination (missing + fabricated elements). 0 credit.

**Overall**: Weighted average reflects ~2/3 correct but with A3 hallucination and format/extras dragging down under utmost strictness (no tolerance for missing/fabricated elements).
