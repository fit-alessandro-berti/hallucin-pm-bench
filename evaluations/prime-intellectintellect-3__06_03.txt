9.0

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content (correctly identifies and lists the exact two concurrent task sets in order, using the same task names with backticks, focused solely on Process B). However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.0 point total for minor differences: (1) introductory and explanatory sentences not in ground truth (+extra restatement); (2) "(from Parallel Split #1)" vs. "– first parallel block:" wording; (3) bullet list format vs. inline with ‖ symbol; (4) lacks explicit "No other tasks..." closure. No factual errors, but small stylistic/structure variances warrant the deduction.
