The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (answering "Yes" as required), provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, and offers a brief, accurate justification based on the enabling conditions (p3=1, p4=0 via inhibitor arc). The markings are implied correctly, and it ties back to T3 not having occurred yet. This directly addresses the prompt's requirements without errors.

However, it loses 1.0 point for being less comprehensive than the ground truth: the sequence is truncated (omitting the post-T5 steps to show T3 firing afterward, though not strictly required), the justification is briefer and omits the deeper insight that T5 *must* precede T3 due to the permanent disabling effect of T3 on p4 (a key analytical nuance emphasized in the ground truth), and phrasing is simpler without the full enabling condition formalism or inhibitor arc implications. Under utmost strictness, these omissions in depth and detail constitute small but notable differences warranting a deduction.
