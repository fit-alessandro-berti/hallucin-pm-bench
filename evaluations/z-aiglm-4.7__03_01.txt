**9.0**

The LLM answer accurately models the process described, with exactly the required elements (start event, 6 tasks matching the named activities and implied classification, 3 exclusive gateways for the 3 decision points despite prompt mentioning "two", re-work loop to "Initial Diagnosis", end event), correct sequence flows, and no invented extras like timers, additional activities, events, gateways, or parallel paths. Line count ≤40, concise IDs used, single <definitions> block, no diagram elements.

Minor deductions for strictness (-1.0 total):
- Task types (serviceTask/userTask vs generic <task>): interpretive addition (-0.3).
- Names slightly off ("Classify"/"Start"/"End" vs more descriptive; no gateway names): small inventions (-0.3).
- Condition expressions specific/invented vars vs neutral "yes"/"no" (-0.2).
- Stylistic diffs (no flow IDs, extra xmlns:xsi + id/targetNamespace, process ID/name): non-semantic (-0.2).

Structure, logic, and compliance perfect; no hallucinations.
