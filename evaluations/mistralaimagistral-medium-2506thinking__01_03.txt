### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 7/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two decision points and summarizes their rules accurately in one sentence each, closely aligning with the ground truth. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., not explicitly stating the "otherwise proceed" branch or quoting "Approve" as in ground truth), but no major deviations or omissions.
- **Part (b) - Documents (Score: 0/10)**: Critically incomplete and erroneous. The LLM lists only 3 documents (Form 14B, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration), missing 6 essential ones from the ground truth (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow, Deck Memo, Signed Offer Sheet 77, Loan Dossier 2025). The scorecards are explicitly listed as inputs/documents in step 3 and must appear in first-order sequence after Form 14B. This is a severe hallucination of omission, ignoring the process description's explicit mentions (e.g., "Document: Deck Memo" in step 5, "Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77..." in step 8). Order is partially correct for the listed items but irrelevant given the incompleteness. No mention of avoiding KYC/AML, but the core list failure dominates.
- **Overall (Weighted Average, Strict Penalty for Errors)**: Part (a) is strong, but part (b) represents a fundamental failure to enumerate "all documents... in the order they first appear," resulting in ~67% content omission. Strict policy deducts heavily for such gaps, yielding a low total score. Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., redundant boxed summary) are not scored but do not mitigate.
