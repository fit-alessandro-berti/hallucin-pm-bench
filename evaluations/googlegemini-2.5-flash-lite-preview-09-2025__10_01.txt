3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Strong, +2.5 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear, even implicitly. Activities match the expected six from the process description.
- **Structure and Completeness (Partial, +1.0 point)**: Basic table format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced (meets "unwarranted content" criterion). However, role headers include abbreviations (e.g., "(AM)"), which slightly deviates from the ground truth's clean full names without abbreviations. More critically, the matrix is severely incomplete: most cells are blank, omitting numerous "A" (Accountable), "C" (Consulted), and "I" (Informed) assignments that are explicitly detailed in the ground truth. A full RACI matrix requires indicating involvement for all roles per activity; blanks here imply non-involvement but contradict the ground truth's comprehensive fillings (e.g., multiple "I" and "C" entries).
- **RACI Allocations (Weak, -6.0 points for errors)**: While each activity has exactly one "R" (Responsible), aligning minimally with the narrative's primary handlers (e.g., "R" for AM on Receive Application, CO on KYC Review), this is superficial. Major deviations include:
  - No "A" (Accountable) markings, despite ground truth assigning "R/A" to AM in four activities (Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer) and "A" elsewhere (e.g., AM on KYC Review and Payment Clearance). The rubric emphasizes "Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate," which is entirely missed.
  - Incomplete "C" and "I": For example, Order Vetting has "C" for CO (correct) but omits "I" for FC and IT; Receive Application omits "C" for CO and "I" for FC/IT; Record Update omits "C" for AM/FC and "I" for CO. Every row has such gaps, failing to "reflect the narrative" fully as per the rubric.
  - Bolding: LLM bolds activity names for the mandated terms (unnecessary but harmless), while ground truth bolds "R" cells for emphasisâ€”minor formatting mismatch but contributes to inconsistency.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., missing "I" entries, lack of "A") warrant significant point loss; here, the matrix is ~60-70% divergent in content, rendering it functionally incomplete for a professional RACI tool. Base score starts high for vocabulary/structure but drops sharply for correctness. No self-awareness issues apply.
