8.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, with these (relatively minor, yet notable) discrepancies that justify a significant deduction under strict evaluation:

- The LLM answer uses the heading "### ADDED TASKS" (with Markdown styling), instead of just "ADDED TASKS" as in the ground truth.
- It begins the list with a Markdown "bullet" (`-`) instead of matching the *exact* spacing/alignment of the ground truth.
- The LLM supplies an additional boxed LaTeX-styled version after the Markdown blockâ€”this is extra output and not part of the required three-heading-only format, violating the instruction to supply *only* the three required headings and differences.

Functionally, all IDs and names presented are correct, differences are accurate and verifiable, and the three category groupings are present in order. However, the formatting instructions are not followed with sufficient fidelity and there is extraneous content. Strictly, these are notable errors and justify a loss of 1.5 points.
