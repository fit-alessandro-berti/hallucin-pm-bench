The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed task, and gateway type changes) matching the ground truth content, with no omissions or additions in the listed elements. However, strict evaluation penalizes formatting deviations: (1) headings include extraneous "###" markdown, violating verbatim requirement; (2) backticks around IDs are inconsistently applied compared to the plain-text ground truth; (3) the appended \boxed{} LaTeX-formatted section introduces unrequested commentary and structure, breaching the "output must contain only the three required headings and the concrete differences" rule; (4) minor inconsistencies in colon placement and alignment. These accumulate to a significant deduction despite perfect content accuracy.
