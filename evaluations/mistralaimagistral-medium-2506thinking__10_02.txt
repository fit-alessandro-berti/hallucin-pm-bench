### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates basic adherence to the prompt's vocabulary mandate by correctly using "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst" without substitutions. It produces a Markdown RACI table that covers all elements from the informal description, including separation of the SWIFT message task and explicit inclusion of notification in archiving, which aligns with the source text's coverage. However, it earns a low score due to numerous significant deviations from the ground truth, evaluated strictly as instructed:

- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: The table lacks the "Operations Manager" column present in the ground truth, omitting an entire role that appears central to accountability and consultation in the benchmark. It also omits the legend (R=Responsible, A=Accountable, C=Consulted, I=Informed) and the explanatory notes on vocabulary and mapping, which are explicit in the ground truth.

- **Task Descriptions (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: Tasks do not match the ground truth's wording or granularity. For example, the LLM uses "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Perform KYC review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**" (with bolding); and it splits "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and combines "Archive case file and notify Regulatory Liaison", whereas the ground truth consolidates into 6 tasks without such splits/combinations (e.g., no separate SWIFT task, "Archive Record" without explicit notify). These are not minor rephrasings but substantive alterations, violating strict mapping to the source while diverging from the benchmark.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -1.5 points)**: Assignments differ across nearly every cell, often contradicting the ground truth. Examples include:
  - Receive: LLM assigns R,A to Transaction Analyst only; ground truth assigns R to Analyst, I to Liaison, A to Operations Manager, C to IT Support.
  - Screen: LLM has R (Analyst), A (Liaison); ground truth adds I (Operations Manager), C (IT Support).
  - KYC Review: LLM has R,A (Liaison) only; ground truth has C (Analyst), R (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), I (IT Support).
  - Approve: LLM has I (Analyst), R,A (Liaison); ground truth has C (Analyst), R (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), I (IT Support).
  - Similar mismatches for Release and Archive, ignoring the ground truth's consistent emphasis on Operations Manager's A role and broader C/I distributions.
  These are not small errors but fundamental inaccuracies in role responsibilities.

- **Additional Flaws (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: The LLM includes an unnecessary "Summary and Final Answer" header, which adds extraneous content not in the ground truth. No bolding on R/A as in the benchmark. While vocabulary for mandated terms is correct, non-mandated task phrasing (e.g., retaining "payment" instead of "Payment Instruction") slightly deviates from the ground truth's polished, consistent rephrasing.

The answer is functional as a RACI table but fails to replicate the ground truth's exact structure, assignments, and details, resulting in a score reflecting partial compliance amid pervasive mismatches. A perfect score would require near-identical replication.
