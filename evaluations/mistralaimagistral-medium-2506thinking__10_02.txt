4.5

**Evaluation:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer adheres to the enforced vocabulary, correctly using "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst".
- The answer uses a clean Markdown table and organizes process steps in order.
- All the steps in the process are reflected with corresponding RACI roles.

**Negatives (Strict Penalty for Each):**
1. **Missing Role:** The ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a key RACI column with Accountable roles across all tasks. The LLM omits this entirely, which is a critical omission.
2. **Incorrect R/A Assignment:**
    - LLM marks "Transaction Analyst" as both Responsible and Accountable for some tasks ("Receive and log transfer instruction", "Release payment"), while the ground truth gives Accountable to "Operations Manager" and Responsible to "Transaction Analyst".
    - "Screen payment against sanctions list": Ground truth has Transaction Analyst Responsible, Regulatory Liaison Accountable; LLM gives Transaction Analyst Responsible, Regulatory Liaison Accountable (this matches, but LLM puts Accountable (A) on "Screen payment..." for Regulatory Liaison, but in table header organization and other lines is inconsistent—need even stricter penalty).
3. **Task Naming:** Several task names do not precisely match the mandated vocabulary or the ground truth:
    - E.g., "Perform KYC review on sender and beneficiary": The task should just be "KYC Review" per instructions.
    - "Archive case file and notify Regulatory Liaison" differs from the consistent, concise ground truth "Archive Record".
    - "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" is not present in the ground truth; ground truth deems “Archive Record” as the final step. LLM lists an extra step (though inferred from the source, it's omitted in the ground truth RACI).
4. **Consulted/Informed Missing:** The LLM answer mostly omits Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments. In contrast, the ground truth is careful to designate secondary notified or reference parties for each task.
5. **Legend Missing:** The LLM answer omits a legend for RACI assignments.
6. **Formatting:** The LLM answer puts an unnecessary Markdown code block ("```markdown" ... "```"), while ground truth simply presents the table.

**Strictness Per Instructions:**
- Omission of a critical role (Operations Manager) and consistent misattribution of Accountable responsibilities is a severe flaw.
- Incomplete secondary roles (C/I), inaccurate or unstandardized task naming, and extra or missing steps are significant as per the grading direction.
- Small points retained for general role and vocabulary adherence.

**Conclusion:**
A 4.5/10 reflects that about half the requirements are met, but persistent, significant issues—especially missing a whole RACI role and misattributing accountabilities—result in a substantial deduction.
