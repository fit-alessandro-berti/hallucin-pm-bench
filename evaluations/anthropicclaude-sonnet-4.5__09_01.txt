The LLM answer aligns closely with the ground truth in substance: both correctly state that the average cycle time cannot be computed or derived, emphasizing the absence of timestamps, durations, or any temporal data needed for calculation. This prevents any numeric answer, avoiding fabrication as per the ground truth. The explanation in the LLM answer is more detailed and structured (e.g., specifying what data is present, what's missing, and why the benchmark is irrelevant), which enhances clarity without introducing errors or deviations from the core reasoning. A minor deduction (0.5 points) reflects the slightly expanded scope beyond the ground truth's brevity, but no factual inaccuracies or contradictions exist, maintaining high fidelity under strict evaluation.
