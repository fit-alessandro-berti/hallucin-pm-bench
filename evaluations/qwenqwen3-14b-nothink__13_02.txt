The LLM answer is fully correct and precise for questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth exactly in values and calculations. For question 3, it adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, covers low support (implicitly tying to the single occurrence noted in Q1), notes representational instability ("may not represent the general behavior... misrepresent the typical path"), and cautions against over-generalization ("overemphasize rare cases... inaccurate models or conclusions"). However, it lacks the ground truth's specificity on statistical vulnerabilities (e.g., noise, skewing averages, confidence intervals), making it somewhat superficial and warranting a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
