**9.0**

- **Questions 1, 2a, and 2b:** All numerical answers are correct, with precise calculations in 2a (2.08%) and 2b (8.33%), and the count in 1 (once).
- **Question 3:** The answer correctly mentions infrequency ("occurs infrequently," "may not represent the general behavior," and "could overemphasize rare cases or misrepresent the typical path"), which broadly covers the requirement for noting the activity's rarity and the risk of over-generalization. However, it lacks explicit statements about numerical instability or the statistical unreliability of single cases, such as "variance," "wide confidence intervals," or "skewed averages," all of which are present in the ground truth. That omission is a small but noticeable deficit.
- **Other notes:** The answer does not invent information and is concise.

**Point loss** is mainly due to lack of sharpness/detail in the explanation for Q3, specifically around instability/statistical issues, which were required per instructions. According to the strictness requested, this justifies docking a full point. The other answers are perfect.
