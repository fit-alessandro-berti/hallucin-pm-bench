8.0

- The LLM answer is nearly correct in all determinations (correctly classified each rule as Compliant, Violated, or Not Applicable, and "Overall result" matches ground truth).
- Main loss of points arises from justification accuracy and presentation:
   - For R2, the justification contains a conceptual error: "Change_Request reset the approval chain, yet Ship_Goods occurred before a new Manager_Approval within two days." The issue in the ground truth is that Ship_Goods occurs within two days after the (initial) approvals, but not after the final required approval which, due to the Change_Request, must be the second Manager_Approval (on 07-Mar). Ship_Goods is on 05-Mar, so it's before this. The LLM answer suggests Ship_Goods happened "before a new Manager_Approval within two days" but doesnâ€™t specify the real root cause (that the post-Change_Request approval came after Ship_Goods, not before).
   - For R5, the LLM justification is clear.
   - R3, R4, R1, and R6 justifications are all correct and match the ground truth.
- Overall, the shortcomings are in some misleading or imprecise wording for R2, which could lead to confusion, and a minor ambiguity about the chain reset in R2.
- There are no missing rules, extra statements, or misclassifications.
- Presentation and structure closely follow required answer format and constraints.
- Therefore, overall, 2 full points are docked for the less precise and potentially misleading explanation on R2. The answer is otherwise strong.
