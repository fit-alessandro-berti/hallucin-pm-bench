7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Statuses Match**: All rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT) exactly match the ground truth. This is the core requirement and accounts for the higher score baseline (+7 points).
- **Justification Accuracy and Completeness**:
  - R1: Accurate but adds unnecessary dates/details vs. ground truth's succinct version; minor elaboration (-0.2).
  - R2: Significant error—misattributes violation primarily to pre-approval timing with awkwardly phrased "within two days" clause; fails to specify dates and "> 2 days from final approval" as in ground truth, confusing R2 with R5 elements (-1.5).
  - R3: Exact match in status and justification wording/timing; perfect (+0).
  - R4: Accurate and equivalent (non-hazardous vs. hazardous=false); minor wording variance (-0.1).
  - R5: Captures essence (Change_Request after approvals, further steps before new Manager_Approval) but omits Pay_Invoice (ground truth includes it explicitly as a violated "further processing step"); incomplete (-0.5).
  - R6: Exact match; perfect (+0).
- **Format**: Vertical list is functionally compliant with prompt (no table required), but ground truth uses table; no major deduction (-0.2 overall for style).
- **Word Limits**: All justifications ≤20 words; compliant (+0).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, small errors (e.g., R1/R4/R5 omissions/elaborations) deduct notably, and R2's imprecise explanation (potentially misleading on rule interpretation) causes significant loss. Total deductions lead to 7.5 from a 10.0 max.
