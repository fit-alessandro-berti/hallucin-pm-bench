- The LLM answer is nearly perfect: it lists the correct number of cases, the correct immediately preceding activity for C456's "Ship_Order," and correctly identifies the only activity that appears exactly once.
- Small deduction (0.5): The instructions specified a concise, bullet-point style. The LLM's formatting is correct but not fully consistent with the ground truth's format (which uses asterisks and explicit labeling of A1, A2, A3). For strictness, this small formatting discrepancy results in a slight loss of points. Otherwise, all content is accurate.
