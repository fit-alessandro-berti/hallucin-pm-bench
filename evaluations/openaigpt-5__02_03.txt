- The LLM answer correctly identifies all three key elements (3 cases, Pack_Items for A2, Cancel_Order for A3) with exact content matching the ground truth.
- Minor deductions for slight formatting differences: uses plain bullets instead of labeled bold (e.g., **A1:**), adds "distinct" in A1 and restates the question in A2 (less concise than ground truth's brevity), and includes quotes around activity names not present in ground truth. No factual errors, but strict adherence to the prompt's "concise, bullet-point answers only" and ground truth structure is not perfectly replicated.
