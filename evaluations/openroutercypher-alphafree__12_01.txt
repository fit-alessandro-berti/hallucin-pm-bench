### Score: 4.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a partial justification by analyzing the reversed order in Cases 1001 and 1003, aligning with the ground truth's core evidence for those cases. However, it earns a significantly reduced score due to multiple strict violations:

- **Major omission of Case 1002**: The LLM entirely ignores this case, where `Update_Inventory` is absent despite `Authorize_Refund` occurring. This directly disproves the "always" claim (as the ground truth emphasizes), making the analysis incomplete and invalidating the LLM's assertion that `Authorize_Refund` "always" comes after `Update_Inventory`. Covering only 2/3 of the cases is a critical gap in evidence-based evaluation.

- **Failure to address "immediately"**: The ground truth notes the lack of immediate precedence in *any* case (e.g., Quality_Check intervenes in Case 1003). The LLM glosses over this, vaguely stating "occurs after" without precision, weakening the refutation.

- **Weaker conclusion and lack of specificity**: The LLM's phrasing ("lacks support... appears to always come after") is speculative and not strictly data-bound, contrasting the ground truth's definitive "false" verdict with line citations and exhaustive case coverage. No mention of timestamps or lines reduces evidentiary rigor.

- **Minor structural issues**: While concise, it lacks the ground truth's clear "verdict + justification" format and evidence citations, per the prompt's emphasis on meticulous, data-strict analysis.

Overall, the answer is directionally correct but substantially flawed in completeness and precision, justifying a mid-low score under strict criteria.
