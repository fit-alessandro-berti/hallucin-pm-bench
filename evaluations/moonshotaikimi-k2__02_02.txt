### Evaluation Breakdown
This evaluation is conducted line-by-line against the ground truth, with utmost strictness as instructed. Factual content is correct across all questions (no fabrications or missing facts), but differences in phrasing, extra content, and formatting result in deductions. Extra elements are treated as minor hallucinations per the guidelines, and even small formatting deviations incur significant point loss. Overall score reflects near-perfect factual accuracy but penalized for not matching the concise, exact ground truth structure.

- **Q1/A1**: Ground truth is simply **3**. The LLM answer is factually correct but includes unnecessary extra content ("There are **3 distinct cases** (C001, C002, C003)"), which is treated as a hallucination-like addition. This deviates significantly from the minimal expected response. Score: 5.0/10.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact match in content and sequence (including separators and activity names with underscores). No extras, missing elements, or formatting issues. Score: 10.0/10.
- **Q3/A3**: Content is factually precise (correct distinct activities, alphabetically ordered, one per line). However, it lacks the bullet-like dashes ("-") present in the ground truth, and uses plain line breaks instead of <br> for explicit formatting. This is a small but notable formatting deviation under strict criteria. Score: 9.0/10.

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average (equal parts per question) = (5.0 + 10.0 + 9.0) / 3 = 8.0. The response is strong on facts but loses points for verbosity and minor format mismatches.
