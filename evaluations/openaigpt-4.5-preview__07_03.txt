The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth answer, with all changes correctly and exhaustively identified under the required headings. There is just a very minor difference in spacing: in the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section, the ground truth includes extra spaces for alignment in the second entry ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel"), while the LLM answer does not. This is a cosmetic formatting issue and not a substantive error, but since utmost strictness is requested and even small errors should be penalized, this minor formatting difference warrants a one-point deduction.
