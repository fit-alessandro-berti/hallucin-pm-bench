9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), matching the ground truth content exactly. However, it introduces minor formatting discrepancies: extra blank lines after each heading (ground truth has none, with lists immediately following), and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. ground truth's "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" with five spaces for column alignment). Under strict evaluation, these small formatting errors warrant a 1.0-point deduction from a perfect score.
