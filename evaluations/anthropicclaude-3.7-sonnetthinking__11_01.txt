9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer fully matches the ground truth on core correctness: it accurately identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120.0h; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4h), quotes figures verbatim, stays under 150 words (~120 words), and omits all non-waiting metrics or unrelated activities. Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for delays), and explicitly promise â‰¥20% reductions (30%, 25%, 25%), aligning with relevance criteria.

Minor deductions: 
- Format adds a title, section header, and closing sentence for polish, slightly diverging from the ground truth's ultra-concise, bullet-only style (potentially less "crisp").
- Actions are relevant but less explicitly "data-driven" than ground truth (e.g., no "pilot tests show" or "estimated" evidence phrasing; reductions feel more assumptive than tied to implied data). This reflects a small interpretive gap on "data-driven," warranting a 1.0-point loss under strictness.
