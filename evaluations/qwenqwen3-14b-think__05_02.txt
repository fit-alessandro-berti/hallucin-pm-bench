5.0

The LLM answer correctly applies the allowed kind of change—a due date reduction—for the "Collect Equipment" user task, which aligns with the requirement to improve SLA compliance while neither adding nor deleting activities. The format of the response (a single unified diff and a brief rationale) is also correct.

However, the answer only reduces the due date from P5D to P4D, whereas the ground truth shows that it should be reduced to P2D to ensure the onboarding cycle meets the contractual 3-day SLA. This is a significant miss, as the proposed improvement yields a much smaller acceleration of the process and may not suffice to remedy the SLA breach. The rationale in the LLM answer also lacks explicit reference to the 3-day SLA and the necessity of hitting a specified contractual limit.

Thus, the answer is correct in method and form but materially insufficient in the extent of its change. This merits a significant penalty, and so the score is 5.0.
