4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Alignment with Rules and Output Format**: The LLM answer proposes exactly one modification (changing an attribute, no add/delete activities or sequence flows), and provides a diff followed by a one-sentence rationale, partially adhering to the format. However, the diff is not a clean "unified diff single hunk" as specified—it's malformed (includes unnecessary unchanged lines, incorrectly marks the `Task_GrantAccess` as a change with identical -/+ lines, and uses full git-style headers like `--- a/process.bpmn` which aren't in the ground truth or prompt example). This is a significant formatting error under strict evaluation (-1.5 points).
- **Accuracy of Improvement**: The LLM correctly identifies the `Task_CollectEquipment` as the target for modification (the likely bottleneck with P5D), but changes it to "P4D" instead of the ground truth's "P2D". This is a major factual error: P4D only reduces the delay marginally (by 1 day, as noted), but fails to align with the implied 3-day end-to-end SLA target in the ground truth, where P2D is needed to "keep the overall onboarding cycle inside the contractual 3-day SLA". Small errors like this value discrepancy warrant significant deduction (-3.0 points from a potential 10).
- **Rationale Quality**: The sentence is concise but incomplete and mismatched—it mentions shortening "total end-to-end SLA by 1 day" without referencing the specific 3-day contractual SLA or explaining why P4D suffices, unlike the ground truth's precise tie-in to the 3-day limit. This reduces effectiveness and fidelity (-1.0 point).
- **Overall Fidelity to Ground Truth**: High-level intent (tighten the longest dueDate) is partially correct, but core differences in the diff content, exact change, and rationale details make it substantially divergent. Under utmost strictness, this earns a low passing score, as it avoids violating rules but doesn't deliver the expected precise fix.
