A1: Correct (3).  
A2: Correct sequence and formatting.  
A3: Contains extra activity "Receive_Order" which is NOT an immediate predecessor to "Ship_Order" in this data. The correct answers are only "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock".

The only fault is the inclusion of an incorrect third activity in A3, a significant but not extreme error (all true predecessors are included, no true ones are omitted). Strict marking requires a meaningful penalty, but the answer is strong overall.
