7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, though not required):
- **A1**: Exact match to ground truth (3). Full credit.
- **A2**: Exact match to ground truth sequence, including order, separators, and activity names (underscores intact). Full credit.
- **A3**: Partial credit. Lists correctly include "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" (alphabetically ordered as required). Format is "one per line" as prompted (ground truth uses markdown bullets, but this is minor). However, fabricates an extra/hallucinated item ("Receive_Order"), which does not immediately precede "Ship_Order" in any caseâ€”this is a significant factual error under strict evaluation rules, warranting a deduction. No other items are missing.
