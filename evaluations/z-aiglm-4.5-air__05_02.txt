6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, though not required in response):
- **Correctness of improvement**: The LLM correctly identifies the `Task_CollectEquipment` as the target (the bottleneck with P5D dueDate) and proposes a valid attribute modification without adding/deleting elements, aligning with rules. However, it changes to P3D instead of the ground truth's P2D, which is a substantive error assuming the ground truth optimizes precisely for a 3-day SLA total (cumulative due dates suggest P2D would align better: 1+2+3+2+1=9 days? Wait, ground truth implies tighter fit, but prompt lacks explicit SLA math—still, mismatch deducts heavily under strictness).
- **Diff format**: Simple -/+ lines are incomplete for "unified diff (single hunk)"; lacks @@ hunk header and exact line spacing/padding from ground truth XML, making it non-compliant with output spec (major deduction).
- **Rationale**: One sentence as required, but imprecise—mentions "3 days" (matching its diff) instead of "2 days," omits "contractual 3-day SLA" reference and "without introducing new activities" clause, reducing specificity and fidelity to ground truth (moderate deduction).
- **Overall strictness**: Proposal is logically sound and follows rules, but deviations in value, format, and rationale details warrant significant point loss (not a 10.0 match, but not zero effort).
