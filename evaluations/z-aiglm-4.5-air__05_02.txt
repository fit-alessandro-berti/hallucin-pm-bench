6.0

The LLM answer is mostly correct in formâ€”providing a single well-formed diff and a concise rationale. However, it proposes reducing the due date for "Collect Equipment" to 3 days (P3D), while the ground truth reduces it to 2 days (P2D). This is a non-trivial error, as the stricter reduction to 2 days is key to achieving compliance with the stated contractual 3-day SLA according to the ground truth rationale.

Other strengths:
- The suggested change is valid per the task rules (modifies only an existing attribute, single hunk, and single change).
- The rationale is clear and accurate in its intent.

Major issue:
- The due date value is not aggressive enough versus the ground truth, potentially failing to ensure full SLA compliance.

Because the substantive improvement falls short of the optimal, and as per instructions even small errors should have significant point impact, I subtract 4 points for this core gap, resulting in a score of 6.0.
