### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the prompt's requirements for factual XML-based analysis without speculation. Headings match the prompt exactly. However, under utmost strictness:
- Added an unrequested title ("# BPMN XML Change Analysis"), deviating from the prompt's instruction to summarize only under the specified headings (-0.5).
- In "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks," presents IDs as primary with names in parentheses (e.g., "check_vip (name: ...)"), inverting the ground truth's name-primary format (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)") and not emphasizing the `name` attribute as prominently as implied by "element names exactly as they appear" (-1.0 total, -0.5 per category).
- In "Gateway type changes," omits version references "(v1)" and "(v2)" present in ground truth, reducing precision (-0.5).
These are small but clear differences in structure and detail, warranting a significant deduction while recognizing the core accuracy. No other errors (e.g., no incorrect facts, no "(none)" needed).
