The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and enumeration of the exact parallel blocks from Process B (P1, P2, and P3). It correctly excludes sequential tasks and other processes. The only minor difference is the absence of spaces after commas in task lists (e.g., "Generate_CAD_Drawing,Confirm_Materials_Availability" vs. "Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability"), which is a small formatting inconsistency not explicitly required by the prompt but present in the ground truth. Under strict evaluation, this deducts a minimal amount, but the response fully meets the core requirements.
