4.0

The LLM answer captures the overall semantic structure of the process (start, validation loop with completeness gateway, warranty decision, parallel activities with split/join, sequential post-parallel tasks, and two end events) but has significant deviations from the ground truth and prompt requirements, warranting major deductions under strict evaluation. Key issues include:

- **Invalid XML structure**: Two critical sequence flows are referenced in incoming/outgoing but not defined (`wrc_flow_1` from start to validate, `wrc_flow_6` from check eligibility to warranty gateway), making the document non-self-contained and non-executable as BPMN. This alone is a fatal error for a required "self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document," deducting heavily for completeness.

- **Extra/hallucinated element relative to ground truth**: Includes an explicit task for "checks warranty eligibility" (required by prompt but omitted in ground truth, where the warranty gateway directly follows the completeness gateway). This adds an unneeded step in comparison, violating the minimal equivalence expectation and introducing a flow difference.

- **Task name mismatches (non-verbatim and differing from ground)**: Several names deviate in tense, capitalization, and phrasing, e.g., "validates the claim" vs. ground's "Validate the claim"; "sends rejection notice" vs. "Send rejection notice"; "create shipment order" (lowercase, incomplete phrasing) vs. "Create shipment order"; similar for "schedule courier pickup". Even small verbatim discrepancies (per prompt) and ground differences cost points strictly.

- **Event name mismatches**: Start event "Start" vs. ground's "Online warranty claim submitted" (directly from prompt); both ends "End" vs. ground's "Successful end" and "Rejected". Omits prompt-aligned naming.

- **Element specification differences**: Uses specific types like `userTask` and `serviceTask` vs. ground's generic `task`; adds names to parallel gateways ("Parallel Split"/"Join") vs. ground's unnamed; uses `conditionExpression` with true/false vs. ground's flow `name="Yes"/"No"`. These are semantically equivalent but structurally divergent.

- **Minor XML/style differences**: Default namespace (no prefix) vs. ground's `bpmn:` prefix; mixed element ordering (flows interspersed vs. grouped); extra attributes (e.g., `expressionLanguage`, `typeLanguage`); longer/more verbose than ground's minimal 34 lines.

No omissions of required elements (all prompt flows modeled without inventions like error paths), but the combination of invalidity, extras, and mismatches prevents full credit. Semantically ~80% aligned (core flow intact), but strict rubric for differences drops to 4.0.
