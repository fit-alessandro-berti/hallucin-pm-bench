The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel, in the correct alphabetical order both within pairs and overall. No extraneous pairs or references to Process A are included. However, under utmost strictness, minor formatting discrepancies deduct a point: the output lacks the precise spacing and alignment present in the ground truth (e.g., no padding spaces to align the em dashes across lines, and inconsistent spacing around the em dash compared to the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` with double spaces). The absence of the code block wrapper is also a small but notable deviation from the ground truth presentation.
