7.5

— The LLM answer for 1️⃣ is **correct** and matches the ground truth exactly.

— For 2️⃣, the LLM answer correctly emphasizes the limitations of small, potentially unrepresentative samples and the risk of over- or underestimating the frequency of “Manual Fraud Check.” However, the explanation is fairly generic—it does not reference the tiny sample size, short time window, or the raw number of cases/events found in the snippet. 

— The LLM misses two concrete elements emphasized in the ground truth:
  - That a single event influences the apparent frequency drastically (the impact of sample size on sampling error and confidence interval).
  - The effect of near-synonym activity names (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) potentially misleading fuzzy string searches.
  - It does not mention the necessity of a larger or random sample for reliable estimation.
  - It does not count the specific event (case 1002 at 09:07:13) or reference that <2 hours are covered.

Score loses points for these omissions, though the general thrust is accurate and not factually wrong. 7.5 reflects that it is clear, substantially correct, but not as exact, process-aware, or nuanced as the ground truth.
