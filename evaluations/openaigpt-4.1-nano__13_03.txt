### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Exact match (both identify 1 occurrence). Full points here.
- **Question 2**: The LLM answer is concise (102 words, within limit) and correctly identifies core issues like small sample size, non-representativeness, and risk of under/overestimation. However, it lacks the ground truth's precision and depth: no quantification of sample size (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), no discussion of statistical impacts (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence interval, sampling error for rare events), and critically omits the key pitfall of near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) causing distortion via strict vs. fuzzy matching. This makes it shallower and less analytically rigorous, warranting a significant deduction for incompleteness despite no factual errors. Overall, a solid but incomplete response.
