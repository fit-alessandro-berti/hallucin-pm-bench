3.5

R1: LLM incorrectly states "Violated" because it confuses the R1 requirement. In fact, the rule is compliant: Manager followed by Finance approval before >10K PO continues. This is a severe error.

R2: LLM says "Not Applicable," but expedited is true and should be checked; it's in fact violated. Serious error.

R3: Correct identification of violation (Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods) and proper justification.

R4: Correctly marked Not Applicable.

R5: Incorrectly marked as Compliant; it's violated since Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice happened before new Manager_Approval after Change_Request.

R6: Correctly marked Compliant; Archive_Record is present.

Overall: Major flaws in rules R1, R2, R5. Only R3, R4, and R6 are reliable. The final overall compliance status is correct, but the reasoning is off for several rules.

Thus, substantial detail and correctness are missing for at least half of the rules. Considerable deductions for misreading logic and not following requirements.

Final score: **3.5**
