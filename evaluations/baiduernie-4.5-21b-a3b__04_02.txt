3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Incorrect status (Violated vs. Compliant) and justification (wrongly ties to R3; ignores proper approval sequence). Major error (-2 points).
- **R2**: Incorrect status (Not Applicable vs. Violated) and justification (misinterprets timeline; ignores post-change approval delay). Major error (-2 points).
- **R3**: Correct status and mostly accurate justification (minor phrasing difference, but dates align). No deduction.
- **R4**: Correct status and justification. No deduction.
- **R5**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification (ignores pre-approval actions like Ship_Goods/Pay_Invoice). Major error (-2 points).
- **R6**: Correct status and justification. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct result (NON-COMPLIANT), but cites wrong violations (R1/R3 vs. R2/R3/R5), undermining analysis. Partial credit (+1 point).

Total: Starts at 10, deduct 6 for three major rule errors, +1 for overall result accuracy = 5 base, further -2 for strictness on small errors like justification flaws and format inconsistencies (e.g., no table, but prompt allows text), netting 3.0. Response is partially useful but fundamentally flawed in compliance analysis.
