The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides accurate counterexamples for Cases 1001 and 1003, with a supporting note that aligns with the ground truth's observation that the claimed sequence never occurs. However, it omits any mention of Case 1002 (where `Update_Inventory` is absent despite `Authorize_Refund` occurring), which the ground truth explicitly cites as a key disproof of the "always" claim. This incompleteness in covering all relevant cases reduces the thoroughness of the justification, warranting a deduction despite the overall correctness.
