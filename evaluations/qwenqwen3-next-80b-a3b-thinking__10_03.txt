5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates substantial effort to follow the vocabulary policy, as only the authorized terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") are used for activities. However, strict evaluation reveals the following significant departures from the ground truth:

**Major issues:**

- **Structure:** The LLM answer presents roles as separate columns ("Responsible", "Accountable", etc.) rather than as activities-vs-roles as required; it ignores the specified axis structure of the ground truth.  
- **Extranous/Missing Activities:** It invents “Treasury Ops Schedules Payment” and “Treasury Ops Releases Funds and Notifies,” which do not directly correspond to a single activity in the process (the ground truth correctly condenses all fund movement into "Release Funds").  
- “Compliance Officer Approval” appears with the correct name, but “Treasury Ops Schedules Payment” is not part of the specified activity list.
- The notification to the originating analyst is not a standalone activity in the ground truth, so its separate listing in the LLM output is a deviation.
- **Assignment of RACI:** Multiple assignment mismatches to the ground truth:
    - For Intake Vetting, both “R” and “A” must be Front-Office Analyst; here “Accountable” is repeated, but there’s confusion with “Informed” (should be Treasury Ops).
    - For KYC Review and AML Screening, “Accountable” should be the Compliance Analyst, with Compliance Officer merely “Consulted”. The answer assigns “Accountable” to Compliance Officer.
    - For Risk Scoring, “Accountable” should be Compliance Officer, not Compliance Analyst (who should be only R). Consulted is omitted, and “Treasury Ops” is incorrectly “Informed”.
    - “Compliance Officer Approval” is over-complicated in “Consulted” and “Informed,” distributing roles not in ground truth.
    - For “Release Funds,” it splits the activity inaccurately and assigns roles incorrectly.
- **Use of “C”/“I”:** The table sometimes omits “Consulted” when ground truth includes it (e.g., in Risk Scoring).
- **No dashes for uninvolved roles; not matching “R, A” compact notation;** doesn’t fully match the expected matrix output style.
- **Roles:** The LLM adds participants to C and I columns not assigned in ground truth.
- **Role/Activity matching:** In several cases, the LLM marks Front-Office Analyst as “Consulted” or “Informed,” but ground truth assigns them differently.
- **Markdown formatting:** The markdown is functional but not in the expected format.

**Minor issues:**

- Some “Informed” and “Consulted” roles are present where they shouldn’t be, or absent when ground truth requires them.
- The table does not follow the compact “R, A” shorthand, instead splitting R and A into separate columns.

**Positives:**

- Only the correct authorized terms for the four activities appear—no disallowed synonyms.
- Activity names use all four required terms and do not include banned phrases.
- Basic attempt to apply RACI assignments for each activity and role.

**Summary:**  
Despite some correct use of vocabulary and diligent construction, the misalignment of matrix structure, several major assignment mismatches, and additional/extraneous activities represent significant deviations per strict criteria. These errors justify deducting half the points; thus, the score is **5.0**.
