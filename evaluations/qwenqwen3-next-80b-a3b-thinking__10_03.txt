### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt but incurs significant deductions due to multiple deviations from the ground truth, evaluated with strictness as instructed. Key issues include:

- **Table Structure (Major Error, -3.0 points)**: The LLM uses a non-standard RACI format with RACI categories (Responsible, Accountable, etc.) as columns and roles distributed within cells. The ground truth employs the conventional RACI structure with activities as rows and roles (Front-Office Analyst, Compliance Analyst, Compliance Officer, Treasury Ops) as columns, using notations like "R, A", "C", "I", or "–". This inversion misaligns with standard RACI presentation and the ground truth, making direct comparisons awkward and reducing clarity/utility.

- **Activities Coverage and Handling (Major Error, -2.0 points)**: The prompt requires covering "every activity and role described" without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM introduces 7 activities, splitting the narrative's end-process (scheduling and releasing/notifying) into two separate rows ("Treasury Ops Schedules Payment" and "Treasury Ops Releases Funds and Notifies"), which adds granularity not present in the ground truth's 6 activities. This violates "do not rename, merge, or add" by effectively adding and renaming (e.g., no single "Release Funds" as in ground truth). While the four mandated activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) are correctly named and included, the extras disrupt fidelity.

- **RACI Assignments (Multiple Errors, -1.0 points total)**:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM correctly assigns R/A to Front-Office Analyst but lists Compliance Analyst as "Informed" (instead of ground truth's "C") and omits Treasury Ops as "I"; no "Consulted" entry for Compliance Analyst.
  - **KYC Review & AML Screening**: Both are identical in LLM (Compliance Analyst as R, Compliance Officer as A, Front-Office Analyst as C), but ground truth has Compliance Analyst as R/A and Compliance Officer as C for both; LLM also omits Treasury Ops as "I" and misplaces accountability/consultation.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM assigns Compliance Analyst as R and Compliance Officer as A, with Treasury Ops as "I", but misses ground truth's Front-Office Analyst as "C" and Compliance Analyst as only "R" (not A).
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Mostly aligns (Compliance Officer as R/A, Compliance Analyst as C, Front-Office Analyst as I), but LLM incorrectly adds Treasury Ops as "I" (ground truth: "–").
  - **End-Process Activities**: LLM's split rows both assign Treasury Ops as R/A and Front-Office Analyst as "I", but ground truth's single "Release Funds" includes Consulted roles for Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer (missed entirely) and Informed for Front-Office Analyst.

- **Vocabulary Compliance (No Deduction, +1.0 baseline)**: Correctly uses only the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", "Sanctions Check", or "risk rating"). This is a strength but insufficient to offset other flaws.

Overall, while the output is a valid Markdown table and attempts comprehensive coverage, the cumulative differences (structure, activity handling, and ~40% mismatch in assignments across cells) result in a low score. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, core intent is met only partially.
