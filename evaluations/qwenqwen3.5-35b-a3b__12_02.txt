The LLM answer is essentially identical to the ground truth in content, structure adherence (prompt specifies "one paragraph," which the LLM follows precisely while the ground truth uses bullets), and accuracy. It correctly identifies the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), uses precise citations by case-ID and line numbers, and provides a logically equivalent justification emphasizing that these violate the "always follows" claim. No factual errors, omissions, or deviations; phrasing differences are negligible stylistic variations without impacting correctness or completeness.
