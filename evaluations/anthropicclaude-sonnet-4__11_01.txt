### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities are accurately identified and ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5h/120.0h, etc.). No service times, throughput, or other activities are mentioned. (+10/10)
- **Format and Constraints**: Memo structure is crisp and executive-appropriate (headers, bullet points), under 150 words (~120 words). Adheres to "only these three activities" and waiting-time focus. Ground truth is more minimalist (bullets without full headers), but this doesn't violate the prompt. (+9/10; minor deduction for not matching ground truth's ultra-concise style exactly)
- **Actions**: Concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation/reminders for documents, immediate triggers for letters, prioritization for assessment). Each implies ≥20% reduction potential. However, they lack the "data-driven" element required—ground truth includes specifics like "pilot tests show ≥25%", "estimated 30%", or "targeting 20-25%" for evidence-based claims, while the LLM's are generic proposals without any data backing. Actions also differ in phrasing/detail (e.g., LLM's "SMS/email reminders" vs. ground truth's "24h escalation triggers"; similar intent but not identical). (-2 points for differences and missing data support)
- **Unwarranted Content**: Introduces extras like "account for the majority of our claims processing delays" (untrue/unsupported—ranking is per-activity avg wait, not total delay across executions), "reduce by 25-40% within 90 days" (invented aggregate % without data, violating "data-driven"), and "Immediate escalation recommended" (not required). These add fluff and risk straying from strict focus, unlike ground truth's precision. (-1.5 points for extras/inventions)

Overall, strong on core facts but penalized strictly for action divergences, missing data rationale, and extraneous claims that dilute adherence to the prompt/ground truth.
