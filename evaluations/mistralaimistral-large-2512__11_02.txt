### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment) as ground truth. Concise memo format (under 200 words). Explanations cite relevant metrics (e.g., waits, processing, rework, SLA). Concrete, data-driven recommendations provided for each, tied to issues (e.g., AI for review variability).
- **Major Deductions (significant point loss per strict criteria):**
  - **Factual errors in explanations (strict table fidelity violated):**
    - Request_Documents: Claims "lowest throughput (190 cases/day)" — **false**; Review_Documents (185), Approve_Claim (182), etc., are lower. Ground truth avoids this by noting "throughput drops to 190" without false ranking.
    - Initial_Assessment: Claims "second-highest SLA breaches (3.2%) and rework (1.8%)" — **false**; both are *third*-highest (SLA: Review 12.4 > Request 5.5 > Initial 3.2; rework: Request 22 > Review 5.3 > Initial 1.8). Ground truth lists metrics factually without erroneous rankings.
  - **Order mismatch:** Lists Review first (debatable as "worst"); ground truth prioritizes Request (clearest bottleneck by wait/rework drop). Prompt implies data-driven prioritization; ambiguity not acknowledged.
  - **Extraneous content:** Note on "Check Coverage" and "Calculate Payout" as "minor inefficiencies" dilutes focus on top 3 (unnecessary per task). Ground truth stays laser-focused.
  - **Missing elements from ground truth:** No upstream/downstream flow analysis, projected impacts (e.g., "lift end-to-end throughput by ≈10%"), or intro framing ("data isolate three clear performance hotspots").
  - **Minor style diffs:** Spaces vs. underscores in activity names; less interpretive flow emphasis.
- **Overall:** Core structure matches, but factual inaccuracies (2 direct misreads of rankings/lowest) and extras represent >20% deviation from ground truth's precision. Strict rubric: -3.8 from 10.0.
