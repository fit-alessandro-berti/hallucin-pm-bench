The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth and prompt rules by modifying attributes of two sequence flows (exceeding the limit of reversing one if necessary), fails to produce a valid single-hunk diff that improves SLA compliance (reordering does not reduce total sequential duration from 12 to 8 days and does not enable parallelism without additional gateways), provides an incorrect rationale misstating the process impact, and ignores the simpler attribute modification (dueDate adjustment) that aligns with the ground truth's effective fix.
