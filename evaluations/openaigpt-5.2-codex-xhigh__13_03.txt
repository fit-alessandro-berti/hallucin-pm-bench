**8.4**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1 (exact count)**: Perfect match (1 occurrence). No deductions.
- **Part 2**: Strong overlap on small sample size (3 cases, short window/March 1), unrepresentativeness of full month, and naming variations (e.g., automatic fraud labels). Under 120 words (~85). However, deducts for:
  - Missing quantitative sampling error insight (GT's "0% to 7%" swing, wide CI, rare-event volatility via "one extra/missing line"—core to misestimation risk; LLM qualitative only).
  - Vague phrasing ("could hide manual checks"—GT precisely notes strict/fuzzy matching distortion).
  - No event count (GT's "14 events") or exact citation (GT specifies case/timestamp).
  - Shallower statistical depth, reducing precision/impact.

Strict grading reflects these omissions as significant gaps from GT's rigor.
