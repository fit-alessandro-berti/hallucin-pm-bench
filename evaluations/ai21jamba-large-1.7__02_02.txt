7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Perfect match to ground truth (exact count and implicit verification via listed cases). No errors. (10/10 contribution)
- **Q2**: Core sequence matches ground truth exactly (activities and order). However, unnecessary and incorrect formatting (e.g., "**Sequence**:" label and C# code block) introduces extraneous elements, which under strict rules counts as a minor hallucination/distraction from precise output. (8/10 contribution)
- **Q3**: Distinct activities are correct (no extras or misses), but the list is not alphabetically ordered as explicitly required (Check_Stock listed before Arrange_Delivery, reversing the ground truth order). Additionally, the reasoning fabricates an invalid "predecessor" (Ship_Order for line 10, misunderstanding per-case sequences vs. global log order), which is a significant error despite not propagating to the final list. This violates factual precision and prompt instructions. (4/10 contribution)

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average across questions (equal weight), adjusted downward for strictness on ordering, reasoning flaws, and formatting issues as specified. Total differences (order reversal, flawed analysis, extra formatting) warrant a mid-range deduction from a potential 10.0.
