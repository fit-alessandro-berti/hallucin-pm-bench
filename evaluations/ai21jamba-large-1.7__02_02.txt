9.5

- Q1: Correct – answer is **3**.
- Q2: Perfectly correct – precise activity sequence, exact order, and matching formatting with arrow separator.
- Q3: The answer is correct: "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" (one per line, alphabetically ordered). The answer also provides some extra explanation about checking previous lines and potential confusion over the Ship_Order to Ship_Order case, but the listed activities and their ordering is correct and matches the ground truth.

Minor deduction (-0.5) for unnecessary justification about “Ship_Order” being preceded by another “Ship_Order”—this is technically accurate in the context of the raw lines, but not required, since the actual activity sequence across cases per definition isn’t about previous log line but about previous event in the same case, and “Ship_Order” never directly follows itself in any case. However, the final listed answers themselves are correct.
