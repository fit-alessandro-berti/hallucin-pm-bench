### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and it accurately quantifies the absolute SLA exceedances in seconds within parentheses (+60s, +300s, +300s), aligning with the ground truth's focus on seconds. It also structures recommendations in bullet points only, as required, and sticks to table-provided activities and metrics without extraneous inventions there.

However, under utmost strictness, several significant flaws warrant a substantial deduction:
- **Quantification errors**: The answer unnecessarily introduces percentage exceedances, which are factually incorrect (e.g., Credit Assessment is 25% over SLA, not 160%; Legal Approval is 50% over, not 130%; Risk Review is 100% over, not 130%). The prompt specifies quantifying "by how much each activity exceeds its SLA" without mentioning percentages, mirroring the ground truth's absolute seconds approach— this addition introduces confusion and inaccuracy, a major deviation.
- **Recommendations**: While concrete, they are not sufficiently "data-driven" per the prompt and table (e.g., no table data supports "risk level priority," "digital signatures," or "outsourcing to firms"; these feel generic and inventive). The ground truth's actions are more precisely tied to process logic (e.g., "low-risk bypass," "add analyst for peak," "straight-through for under €25k"), even if interpretive—LLM's lack this grounding, reducing specificity and fidelity.
- **Memo format and completeness**: Lacks formal elements like "To/From/Subject" present in ground truth; word count is ~120 (under ≈150 target); includes unprompted "Dear COO" and sign-off phrasing that mismatches the analyst role slightly. No projection or total cases summary (ground truth includes ~4,805 cases from data summation), missing opportunities to ground further in supplied data.
- **Minor issues**: Bolding and structure slightly diverge (e.g., activities listed under intro paragraph in LLM vs. integrated bolded lines in ground truth); waiting times mentioned but not emphasized as "accumulating largest queues" per ground truth phrasing.

Overall, core identification and basic quantification match (~70% alignment), but errors in added elements, weaker data-driven recommendations, and format gaps create notable differences, justifying a mid-low score.
