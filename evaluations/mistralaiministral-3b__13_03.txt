3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Part 1 (Factual Accuracy)**: The LLM incorrectly states the activity occurs "twice," but the excerpt shows it exactly once (case 1002, 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z). This is a clear counting error, violating the "exact" string match requirement and the instruction to answer strictly from data. Severe deduction (-7 points).
- **Part 2 (Explanation Quality and Depth)**: The response is generic and superficial, noting only small sample size and lack of totals without quantifying (e.g., 14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours) or addressing sampling error specifics like frequency swings (0% to 7%), wide confidence intervals, rare event bias, or synonym confusion ("Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). It misses key analytical insights on why misestimation occurs for rare events, including matching pitfalls. Under 120 words but lacks rigor and precision. Partial credit for basic subset mention (+0.5 points), but major gaps warrant heavy penalty (-4.5 points).

Overall: Low score due to factual inaccuracy in Q1 and incomplete analysis in Q2; strict criteria amplify these flaws.
