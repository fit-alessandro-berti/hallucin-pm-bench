The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets in Process B, with accurate tasks, numbering, and order, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements. Differences are limited to minor stylistic variations (e.g., curly braces and descriptive phrases vs. ground truth's backticks, bold formatting, â€– symbol, and "parallel block" labels; omission of the closing sentence, which is not required by the prompt and does not change the core content). Under strict evaluation, these formatting and wording discrepancies warrant a small deduction, but the substantive match is near-perfect.
