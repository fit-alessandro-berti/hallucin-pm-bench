The LLM answer correctly identifies one decision point (eligibility check) and provides an accurate, complete list of all required documents, matching the ground truth exactly on that section. However, it severely under-identifies decision points by recognizing only one explicit point and downplaying others (e.g., via the interpretive note on Finance_Controller_PreApprove), missing two critical branches: the amount threshold (> â‚¬1,000) after pre-approval and the final approval/rejection logic for proceeding to payment. This incompleteness in summarizing "every decision point" represents a major factual omission relative to the process description and ground truth, warranting substantial deduction despite the documents section being flawless. The added interpretive note introduces unnecessary qualification not present in the ground truth, further deviating from a strict summary.
