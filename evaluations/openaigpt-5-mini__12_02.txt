The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a concise justification that accurately cites the two key counter-examples from the log (C003 with reversed order in lines 6â€“7, and C005 with Validate_Payment in line 11 but no Receive_Order). It matches the ground truth in structure, logic, and essential details, proving the "always follows" claim is invalid. Minor deduction for unnecessarily including line 12 (Cancel_Order) in the C005 reference, which slightly dilutes focus without error, and for phrasing that is a tad less precise (e.g., "appears... with no Receive_Order" vs. ground truth's "contains... but never contains"), but these do not alter the correctness or completeness.
