The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, correctness, and structure (concise bullet points addressing each question precisely). Minor phrasing variations in bullet labels (e.g., "**Distinct cases:**" vs. "**A1:**", restating questions for clarity) and absence of markdown escaping (`Pack_Items` vs. `Pack\_Items`) are stylistic, not substantive errors, warranting no deduction under strict content-focused evaluation. All facts verified correct against the log fragment.
