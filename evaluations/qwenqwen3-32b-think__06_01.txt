8.5

The LLM answer gives both correct pairs, in correct alphabetical order, and uses the proper format—one pair per line, with the requested “Task_X  —  Task_Y” presentation.

However, a strict reading requires that each pair use consistent spacing in alignment with the ground truth—specifically, the second pair in the LLM answer lacks the additional spacing between "Procure_Materials" and "—", as seen in the ground truth ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"). This is a minor formatting inaccuracy, but under the instruction to apply utmost strictness and let even small errors significantly impact the score, this results in a deduction.

Content is perfect; only the small formatting flaw is present. Thus, 8.5 is fair.
