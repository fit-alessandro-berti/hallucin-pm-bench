The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth in content, structure, pair identification, alphabetical ordering (within pairs and overall list), and specified format (one pair per line with "Task_X  â€”  Task_Y"). The minor visual alignment in the ground truth (extra spaces in the second pair for column alignment) is not required by the prompt and does not constitute an error, as the output follows the exact instructions without deviations. No rationale was requested, so its absence is appropriate.
