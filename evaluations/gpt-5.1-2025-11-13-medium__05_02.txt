The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the exact same XML modification as the ground truth (changing `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" for the "Collect Equipment" task), adheres strictly to the rules by modifying only an existing attribute without adding/deleting elements or altering flows, and provides a concise one-sentence rationale that effectively explains the SLA benefit in general terms; however, it loses a full point due to minor differences in rationale specificity (omitting the explicit "3-day SLA" reference and "without introducing any new activities" phrasing, which are present in the ground truth) and a slightly more verbose diff format with unnecessary file headers and extra context lines, deviating from the minimal single-hunk expectation under strict evaluation.
