**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), matching ground truth. Memo format is professional and concise (<200 words). Explanations reference table metrics accurately (e.g., wait times, rework %, SLA breaches, stdev). Recommendations are concrete and data-driven (e.g., automation tied to wait/rework).
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Explanations include speculation not "strictly on the table" (e.g., "manual steps or dependencies," "inexperienced staff," "capacity issues") – violates prompt, unlike ground truth's pure metric focus (-1.0).
  - Misses key metrics emphasized in ground truth: throughput drop (190 for Request_Documents), processing time (25 min, longest for Review_Documents), wait (30 min for Review_Documents), upstream context for Initial_Assessment (-0.5).
  - No closing projection or end-to-end impact summary (-0.2).
  - Minor phrasing less precise (e.g., no "balloons to 150 min" drama or "halves rework" quantifiability).
- Overall: Strong alignment on core task (80%+ match), but strict rubric penalizes non-factual inferences and omissions heavily.
