3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Factual correctness (major deductions)**: 
  - ADDED TASKS: Content fully correct (3 tasks match exactly), +3.0 potential.
  - REMOVED TASKS: Completely incorrect—missed `Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)` (present in v1, absent in v2); false statement "No tasks were removed" adds invalid commentary. 0/3.0.
  - GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES: Only 1/2 correct (`Gateway_ReviewNeeded`); missed `Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel` (v1 exclusiveGateway → v2 parallelGateway). 1.5/3.0.
- **Formatting/Structure (significant deductions)**: Headings verbatim but prefixed with " - " and colons (not in ground truth or prompt verbatim requirement). Bullets use backticks (instruction example has them, but ground truth omits; strict match to ground truth required). Indentation inconsistent. Violates "output must contain only the three required headings and the concrete differences" due to commentary. -2.0 overall.
- **Strictness applied**: Factual misses on "all" changes = ~50% incomplete; small format errors compound to halve remaining points. Total: 3.0 (partial credit for adds and one gateway only).
