### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities as ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment). Explanations cite relevant table metrics (e.g., wait times, processing times, rework, SLA breaches, stdev, throughput drops). Provides one concrete action per activity, data-driven by targeting specific issues (e.g., rework, variability). Concise structure under ~200 words; professional tone.
- **Critical Flaws (major deductions for strictness):**
  - **Factual errors in explanations (significant point loss):** 
    - Request_Documents: Claims "Throughput (190/day) **is the lowest**" – false; Pay_Claim/Notify_Customer at 179/day are lower (table: 179 < 190).
    - Initial_Assessment: Claims "Avg wait time (18 min) **is the second-longest**" – false; Review_Documents at 30 min is second (table order: 150 > 30 > 18).
    These are direct misreads of table data, violating "based strictly on the table."
  - **Speculative causation:** Infers "bottlenecks or inefficiencies in upstream activities (e.g., *Initial_Assessment* or *Check_Coverage*)" for Request_Documents wait – interpretive beyond raw metrics, unlike ground truth's direct metric statements.
  - **Extraneous content:** Unnecessary "Note" praising Pay_Claim/Notify_Customer (~20 words) deviates from task focus on *three worst* only; adds bloat.
  - **Differences from ground truth:** Recommendations similar but less precise/tech-specific (e.g., "audit + checklist" vs. "automatic digital requests"; "decision-tree" vs. "AI-assisted"; no overall projection/impact). Structure more bulleted vs. integrated narrative. Subjective ranking ("Worst Overall").
- **Overall:** Substance ~80% aligned, but factual inaccuracies, extras, and divergences warrant strict penalty (two errors alone deduct ~2.5 pts each from 10). Not hallucination-free or precise per rubric.
