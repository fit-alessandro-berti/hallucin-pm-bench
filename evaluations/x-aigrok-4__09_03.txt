The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in content, accurately identifying the redaction of Artefact A as the core issue, explaining the absence of timestamps and event data needed for "Approve Invoice" durations, and noting the irrelevance of Artefact B. It correctly structures responses to each task (matching the prompt's numbering) and provides a precise, one-paragraph explanation for impossibility without guessing. Minor deductions for slightly different phrasing (e.g., "durations (as complete_time minus start_time)" vs. ground truth's "concrete times"; explicit mention of activity instances) and not ending with a call for additional data, though these do not introduce errors.
