The LLM answer is mostly correct and clearly communicates that the requested metrics cannot be computed due to missing data. It does not attempt to guess or use outside information. However, relative to the ground truth, there are minor flaws:

- The LLM answer gives the impression of answering each task as a numbered bullet, which is slightly less concise than the ground truth's direct statement of impossibility.
- The ground truth more explicitly mentions the complete absence of timestamps for any “Approve Invoice” execution.
- The LLM states "Artefact B provides unrelated metrics on inter-activity times and SLAs, not the intra-activity cycle times needed here," which, while accurate, is less direct and explicit in stating "Additional raw log entries are required."
- The LLM uses "I cannot compute" repeatedly, which is less precise than asserting outright impossibility stemming from the absence of necessary data.

These are fairly minor, but under "utmost strictness," the lack of maximal conciseness, precision, and perfect alignment with the ground truth answer merits a deduction of 2 points.
