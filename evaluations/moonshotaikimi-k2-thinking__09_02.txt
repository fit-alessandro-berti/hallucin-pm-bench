The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt by explaining the impossibility due to missing timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning. Minor deductions for slightly less explicit mention of "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals," which the ground truth includes for fuller precision, but these do not substantially alter the response's validity.
