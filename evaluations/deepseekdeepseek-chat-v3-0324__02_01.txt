The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, with no deviations in values or format. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as an activity that never appears as the first event (it does for case C-77), resulting in an extra and erroneous item in the list. This is a significant factual error under the strict evaluation criteria, warranting a deduction despite the otherwise accurate response. The JSON schema is adhered to correctly overall.
