8.5

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

However, for Q5, the LLM answer includes "Quality_Check" erroneously as a never-first activity. From the log, "Quality_Check" is the first event for case "C-77", so it should not appear in the Q5 list. This is a significant factual error, though the rest are correct (Q5 should contain "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", and "Ship_Order" only, matching the ground truth).

Due to this single, but important, error in Q5, I deduct 1.5 points (strictly: an extra item in the list is a substantial issue given task constraints). Therefore, the answer receives an 8.5/10.
