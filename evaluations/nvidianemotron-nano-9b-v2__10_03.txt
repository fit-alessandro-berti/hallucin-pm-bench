The LLM answer does use the four mandated terms exactly as specified (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) and does not leak any disallowed synonyms. However, there are significant and multiple deviations from the ground truth:

- The LLM matrix omits several required activities: "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" are missing. The instructions specify activities must not be renamed, merged, or omitted, so this is a major error.
- The RACI assignments do not match the ground truth. For example:
    - "Intake Vetting": In the ground truth, Front-Office Analyst is R, A; Compliance Analyst is C; Treasury Ops is I. In the LLM answer, Compliance Analyst is only informed, and Treasury Ops is missing.
    - "KYC Review"/"AML Screening": Compliance Officer should be C, and Treasury Ops should be I. These are not reflected in the LLM answer.
    - "Risk Scoring": LLM has Compliance Analyst as both R and A, and Compliance Officer only as Consulted. In the ground truth, Compliance Analyst is R, Compliance Officer is A, Front-Office Analyst is C, Treasury Ops is I.
- The table structure does not use "R, A" to indicate dual roles, nor does it use dashes to indicate no involvement, as specified.
- The role columns do not match the required format: the ground truth has columns for each role, while the LLM answer groups roles by activity per column, reducing clarity.
- The LLM answer is also missing the required roles in "Consulted" and "Informed" for multiple activities.

Despite using the correct four terms and not leaking synonyms, the LLM answer ignores the requirement not to omit activities, misassigns roles, and misformats the table substantially. These are all critical errors per the instructions and ground truth, warranting a strict, low score.
