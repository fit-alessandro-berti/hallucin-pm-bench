### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit):** The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms exactly as specified (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without any synonyms or leaks. It produces a Markdown table and covers all four roles without renaming or merging. The traditional RACI column structure (Responsible, Accountable, etc.) is a valid format for a RACI matrix, though it differs from the ground truth's role-based columns.
- **Major Weaknesses (significant deductions):** 
  - **Incomplete coverage of activities:** The prompt requires covering "**every activity** described" in the narrative, which includes escalation/Compliance Officer Approval and funds release/notification (Release Funds), for a total of six activities. The LLM only addresses the four mandated ones, ignoring the additional two—directly violating "every activity" while adhering too narrowly to "do not add activities." This is a critical omission, as the ground truth includes them.
  - **Incorrect RACI assignments (multiple errors):** Even for the four shared activities, assignments deviate substantially:
    - Intake Vetting: Misses Compliance Analyst as Consulted (C) and Treasury Ops as Informed (I); incorrectly lists Compliance Analyst as Informed instead.
    - KYC Review: Misses Compliance Officer as Consulted (C) and Treasury Ops as Informed (I).
    - AML Screening: Misses Compliance Officer as Consulted (C) and Treasury Ops as Informed (I).
    - Risk Scoring: Incorrectly assigns Accountable (A) to Compliance Analyst (should be Compliance Officer); misses Front-Office Analyst as Consulted (C); partially correct on Compliance Analyst as Responsible (R), Compliance Officer involvement, and Treasury Ops as Informed (I).
  - **Format inconsistencies:** While Markdown is used, the structure (activity rows with RACI columns) does not match the ground truth's (activity rows with role columns and combined R/A/C/I notations like "R, A"). This leads to less precise representation (e.g., no dashes for no involvement, empty cells instead of explicit "–").
- **Strictness applied:** Small errors (e.g., missing "C" or "I" in specific cells) compound with larger ones (missing activities, wrong Accountable for Risk Scoring), resulting in >50% deviation from ground truth content and structure. No credit for extras since none were added incorrectly, but overall fidelity is low (~40% match on shared elements).
