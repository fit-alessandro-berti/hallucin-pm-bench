The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for all three questions:

- Q1: Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases.
- Q2: Correct sequence for C002: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order.
- Q3: Lists only "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock", alphabetically, as immediate predecessors to "Ship_Order"; activities are named and formatted correctly.

There are no errors or omissions. The answer is fully accurate and precisely follows the instructions, both in content and formatting.
