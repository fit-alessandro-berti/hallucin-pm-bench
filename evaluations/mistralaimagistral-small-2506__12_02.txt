The LLM answer correctly identifies the "No" verdict and accurately highlights the C003 counterexample with precise line citations, matching the ground truth on that point. However, it loses significant points for an imprecise and incomplete explanation of the C005 counterexample: it frames Validate_Payment as merely "preceding Cancel_Order" without explicitly noting the absence of any Receive_Order in that case, which is the critical violation of the "always follows" claim (as emphasized in the ground truth). This omission weakens the justification, introduces an unnecessary and slightly misleading term ("exclusively follow"), and includes extraneous details about positive cases (C001 and C004), which dilute focus and do not align with the ground truth's concise structure. Under strict evaluation, these flaws in clarity, precision, and adherence to the gold-standard reasoning warrant a substantial deduction from a perfect score.
