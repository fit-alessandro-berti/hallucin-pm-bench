2.5

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria)
- **Vocabulary policy (STRICT - core correctness)**: 10/10. All mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") used exactly; no forbidden terms. Row labels match ground truth perfectly.
- **RACI allocations**: 4/10. Responsible (R) positions match exactly (one R per row, aligned to process narrative handlers). However, no Accountable (A) assignments (e.g., AM as A or R/A on Receive Application, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, Notify Customer); no Consulted (C) or Informed (I) anywhere; blanks do not reflect ground truth's full assignments. Misses "AM Accountable where appropriate."
- **Format & Presentation**: 1/10. Headers differ (e.g., "Activities" plural vs. singular "Activity"; extra "(AM)" abbreviations); full-word "Responsible" vs. standard abbreviations (R/A, A, C, I); no bolding on mandated terms or **R**/**R/A**; markdown alignment minorly off with empties.
- **Unwarranted content**: 2/10. No extra tasks/roles/columns (+), but adds legend, introductory sentence, and closing explanation (- major, as ground truth is pure table).
- **Completeness & Fidelity to Ground Truth**: 1/10. Matrix is ~80% divergent (blanks vs. full cells); ignores inferred full RACI logic in ground truth (e.g., CO C on Order Vetting, FC C on KYC Review).
- **Overall**: Major structural/content gaps despite vocab/R basics; strictness demands near-exact match → low score.
