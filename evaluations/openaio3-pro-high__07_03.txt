The LLM answer is content-accurate, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with proper ID-name formatting and no extraneous commentary. However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.0 point for formatting deviations from the ground truth: headings prefixed with "-" (absent in ground truth), and list items lacking bullet points ("-") before each entry, altering the verbatim structure expected. Minor alignment difference in the second gateway line (extra spaces in ground truth) does not penalize the LLM further as it matches the prompt's example format.
