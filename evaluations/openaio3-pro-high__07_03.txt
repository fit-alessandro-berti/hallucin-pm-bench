7.0

- The LLM listed the correct tasks and gateways.
- However, it did not follow the requested format strictly. Specifically:
  - Headings are preceded by a hyphen and a space instead of being plain headings as in the ground truth.
  - Task and gateway entries are missing the leading dashes, making the answer not verbatim with the ground truth and harder to read.
  - For the gateway entries, the ground truth includes alignment with colons and spaces («Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel»), and the LLM used a compressed version losing format fidelity.
- These formatting deviations, though minor in content, are significant per the strictness requested and warrant a noticeable deduction.
