**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Major structural/validity failures (-4.0)**: XML is malformed and invalid BPMN 2.0 (no `<sequenceFlow>` definitions for ~95% of referenced flows; undefined IDs like `wrc_Validate_to_Request_Missing_Info`, `wrc_Check_Warranty_Eligibility`; invalid `<sequence>` elements instead of flat structure; BPMN parsers would reject).
- **Flow logic omissions/hallucinations (-2.5)**: Incomplete/missing "checks warranty eligibility" task (prompt mentions explicitly, ground truth implies via GW but LLM fragments it wrongly); parallel activities modeled as sequential chain post-hallucinated `<sequence>` (-1.0); broken loop (refs dangling, Validate illegally branches without proper GW incoming).
- **Required elements missing (-1.0)**: Exactly **one** end event (wrc_End shared); needs **two** distinct (rejection/success). No proper parallel split/join wiring (joins reference wrong/missing sources).
- **Extra/hallucinated elements (-0.3)**: Unnecessary conditionExpressions/vars; misnamed/misplaced GWs (e.g., wrc_Request_Missing_Info as completeness GW); post-XML explanatory text violates "single self-contained XML".
- **Minor mismatches (-0.2)**: Task names close but not verbatim (e.g., "Validate the claim" vs. "validates the claim"); inconsistent namespaces (no `bpmn:` prefix); process ID lacks "wrc_" prefix.

Semantically non-equivalent: process wouldn't execute as described (no true parallelism, no distinct ends, broken paths). Ground truth is minimal/correct (34 lines, full flows, exact logic). LLM is ~60% broken.
