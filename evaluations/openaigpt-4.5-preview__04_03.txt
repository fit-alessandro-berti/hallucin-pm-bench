6.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the trace is non-compliant due to a violation of Rule 3, notes all four rules individually, and provides a clear explanation for the violation of Rule 3. However, there are significant issues that warrant strict point deductions:

- For **Rule 1**, the LLM answer incorrectly states that this rule is *violated*, suggesting that "RA must occur immediately after QE, before NA," which is not a requirement in the ruleset. Rule 1 specifically requires that QE and RA each occur once and in that order, but does not require them to be consecutive or immediately sequential. In the trace, both QE and RA occur in the correct order, so Rule 1 should be marked as *Satisfied*, not *Violated*. This is a major factual error.
- The explanations for Rules 2, 3, and 4 are accurate and appropriately justified.
- The overall structure of the answer is clear, concise, and addresses each rule directly, which is positive.

Due to the major misinterpretation of Rule 1 (which constitutes a significant substantive error), the score must be capped at 6.0. The rest of the answer is solid, but that misreading is critical in an auditor context. More severe penalty avoided only because the overall non-compliance conclusion is correct and other rule justifications are accurate.
