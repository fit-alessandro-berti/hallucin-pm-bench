**8.5**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable for R1–R6) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are concise (all ≤20 words) and mostly accurate/correctly convey violations.

**Strengths (full points):**
- Exact status alignment.
- Correct overall conclusion.
- R1, R3, R4, R6 justifications equivalent in meaning and correctness.

**Deductions (significant under strictness):**
- R2: Factual error ("4 days after Finance_Approval" is incorrect; ~1 calendar day). Misses key nuance of post-change approval (07-Mar) as "last required approval" (per GT). Wrong reasoning despite correct status (-1.0).
- R5: Partially complete (omits Pay_Invoice/Receive_Goods as further steps before new approval) (-0.2).
- Format: Lacks bolding (**Compliant** etc., per prompt); "NON_COMPLIANT" uses underscore vs. hyphen; no summary of violations (-0.3).

Near-perfect but penalized heavily for R2 inaccuracy and minor format/omissions as instructed.
