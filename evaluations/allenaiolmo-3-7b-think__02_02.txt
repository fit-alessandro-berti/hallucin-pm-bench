The LLM answer is factually perfect with no errors, missing elements, fabrications, or hallucinations across all questions. Q1 matches exactly (3). Q2 sequence is identical. Q3 lists the exact two activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), alphabetically ordered, one per line as prompted. Minor formatting/presentation differences (e.g., extra explanatory text, bolding, no dashes) do not affect factual precision and align with/ exceed the prompt's requirements. Ground truth variations (e.g., dashes, <br>, \_escapes, table format) are stylistic, not substantive discrepancies.
