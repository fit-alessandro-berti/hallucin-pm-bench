### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as specified, with no forbidden terms appearing. It includes all required activities as rows and roles as columns, with no unwarranted additions (e.g., no extra tasks or roles). The structure is a clear RACI matrix with a legend, which is appropriate though not identical to the ground truth format.

However, under utmost strictness, the RACI allocations deviate significantly from the ground truth in multiple cells, introducing errors that misalign with the process narrative:
- **Receive Application**: CO is "I" (incorrect; ground truth "C").
- **KYC Review**: AM is "C" (vs. "A"); CO is "R/A" (vs. "R", treating CO as both without separation); FC is "I" (vs. "C").
- **Order Vetting**: CO is "I" (vs. "C").
- **Payment Clearance**: AM is "I" (vs. "A"); CO is "I" (vs. "C"); FC is "R/A" (vs. "R").
- **Record Update**: AM is "I" (vs. "C"); FC is "I" (vs. "C"); IT is "R/A" (vs. "R").
- **Notify Customer**: Matches fully.

These 8+ discrepancies (including inconsistent handling of "R/A" vs. separate "R" and "A") violate the requirement for precise RACI reflection of the narrative, where each activity must have exactly one Responsible, and Accountable roles are assigned appropriately (e.g., AM as A where narrative implies oversight). Even minor mismatches (e.g., "I" vs. "C", or "R/A" bundling) result in substantial point deductions per the strictness guideline. Approximately 60% of cells match or semi-match, but errors compound to penalize heavily, yielding a low score despite strengths in terminology and format.
