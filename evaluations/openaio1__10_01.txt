7.5

**Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer obeys the strict vocabulary policy without error: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" are used and legacy/forbidden terms do not appear, even in legend or brackets.
- The format (matrix) is valid and standard, activity and roles are clearly labeled.
- No extra activities or roles are introduced.

**Significant Issues & Deductions:**
- R, A, C, I assignments do NOT consistently match the ground truth matrix. There are several mismatches:
  - "Receive Application": The LLM assigns "R/A" to AM (which is fine), but "I" to CO/FC/IT, while the ground truth has CO as "C" and FC as "I", so this is mostly fine, but not perfect—slight issue.
  - "KYC Review": LLM assigns "R/A" to CO, which is close, but ground truth distinguishes A (AM), R (CO), C (FC), I (IT). LLM compresses both R and A into "R/A" for CO, and gives "C" to AM instead of "A", which is inaccurate.
  - "Order Vetting": LLM: AM is "R/A", others "I", while ground truth says CO is "C". LLM omits this consult assignment.
  - "Payment Clearance": LLM makes FC "R/A", ground truth distinguishes "A" (AM), "C" (CO), "R" (FC). LLM misses that AM is "A" and CO is "C".
  - "Record Update": LLM gives "R/A" to IT, all others "I". The ground truth assigns C (AM & FC), I (CO), and R (IT). LLM misses the consult roles.
  - "Notify Customer": "R/A" to AM for both, but ground truth is more detailed, giving I to CO, FC, IT, while LLM mirrors this with "I" for others.

- Most seriously, the LLM consistently omits the "C" (Consulted) role assignments for several activities, reducing the accuracy.
- The legend is appropriate, but it is a minor positive.

**Conclusion:**  
While the special terminology is perfectly obeyed (no deduction here), the *role assignments* are frequently imprecise—especially with missing consult roles—which is a substantive flaw in a RACI context. Since vocabulary policy is the most paramount aspect, the process-mapping accuracy is still highly important and must incur strict penalties as per rubric.

**Therefore, the response deserves a 7.5 out of 10.**
