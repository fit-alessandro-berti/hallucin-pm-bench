The LLM answer fully aligns with the ground truth across all questions, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. Question 1 matches exactly. Question 2 matches the calculation and rounded percentage precisely. Question 3 identifies the sole case correctly. Question 4 provides two valid, clearly stated sampling-related reasons (small sample size with emphasis on statistical insufficiency for rare events, and temporal bias from limited one-day coverage) that directly correspond to ground truth options (small sample size and temporal bias), without straying from the provided log data.
