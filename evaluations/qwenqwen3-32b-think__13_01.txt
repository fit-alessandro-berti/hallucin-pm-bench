9.0

1. The LLM answer is correct for Q1 (“1 time”) and Q3 (only case “A1002”).
2. For Q2, the calculation and result (5.56%) are correct, albeit with a slight difference in rounding/format (writes “5.555...”, but the final answer is “5.56%”). This is identical to the ground truth.
3. For Q4, the model provides (a) “covers only one day...may not reflect monthly patterns,” and (b) “sample size is small (4 cases)...statistically insufficient to generalize.” These both closely match ground truth points (“Temporal bias: short time window,” “Small sample size”). The LLM explicitly mentions "one day," which aligns well with “morning of 1 May 2025” in the ground truth.
4. Slight deductions: The LLM refers to “one day” for temporal bias, but the timestamp range is “morning of 1 May 2025”—so stating “morning” would be slightly more precise.
5. The model does not mention “case-mix bias” or “survivorship/truncation bias,” but only two reasons were required, and the ones chosen clearly match the correct ones. However, it could be slightly more precise regarding event-level statistical impact (the “±5.56 pp” detail).

There are no hallucinations or unjustified extrapolations. The answer format is faithful to the data and instructions. Minor imprecision in wording and omission of some detail costs 1 point.

Final grade: 9.0
