### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (partial credit, ~3/10)**: Correctly identified the two new task IDs (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), but failed to use the exact names from the XML (`Check Customer VIP Status` and `Generate RMA QR Code`) or include IDs with names as in ground truth. Prompt requires "element names exactly as they appear," which includes both ID and name attributes; this is incomplete and non-compliant.
- **Removed tasks (0/10)**: Completely incorrect—listed "(none)" despite clear evidence in XML that `send_rma_label` (name="Send RMA Label") is present in v1 (after `approve_return`, flow to `end`) but absent in v2 (replaced by `generate_qr`). This is a factual omission of a major change, violating the "list only the factual differences" instruction.
- **Gateway type changes (7/10)**: Mostly accurate in identifying `gw_valid` as changing from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`, but formatting is inexact (uses arrow notation vs. ground truth's worded description with versions); headings and bullet style don't match prompt's exact specifications (e.g., "• Added tasks" vs. LLM's "### Added tasks").
- **Overall structure and compliance (-1.0 penalty)**: Headings do not match prompt exactly (e.g., uses "###" and inconsistent bullets instead of "•" prefixed headings). No speculation added, but strictness demands zero tolerance for omissions or formatting deviations. Total reflects ~40% alignment due to the critical removal error outweighing partial successes.
