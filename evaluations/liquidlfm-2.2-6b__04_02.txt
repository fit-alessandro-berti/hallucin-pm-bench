3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Incorrect status (Violated vs. Compliant) and flawed justification (ignores that initial Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval satisfies the rule before the change). Major error: -2 points.
- **R2**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification ignores the change requiring a new "last required approval" on 07-Mar, making Ship_Goods untimely. Major error: -2 points.
- **R3**: Correct status and justification aligns closely with ground truth. No deduction.
- **R4**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Not Applicable); while justification implies no action needed, the status mismatches the precise ground truth categorization. Minor error but strict deduction: -1 point.
- **R5**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification overlooks that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice precede the new Manager_Approval, violating "before any further processing step." Major error: -2 points.
- **R6**: Correct status and justification. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by multiple rule misanalyses. Minor offset: +1 point.

Total: Starting from 10.0, deductions yield 3.0. The LLM misses critical interactions between rules (e.g., R5 impacting R1/R2), leading to systemic inaccuracies despite partial correctness.
