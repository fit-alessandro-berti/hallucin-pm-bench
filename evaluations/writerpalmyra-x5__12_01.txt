**8.0**

The LLM answer correctly concludes inaccuracy with a short justification citing timestamps and activities for Cases 1001 and 1003, accurately showing reversed ordering (counterexamples disproving "always" and "immediately before"). However, it deducts points for:
- Omitting Case 1002 entirely (no `Update_Inventory`, directly disproving "always" per ground truth).
- Lacking ground truth's comprehensive coverage of all three cases, explicit line references, and structured format (bold verdict, bullets, "none of the three cases").
- Minor phrasing differences (narrative vs. bullet-point evidence).

Strict evaluation penalizes incompleteness despite correct core logic.
