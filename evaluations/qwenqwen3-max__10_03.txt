### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks, adhering to the vocabulary policy. However, it fails in multiple critical areas when compared strictly to the ground truth:

- **Activity coverage and naming (major deductions, -3.0 points)**: The prompt requires covering *every activity and role* from the narrative without renaming, merging, or adding activities. The LLM adds interpretive/conditional names (e.g., "Approval (if Risk Scoring > 70)", "Payment Scheduling (if Risk Scoring ≤ 70)", "Funds Release & Notification") that do not match the ground truth's precise, non-conditional names ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). It also introduces a separate "Payment Scheduling" activity, effectively splitting/merging narrative elements (escalation/approval, scheduling/release/notification) in a way that deviates from the ground truth's structure. This adds unauthorized granularity and conditions, violating the "do not rename, merge, or add" rule. The narrative implies distinct but non-conditional steps, which the ground truth captures accurately.

- **RACI assignments (major deductions, -2.5 points)**: Assignments are incomplete and inaccurate across nearly all cells. The LLM assigns only a single role (e.g., "Responsible") per activity with blanks elsewhere, ignoring Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles that the ground truth explicitly includes for cross-role involvement (e.g., Compliance Analyst as C for Intake Vetting; Treasury Ops as I for KYC Review/AML Screening/Risk Scoring). For Risk Scoring, the LLM incorrectly assigns only Compliance as Responsible, omitting ground truth's Officer as Accountable (A), Front-Office as C, and Treasury as I. Approval and release activities similarly lack multi-role nuance (e.g., no I for Front-Office Analyst in approval; no C for Compliance Officer in release). No use of combined notations like "R, A" or dashes (–) for no involvement, leading to implicit but incorrect blanks.

- **Formatting and completeness (minor but strict deductions, -1.0 point)**: Markdown table is basic but lacks ground truth's bolding for activities/roles (e.g., **Intake Vetting**, **R, A**) and structured no-involvement indicators (–). It covers roles but not their full interdependencies as inferred in the narrative (e.g., notifications imply Informed roles). Small errors like inconsistent spacing and verbose activity names compound the deviations.

Overall, while the core vocabulary is handled (partial credit), the matrix does not faithfully represent the process's every activity/role with accurate RACI, resulting in ~70% mismatch in content/structure. Strict evaluation penalizes these comprehensively for incompleteness and inaccuracy.
