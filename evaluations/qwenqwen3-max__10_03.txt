4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt by correctly using the four mandated vocabulary terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) exactly as specified, without any disallowed synonyms leaking in. This earns baseline credit, as it avoids a complete failure on the strict vocabulary policy. However, under utmost strictness, the evaluation reveals numerous significant deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score due to incomplete coverage, inaccuracies, and formatting issues. Small errors (e.g., missing dashes, lack of bolding) compound into major losses, as the prompt demands precise representation of *every* described activity and role in RACI form without adding, renaming, or merging.

#### Key Differences and Point Losses
1. **Activities Covered (Major Deviation, -3.0 points)**:
   - The narrative describes six distinct steps: (1) preliminary assessment (Intake Vetting), (2) CDD (KYC Review), (3) sanctions check (AML Screening), (4) risk rating derivation (Risk Scoring), (5) escalation/Compliance Officer approval, and (6) scheduling/release/notification by Treasury Ops.
   - LLM correctly maps the first four but adds "Payment Scheduling" and "Funds Release," which partially interprets the final steps but *merges and renames* them inaccurately—e.g., it omits the critical "escalation for Compliance Officer approval" as a standalone activity (a key conditional step in the narrative). This violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities" by fabricating names instead of precisely extracting/aligning all described activities (as ground truth does with "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds").
   - Ground truth covers all six without invention; LLM's additions miss the approval escalation, leaving a gap in process coverage.

2. **RACI Assignments (Major Inaccuracies, -2.0 points)**:
   - Assignments are overly simplistic and incomplete, ignoring cross-role involvements implied in the narrative (e.g., file movement implies consultations/informing; notification to "originating analyst" implies Front-Office as Informed).
     - **Intake Vetting**: LLM assigns only "Responsible" to Front-Office Analyst (empty elsewhere). Ground truth adds Accountable to Front-Office, Consulted for Compliance Analyst, Informed for Treasury Ops. Misses nuances.
     - **KYC Review & AML Screening**: LLM assigns only "Responsible" to Compliance Analyst. Ground truth adds Accountable to Compliance, Consulted for Officer, Informed for Treasury Ops and (implicitly) Front-Office. LLM ignores consultations and downstream informing.
     - **Risk Scoring**: LLM assigns Responsible to Compliance Analyst, Accountable to Officer (partially aligns). Ground truth specifies Responsible to Compliance, Accountable to Officer, Consulted to Front-Office, Informed to Treasury Ops. LLM misses Consulted/Informed.
     - Added activities: "Payment Scheduling" (Treasury Responsible only) and "Funds Release" (Treasury Responsible, Front-Office Informed) lack the full RACI depth; ground truth's equivalents include multiple Consulted/Informed roles (e.g., Compliance and Officer as Consulted for Release Funds) and Accountable notations.
   - No use of combined "R, A" notation; empty cells instead of explicit "–" for no involvement, reducing clarity and precision.

3. **Formatting and Presentation (Minor but Strict Errors, -1.0 points)**:
   - Markdown table is produced, but lacks bolding on activity names and R/A cells (as in ground truth for emphasis).
   - Empty cells (e.g., blanks) instead of "–" dashes to denote no involvement, violating the implied precision of ground truth's style.
   - No explanatory notes or keys, though prompt doesn't require them—but ground truth's structure is more professional and aligned.

#### Overall Assessment
The LLM answer demonstrates basic understanding of the vocabulary and core activities but fails to comprehensively map *every* narrative element into a complete, nuanced RACI matrix. It introduces inaccuracies in activity naming/coverage and omits interconnections (e.g., escalations, notifications), resulting in a fragmented representation. With strict grading, this equates to ~40% alignment (correct vocab + partial activities/RACI), hence 4.0. A higher score would require near-exact matching of activities, assignments, and formatting.
