**9.5**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in values, formatting (bold percentages, calculations), and determinism (1 occurrence; 2.08% of 48 events; 8.33% of 12 cases). No inventions or external data used.

For Q3 (≤100 words: LLM uses ~85): Covers required elements—(i) implies single-occurrence via "low-support" and Q1 reference to "once"; (ii) notes instability/skew ("skew the analysis results," "overestimating... frequency"); (iii) cautions over-generalisation ("not... representative," "incorrect conclusions... from this slice"). Insightful on weighting/representativeness aligns with spirit, though ground truth sample is more statistically precise (e.g., explicit "single observation," "noise," "confidence intervals"). Minor phrasing gap deducts 0.5 under utmost strictness; no other errors.
