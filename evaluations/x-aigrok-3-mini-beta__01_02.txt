7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and provides accurate descriptions of their branching logic, aligning closely with the ground truth in substance. The list of required documents is complete and faithful to the prompt's exact wording, which introduces minor phrasing divergences from the ground truth (e.g., including "≤ 3 months old" and "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. the ground truth's shortened "≤ 3 months" and "pay-stub/tax slip"; retaining "(CIS) template" vs. omitting "template"). However, under strict criteria, the following differences warrant deductions:

- **Structure and Formatting (significant loss: -1.0)**: The ground truth uses a precise numbered list with sub-bullets, positioning context (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split," "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), and symbolic notation (e.g., "⇒ continue;"). The LLM uses descriptive paragraphs with bullets and colons, omitting flow positioning and notation, making it less structured and concise.
- **Phrasing Precision (moderate loss: -0.5)**: Slight variations, such as "proceeds to the next step" (Amount Threshold) vs. ground truth's explicit "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval," and unbolded "approve or reject" vs. bolded "**Approve** or **Reject**." Introductory sentences (e.g., "Below is a summary...") add unnecessary verbosity not present in the ground truth.
- **Completeness (minor loss: -0.5)**: Omits the ground truth's explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which reinforces the non-standard process as emphasized in the prompt.
- **Overall Fidelity**: Core content matches 90%+, but strict adherence to the ground truth's exact style, brevity, and details prevents a higher score. No major factual errors, but small inconsistencies in presentation reduce it from excellent.
