**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Quantifies exceedances precisely matching ground truth and table data. Uses bullets *only* for recommendations. Stays grounded in table data (no inventions). Approx. word count similar (~180 vs. ~200).
- **Major failures (significant deductions)**: Lacks executive memo structure (no To/From/Subject, no bolded list format, no "Recommended actions" header, no closing projection/context like "4 805 cases" or cycle time impact). Recommendations are simplistic targets ("cut waiting by Xs") rather than concrete actions (e.g., "introduce pre-checks"); not matching ground truth content. Extra explanatory sentences (e.g., "SLA overage < waiting time") alter flow. Inconsistent number formatting (1,175 vs. 1175). Overall, ~60% structural/content divergence. Strict grading applied.
