- Q1 is correct.
- Q2 is wrong: The correct answer is "Pack_Items" (the event immediately before "Ship_Order" for case C456 in timestamp order), not "Validate_Order".
- Q3 is correct.

Because Q2 contains a fundamental error in event sequence analysis, which is the core analytical skill required, this answer deserves a severe penalty. Minor formatting issues (lack of exact bullet formatting), and not matching the requested conciseness perfectly, lead to further minor loss.
