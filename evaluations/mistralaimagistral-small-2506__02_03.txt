6.0

- Q1 matches the ground truth exactly.
- Q2 is incorrect: the LLM identifies "Validate_Order" as preceding "Ship_Order" for C456, but the ground truth (and chronological sorting of the log) shows "Pack_Items" immediately precedes it at 09:35:00 (before 09:40:00). This is a major factual error, omitting "immediately" and selecting the wrong activity, warranting significant deduction.
- Q3 matches the ground truth exactly ("Cancel_Order" is the only activity appearing once; others like "Create_Order" appear multiple times across cases).
- Minor formatting differences (e.g., "For Qx:" prefixes vs. ground truth's "* A1:" and quotes/escapes) are present but not disqualifying; overall structure is concise and bullet-pointed as requested.
