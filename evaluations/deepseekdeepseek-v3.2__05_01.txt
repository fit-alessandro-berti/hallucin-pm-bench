**4.0**

### Evaluation:
- **Major functional error (-4.0 points)**: Suggests **non-interrupting** timer boundary event, vs. ground truth's **interrupting** timer. Non-interrupting spawns parallel execution without canceling `Task_Receive`, failing to properly bypass/escalate (e.g., claim could continue to `Task_Check`/`Task_RequestDocs` post-timer, duplicating paths and violating SLA enforcement).
- **Missing precision (-1.5 points)**: No ID for timer (ground truth: `id="Timer_48h"`); vague "48-hour duration" vs. BPMN-standard `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`. No explicit new `sequenceFlow` ID.
- **Minor issues (-0.5 points)**: Less emphasis on bypassing docs; casual phrasing omits XML-like detail.
- **Positives (+2.0 points)**: Correct attachment to `Task_Receive`, target `Task_Triage`, new flow concept, ≤120 words, no new tasks, references existing IDs.

Overall, captures high-level idea but critical BPMN inaccuracies make it non-compliant.
