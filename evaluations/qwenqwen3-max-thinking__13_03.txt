**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (40% weight)**: Exact match ("once" ≡ "1"), no errors. Perfect (10/10).
- **Q2 (60% weight)**: Core ideas overlap (small sample of 3 cases, non-representative, naming variants obscuring patterns), but strict differences deduct heavily:
  - Misses quantitative precision: 14 events, <2h span, frequency swing (0%–7%), wide CI, explicit rare-event sampling error (–2.0 pts).
  - No restatement of occurrence details (case/time) as in GT (–0.5 pts).
  - Minor speculation ("batched manual reviews" not data-supported; violates "no speculation") (–0.3 pts).
  - Vaguer phrasing vs. GT's analytical depth (e.g., "strict string matching excludes... fuzzy may over-include") (–0.5 pts).
  - Under 120 words: compliant.
  
  Subtotal: ~6.9/10 → **Overall: 7.2** (strong but incomplete fidelity to GT's rigor).
