**10.0**

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in verdict ("No/not accurate" vs. "inaccurate"), structure (case-by-case evidence with sequences/ordering), key observations (reversal in 1001/1003, absence in 1002 disproves "always"), and conclusion (no instance of claimed ordering). It strictly bases claims on data, cites cases/activities/timestamps precisely, remains concise, and adds no unsubstantiated info. No errors or deviations warrant deduction under strict evaluation.
