**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and properly assesses Rules 2, 3, and 4 with accurate status and reasoning. However, it commits a major factual error by incorrectly marking **Rule 1 as "Violated"** (with a justification that confuses it with Rule 3's NA timing issue), while the ground truth correctly marks Rule 1 as "✔ Satisfied" since QE precedes RA and both occur once. This misassessment introduces a false violation, misparaphrases the rule violation logic, and deviates significantly from the ground truth's per-rule breakdown. Format is similar (bullets vs. table) but lacks the explicit symbols (✔/❌), overall summary phrase, and precise phrasing (e.g., no "Severity is High" note). Under utmost strictness, this core error on one of four rules (25% wrong) plus justification flaws warrants substantial deduction from a perfect score.
