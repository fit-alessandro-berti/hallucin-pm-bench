2.5

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth and prompt requirements by inventing an extra task (t6, a duplicate "Resolve Issue" after "Forward to Specialist"), which adds an unmentioned activity and alters the flow—violating the strict "do not invent or add activities" rule. This constitutes a major hallucination, as the ground truth correctly merges the "Resolve Issue" into a single task (t4) shared across paths, reflecting the description's use of the same activity name without duplication. The specialist path (t5 → t6 vs. ground truth's t5 → t4) introduces unnecessary redundancy.

Additional strict deductions for:
- Incorrect task name ("Classify Ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification," ignoring "automatically" from line 2: -0.5).
- Fabricated condition expressions with invented variables (e.g., `category == "Password Reset"`, `canResolveDirectly == true`) vs. ground truth's simple "yes"/"no" (-0.5).
- Process attributes mismatch (id="supportTicketProcess" without name; isExecutable="true" vs. ground truth's "false" and named process: -0.5).
- Missing XML declaration and descriptive names on start/end/gateways (ground truth includes them for fidelity: -0.5).
- Minor XML issues (extra xmlns:xsi; no targetNamespace; late gw3 definition after reference: -0.25).

The core flow (including loop to t3) and two main gateways are partially correct, but the addition of a third explicit task for resolution prevents a higher score. Total differences warrant a low grade under utmost strictness.
