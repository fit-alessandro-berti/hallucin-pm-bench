The LLM answer correctly identifies the non-compliance status and accurately pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with relevant event citations, aligning with the ground truth's core reasoning. However, it deducts points for: (1) incomplete coverageâ€”failing to evaluate all rules (1, 4, and 5 are satisfied but unmentioned, unlike the ground truth's comprehensive check); (2) minor formatting deviations (e.g., "Rule 2(b)" notation not matching the prompt's structure; "Justifications" plural vs. singular "Justification"; lacks overall summary sentence); and (3) a small factual error in Rule 3 justification ("positions 7 and 8 intervene" omits position 9, understating the distance overrun from 3 to 4 intervening activities). These differences, though not fatal, warrant a strict deduction from a perfect score under the evaluation criteria.
