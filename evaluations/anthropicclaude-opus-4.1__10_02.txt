### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt by correctly incorporating the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and producing a Markdown RACI table that attempts to map the source text's steps. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs significant point deductions for multiple deviations from the ground truth:

- **Structural and Completeness Errors (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: Missing the "Operations Manager" role/column, which is central to the ground truth's RACI assignments (handling most "A" responsibilities). This fundamentally alters the matrix's logic, as accountability is incorrectly reassigned (e.g., to "Regulatory Liaison" or via "R/A" shorthands). Extra task ("Ensure SWIFT message transmission") not present in ground truth, inflating the table to 7 rows vs. 6. Unnecessary title/subtitle ("# AtlasRemit Process RACI Matrix ## Cross-Border Payment Processing") and non-standard header ("Task" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"). Legend includes unauthorized "R/A" explanation, absent in ground truth.

- **Task Wording and Mapping Errors (moderate deduction: -1.5 points)**: Most tasks deviate from ground truth phrasing (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**" with bold; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"; "Approve high-risk transaction" lacks plural "Transactions"). Fails to emphasize mandated wording explicitly. SWIFT handling is split incorrectly, not combined into "Release Payment" as implied in ground truth.

- **RACI Assignments Errors (major deduction: -0.5 points)**: Near-total mismatch due to missing role. Examples: "Receive" lacks "A" (Operations Manager) and "C" (IT Support); "Screen" has incorrect "I" for Operations Manager equivalent; "KYC Review" combines "R/A" instead of separate "R" (Regulatory Liaison) and "A" (Operations Manager), with wrong "I" for IT Support; "Archive" lacks "A" (Operations Manager) and has "I" for Transaction Analyst instead of "C". Even minor cells (e.g., "I" for Regulatory Liaison in several tasks) align sporadically but are undermined by omissions.

Positive aspects (e.g., correct role mappings for Transaction Analyst and Regulatory Liaison, full coverage of source steps without omissions) prevent a total failure score but do not offset the cumulative differences. Overall fidelity to ground truth is low (~40%), warranting a failing-to-marginal grade.
