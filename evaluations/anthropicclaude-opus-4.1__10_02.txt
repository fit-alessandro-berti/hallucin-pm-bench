6.0

Analysis:

**Vocabulary Adherence:**  
- Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst".  
- Never uses forbidden synonyms—good.

**Tasks/Activities Wording & Mapping:**  
- The LLM answer invents these step names (not verbatim from mandate, but paraphrases understandably and does bold terms where appropriate).
- "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" is valid.
- However, the sequence "Ensure SWIFT message transmission" and "Archive case file" diverge in wording from the ground truth, which expects "Release Payment" and "Archive Record".
- "Operations Manager" is omitted entirely as a column—ground truth explicitly includes it as Accountable on every step.

**Role Assignment:**  
- Misses the "Operations Manager" role.
- Frequently combines R/A (Responsible & Accountable) for same actor (e.g., Regulatory Liaison for "KYC Review") while the ground truth splits A to Operations Manager and R to the correct party.
- The assignments for "Screen against sanctions" show Regulatory Liaison as Accountable, which matches, but also as both Accountable and Responsible in some steps, which is a deviation.
- At least one questionable mapping: e.g., Transaction Analyst is "Consulted" for SWIFT message transmission? The ground truth does not assign Consulted to this actor for that activity.
- The "Informed" and "Consulted" assignments deviate from ground truth in several places.

**Format:**  
- Markdown table present, with legend—good.
- The ground truth is strictly structured, faithfully maps each activity to a mandated phrase, and is explicit about role assignment.

**Summary of Losses:**  
- Major points off for omission of the "Operations Manager" column.
- Minor to moderate points off for some task name paraphrasing instead of using process-mandated or ground truth terms exactly.
- Moderate points off for role mapping inaccuracies (R/A confusion, several misassigned C and I).
- Adequate markdown formatting and some appropriate bolding.

**Strict Scoring Justification:**  
- Omission of a mandated actor (Operations Manager) is a major flaw (3+ points off alone).
- Multiple small differences in role assignment and task phrase wording add up to a significant further deduction.
- The final result is clear, but not strictly in line with the instructive standard.

**Final:**  
**6.0** — Substantial, but incomplete and inaccurate relative to a gold-standard answer.
