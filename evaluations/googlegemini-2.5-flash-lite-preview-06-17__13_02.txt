The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on all numeric questions:

1. Correctly states that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time.
2a. Calculates 1/48 = 2.08%, matching the ground truth.
2b. Calculates 1/12 = 8.33%, matching the ground truth.

For part 3, the LLM's short explanation meets the requirements:
- It notes the single-occurrence issue ("only once in this small sample").
- Mentions potential skew/instability in statistics ("overestimate its frequency or impact...skew performance metrics...models unreliable...not be representative").
- Warns explicitly against generalization and describes why conclusions are unreliable.

No missing elements or errors. This is a faithful, precise, and sufficiently cautious answer with no invented information.
