10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match the deterministic calculations precisely (2.08% and 8.33%, with correct rounding to two decimals). Question 3 adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (85 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue (e.g., "appearing only once," "rare occurrence," "single instance"), notes variance/instability (e.g., "disproportionately skew performance metrics," "unreliable" models, "not...representative"), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "might overestimate its frequency or impact," "mislead analyses"). No deviations from ground truth criteria or invention of data.
