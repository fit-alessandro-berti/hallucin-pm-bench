The LLM answer fails completely against the ground truth: (1) malformed/invalid unified diff hunk that duplicates lines and wouldn't patch correctly; (2) modifies the wrong element (GrantAccess serviceTask) by adding a non-ground-truth attribute (camunda:topic) instead of changing dueDate on CollectEquipment userTask; (3) entirely different rationale unrelated to reducing dueDate for SLA cycle time.
