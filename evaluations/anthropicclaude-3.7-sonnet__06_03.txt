9.5

The LLM answer is accurate and meets the user's requirements: it correctly identifies the two sets of tasks that can execute concurrently in Process B, numbers and labels the sets in the order they appear, and provides no extraneous information about Processes A or C.

**Minor deviation:**  
- The answer slightly elaborates ("These two sets represent the tasks...") instead of strictly listing with minimal phrasing as seen in the ground truth. Also, it uses headings ("# Concurrent Task Sets...") and bolded section titles ("## Set 1...") instead of directly numbering as in the ground truth ("1. **Set 1...**").
- The use of markdown and section headers is functionally equivalent but not exactly matching the style or formatting of the ground truth (e.g., no use of â€– operator).

Due to strictness in style and the instruction that small errors should result in a significant point loss, the answer receives a deduction for format and minor verbosity.  
**Final score:** 9.5
