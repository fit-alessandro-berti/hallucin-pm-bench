**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high marks basis)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), ranked identically. Explanations are **strictly table-based** (e.g., wait times, processing time, stdev, rework %, SLA % cited accurately; no hallucinations or absent activities). Actions are concrete, data-driven (tied to specific metrics like rework, variability, queues). Concise (<200 words), executive memo format. No guessing on ambiguous rankings—clear differentiation exists.
- **Deductions (-0.8 total)**:
  - **Minor emphasis omissions** (-0.3): Misses key throughput drop (190 cases/day) for Request_Documents (ground truth leads with it as bottleneck signal); omits Review_Documents' 30-min wait queue (ground truth highlights as exacerbator).
  - **Slight interpretive overreach** (-0.2): Groups all three under "document lifecycle," but Initial_Assessment isn't document-related (sequence/context mismatch).
  - **Less precise actions/projection** (-0.3): Actions solid but vaguer/less measurable (e.g., "audit...aiming to drastically reduce" vs. ground truth's "halve rework"; no end-to-end projection like "lift throughput ≈10%, reduce SLA >40%").
  
Near-perfect alignment (92% match on structure/content/accuracy), but strict rubric penalizes all variances despite validity.
