The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 (perfect accuracy on these). For Q5, it correctly identifies three activities that never appear as the first event ("Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") but erroneously includes an extra one ("Quality_Check"), which does appear as the first event in case C-77. This is a clear factual error, violating the strict requirement to use only directly readable facts from the log. Under utmost strictness, this single but significant discrepancy in one question (adding incorrect content to the list) warrants a deduction, but the overall response retains strong fidelity to the ground truth, justifying a high score rather than a failure.
