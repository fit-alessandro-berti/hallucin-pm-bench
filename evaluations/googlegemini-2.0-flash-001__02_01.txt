8.0

The LLM answer is almost correct but with a small error in Q5. It incorrectly lists "Quality_Check" as never appearing as the first event of any case, which is not the case (C-77 starts with Quality_Check in the fragment). Otherwise, all other responses exactly match the ground truth.

The error in Q5 is significant as the instructions explicitly require that only facts visible in the fragment be used, and Quality_Check as a first activity is plainly present for case "C-77." Such a factual slip merits a strict points deduction in line with your instruction, but as the answer overall is almost entirely correct, a score of 8.0/10 is fitting.
