The LLM answer proposes the identical XML modification (changing `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" on `Task_CollectEquipment`), adheres strictly to rules (one attribute change, no add/delete, single hunk unified diff), and provides a concise one-sentence rationale. Minor deductions for: (1) extraneous unified diff headers (`--- a/... +++ b/...`) and specific line numbering/context lines not matching the ultra-minimal ground truth hunk format (-0.4); (2) differing rationale wording ("critical path...access provisioning...likelihood of meeting 'Ready to Work' SLA" vs. "keeps...inside the contractual 3-day SLA without introducing any new activities," introducing unmentioned "critical path" phrasing while omitting explicit "no new activities" reassurance and assuming unsubstantiated "3-day SLA") (-0.3); (3) curly quotes and lack of bold formatting (-0.1).
