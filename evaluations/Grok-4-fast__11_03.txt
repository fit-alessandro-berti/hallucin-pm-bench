### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core requirements: it correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches (all quantified accurately as +300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). It grounds descriptions in table data (e.g., throughput/waiting times, case volumes) without inventing absent activities or metrics. The memo is concise (~148 words, near 150 target), uses bullet points exclusively for the three concrete, data-driven recommendations (referencing case counts and excesses), and maintains an executive tone focused on inefficiencies.

Minor deductions for strictness: 
- Formatting differences (e.g., includes a bold title, date "September 19, 2025" not in data, word count footer; lacks subject line present in ground truth; "From" phrasing varies slightly).
- Recommendations differ in specifics (e.g., triage queue vs. pre-checks; additional reviewers vs. one analyst + automation; automate scoring vs. straight-through heuristic), introducing invented elements like 50%/40% reductions (though data-driven via excesses/cases; ground truth similarly invents "â‚¬25k," "one analyst," "35%"). These are small creative variances but reflect in point loss per instructions.
- Slight inferential phrasing (e.g., "delaying overall disbursement," "without new resources") echoes ground truth's implications but adds unsubtle inventions.

Overall, high fidelity to prompt and ground truth, with differences not undermining data-grounded accuracy.
