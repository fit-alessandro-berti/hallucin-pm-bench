8.0

The LLM answer is broadly accurate and closely follows the data and structure required by the prompt, but a number of small but meaningful differences and errors prevent full marks:

Positives:
- Correctly identifies Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment as the three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches and long waiting times.
- Quantifies the SLA breaches precisely for all three activities.
- Recommendations are data-driven and limited to provided information.
- Follows instructions on bullet points for recommendations.
- No mention of unlisted activities or extraneous metrics.
- Memo length and executive style are appropriate.

Strict Deficits and Errors:
- The LLM memo’s recommended actions are less precise/targeted than the ground truth; they are more generic and do not utilize specific numeric insights or unique process suggestions as in the ground truth (e.g., "triage queue" vs. "rule-based pre-checks", "additional reviewers" vs. "add one risk analyst to the peak morning window").
- The LLM answer proposes "prioritize cases ... by implementing a triage queue", "allocate additional reviewers", and "automate initial scoring"—but these lack the operational specificity (like "loans under €25k", "automate external score retrieval") seen in the ground truth.
- The LLM memo refers to "aiming to cut 480s waiting by 40%" for Risk Review. This percentage reduction target is not grounded in supplied data. Similarly, "targeting a 50% reduction in wait" for Legal Approval is not included in the provided data or ground truth, thereby slightly breaching the instruction not to invent metrics or goals.
- The closing sentence "This will enhance cycle times without new resources" is partially speculative; the resource implication in the recommendations (e.g., "allocate additional reviewers") could, in fact, require more resources.
- Some numeric phrasing in the recommendations (e.g. "waiting by 40% based on current throughput") is confusing or formulaic, without clear grounding in the data.

Summary: The LLM answer matches very well in structure and high-level content, but a handful of imprecisions, invented improvement targets, and recommendations less concretely grounded in the supplied details justify a 2-point deduction for strictness.
