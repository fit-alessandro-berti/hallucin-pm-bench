9.0

**Justification:**

- **Q1:** Correct. "3" is given, matching the ground truth.
- **Q2:** Correct. The sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" is correct and matches exactly.
- **Q3:** Minor Error. The LLM answer lists "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" (correct activities), but omits the required underscores ("Arrange\_Delivery" and "Check\_Stock"). The ground truth shows these activities with underscores, which matches the formal notation as per the original event log and prompt. Given the strict grading criterion ("Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points"), missing the exact activity names as present in the data is a notable precision error, as these represent formal identifiers and not merely natural-language terms.

**Point deduction:**  
The content is correct, but the formatting is not precise to the data, so -1 point.

**Final score:** 9.0
