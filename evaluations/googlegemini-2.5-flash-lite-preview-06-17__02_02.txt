The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, structure, and factual accuracy across all questions. Q1 is identical (3). Q2 sequences the activities precisely as specified, using the correct separator and order without deviations. Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) one per line in alphabetical order, fully aligning with the prompt and ground truth (minor presentational differences like bullets in ground truth vs. plain lines do not constitute errors, as the required output format is "one per line"). No hallucinations, omissions, or inaccuracies detected.
