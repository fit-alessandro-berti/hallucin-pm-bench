The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it answers "No" to Question 1 (ground truth: "Yes") and provides a flawed explanation for Question 2 that ignores the parallel path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) enabling T5 without T3. This inverts the core conclusion, misrepresents dependencies (e.g., claiming T7 requires T3), and fails to provide the required firing sequence. No alignment with ground truth; major errors warrant minimal score.
