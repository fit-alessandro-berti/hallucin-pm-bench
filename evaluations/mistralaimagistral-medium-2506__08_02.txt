2.0

**Justification:**

- The LLM answer gets the primary question (**Q1**) wrong: it declares it is **not possible** for T5 to fire before T3, while the ground truth shows it **is possible**.
- The explanation is logically flawed, incorrectly insisting that T3 must fire before T5. It misunderstands the net structure by claiming P5 depends on T4 via P4, "which depends on T3", ignoring the path via T7 (i.e., T2→T7→T4 can reach P4 and P5 without T3 ever firing).
- The bonus question (**Q2**) is also wrong, as it asserts "no firing sequence exists" when a minimal sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) in the ground truth clearly demonstrates one.
- There are no correct elements—the LLM only correctly references some net structure (e.g., the requirement for tokens in P2 and P5 for T5 to fire), but the reasoning is fatally flawed and the central conclusion is wrong.
- Because the answer is wholly incorrect, but demonstrates *some* knowledge of the individual Petri net elements, a score above 1.0 is justified. However, strict rubric demands a very low score due to the incorrect core claim and explanation.

**Final score: 2.0**
