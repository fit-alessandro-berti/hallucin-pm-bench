The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B, lists them in the required alphabetical order (both overall and within pairs), and uses the specified format with one pair per line. Task names are accurate and unchanged. Minor deduction for the unrequested introductory text, which deviates from the prompt's strict output instructions (implying a clean list without preamble), and slight spacing misalignment in the second pair relative to the ground truth's aligned presentationâ€”per strict evaluation criteria, these represent small but notable formatting/output compliance errors. No other content errors or inclusion of Process A.
