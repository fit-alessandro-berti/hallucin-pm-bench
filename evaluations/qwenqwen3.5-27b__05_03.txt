9.2

The LLM answer is functionally identical and fully compliant with the task (adds only a timer boundary event and sequence flow to the existing unused escalation activity, no new activities), with valid BPMN 2.0 XML that correctly enforces the SLA from approximately the end of Verify Identity. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (stylistic inconsistency with original XML and ground truth, -0.3); (2) no `name="48h breach"` attribute (-0.2); (3) absent explanatory comments and ```xml``` wrapper (-0.1); (4) different arbitrary IDs (neutral); (5) justification wording similar but not verbatim (e.g., "Timer Boundary Event" vs. "boundary timer", misses explicit "without introducing any new activities" and bolded task names, -0.2).
