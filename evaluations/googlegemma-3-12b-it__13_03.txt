### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1 (Count)**: Perfect match—correctly identifies exactly one occurrence. No errors. (10/10)
- **Question 2 (Explanation)**: Addresses the core issue of small sample size and non-representativeness, staying within word limit and data-focused. However, it speculates on "overestimate" direction without evidence (ground truth emphasizes bidirectional misestimation via sampling swings). Misses key analytical depth: quantitative details (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours, 0-7% frequency swing, wide confidence intervals, rare-event sampling error) and the critical process-mining nuance of near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) causing string-matching distortions. These omissions make it less precise and insightful for a senior analyst, leading to point deductions despite brevity. (5/10, averaged for significance)  
Overall: Strong on facts, weak on rigorous analysis—strictly, this halves the explanation score.
