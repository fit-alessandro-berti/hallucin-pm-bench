The LLM answer is concise, directly addresses the prompt's requirement for a one-sentence explanation when the value cannot be determined, and correctly identifies the core issue (lack of time-related data). It loses a full point due to slightly less precise phrasing compared to the ground truthâ€”e.g., it omits explicit mention of "duration information," "event counts," and "start-to-completion intervals," opting instead for broader "time-related information" and "artefacts," which are accurate but not as detailed or explanatory.
