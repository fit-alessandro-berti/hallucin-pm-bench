6.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Decision Points (major errors, ~50% weight, score impact: -3.5)**: 
  - LLM lists **4 points** vs. GT's **3**, incorrectly including **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** as a decision point (GT omits it entirely, as it's a procedural step, not a branching decision).
  - **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: Incomplete/missing key details from GT ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"; exact names "Senior Underwriter A" and "Shadow Underwriter B"; full "escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break").
  - **Amount Threshold Decision**: Minor omissions (GT specifies "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"; "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" vs. LLM's "escalate to Board").
  - **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: Mostly matches but adds unnecessary "applications ≥ €15 000".
  - Uses activity names correctly but introduces extraneous content and wrong count/structure.

- **Required Documents (minor errors, ~50% weight, score impact: -0.3)**:
  - Lists all **6 exact items** matching prompt/system, but small wording deviations: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"; unnumbered bullets vs. GT's numbered list.
  - Omits GT's extraneous note ("*(No credit bureau...)*"), which is not required by prompt but contributes to format mismatch.

- **Overall Structure/Compliance**: Headers differ (### vs. ####); LLM adds descriptive phrasing not in GT (e.g., "Decision on whether..."). Violates "summarise" precision and "use exactly the activity names" by expanding incorrectly. No standard terminology introduced, but strictness demands near-exact match to GT.

Base 10.0 minus deductions for differences yields 6.2. Significant losses for extra/wrong decision point and incompleteness despite strong document match.
