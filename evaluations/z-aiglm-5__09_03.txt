The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in core reasoning (impossibility due to redacted timestamps/rows in Artefact A; need for start/complete times specific to "Approve Invoice"; no computation of average cycle time, std dev, or 95% CI possible). Strengths: Explicitly lists all requested metrics verbatim, precisely explains Artefact B's irrelevance (historical throughput between activities ≠ activity duration), uses one short paragraph, no guessing. Minor deductions (-0.8 total): Slightly longer/more verbose phrasing vs. ground truth's concise "Impossible —" opener; adds "for every instance" (accurate but extra detail); backticks on column names (unnecessary formatting); omits explicit call for "additional raw log entries" (helpful suggestion in ground truth). No major errors, but strict evaluation penalizes non-identical structure/wording.
