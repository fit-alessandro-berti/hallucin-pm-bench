4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Decision Points (Partial Credit: ~7/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies the three core decision points and their outcomes using the exact activity names (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)"). It accurately describes the score difference threshold (≤ 2 points), escalation to Harmonisation Committee, auto-approval vs. board review based on amount, and board vote (approve/reject). However, it introduces minor inaccuracies and extras not in the ground truth: (1) specifies continuation "to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" explicitly, which is implied but not phrased that way; (2) uses "proceed to" instead of "send to" for MBA; (3) adds "mandatory for amounts ≥ €15 000" as an explanatory parenthetical, which is accurate but extraneous and deviates from the ground truth's concise description; (4) omits contextual "branches after" references (e.g., after Dual Underwriter Split or after NFC), making it less precise on process flow. Capitalization inconsistencies (e.g., "approve" vs. "Approve") are small but penalized under strictness.

- **Required Documents (Low Credit: ~2/10)**: This section has critical errors. The ground truth lists all six documents explicitly as required at submission time, with minor phrasing variations (e.g., "≤ 3 months" vs. "≤ 3 months old"; "pay-stub/tax slip" vs. "single pay-stub or tax slip"; "CIS" vs. "(CIS) template"). The LLM omits two entirely—**Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet** and **Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)**—claiming they are "generated during the process" (steps 4 and 6), which directly contradicts the system's "Required documents at submission time" list that includes them. This is a major factual deviation, as the user prompt demands "**every required document**" per the provided list. The added note on generation timing and "no credit history documents" introduces non-ground-truth content (though the latter aligns with process notes, it's not part of the exact list). Even the included four documents have slight phrasing differences, compounding the loss.

- **Overall Structure and Adherence (Partial Credit: ~4/10)**: The LLM uses clear headings and bullet points, adhering to "exact terminology" and avoiding standard loan terms, which matches the prompt. However, it adds interpretive notes (e.g., ⚠️ Note) that alter the response's neutrality and completeness, straying from the ground truth's straightforward lists. No introduction of forbidden terminology, but the document omission is a severe non-compliance with "list every required document."

This score reflects strict penalization: decision points are 80% aligned but lose points for phrasing extras; documents are ~33% complete with disqualifying omissions and rationale, dragging the total down significantly.
