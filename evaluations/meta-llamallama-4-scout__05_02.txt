2.0

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple ways:

**Major Issues:**
- The ground truth requires a _single attribute change_ (the `camunda:dueDate` of the `Task_CollectEquipment` userTask from `P5D` to `P2D`). The LLM answer instead proposes a complex modification of sequence flows and, in its first response, even rewires the process, which is out of scope according to the instructions (no activities may be added/deleted, only a single attribute change or one sequence flow direction may be modified).
- The LLM's "valid response" attempts to modify sequence flow sources and due dates, but this is not the minimal, most direct improvement to SLA compliance, which would be just reducing the task due date.
- The diff in the LLM answer is not a valid, minimal unified diff changing only an attribute; it changes the control flow and introduces potential BPMN semantic issues.

**Minor Issues:**
- The rationale is not concise, and somewhat abstract—while the instructions call for a one-sentence, concrete rationale (the ground truth provides: “Reducing the **Collect Equipment** due-date from 5 days to **2 days** keeps the overall onboarding cycle inside the contractual 3-day SLA without introducing any new activities.”).

**Conclusion:**
- There is little overlap with the ground truth: the key point is to reduce the due date, not to modify sequence flows. The LLM missed the simplest and most compliant solution.
- Only a 2.0 is warranted—it attempted to improve SLA and referenced due dates, but did not meet the task constraints or requirements in any meaningful way.
