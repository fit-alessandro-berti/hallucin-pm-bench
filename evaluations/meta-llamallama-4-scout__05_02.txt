The LLM answer fails to match the ground truth entirely: it proposes invalid sequence flow modifications that violate BPMN structure and the rules (e.g., incorrect source/target refs, incomplete hunk, potential addition of new flows), provides a garbled and non-functional diff instead of a simple single-hunk attribute change, includes extraneous analysis outside the required format, and offers an irrelevant rationale focused on parallelism rather than due-date reduction for SLA compliance.
