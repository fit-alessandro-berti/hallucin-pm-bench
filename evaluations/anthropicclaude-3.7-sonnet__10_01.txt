4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Strict Policy Compliance)**: Perfect (10/10). All mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are used exactly as specified with correct capitalization. No forbidden terms appear anywhere.
- **Structure and Format**: Mostly correct but with minor deviations (7/10). The matrix uses rows for activities and columns for roles, as required. However, headers include abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") not present in the ground truth, adding unwarranted detail. The use of "-" for blanks is inconsistent with the ground truth's explicit "I" or "C" fillings. Extra elements like the title, legend, and note introduce unwarranted content, violating the "no extra tasks, roles, or columns" rubric aspect (though no new rows/columns are added).
- **RACI Allocations Correctness**: Poor (2/10). Significant deviations from the ground truth and process narrative:
  - Responsible (R) assignments are mostly accurate (one per row, aligning with primary handlers: AM for Receive/Order/Notify; CO for KYC; FC for Payment; IT for Record). However, this is undermined by failures elsewhere.
  - Accountable (A) roles are entirely missing (no "A" or "R/A" markings), despite the ground truth assigning A to AM for Receive, Order Vetting, Payment, and Notify, and to AM for KYCâ€”critical for reflecting narrative accountability (e.g., AM's overarching role).
  - Consulted (C) and Informed (I) are frequently incorrect or omitted: e.g., Receive Application has CO as I (GT: C), FC/IT as - (GT: I); KYC Review has AM as C (GT: A), FC as - (GT: C), IT as - (GT: I); Payment Clearance has AM as I (GT: A), CO as I (GT: C), IT as - (GT: I); Record Update has CO as - (GT: I), FC as I (GT: C); Notify Customer has CO/IT as - (GT: I). These errors misrepresent consultations and updates implied in the workflow (e.g., Compliance Officer involvement post-documents).
  - No bolding for emphasis on R/A as in ground truth, reducing clarity.
- **Overall Fidelity to Ground Truth and Narrative**: Low due to pervasive cell-level differences (nearly every row has 2-4 mismatches). While the core process steps are covered without extras, the RACI does not "reflect the narrative" fully, especially on accountability and secondary roles. Strict rubric application: Multiple small-to-medium errors (e.g., missing I/C, no A) compound to major inaccuracies, warranting heavy deduction.
- **Unwarranted Content**: Minor infractions via title/legend/note, but not severe (8/10 deduction impact).
- **Total Score Rationale**: Weighted heavily toward correctness (50%), with vocabulary as a saving grace. Strictness applied: The matrix is recognizable but functionally flawed, leading to a mid-low score rather than failing entirely.
