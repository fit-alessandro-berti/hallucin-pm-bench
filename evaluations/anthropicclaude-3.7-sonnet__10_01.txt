6.5

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer strictly uses the mandated terminology: “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance”. No forbidden terms are present.
- The structure and format are correct; only the specified activities and roles are included.
- No extraneous content is added.

**Major Issues:**
- **Incorrect RACI assignments** compared to the ground truth. Notably:
  - No use of A (Accountable) in the table, unlike the model where several steps have “R / A” or A for Account Manager (most steps should have an “A” in the AM column).
  - The LLM sometimes assigns R and C interchangeably (e.g., assigns Order Vetting R to AM and C to CO; ground truth gives R/A to AM and C to CO, but no A explicitly listed in the matrix).
  - Informing roles: The LLM puts “-” for many non-involved roles where the ground truth has “I”, significantly under-accounting for stakeholders who need to be informed.
  - Additional small mismatches in the “C” (Consulted) and “I” (Informed) assignments for a few steps (e.g., “Record Update” and “Notify Customer”).

**Minor Issues:**
- The LLM only provides one letter per intersection, missing dual assignments like “R / A” (e.g. in
the ground truth, AM is both Responsible and Accountable in several steps).

**Overall:**
- No direct forbidden vocabulary mistakes, but the strictness required means the missing or incorrect R/A/C/I assignments, especially the lack of any “A”, and the underreporting of “I”, result in a significant penalty.
- The mistakes are systematic and degrade the accuracy of the RACI matrix. Each step deviating from the ground truth should result in a notable mark-down.

**Score rationale:**  
A fully correct RACI is 10. Points are lost for each role-activity mismatch (-0.5 to -1.0 per error) and for missing/incorrect use of “A” (-1 for global error), and for under-representing “I” across the matrix (-1), leading to a total deduction of 3.5 out of 10.

**Final score: 6.5**
