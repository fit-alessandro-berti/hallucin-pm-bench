The LLM answer is factually precise and complete, with no differences in content, sequence, or listings compared to the ground truth. Formatting variations (e.g., code block vs. bullets, added explanations) do not introduce errors, hallucinations, or deviations from the required outputs, as they support accuracy without altering facts. Q1 matches exactly (3). Q2 matches the sequence verbatim, including order and separators. Q3 lists the exact distinct activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line, with correct identification of immediate predecessors across cases.
