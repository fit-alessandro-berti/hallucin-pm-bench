### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the same three activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) as worst-performing based on SLA breaches (throughput exceeding targets) and implicitly high waiting times, aligning with the joint criteria. Quantifies SLA excesses accurately (+300s for Risk Review and Legal Approval; +60s for Credit Assessment), grounding in table data without inventing metrics or activities. Actions are concrete and tied to each activity, avoiding absent elements.
- **Major weaknesses (significant deductions)**: Violates structure by using a numbered list that integrates identification, quantification, and recommendations, instead of reserving bullet points *only* for recommendations (prompt rule 3). Fails to explicitly reference high waiting times in descriptions or quantifications (e.g., no mention of 480s, 600s, or 200s waits, unlike ground truth), weakening the "jointly" basis. "SLA breach: 300 seconds" phrasing is ambiguous (implies throughput as breach rather than excess, vs. ground truth's clear "900 s vs. 600 s SLA (+300 s)"). Actions are generic and not demonstrably "data-driven" (e.g., no table-derived specifics like case volumes or times influencing the recs, contrasting ground truth's tailored suggestions). Adds extraneous closing sentence ("Deadlines met...") not in prompt or data, inflating beyond memo focus. Memo is under ~150 words (~100) and lacks executive context (e.g., total cases, impact projection) present in ground truth. Strictness applied: structural and completeness errors deduct heavily, even if core selection is right.
