8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all key changes in content (added tasks: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject with IDs; removed: Reject Loan with ID; gateway change from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision), aligning with the ground truth's core facts and ignoring non-structural elements like name renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan" or gateway name). No extraneous changes are mentioned, adhering to the prompt's scope.

However, strict deductions for differences:
- **Formatting inconsistencies (significant loss: -1.0)**: Uses unnumbered bullets instead of numbered lists (1., 2., 3.); plain headings without markdown bolding (**Added tasks**); no italics for versions (*v1*, *v2*) in gateway description.
- **Gateway description incompleteness (significant loss: -1.0)**: Omits technical abbreviations "(XOR)" and "(OR)"; lacks explicit reference to "in *v1* to ... in *v2*"; uses capitalized "Exclusive Gateway" instead of lowercase "exclusive" for precision.
- **Missing closing note (minor but strict loss: -0.0 additional, as it's confirmatory but absent)**: Ground truth includes "(No other additions, removals, or gateway-type changes are present.)" for completeness, which the LLM omits.

Overall, high fidelity in substance (90% match) but penalized heavily for stylistic and detail variances per instructions.
