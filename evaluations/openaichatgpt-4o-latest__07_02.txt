10.0

The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in both content and structure. It:

- Correctly lists all added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject).
- Correctly identifies the single removed task (Reject Loan).
- Accurately describes the only gateway-type change (Gateway_Decision: Exclusive â†’ Inclusive).
- No extraneous information or omissions.
- Uses the prescribed three headings.

There are no errors or deviations from the required answer; even the formats and naming are precise. Thus: **10.0**.
