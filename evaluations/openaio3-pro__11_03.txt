### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial match, + points)**: The LLM correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, aligning with the ground truth. Quantification of SLA overruns is identical (+300s for Legal, +300s for Risk, +60s for Credit) and includes accurate throughput/waiting times and case counts (grounded in table data, unlike ground truth's omission of cases). Uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations, as required.
- **Weaknesses (differences, - points; strict deduction for even minor variances)**: 
  - Structure and formatting differ: Simpler header (no "From" line or detailed subject with invented date like "April 2025"); no bolding or closing projection paragraph (ground truth adds a speculative "35% reduction," which is an invention but part of the benchmark).
  - Introduction varies: LLM uses data-grounded "1,200 applications" (from table); ground truth invents "4,805 completed cases" (not derivable from table without summation, violating "no invent metrics" but as benchmark, this counts as a difference).
  - Recommendations are entirely different and non-matching: LLM's actions (e.g., reassign FTE citing Draft Offer's 30s wait, fast-track half of 480 cases, automated scoring for 200s queue) are data-driven but diverge from ground truth's (e.g., pre-checks bypass, add analyst + automate with "peak morning" invention, €25k heuristic—also an invention). Prompt requires "one concrete, data-driven action" per activity; ground truth combines two for Risk, but LLM's are single yet unmatched.
  - Minor: No exact word count match (LLM ≈120 words vs. ground truth ≈160); LLM adds a "Recommended actions" header (not in ground truth but arguably minor). Overall, core analysis matches but recommendations (a key requirement) and ancillary details create substantial divergence, warranting deduction under strict criteria.
