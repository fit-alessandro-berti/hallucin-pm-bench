7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment), quantifies by how much each exceeds its SLA, and mentions the corresponding waiting times, closely aligning with the ground truth. However, there are notable issues that reflect strict scoring:

- **Case counts**: The ground truth notes a total sample size of 4,805 cases, while the LLM answer aggregates individual case counts for each activity (e.g., 465, 480, etc.) without reference to the overall sample, but this is not technically an error as per the prompt since only table data may be used. However, a slight point dock reflects lack of context.
- **Action recommendations**: The suggestions are plausible and data-driven but differ in specificity compared to the ground truth. For example:
   - Reassigning one legal FTE from Draft Offer is not grounded in table data (there’s nothing specifying resource allocation or suggesting Draft Offer is over-resourced; that wait is only 30 s, yes, but transferring FTE is an inference).
   - Fast-track lane for Risk Review is not directly supported by the table (diverting "half the 480 cases" is not in the data), making this at least a partial invention.
   - Implementing automated scoring for Credit Assessment is plausible but less specific than the ground truth’s “straight-through” heuristic for loans under €25k (but currency threshold is not in table, so the LLM had to stay general).
- **Sentence grounding**: The LLM almost always grounds statements in the table but makes small speculative leaps for recommendations rather than strictly adhering to what’s supported by the supplied data.
- **Formatting**: The memo is properly concise, uses bullet points only for recommendations, and doesn’t introduce activities or metrics not present in the data.

**Summary**: The LLM answer is clear, concise, and mostly data-grounded, but introduces minor, non-table-based recommendations and assumptions around staffing and process changes. These are not strictly warranted by the supplied data alone, so under rigorous grading, this must result in loss of points.
