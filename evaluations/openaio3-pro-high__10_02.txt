6.0

- The LLM answer uses the mandated role terms correctly everywhere (no “clerk”, “officer”, etc.) and task wording is mostly acceptable or closely matched.
- However, compared to the ground truth, there are several notable errors:
  1. **Missing Operations Manager:** The ground truth includes “Operations Manager” as a role, but the LLM answer omits it entirely. In consequence, several tasks are missing the appropriate “Accountable” assignment.
  2. **Inconsistent RACI Assignments:** The LLM assigns “R / A” (Responsible and Accountable together) to the same person for nearly all steps, which is poor practice and contradicts the ground truth’s clear segregation of R and A across different roles. For instance, “Accountable” is meant to be with “Operations Manager” (per ground truth), never with “Transaction Analyst” or “IT Support”.
  3. **Extra/Unnecessary Tasks:** The LLM separates “Dispatch SWIFT message” and “Archive case file & notify Regulatory Liaison”, tasks that are not mapped exactly as in the ground truth. The ground truth collapses these correctly per the informal description and enforced vocabulary.
  4. **Non-mandated Actions/Terminology:** Steps like “Notify Regulatory Liaison” are added, which is not present in the ground truth.
  5. **Inconsistent Column Order/Task Mapping:** The LLM’s table structure and wording are less precise and organized than the ground truth. Ground truth is rigorous about ensuring exactly the mandated synonyms for all activities.
  6. **Inelegant Legend/Presentation:** No separation of legend or explicit mention of RACI definitions as in the ground truth.

Given these issues—most importantly, the missing “Operations Manager” (which affects the “Accountable” assignment for every task) and conflation of R/A for the same role, as well as imprecise mapping and wording—a strict evaluation places this answer at a 6.0. It gets major elements correct regarding the vocabulary mandate but fails on key accuracy and strictness criteria.
