### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Partial Credit, but Strict Deduction)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions, mapping them appropriately to source roles (e.g., no "Compliance Officer" or "Customer Due Diligence"). This aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on enforced synonyms. However, the ground truth explicitly notes this as a requirement, and while met, it does not offset other structural flaws.
  
- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Major Deduction)**: The informal description has 6 steps, and the ground truth maps them precisely to 6 tasks with mandated wording (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "Screen Against Sanctions List", "**KYC Review**"). The LLM answer introduces discrepancies:
  - 7 tasks instead of 6, including an unmandated split ("Dispatch SWIFT message" as #6, not present in ground truth or explicitly separate in source—source combines it under "ensures the SWIFT message is sent" in step 5).
  - Combined/inaccurate #7 ("Archive case file & notify Regulatory Liaison") deviates from ground truth's clean "Archive Record" (step 6), adding "notify" as a sub-element not distinctly tasked in ground truth.
  - Wording differences: e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction" (extra details not in GT); "Conduct sanctions-list screening" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List" (verbose and non-matching); "Approve high-risk transaction (if flagged)" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions" (added conditional phrasing absent in GT). These are small but per strictness criteria, warrant significant point loss for not mirroring GT exactly.
  - Omits explicit coverage of notification in step 6 as "Informed" status; instead, embeds it poorly in #7.

- **Roles and RACI Assignments (Severe Deduction)**: Ground truth uses 4 roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support), with comprehensive assignments in every cell (no blanks). LLM uses only 3 roles (omitting Operations Manager entirely, a critical structural mismatch despite not being mandated in prompt—GT includes it, so absence is a direct difference). Assignments differ substantially even for overlapping elements:
  - e.g., Task 2 (screening): LLM has Analyst "R/A", Liaison "C", IT blank (–); GT has Analyst "R", Liaison "A", Operations Manager "I", IT "C" (Liaison C vs. A is a role mismatch; combined "R/A" vs. separate bold "**R**" or "**A**"; blanks vs. full coverage).
  - Task 3 (KYC): LLM Analyst "C", Liaison "R/A", IT blank; GT Analyst "C", Liaison "**R**", Operations Manager "**A**", IT "I" (partial match but missing role and "R/A" approximation vs. precise "**R**"; blank vs. "I").
  - Task 5 (Release): Similar partial overlap (Analyst "R/A" vs. "**R**"; Liaison "I" matches; IT "C" matches), but extra tasks (#6, #7) have non-matching assignments (e.g., #7 Analyst "I" vs. GT Archive Analyst "C").
  - Use of "R/A" combined notation is non-standard vs. GT's separate bolded "**R**" or "**A**" per cell. Blanks (–) indicate incomplete matrix vs. GT's full population.

- **Structure and Formatting (Moderate Deduction)**: Both use Markdown tables, but LLM adds an unnecessary "#" column (absent in GT), places legend at top vs. GT's bottom, and lacks GT's header "(mandated wording)" and bolding for "**KYC Review**". No extra notes on mapping/omissions as in GT. Title "RACI Matrix for AtlasRemit" is extra but not harmful; however, overall less clear organization per prompt.

- **Overall Strictness Application**: Under utmost strictness, the LLM covers ~70% of GT's essence (vocab, basic tasks, Markdown) but has cascading errors in structure (extra/missing tasks, role omission), wording (non-identical phrasing), and assignments (mismatches, blanks, combined notation). This results in a non-equivalent table that does not "map every step... without omissions or substitutions" as GT exemplifies. Small wording/notation errors alone deduct ~2-3 points; combined with major diffs (roles, task count), score caps low. Not 1.0 as it attempts a valid RACI and uses mandated terms; not higher due to pervasive deviations.
