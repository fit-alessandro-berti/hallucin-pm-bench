The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks in the specified order, fully aligning with the factual content of the ground truth. However, it loses points for minor formatting differences (e.g., lack of descriptive labels like "Set 1 – first parallel block:", absence of `code` backticks and ‖ symbol, simple comma separation instead of structured parallelism notation) and omission of the concluding sentence affirming no other parallels, which adds explicit completeness in the ground truth. These small deviations warrant a deduction despite overall strong accuracy.
