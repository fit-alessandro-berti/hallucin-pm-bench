The answer uses the authorized vocabulary, with no synonyms or unapproved terms leaking in—this is correct and merits points. However:

**Major deductions:**
- Activity names do not match the ground truth exactly for two steps:
    - "Compliance Officer Approval" is correct, but "Treasury Execution" (in the LLM answer) should be "Release Funds".
- The RACI assignments deviate notably from the ground truth in several places:
    - For "Intake Vetting", Front-Office Analyst is only marked "Responsible" (not both Responsible and Accountable), and Compliance Officer is marked "Accountable" (should be uninvolved/–).
    - For "KYC Review", Front-Office Analyst is "Informed" (should be uninvolved/–), Compliance Officer is "Accountable" (should be Consulted), Treasury Ops is "Consulted" (should be Informed).
    - "AML Screening" suffers similar assignment errors.
    - "Risk Scoring": Compliance Officer is "Accountable" (which is good), but Front-Office Analyst is only "Informed", should be "Consulted"; Compliance Analyst is missing the Accountable flag.
    - "Release Funds" is missing entirely and instead "Treasury Execution" is present, lacking the right role assignments.
- RACI conventions (R, A, C, I) are not always assigned per ground truth; Accountable is sometimes shared with Responsible for secondary roles, which mismatches the standard practice, and the matrix is inconsistent in this respect.
- Dashes/absence notation (–) is not consistently applied for uninvolved roles, as specified.

**Other:**
- The matrix is formatted in Markdown, as requested.
- No activities are merged, renamed (except the two noted), or added.

**Conclusion:**
While the main activity names and roles are mostly represented, the assignment of RACI codes and adherence to ground truth expectations are only partially correct, and naming errors plus role/assignment mismatches are significant and pervasive. This warrants a strict penalty.
