3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt but incurs severe penalties due to multiple critical deviations from the ground truth under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Vocabulary and Activity Naming (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) are correctly used and bolded, with no disallowed synonyms leaking in—aligning with the key points. However, the added activities are mishandled: "Compliance Officer Approval" lacks bolding (**), and "Treasury Execution" is an unauthorized rename/interpretation of the narrative's "releases the funds" (ground truth uses "**Release Funds**"). The prompt forbids renaming or adding activities, treating these as invalid inventions/merges, which significantly deviates from the ground truth's exact naming and formatting.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: Nearly every cell mismatches the ground truth, indicating fundamental misinterpretation of the process narrative. Examples:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office is correctly Responsible (R) but incorrectly lacks Accountable (A); Compliance Officer is wrongly Accountable (A) instead of uninvolved (–); Compliance Analyst is entirely omitted (should be Consulted/C); Treasury Ops is correctly Informed (I).
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office wrongly Informed (I, should be –); Compliance Analyst correctly Responsible (R) but lacks A; Compliance Officer wrongly Accountable (A, should be C); Treasury Ops wrongly Consulted (C, should be I).
  - **AML Screening**: Identical errors to KYC Review—systematic mismatch.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office wrongly Informed (I, should be C); Compliance Analyst correctly R but lacks adjustments; Compliance Officer correctly A but overall partial; Treasury Ops wrongly C (should be I).
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Front-Office and Compliance Analyst omitted (blanks instead of I and C); Compliance Officer partially correct (R/A) but formatted as "Responsible / Accountable" (not "**R, A**"); Treasury Ops wrongly C (should be –).
  - **Treasury Execution** (invalid name): Front-Office correctly I; Treasury Ops partially R but lacks A and omits Consulted (C) for Analyst and Officer; entire row ignores their involvement.
  These are not minor; they represent wholesale errors in responsibility mapping, with empty/blank cells failing to use "–" for no involvement as in ground truth.

- **Formatting and Structure (Moderate Deduction: -1.0 point)**: The Markdown table structure is mostly intact (headers match, six rows cover "every activity"), but:
  - Uses full words (e.g., "Responsible") instead of abbreviations (R, A, C, I) as in ground truth— a clear stylistic/format difference.
  - Lacks bolding (** ) around R/A in cells (e.g., no "**R, A**") and for added activity names.
  - Employs blanks/spaces for no involvement instead of "–", reducing clarity and deviating from ground truth.
  - No key/legend is present, though not explicitly required, but ground truth's conventions (e.g., "**R, A**" for dual roles) are ignored.

- **Overall Completeness and Fidelity (Minor Credit: +2.0 baseline)**: Covers all roles and infers the two additional activities from the narrative (escalation approval and fund release), avoiding mergers. No extraneous content or synonyms. However, the cumulative differences ( ~70% cell-level mismatches, invalid naming) make it far from ground truth equivalence.

This yields a low score reflecting "utmost strictness," where even partial correctness in vocabulary cannot offset pervasive inaccuracies in content, naming, and format. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, it's a flawed attempt with core elements intact but executionally defective.
