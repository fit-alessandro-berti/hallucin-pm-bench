### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a solid overall justification by citing all three cases with accurate timestamps and sequences for Cases 1001 and 1003, mirroring the ground truth's reversal observation. It also concludes correctly that no case shows the claimed sequence, aligning with the ground truth's emphasis on "none of the three cases."

However, under strict evaluation, deduct significant points (3.0 total) for:
- **Misleading phrasing in Case 1002 (major error, -2.0):** The LLM states it "follows the claimed sequence" despite no `Update_Inventory` occurring at all, which contradicts the fact's requirement for `Authorize_Refund` *immediately before* `Update_Inventory`. This inverts the ground truth's precise disproof via absence ("`Update_Inventory` never appears, so 'always' is already disproved"), potentially confusing readers.
- **Minor structural/precision gaps (-1.0):** Lacks explicit line references (uses timestamps, which are equivalent but not identical to ground truth's citation style); does not directly tie Case 1002's absence to disproving "always"; slightly wordier without the ground truth's concise "Short verdict" format.

The answer is substantively strong (80% alignment) but flawed enough in precision to fall short of perfection.
