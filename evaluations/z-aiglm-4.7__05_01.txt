**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Major error (attachment point)**: LLM attaches timer to `Task_Check` (after `Task_Receive`), causing total time from submission (`Start_Claim`) to exceed 48h (e.g., Receive duration + 48h). Ground truth correctly uses `Task_Receive` to start timer immediately post-submission. This fails SLA compliance (-4.0 points).
- **Missing details**: No event ID (`Timer_48h`), no `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>` syntax, no explicit "new sequenceFlow" (-1.5 points).
- **Minor similarities**: Correctly identifies interrupting boundary timer, target `Task_Triage`, bypassing logic, plain English, concise (partial +1.5 points).
- Strict deduction for all differences; core functional flaw dominates.
