The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content across all questions:
- Q1: Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003); extra enumeration is accurate and non-fabricated.
- Q2: Exact sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" (minor formatting like leading dash is presentational, not erroneous).
- Q3: Exact distinct predecessors ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), listed one per line and alphabetically ordered (A before C).

No hallucinations, omissions, additions, or errors; format variations (e.g., verbosity, bullets) do not alter factual precision.
