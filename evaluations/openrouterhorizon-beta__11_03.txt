7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, grounding selections in the table's data without invention. Quantification of SLA exceedances is precise and identical to the ground truth (+300s for Risk Review and Legal Approval; +60s for Credit Assessment), with accurate references to throughput times, waiting times, and case volumes per activity. The memo format is concise (~180 words), uses paragraphs for analysis and bullets exclusively for recommendations as required, and returns only memo text without extraneous content.

However, strict deductions apply for differences: 
- **Structure and formatting (major loss: -1.0)**: Lacks formal header (To/From/Subject), starts informally with "COO,", and uses plain text without bolding or italics for emphasis, unlike the ground truth's polished executive style.
- **Phrasing and order (moderate loss: -0.5)**: Analysis is more verbose with full sentences and case counts (not emphasized in ground truth), and orders activities differently (Risk Review first vs. Legal Approval first). No mention of total cases (e.g., ground truth's "4 805 completed cases") or contextual framing like "Throughput Bottlenecks in Loan-Origination."
- **Recommendations (significant loss: -1.0)**: While concrete and data-driven (tying to specific waiting times/cases), the actions differ entirely from the ground truth's more targeted suggestions (e.g., LLM's "prioritization queue" vs. ground truth's "rule-based pre-checks"; no automation or loan-amount specifics). Lacks a closing projection or implementation note.
Small errors like inconsistent comma in "1,175" (vs. ground truth's no commas) and slight wordiness compound the divergence, preventing a higher score despite strong core alignment.
