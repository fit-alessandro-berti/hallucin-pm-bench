7.0

The LLM answer is accurate and concise but has several notable shortcomings compared to the ground truth answer. Here are the reasons for deducting points:

- The memo does not include a subject line, sender, or a formal greeting as in the ground truth memo.
- The overview sentence is less formal and lacks mention of the total case volume (“4 805 completed cases”) given in the ground truth.
- The quantification of SLA breaches and waiting times is mostly accurate and correctly identifies the same three activities.
- The case counts per activity are cited, but not as clearly highlighted in the context of queue size/impact as in the ground truth (which quantifies case loads for overall context).
- The recommendations are relevant and technically correlate with the LLM-supplied data, but they are more generic than the highly specific, data-grounded recommendations of the ground truth answer (“rule-based pre-checks...”, “add one risk analyst...”, “deploy a ‘straight-through’ heuristic under €25k...”).
- The LLM sometimes strays from what is strictly present in the table to offer more general process improvement ideas rather than data-driven, specific actions.
- The claim to “introduce a prioritization queue” (Risk Review) and “streamline pre-assessment checks” (Credit Assessment) is only lightly grounded in the data and less precise.
- The ground truth provides an estimate of the potential benefit (“reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35% and restore SLA compliance”), which is absent from the LLM memo.

Overall, while the LLM answer is correct regarding identification and quantification, notable points are lost for formality, the non-specific nature of recommendations, and a lack of precise, data-based implementation detail.
