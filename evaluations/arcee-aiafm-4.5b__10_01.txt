The LLM answer fails catastrophically on multiple fronts, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key violations include: (1) Complete disregard for the vocabulary policyâ€”it uses all three forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence," "Order Validation," "Payment Processing") verbatim in the table, without substituting the mandated preferred terms ("KYC Review," "Order Vetting," "Payment Clearance"), which is a core, non-negotiable requirement. None of the required synonyms appear, directly contradicting the "strictly adhering" instruction. (2) Incorrect table structure: Columns are labeled R/I/C/A instead of using roles (Account Manager, etc.) as columns, as in the ground truth and implied by standard RACI format for this prompt. (3) Incomplete and inaccurate RACI assignments that do not reflect the process narrative (e.g., omits multiple roles like C for CO in Receive Application, A for AM in KYC Review, and I for several activities; ground truth shows nuanced multi-role involvement). (4) Misleading notes falsely claim adherence to terminology and miscount rows/columns (6 activities require 7 table rows including header, not "four rows"). These errors compound to zero alignment with the ground truth, representing a total failure to follow the prompt.
