10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1 and 2 (a/b), with precise counts and rounding. For question 3, the response adheres to the ≤100-word limit (62 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue (i), highlights instability/variance through skewing metrics and overestimation in small samples (ii), and cautions against over-generalization by noting misrepresentation of population behavior (iii). No inventions or deviations from the log; explanation is concise, relevant, and aligned with the sample's intent without unnecessary additions.
