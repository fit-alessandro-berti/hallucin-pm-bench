**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in nearly every aspect, warranting the minimum score under utmost strictness:

- **Roles mismatch**: Uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support (3 columns); ground truth has Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support (4 columns). Introduces no Operations Manager.
- **Task descriptions differ**: 7 tasks vs. 6; wordings not identical (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" ≠ "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform **KYC Review** (Sender and Beneficiary)" ≠ "**KYC Review**"; adds unmerged "Ensure SWIFT message transmission"; "Archive case file" ≠ "Archive Record"). No "(mandated wording)" header note.
- **RACI assignments entirely different**: No row or cell matches (e.g., Receive: TA **R** only vs. TA **R**, RL I, OM **A**, IT C; all others mismatch completely).
- **Legend incomplete**: Omits "C (Consulted)"; ground truth includes full RACI. No assignments use C.
- **Structure/extras**: Adds unnecessary title "# RACI Matrix..."; legend wording/style differs; bolding and formatting minor variances (e.g., no full legend spacing match).
- **Vocabulary**: Uses mandated terms correctly (no deductions there), but fails to replicate ground truth's exact phrasing/structure/assignments.

Even minor wording differences (e.g., capitalization, plurals) compound with core mismatches for total failure to align.
