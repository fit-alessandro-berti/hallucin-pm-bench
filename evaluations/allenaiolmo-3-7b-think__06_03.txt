The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two concurrent task sets from Process B in the correct order, with no mention of Processes A or C, fully matching the core content of the ground truth. Minor deductions for: (1) slightly different formatting (bullets and **Set X** vs inline `task` ‖ `task` with descriptive labels like "first parallel block"); (2) extraneous but accurate explanatory note (not present in ground truth, adding ~20% extra content); (3) absence of ground truth's explicit "No other tasks..." closing statement. These are small stylistic/presentation deviations under utmost strictness, warranting a modest but noticeable point loss from perfection.
