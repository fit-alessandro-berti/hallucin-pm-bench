The LLM answer is factually correct, precisely refutes the claim across all cases with accurate sequences, addresses "always" and "immediately before" correctly, and cites case IDs/activities as prompted. Justification is clear, structured (table + bullets), and evidence-based without invention.

Minor deductions (-0.3 total) for strictness:
- No line number citations (GT has them for precision, e.g., "lines 3-4", tying directly to data fragment).
- Phrasing "not accurate" vs. GT's "inaccurate" (synonymous but not identical).
- Extra table format adds clarity but deviates from GT's simple bullet style, introducing non-minimal structure.

No factual errors, guesses, or omissions; extremely close match.
