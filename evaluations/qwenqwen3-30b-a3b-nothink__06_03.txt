The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of parallel tasks in Process B, numbers them in order, and lists all tasks (with exact task names) that can execute concurrently under each parallel construct. The format is clear and unambiguous.

The only minor differences are:
- The LLM answer omits labels such as "first parallel block" and "second parallel block" that the ground truth uses, and does not state explicitly that no other tasks can run in parallel.  
- Also, the ground truth uses the double bar "‖" notation to signify parallelism between the tasks. The LLM answer implicitly conveys this by listing under bullets, but does not use the "‖" notation. 

These are minor presentation issues and do not affect the technical correctness or completeness, but under strict grading as requested, they warrant a slight deduction.
