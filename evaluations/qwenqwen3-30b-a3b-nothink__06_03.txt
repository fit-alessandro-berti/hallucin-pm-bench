The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the core content of the ground truth with exact task names and order. However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for: (1) omitting descriptive labels like "– first parallel block:" and "– second parallel block:", (2) lacking backticks around task names, (3) using bullet-point lists instead of inline notation with the ‖ symbol to explicitly denote parallelism, and (4) missing the closing statement confirming no other parallel tasks. These formatting and completeness differences represent small but multiple errors, warranting a deduction despite the substantive accuracy.
