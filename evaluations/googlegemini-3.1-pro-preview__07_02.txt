**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (basis for ~7+ score)**: Correctly identifies **all** required changes without omissions or fabrications. Added tasks (3 exact matches), Removed tasks (1 exact match), Gateway-type change (1 exact match: exclusive → inclusive).
- **Penalties (significant deductions for differences, per strict criteria)**:
  - **Extra descriptive content (-1.0)**: Verbose explanations (e.g., "inserted at the beginning... shifting flows"; "routed outcome"; "handle ineligible... path"; "structurally removed... replaced"; flow expansions under gateway) violate "summarise" brevity and introduce ignored elements (flows, positions). Ground truth is purely list-based.
  - **Misplaced content under headings (-0.8)**: Flow branch details ("outgoing sequence flows expanded... to three branches") wrongly categorized under "Gateway-type changes" (strictly element type only, e.g., `<exclusiveGateway>` → `<inclusiveGateway>`). Not a type change.
  - **Formatting/structure differences (-0.6)**: Uses bold/**•**/* sub-bullets/descriptions vs. ground truth's plain numbered lists (1., 2., 3.). Extra parenthetical notes (e.g., XML ID reasoning, cosmetics) outside strict headings.
  - **Minor phrasing variances (-0.4)**: "Upgraded" vs. "changed"; no "(XOR)/(OR)" acronyms; no closing "No other... present" note.
- **No factual errors**, but extras create clear differences from ground truth's minimalism. Total deductions yield 7.2 (high but not perfect under utmost strictness).
