7.0

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Correctness of Overall Decision (Non-compliant)**: Matches ground truth perfectly (+2.0 points).
- **Identification of Violations**: Correctly cites Rules 2 and 3 as violated, with accurate event references for Rule 2 (e.g., #8 vs. #9 order) (+2.0 points). For Rule 3, correctly identifies violation but with a minor counting discrepancy (claims "4 activities after" vs. ground truth's "distance=3"), which under strictness deducts -1.0 point.
- **Completeness**: Fails to address Rules 1, 4, and 5, which ground truth evaluates exhaustively (satisfied or not). This is a significant gap, as the justification should ideally cite *all relevant rules* for a full audit, per the thorough ground truth structure (-2.0 points).
- **Detail and Structure**: Lacks the ground truth's depth (e.g., no explicit "Satisfied/Violated" labels, no event-by-event breakdowns for all rules, no summary conclusion tying violations to overall non-compliance). Numbered list is present but abbreviated (-1.0 point).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: No major factual errors beyond the minor distance count, but incompleteness and reduced detail reflect meaningful differences from the comprehensive ground truth, warranting deductions.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deductions lead to 7.0. The response is functional and hits the core issues but is not as rigorous or exhaustive as required.
