6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core factual accuracy (high marks here)**: The LLM correctly identifies the added tasks (check_vip, generate_qr), removed task (send_rma_label), and gateway change (gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). No incorrect additions, removals, or speculations—matches the ground truth facts.
- **Format and structure (partial deduction)**: Headings match the prompt's exact specification (• Added tasks, etc.). However, the listing style (plain ids on new lines without bullets) differs from ground truth's structured * bullets, leading to a less readable and precise presentation. No "(none)" for empty categories (not needed here), but this is minor.
- **Detail level and exactness (significant deduction)**: 
  - For tasks, the LLM uses only XML ids (e.g., "check_vip"), but the prompt requires "element names exactly as they appear in the XML." Ground truth interprets this as including the full <name> attribute (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"), which provides complete factual XML-derived info. Omitting names is a key shortfall, as they are explicit in the snippets and essential for describing differences without ambiguity.
  - For gateway, the LLM's concise "(from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway)" captures the essence but omits explicit versioning "(v1)" and "(v2)" from ground truth, reducing precision. No bolding or formatting for emphasis, which ground truth uses to highlight types.
  - Missing the ground truth's closing note "(No other differences should be reported.)", though not strictly required by the prompt, implies incomplete adherence to a thorough, non-speculative summary.
- **Strictness applied**: Even though facts are right, the lack of full XML name details and minor phrasing/versioning omissions are "small errors" per instructions, warranting significant point loss (from 10.0). This isn't a perfect match—it's functional but incomplete, hence 6.0 (mid-range, acknowledging correctness but penalizing detail gaps).
