The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the exact same core improvement (changing the `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" for the `Task_CollectEquipment` task) without adding or deleting elements, adheres to the rules, and uses a valid unified diff format (though more verbose than the minimal ground truth version). However, the rationale slightly deviates by not referencing the specific 3-day contractual SLA or explicitly noting the absence of new activities, resulting in a minor loss of precision and alignment with the ground truth's wording.
