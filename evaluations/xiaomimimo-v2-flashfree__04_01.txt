**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring breakdown):
- **Overall verdict (Non-compliant)**: Matches ground truth (+1.0).
- **Rule 1**: Not mentioned or justified at all (-1.0; ground truth explicitly satisfies it).
- **Rule 2**: Correctly identifies violation with accurate citation (event 8 vs. 9) (+2.0).
- **Rule 3**: Completely missed; this is a clear violation (Goods_Received at 6, Three_way_match at 10, distance=4 >2), yet LLM ignores it entirely (-3.0).
- **Rule 4**: Reaches correct conclusion (satisfied, Intern at 7 does not directly follow CFO at 3), but with excessive rambling, initial confusion, and multiple self-"corrections" deviating from clean analysis (-1.0).
- **Rule 5**: Not mentioned or justified at all (-1.0; ground truth explicitly satisfies it).
- **Comprehensiveness & format**: Fails to systematically check *all* rules as in ground truth; incomplete numbered justification; ends with unnecessary "definitive violation" phrasing implying only one issue (-1.0); convoluted structure (-0.8).
- **Strictness adjustment**: Small errors (e.g., rambling) compounded by major omissions (full ruleset analysis, second violation) result in significant deductions per instructions.

Total: Matches on core outcome and one rule but critically incomplete and messy → 4.2/10.0.
