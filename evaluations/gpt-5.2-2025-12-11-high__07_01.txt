6.0

The LLM answer is factually accurate in identifying the correct added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway change (`gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). No extra or missing items, no speculation—perfect compliance with content requirements.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Headings mismatch**: Uses `### Added tasks` etc. instead of ground truth's `**Added tasks**` (or prompt's `• Added tasks`). Loss of 1.0.
- **List item format major deviation**: Full verbose XML tags (e.g., `<task id="check_vip" name="Check Customer VIP Status"/>`) vs. ground truth's concise `Name (id = `id`)`. Misinterprets "element names exactly" as full tags rather than name/id summary; preserves irrelevant details like spaces, id/name in gateway. Significant loss of 2.0.
- **Bullet style**: `-` vs. `*`. Minor but per strictness, loss of 0.5.
- **Gateway verbosity**: Unnecessarily includes full tags with unchanged `id`/`name` vs. clean type-only change. Loss of 0.5.

Total deductions: 4.0 from 10.0. Semantically strong but textually divergent.
