3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Correctness (Core Decision and Key Violations - 4.0 potential, reduced to 2.0)**: The LLM correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" due to violations in Rules 2 and 3, matching the ground truth's conclusion. It accurately notes the Rule 2 issue (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods due to Expedite_Flag) and Rule 3 issue (Three_way_match too far after Goods_Received). However, it partially ignores Rule 3 in the final summary justification, focusing only on Rule 2, which deviates from the ground truth's comprehensive coverage of all rules. Significant deduction for incomplete final justification against the prompt's requirement to "cite the relevant rules" (plural).
  
- **Accuracy of Rule-Specific Explanations (-2.0 deduction)**: 
  - Rule 1: Agrees compliant but includes contradictory rambling (initially claims "violated" then backtracks; invents irrelevant "timeline" issues not in the trace or rules). Ground truth is clear and error-free.
  - Rule 2: Mostly accurate, but includes factual error (wrong timestamp for Ship_Goods: claims 12:05 instead of 09:40 from trace).
  - Rule 3: Identifies violation but errs on distance calculation ("distance=4" vs. ground truth's "distance=3"; ambiguous rule interpretation, but LLM's count mismatches trace positions from 6 to 10, which is a 4-position span or 3 intervening activities).
  - Rule 4: Major factual error—claims Intern activity (step 7) is preceded by step 8 (Ship_Goods), reversing the sequence entirely (actual predecessor is step 6). Ground truth correctly notes no direct CFO follow-up.
  - Rule 5: Agrees compliant, no major issues.
  These errors (especially sequence reversal and timestamp) are not "small" and indicate poor trace reading, warranting heavy loss.

- **Structure and Format (-2.0 deduction)**: Prompt requires "Compliant” or “Non-compliant”, followed by a numbered justification citing relevant rules. LLM starts correctly but devolves into disorganized, stream-of-consciousness rambling (e.g., self-correction in Rule 1, unnecessary "summary of violations" debate on "first violation," redundant rephrasing at end). Ground truth is concise, systematically numbered per rule, and ends with a clear overall statement. LLM's messiness violates the professional, audit-bot persona and makes it harder to follow.

- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., timestamp, distance) cause significant loss; combined with structural disarray and factual mistakes, this pulls the score down sharply despite the right high-level outcome. No credit for extraneous analysis (e.g., "choose the first violation").
