The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth in terms of identified changes (correct added/removed tasks and gateway modifications). However, it introduces minor formatting deviations: leading dashes before headings (not present in ground truth), backticks around element descriptions (not used in ground truth or strictly required beyond the prompt's illustrative example), and sub-bullet indentation. These small inconsistencies warrant a deduction despite the perfect content match, per the strict evaluation criteria.
