6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is mostly accurate in identifying and describing the core decision points and listing all required documents using the exact terminology from the prompt. However, under strict evaluation criteria, several differences from the ground truth warrant a significant deduction:

#### Decision Points (Major Issues, ~40% deduction here)
- **Structure and Completeness**: The ground truth clearly enumerates exactly 3 decision points with precise positioning (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for Underwriter Alignment Gate; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for Amount Threshold Decision), using numbered list format, bolding, and arrow notation (⇒) for branches. The LLM uses bullets without numbering, bolding, or positioning context, making it less precise and harder to map to the process flow. This omits structural fidelity.
- **Harmonisation Committee**: The ground truth integrates this as a conditional escalation *within* the Underwriter Alignment Gate (not a standalone point). The LLM erroneously treats it as a separate fourth decision point ("Harmonisation Committee (within the Underwriter Alignment Gate path when triggered)"), introducing redundancy and altering the summary's hierarchy. This is a clear deviation, as the prompt emphasizes "exact terminology and flow."
- **Wording Precision**: Minor but penalizable differences include "proceed to" vs. ground truth's "send to" for Amount Threshold; lowercase "approve or reject" vs. capitalized "Approve or Reject" for MBA; and added "then continue" phrasing that slightly expands beyond the ground truth's concise summary.
- **Overall**: Captures the essence but introduces an extra point and loses flow context, reducing clarity and adherence.

#### Required Documents (Minor Issues, ~10% deduction here)
- **List Accuracy**: All 6 documents are correctly identified and use exact names. No introductions of standard terminology (good adherence).
- **Wording Variations**: 
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" adds "old" (not in ground truth's "≤ 3 months"), a small but unnecessary embellishment.
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" expands "pay-stub/tax slip" with "single" and "or" instead of "/", deviating slightly from ground truth's brevity.
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes "template" (faithful to the original prompt), but ground truth omits it, creating a minor mismatch.
- **Missing Element**: The ground truth includes an explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), which reinforces the prompt's warning against standard loan terminology and emphasizes the non-standard process. The LLM omits this entirely, missing a key interpretive aspect.
- **Formatting**: Bullets vs. ground truth's numbered list, but this is less critical than content.

#### General Adherence
- Follows prompt instructions well by avoiding standard loan terms and sticking to activity names.
- Response is concise and directly answers the query without extraneous content.
- Total score reflects high overall similarity (~80% match) but penalizes the decision points' structural/interpretive errors and the documents' omissions/variations severely per the strictness directive. A perfect 10.0 requires near-identical phrasing, structure, and completeness.
