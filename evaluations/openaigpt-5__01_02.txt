8.0

The LLM answer is largely accurate and generally matches the ground truth, but there are small errors and minor deviations that warrant point deduction under strict criteria:

**Strengths:**
- Lists all three proper decision points: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- Uses the correct process terminology and refrains from introducing standard loan language.
- Required documents list is accurate and complete, with appropriate names and order.

**Errors / Deductions:**
- The answer lists “Harmonisation Committee” as a standalone decision point. In the official process, this is not a discrete activity, but a sub-path within the Underwriter Alignment Gate. While the text does clarify it's “within the Underwriter Alignment Gate path when triggered”, strictly the summary should not elevate it to its own list bullet. This is a deviation in presenting the structure and could be confusing.
- In the required documents list, the LLM answer includes “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” rather than simply “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” as in the ground truth. This could cause confusion about whether a template or the filled-out statement is required. Also, “(single pay-stub or tax slip)” for the income statement is more detailed, but not incorrect.
- The answer omits the extra clarifying note about what is not needed: “(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)”. While not required in the main list, this additional clarity is missing.

Given these minor structural and wording deviations, a 2-point deduction is justified.

**Final Score:** 8.0
