The LLM answer is highly accurate and fully aligned with the ground truth answer. It clearly states that the calculations for average cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval are not possible due to missing data in Artefact A, specifically the absence of event rows and timestamps. It provides an appropriate justification: without actual event data (rows and concrete times for "Approve Invoice"), these metrics cannot be computed.

Minor deductions (0.5 points) apply for slight verbosity and some indirect referencing (e.g., "process-mining audit" intro and repeating "not possible" instead of a direct "impossible"), as well as providing a tiny bit of context from Artefact B that, while not incorrect, is not strictly necessary. However, there are no factual errors or unwarranted inferences.

The answer is correct, precise, and suitable for a process mining expert context.
