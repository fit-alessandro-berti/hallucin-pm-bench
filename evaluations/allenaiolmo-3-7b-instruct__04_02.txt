**4.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict criteria):
- **Format non-compliance (-3.0 major deduction)**: Does not list each rule with explicit **Compliant**, **Violated**, or **Not Applicable** status (e.g., R1/R2 descriptive only, no bold statuses). Starts with overall result instead of per-rule analysis. No ≤20-word structure per rule. Ground truth uses clear table with bold statuses.
- **R1 factual error (-1.5)**: Wrongly implies violation (mixes with R2 timing); ground truth **Compliant** (Manager then Finance present pre-change).
- **R2 justification error (-1.0)**: Claims >2 days from 2025-03-04 Finance to 03-05 Ship (actually ~26h, within 2 days); ignores post-change final approval (07-Mar) as ground truth does.
- **R3/R4/R6 correct status/implied match (+1.0 partial)**: R3/R6 explicit; R4 exact.
- **R5 mostly matches (+0.5 partial)**: Captures violation but lacks ground truth specificity (Ship/Pay before new Manager_Approval).
- **Overall correct (+0.0)**: Matches NON-COMPLIANT.

Total reflects multiple violations of format, accuracy, and precision; small errors (e.g., R2 timing) incur outsized penalties per instructions.
