3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Major failure. #1 correct (Request_Documents, verbatim times). #2 **wrong** (Initial_Screening at 2.1h avg is ~5th worst; omits actual #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2h). #3 correct (Assess_Liability) but displaced. Numbers quoted correctly where used, but invalid selection invalidates ranking "strictly by waiting-time".
- **No unwarranted content**: Compliant—no service times, throughput, or extra activities.
- **Action relevance**: Weak. Actions vaguely logical but **not data-driven** (no pilots, tests, or data-backed estimates like ground truth's "pilot tests show ≥25%", "estimated 30%"). Phrasing like "up to 20%" undermines ≥20% guarantee; others generic ("more efficient process").
- **Format/conciseness**: Email-style exceeds "crisp memo" (unnecessary subject/greeting/closing); ~140 words (ok limit) but less structured than ground truth's precise list.
- **Overall**: ~33% alignment (1/3 activities perfect; partial #3; rest deficient). Strict penalty for core ranking error (-4+ pts), vague actions (-2 pts), format drift (-1 pt).
