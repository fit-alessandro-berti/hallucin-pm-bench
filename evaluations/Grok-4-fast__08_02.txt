The LLM answer is almost entirely correct and concise. It gives the right answer to Q1 ("Yes") and provides a correct minimal firing sequence ([T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]) for Q2. The explanation correctly notes the path via P1→P3→P4→P5, and that T5 fires without T3 having fired.

**Strict deductions:**
- The explanation, while correct, could be slightly clearer regarding why T3 remains unfired: specifically, it doesn’t explicitly point out that firing T5 disables T3 for the remainder of the execution.
- The answer could more clearly state the markings after each step, as in the ground truth, for maximal rigor.

**Summary:** Only minor omissions in explanatory detail, but no factual or logical errors in the sequence or core explanation.
