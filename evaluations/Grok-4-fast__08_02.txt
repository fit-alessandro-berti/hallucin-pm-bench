The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" to Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] for Q2, with a concise explanation that accurately describes bypassing T3 to enable T5 (reaching {P2, P5}). This matches the ground truth's core content and sequence. However, it lacks the ground truth's detailed intermediate markings (M1–M5) and additional confirmation about T5 disabling T3 afterward, reducing thoroughness. Format is slightly less aligned (e.g., no step-by-step numbering), warranting a minor deduction despite brevity fitting the ≤120-word limit. No factual errors.
