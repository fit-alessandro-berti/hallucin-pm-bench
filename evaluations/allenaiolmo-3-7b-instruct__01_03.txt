### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Part a) – Major failures (drastic point deduction):**
- Ground truth identifies **exactly 2 decision points**: (1) the single conditional branch/skip rule combining risk + amount after Step 3 (one sentence), (2) TriVote gate (precise rule).
- LLM invents **6 decision points**, incorrectly splitting/combining steps, adding non-existent branches:
  1. Fabricates auto-rejection for High risk (process has no such rule; High risk → Step 5, not rejection).
  2. Splits the ground-truth #1 into separate "risk" and "amount" checks (distorts the single "if risk ∈ {Low, Medium} **AND** amount ≤ €250k" rule).
  3. Mischaracterizes Step 5 as a "decision point" (it's a procedural step triggered by the prior conditional, not a gate/branch).
  4. TriVote is partially accurate ("any two suffice" matches), but framed amid other errors.
  5-6. Invents Step 8/9 as decision gates with explicit rejections (process describes linear flow post-TriVote; no rejection rules stated for confirmation or finalization).
- Exceeds "one sentence each," adds extraneous details (e.g., "Deck Officer" role misplaced). Hallucinates process outcomes. **~70% inaccurate → severe deduction.**

**Part b) – Partial accuracy, but critical omissions/errors (heavy deduction):**
- Ground truth: **9 items**, precise order/distinctions (e.g., "Offer Sheet 77" separate from "Signed Offer Sheet 77"; ID Matrix after signed sheet).
- LLM: **8 items**, correct on most first appearances/scorecards, but:
  - Merges "Offer Sheet 77" + "Signed Offer Sheet 77" into one entry (misses "Signed" as distinct document in Step 8).
  - Wrong order: Lists "ID Matrix Declaration" (Step 8) after combined Offer Sheet, but ground truth sequences Signed Offer Sheet before ID Matrix.
  - Minor: Descriptions add unneeded context (e.g., "Used if...", "Signed by applicant..."), but not fatal.
- No KYC hallucination (positive). **~80% match → moderate deduction, but strictness penalizes missing item/order.**

**Overall:** LLM captures high-level flow/TriVote/docs backbone (~30% fidelity), but proliferates inventions, distortions, extras, and misses in both parts. Strict rubric (small errors = big loss) yields low score; not a "summary" or "list" matching ground truth structure/content.
