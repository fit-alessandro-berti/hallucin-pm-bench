7.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correctly identifies *all* changes (3 added tasks, 1 removed task, 1 gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive). Uses exact required headings. Ignores renamings (e.g., doesn't list "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan" or gateway name). No extraneous changes invented. Concise summary.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences/small errors)**:
  - **Missing IDs** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`, etc.): Ground truth includes precise BPMN IDs in backticks for *all* tasks—critical for a "meticulous process-mining analyst." Omission = -1.0 per section (added/removed/gateway).
  - **Gateway description**: Includes cosmetic name changes ("Eligible? → Eligibility Check"), violating "ignore cosmetic renamings." Uses generic "Exclusive/Inclusive" vs. precise BPMN "exclusive (XOR)/inclusive (OR)." No v1/v2 labels or ID. Format mismatch (→ vs. "changed from...to...") = -0.5.
  - **Formatting/structure**: Bullets (-) vs. numbered lists (1., 2.); plain names vs. **bold** + codes; no "## Expected Answer Key" header or closing note = -0.5 (strict visual/content fidelity).
- **Total**: Starts at 10.0, deducts 2.5 for precision omissions/errors → 7.5. Semantically strong but not "exact" match; small diffs (e.g., no IDs) cost dearly per instructions.
