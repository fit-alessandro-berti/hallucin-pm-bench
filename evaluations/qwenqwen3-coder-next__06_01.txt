The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines and Quality_Check — Create_Documentation), which aligns with the ground truth content and rationale. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Within-pair alphabetical order violated**: Second pair is reversed ("Quality_Check" before "Create_Documentation"; 'C' precedes 'Q').
- **Overall list alphabetical order violated**: Pairs listed as P-S then Q-C instead of C-Q then P-S.
- **Formatting differences**: No alignment of "—" (ground truth uses padding spaces for monospaced alignment, e.g., extra spaces before "—" in second pair); inconsistent spacing.
- **Minor**: No leading blank line or code block as in ground truth presentation.

These are direct violations of the prompt's explicit instructions on ordering and format, warranting a 50% score despite correct pair identification (significant deductions for each error per strict criteria).
