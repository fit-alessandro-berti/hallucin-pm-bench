The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without forbidden variants and maintains the required process activities and roles as rows/columns with no extras introduced. The overall structure is a valid RACI matrix with a legend. However, there are multiple significant mismatches in RACI allocations compared to the ground truth, which must reflect the narrative strictly (one Responsible per activity, Account Manager as Accountable where appropriate). Key errors include:

- **KYC Review**: Account Manager C (vs. A), Compliance Officer R/A (vs. R), Finance Clerk I (vs. C) — three differences, incorrectly combining R/A on performer and missing AM accountability.
- **Order Vetting**: Finance Clerk C (vs. I) — unwarranted consultation.
- **Payment Clearance**: Account Manager I (vs. A), Finance Clerk R/A (vs. R) — two differences, missing AM accountability and combining R/A incorrectly.
- **Record Update**: Finance Clerk I (vs. C), IT Support R/A (vs. R) — two differences, unwarranted R/A and missing consultation.
- **Notify Customer**: IT Support C (vs. I) — unwarranted consultation.

Only "Receive Application" matches fully. These 9 cell-level differences (out of 24), plus inconsistent R/A usage and failure to position AM as Accountable for KYC/Payment per narrative implications, indicate poor fidelity. Extra notes are minor but add unwarranted content. Under strict evaluation, this warrants substantial deduction despite terminology and format strengths.
