**2.0**

The LLM answer follows the output format (valid single-hunk unified diff and one-sentence rationale) and adheres to rules (modifies one existing attribute without adding/deleting elements), but earns a very low score due to utmost strictness against ground truth: it targets the completely wrong task (`Task_GrantAccess` vs. `Task_CollectEquipment`), applies the incorrect dueDate change (`P1D` → `P3D` vs. `P5D` → `P2D`), and provides an unrelated rationale (vendor lead times vs. overall 3-day SLA cycle). These are fundamental mismatches, not minor errors.
