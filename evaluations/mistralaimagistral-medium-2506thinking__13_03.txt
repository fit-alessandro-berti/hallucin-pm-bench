### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1 (Accuracy)**: Perfect match—both identify exactly 1 occurrence of "Manual Fraud Check" (in case 1002). No errors. (Full points.)
- **Part 2 (Explanation Quality and Fidelity to Ground Truth)**: The LLM answer correctly notes small sample size (3 cases), temporal bias (one day), non-representativeness, and naming variations, staying under 120 words overall. However, it lacks key ground truth elements: quantitative sampling error (e.g., one event swinging frequency 0%–7%, wide confidence intervals, rare event volatility); specific near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)"); and risks of strict vs. fuzzy matching. These omissions reduce depth and precision, introducing moderate differences under strict criteria. (Partial points: ~75% alignment.)

The response is concise, data-driven, and avoids speculation, but misses nuanced analytical insights from the ground truth, warranting a deduction.
