**9.5**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Line-by-Line Comparison to Ground Truth):
- **Q1/A1**: LLM: "**Answer: 3 distinct cases.**" vs. GT: "**3**". Factual match (correct count), but extra phrasing ("distinct cases") and structure (table + bold). Minor difference in conciseness/phrasing deducts 0.3 points.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact semantic and textual match ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"), including separators. Table adds accurate timestamps (not required, but factual). Perfect: full points.
- **Q3/A3**: Core list exact ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock", alpha-ordered, one per line). Matches prompt spec precisely. Minor format diffs (numbered + bold vs. bullet + <br>), plus explanatory table (accurate, no fabrication). Deducts 0.2 points for style deviation/verbosity.

**Overall**: Factually perfect (no errors, hallucinations, missing/extra items, or fabrications—all extras are verifiable from log). High marks for precision/correctness, minor deductions only for unasked verbosity, phrasing, and non-identical formatting under utmost strictness (total -0.5). Structure (headings/tables) enhances clarity but deviates from GT's minimal table.
