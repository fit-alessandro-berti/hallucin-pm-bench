**9.5**

The LLM answer is factually perfect: correctly identifies the fact as false ("No"), provides a short justification citing all relevant case IDs (1001, 1002, 1003) and key activities/sequences, accurately shows reversed ordering where both activities occur, and notes the absence in Case 1002 (disproving "always"). No guessing, strictly data-based.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for stylistic differences from ground truth under utmost strictness:
- No explicit line citations (ground truth has lines 3-4, 11&14).
- No final summary sentence reiterating "in none of the cases" (ground truth has it).
- "No." vs. structured "**Short verdict:** **inaccurate**"; case order slightly differs (1001/1003/1002 vs. 1001/1002/1003).

These are non-substantive but count as differences; no factual errors.
