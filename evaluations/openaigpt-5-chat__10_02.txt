3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Evaluating strictly against the ground truth answer as the benchmark, the LLM response shows partial adherence to the prompt's requirements but exhibits significant deviations in structure, content, and RACI assignments, warranting a low score. Key issues include:

- **Vocabulary and Terminology (Partial Match, -1.5 points)**: Correctly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") throughout tasks and roles, matching the ground truth's emphasis. However, task phrasings like "Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction" introduce unnecessary verbosity from the source, diverging slightly from the concise, mandated-style wording in the ground truth.

- **Table Structure and Format (Poor Match, -2.0 points)**: Both are Markdown RACI tables, but the LLM uses a task-numbered row format with R/A/C/I as columns, while the ground truth orients roles as columns with tasks as rows and letters (R/A/C/I) in cells, plus a legend. This is a valid alternative but not a match, and the LLM adds an unrequested "#" column and extra notes/offers (e.g., swimlane diagram), bloating the output beyond the prompt's "Put the table in Markdown" directive.

- **Task Coverage and Breakdown (Weak Match, -1.5 points)**: The LLM covers all source steps but incorrectly splits step 5 into two tasks ("Release payment after approval" and "Send SWIFT message") and adds a redundant #7, resulting in 7 tasks vs. ground truth's precise 6. This omits no content but introduces fragmentation not present in the ground truth (e.g., no separate "Send SWIFT message"; it's implied in "Release Payment"). Task names also differ (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**" – extra details and missing bolding).

- **RACI Assignments (Major Mismatch, -2.5 points)**: Assignments differ substantially across nearly all tasks, showing little fidelity to the ground truth:
  - Introduces only source-derived roles (e.g., IT Support) but omits the ground truth's "Operations Manager" entirely, a critical role in every row there – this fails to match the ground truth's role set.
  - Examples of deviations:
    - "Receive": LLM (TA: R/A; RL: I) vs. ground (TA: R; RL: I; Ops: A; IT: C) – misses Ops A and IT C, over-assigns A to TA.
    - "Screen": LLM (TA: R/A; RL: C) vs. ground (TA: R; RL: A; Ops: I; IT: C) – wrong A (TA vs. RL), misplaces C/I.
    - "KYC Review": LLM (RL: R/A; TA: C) vs. ground (TA: C; RL: R; Ops: A; IT: I) – misses Ops A and IT I, over-assigns A to RL.
    - Similar patterns for "Approve" and "Release" (e.g., no Ops A in LLM; misplaced C/I).
    - "Archive": LLM (IT: R/A; RL: C/I) vs. ground (TA: C; RL: I; Ops: A; IT: R) – adds unneeded TA absence, wrong C for RL, misses Ops A and TA C.
  - No coverage for implied consultations/informations in source (e.g., final notification only partially captured).

Overall, while the LLM correctly interprets the vocabulary mandate and produces a functional RACI table covering the source, it fails to align with the ground truth's specific structure, role inclusion, task consolidation, and precise assignments – core elements of the evaluation. Small errors (e.g., extra notes, phrasing) compound to significant deductions under strict criteria. A higher score would require near-exact replication of the ground truth's layout and content.
