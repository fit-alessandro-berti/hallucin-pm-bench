6.0

**Justification (strict evaluation):**

**Major errors:**
- The LLM answer *omits the “Operations Manager”* role, which is present in the ground truth and assigned as “Accountable” in every step.
- The LLM creates additional rows/tasks (e.g., combines “Send SWIFT message” as a step) rather than sticking exactly to the breakdown and verbatim titles as in the ground truth answer.
- The “Archive case file” step has incorrect RACI mapping compared to the ground truth.
- Sometimes, roles are left blank for certain columns instead of specifying all possible roles (ground truth covers all for each step).

**Moderate errors:**
- The "Accountable" party is *not* assigned as per the ground truth—in the LLM answer, accountability is usually self-assigned (e.g., the performing role), whereas in the ground truth, it's the Operations Manager for each task.
- Misplacement or absence of “Consulted” and “Informed” roles (e.g., for “KYC Review”, the Transaction Analyst should be Consulted, not Accountable/Responsible).
- The tasks/activities wording is mostly accurate but not always matched exactly to the ground truth ("Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system" vs "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs "Screen Against Sanctions List").

**Minor errors:**
- Some inclusion of explanatory notes and offer of further diagrams is extra (not penalized, but irrelevant).
- Phrasing in task listing is not as concise, and the step splitting is inconsistent versus ground truth.

**Vocabulary Compliance:**  
The LLM answer *does* use the mandated synonym terms throughout and does not violate the vocabulary restrictions.

**Summary:**  
The output structures a mostly valid RACI table, but fails significant requirements:
- It misses "Operations Manager" (Critical).
- Does not use *all* ground truth steps exactly.
- R/A/C/I allocations do not match exactly.
- Step names in many cases are not identical.
- Does not cover only those roles mandated in the ground truth.

Given these, but acknowledging it avoids synonym errors and generally uses the right roles/terms, a **6.0** is warranted. Parts are usable but the errors are substantial.
