9.7

- The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in both content and correctness.
- The wording of the answers is slightly different in formatting (the LLM uses “Distinct cases: 3 (C123, C456, C789)” instead of exactly “3 cases (C123, C456, C789)”, and "Activity preceding ..." rather than "Pack_Items"), but these are stylistic.
- The key information (values) are all correct, concise, and in bullet points.
- There is a minor formatting deviation (using colons after headings), which according to the criteria should result in a small but "significant" point loss, being assessed strictly.
