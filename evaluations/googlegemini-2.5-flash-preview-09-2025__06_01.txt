The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B, in the required alphabetical order both within pairs and in the overall list, with no extraneous pairs or references to Process A. The format matches the specified structure (one pair per line, using "Task_X â€” Task_Y"). However, under utmost strictness, there is a minor but noticeable formatting difference: the ground truth aligns the em dashes vertically by adding extra spaces after "Procure_Materials" in the second line (creating a columnar appearance), while the LLM answer uses uniform spacing without this alignment. This small discrepancy results in a significant point deduction, though the content is otherwise identical.
