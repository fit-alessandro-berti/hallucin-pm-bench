**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer correctly models the process flow, loop (gw3 → t3), and elements without hallucinating extras (e.g., no timers, parallel paths, or unmentioned tasks)—matching the description and GT structure/connectivity exactly. It uses concise IDs, 3 exclusive gateways (necessary for lines 3,5,8-9 despite "two decision points" phrasing), <40 lines for XML, and valid BPMN XML. Flow names directly echo text (e.g., "Password Reset", "Issue Persists").

However, **strict deductions for differences from GT** (significant loss per small error):
- **-1.0**: Extra content (mapping table, explanatory text)—violates "single `<definitions> … </definitions>` block".
- **-0.5**: t1 name "Classify Ticket" vs GT "Auto-Classification" (misses "automatically"; minor invention).
- **-0.5**: gw2 name "Resolve or Forward?" vs "Resolved Internally?" (semantic match but textual diff).
- **-0.5**: No `<conditionExpression>` on gateway outflows (GT specifies "yes"/"no"; LLM uses flow `name=` labels instead—functional but not identical).
- **-0.3**: ID/attribute diffs (e.g., `se`/`ee`/`p1`/isExecutable="true"/definitions `id`/`targetNamespace`).
- **-0.2**: Minor flow ID ordering (e.g., LLM f5=t3→gw2, f9=t2→t6; GT f5=t2→t6, f6=t3→gw2).

Core fidelity high (no invalid additions/missing elements), but cumulative diffs prevent >7.0 under utmost strictness. GT itself has minor issues (missing `xmlns:xsi` for `xsi:type`; interpretive names).
