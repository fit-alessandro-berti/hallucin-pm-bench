4.5

**Justification:**

- **Vocabulary Compliance:** The LLM answer strictly uses only the authorized vocabulary for activity names in the matrix itself; forbidden synonyms do not appear in the output. (+)
- **Activity Set:** The LLM introduces two unauthorized activities—“Treasury Ops Payment Scheduling” and “Notify Originating Analyst”—which are not listed in the ground truth, and omits “Release Funds” as precisely worded in the ground truth. (–1.5)
- **Mapping:** 
  - “Notify Originating Analyst” is not in the ground truth. 
  - “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Treasury Ops Payment Scheduling” is split, potentially duplicating or confusing steps from the ground truth's “Release Funds”. (–1.0)
- **RACI Assignment Errors:**
  - “Risk Scoring”: LLM marks Compliance Analyst as R/A and others as I, while ground truth has “A” with Compliance Officer, “R” with Compliance Analyst, “C” with Front-Office Analyst, “I” with Treasury Ops. (–1.0)
  - Consistent use of “R/A” as a shorthand is not explicitly sanctioned by the ground truth format, but mostly matches intent.
  - For “Intake Vetting”, LLM omits “C” for Compliance Analyst and “I” for Treasury Ops. (–1.0)
  - “KYC Review” and “AML Screening”: LLM omits “I” on Treasury Ops. (–0.5)
  - “Compliance Officer Approval”: LLM assigns “C” to Compliance Analyst (not present in ground truth), “I” to Front-Office and Treasury Ops (incorrect).
  - “Release Funds” (as “Treasury Ops Funds Release”): Missing “C” for both analysts, as in ground truth. (–0.5)
- **Formatting:** 
  - LLM uses a readable Markdown table, but differs from ground truth by not marking absence of involvement with “–” and always omitting “C” or “I” columns unless explicitly specified. (–0.25)

**Final assessment:**  
While the LLM output avoids forbidden synonyms and aligns terminology for the core authorized activities, it introduces unauthorized activities, misassigns/omits several RACI roles, and contains mapping and formatting deviations. Cumulative errors are significant but not catastrophic; thus, 4.5 is appropriate.
