3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects strict adherence to the prompt and ground truth (GT), penalizing deviations heavily as instructed. The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks, earning partial credit for compliance with the vocabulary policy. The table structure is mostly Markdown-compliant, and it attempts to cover roles from the roster.

However, major deductions for the following errors (each contributing to significant point loss):

- **Added unauthorized activities (severe violation of "do not ... add activities")**: The LLM introduces "Treasury Ops Payment Scheduling" and "Notify Originating Analyst", which are not in the GT and exceed the narrative's core activities. The GT merges scheduling/release into "Release Funds" and omits "Notify" entirely, sticking closer to the four mandated plus two derived essentials. This inflates the matrix unnecessarily (+2 extra rows), deviating from "covering every activity ... described above" without addition.

- **RACI assignments mismatch extensively (per-cell errors across ~70% of content)**: 
  - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst is "I" (should be "C"); missing Treasury "I" and Officer "–".
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office "I" (should be "–"); missing Treasury "I".
  - **AML Screening**: Identical errors to KYC Review.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office missing "C"; Compliance Analyst "R / A" (should be "R"); Officer "I" (should be "A"); Treasury "I" is correct but overshadowed by errors.
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Treasury "I" (should be "–").
  - Added rows have no GT equivalent, so inherently wrong (e.g., "Notify" assigns "R / A" to Treasury, unsupported).
  - Overall, ~12-15 cell-level inaccuracies vs. GT, including wrong roles (e.g., no "C" for Officer in added "Scheduling") and inconsistent escalation logic (narrative implies Officer accountability for high-risk approval, which GT captures better).

- **Formatting inconsistencies (minor but penalized per strictness)**: Uses "R / A" with slash (GT: "**R, A**" with comma and bold); blank cells instead of "–" for no involvement; no bolding of activities; extraneous title "RACI Matrix" (GT has none). These are small but compound to show non-exact replication.

The answer covers the process intent partially but fails on precision, addition prohibition, and fidelity to GT's streamlined 6 activities/assignments. At 10.0, it would match GT exactly; here, core structural and content flaws drag it to a low pass.
