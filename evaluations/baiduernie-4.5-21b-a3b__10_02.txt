1.0

The LLM answer fails almost entirely against the ground truth and prompt requirements, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key failures include:

- **Vocabulary mandate violations**: Uses forbidden terms throughout ("Payment Clerk" instead of "Transaction Analyst"; "Compliance Officer" instead of "Regulatory Liaison"; "customer due diligence (CDD)" instead of "KYC Review"). This alone is a core, non-negotiable breach, as the prompt demands *only* mandated terms.
- **Table structure and format mismatches**: Employs RACI labels as columns (Responsible, Accountable, etc.) instead of roles as columns (e.g., Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison). Lacks mandated task wording (e.g., no "KYC Review"). Includes redundant/misnumbered rows (duplicate 5s and 6s, unnecessary split for "Notify compliance officer"). No legend or explanatory notes as in ground truth.
- **Task coverage and mapping errors**: Incomplete consolidation of steps (e.g., separates SWIFT send and notification unnecessarily; omits proper rephrasing like "Receive Payment Instruction" or "Archive Record"). Adds invalid "Informed" entries without full RACI context.
- **RACI assignments**: Sparse and incorrect (mostly blanks or single entries; no comprehensive R/A/C/I distribution across roles like ground truth's inclusion of Operations Manager as Accountable). Does not reflect source text mappings accurately (e.g., screening consults wrong role).
- **Overall fidelity**: Ignores prompt to "cover every task, using *only* the mandated terms" and "organise the RACI matrix clearly." The output is disorganized, non-compliant, and diverges fundamentally from the ground truth's enforced structure and content. Even minor formatting issues (e.g., no bolding for roles) compound the deductions, but the violations are wholesale.
