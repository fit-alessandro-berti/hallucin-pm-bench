2.0

The answer has grave issues in terms of the explicit instructions in the prompt:

1. **Vocabulary Violation**: The response flagrantly ignores the vocabulary mandate. It repeatedly uses “Payment Clerk”, “Compliance Officer”, and “Customer Due Diligence (CDD)”, all of which are prohibited and must be replaced by “Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”, and “KYC Review” respectively. This is a fundamental error.

2. **Structure Deviation**: The answer copies the narrative task list rather than mapping each process to the mandated activity names (e.g., “KYC Review”). It doesn't clearly translate informal task phrasing into the standardized activities in the ground truth.

3. **Roles and RACI Assignments Missing or Incomplete**: 
   - The answer omits the “Operations Manager” role entirely, which is present in the ground truth (and is critical for a standard RACI). 
   - The “Accountable” column is left blank for every line, which is a major flaw. The ground truth clearly differentiates between “Responsible”, “Accountable”, etc., for each line.
   - “Consulted” and “Informed” are sparsely and poorly applied, not matching ground truth (e.g., notification/informing steps are missing or misapplied).

4. **Tasks Not Mapped to Mandated Activities**: Instead of restating the activities per the enforced vocabulary, it just rewrites narrative steps; e.g., “Perform customer due diligence (CDD) check” instead of “KYC Review”.

5. **Clarity and Organization**: The table does not follow the concise, activity-based structure required, and does not use the correct activity/role wording in the headers or cells.

Even with the correct number of tasks, the answer completely fails on the critical requirement of vocabulary enforcement and does not correctly structure RACI responsibilities.

**Conclusion**: These are serious faults: the output is not in compliance and would not be usable in a process documentation context. As such, only a minimal score (2.0) is warranted.
