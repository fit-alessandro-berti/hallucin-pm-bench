**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually precise, complete, and correctly formatted across all questions, with no errors, omissions, fabrications, or hallucinations. Core answers match the ground truth verbatim (accounting for minor non-semantic formatting like backticks, bolding, or bullets vs. code block):

- **Q1/A1**: Exact match (3 distinct cases).
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match, using required "→" separator.
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered.

Explanatory content is accurate and supplementary, not differing from ground truth requirements.
