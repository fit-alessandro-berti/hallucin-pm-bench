**9.5**

**Justification:**

- **Question 1:** Correctly states "1 time". No error.
- **Question 2:**  
    - a) Correct calculation and rounding (**2.08%**).  
    - b) Correct calculation and rounding (**8.33%**).
- **Question 3:**  
    - The answer correctly states the low frequency, potential for skew, and mentions sample size ("small sample"), though it doesn't use the exact phrase "single observation."  
    - It cautions about variance/instability ("harder to reliably discern its true effect...") and warns against generalisation.
    - However, it could more explicitly state the unique risk of instability introduced by basing analysis on a single case/event, which is specifically called out in the ground truth as needed (i.e., mention of "single occurrence" or "one observation"). This is a *minor* omission, leading to a small deduction.

**Deduction rationale:** The only flaw is the lack of explicit mention that all analysis about "Manual_Fraud_Check" in this log is based on a *single instance*. Otherwise, the reasoning is correct, concise, and complete. No factual or calculation errors.

**Strict score:** 9.5
