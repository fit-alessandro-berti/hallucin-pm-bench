8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). Full credit.
- **Question 2a/b**: Exact matches to ground truth calculations and formatting (2.08% and 8.33%, with correct rounding to two decimals). Full credit.
- **Question 3**: The response is concise (78 words, under limit), uses only log data, and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "if generalised," "small sample"). It notes instability indirectly via "skew analyses," "underestimation," "inaccurate predictions," and "harder to reliably discern." However, it fails to explicitly mention the "single-occurrence issue" in the explanation (relies on implicit percentage from 2b, without stating "only once" or emphasizing one observation's vulnerability to noise/skewing averages, as required). This is a small but clear omission under strict criteria, warranting a deduction. The focus on performance/predictions is relevant but less precise than ground truth's emphasis on statistical unreliability (e.g., wide confidence intervals).

Overall, the answer is strong and deterministic where required, but the explanatory shortfall in (3) prevents a perfect score.
