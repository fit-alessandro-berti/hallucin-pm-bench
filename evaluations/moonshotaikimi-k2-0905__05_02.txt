3.0

The LLM answer changes the due date of **"Sign Contract"** from 3 days (P3D) to 1 day (P1D), instead of the expected action: reducing the due date of **"Collect Equipment"** from 5 days to 2 days (P2D). This is a significant deviation from the ground truth answer.

Errors contributing to point loss:
- Chooses the wrong task to modify: Modifies "Sign Contract" instead of "Collect Equipment".
- Sets a much stricter SLA (24h) for "Sign Contract" than required, which may not solve the actual SLA breach root cause.
- The rationale refers to eliminating the "biggest single-cycle delay," yet the largest delay is in "Collect Equipment" (P5D), not "Sign Contract" (P3D), demonstrating a misunderstanding of the process bottleneck.
- Output format is correct (unified diff and one sentence rationale).
- The change itself is syntactically correct according to the allowed modifications.

Partial credit for:
- Modifying only an allowed attribute according to rules.
- Correct output format.

Due to strictness requested and the critical misidentification of the correct remediation, this merits a low score.
