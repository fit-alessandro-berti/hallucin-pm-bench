6.0

R1: Correct—compliant, and proper justification.
R2: Incorrect—should be Violated. The LLM incorrectly says Ship_Goods was within 2 days of Finance Approval, but per the rules, after a Change_Request occurs after approval, a new Manager_Approval is required, and Ship_Goods must be within 2 days after the last required approval (the new Manager_Approval on 07-Mar, but Ship_Goods was before that).
R3: Correct—Violated, justification is apt.
R4: Correct—Not Applicable due to hazardous = false.
R5: Correct—Violated, justification is accurate and concise.
R6: Correct—Compliant, reasoning is sufficient.

Grading rationale: The biggest error is in R2—misreading when the "last required approval" was, which is a significant process misunderstanding. All other assessments match precisely. Such a misinterpretation is significant and warrants a notable deduction. Justifications are clear and concise, which is positive. Strict grading per instructions: significant error (R2), all else correct → 6.0.
