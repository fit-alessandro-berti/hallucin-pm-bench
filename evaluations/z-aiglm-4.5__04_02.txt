The LLM answer correctly identifies compliance for R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6 with appropriate statuses and concise justifications (all â‰¤20 words). The overall result is accurate. However, R2 is a major error: it incorrectly deems the rule Compliant (missing the impact of the post-change new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07 as the "last required approval," making Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 untimely and pre-approval), with flawed justification focusing only on initial approvals. This critical misinterpretation of rule dependencies and timeline violates strict evaluation criteria, warranting a significant deduction despite format adherence.
