7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (Perfect, no deduction)**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). No extras, no omissions, no unchanged elements mentioned, no commentary—fully adheres to verifiable differences only.
- **Headings (Perfect, no deduction)**: Exact verbatim match and order (ADDED TASKS, REMOVED TASKS, GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES).
- **Formatting Errors (Significant deduction: -2.5 points)**:
  - Tasks and gateways lack bullet points ("- ") present in ground truth, making lists inconsistent (strict loss for structural deviation in output format).
  - Gateways incorrectly include guillemets (« ») around types ("«exclusive → parallel»"), violating the prompt's example format ("Gateway_X: exclusive → parallel") and ground truth— this is a clear extraneous addition.
  - Second gateway line lacks alignment spaces after ":" in ground truth ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"), adding a minor but verifiable visual/structural mismatch.
- **Overall Strictness**: Content is flawless, but formatting deviations (bullets, guillemets, alignment) are small yet non-negligible errors in a highly prescriptive prompt, warranting a substantial penalty per instructions. Score reflects near-excellence tempered by format strictness.
