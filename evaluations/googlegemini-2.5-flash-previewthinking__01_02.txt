8.0

The LLM answer is mostly correct, but there are a few notable issues that merit a strict reduction:

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM answer names all three required decision points and uses the correct activity names.
- However, it is not specific about the placement/sequence (it does not clarify that "Amount Threshold Decision" comes after "Neighbourhood Feedback Check")—while it implies sequencing, it does not explicitly anchor the activity as clearly as the ground truth.
- Descriptions are accurate but slightly more general; e.g., it says “proceed to step 8” without clarifying “send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval,” and doesn't explicitly state amounts < €15 000 are “system auto-approved.”
- The decision logic is otherwise accurate: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, MBA.

**Required Documents:**
- The LLM answer lists all required documents, using the correct document names and order.
- Wording for some documents is a bit more elaborate (e.g., “single pay-stub or tax slip” instead of simply “pay-stub/tax slip”), but these do not alter the meaning.
- The answer does not explicitly mention that no other standard loan documents are required (such as stating “no credit bureau report or collateral”), which is helpful context provided in the ground truth.

**Terminology:** 
- The LLM sticks to the prescribed activity names and does not introduce standard loan jargon.

**Strict Penalty Justification:**
- Omissions in specifying sequencing of “Amount Threshold Decision” reduce clarity.
- Lack of the explicit exclusion clause (“no credit bureau report, collateral forms...”) means possible minor ambiguity about additional documents.
- The phrasing of “proceed to step 8” instead of “send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval” is less precise and misses the direct mapping to the named activity.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is highly accurate in substance but misses a few important details of clarity and completeness, so a strict evaluation settles at **8.0**.
