The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth on questions 1 and 2 (exact counts and percentages, with correct calculations). For question 3, it adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (62 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue ("1 event, 1 case"), notes variance/instability (e.g., "overemphasizing rare manual interventions," "biased models"), and cautions against over-generalization ("generalizing could mislead... ignores dominant patterns"), fulfilling all required elements without invention or deviation from the log.
