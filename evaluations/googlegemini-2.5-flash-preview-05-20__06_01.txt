8.5

The LLM answer lists the correct task pairs that can be executed in parallel:  
- Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check  
- Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

However, the answer does not follow the required formatting strictly: in the second pair, the required number of spaces between the task names and the dash ("—") is not respected. The prompt and ground truth example specify two or more spaces of padding on both sides of the dash; the LLM provides only one. This is a small but definite formatting error, and as per the guideline, small errors should significantly affect the grade. No other content issues are present.

Thus, 8.5 is an appropriately strict score.
