**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision Points (major differences, ~50% match, -4.0 deduction)**: Ground truth identifies **3 explicit decision points** with precise naming, table format, branching logic (including rejection outcomes), and ties to activities (e.g., #1: *Eligibility check* in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility with reject branch; #3: *Final payment approval*). LLM identifies only **2**, misses triage eligibility entirely (core early decision implied by "Validate_Eligibility" checking manifests/reports), frames high-value correctly but simplifies gate as unnamed "Pre-Process_Refund_Payment gate" without rejection logic or table structure. Introduces minor unneeded detail ("otherwise, skips to Process_Refund_Payment").
- **Required Documents (minor differences, -1.0 deduction)**: Lists all 7 correctly, but lacks ground truth's numbering, AuditTrail caveat ("only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue"), closing parenthetical note, and omits "signed" qualifier matching process (LLM adds it accurately but format differs). No extras introduced.
- **Overall Structure/Completeness (-0.5 minor)**: Lacks table, headings differ (### vs **bold**), no rejection paths or full process fidelity. Partial accuracy but significant omissions/mismatches justify strict mid-low score. No policy violations.
