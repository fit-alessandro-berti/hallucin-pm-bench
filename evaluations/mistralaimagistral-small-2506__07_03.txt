### Evaluation Rationale
- **Factual Accuracy (Major Deduction)**: The LLM incorrectly identifies the old type of `Gateway_ReviewNeeded` as "inclusive" instead of "exclusive" (as per BPMN_v1 XML: `<exclusiveGateway>`). This is a verifiable error in the XML, violating the "list only verifiable differences" rule and introducing false information. The second gateway is correct. This alone warrants a significant penalty under strict evaluation, as it misrepresents a core change.
- **Format and Structure (Moderate Deduction)**: Headings are not verbatim (uses bold Markdown `**` instead of plain text like the ground truth). Tasks lack bullet points (`-`) used in the ground truth for listing multiple items, appearing as plain lines instead. Gateway entries lack alignment spacing (e.g., no padding after `Gateway_Payment`). The prompt specifies exact formatting for entries (e.g., `id` followed by name in parentheses, and `*«old type → new type»*` style, though ground truth simplifies to `:` and `→` without guillemets—LLM matches this simplification but errs on content).
- **Completeness (Minor Strengths)**: All added tasks (3 correct) and the single removed task are accurately identified with proper `id (name)` format. No extraneous commentary or unchanged elements mentioned, adhering to "only the three headings and concrete differences."
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the factual error is disqualifying (e.g., -3.0 points), format inconsistencies add another deduction (e.g., -2.0), despite correct elements in ~75% of content. A perfect match would be 10.0; this is substantially flawed.
