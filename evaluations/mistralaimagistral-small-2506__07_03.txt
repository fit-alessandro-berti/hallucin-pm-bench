6.5

Rationale for strict scoring:

- The LLM answer omits the dash ("- ") before each task, while the ground truth lists tasks with dashes. Even though this is a formatting error, your instructions demand utmost strictness, so this is a minor but non-negligible deduction.
- The order and grouping of the headings is correct; all relevant changes are present.
- The gateway type change for Gateway_ReviewNeeded is mistakenly listed as "inclusive → parallel" when, per the XML, it should be "exclusive → parallel"—this is a substantive factual error (likely a misreading or a typo) and a major deduction.
- The naming and use of parentheses for tasks is correct; however, the tasks are missing the dash bullet point as in the ground truth, which impacts accuracy per the instructions.
- The "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" for Gateway_Payment is correctly captured.
- Headings are not exactly verbatim as in the ground truth (missing dashes for the gateway change items).

Summary:

- Major deduction for the gateway type change (spurious "inclusive").
- Minor deduction for not following output list formatting exactly.
- Otherwise, coverage and grouping are correct.

Thus, 6.5 reflects these significant but not comprehensive errors.
