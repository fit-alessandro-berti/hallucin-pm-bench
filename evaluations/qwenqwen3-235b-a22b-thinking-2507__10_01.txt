### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy, using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exclusively without any forbidden terms, and it structures the matrix with activities as rows and roles as columns. However, it deviates significantly from the ground truth in RACI allocations, completeness, and extraneous content, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Correctness of RACI Allocations (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: 
  - Responsible (R) assignments partially align (e.g., CO for KYC Review, FC for Payment Clearance, IT for Record Update, AM for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Notify Customer), reflecting the process narrative. However, Accountable (A) is incorrectly assigned to AM for Record Update (ground truth: C, implying no explicit A or different accountability). All activities have exactly one R, which matches the notes.
  - Critical failure: No Consulted (C) or Informed (I) entries are included, leaving ~70% of cells blank instead of populating with ground truth values (e.g., CO: C for Order Vetting; FC: C for KYC Review; multiple I's across activities like IT: I for Receive Application). This renders the matrix incomplete and non-compliant with full RACI standards as shown in ground truth. AM's A is appropriate in 5/6 activities but undermined by the Record Update error and overall omissions.
  - Each activity lacks the exact bolded formatting (e.g., **R / A**) and cell-specific entries from ground truth.

- **Unwarranted Content (Moderate Deduction: -1.5 points)**: 
  - Introduces a "Key" section explaining R/A/C/I, which is absent in ground truth.
  - Adds a "**Terminology compliance**" subsection with explanatory notes and quotes referencing "formerly termed" phrases (e.g., "formerly termed 'Customer Due Diligence'"), which violates the policy's strict rule against mentioning forbidden terms "even in brackets or quotes." This is extraneous and introduces prohibited vocabulary indirectly.
  - No extra tasks or roles, but the header "*(Activities as rows, roles as columns; terminology strictly aligned with policy)*" and overall verbosity add unneeded self-referential content.

- **Formatting and Presentation (Moderate Deduction: -0.5 points)**: 
  - Table structure is similar (Markdown-compatible), but column headers abbreviate roles (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") while ground truth uses full names without abbreviations. Cells combine A/R in one entry (e.g., "A, R") instead of ground truth's "**R / A**" or separate indicators. Blanks for unspecified roles contrast with ground truth's explicit C/I entries.

The answer captures ~40% of the ground truth's essence (terminology and partial R's), but incompleteness, errors, and extras prevent a passing score. With utmost strictness, even minor additions like the compliance note count as violations, leading to this score.
