5.5

- **Vocabulary compliance:** The LLM answer is perfect—no forbidden terms appear, and the preferred synonyms are precisely and consistently used.
- **Format:** The layout (table, legends) is clear and correct.
- **Content:**
   - It correctly maps activities to the new terminology (Receive Application, KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, Record Update, Notify Customer).
   - **Major issues in RACI allocations:**
     - **Receive Application:** LLM assigns both Accountable (A) and Responsible (R) to Account Manager; omits C (CO), I (FC, IT).
     - **KYC Review:** LLM makes Compliance Officer only Responsible (correct) but Account Manager only Accountable (should be A, which matches, but omits C/I).
     - **Order Vetting:** LLM makes Account Manager A/R (but omits C/I roles).
     - **Payment Clearance:** LLM makes Account Manager Accountable, Finance Clerk Responsible, omits C/I.
     - **Record Update:** LLM gives AM Accountable (should be C), IT Responsible (good), omits C/I.
     - **Notify Customer:** LLM gives AM A/R (should be R/A), omits I roles.
   - Across the board, the LLM omits nearly all C (Consulted) and I (Informed) designations, which are present in the ground truth.
   - LLM also violates its own ‘one Accountable per activity’ in some cases, but the ground truth combines R/A for a single person, so that's acceptable. Still, the allocations simply do not reflect the ground truth's detail.
- **Conclusion:** The answer uses the mandated terms perfectly but loses significant marks (over 40%) by neglecting Consulted/Informed columns and not matching the correct RACI assignments. There are no forbidden terms or unwarranted roles/tasks, so the score is not lower. 

**Score justification:** Vocabulary perfect, table correct, but numerous factual errors in RACI allocations—thus, 5.5.
