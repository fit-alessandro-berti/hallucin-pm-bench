The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in all key aspects: it precisely identifies the absence of event rows and timestamps in Artefact A (the event log), explains why cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval cannot be computed for “Approve Invoice” (no durations possible), remains concise in one short paragraph, avoids guesses or external knowledge, and adheres to plain text format. Stylistic variations (e.g., phrasing like "mathematically undefined" vs. "dispersion," or "I cannot compute" vs. "Impossible") are negligible and do not alter correctness or completeness under strict evaluation.
