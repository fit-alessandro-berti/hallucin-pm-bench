The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). It adheres to the required format for IDs and names, uses the exact phrasing for changes (e.g., "exclusive → parallel"), and includes only the three headings with no extraneous commentary or unchanged elements.

Minor deductions (0.5 points total) for small formatting inconsistencies: extra blank lines after each heading (not present in ground truth) and lack of text alignment in the second gateway line (ground truth uses spaces after the colon in "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" to vertically align with the first line, while LLM uses a single space). These are superficial but penalized per strict evaluation criteria.
