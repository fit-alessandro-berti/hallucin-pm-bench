The LLM answer fully matches the ground truth across all three questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the exact sequence without deviations; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) one per line in alphabetical order, with no extras, omissions, or hallucinations. Explanatory content does not introduce factual errors and aligns with the required outputs.
