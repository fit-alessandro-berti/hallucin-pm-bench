The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for Q1â€“Q4. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list, as this activity does appear as the first event in case C-77. This factual error in the list (adding an extraneous valid first activity) represents a clear deviation from the ground truth, warranting a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria, despite the partial correctness of the other items in Q5.
