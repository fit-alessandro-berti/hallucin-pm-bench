7.0

The LLM answer is mostly correct, but there is an error in Q5:

- Q1 (3): Correct.
- Q2 ("Pack_Items"): Correct.
- Q3 (2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00): Correct.
- Q4 (2): Correct.
- Q5: LLM output is ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order", "Quality_Check"]. However, "Quality_Check" does appear as the first event for case "C-77", so it should NOT be included. The correct answer is ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]. The error is the incorrect inclusion of "Quality_Check".

This single mistake is significant since the question directly tests attention to detail in identifying first events by case. According to your strict scoring guideline, even a single wrong entry in a list should significantly penalize the score.

Thus: 10 (perfect) - 3 (substantive error in Q5) = 7.0

All other answers are correct, so the score is not lower.
