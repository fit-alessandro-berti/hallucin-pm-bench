The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth answer exactly for all three questions:

- **A1:** Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases.
- **A2:** Lists the sequence for C002 as "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" — matches ground truth.
- **A3:** Lists "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock", correctly alphabetized, as activities immediately preceding "Ship_Order" across all cases.

There are no errors or omissions.
