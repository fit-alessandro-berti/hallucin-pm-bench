The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, sequence, and ordering for all questions. A1 is identical. A2 is identical, including activity names and separators (escaping in ground truth is a presentation artifact). A3 lists the two distinct preceding activities correctly, one per line, alphabetically ordered (Arrange_Delivery before Check_Stock), adhering to the prompt's format without extraneous elements. No errors, hallucinations, or deviations.
