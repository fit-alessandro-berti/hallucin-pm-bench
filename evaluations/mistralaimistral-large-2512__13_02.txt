**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match:  
- Q1: Exact (1).  
- Q2a/b: Exact calculations, formatting, and values (2.08%, 8.33%; minor symbol/style diffs like / vs. ÷ or % spacing are negligible).  
- Q3: ≤100 words (70); hits all criteria—(i) single occurrence ("1/12 cases"), (ii) variance/instability ("skewing analyses", "overrepresenting rare paths", "misattribute...infrequent step"), (iii) over-generalisation ("Generalizing from sparse data can distort...biased predictions"). Explanation is accurate, data-bound, process-mining relevant (e.g., cycle time, predictions). No inventions/errors.
