9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
This evaluation is based on a strict, line-by-line comparison to the ground truth, penalizing any deviation (including format, wording, or extraneous content) as a potential sign of inference or hallucination. The LLM answer is highly accurate on core content but incurs a deduction for the parenthetical addition in Q4, which introduces unsubstantiated inferences (e.g., sampling methodology and representativeness of case volume) not derivable from the log lines.

- **Q1 (weight: 25%)**: Exact match ("1" vs. "1 occurrence"). No penalty. Score: 10.0.
- **Q2 (weight: 25%)**: Exact match (5.56% with equivalent calculation). No penalty. Score: 10.0.
- **Q3 (weight: 25%)**: Exact match (A1002 vs. "Only case A1002"). Minor wording difference ("contain" vs. "contains") is stylistic and not substantive. Score: 10.0.
- **Q4 (weight: 25%)**: Core two reasons align perfectly with ground truth options ("Temporal bias" and "Small sample size"). Explanations are clear and derived from the log (e.g., single-day window, 18 events). However, the parenthetical note adds two unjustified inferences ("lack of random/stratified sampling" and non-representativeness of four cases for monthly volume), violating the "no inference" rule. This is a small but clear deviation, warranting a significant deduction. Score: 7.0.

**Overall Weighted Score**: (10.0 × 0.25) + (10.0 × 0.25) + (10.0 × 0.25) + (7.0 × 0.25) = 9.0. The answer is otherwise concise, structured, and faithful to the log.
