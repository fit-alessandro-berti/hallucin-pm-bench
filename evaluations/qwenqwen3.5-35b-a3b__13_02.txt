**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in values, calculations implied, rounding (two decimals), and percentages, including parenthetical clarifications. For question 3 (71 words ≤100), it explicitly addresses single-occurrence ("once", "one instance"), variance/instability ("lacks variance", "scarcity prevents distinguishing...noise", "cannot reflect population behavior", "lack statistical reliability"), and over-generalisation ("overfitting C05’s context", "incorrectly treat...as universal", "misrepresent", "skewing insights"). All content derives strictly from the log (e.g., C05, 11/12 Auto_Fraud_Check). No inventions, errors, or deviations.
