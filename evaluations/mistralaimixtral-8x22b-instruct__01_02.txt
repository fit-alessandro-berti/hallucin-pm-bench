6.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Decision Points (major deductions: ~4 points lost)**: LLM identifies only 2/3 key points from ground truth. Misses **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** entirely as a standalone decision point (board votes approve/reject). Lacks precise contextual placement ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). Omits underwriter names ("Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B"). Minor phrasing diffs ("proceed" vs "continue"; no "tie-break"; "points" bolded unnecessarily). Incomplete summary = significant failure.
- **Required Documents (minor deductions: ~0.5 points lost)**: All 6 listed correctly, no extras/missing. But phrasing variances: "≤ 3 months old" vs "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs "pay-stub/tax slip" (extra "single"/"Latest" in title ok but parens mismatch); "CIS template" vs "CIS" (extra "template"). No numbering (GT uses 1-6). Misses GT's explanatory note (even if optional).
- **Overall Structure/Formatting (-0.5)**: Different headers (###/** vs ####), bullets vs numbered list, inconsistent bolding.
- **Strictness Applied**: Major omission (missing decision point) = heavy penalty; small phrasing/formatting errors compound loss. ~60% fidelity → 6.0.
