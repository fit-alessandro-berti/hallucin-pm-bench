### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, faithfully capturing all three decision points with precise terminology from the process (e.g., exact activity names like "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)"). It correctly describes the conditions and flows without introducing forbidden standard loan terminology. The document list matches the prompt's wording exactly, including details like "single pay-stub or tax slip" and "CIS template," which the ground truth slightly abbreviates or omits (e.g., "pay-stub/tax slip" and "CIS" without "template").

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Structural differences: Uses markdown headers and bullets/sub-bullets instead of the ground truth's numbered lists and arrow-based phrasing (e.g., "â‡’ continue"), introducing slight verbosity (e.g., "proceed to Disburse Funds" and "process ends without disbursement" are logically implied but not in ground truth's concise format).
- Omits the ground truth's parenthetical note on excluded documents, which adds emphasis but isn't required by the prompt.

No major errors; substance aligns 95%+ with ground truth under strict scrutiny.
