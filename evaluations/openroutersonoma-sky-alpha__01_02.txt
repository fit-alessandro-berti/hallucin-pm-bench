8.0

The LLM answer is accurate in terms of sequencing, terminology, and details, with only minor issues:

**Strengths:**
- All three decision points are listed, using the process activity names ("Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)").
- Each decision point is explained with correct branching logic, placed at the correct steps.
- All required documents are listed, using the exact document names and brief descriptions.

**Minor issues:**
- In the decision points summary, the answer does not explicitly place "Amount Threshold Decision" after "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)", though it is implied. Stating the specific sequence would be preferable for strict accuracy.
- "Process ends without disbursement" for a rejection is mentioned only in the MBA bullet, but the ground truth is more concise.
- In the documents, "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds the word "template," slightly diverging from the ground truth, which just says "Community Impact Statement (CIS)".
- The summary includes minor rephrasing ("proceed to Disburse Funds") rather than exact step names.

**Conclusion:**  
These minor issues collectively warrant a deduction, as per the strict grading instructions, but the logic, flow, and terminology are very close to the ground truth. Thus, the answer earns an **8.0**.
