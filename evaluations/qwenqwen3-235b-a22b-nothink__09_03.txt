The LLM answer is correct in stating that the metrics cannot be computed due to missing data in the event log and referencing what is present in Artefact B. It clearly explains the need for event timestamps and individual durations in order to calculate the requested metrics. The reasoning aligns well with the ground truth, emphasizing that absent data prevents calculation.

Strictly, some points are lost because the LLM answer slightly exceeds the strict brevity of the ground truth and references the SLA for completeness, but this does not affect the factual correctness. Additionally, while the LLM gives a comprehensive justification, the ground truth is even more focused on the explicit requirement for timestamps for “Approve Invoice,” and notes that additional raw log data are required. These are very minor differences, meriting a one-point deduction.
