**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, + minor credit)**: Uses exact mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) with no synonyms or leaks. Matches ground truth here.
- **Structure and activities (major violations, - heavy penalty)**:
  - Added unauthorized activities: "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst" (not in ground truth; violates "do not ... add activities"). Ground truth has exactly 6 rows; LLM has 8.
  - Missing merge/interpretation alignment: Ground truth consolidates process flow into 6 activities without separate "Schedule" or "Notify."
- **RACI assignments (catastrophic mismatch, - severe penalty)**: No row fully matches ground truth. Examples:
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | LLM: Front R only. GT: Front **R,A** + Comp C + Treas I. Misses A/C/I. |
  | KYC Review | LLM: Comp R only. GT: Comp **R,A** + Off C + Treas I. Misses A/C/I. |
  | AML Screening | Identical mismatch to KYC. |
  | Risk Scoring | LLM: Comp R only. GT: Front C + Comp R + Off **A** + Treas I. Misses all C/A/I. |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | LLM: Off A only. GT: Front I + Comp C + Off **R,A**. Misses R/I/C. |
  | Release Funds | LLM: Treas R only. GT: Front I + Comp C + Off C + Treas **R,A**. Misses all I/C/A. |
  - Ignores pervasive C/I/A patterns in ground truth (e.g., chain-of-custody I/C across roles).
- **Formatting (errors, - penalty)**: Uses "N/A" (vs. ground truth's "–" dash). No bolding of activities or **R,A**. Simpler header without alignment dashes. Extra rows disrupt table.
- **Overall**: ~80%+ cell-level differences + structural additions = near-total deviation. Strict policy demands major deductions; partial vocabulary/roles credit prevents 1.0.
