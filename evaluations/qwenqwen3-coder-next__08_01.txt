**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correctness (full marks: 10/10)**: Final answer correctly states **Yes**, provides a valid minimal firing sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** from initial marking, verifies enabling conditions (p3=1, p4=0), shows relevant markings, and confirms T3 has not fired yet. Also mentions extension to T3 afterward. No factual errors in net behavior or inhibitor arc interpretation.
- **Completeness (9/10)**: Addresses prompt fully (yes + sequence + brief justify). Markings are explicit and accurate. Justification covers enabling and sequence validity.
- **Differences from Ground Truth (-1.5 total penalty)**:
  - **Structure/Clarity (-1.0)**: Rambling, contradictory (starts with "**No.**" + partial proof, then self-corrects with "Wait", "Hold on", "why did I initially say 'no'?", backtracking). Unprofessional for "certified Petri-net analyst"; confuses reader vs. ground truth's clean, linear list.
  - **Insight/Justification Depth (-0.5)**: Misses ground truth's key proof that T5 **must** fire before T3 (if ever; p4 token from T3 disables T5 irreversibly). LLM only shows possibility, not necessity/impossibility of reverse.
- **Strictness Applied**: Messy reasoning/stream-of-consciousness = significant deduction (poor polish, risks misleading). No small errors overlooked, but core delivery salvages high score. Perfect match would be 10.0.
