The LLM answer partially matches the ground truth but contains a critical error on R2 (incorrectly deems Compliant instead of Violated, failing to account for the new approval after Change_Request as the final one, leading to Ship_Goods not being within 2 days post-final approval). This misses a key rule interplay, resulting in incomplete violation identification despite correct overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion. R1, R3–R6 match in status and have acceptable (≤20-word) justifications with minor phrasing differences; format is mostly compliant but includes extraneous initial reasoning. Strict deduction for the major R2 discrepancy and partial justification precision.
