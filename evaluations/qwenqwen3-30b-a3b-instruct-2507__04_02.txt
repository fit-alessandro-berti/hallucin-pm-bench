5.5

**Evaluation and Justification:**

- **R1**: Correct. Both LLM and ground truth find it **Compliant** for the right reason.
- **R2**: Incorrect. LLM says **Compliant**, but ground truth says **Violated**. LLM failed to account for the Change_Request event that invalidates earlier approvals and shifts the compliance window; it should have recalculated the 2-day interval from the second Manager_Approval, not the initial approvals. This is a significant mistake.
- **R3**: Correct. Both identify the rule as **Violated**â€”justification is accurate.
- **R4**: Correct. Both answer **Not Applicable** with justification matching reality.
- **R5**: Correct. Both say **Violated**, with sufficient explanation.
- **R6**: Correct. Both mark as **Compliant** and give the right reasoning.
- **Overall result**: Correct: **NON-COMPLIANT**, although the LLM cited violations in R3 and R5, missing the violation in R2, which affects the explanation quality for the overall result.

**Strict mark-down reasoning:**  
- The major error on R2, a critical process misunderstanding, warrants a severe penalty.  
- The answer is clearly presented and accurate for other rules, but such a process rule mistake is a serious flaw for an auditor.
- Multiple redundant or conversational lines in the LLM answer ("Wait, sequence is valid") are also a minor markdown.

**Score:** 5.5/10 (Major error in rule assessment, but significant portions correct, and the answer format is acceptable.)
