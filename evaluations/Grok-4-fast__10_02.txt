### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a low score. Key differences include:

- **Structure and Completeness**: The LLM introduces 8 tasks (e.g., separate "Send SWIFT message" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison"), while the ground truth has exactly 6 tasks mapped directly from the source without splitting or additions. This results in omissions (e.g., no equivalent to ground truth's consolidated mapping) and extraneous elements, violating the prompt's requirement to "cover every task" without substitutions or omissions.
  
- **Roles**: The LLM uses only 3 columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting the "Operations Manager" role present in the ground truth, which serves as the primary Accountable (A) party across tasks. This fundamentally alters the RACI assignments and ignores the ground truth's role distribution.

- **Task Wording and Mandated Vocabulary**: While the LLM correctly uses "**KYC Review**" once, other tasks lack the ground truth's precise phrasing (e.g., LLM's "Receive and log customer's transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; no bolding for mandated terms like "**KYC Review**"). The LLM also uses non-mandated phrasings like "Archive the case file" (vs. "Archive Record") and adds unmapped notifications/SWIFT, failing the "enforced vocabulary exactly" and "maps every step...without omissions" criteria.

- **RACI Assignments**: Nearly all assignments differ substantially (e.g., for "Screen Against Sanctions List," LLM assigns R/A to Transaction Analyst, while ground truth assigns R to Transaction Analyst and A to Regulatory Liaison; similar mismatches for KYC Review, Release Payment, and Archive). The LLM over-relies on R/A combinations without the ground truth's nuanced distribution (e.g., frequent A to Operations Manager, C/I to others). The final row ("Notify Regulatory Liaison") is malformed (empty cells, unclear R/A placement), further reducing clarity.

- **Formatting and Additional Elements**: No legend (present in ground truth), inconsistent Markdown (e.g., trailing empty cells), and absence of the ground truth's explanatory note on vocabulary adherence. These small errors compound to show non-compliance with "organise the RACI matrix clearly."

The LLM captures basic mandated terms (e.g., Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, KYC Review) and produces a Markdown table, earning minimal points for partial adherence, but the cumulative deviations in mapping, accuracy, and fidelity to the source/ground truth justify a near-minimal score.
