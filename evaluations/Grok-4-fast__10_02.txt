4.5

**Assessment:**

**Vocabulary Mandate:**
- The LLM answer strictly uses the mandated role names ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") and "KYC Review" (not "Customer Due Diligence"). It never uses forbidden alternatives.
- The mandated terms are used consistently, but not always applied to the right steps (e.g., in the last "Notify Regulatory Liaison" row).

**Accuracy & Structure:**
- The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" role, which is present in the Ground Truth and crucial for correct RACI assignmentâ€”especially for the Accountable ("A") designation.
- "Accountable" is at times assigned to the same role as "Responsible" (e.g., Transaction Analyst for "Receive and log..." and "Screen..."), whereas Ground Truth separates "A" to Operations Manager or Regulatory Liaison as appropriate.
- Consultation (C) and Information (I) designations are almost entirely missing (except "Notify Regulatory Liaison" task, which appears artificially created and inaccurate per the informal description).
- The "Release the payment" task wrongly assigns both "R" and "A" to Transaction Analyst, rather than dividing it as per the ground truth.

**Coverage:**
- Task breakdown is mostly correct, though some activities are unnecessarily split (e.g., sending a notification) or clumsily labeled, and the SWIFT messaging is handled as a separate activity (which aligns with source, but the R/A assignments are off).
- The "Archive Record" step is not handled ideally. "Notify Regulatory Liaison" is not a clear task from the source, but rather a notification step when the case file is archived.

**Formatting:**
- Markdown table used; legend is missing.
- Tasks/activities sometimes use paraphrased labels ("Receive and log customer's transfer instruction") rather than the succinct, standardized ones seen in the model ground truth ("Receive Payment Instruction", "Screen Against Sanctions List").

**Other Issues:**
- Not all stakeholders/tasks are matched exactly to the ground truth. "Operations Manager" is absent, so major aspects of the RACI map are not attributed properly.
- Lacks explicit mapping for "Consulted" and "Informed" on non-obvious steps.
- The last row ("Notify Regulatory Liaison") is not cleanly derived from the description.

**Conclusion:**
While the answer demonstrates understanding of the process and adheres to vocabulary restriction, fundamental RACI designations and stakeholder inclusion is incomplete, with errors in role accountability and missing roles. Several smaller errors in activity naming and assignment further justify a significant deduction.

**Hence: 4.5/10.**
