3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 4.0/10)**: The ground truth identifies exactly two decision points: the risk-based skip condition after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check and the TriVote gate. The LLM incorrectly introduces a third, redundant "decision point" for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself, which is merely a step producing an outcome, not a gate or branch. The description of the skip rule is mostly accurate but split unnecessarily, violating the "one sentence each" requirement by fragmenting it. The TriVote summary is close but less precise than the ground truth (e.g., "any two approvals... suffice to pass" vs. "at least two... record 'Approve'"), and the overall structure overcomplicates a simple process with only two true branches/gates. This demonstrates misunderstanding of the process flow.

**Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 3.0/10)**: The ground truth lists nine distinct documents in strict first-appearance order, treating the three scorecards as separate items and distinguishing "Offer Sheet 77" from "Signed Offer Sheet 77." The LLM undercounts (only six items), groups the scorecards into one entry (major deviation, as they are enumerated separately in the process), omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a standalone item (merely mentioning it descriptively), and adds an irrelevant conditional note to "Deck Memo" (which appears in sequence regardless of skipping). The order for "ID Matrix Declaration" is also imprecise, as it follows the unsigned Offer Sheet without accounting for the signing step. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions), but omissions and grouping errors make this substantially incomplete and non-compliant.

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average (a: 50%, b: 50%) with strict deduction for all discrepanciesâ€”small errors like grouping and imprecise phrasing compound to indicate poor fidelity to the process description. No credit for extras or vagueness; the response fails to mirror the ground truth's conciseness and accuracy.
