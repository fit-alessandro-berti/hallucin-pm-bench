The LLM answer is semantically and structurally identical to the ground truth answer. It correctly identifies and lists all three parallel blocks from Process B only, with tasks separated by commas in numbered lines, adhering precisely to the prompt instructions. Minor potential whitespace differences (e.g., trailing spaces in ground truth) do not constitute errors in content or format, as the output matches the required structure exactly.
