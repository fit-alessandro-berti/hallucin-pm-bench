**9.2**

The LLM answer is functionally identical and fully compliant with the task (adds only a boundary timer and sequence flow to the existing unused `Activity_AMReview`, using correct BPMN 2.0 syntax for an interrupting PT48H timer without new activities), but deducts for non-matching IDs (`Boundary_CreateAccountSLA` vs `Boundary_LateCreate`; `Flow_SLA_To_AMReview` vs `Flow_LateEscalation`), slightly different name (`48h SLA breach` vs `48h breach`), absence of ground truth comments (❶/❷), and justification rewording (lacks "boundary timer", "routing the timeout", "**bold** emphasis", "pre-existing ... task", and explicit "without introducing any new activities").
