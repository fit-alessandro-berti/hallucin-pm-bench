**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Verdict ("Non-compliant")**: Matches ground truth (+1.0 base).
- **Rule 1**: Major error. LLM incorrectly claims violation (confused rambling about `Expedite_Flag` order and "immediate predecessors," misinterpreting the rule). Ground truth: satisfied. (-2.0).
- **Rule 2**: Correctly identifies violation (`Risk_Assessment` after `Ship_Goods`). (+1.0).
- **Rule 3**: Major error. LLM wrongly claims compliance ("within two activities," ignoring distance calculation: from event 6, next two are 7/8; event 10 is distance 4). Ground truth: violated. (-2.0).
- **Rule 4**: Correctly identifies compliance (Intern not directly after CFO). (+0.5).
- **Rule 5**: Correctly identifies compliance (ends with `Archive_Record`). (+0.5).
- **Format/Structure**: Mostly numbered justifications matching expected style, but rambling/confusion in Rule 1 justification deducts clarity (-0.5). Misses explicit summary of violated rules (2 & 3) for overall non-compliance.
- **Overall**: Correct high-level conclusion but 2/5 rules wrong (one fabricated violation, one missed key violation); significant content differences justify low score under "utmost strictness" (total adjusted: 4.0).
