8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") due to the Rule 3 violation and accurately assesses Rules 2, 3, and 4 as satisfied, violated, and satisfied, respectively, matching the ground truth. The reasoning on the trace sequence and key violation (NA before RA) is sound and concise. However, it deducts points for incorrectly labeling Rule 1 as "partially satisfied" (due to conflating it with Rule 3's issue), whereas the ground truth deems Rule 1 fully satisfied (QE precedes RA, with no direct violation from NA's placement). This is a small but notable error in rule-specific assessment, and the format is less structured (narrative vs. table) without impacting correctness much. Under strict evaluation, this warrants a moderate deduction from a perfect score.
