1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Role structure mismatch**: Includes only three columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting the Operations Manager column present in the ground truth, which is essential for distributing accountability (A) across roles. This alone indicates incomplete mapping of responsibilities.

- **Task count and mapping errors**: Expands to 8 tasks (adding an unsubstantiated split for notification as task 8), while the ground truth maintains 6 tasks faithfully derived from the source text without additions or splits. Task 7 (Archive case file) and especially task 8 (Notify compliance officer) introduce omissions in integration, failing to cover "every task" as prompted without substitutions.

- **Vocabulary violations**: Uses "compliance officer" in task 8 description, directly contravening the strict mandate to use "Regulatory Liaison" exclusively. Task wording also diverges (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"), introducing informal phrasing not aligned with mandated precision.

- **RACI assignments inaccurate**: Fails to replicate the distributed roles in the ground truth (e.g., for KYC Review: LLM assigns R,A solely to Regulatory Liaison; ground truth assigns R to Regulatory Liaison, A to Operations Manager, C to Transaction Analyst, I to IT Support). LLM over-relies on combined R,A in single roles with no C assignments anywhere, ignoring the full RACI spectrum and source text implications (e.g., no consultation or information flows for IT Support in screening or release). Task 8 entry is malformed ("**R, A** (Responsible), **I** (Regulatory Liaison)"), misassigning responsibility for notification to IT Support.

- **Formatting and completeness issues**: Lacks the ground truth's legend integration within the answer, bolding for "KYC Review", and precise table header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"). No notes or legend in the core table output to clarify, and the inclusion of extraneous "Key Definitions" and "Notes" in the provided LLM response context suggests improper structure, but even the table itself is incomplete.

- **Overall fidelity**: Does not "map every step from the source text to the mandated terminology without omissions or substitutions," as required. Small errors (e.g., unbolded KYC Review, inconsistent capitalization in tasks) compound to show non-adherence, but the structural and assignment differences are disqualifying.

This results in near-total lack of alignment, justifying the lowest score.
