- The LLM answer is a plausible attempt but suffers from several marked flaws:
  1. **Roles Error/Omission**: It omits "Operations Manager", who is present in the ground truth and essential for correct accountability assignment.
  2. **Mandated Vocabulary Violation**: While it uses "Transaction Analyst" and "Regulatory Liaison" correctly, it allows "compliance officer" in table row labels and narrative, which is not permitted per prompt instructions.
  3. **Task Labeling Inaccuracy**: Some steps still use informal or original process terms and not the mandated terminology, such as "KYC Review" (the ground truth gets this exactly for step 3). Also, "Notify compliance officer" is presented, when the mandated term is “Regulatory Liaison”.
  4. **Responsibilities/Accountabilities Incorrect**: The "Responsible" and "Accountable" columns are often combined (e.g., **R, A** together for many steps), where the ground truth separates them (e.g., Regulatory Liaison is accountable for sanctions checks, not Transaction Analyst).
  5. **Split Tasks**: The answer splits and adds steps unfaithful to the provided process (e.g., creating a separate "Notify compliance officer" task with unclear mapping), which diverges from both prompt and ground truth.
  6. **Process Step Mapping**: The answer fails to combine or reorganize activity lines to match the ground truth's grouped (and properly renamed) tasks.

- Overall, these errors show lack of strict vocabulary use, missing roles, confused or inaccurate assignment of RACI roles, and added steps not supported by the instructions. These cumulatively amount to significant non-alignment, hence a low score.
