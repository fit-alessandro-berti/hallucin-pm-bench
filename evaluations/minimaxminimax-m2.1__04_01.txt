7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correct overall verdict ("Non-compliant"). Accurately identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with correct event citations and logical explanations. Matches ground truth on the violating rules' substance.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions per strictness directive)**:
  - **Incompleteness (-1.5 points)**: Fails to systematically evaluate *all 5 rules* as in ground truth (e.g., no mention of Rules 1, 4, or 5 being satisfied, despite their relevance for a full "process-audit"). Ground truth provides exhaustive coverage, confirming compliance where applicable, which is expected for a "senior process-audit bot."
  - **Factual error in distance calculation (-1.0 point)**: States "distance of 4 (10 - 6 = 4)" for Rule 3, contradicting ground truth's "distance = 3" (likely position difference -1 or events between). This misinterprets the metric "(distance ≤ 2)", a small but quantifiable error warranting significant loss.
  - **Structural/minor differences (-0.5 points cumulative)**: Justification only numbers violations (1-2) vs. ground truth's per-rule numbering (1-5). Lacks ground truth's explicit overall summary ("Because at least one rule is violated...") and detailed confirmations (e.g., Rule 4's "event 4 (System) lies in between").
- **Overall**: 75% alignment—core decision and violations perfect, but incompleteness and error prevent higher score under "utmost strictness" and "significant loss for small errors."
