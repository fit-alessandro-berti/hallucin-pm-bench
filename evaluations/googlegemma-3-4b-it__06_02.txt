The LLM answer correctly identifies all three concurrent task sets from Process B with exact task names and no extraneous tasks or references to other processes. However, it includes an unrequested introductory sentence, violating the prompt's directive to return the answer strictly as numbered lines. Additionally, it lacks spaces after commas in the task lists (e.g., "Generate_CAD_Drawing,Confirm_Materials_Availability" vs. ground truth's "Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability"), which is a minor but noticeable formatting inconsistency under strict evaluation criteria. These deviations warrant a deduction despite the core content matching perfectly.
