9.5

The LLM answer is almost fully accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. It correctly states that the absence of event data and timestamps in Artefact A makes it impossible to compute the requested metrics. The answer correctly avoids guessing, does not reference outside knowledge, and explains specifically that without start and complete times, no calculation can be performed.

Minor deduction: While precise, the LLM answer could be slightly improved in conciseness and explicit reference that resulting metrics (average, standard deviation, confidence interval) are fundamentally uncomputableâ€”not just that one "cannot determine the duration." The ground truth answer briefly adds that "neither the average... nor its dispersion or confidence interval can be calculated" and clarifies that raw log entries are required, which is a bit more explicit and complete.

Therefore, due to these minor nuances, the answer receives a 9.5.
