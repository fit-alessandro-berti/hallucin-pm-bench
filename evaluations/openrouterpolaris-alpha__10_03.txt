3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly used the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified in the first four rows, with no synonyms or leaks from disallowed vocabulary. The table is in Markdown format, covers all roles, and uses RACI designations (including combined "R,A" in cells). No renaming of the mandated activities.
- **Major Flaws (significant deductions)**:
  - **Added activities (violation of "do not add activities")**: The LLM introduced 5 extra rows ("Escalation for Compliance Officer approval", "Compliance Officer approval", "Scheduling the payment", "Releasing the funds", "Notifying the originating analyst after release") not present in the ground truth. This expands the matrix beyond the described process, merging/splitting elements like approval and release in ways that do not match. Ground truth consolidates into 6 rows (4 mandated + "Compliance Officer Approval" + "Release Funds"), treating escalation/scheduling/notifying as implicit rather than separate.
  - **Incorrect RACI assignments (multiple per row, strict loss)**: 
    - Intake Vetting: Front-Office Analyst (R vs. **R, A**); Compliance Officer (I vs. –).
    - KYC Review: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. –); Compliance Analyst (R vs. **R, A**).
    - AML Screening: Same as KYC Review (I vs. – for Front-Office; R vs. **R, A** for Compliance Analyst).
    - Risk Scoring: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. C); Compliance Officer (C vs. **A**).
    - Extra rows have no ground truth equivalent, but internal inconsistencies (e.g., "Notifying" assigns R to Front-Office Analyst, but narrative indicates Treasury Ops performs notification; duplicated R,A for Treasury Ops in "Scheduling" and "Releasing").
    - Overall, ~70% of cells differ from ground truth, including over-use of "I" where ground truth uses "–" (no involvement).
  - **Formatting errors**: No bolding (** **) for activity names or R,A cells as in ground truth. Headers and structure are close but lack exact replication (e.g., ground truth uses precise spacing and dashes).
  - **Scope mismatch**: Covers "every activity" too expansively, ignoring implicit instruction to align with ground truth's consolidated view of the narrative (e.g., no separate escalation or notification rows).
- **Strictness applied**: Each added row deducts ~1 point; each mismatched cell in shared rows deducts 0.5; formatting/scope issues deduct 1.5 total. Starting from 10, results in 3.5—acknowledges vocabulary compliance but penalizes heavily for additions, inaccuracies, and deviations.
