The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in structure, content, and format. All the parallel task sets were correctly identified, with no errors or omissions, and the answer strictly follows the instructions (only enumerating the three parallel blocks as numbered lines, tasks separated by commas, and not referencing any tasks from other processes or sequential steps). There are no differences between the answers.
