The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a strong, accurate justification that closely aligns with the ground truth by citing the key counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11). It demonstrates the violation of "always follows" with precise timestamps and case-IDs in a single paragraph. Minor deductions for slightly less emphasis on C005 "never containing" Receive_Order (instead implying it via "no preceding" and "begins with," which is true but not as explicit) and unnecessary inclusion of line 12 (Cancel_Order, irrelevant to the claim), reflecting small phrasing differences under strict evaluation.
