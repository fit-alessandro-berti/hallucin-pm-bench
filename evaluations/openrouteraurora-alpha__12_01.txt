9.8

The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and strictly data-driven, matching the ground truth in verdict ("No" vs. "**inaccurate**"), case-by-case analysis, key observations (reversal in 1001/1003, absence in 1002), and disproof of "always" and "immediately before." Minor deductions for stylistic differences: lacks explicit line citations (e.g., "lines 3-4"), uses "not supported" instead of "false," omits "Short verdict" header, and adds arrow formatting/Quality_Check detail (accurate but not in ground truth). No factual errors or guesses.
