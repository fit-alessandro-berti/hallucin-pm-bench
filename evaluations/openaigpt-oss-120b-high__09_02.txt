The LLM answer is concise, directly addresses the prompt's requirement for a one-sentence explanation, and correctly identifies the lack of timestamps as the key issue preventing calculationâ€”aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning. However, it loses a full point for slightly less precision: it does not explicitly reference the presence of "only event counts" or the absence of "start-to-completion intervals," making the explanation marginally less comprehensive under strict evaluation.
