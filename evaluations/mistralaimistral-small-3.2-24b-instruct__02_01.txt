8.0

The LLM answer is correct for Q1-Q4, matching the ground truth exactly. However, Q5 contains a significant error: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77) and lists four items instead of three, omitting the fact that only Validate_Order, Pack_Items, and Ship_Order never start a case. This misrepresentation of the activities, despite the unsorted list allowance, warrants a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria, reducing the score from a potential perfect 10.0 by 2.0 points.
