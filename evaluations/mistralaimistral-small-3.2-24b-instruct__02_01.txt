8.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

For Q5, the LLM incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as a non-starting activity, whereas in the fragment it does start case C-77. This is a significant, though not catastrophic error: three out of four items in the Q5 list match the correct answer, but one is extra and does not belong.

Given the requirement for strict evaluation and noting that Q5 is a core question with an error of logic, I deduct 2 full points (20%) for this mistake:

- Q1: correct (+)
- Q2: correct (+)
- Q3: correct (+)
- Q4: correct (+)
- Q5: one significant error (listing an activity that has appeared as a first event)

Final score: 8.0
