The LLM answer is nearly identical in content to the ground truth, accurately identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for formatting discrepancies: absence of bullet points (-) before each item (present in all ground truth entries), and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (e.g., extra spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" to match the first line's structure). These small but consistent omissions warrant a deduction despite perfect substantive accuracy.
