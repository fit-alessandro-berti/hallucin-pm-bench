The LLM answer is highly accurate, factually correct, and closely aligned with the ground truth in structure, verdict, and evidence across all cases. It correctly identifies the reversal of order in Cases 1001 and 1003, the absence in Case 1002, and the failure of "always" and "immediately before" conditions, with no guessing or errors. Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate"; timestamps vs. line references) and a marginally more verbose summary, which add detail without deviating from the data but diverge stylistically from the ground truth's conciseness.
