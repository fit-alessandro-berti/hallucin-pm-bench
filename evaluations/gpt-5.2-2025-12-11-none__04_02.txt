The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth in status (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) for all R1–R6, overall result, and justification accuracy/content (all ≤20 words, precise timestamps/reasons, no factual errors). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., R5 mentions Ship_Goods vs. both Ship/Pay; R2 "earlier" vs. ">2 days") are semantically equivalent and do not alter correctness. Format adheres strictly to prompt (bold status + short justification per rule + all-caps overall). No deductions required under utmost strictness.
