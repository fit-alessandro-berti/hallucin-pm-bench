**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect and precisely matches the ground truth content across all questions:
- Q1: Correctly identifies **3** distinct cases (C001, C002, C003); extra listing of cases is accurate and non-fabricated.
- Q2: Exact sequence `Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order` matches ground truth (minor escaping in ground truth is irrelevant).
- Q3: Exact list of distinct predecessors ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered, matching ground truth.

No errors, hallucinations, missing/extra fabricated elements, or deviations in factual precision. Formatting (bolding, intro, backticks) adds clarity without altering truth. Under strict line-by-line scoring, it aligns fully.
