### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Partial Credit, Major Omissions):** The LLM correctly identifies two of the three decision points from the ground truth: (1) eligibility check in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility (with appropriate branching implied via documents) and (2) the amount threshold (> €1,000) for the high-value branch. However, it completely misses the third key decision point: the final approval/rejection at Finance_Controller_PreApprove and/or Senior_Auditor_Review, which determines if the process proceeds to payment or ends without it. The LLM's claim of "no other decision points" and "linear flow after triage" directly contradicts this, introducing a false linearity not supported by the process constraints (which imply approval must "succeed" for payment). This is a significant structural error, as the prompt requires summarizing *every* decision point strictly from the process description. Deducting heavily for incompleteness (~3 points lost).

- **Required Documents (Partial Credit, Incomplete List):** The LLM lists some relevant documents tied to stages (RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail), staying within the defined artefacts without introducing extras (good adherence to "Do not introduce any activities or artefacts"). However, it fails to provide a *complete list of all required documents* as explicitly requested—instead fragmenting them per stage and omitting two critical ones: BankTransferAuthorization (required for Process_Refund_Payment) and RefundConfirmationPDF (for Issue_Confirmation_Letter). It also doesn't note AuditTrail's conditional use while including it in the catalogue, unlike the ground truth. This fragmentation and incompleteness (missing ~30% of documents) violates the prompt's demand for a holistic list, warranting substantial deduction (~2.5 points lost).

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness:** The response is concise and avoids hallucinations (e.g., no mention of the forbidden legacy activity), but it reinterprets the process too narrowly, ignoring implied decisions from constraints and under-delivering on the "all required documents" requirement. Structure is informal (e.g., "Okay, here’s a summary") and not tabular/list-like as in ground truth, but this is minor. With utmost strictness, even these partial matches don't fully compensate for the gaps—response covers ~60-70% of content accurately but misses core completeness.
