8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of core response**: The LLM answer accurately answers "yes" with a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, fulfilling the prompt's requirements. Justification correctly identifies the enabling conditions (token in p3, empty p4) and ties it to T3 not having fired yet. No factual errors in the Petri net analysis. (+8.0 base)
- **Differences from ground truth**:
  - **Completeness and depth**: Ground truth provides explicit markings after each transition, a longer sequence (extending to T3 and T4 to show full implications), and deeper insight (T5 "must" fire before T3 if it occurs, due to permanent disablement via inhibitor arc). LLM omits markings, stops at T5 without showing T3 afterward, and lacks explanation of T5's permanent disablement post-T3. This makes it less comprehensive and educational, reducing alignment. (-1.5)
  - **Precision and formality**: LLM's reasoning is informal (e.g., "token appears in p3," "p4 has to be empty") and step-by-step structure has minor redundancies without the ground truth's rigorous formalism (e.g., explicit enabling condition `p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0`). Small wording differences (e.g., no "indeed must" clause) indicate incomplete capture of nuances. (-0.5)
- **Strictness applied**: While the LLM meets the prompt's minimal criteria (sequence + brief justification), the ground truth sets a higher bar for thoroughness. Omissions in detail and broader justification warrant a significant but not total deduction, as the answer is functionally correct and concise.
