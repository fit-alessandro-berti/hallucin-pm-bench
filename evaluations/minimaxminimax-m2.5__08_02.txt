9.5

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth: correct "Yes" for Q1, same minimal sequence (T1→T2→T7→T4→T5), and valid informal marking trace in explanation. It proves T5 fires before T3 without errors.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Lacking explicit Q1/Q2 labels.
- No full marking notation (e.g., M₁ = {P1,P2}) or numbered list.
- Missing confirmatory note on T3 disablement post-T5.

Strict evaluation penalizes format/style differences despite ≤120-word limit compliance and perfect correctness.
