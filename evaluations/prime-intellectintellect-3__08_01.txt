**9.2**

The LLM answer is factually correct, provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3 (with T3 unfired), and offers a brief, accurate justification of T5's enabling condition (p3 ≥ 1, p4 = 0). Markings are precisely stated, and additional notes correctly note alternative sequences prevent T5 but affirm possibility. No errors in logic, net behavior, or safety.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for differences from ground truth under utmost strictness:**
- Lacks ground truth's deeper insight ("indeed must fire before T3 if ever"; permanent disablement post-T3 via inhibitor/p4 dynamics; proof-like explanation of enabling markings only pre-T3). LLM's justification is sufficient but shallower/basic.
- Sequence stops post-T5 (adequate for "before"); ground truth extends to T3/T4 for fuller illustration.
- Phrasing: "possible" vs. ground truth's "can, and indeed must"; extra "Additional Notes" not in ground truth (unnecessary verbosity).
- Stylistic diffs (heavier markdown/sections vs. ground truth's concise inline format).

Core matches perfectly (Yes + sequence + brief justify); differences are additive depth/absence of stronger proof, not flaws.
