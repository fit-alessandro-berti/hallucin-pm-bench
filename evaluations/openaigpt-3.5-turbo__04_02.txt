The LLM answer has critical errors in R1 (incorrectly claims missing Finance_Approval despite step 3), R2 (fails to identify post-change approval as last required, wrong status), and R3 (misreads dates/order, Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods, wrong status and justification). R5 justification incomplete (ignores timing of steps before late approval). Only R4/R6 fully accurate. Overall correct by chance, but per-rule accuracy ~50%, with factual/date errors warranting severe deduction under strict criteria.
