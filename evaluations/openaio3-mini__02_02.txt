The LLM answer is factually precise and fully matches the ground truth across all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the exact sequence for C002; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line, without any extras, omissions, or errors. Minor formatting differences (e.g., introductory text in Q3 or spaces) do not impact content accuracy.
