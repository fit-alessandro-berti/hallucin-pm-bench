### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) with no synonyms or leaks. Added activities use neutral names without violations.
- **Structure & format (partial, +0.5)**: Markdown table produced. Headers/roles match. Bold on activity names only (GT bolds R,A cells). Uses empty cells instead of explicit dashes (–) as specified in key points (-0.3 penalty). Activity column not padded for alignment (-0.2).
- **Activity coverage (near match, +0.7)**: Covers 6 activities matching GT (inferred from narrative). Minor rename "Fund Release" vs. "Release Funds" (-0.3 strict penalty for any renaming).
- **RACI assignments (major errors, -3.0+)**: 24 cells total; ~8 exact/near-matches (e.g., main R,A often correct: Intake FO R,A; KYC/AML CA R,A; Approval CO R,A; Release TO R,A). ~16 differences:
  | Activity | Key Errors (LLM vs. GT) |
  |----------|--------------------------|
  | Intake Vetting | CA: I vs. C; TO: ∅ vs. I |
  | KYC Review | FO: I vs. –; CO: ∅ vs. C; TO: ∅ vs. I |
  | AML Screening | FO: I vs. –; CO: ∅ vs. C; TO: ∅ vs. I |
  | Risk Scoring | FO: I vs. C; CA: R,A vs. R (extra A); CO: I vs. A |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | CA: I vs. C; TO: I vs. – |
  | Release Funds | CA: I vs. C; CO: I vs. C |
  - Systematic issues: No "C" (Consulted) used anywhere (GT has 10 C's); overuses "I" or ∅ where GT has C/–; misses accountability splits (e.g., Risk Scoring CO A).
- **Overall strictness**: High differences in ~67% of cells (significant loss); nuances like C vs. I/∅ are not interchangeable. No additions/merges, but misses process implications (e.g., consultations). Total reflects partial utility but clear non-equivalence.
