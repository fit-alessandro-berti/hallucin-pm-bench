9.5

The LLM answer provides exactly the two correct pairs, formatted almost perfectly. The pairs are alphabetized both within each pair and in the order the pairs are listed. Only a very minor formatting difference exists: the ground truth shows a bit more whitespace between task names (e.g., double or more spaces), but the LLM answer uses a single space. However, since the task says to return each pair in the format `Task_X  â€”  Task_Y`, this could be interpreted as (at minimum) two spaces on each side of the em dash, and the LLM uses only one. 

This is a **very minor error**, but per instructions, even small errors should result in a significant loss of points. Thus, 0.5 is deducted for not precisely following the formatting as shown in the ground truth.

**Score: 9.5**
