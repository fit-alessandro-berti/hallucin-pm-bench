The LLM answer is semantically identical and equally correct, capturing the core reason (no timestamps for temporal calculations) with precise reference to "artefacts" and "frequency counts" from the prompt. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; omission of explicit activity name in the sentence despite contextual clarity; less specific phrasing on "start-to-completion intervals" vs. general "temporal calculations"), per strict evaluation criteria.
