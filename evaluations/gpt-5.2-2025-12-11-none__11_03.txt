7.5

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of response):
- **Strengths (high alignment, + points)**: Perfect match on the three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment), exact quantification of SLA excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s), matching throughput/waiting times/cases from data. Joint criteria (SLA + waiting) correctly applied and implied in both.
- **Weaknesses (differences, - points, strict deduction)**: 
  - Headers/subject/from lines differ significantly (no "From", simpler subject, no date/"Loan-Origination").
  - Intro/analysis wording/structure differs (LLM has extra explanatory sentence; GT has invented "4805 cases" and bolded format).
  - Recommendations: **Major difference** – completely different actions/content (LLM: prioritization/fast-tracking based on data metrics/cases; GT: invented specifics like "pre-checks", "one analyst", "€25k heuristic"). Bullets prefixed vs. header + inline activities. No closing projection in LLM (GT invents 35% reduction).
  - Minor: Word styles (e.g., **bolding**, "s" spacing), length (~170 vs. ~160 words, close but not identical).
- **Overall**: Core data/identification flawless (8-9 range), but structural/wording/recs variances deduct heavily per strictness (net 7.5). No prompt violations in LLM (grounded, no inventions), unlike GT.
