### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies that the value cannot be derived/computed, directly addressing the system prompt's instruction to state this clearly when unsupported by data. It structures the response to match the user's numbered questions (1 and 2), providing a brief, data-driven explanation focused on the absence of timestamps/elapsed timesâ€”mirroring the ground truth's core reasoning about missing temporal data preventing any calculation. No fabrication of numbers occurs, and the response is concise and professional.
- **Weaknesses (minor deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Wording differences: LLM uses "cannot be derived" (exact match to system prompt) while ground truth uses "cannot be computed"; this is semantically identical but not verbatim. LLM's explanation defines cycle time as "time elapsed between start and end of that activity" (accurate but slightly narrower), omitting ground truth's explicit mention of "ordering information" and the risk of "fabricated" answers, which adds nuance to why it's impossible.
  - The LLM's phrasing "across all cases in the log" echoes the prompt but isn't as precisely integrated as ground truth's direct rephrasing of the query. These are small phrasing/omission gaps, not factual errors, but per strict criteria, they warrant a 0.8-point deduction from a perfect 10.0 to reflect incomplete verbatim fidelity and depth in reasoning.
