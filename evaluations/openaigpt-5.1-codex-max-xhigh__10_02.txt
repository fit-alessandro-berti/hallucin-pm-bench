**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Roles/Columns (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: LLM uses 3 columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support). Ground truth uses 4 (adds Operations Manager). Missing column is a critical omission; no invention or mapping to match GT.
- **Tasks/Rows (major deduction: -2.5 points)**: LLM has 8 rows with extra tasks (e.g., "Ensure SWIFT message is sent", "Notify Regulatory Liaison") and verbose phrasing not matching GT (e.g., "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Conduct KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"). GT has exactly 6 concise rows; extras/omissions/mismatches = failure to map precisely.
- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: Completely divergent across all rows. E.g., Receive: LLM (TA: R/A) vs. GT (TA: **R**, Ops Mgr: **A**, etc.). No row matches. LLM combines "R/A" in cells (non-standard vs. GT's separate bolded singles).
- **Formatting & Details (minor but strict deductions: -0.5 points each, total -1.0)**: No bolding on R/A/C/I (GT uses **bold**). No header like "Task / Activity (mandated wording)". No legend. Table header phrasing differs. Markdown valid but not identical.
- **Vocabulary (partial credit +1.0 base)**: Correctly uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”. No violations here.
- **Overall Coverage**: LLM covers source text more completely (includes SWIFT/notify), but deviates heavily from GT structure/content. Strictness demands near-exact match; partial adherence yields low score.

Total structural/assignment fidelity ~20%, hence 2.0.
