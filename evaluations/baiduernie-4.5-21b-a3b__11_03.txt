3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially captures the memo structure (e.g., To/From/Subject, ~180 words) and identifies two of the three correct worst-performing activities (Risk Review and Legal Approval) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times. However, it fails critically in several areas, warranting a low score under strict criteria:

- **Incorrect Third Activity**: Selects Customer Acceptance (no SLA breach: 180s < 300s target; low wait: 15s), ignoring Credit Assessment (breach +60s, high wait 200s), which jointly qualifies as the third-worst per data. This is a major factual error.

- **Quantification Errors**: 
  - Risk Review: Falsely states throughput as 900s (actual 600s, breach +300s vs. 300s SLA); waiting comparison invents "SLA of 300s" (no waiting SLA exists).
  - Legal Approval: Breach +300s correct, but waiting "vs. SLA of 600s" is invented.
  - Customer Acceptance: Invents 420s throughput (actual 180s, no breach) and "SLA of 15s" for wait.
  These violate "ground every sentence in the data" and "no metrics not provided."

- **Recommendations**: Not data-driven or grounded (e.g., invents "30% reduction," "chatbot for rote tasks," "€25k" absent from data; ground truth ties to data like case volumes implicitly). Not "bullet points only"—embedded in numbered lists. Lacks concreteness tied to table metrics (e.g., cases or times).

- **Other Violations**: Adds extraneous content (e.g., closing on other activities, signature); mentions non-table elements (e.g., "process orchestration," "arbitration tasks"). Exceeds "return only the memo text." No mention of total cases (~1,200 start, aligning with ground truth's 4,805? Wait, table sums cases ~1,200-455, but neither uses exactly).

The ground truth correctly prioritizes Legal (+300s/600s wait), Risk (+300s/480s wait), Credit (+60s/200s wait); uses pure bullets for actions; projects data-based impact. LLM's errors compound to show poor fidelity, justifying severe deduction from 10.0.
