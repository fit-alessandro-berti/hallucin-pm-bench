6.5

**Justification:**

### a) Decision Points

1. **Risk-Level Branch (Step 4)**
   - The LLM gives: "If risk is Low/Medium AND loan request ≤ €250,000, skip the Manual-Underwriting-Review step"
   - The ground truth: "if the risk rating is Low or Medium *and* the requested amount is ≤ €250 000, the process bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise it proceeds to that review."
   - **Assessment:** The LLM is accurate, concisely capturing the condition and outcome.

2. **TriVote Decision Gate (Step 6)**
   - The LLM gives: "Requires any 2 approvals out of 3 designated officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) to proceed"
   - The ground truth: "the loan may advance only when at least two of the three approvers ... record 'Approve.'"
   - **Assessment:** This is acceptably accurate and matches the process.

**Small errors/losses:**
- The LLM does not explicitly mention that approval cannot proceed if fewer than two approve, but this is strongly implied. The names of roles are correct and the roles are listed.

### b) Documents

1. The LLM lists:
   1. Form 14B
   2. Scorecard–Cyan
   3. Scorecard–Magenta
   4. Scorecard–Yellow
   5. Deck Memo
   6. Offer Sheet 77
   7. ID Matrix Declaration
   8. Loan Dossier 2025

2. **Ground truth includes all of the above** ***plus*** "Signed Offer Sheet 77" after "Offer Sheet 77" and before "ID Matrix Declaration."

**Critical error:**
- The LLM **misses 'Signed Offer Sheet 77'** as a distinct required document in its first appearance, which is explicitly listed in the process and the ground truth. This is a significant omission.

**Other notes:**
- The LLM does not hallucinate any documents or process elements, and does maintain the correct order for all listed items.

---

### Strict grading rationale

- Because "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is omitted (an explicit requirement per process and ground truth), this is a MAJOR factual miss, justifying a loss of at least 2 points.
- Minor loss for not fully restating the negative outcome on approval gate (not explicitly saying "does not proceed if two do not approve"), but reasonably concise.
- Otherwise structurally sound, no hallucinations.

**Hence, 6.5 is an appropriate strict score given the significant document omission and requirement for absolute accuracy.**
