The LLM answer is numerically exact for questions 1-2 (perfect match to ground truth: 1 occurrence, 2.08% of events, 8.33% of cases), earning full points there. For question 3, the response is concise (under 100 words) and addresses over-generalization (iii) and low-support implications for reliability/instability (ii partially, via misinterpretation and accuracy effects). However, it fails to explicitly mention the single-occurrence issue (i)—referring generically to "low-support" and "small sample" without tying to the one event's vulnerability to noise or specific risks (e.g., skewed averages, wide intervals)—resulting in a vaguer, less precise explanation. Strict deduction for this shortfall in depth and directness reduces the overall score.
