The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified em-dash format. However, it introduces extraneous bullet points ("- ") on each line, which deviate from the instructed "one pair per line" output without any list markers. Additionally, the spacing in the second pair lacks the alignment padding present in the ground truth (fewer spaces after "Procure_Materials" to align the dashes). These formatting discrepancies, while minor, warrant a deduction under the strict evaluation criteria emphasizing closeness to the ground truth and penalizing even small errors. The rationale confirms no content errors, supporting a high but not perfect score.
