8.0

The LLM answer provides both correct pairs ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines") in the required format and correct alphabetical ordering within each pair. However, it loses significant points for not respecting the prompt's formatting requirement of one pair per line with consistent pair formatting: specifically, the pairs are presented as bulleted list items rather than the explicitly required text format:  
`Task_X  —  Task_Y`  

Additionally, the answer did not use monospace formatting, and the spacing between the tasks within the second pair does not match the ground truth's precise alignment.

Due to these formatting discrepancies—even though the substance is correct—strictness in grading must deduct points, resulting in a score of 8.0.
