The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Addition of unauthorized activities**: The LLM added "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst" (two extra rows), directly violating the prompt's instruction to "do not... add activities." The ground truth includes only six specific activities, making this a major structural error.
- **Mismatched RACI assignments**: Out of the 24 cells (6 activities × 4 roles) in the shared activities, 11 have incorrect assignments (e.g., Intake Vetting: Compliance Analyst is "I" instead of "C"; KYC Review: Front-Office Analyst is "C" instead of "–", Compliance Officer is "I" instead of "C"; similar patterns in AML Screening, Risk Scoring [with three errors: Front-Office "I" vs. "C", Compliance Analyst "R, A" vs. "R", Officer "C" vs. "A"], Compliance Officer Approval [Treasury Ops "I" vs. "–"], and Release Funds [Compliance Analyst "I" vs. "C", Officer "I" vs. "C"]).
- **Incomplete fidelity to process narrative mapping**: Assignments do not accurately reflect the described responsibilities (e.g., Risk Scoring incorrectly consolidates "R, A" under Compliance Analyst instead of splitting "R" to Analyst and "A" to Officer for escalation cases).
- **Minor formatting issues**: Use of empty cells instead of "–" for no involvement, and lack of bolding on "R, A" cells, though these are secondary to content errors.

While the LLM correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms without synonyms and formats as a Markdown table with all roles, these positives are outweighed by the pervasive inaccuracies and additions.
