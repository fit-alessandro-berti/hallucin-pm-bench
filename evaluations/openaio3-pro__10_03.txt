5.0

- **Vocabulary**: The LLM answer correctly uses only the authorized activity terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) and does not leak synonyms. This is accurate and fulfills the strict vocabulary policy.
- **Activities**: The LLM introduces two extra activities ("Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst") not listed in the process narrative or ground truth. This is a major deviation.
- **Roles & Involvement**:
    - "Responsible" and "Accountable" are combined as "R, A" in most cases, which matches the ground truth structure, though there are discrepancies in who is assigned these.
    - For "Intake Vetting", the LLM gives “I” (Informed) to Compliance Officer (should be “–”).
    - For "KYC Review", sets the Front-Office Analyst as "C" (should be “–”), and gives "I" to roles that should be "C" or “–”, according to the ground truth.
    - "Risk Scoring": Should be "C" for Front-Office Analyst, "R" for Compliance Analyst, "A" for Compliance Officer, "I" for Treasury Ops — LLM instead assigns "R, A" to Compliance Analyst only; Compliance Officer gets "C" instead of "A".
    - "Compliance Officer Approval": Treasury Ops is marked as "I" (should be “–”).
    - "Release Funds": Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer should be "C", but LLM assigns "I" for both, and the Front-Office Analyst is "I" (acceptable since not involved).
- **Format**: Uses Markdown as required.
- **No merging or renaming**: All activities are listed individually, but the unwanted extra activities ("Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst") violate the instruction to not add activities.
- **Dash for uninvolved**: The LLM leaves blanks rather than using "–" for no involvement, which is a required convention per the key points.

**Summary of the main errors:**
- Adds two unauthorized activities.
- Incorrect RACI assignments for several activities and roles.
- Fails to use "–" for uninvolved roles.
- Minor issue: uses "I" instead of the dash in some places, per the ground truth.

**Conclusion:**  
These are significant process and output errors. Although the strict vocabulary and Markdown format are respected, the added activities and incorrect assignments, plus formatting omissions, warrant a substantial penalty. 

Thus, 5.0 is the most accurate score per the strict criteria required.
