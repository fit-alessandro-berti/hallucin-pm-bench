**9.2**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all three questions, correctly identifying 3 cases, "Pack_Items" as the predecessor for C456's Ship_Order, and "Cancel_Order" as the unique activity (verified by sorting events chronologically per case and counting occurrences). However, under utmost strictness:

- Minor deductions (-0.5 total): Formatting differences (e.g., "-" bullets vs. "*" and "**A1**/"**A2**/"**A3**" labels; bolding on values vs. plain text; no "\" escape on "Pack_Items").
- Further deduction (-0.3): Q1 omits explicit case list "(C123, C456, C789)" present in ground truth, despite question only asking "how many."
- Slight deduction (-0.0): Wordier labels restating questions vs. ground truth's ultra-concise style directly after labels (still aligns with "concise, bullet-point" instruction).

Near-perfect match in substance, sufficient style divergence for small point loss.
