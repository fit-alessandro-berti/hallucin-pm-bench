The LLM answer is accurate and complete for questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth precisely on counts and percentages (with correct calculations and rounding). For question 3, it adheres to the ≤100-word limit, mentions the single occurrence (i), cautions against over-generalization from the slice (iii), and implies instability through potential misrepresentation and bias (ii). However, it lacks the ground truth's specificity on statistical vulnerabilities (e.g., noise, skewing averages, confidence intervals), making the explanation more generic and less analytically rigorous—a minor but notable shortfall under strict evaluation, warranting a small deduction.
