3. The explanation notes the low occurrence (“only once in 12 cases”), cautions about representativeness (“may be underrepresented or overrepresented in the larger dataset”), warns of bias or incomplete conclusions, and alludes to unreliability—covering the statistical instability, single-observation issue, and risk of overgeneralisation required by the ground truth.
