**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision Points (major partial credit, -2.5 deduction)**: Identifies 2/3 key decision points accurately (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with correct terminology, conditions (≤2 points difference; <€15k vs ≥€15k), and flow summaries matching the process. However, **critically misses Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as the third explicit decision point (board votes approve/reject), which is a core branch in step 8. Lacks ground truth's precise positioning ("branch after Dual Underwriter Split"; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") and symbolic notation (⇒). This is a significant omission, not a minor rephrasing.
- **Required Documents (full credit, 0 deduction)**: Exact match to system prompt's list (6 items, verbatim phrasing like "(single pay-stub or tax slip)", "(CIS) template", "(≤ 3 months old)"). Ground truth's minor abbreviations (e.g., "≤ 3 months"; "pay-stub/tax slip") and extra note are not required by prompt; LLM adheres perfectly without introducing extras.
- **Overall Structure/Terminology (minor deduction, -0.5)**: Uses bolded headings and bullet/numbering cleanly; exact activity names (no standard terminology introduced). Slightly less detailed/formal than ground truth (no #### headers or flow emphasis), but prompt only requires summary/list.

Total: Strong on documents and 2/3 decisions, but missing MBA decision point warrants strict penalty (overall ~70% fidelity).
