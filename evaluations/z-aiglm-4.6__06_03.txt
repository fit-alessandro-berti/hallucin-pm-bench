The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two concurrent task sets in the exact order specified, focusing solely on Process B as required, with no extraneous information about other processes. The tasks listed match the ground truth precisely. However, deductions are applied for minor differences: (1) lack of descriptive labeling for each parallel block (e.g., "first parallel block"), (2) use of asterisks and inconsistent spacing/formatting instead of the ground truth's bolded headers, backticks, and â€– symbol for parallelism, and (3) absence of the clarifying sentence about no other parallel tasks (present in ground truth, adding completeness without violating the prompt). These small formatting and phrasing variances warrant a significant but not severe point loss under strict evaluation criteria.
