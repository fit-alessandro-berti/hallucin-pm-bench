**9.5**

The LLM answer is highly accurate, directly answers "No" to the binary question (equivalent to GT's "inaccurate"), provides a short evidence-based justification citing all relevant case IDs (1001–1003) and key activities/sequences, and correctly identifies counterexamples: reversed order in 1001 & 1003, absence in 1002 (disproving "always"). No factual errors or guesses.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for:
- Lacking GT's explicit line citations (e.g., "lines 3-4"), which provide precise data pointers despite not being strictly required.
- Slightly less structured phrasing (no bolded verdict or final summary sentence like "in none of the three cases"), making it marginally less polished vs. GT's format while still concise.
