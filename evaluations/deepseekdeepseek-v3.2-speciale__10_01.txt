3.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Assessment)
- **Vocabulary policy (STRICT - 20% weight)**: Perfect compliance. Uses exact “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance” with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. (+2.0)
- **Correctness of RACI allocations (50% weight)**: Major failures.
  - Responsible (R) correct for all rows (matches handlers: AM, CO, FC, IT). (+1.5 partial)
  - Accountable (A) incorrect in 3/6 rows (KYC Review: CO R/A vs. CO **R**/AM A; Payment Clearance: FC R/A vs. FC **R**/AM A; Record Update: IT R/A vs. IT **R**/AM C). AM A only "where appropriate" per notes, but LLM over-applies to all handlers. (-2.5)
  - No C/I assignments at all (all non-R/A cells blank vs. fully populated in ground truth: e.g., multiple C/I per row). Blanks = incomplete matrix; violates full RACI expectation. (-2.0)
  - Exactly one R per row: correct. (+0.5 partial)
- **Formatting & Structure (20% weight)**: Significant differences.
  - "R, A" (comma, no slash/bold) vs. "**R / A**" or single bolded letter. (-0.8)
  - Blanks vs. filled cells (all rows incomplete). (-1.0)
  - No bolding on key cells (**R**, **R / A**) or select activities (**KYC Review**, etc.). (-0.5)
  - Minor header/alignment diffs (e.g., spacing). (-0.2)
- **Unwarranted content (10% weight)**: None. Correct activities/roles, no extras. (+1.0)
- **Overall strictness penalty**: Small errors (formatting, commas) compound with major ones (incomplete/wrong A/C/I); ~70% divergence from ground truth cells/content. Total reflects partial R/vocab credit amid wholesale RACI failures.
