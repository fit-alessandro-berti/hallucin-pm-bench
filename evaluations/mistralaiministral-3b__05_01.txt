The LLM answer violates the core constraint by adding a new task ("Task_AutoEscalation"), which is explicitly forbidden. It also fails the SLA by routing to escalation and end event instead of ensuring flow to "Task_Triage" within 48 hours. The timer is placed incorrectly as an intermediate event rather than a boundary one, disrupting the process flow without bypassing issues like document requests. The XML is incomplete, alters existing flows improperly, and exceeds plain English format limits with code. No alignment with ground truth mechanics.
