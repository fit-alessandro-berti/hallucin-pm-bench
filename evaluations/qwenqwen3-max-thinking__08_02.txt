**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Major flaw (heavy deduction)**: Explicit **Answer to Question 1: No** is **incorrect** (ground truth: Yes). This is a critical, glaring error despite the contradictory explanation proving "Yes."
- **Partial credit**: Explanation correctly identifies the alternative path (T1→T2→T7→T4) and logic for P2/P5 enabling T5 pre-T3 (+1.5). Bonus sequence exactly matches ground truth and is minimal/correct (+1.5). Word limit respected.
- **Minor deductions**: Inconsistent self-contradiction (No vs. yes in text); lacks detailed markings/states from ground truth; poor formatting (no clear Q1/Q2 split, bonus mislabeled).
- **Strictness applied**: Wrong Q1 answer alone warrants <5.0; no full match despite reasoning accuracy.
