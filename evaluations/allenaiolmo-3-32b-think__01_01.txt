7.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision points (major partial match, -1.5 points)**: LLM correctly identifies 3 decision points matching the core logic (eligibility at Triage, approval at Finance, threshold branch), but framing/order differs from GT (e.g., LLM separates Finance approval and threshold explicitly; GT combines threshold as #2 after Finance and frames #3 as joint "final payment approval" at Finance/Auditor). Introduces "implicit decision point" phrasing and "automatically evaluate," slightly deviating from GT's exact activity-tied descriptions and table format. Outcomes similar but not verbatim (e.g., LLM "reject the claim" vs GT "rejected/returned"; no exact "Final payment approval" match).
- **Required documents (significant error, -1.0 points)**: Lists 6/7 correctly (perfect match on 1-6, including conditionals for AuditTrail), but **omits RefundConfirmationPDF** (explicitly in GT #7 as part of "complete list"). LLM's note calling it "output/not required input" is logical but directly contradicts GT inclusion, violating "all required documents" completeness.
- **Overall structure/content fidelity (minor deductions, -0.5 points)**: Extra "Notes" section adds unrequested explanation (helpful but extraneous); bullet/list format vs GT's table; no introduction of undefined activities/artefacts, but phrasing like "High-Value Threshold Check" borders on new naming. Adheres to prompt constraints (no legacy activity).
- **Strictness applied**: Perfect match = 10.0. Cumulative differences (omission, reframing, structure) deduct 3.0 total for non-identical output despite strong essence capture (~85% alignment). No criminal/policy violations.
