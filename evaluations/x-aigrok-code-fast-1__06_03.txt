The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two concurrent task sets in the exact order from Process B, with no extraneous information about other processes. It fully matches the core content of the ground truth. Minor deductions for lacking the descriptive headers (e.g., "Set 1 – first parallel block:"), the ‖ notation for parallelism (using "and" instead is less precise for BPMN context), backticks around task names, and the confirmatory closing sentence, which add clarity but are not strictly required by the prompt.
