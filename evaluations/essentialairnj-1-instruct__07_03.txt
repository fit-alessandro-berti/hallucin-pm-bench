4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **ADDED TASKS**: Correctly identified all 3 new tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), but **wrong format** on all ("id: name" instead of required "`id` followed by the `name` in parentheses", e.g., "Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)"). Strict deduction for format violation (-2.0 points).
- **REMOVED TASKS**: Completely missed the one verifiable removal (Task_ManualReview present in v1, absent in v2). Empty section is incorrect (-3.0 points).
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: Correctly listed Gateway_ReviewNeeded (exclusive → parallel), but missed Gateway_Payment (exclusiveGateway in v1 → parallelGateway in v2). Incomplete (-2.0 points).
- Headings verbatim and in order: correct (+1.0 partial).
- No extra commentary: correct.
- Total: Major omissions (2 changes missed) and format errors outweigh partial accuracy (4.0/10.0). Small errors (format) cause significant loss as instructed.
