6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) as the ground truth, based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies the excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) with supporting throughput and waiting metrics grounded in the table data. This core analytical content aligns well (≈80% match), justifying a mid-high baseline score.

However, under utmost strictness, several differences and errors deduct points significantly:
- **Format violations (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: The prompt specifies "bullet points *only* for the recommendations" and "return *only* the memo text." The LLM uses bullets for the activity list (e.g., "- **Risk Review** ..."), which is incorrect—ground truth uses bolding without bullets. Additionally, the LLM adds extraneous elements like "[Insert Date]", "Data source", and "Word count: ≈150", bloating the response beyond "only the memo text," unlike the clean ground truth header.
- **Structural differences (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: The LLM's full memorandum header and list-style activities deviate from the ground truth's concise intro sentence, bolded activity blocks, and integrated total cases mention (even if the ground truth's "4 805" appears calculated/invented, the LLM lacks any equivalent opener). Activity order is reversed for two items, creating a non-matching flow.
- **Recommendations (major deduction: -1.0 point)**: While both use bullets for one action per activity and tie to data (e.g., waiting time percentages in LLM are valid derivations like 480/600=80%), the content is entirely different and less specific than the ground truth. LLM's actions (e.g., "allocate dedicated personnel," "reengineer workflows," "cross-train staff") are generic and process-focused, missing the ground truth's concrete, innovative details (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"). The LLM omits the ground truth's concluding projection ("reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35%"), reducing impact.
- **Minor issues (small deduction: -0.5 point)**: Word count ≈150 is met but claimed explicitly (unneeded); phrasing like "exceeds Target_SLA by **300s**" is precise but stylistically less fluid than ground truth's " +300 s." No inventions in LLM (strong), but lack of ground truth's contextual flair (e.g., "Loan-Origination") makes it drier.

Overall, the LLM captures the prompt's essence effectively but fails on precision in format, recommendation specificity, and adherence to output constraints, resulting in a 35% deviation from the ground truth. A perfect score would require near-identical structure, phrasing, and actions.
