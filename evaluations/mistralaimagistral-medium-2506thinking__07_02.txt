7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), the removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway change (from exclusive to inclusive). Headings are used exactly as specified, and no incorrect changes are invented. Core summary aligns well with ground truth content.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Missing task IDs (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity`) in added/removed lists, reducing precision compared to ground truth.
  - Gateway description omits explicit XOR/OR notation and version references (v1/v2), making it less detailed.
  - Extraneous content (explanatory paragraph, Markdown block, LaTeX box) violates "strictly under the three requested headings" by adding unrequested formatting and analysis; this alone warrants a major penalty under utmost strictness.
  - Minor formatting differences (bullets vs. numbered lists, no bolding or final note) compound the lack of exact match.
- **Overall**: High accuracy on substance (8.5/10) but penalized heavily for extras, omissions, and non-strict adherence (-1.0 total), yielding 7.5. Even small deviations like missing IDs reflect significant loss as instructed.
