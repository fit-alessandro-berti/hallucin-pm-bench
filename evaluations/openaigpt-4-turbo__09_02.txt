The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and correctly identifies the impossibility due to absent timestamps/duration data, fully aligning with the ground truth's reasoning. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "not possible" vs. "impossible"; referencing the "frequency table" explicitly; less emphasis on "event counts" and "intervals absent") under utmost strictness.
