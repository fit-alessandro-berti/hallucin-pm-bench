6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (throughput excesses: +300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s), matching ground truth precisely. Memo format is executive-style with To/From/Subject. Quantifies excesses accurately using table data (Avg_Throughput_Time - Target_SLA).
- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **Bullet points violation**: Uses bullets for the activity descriptions ("- **Legal Approval**..."), but prompt specifies "**bullet points only for the recommendations**". Ground truth keeps activities inline/bolded in prose.
  - **Invented metrics**: Adds un-supplied percentages (50%, 100%, 25% for excesses; 30%, 20% projected reductions in recs), violating "ground every sentence in the data supplied; do NOT invent...metrics". Ground truth avoids this.
  - **Recommendations mismatch**: Completely different actions vs. ground truth (e.g., LLM: "triage system", "parallel processing"; ground truth: "rule-based pre-checks", "add one risk analyst", "straight-through heuristic for €25k"). LLM's are generic/not matching; both invent details, but divergence is total.
  - **Structural/content diffs**: No total cases mention (ground truth: "4 805 completed cases"). Different subject, From line, intro phrasing, closing (risks vs. 35% projection). Word count ~220 vs. ground truth ~140 (exceeds ≈150).
- **Strictness applied**: Bullet misuse and invented metrics alone warrant -2.0+ deduction; rec mismatch another -1.5. Core identification saves it from lower.
