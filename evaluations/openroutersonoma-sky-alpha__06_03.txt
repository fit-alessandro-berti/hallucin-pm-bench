The LLM answer is technically correct and lists precisely the two sets of concurrently executable tasks as specified in Process B, with no extraneous information. However, it omits brief contextual details present in the ground truth, such as explicitly labeling the set order by parallel block (e.g., "first parallel block"), denoting tasks with "â€–" between them, and specifying that "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." Although these omissions are relatively minor, strict grading demands a point deduction for adherence to structure, clarity, and completeness requested by the assessment criteria.
