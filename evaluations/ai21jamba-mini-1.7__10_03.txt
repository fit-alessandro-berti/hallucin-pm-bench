2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +1.0)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms exactly as specified (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) in the table headers and nowhere else. No disallowed synonyms (e.g., "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", "Sanctions Check", "risk rating") appear in the output. This adheres strictly to the policy.
  
- **Completeness of Activities (-4.0)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** described in the narrative, without renaming, merging, or adding. The narrative implies six distinct activities: the four mandated ones plus "Compliance Officer approval" (escalation for high-risk cases) and "release funds/schedule payment" (Treasury Ops execution and notification). The LLM only includes the four mandated activities, omitting the two critical ones present in the ground truth (Compliance Officer Approval and Release Funds). This is a major failure to cover the full process, resulting in an incomplete matrix.

- **Table Structure and Formatting (-2.0)**: The table is a valid Markdown but transposed (roles as rows, activities as columns) compared to the ground truth (activities as rows, roles as columns), which alters readability and direct comparability. Blanks are used for no involvement instead of dashes (–) as in the ground truth. No combined notations like **R, A** are used; all assignments are single (or blank), missing nuances where a role has multiple responsibilities (e.g., Compliance Analyst is R, A for KYC and AML in ground truth).

- **RACI Assignments Accuracy (-0.5)**: Even for the four shared activities, assignments are frequently incorrect or incomplete:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM has Front-Office Analyst as Responsible only (missing Accountable); omits Compliance Analyst (C), Treasury Ops (I); Compliance Officer blank (correct as –).
  - **KYC Review**: LLM has Compliance Analyst as Accountable only (missing Responsible); omits Compliance Officer (C), Treasury Ops (I); Front-Office blank (correct as –).
  - **AML Screening**: LLM has Front-Office as Informed (incorrect; ground truth –); Compliance Analyst as Responsible only (missing Accountable); omits Compliance Officer (C), Treasury Ops (I).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Mostly aligns (Front-Office C, Compliance Analyst R, Compliance Officer A), but incorrectly assigns Treasury Ops as Responsible (ground truth I).
  These mismatches (e.g., missing multiples, wrong roles like Front-Office in AML) indicate significant errors in interpreting the narrative's roles/responsibilities.

Overall, while vocabulary is perfect, the output is incomplete, structurally divergent, and inaccurate in ~70% of RACI cells for shared activities, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Small errors (e.g., blanks vs. –, transposition) compound the major ones (incompleteness, wrong assignments).
