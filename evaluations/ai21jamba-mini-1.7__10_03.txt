2.0

- The LLM answer violates the requirements in several critical ways:
  - **Matrix Structure:** The answer only covers the four core activities: Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, and Risk Scoring. It omits two required activities clearly present in the process: "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds."
  - **Roles as Columns:** In the LLM answer, activities are columns and roles are rows, whereas the ground truth has the correct layout of activities as rows and roles as columns.
  - **Incomplete Role Involvement:** Many relevant RACI assignments are missing. The LLM answer leaves multiple fields blank (rather than marking with “–”) and fails to indicate the correct involvement for various roles (e.g., Compliance Officer and Treasury Ops are almost entirely omitted from most activities).
  - **Markings/Assignments:** The answer does not use R, A, C, I or combined forms (“R, A”) consistently or correctly. For example, in “Intake Vetting,” the Front-Office Analyst is only “Responsible”, missing “Accountable”. Similar misassignments are found for all other activities.
  - **Strict Vocabulary Policy:** While the table heading does use all required names, the assignments and fields for Consulted, Informed, and Accountable are used sparingly and inconsistently.
  - **Tabular Format:** The table layout is not as required, making it less clear and directly mismatched against the ground truth.
  - **No Unauthorized Terms:** On the positive side, the LLM answer does avoid unauthorized synonyms.

Given these severe fidelity issues and incomplete mapping of the process as well as missing mandated activities and RACI details, the score cannot be above 2.0. The only reason it is not 1.0 is because the correct vocabulary is used and no synonyms appear. The answer is drastically incomplete and incorrect per instructions.
