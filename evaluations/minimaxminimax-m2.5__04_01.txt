The LLM answer correctly identifies the verdict ("Non-compliant") and precisely cites the two relevant violating rules (2 and 3) with accurate event positions and explanations matching the ground truth. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits verification of all rules (1, 4, and 5, which the ground truth explicitly confirms as satisfied with event citations), differing structure (no full 1-5 numbering aligned to rules, no "Justification" header, no summarizing conclusion), and minor formatting variances (e.g., en dash in "Non‑compliant"). These differences reduce perfection despite no factual errors in the violations reported.
