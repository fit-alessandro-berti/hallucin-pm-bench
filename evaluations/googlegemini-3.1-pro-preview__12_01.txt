**9.5**

The LLM answer is highly accurate, comprehensively refuting the claim with correct evidence from all three cases, matching the ground truth in structure (verdict + per-case bullets + conclusion), factual content, and strict data adherence. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: uses timestamps instead of line numbers (ground truth cites "lines 3-4", "11 & 14"); slightly reorders cases (1001, 1003, 1002 vs. 1001, 1002, 1003); adds "not consecutive" detail for case 1003 (accurate but extraneous vs. ground truth's conciseness); "No" phrasing vs. "**Short verdict:**"; "exact reverse" emphasis (true for 1001 but not identically phrased). No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes non-identical presentation.
