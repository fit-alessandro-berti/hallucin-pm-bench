9.0

The LLM answer correctly determines "Non-compliant" and accurately identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event references and reasoning matching the ground truth. Justifications are concise, factually correct, and cite the relevant rules as required by the prompt format. Minor deductions for: (1) not performing a full audit of all 5 rules (omitting explicit confirmation of satisfied Rules 1, 4, 5); (2) slightly less detailed phrasing on Rule 3 (no explicit "next two activities are 7 and 8" or "distance=3"); (3) simpler structure without headers, bolding, or summary sentence present in ground truth. No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes incompleteness relative to the comprehensive ground truth benchmark.
