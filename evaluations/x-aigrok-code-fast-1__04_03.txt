The LLM answer is semantically accurate and fully addresses the prompt's requirements by correctly identifying the overall non-compliance ("No"), evaluating each rule with precise justifications, and highlighting the exact violation in Rule 3. All factual content matches the ground truth, including rule assessments and reasoning (e.g., order of QE/RA, timing of NA before RA, and CC after prerequisites). Minor deductions only for structural differences: bullet-point format versus the ground truth's tabular layout, and lack of symbolic indicators (✔/❌) or explicit "overall trace is non-compliant" phrasing in the header, which slightly deviates from the gold standard's presentation despite identical substance.
