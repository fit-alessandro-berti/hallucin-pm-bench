The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the impossibility due to missing timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning. It loses a minor 0.5 points for slightly less detail (e.g., not explicitly noting "event counts" or "start-to-completion intervals"), but remains a strong match under strict evaluation.
