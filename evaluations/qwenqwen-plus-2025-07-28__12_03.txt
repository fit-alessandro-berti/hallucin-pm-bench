The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate by answering "No" and providing a precise justification focused on the two violating cases (C002 and C004), accurately citing sequences and timestamps to demonstrate interventions ("Pack_Items" and "Check_Fraud"), which directly refutes the "always" claim. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core reasoning and evidence. Minor deduction for not exhaustively covering all cases (e.g., omitting C001 and C003 where the sequence holds, as shown in the ground truth table), resulting in slightly less comprehensive structure, though no factual errors or omissions of key violations occur.
