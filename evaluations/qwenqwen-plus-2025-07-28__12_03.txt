The LLM answer provides a correct “No” assessment and cites both C002 and C004 as counterexamples, accurately describing the activity sequences relevant to the claim. This is the core of the ground truth.

However, it does not systematically address all cases, specifically omitting explicit mention of C001 and C003 where the claimed immediate sequence does occur. While the LLM does not make any incorrect claims, the omission of a comprehensive, case-by-case breakdown as done in the ground truth represents a significant, though not critical, loss of completeness and precision.

According to the instruction to be "utmost strict" and penalize even small errors, this lack of exhaustiveness and tabular clarity merits a loss of 2 points.
