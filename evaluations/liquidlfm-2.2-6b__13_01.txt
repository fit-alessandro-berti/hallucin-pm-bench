### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). Full points.
- **Question 2**: Exact match (5.56%, including correct calculation). Full points.
- **Question 3**: Exact match (only A1002). Full points.
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, sampling-related reasons that align closely with ground truth concepts (temporal bias via short time window; sampling bias via lack of randomness/diversity and generalizability issues, akin to small sample size and case-mix bias). No hallucinations or unjustified inferences. However, minor deductions for: (1) slight inaccuracy in time window description (log spans ~5 hours from 09:00 to 14:05, not precisely 4 hours); (2) reasons are valid but not as precisely quantified or exemplified as in ground truth (e.g., no mention of variance impact like Â±5.56 pp from small sample). These small deviations warrant a ~0.8 point loss under strict criteria.
