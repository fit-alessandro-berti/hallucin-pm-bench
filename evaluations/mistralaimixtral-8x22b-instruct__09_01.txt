9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Both correctly conclude the value cannot be derived/computed due to absent timestamps/durations. LLM precisely follows the system instruction ("cannot be derived"), structures response to match the two-part user query (1) and 2)), and accurately notes visibility of sequence/resources while emphasizing need for temporal data per activity occurrence. Core reasoning matches: no durations → no cycle time calculation.
- **Differences (point deductions, per strict criteria)**:
  - Phrasing in Q1: "cannot be derived" vs. GT's "cannot be computed from the information provided" (-0.3; not identical, lacks GT's specificity to "information provided").
  - Explanation details: LLM mentions "elapsed-time fields" (directly from context) and affirms "sequence ... visible" (correct), but omits GT's "ordering information" lack, "temporal value per event," and warning against "fabricated" answers (-0.3; misses emphatic anti-hallucination tone and exact field omissions).
  - Structure/emphasis: LLM separates 1)/2); GT uses bolded block quote + "Reasoning:" header (-0.1; format divergence).
  - Minor verbosity: LLM adds "for each occurrence of the activity" (accurate but extraneous vs. GT's conciseness) (-0.1).
- Overall: Extremely close substantively (95%+ match), but strict word-for-word/nuance differences warrant deduction from 10.0. No factual errors in LLM; outperforms on structure.
