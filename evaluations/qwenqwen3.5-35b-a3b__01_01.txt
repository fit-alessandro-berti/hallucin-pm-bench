**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies 3 decision points matching the ground truth count. High-value threshold (decision #2) closely aligns in location (after step 3/preapprove), criteria (> €1 000), and outcomes (proceeds vs. skip). Documents list is **identical** (all 7 artefacts, no extras/introductions), earning full marks there (~35% of response weight).
- **Weaknesses (major deductions for differences)**:
  - **Decision #1**: Describes criteria accurately but omits explicit branching/outcomes (*Eligible* → continue; *Not eligible* → rejected/returned), a core element in ground truth. Loss: -1.5.
  - **Decision #3**: Significant mismatch—incorrectly bundles *BankTransferAuthorization* into the AND criteria ("must be present"), conflating the constraint ("may begin only after approvals") with the separate execution condition ("once signed... present"). Frames as "readiness check" vs. ground truth's "final payment approval" with approve/reject logic at specific activities. Loss: -2.0.
  - **Overall structure/content**: No reject paths inferred consistently (unlike ground truth table). No conditional note on *AuditTrail*. Verbose additions ("gating conditions", Action/Criteria/Outcome sub-bullets) deviate from ground truth's concise table + list. No restatement of "no other documents/legacy". Loss: -0.5.
- **Scoring**: Starts at 10.0, deducts 4.0 total for differences (strict: even inferred details must match; logic error in #3 is substantive). 7.0 reflects good docs + 1 solid decision, but unfaithful summaries.
