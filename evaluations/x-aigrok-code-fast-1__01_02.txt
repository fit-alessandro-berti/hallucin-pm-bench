The LLM answer is semantically accurate and covers all required elements (identifying the three decision points correctly and listing all six documents), using exact activity names without introducing standard loan terminology. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs point deductions for: (1) minor phrasing differences in decision points (e.g., not specifying positional context like "after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"; adding interpretive details like "proceeds directly to Disburse Funds" and "only upon approval," which are not in the ground truth); (2) wording variances in three document descriptions (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"); (3) structural differences (bullets vs. numbered list); (4) extraneous content (introductory sentence, explanation of non-decision steps, and absence of the ground truth's closing note emphasizing no standard documents). These small but cumulative deviations prevent a perfect score.
