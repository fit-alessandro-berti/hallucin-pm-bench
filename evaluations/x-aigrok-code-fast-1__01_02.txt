8.0

The LLM answer is largely correct and closely matches the ground truth, but there are several small errors that merit a deduction of points:

**Strengths:**
- The LLM uses the correct activity names ("Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision", "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)") and accurately identifies them as decision points.
- The list of required documents matches the ground truth in both items and terminology.
- No standard loan terminology is introduced.

**Issues / Errors:**
- The LLM clusters the explanation of decision points together and does not enumerate them as clearly as in the ground truth. For example, it does not clarify that "Amount Threshold Decision" is only performed after "Neighbourhood Feedback Check," and omits the exact order of branching.
- The LLM adds explanatory content such as "Other steps (e.g., Quick KYC Verification...)" which is not requested, and should have omitted per the prompt (which asked for only decision points and required documents).
- It could cause minor confusion by listing "system auto-approves and proceeds directly to Disburse Funds" (the flow actually still lists "Disburse Funds" as step 9, but this is a minor issue).
- The "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" as written could be slightly misleading—the ground truth just says "Community Impact Statement (CIS)" (though this is very minor).
- For "Proof of Address," the ground truth says "(≤ 3 months)" and the LLM repeats "(≤ 3 months old)", a trivial difference.
- There are no significant omissions or incorrect additions, but the absence of very explicit step references and the inclusion of extra commentary mean it is not perfectly strict to the prompt.

**Conclusion:**  
These minor errors and lack of strictly requested formatting lead to a score of 8.0—very good, but not perfect under the criteria of utmost strictness.
