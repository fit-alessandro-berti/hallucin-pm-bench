8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" and precisely justifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with accurate citations to events, sequences, and rule requirements, matching the ground truth's violation details verbatim in substance (e.g., reversed order for Rule 2; distance exceeded via three intervening events 7-9 for Rule 3). Format aligns with the prompt ("Non-compliant" followed by numbered justification citing rules). However, deducting 1.5 points for incompleteness: omits explicit checks of Rules 1, 4, and 5 (all satisfied per ground truth), lacking the full systematic audit structure, detailed per-rule numbering (1-5), and concluding summary sentence—significant differences in thoroughness and content coverage under utmost strictness. No factual errors.
