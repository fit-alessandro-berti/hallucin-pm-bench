The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid counterexample from case C003 (lines 6 and 7), which directly refutes the claim by showing Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order. However, it is incomplete compared to the ground truth, as it omits the additional counterexample in case C005 (lines 11 and 12), where Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order in that case, further proving the "always follows" claim inaccurate. This omission of a key instance reduces the thoroughness of the justification, warranting a deduction despite the core logic being sound; under strict evaluation, missing half of the ground truth's explicit counterexamples results in a mid-range score.
