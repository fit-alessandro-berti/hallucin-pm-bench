The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can execute in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses one pair per line in the specified format. This matches the ground truth perfectly in content and structure.

The only differences are minor whitespace variations: the ground truth includes additional spaces in the second line ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines") for visual alignment of the em dashes in monospace font, while the LLM answer uses consistent spacing per the instructed format (`Task_X  —  Task_Y`, implying fixed gaps regardless of task name length). No code block or extra newlines are present in the LLM answer, matching the expected plain list output.

Under utmost strictness, this whitespace discrepancy constitutes a small formatting error, warranting a significant but limited deduction (1.0 point) from perfection. Substance is flawless.
