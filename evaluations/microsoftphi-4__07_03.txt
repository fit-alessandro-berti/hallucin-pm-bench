8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with precise content matching the ground truth (added/removed tasks and gateway types are identical and verifiable from the XML). However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.5 points total for multiple small formatting inconsistencies: extraneous bold markdown (** **) on all three headings (not verbatim); added backticks (` `) around every task ID and gateway ID (6 instances, absent in ground truth); minor misalignment in gateway descriptions (lacks spacing for visual alignment in the second entry); and inclusion of leading dashes (-) before headings (not matching ground truth's plain heading style). These are superficial but numerous, warranting the deduction despite perfect substantive accuracy.
