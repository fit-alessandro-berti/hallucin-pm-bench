6.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities with the longest waiting times, using the correct figures from the table:

- **Request_Documents**: Avg 36.5h, 95p 120.0h  
- **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg 12.2h, 95p 44.0h  
- **Assess_Liability**: Avg 7.8h, 95p 16.4h

It also stays within the word limit, mentions only the relevant activities, and does not reference service-time or throughput.

However, significant shortcomings versus the ground truth justify a notable point deduction:
- The memo states it ranks by "95th-percentile waiting time," but the ranking order is the same as by average waiting time. Though this doesn’t affect the selected activities, it’s a minor inaccuracy in memo phrasing.
- **Action recommendations**:
    - For **Request_Documents**, "Automate document requests via client portal" is reasonable but less targeted and less data-driven than the ground truth’s specific “automated reminders with escalation triggers”—missing empirical support or a mechanism for ensuring a ≥20% reduction.
    - For **Send_Closure_Letter**, "Pre-populate templates" is plausible but less impactful compared to the specified switch to "same-day e-signature letters" in the ground truth, and does not explicitly explain the expected percentage reduction.
    - For **Assess_Liability**, "Dedicate 1 additional claims assessor" is generic and resource-dependent; it’s less data-driven, not directly justified in terms of wait-time reduction, and more operational-cost focused, unlike the more targeted “rules-engine pre-classification” from the ground truth.
- The “target: 20% reduction to ≤XXh 95p” for each activity feels formulaic and is not supported by cited evidence or pilot results, unlike the detailed quantitative justification in the ground truth.
- There are unnecessary elements (headings, signature lines, etc.) that slightly detract from the “crisp executive memo” style.

**Summary:** The answer hits the basics but fails to match the specificity, data support, and sophistication of the ground truth, especially in the recommendations. Several small, cumulative errors justify a score of 6.5.
