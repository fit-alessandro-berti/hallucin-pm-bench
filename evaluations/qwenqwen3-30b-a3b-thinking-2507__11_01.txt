9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (9.5/10)**: Activities ranked correctly (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability) based on both avg and 95p waiting times, which align with the table and ground truth ordering. All quoted figures match verbatim (e.g., 36.5h/120.0h), including units ("h") from the table—ground truth omits units, a minor stylistic difference but no factual error.
- **No Unwarranted Content (10/10)**: Strictly limited to the three activities, waiting times only; no service times, throughput, or other activities mentioned. Word count (148) complies with ≤150 limit.
- **Action Relevance (8.5/10)**: Each action is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for queuing delays), and explicitly targets ≥20% reduction with calculated benchmarks (e.g., ≤96h). However, actions differ significantly from ground truth (e.g., LLM's portal automation vs. ground truth's reminders/escalation; no "pilot tests" or estimation phrasing), introducing distinct inventions despite both being data-driven in intent. This creates notable divergence, deducting points under strictness for differences.
- **Format and Fidelity to Ground Truth (9.0/10)**: Full memo structure (header, subject) fits the "crisp executive memo" prompt better than ground truth's snippet-like bullets, but ground truth's concise "#1–#3" phrasing and embedded note (omitting header) highlight format variance. No major errors, but small inconsistencies (e.g., "95p" vs. ground truth's "p95"; added word count note) warrant minor deduction.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: High fidelity to requirements (95% match in core elements), but action and phrasing differences prevent perfection; small variances (e.g., ranking basis explicitly stated as 95p, though prompt is ambiguous) reflect in targeted loss without overpenalizing valid interpretation.
