9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: The core answer (3) is correct, but the response includes extraneous details ("distinct cases (C001, C002, C003)") not requested or present in the ground truth ("**3**"). This adds unasked information, warranting a minor deduction for precision, though no factual error.
- **Q2**: The sequence is factually accurate and matches the ground truth content exactly (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order), including order from the log. However, the response adds an unnecessary prefix ("C002 :"), and the underscores are not escaped as in the ground truth (though this appears to be a minor formatting inconsistency in the ground truth itself). Strict evaluation treats the prefix as an extra element, deducting points for deviation from the exact expected format.
- **Q3**: Perfect match—lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) correctly identified from the log (for C002 and C001/C003 respectively), one per line, and alphabetically ordered. No extras, omissions, or hallucinations; presentation aligns with "one per line."

Overall, the response is highly accurate with no fabrications or major errors, but small extras and formatting deviations justify a deduction from a perfect 10.0 under strict criteria.
