9.0

Q1: Correct (“3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003)” → matches “3”).
Q2: Correct sequence and formatting (“Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order”).
Q3: Content is correct (“Arrange_Delivery” and “Check_Stock” appear as expected, in order), but the formatting shows a minor difference: the ground truth maintains the underscore (“Arrange_Delivery” and “Check_Stock”). The LLM uses spaces (“Arrange Delivery”, “Check Stock”).

Per the instruction, small errors—such as loss of underscores—should incur significant penalty. Therefore, a full score (10.0) is not warranted. The answer is factually complete and ordering is correct, but the minor formatting omission impacts strict grading. Therefore:

Final score: 9.0
