7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, rankings, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) are correctly identified and ranked strictly by average waiting time from the table. Both average and 95th-percentile times are quoted verbatim (e.g., 36.5h/120h, etc.). No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities mentioned. (+10 points base)
- **Structure and Constraints**: Memo format is crisp and professional, under 150 words (actual count ~120, excluding headers). Ranks clearly as #1–#3. Adheres to "no unwarranted content." However, the elaborate headers (To/From, Key Findings) deviate slightly from the ground truth's ultra-concise list format, adding minor fluff. (-0.5)
- **Actions**: Each is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., reminders for customer delays, batching for queueing, triage for processing). General projection of ≥20% at the end covers the requirement, but lacks per-action specificity/% like ground truth (e.g., LLM's #2 action assumes reduction without "estimated 30%" detail; #1's "30% faster response rate" is close but not "≥25% cut in queue time"; #3 similar but less precise on "bypass queue"). Actions are data-driven but invent minor unsupported elements (e.g., "24h and 72h" timings, "<$X" threshold) without pilot/test references. (-1.5)
- **Strictness Penalties**: The stray "bastard" in the note is an unprofessional error (typo? artifact?), introducing irrelevant/inappropriate content that undermines the memo's tone—significant deduction for any blemish. Actions differ notably (#2: physical batching vs. ground truth's digital e-signatures), reducing fidelity. (-0.5 total for small variances)

Overall: Strong alignment (80%+ match), but strict criteria penalize imperfections in action precision and the anomalous word, preventing a perfect score.
