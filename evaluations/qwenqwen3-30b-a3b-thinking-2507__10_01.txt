3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology Adherence (Perfect - +2.5 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere. This matches the ground truth and prompt policy strictly.
- **Matrix Structure and Completeness (Good but Minor Flaws - +1.0 point)**: The matrix has the correct activities as rows (6 total, no extras added) and roles as columns (no extra roles or columns). Activities are in the correct order per the process description. However, column headers use abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), while the ground truth uses full names without abbreviationsâ€”this is a small but unnecessary deviation, costing points under strictness. Formatting (e.g., bolding all activities vs. selective in ground truth; "R, A" vs. "**R / A**") is inconsistent with ground truth, reflecting minor presentation errors.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Errors - -3.0 points from base)**: This is the core failure. Assignments must "reflect the narrative" per the rubric, but the LLM's differ substantially from the ground truth across most activities, indicating a flawed interpretation:
  - **Receive Application**: CO assigned "I" (wrong; ground truth "C"); minor error but still a mismatch.
  - **KYC Review**: CO "R, A" (wrong; ground truth "R" only, with AM "A" and FC "C"); AM "I" (wrong; should be "A"); FC "I" (wrong; "C"). Combines R/A incorrectly.
  - **Order Vetting**: CO "I" (wrong; "C").
  - **Payment Clearance**: FC "R, A" (wrong; "R" only, with AM "A" and CO "C"); AM "I" (wrong; "A"); CO "I" (wrong; "C").
  - **Record Update**: AM "I" (wrong; "C"); CO "I" (correct); FC "I" (wrong; "C"); IT "R, A" (wrong; "R" only, no A assigned in ground truth but consulted roles differ). Treats IT as A, ignoring consultations.
  - **Notify Customer**: Exact match (AM "R, A"; others "I").
  - Overall: Only 1/6 activities match fully. LLM incorrectly assumes the performer is always "A" (combining with "R") and defaults all others to "I", ignoring "C" consultations evident in ground truth (e.g., CO/FC input implied in workflow). No activity lacks a single "R" (rubric partial match), but "Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate" is violated (AM should be A for KYC/Payment but isn't). Each mismatch is a significant error under strict rubric, as RACI accuracy is central.
- **Unwarranted Content (Penalty - -1.5 points)**: The added "Notes on RACI assignments" section introduces explanations (e.g., defining R/A/I/C, stating "C not required"), which are not in the ground truth or prompted. This is extra content violating "no unwarranted content" in rubric, even if informative. Self-awareness is N/A, so no deduction there.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Base score starts high for terminology/structure (4.5/10), but RACI differences (5/6 activities wrong) and extras warrant heavy deduction. Small errors (e.g., headers, formatting) compound to prevent higher score. Matches rubric's emphasis on narrative reflection and no extras.
