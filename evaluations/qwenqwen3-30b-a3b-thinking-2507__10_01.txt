8.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- All three required synonyms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are used with correct spelling and capitalization throughout. No forbidden terms appear anywhere.
- No extra tasks, columns, or roles are introduced beyond those specified.
- The matrix columns/rows match the user-provided process steps and roles. 

**Strict Errors and Deductions:**
1. **R/A assignments are not strictly consistent with ground truth:**
   - The LLM marks **both "R" and "A"** for most activities for the performer (e.g., "Receive Application" is R, A for Account Manager), whereas the ground truth may split "R" and "A" across roles, or assign only one.
   - For "KYC Review", the LLM assigns "R, A" to the Compliance Officer, but ground truth assigns R only, and A to Account Manager.
   - For "Order Vetting" and other activities, the LLM often uses "R, A" for one role, rather than splitting R/A or only assigning R/A as in the ground truth.
   - "C" (Consulted) is not assigned anywhere, despite being present in the ground truth for certain steps (e.g., Compliance Officer as C for "Receive Application", "Order Vetting", etc.).

2. **Accountabilities:**
   - "A" is always co-assigned with "R" to the performer of the activity, instead of being assigned separately as in the ground truth. For example, "KYC Review" — ground truth has CO = R, AM = A.

3. **Inform Status:**
   - The LLM assigns "I" to all non-primary roles in every activity, which only sometimes matches ground truth (see Notify Customer: ground truth has I to CO, FC, IT; matches).

4. **Notes:**
   - The LLM states that "C" isn't required in the process. This is inaccurate: ground truth assigns "C" in several places (e.g., CO=C for "Receive Application").
   - The narrative claims that only Responsible or Accountable are assigned, contrary to ground truth.

**Impact:**  
These systematic errors in R/A (and omission of "C") reflect a notable (but not disastrous) deviation from the ground truth. The use of required terminology and correct organization prevents a lower score. However, the lack of granularity in R/A allocation and C omission is serious and, by a strict rubric, results in a substantial penalty.

**Conclusion:**  
- Degree of difference (all on R/A/C columns): Significant but not overwhelming.
- Score: **8.0** – Good structure and terminology, but notable RACI assignment issues, especially missing "C" and overuse of R/A pairing instead of proper splitting.
