### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM correctly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization, and avoids forbidden terms entirely. This aligns with the ground truth and prompt policy, earning baseline points here. However, the ground truth bolds these terms for emphasis, which the LLM omits, constituting a minor formatting deviation.
  
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors - Severe Deduction)**: The core content is fundamentally inaccurate compared to the ground truth, failing to "reflect the narrative" from the process description (e.g., AM handles Receive Application and Notify Customer as primary; CO performs KYC; AM for Order Vetting; FC for Payment; IT for Record Update). Specific discrepancies include:
  - **Receive Application**: CO is C (GT) vs. I (LLM); FC/IT are I (GT) vs. - (LLM). No Responsible clearly assigned in LLM.
  - **KYC Review**: AM is A (GT) vs. C (LLM); FC is C (GT) vs. - (LLM); IT is I (GT) vs. - (LLM); CO is single R (GT) but A/R in LLM (unwarranted dual role).
  - **Order Vetting**: CO is C (GT) vs. - (LLM); IT is I (GT) vs. - (LLM).
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM is A (GT) vs. I (LLM); CO is C (GT) vs. - (LLM); FC is single R (GT) but A/R (LLM, extra A).
  - **Record Update**: AM is C (GT) vs. I (LLM); CO is I (GT) vs. - (LLM); IT is single R (GT) but A/R (LLM, extra A). FC is C in both, but overall row mismatches.
  - **Notify Customer**: CO is I (GT) vs. - (LLM).
  - Systemic issues: LLM frequently uses "-" (not involved) instead of proper I/C (e.g., 8+ instances vs. GT's minimal "-"); reverses notation (A/R vs. GT's R/A or singles); violates "exactly one Responsible per activity" in places (e.g., dual A/R implies ambiguity). These are not minor—each misallocation is a significant error per strict rubric, as RACI must precisely map process roles without invention.

- **Format and Structure (Further Deductions)**: 
  - Headers use abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) with parentheticals, vs. ground truth's full names only—unwarranted shorthand.
  - Extra "Legend" row introduces content not in ground truth or prompt.
  - No bolding on key elements (e.g., preferred terms, R/A notations) as in ground truth.
  - Table alignment and spacing are similar but lack GT's precise markdown (e.g., **R / A** vs. A/R).
  - No extra tasks/roles/columns added, but the additions (legend, abbrevs) still qualify as unwarranted under rubric.

- **Overall Strictness Application**: With "utmost strictness" and "small errors reflect[ing] in significant loss," the vocabulary success prevents a 1.0 floor, but pervasive RACI inaccuracies (core to task), format deviations, and extras drag this to a low score. It shows basic understanding of terms but fails on process fidelity, yielding only partial utility. Equivalent to ~25% alignment with ground truth.
