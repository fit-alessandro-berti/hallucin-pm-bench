**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (matching the "Yes"), provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, and offers a brief justification tied to the inhibitor arc and p4=0, fulfilling the prompt's requirements. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Significant deductions (-2.0 total)** for incompleteness vs. ground truth: sequence omits post-T5 steps (T3, T4) and explicit markings (e.g., `p2=1, p3=1`), reducing clarity and fidelity.
- **Minor but penalized errors (-1.0 total)**: "moving the tokens" (plural, but singular token); lacks depth on inhibitor's permanent disabling effect post-T3 (ground truth's key justification/proof); misses "must fire before T3 if it occurs" insight and full enabling condition (`p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0`).

Core answer aligns but lacks ground truth's precision, formatting, and explanatory rigor.
