The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content for all three questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the precise sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") alphabetically, one per line. Explanatory steps in the LLM response are accurate and do not introduce errors, additions, or hallucinations. No deductions for formatting variations (e.g., underscores in ground truth A2 or bullet styling in A3), as core precision is maintained.
