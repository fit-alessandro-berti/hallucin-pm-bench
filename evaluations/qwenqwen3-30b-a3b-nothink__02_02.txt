The LLM answer is factually correct and matches the ground truth in all respects:

- **Q1:** The answer is "3 distinct cases," matching the expected "3."
- **Q2:** The sequence for C002 is listed exactly as "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order," matching the ground truth answer without any deviation.
- **Q3:** The activities immediately preceding "Ship_Order" are "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock," presented in the correct alphabetical order, also matching the ground truth (including correct use of underscores in the activity names).
