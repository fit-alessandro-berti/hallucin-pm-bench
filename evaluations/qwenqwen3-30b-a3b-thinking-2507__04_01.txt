4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of Overall Conclusion (Non-compliant)**: Matches ground truth (+2.0 points). Both identify violations in Rules 2 and 3 as the basis for non-compliance.
- **Justification for Rule 2**: Core violation correctly identified (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods), but factual errors in timestamps (swapped and incorrect: Ship_Goods listed as 08:44 instead of 09:40; Risk_Assessment as 09:40 instead of 10:31) introduce significant inaccuracy (-2.0 points). Ground truth cites events accurately without timestamp errors.
- **Justification for Rule 3**: Violation correctly identified (Three_way_match too far after Goods_Received), but distance calculation mismatches ground truth (LLM: 4; ground truth: 3), misaligning with the rule's "distance â‰¤ 2" phrasing and ground truth's interpretation (-1.5 points). Timestamps are mostly correct here, but the distance error compounds the issue.
- **Comprehensiveness**: LLM only justifies violations (Rules 2 and 3), omitting checks for Rules 1, 4, and 5, which ground truth explicitly verifies as satisfied. This partial analysis misses demonstrating full rule set evaluation, reducing thoroughness (-2.5 points).
- **Format and Clarity**: Numbered list citing rules is present and concise, aligning with the prompt's requirement, but lacks the structured, exhaustive breakdown of ground truth (+1.0 point, partial credit).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, small errors (e.g., distance discrepancy) and larger ones (e.g., timestamp swaps) result in outsized deductions, as they deviate from ground truth's precision and completeness. No credit for unmentioned satisfied rules.

Total: Starting from 10.0, deductions yield 4.0. The answer is directionally useful but undermined by factual inaccuracies and incompleteness.
