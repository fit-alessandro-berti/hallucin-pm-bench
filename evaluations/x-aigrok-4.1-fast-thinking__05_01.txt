**2.0**

The LLM answer proposes a completely different architecture (parallel fork with race-to-merge gateways + intermediate timer event from start) compared to the ground truth (single interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive + direct flow to Task_Triage). Key differences:
- Adds unpermitted new gateways (parallelGateway "Fork_SLA", exclusiveGateway "GW_Merge"), exceeding "introduce events" allowance.
- Introduces multiple new flows/elements vs. ground truth's minimal 1 event + 1 flow.
- Alters more existing flows (f1, f5, f6) unnecessarily.
- No XML snippet for timer; vague "PT48H".
- Functionally distinct (parallel race vs. boundary interrupt); ignores exact ground truth phrasing/references (e.g., no "outstanding document requests").
Major deviations warrant severe deduction despite similar intent.
