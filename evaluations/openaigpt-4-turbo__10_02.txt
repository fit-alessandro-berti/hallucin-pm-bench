**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary Mandate (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison" exclusively. No violations here.
- **Roles/Columns (major failure, -3.0)**: Missing "Operations Manager" column entirely (present in ground truth). Only 3 columns vs. 4. Introduces no extras but omits key accountable role from GT.
- **Tasks Coverage & Wording (major failure, -2.5)**: Expands source's 6 steps into 8 tasks (adds #7 "Archives" split, #8 "Notifies" as new). Wordings differ significantly from GT (e.g., "Receives the customer’s transfer instruction..." vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; no "(mandated wording)" header phrasing or bolding). Omits exact GT phrasings like "Screen Against Sanctions List", "Release Payment".
- **RACI Assignments (catastrophic failure, -2.5)**: Zero matches across all cells. Every assignment differs (e.g., GT Task 1: R-TA/I-RL/A-OM/C-IT vs. LLM: only R-TA; GT KYC: C-TA/R-RL/A-OM/I-IT vs. LLM: only R-RL). Fabricates assignments (e.g., IT R for notify).
- **Structure & Extras (minor deductions, -1.0)**: Markdown table present, legend OK, but adds unnecessary intro text ("Below is a RACI table...") and explanatory paragraph absent in GT. No post-table notes matching GT.
- **Overall Fidelity to Source & GT (failure)**: Covers source steps but deviates heavily in interpretation/RACI logic. Does not "map every step...without omissions or substitutions" per GT notes.

Total raw alignment ~20% (vocab only); strict scaling yields 2.0. Any match requires near-identical table, roles, tasks, and cells.
