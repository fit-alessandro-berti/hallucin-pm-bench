**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in verdict, coverage of all cases (1001, 1002, 1003), key evidence (reversals, absence in 1002, sequences), and conclusion (never immediately before). It directly addresses "immediately" via sequences and "not adjacent," cites required case IDs/activities, and matches brevity/style (bolded verdict, structured justification). No errors; only negligible phrasing differences (e.g., no line numbers, which are unrequired by prompt).
