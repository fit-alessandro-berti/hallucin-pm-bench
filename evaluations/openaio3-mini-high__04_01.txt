8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the non-compliance conclusion and accurately pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with appropriate citations to events, aligning with the ground truth on these points. However, it deducts points for incompleteness: it fails to systematically evaluate all rules (e.g., omitting confirmations that Rules 1, 4, and 5 are satisfied, as done in the ground truth), which introduces differences in thoroughness and structure. Under utmost strictness, this partial analysis reflects a significant shortfall in mirroring the comprehensive, rule-by-rule justification provided in the ground truth, warranting a deduction of 2.0 points. No factual errors in the violations noted, but the lack of full coverage prevents a higher score.
