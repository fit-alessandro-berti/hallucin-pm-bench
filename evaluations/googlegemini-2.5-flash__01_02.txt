### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall, accurately identifying the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing all required documents without introducing extraneous terminology. It adheres closely to the process flow and uses exact activity names. However, under utmost strictness, point deductions apply for the following differences from the ground truth:

- **Decision Points Structure and Details (deduction: -1.2)**:
  - Ground truth explicitly frames each point with its position in the flow (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for #1; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for #2). The LLM omits this contextual placement, reducing precision in summarizing the process sequence.
  - #1: Ground truth uses concise arrow notation ("⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate... for tie-break"). LLM expands descriptively ("Decides flow based on...") and specifies "proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)", which is accurate but introduces slight verbosity not matching ground truth's brevity and exact phrasing (e.g., no "tie-break" term).
  - #2: LLM lacks the "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" qualifier, a key flow indicator in ground truth.
  - #3: Ground truth uses "**Approve** or **Reject**" with bold emphasis on capitalization; LLM uses "*approve* or *reject*" in italics without matching exact casing or bolding, and repeats the ≥ €15 000 condition redundantly (already covered in #2).
  - Minor formatting: Ground truth uses numbered list with dashed bullets for sub-details; LLM uses numbered with indented bullets—functional but not identical.

- **Required Documents (deduction: -0.4)**:
  - List is complete and matches all items, using exact names from the prompt.
  - Phrasing variances: 
    - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" in LLM vs. "(≤ 3 months)" in ground truth—omission of "old" is a small but noticeable fidelity loss.
    - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" in LLM vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" in ground truth—LLM includes "single" (faithful to prompt), but ground truth abbreviates, creating a mismatch.
    - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" in LLM vs. "(CIS)" in ground truth—extra "template" (from prompt) is accurate but deviates from ground truth's shortening.
  - Ground truth includes a parenthetical note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") emphasizing non-standard aspects; LLM omits this entirely, missing a subtle interpretive element tied to the prompt's warnings.
  - Formatting: Ground truth uses numbered list; LLM uses bullets—not a match.

- **Overall Fidelity (deduction: -0.2)**:
  - Headers: Ground truth uses "#### Decision points" and "#### Required documents"; LLM uses "**Decision Points:**" and "**Required Documents:**"—bold vs. markdown header, minor style inconsistency.
  - No major errors (e.g., no invented terms, all facts correct), but cumulative small phrasing, contextual, and formatting differences prevent a perfect score. The answer is comprehensive but not verbatim-identical, warranting deductions for strict alignment.
