The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, in the proper order, with no extraneous information about other processes. It is semantically identical to the ground truth in content. Minor deductions for formatting differences (e.g., bullet points and bolding vs. inline notation with backticks and â€– symbols) and omission of descriptive phrases ("first parallel block") and the confirmatory sentence ("No other tasks..."), which are present in the ground truth but not strictly required by the prompt.
