9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks and lists all parallel constructs present in Process B. It numbers them in order of appearance, does not mention other processes, and fully complies with the prompt.

However, compared to the ground truth, the answer is slightly less explicit:  
- The ground truth explicitly states ("first parallel block", "second parallel block") for each set and uses the notation `â€–` between task names, while the LLM only numbers the sets and uses a bulleted list for the task names.
- The LLM omits the final clarifying sentence "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," which is part of the ground truth and adds clarity/completeness.

Because the content is accurate but has two small omissions in explicitness and formatting/scope, a small deduction is warranted. Thus, the answer performs at a 9.0 level.
