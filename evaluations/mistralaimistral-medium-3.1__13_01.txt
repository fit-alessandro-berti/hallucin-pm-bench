9.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Exact match in substance ("1 time" vs. "1 occurrence"). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Near-perfect alignment, including total events (18), calculation, and rounding to two decimals (5.56%). Minor phrasing difference (e.g., "≈" vs. exact notation) but no factual error. Negligible deduction.
- **Question 3**: Accurate identification of the single case (A1002). Prompt allows "identifier(s)" for plural possibility, and LLM handles singular correctly. GT adds "only" for emphasis, but this is stylistic, not substantive. No deduction.
- **Question 4**: Provides exactly two valid sampling-related reasons that directly align with two of GT's suggested options (small sample size and temporal bias). Explanations are clear and derived solely from the log (e.g., 18 events, single-day coverage from timestamps). However, LLM's explanations are slightly less detailed than GT's examples (e.g., no mention of variance impact like "±5.56 pp" or precise time window like "morning"), which under strict criteria warrants a small deduction for not fully mirroring the depth of justification.

Overall, the LLM answer is highly faithful to the ground truth, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log, or major deviations. It adheres to the system prompt's constraints. The score reflects utmost strictness, docking 0.5 points only for the minor depth shortfall in Q4 explanations.
