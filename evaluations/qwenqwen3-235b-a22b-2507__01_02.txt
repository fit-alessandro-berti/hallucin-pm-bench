4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially captures the required elements but introduces significant inaccuracies and extras, particularly in the "decision points" summary, warranting a substantial deduction under strict criteria. Below is a breakdown:

#### Alignment with Ground Truth (Decision Points)
- **Core Mismatches (Major Errors, -4.0 points penalty)**:
  - Ground truth identifies exactly 3 decision points: (1) Underwriter Alignment Gate (score difference leads to continue/escalate), (2) Amount Threshold Decision (amount-based auto-approve or escalate to MBA, explicitly after Neighbourhood Feedback Check), (3) Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) (approve/reject vote).
  - LLM incorrectly expands to 5 items, including non-decision steps as "decision points": Quick KYC Verification (KYC) and Community Impact Assessment (CIA). These are procedural verifications/assessments, not branches or gates per the process flow—violating the prompt's focus on "decision points" (e.g., where flow branches). This dilutes accuracy and ignores the exact terminology/flow.
  - Omits explicit context from ground truth, e.g., Amount Threshold Decision occurs "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)".
  - Minor wording deviation: "binding decision" (LLM) vs. "tie-break decision" (ground truth/prompt) for Harmonisation Committee—small but penalized as instructed.

- **Partial Matches (+2.5 points credit)**:
  - Correctly describes the 3 actual decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, MBA) with mostly accurate details, using exact activity names (no standard loan terminology introduced).

#### Alignment with Ground Truth (Required Documents)
- **Core Mismatches (Minor Errors, -1.0 points penalty)**:
  - List is complete and uses exact names/abbreviations (e.g., ML-APP-01, CIS, NFF), matching the prompt's terminology.
  - However, adds unrequested extras: "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" matches prompt but ground truth simplifies to "(pay-stub/tax slip)"—slight phrasing inconsistency; "template" after CIS matches prompt but ground truth omits it; adds "≤ 3 months old" (matches prompt) but ground truth shortens to "(≤ 3 months)".
  - Introduces new content: "⚠️ All documents must be submitted prior to initiation of the **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)**"—not in ground truth or prompt, altering the response.
  - Ground truth includes a closing note ("No credit bureau report...") emphasizing what's *not* needed; LLM omits this, missing a completeness nuance.

- **Partial Matches (+3.0 points credit)**:
  - All 6 documents are listed accurately in substance, with no omissions or inventions.

#### Overall Structure and Fidelity
- LLM uses bolded headings and bullets, while ground truth uses "####" subheadings and numbered lists—functional but not identical; minor style deviation (-0.5 penalty).
- Response is comprehensive but over-expands (e.g., describing CIA's purpose: "evaluate the social or economic benefit"—inferred but not in ground truth/prompt, risking introduction of unstated details).
- Total: Starts from 10.0 baseline, deducts for extras/errors (major in decision points). Score reflects ~55% fidelity: documents near-perfect, but decision points critically flawed.
