The LLM answer is semantically nearly identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A (no rows, no timestamps for "Approve Invoice"), specifying the metrics unable to compute, and providing a precise, one-paragraph explanation without guessing or using outside knowledge. Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary reference to Artefact B (SLA irrelevant to log-based computation, omitted in ground truth); (2) extraneous phrasing like "no case IDs, or activity durations are visible" (activity durations not a column/data type in Artefact A, slight inaccuracy vs. ground truth's precise "all event rows and every timestamp"); (3) bolder/more verbose structure ("**none... exactly**" summary + "Here’s why:", longer than ground truth's concise "Impossible —"); (4) "cycle times, their variability" vs. ground truth's exact "average cycle time nor its dispersion". High fidelity overall, but strictness penalizes these differences.
