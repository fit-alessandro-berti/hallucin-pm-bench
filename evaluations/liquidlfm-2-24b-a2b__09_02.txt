The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to absent timestamps and explaining the precise reason (no start/completion times for duration calculation), with accurate reference to event counts and log limitations. Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary structural split into **Answer**/**Explanation** (adding ~20 words beyond the required "one concise sentence"), (2) slight wording variances ("cannot be determined from the provided artefacts" vs. "impossible ... required start-to-completion intervals are absent"), and (3) plural "cycle times" where singular is implied—small but penalized per strict criteria.
