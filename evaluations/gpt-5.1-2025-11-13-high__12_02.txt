10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and accuracy: it correctly starts with "No" (matching the required "Yes" or "No" only), provides a single-paragraph justification citing exact line numbers and case-IDs, and identifies the precise counterexamples (C003's reversal and C005's lack of Receive_Order) without any factual errors, omissions, or additions that contradict the log or claim. The optional mention of positive cases (C001, C002, C004) adds thoroughness but does not deviate from the verification task or introduce inaccuracies, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements.
