7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Score: 10.0)**: Exact match—both identify 1 occurrence for "Manual Fraud Check" (in CaseID 1002). LLM adds precise location without error or speculation.
- **Part 2 (Score: 6.0)**: LLM stays under 120 words (70) and covers small sample, label variations (synonyms), and sampling bias (overrepresentation of paths, lack of context), aligning broadly with ground truth's emphasis on tiny excerpt and distortions from near-synonyms. However, significant omissions include quantitative details (14 events, 3 cases, <2-hour span), frequency swing (0% to 7%), wide confidence interval, and specific sampling error for rare events—core to ground truth's analytical depth. These gaps reduce insight into statistical unreliability, warranting a major deduction under strict criteria. Unique LLM points (e.g., process variants) are valid but don't compensate for missed precision. Overall weighted average yields 7.5.
