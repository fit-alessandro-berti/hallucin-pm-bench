1.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates catastrophically from the ground truth and prompt requirements, warranting the minimum score under strict criteria. Key failures include:

- **Structural Errors (Major Deduction)**: The table includes extraneous columns for "KYC Review", "AML Screening", and "Risk Scoring", which are activities (meant for rows), not roles. Ground truth has only the four roles as columns (Front-Office Analyst, Compliance Analyst, Compliance Officer, Treasury Ops). This inverts the matrix format entirely, rendering it unusable.

- **Added/Invalid Activities (Major Deduction)**: Introduces non-narrative activities like "Intake Vetting (Non-filing)", "Approval for Payment", "Fund Release", "Notification of Approval", "Escalation for Review", and "Monitoring and Reporting". Prompt forbids adding activities; ground truth sticks to derived narrative steps (e.g., "Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). No merging or renaming, but LLM expands arbitrarily.

- **Incorrect RACI Assignments (Major Deduction)**: Assignments are inaccurate or absent. E.g., "Risk Scoring" is all "N" (no involvement), but ground truth has Compliance Analyst as R, Compliance Officer as A, Front-Office Analyst as C, Treasury Ops as I. "Intake Vetting" lacks proper R/A for Front-Office Analyst and omits C/I roles. Inconsistencies like "Yes", blanks, and "N" (vs. ground truth's "–" for no involvement) compound errors.

- **Formatting and Notation Errors (Significant Deduction)**: Uses "N" inconsistently instead of "–"; adds nonsensical entries (e.g., "Yes" under activity columns); malformed rows (e.g., incomplete "Escalation" row with blanks). Ground truth uses bolding for R/A, precise abbreviations, and clean dashes. No key/explanation in LLM output matches ground truth's clarity.

- **Vocabulary Compliance (Minor Credit, but Overridden)**: Correctly uses mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without leaks or synonyms. However, this single adherence cannot offset the overwhelming violations, as the prompt demands a faithful matrix "using only the authorized vocabulary" for the exact described activities.

- **Completeness and Fidelity**: Covers none of the ground truth activities accurately; ignores escalation logic, notifications, and role interdependencies from the narrative. No coverage of "every activity and role" without additions.

Overall, the output is fundamentally broken and unrelated to the expected RACI matrix, justifying a 1.0 for zero substantive alignment despite basic vocab use.
