10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, accuracy, and content. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match exactly in values and calculations. For question 3, the response is concise (92 words), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue, highlights instability (e.g., unreliability in duration/frequency/impact, outlier risk), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., incorrect assumptions, need for more data), aligning fully with the required elements without invention or deviation. No errors or omissions detected.
