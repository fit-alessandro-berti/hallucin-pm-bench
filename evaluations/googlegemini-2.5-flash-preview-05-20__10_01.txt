6.5

**Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- **Terminology:** The LLM uses "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" throughout—no forbidden terms are present. This is excellent adherence to the vocabulary policy.
- **Structure:** The matrix layout and role labels are accurate and professionally presented.

**Errors and Omissions:**
1. **RACI Assignments:**
   - The LLM assigns only "R, A" to the role actively responsible for each task, but omits marking Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles. The ground truth explicitly designates C and I for several activities and roles.
   - For each activity, the LLM marks only the main role as "R, A" (the combination is not even standard; RACI usually makes R and A explicit and separate), omitting all others. For example:
     - "Receive Application": Only AM is "R, A"; should also include C for CO, I for FC and IT.
     - "KYC Review": Only CO is "R, A"; should also indicate A for AM, C for FC, I for IT.
   - This significantly reduces informational value.

2. **RACI Notation:**
   - The LLM writes "R, A" in single cells, not separated or using conventional RACI matrix forms. The ground truth puts R/A together but also separately marks C and I, offering a full view of responsibility, accountability, consultation, and information stakeholders.

3. **Formatting:**
   - The LLM bolds neither key terms nor RACI assignments, making cross-comparison a little more difficult (minor).

**Strictness:**
Each missing C/I entry for every row/role is a significant loss of correctness according to the user's rubric (“Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points.”). The primary information—the RACI distribution—is incomplete for every activity and role except the main responsible and accountable, leading to a substantial point deduction.

**Conclusion:**  
The main process steps and terminology are handled well, so the answer is not a catastrophic error (not below 5.0), but the strictness required and the several C/I omissions across every row warrant a sharp reduction. Hence, **6.5** is assigned.
