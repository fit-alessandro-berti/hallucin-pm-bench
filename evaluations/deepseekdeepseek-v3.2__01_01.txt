**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Partial Credit, -3.0 deduction)**: LLM identifies 2/3 ground truth points (triage eligibility and amount threshold/routing). Correctly notes eligibility decision and high-value branch logic/outcomes. However, **completely misses the 3rd critical point** ("Final payment approval" at Finance_Controller_PreApprove/Senior_Auditor_Review with approve → payment / reject → end). Also under-emphasizes explicit rejection branches (e.g., "Not eligible → rejected" in triage; no reject framing for approvals). This incompleteness violates "every decision point"; not minor.
- **Required Documents (Partial Credit, -1.0 deduction)**: Lists 6/7 correctly (all except **RefundConfirmationPDF**, explicitly defined in step 6). Notes conditional use of AuditTrail accurately. No introductions of undefined items (good). But missing one required document from the full catalogue is a clear error per "all required documents."
- **Other Strictness Factors (-0.0 further)**: No hallucinations/introductions (e.g., no legacy activity). Structure is clear but less precise than GT table. Minor phrasing (e.g., "€1,000 or less" vs. "≤ €1 000"; "routing decision") is acceptable. Extra intro text is fluff but not violative.
- **Overall**: Strong on covered content (~80% match) but omissions of key elements (1/3 decisions, 1/7 docs) warrant significant penalty under "utmost strictness" and "small errors reflect in significant loss." Equivalent to incomplete/partial compliance.
