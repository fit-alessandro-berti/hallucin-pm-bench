The LLM answer correctly identifies the possibility (yes), provides a valid minimal firing sequence demonstrating T5 before T3 (T1-T2-T5-T3), and offers a concise justification highlighting concurrency, the inhibitor arc's role, and permanent disablement if T3 fires first—closely aligning with the ground truth's core logic. Minor deductions for: (1) omitting the emphatic "must if ever to occur" phrasing (though implied and not strictly required by the prompt); (2) less formal notation for the enabling condition (no explicit ∧ or ≥); (3) slightly vaguer wording on p3 consumption by T4 (misses "last token"); and (4) absence of the ground truth's extraneous (and invalid) T4 step, creating a structural difference despite improving accuracy. These small variances warrant a strict but not severe penalty, as the essential proof of possibility remains intact without introducing errors.
