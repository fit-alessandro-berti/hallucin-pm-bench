The LLM answer correctly identifies and enumerates all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names, order, and separation by commas, fully matching the ground truth content. The minor addition of an introductory sentence does not alter the required output structure or introduce errors, as the core response adheres strictly to the prompt's enumeration requirement. No mentions of other processes or sequential tasks are present.
