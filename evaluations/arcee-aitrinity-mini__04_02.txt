6.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct status and format for R1, R3, R4, R5, R6. Justifications concise (≤20 words). Overall NON-COMPLIANT correct.
- **Major Errors (significant deduction)**: R2 status wrong (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores post-Change_Request approval as "last required," missing timeline violation. Overall lists incomplete violations (omits R2). R5 justification close but less precise than GT.
- **Strictness Applied**: One critical rule mismatch (17% of rules) + incomplete reasoning = substantial penalty despite 83% rule accuracy.
