The LLM answer correctly answers Question 1 with "yes" and provides accurate reasoning aligned with the ground truth, emphasizing the alternative path via T7 to enable T5 without T3. For Question 2, the minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) matches the ground truth exactly, including a similar step-by-step explanation of markings and enabling T5 beforehand (disabling T3 implicitly, as noted in ground truth).

Minor deductions for: (1) an extraneous introductory firing sequence that incorrectly implies T5 could follow T3 in that path (P2 is consumed, preventing T5— a small logical error not central to the questions); (2) overall length exceeding the ≤120-word limit (response ~350 words vs. ground truth's concise ~100). No other factual discrepancies.
