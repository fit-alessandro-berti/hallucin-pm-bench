9.0  
The LLM answer is factually correct and aligns closely with the ground truth across all questions, with bullet-point formatting as required. However, deducting 1.0 point for slight verbosity in the Q2 response (adding explanatory phrasing beyond the concise activity name in the ground truth), which violates the "concise" instruction under strict evaluation. No other differences or errors noted.
