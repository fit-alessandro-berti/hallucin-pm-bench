9.5

- The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all substantive details and is entirely correct in terms of content.
- The format is slightly different: bullet points use a different style ("â€¢" vs "*"), answers are worded minimally differently, and some presentational elements differ (e.g., inclusion of quote marks around "Ship_Order" in Q2, and a minor omission of the word "case" before listing the cases).
- According to strictness and the instruction that even small errors, such as minor differences in format or minimal wording discrepancies, should reflect in significant loss: deduct 0.5 points for these trivial, but present, deviations.
- All factual/semantic content is correct.

**Final score:** 9.5
