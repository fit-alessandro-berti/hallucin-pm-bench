9.5

The LLM answer is essentially correct and matches the ground truth: it clearly states that the requested value cannot be derived and provides accurate reasoning (the lack of timestamps or elapsed-times, the irrelevance of the historical benchmark). The only minor shortcoming is that it could have mentioned, as emphasized in the ground truth, that even ordering information is unavailable and that any numeric response would be fabricatedâ€”a more explicit warning against guessing. This is a small omission, but per instructions, even small errors should impact the score.
