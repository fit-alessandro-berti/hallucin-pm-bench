**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict line-by-line comparison):
- **Q1/A1**: Factual match (3 distinct cases). Minor deduction (-0.4) for unasked extra list "(C001, C002, C003)" and phrasing "Distinct cases:" (extra elements per instructions). Format differs (Q1 bold vs **A1** | **3**).
- **Q2/A2**: Exact factual and sequence match (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order, including underscores and → separator). Minor deduction (-0.2) for extra header "Case “C002” activity sequence:" and quotes (not in ground truth). Format close but differs (**Q2** vs **A2** |).
- **Q3/A3**: Exact factual match (distinct activities: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock; correctly alphabetical; one per line). Minor deduction (-0.2) for extra header "(alphabetical):" and missing "-" prefixes + <br> (ground truth uses "- Arrange_Delivery<br>- Check_Stock").

**Overall**: Perfect factual precision, no missing/fabricated/hallucinated content, correct ordering/sequence. Deductions only for minor extras and format variances (strict per instructions: small errors = significant loss, but quantified proportionally as differences are non-substantive). Total deduction: 0.8 from 10.0.
