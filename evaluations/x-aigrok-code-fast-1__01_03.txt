5.5

### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Part (a): Decision Points
The LLM answer correctly identifies the two decision points and describes their rules accurately in one sentence each, closely aligning with the ground truth. Minor differences include:
- Slight rephrasing (e.g., "proceed by skipping" vs. "bypasses"; "yields a risk rating of Low or Medium" vs. "risk rating is Low or Medium"), which are semantically equivalent but not identical.
- Addition of "otherwise, the application fails and does not proceed" in the TriVote description, which is a logical inference but not present in the ground truth or process description, introducing unnecessary speculation.
These small deviations warrant a deduction, but the core accuracy is high. Sub-score: 9.0/10.0.

#### Part (b): Documents List
Significant omissions and errors reduce this severely:
- Missed the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicitly listed as inputs/documents in Step 3 of the process and appear first in the ground truth.
- Lists "Offer Sheet 77" but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" from Step 8, treating them as one when the process distinguishes the unsigned preparation (Step 7) from the signed version (Step 8).
- Correctly includes the other five documents (Form 14B, Deck Memo, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025) in order.
- No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), which avoids further penalty but does not compensate for incompleteness.
This results in only ~55% coverage of the required 9 documents, a major factual gap under strict evaluation. Sub-score: 2.0/10.0.

#### Overall Score Calculation
Averaging sub-scores (weighted equally as the prompt has two balanced parts) yields (9.0 + 2.0)/2 = 5.5. This reflects high fidelity in (a) but unacceptable incompleteness in (b), with strict penalties for omissions as instructed.
