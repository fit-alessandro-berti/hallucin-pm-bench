**Score: 6.0**

**Analysis:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM answer captures both decision points correctly, with reasonably clear and accurate one-sentence rules.
    - Small point loss: The LLM refers to the step as “Conditional Branch at Step 4” and “Decision Gate 'TriVote' at Step 6”, which is fine, but its summary of the TriVote rule (“the application passes if at least two out of three approvals”) could be phrased more precisely (e.g. “may advance only when at least two of the three…”). This is somewhat subjective but is only a minor deviation.
    - More significantly, it does not explicitly state that if the vote fails, the process stops — “does not proceed” can be inferred but isn't specific per the description.
- The LLM omits step counts and explicit labeling but otherwise gives correct descriptions. Slight lack of explicitness is a minor loss.

**b) Required Documents**

- The LLM's list is incomplete and thus substantially incorrect against the grading standard.
    - It **omits** three process-critical documents: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow, and also omits “Signed Offer Sheet 77.”
    - The order is also slightly off, as it lists Offer Sheet 77 before “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” which is a separate document.
    - It does NOT hallucinate any out-of-process/KYC documents, which is good.
- Given the instructions for strictness and that “small errors should reflect in significant loss,” omitting four required documents (especially the Scorecards) is a major deviation.

**Conclusion**

- Decision points: Good, but not perfect; slight phrasing and explicitness issues.
- Documents: **Critically incomplete**.

**Final Score: 6.0 — major deduction due to document omissions, with some deduction for imprecise or implicit phrasing.**
