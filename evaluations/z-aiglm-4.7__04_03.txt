The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying "No" compliance due to the exact same Rule 3 violation (NA before RA), with proper assessments for all rules. Justifications reference each rule as required, are concise, and align semantically with the ground truth. Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for strictness: (1) Rule 1 omits explicit "once each" confirmation despite rule text requiring it (ground truth states "appears once"); (2) Rule 2 omits restating "Severity is High" condition (ground truth includes it); (3) bullet format vs. table is functionally equivalent but not identical. No factual errors or additional violations/misses.
