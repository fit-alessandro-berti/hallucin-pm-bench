### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides evidence-based justifications tied to case IDs, activities, and timestamps, aligning with the prompt's requirements for a short, data-strict response. It effectively disproves the "always" claim by highlighting order reversals in Cases 1001 and 1003, and notes the absence in Case 1002 as non-applicable, which supports invalidating the universal assertion.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Minor but significant phrasing error (deduct 1.5 points):** In Case 1002, the LLM inaccurately states that "Authorize_Refund" occurs "before" Update_Inventory despite correctly noting its absence; this is logically impossible and misleading, as the activity never occurs to establish any precedence. The ground truth handles this more precisely by directly stating the absence disproves "always" without implying a non-existent order.
- **Incomplete emphasis on totality (deduct 0.5 points):** The conclusion focuses on deviations in Cases 1001 and 1003 but does not explicitly state (as the ground truth does) that the claimed sequence occurs in *none* of the cases, slightly weakening the comprehensive refutation.
- Strengths (no deduction): Citations are equivalent (timestamps vs. line numbers), structure is clear and concise, no hallucinations or guesses beyond the data, and it adheres to the system's meticulous, evidence-only mandate.

Overall, the response is strong (80% fidelity) but the phrasing imprecision and subtle incompleteness warrant the deductions for strict alignment with the ground truth.
