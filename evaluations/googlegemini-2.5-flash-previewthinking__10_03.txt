4.0

The LLM answer contains some important errors and deviations from the ground truth and instructions:

1. **Vocabulary compliance (Minor):**  
   - The required terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") are used correctly, and forbidden synonyms do not appear in the activity names. However, the activity "Scheduling Payment" appears instead of "Release Funds" (permissible activity names are not to be added or renamed), and an extra activity "Notifying Originating Analyst" is included (not in ground truth). This is a direct violation of "do not rename, merge, or add activities."

2. **Activities deviating from ground truth (Major):**  
   - Added activities: “Compliance Officer Approval”, “Scheduling Payment”, “Releasing Funds”, “Notifying Originating Analyst” cannot be justified given the strict instruction to not add or rename activities.
   - The correct final activity should be “Release Funds” only, per the ground truth, not “Scheduling Payment”, “Releasing Funds”, “Notifying Originating Analyst”.

3. **Matrix Role Assignments (Moderate–Major):**  
   - For “Intake Vetting”, C is missing for Compliance Analyst; I is wrongly given for Compliance Officer (should be dash).
   - For “KYC Review”, C is missing for Compliance Officer; dash should be shown for Front-Office Analyst (not I).
   - For “AML Screening”, same issues as above.
   - For “Risk Scoring”, Responsible should be only Compliance Analyst, Accountable should be Compliance Officer; matrix gives “A, R” to Compliance Analyst and “C” to Compliance Officer/Treasury Ops (incorrect).
   - "Compliance Officer Approval": Inform is shown for Front-Office Analyst/Treasury Ops (should be I only for Front-Office Analyst, dash elsewhere); Compliance Officer is A, R (OK); Compliance Analyst is marked R (should be C); Treasury Ops is not involved at all (should be dash, not I).
   - “Release Funds”: Not in correct form in answer—appears split into “Scheduling Payment”, "Releasing Funds", and "Notifying Originating Analyst" rather than as a single activity; RACI assignments for these do not map cleanly to the actual ground truth.

4. **Formatting errors (Minor):**  
   - The ground truth format is not followed precisely: dash (–) is not used, and multiple extra activities are added to the list.

**Summary:**  
While the LLM uses only the authorized vocabulary for the key named activities, it violates the instruction by changing, splitting, or adding activities. The RACI values do not match the ground truth and show consistent assignment errors. Both major and minor errors occur throughout, warranting a strict deduction and a final score of 4.0.
