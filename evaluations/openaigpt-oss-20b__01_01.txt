### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is comprehensive and accurate in listing all required documents without introducing extras, matching the ground truth's catalogue exactly (including the conditional note on *AuditTrail*). It infers denial paths logically from the process constraints, which aligns with the prompt's intent to summarize decision points. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Decision points (major differences, -2.0 points)**: The structure identifies three points similar in number but diverges in content and sequencing. The first (eligibility in *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*) matches closely. The second (explicit approval/deny at *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* before branching) adds an inferred rejection not separated in the ground truth, which combines it into a "final payment approval." The third (implicit high-value check) is similar to the ground truth's amount threshold but lacks the combined approval/rejection outcome at *Finance/Senior*. This misaligns branching logic, treating Finance as a standalone binary decision rather than part of a post-branch final checkâ€” a core interpretive error reflecting ~40% mismatch.
  
- **Documents (minor differences, -0.5 points)**: Complete and exhaustive list of all seven artifacts. Extra purposes/required-by details are accurate inferences from the description but unrequested, slightly bloating beyond a simple "list." The high-value note on *AuditTrail* matches, but the tabular format vs. ground truth's numbered list adds unnecessary structure.

No introduction of undefined activities/artifacts (e.g., no legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide"), and the answer stays within bounds. Overall fidelity is strong (~75% alignment), but decision point discrepancies are significant enough for deduction, preventing a higher score.
