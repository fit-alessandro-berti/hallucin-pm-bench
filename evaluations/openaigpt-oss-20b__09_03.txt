The LLM answer is accurate, concise, and identifies that the calculation is impossible due to missing data (all rows and timestamps have been redacted). It also clearly refers to both lack of start/completion timestamps and the inability to link data to specific cases. However, compared to the ground truth, it is marginally wordier and slightly less direct in stating explicitly that "Artefact A contains only column headers." Minor differences in emphasis (“event-log data that would provide…” vs. simply stating the data are absent, as in the ground truth) account for a small deduction, but no substantive errors are present. This warrants a very high score, but not a perfect one, per instructions for utmost strictness.
