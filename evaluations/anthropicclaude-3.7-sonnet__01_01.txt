The LLM answer identifies only one decision point (the high-value branch), omitting two critical ones from the ground truth: the eligibility validation (which implicitly decides continuation vs. rejection) and the approval/rejection at pre-approval/auditor review stages (per process flow and constraints). This is a major incompleteness, as the prompt requires summarizing *every* decision point, leading to substantial point loss under strict evaluation. The documents list is accurate and complete, matching the ground truth (including the conditional AuditTrail), with no introductions of undefined elementsâ€”preventing a total failure. Minor issues like inconsistent activity naming (e.g., "PreApproval" vs. "PreApprove") and lack of table structure do not further deduct but highlight superficial adherence.
