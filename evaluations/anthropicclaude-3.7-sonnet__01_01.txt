6.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the key process branch (high-value determination after Finance_Controller_PreApprove) and lists all required documents without inventing any extras. However, significant strictness in grading is warranted for the following reasons:

**Errors/Omissions in the LLM Answer:**
1. **Missed decision points:**
   - The answer omits the *eligibility check* decision at Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility (i.e., is the claim eligible or not?).
   - It also omits the crucial *final payment approval* (approval or rejection) that occurs after the Senior_Auditor_Review (for claims > €1,000) or after Finance_Controller_PreApprove (for smaller claims). These were both asked for in the prompt.

2. **Detail loss in branching logic/outcomes:**
   - The LLM answer does not specify rejection possibilities (e.g., claim not eligible, payment not approved), nor does it mention process termination/non-payment outcomes.

3. **Document list minor inaccuracy:**
   - Although all documents are included, the conditionality of AuditTrail ("high-value claims only") is mentioned, but it's not as explicit as in the ground truth.

**Positive Aspects:**
- The document list is complete and no unauthorized activities or artefacts are introduced.
- The high-value branching logic is described, although without complete detail.

**Conclusion:**
- Major deduction (–3) for omitting 2 out of 3 actual decision points.
- Additional penalty (–1) for lack of detail on outcomes and process completeness at decision points.
- Slight deduction (–0.5) for not matching the explicitness/format of the ground truth regarding conditionality.
- Overall: 6.0.
