9.0  
The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the ground truth. No extraneous information about Processes A or C is included, fully adhering to the prompt.  

However, under utmost strictness:  
- Missing descriptive headers ("**Set 1 – first parallel block:**" and "**Set 2 – second parallel block:**"), deducting 0.5 points.  
- Different formatting for parallelism (comma-separated with **bold** vs. `backticks` with ‖ symbol), deducting 0.5 points.  
- Absence of confirmatory sentence ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel."), deducting 0.0 points (not explicitly required by prompt, but present in ground truth).  

Core content is identical (100% match on tasks and structure), justifying a high score despite minor presentational differences.
