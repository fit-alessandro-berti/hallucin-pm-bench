9.5

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in conclusion (No), violation identification (correctly Rule 3), and per-rule assessments/reasoning (all accurate, including order, positions, severity handling, and requirements). Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly stating "once each" for Rule 1 (ground truth does, though implied and trace-compliant); (2) bullet-list format vs. table (stylistic difference, but prompt allows "short justification"); (3) slightly less emphatic phrasing (e.g., no "✔/❌" symbols or bolded summary). Under utmost strictness, these small presentation/content nuance differences warrant a 0.5-point loss from perfect.
