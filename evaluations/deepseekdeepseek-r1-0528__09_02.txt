The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps and provides a clear reason, aligning closely with the ground truth. However, there is minor, unnecessary elaboration (“to measure individual durations”), and the phrasing is slightly less concise compared to the ultra-strict brevity of the ground truth. The core reasoning and conclusion are correct, but for utmost strictness and conciseness, a tiny point is deducted.
