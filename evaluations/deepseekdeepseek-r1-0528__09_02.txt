9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt by clearly stating the impossibility and providing a precise reason tied to the absence of timestamps and presence of only frequencies/counts, aligning closely with the ground truth's core message. A minor deduction for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and "no temporal data" vs. "no timestamps or duration information") prevents a perfect score under strict evaluation, though the intent and factual basis are identical.
