9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Both responses correctly refuse to provide a numeric value, explicitly state the impossibility (LLM: "cannot be derived"; Ground Truth: "cannot be computed"), and explain due to missing timestamps/durations. LLM directly mirrors the system instruction phrasing ("cannot be derived"). Covers both questions (1: states impossibility; 2: brief explanation). No fabrication or misuse of historical benchmarks.
- **Differences/Deductions (strict penalties)**:
  - LLM unnecessarily scopes limitation "for that activity" (-0.4), implying possible data for others; Ground Truth correctly generalizes to entire "excerpt" lacking timestamps/durations/ordering for all events.
  - Misses explicit mention of "ordering information" and "temporal value per event" (-0.2), reducing precision on why cycle time (activity-level or case-level) fails.
  - Lacks Ground Truth's warning against "fabricated" answers and structured formatting (bold, >, **Reasoning**) (-0.1), slightly less emphatic/pedagogical.
  - Minor: Uses "cycle time" without clarifying activity context; Ground Truth ties directly to log contents (-0.1).
- Overall: Extremely close in substance (95%+ semantic match), but strict criteria penalize phrasing precision and completeness for full 10.0.
