The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) matching the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3 by preserving the P2 token. The explanation concisely covers the key mechanism (executing the P1 branch to enable T5 while leaving P2 untouched and disabling T3 afterward), aligning with the ground truth's logic. However, it omits intermediate markings (e.g., M₁ = {P1, P2}), explicit step-by-step state verification, and Q1-specific explanation phrasing, reducing precision and completeness relative to the ground truth. Structure is slightly less formal (comma list vs. numbered), warranting a minor deduction under strict criteria. Word count (≈70) complies with ≤120 limit.
