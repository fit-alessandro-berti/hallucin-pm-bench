3.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Partial correctness (timer addition)**: The LLM correctly identifies the need for an interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` with a 48-hour duration (`PT48H`), which addresses the core SLA enforcement mechanism without new activities (+2.0 points).
- **Major error in routing/escalation**: The LLM routes the timeout to `End_Rejected` (immediate rejection), ignoring the pre-existing unused `Activity_AMReview` escalation task explicitly highlighted in the XML comments and business context. This fails to utilize the intended escalation path, directly contradicting the ground truth's focus on routing to the existing review task for SLA compliance without rejection (+0 points; significant deduction of -4.0 for core functional mismatch).
- **XML minor issues**: Omits `name` attribute on the boundary event and `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on the time duration (present in original XML and ground truth), introducing inconsistencies (-0.5 deduction).
- **Justification inaccuracy**: The one-sentence explanation mentions routing to rejection, which does not leverage the escalation activity and misaligns with the ground truth's emphasis on using pre-existing elements (-1.0 deduction).
- **Overall strictness**: The response is functional but fundamentally deviates from the optimal, context-aware solution (using unused escalation), resulting in only partial credit under utmost strict evaluation.
