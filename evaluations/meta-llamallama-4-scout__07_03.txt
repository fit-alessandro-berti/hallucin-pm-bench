7.0

The LLM answer misses an important required gateway type change:  
- It does not mention "Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel", which is present in the ground truth answer and completely verifiable from the XML.

All listed tasks and the other gateway type change are correct and formatted in compliance with the requested structure. However, the omission of a required element in the "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" section is a significant error.

Formatting otherwise matches, and no extra or missed changes exist on tasks.  
Therefore, applying strict grading, this answer deserves a significant point deduction but is not completely wrong, thus 7.0.
