The LLM answer misses the gateway type change for `Gateway_Payment` (exclusive â†’ parallel), which is a verifiable functional difference present in the ground truth. This omission represents a major incompleteness in reporting "all" changes under the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES heading. Additionally, minor formatting discrepancies exist (e.g., leading dashes before headings in the LLM answer, absent in the ground truth; slight alignment differences in the gateway listing). While added and removed tasks match perfectly, the strict criteria demand significant point deduction for the substantive error and formatting inconsistencies.
