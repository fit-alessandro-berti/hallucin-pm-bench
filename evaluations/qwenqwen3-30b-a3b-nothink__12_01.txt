### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a valid, evidence-based justification using specific timestamps and activities from cases 1002 and 1003, which serve as clear counterexamples (absence of "Update_Inventory" in 1002 and reversed order in 1003). This aligns well with the ground truth's emphasis on disproving the "always" claim through concrete event-log evidence. The response is concise, cites relevant case IDs as requested, and adheres to the prompt's instruction for a short justification without speculation.

However, under utmost strictness, the answer is incomplete: it omits case 1001 entirely, where "Update_Inventory" explicitly precedes "Authorize_Refund" (a direct reversal of the claimed order), missing a key piece of data from the provided log. This represents a significant omission relative to the ground truth's thorough coverage of *all three cases*, violating the system instruction to base statements strictly on the full dataset without selective focus. The phrasing is slightly less structured (no explicit "verdict" mirroring the ground truth), and the justification could be tighter on why these cases disprove "immediately before" across the board. These differences warrant a deduction, but the core accuracy and partial evidence prevent a lower score.
