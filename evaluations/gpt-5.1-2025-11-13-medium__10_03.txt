### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Added and renamed activities (major violation)**: The prompt forbids adding, renaming, or merging activities. The LLM introduces two unauthorized rows ("Schedule payment" and "Notify originating analyst"), which are not distinct activities in the ground truth or narrative. It also renames "Compliance Officer Approval" to "Compliance Officer approval for high-scoring cases," adding descriptive text that alters the exact phrasing. Ground truth has exactly 6 rows; LLM has 8. This alone merits severe deduction (~4 points loss).

- **Incorrect RACI assignments (pervasive errors)**: Nearly every cell differs, often missing Consulted (C) or Informed (I) roles or misassigning Responsible (R)/Accountable (A):
  - **Intake Vetting**: Misses Compliance Analyst (C) and Treasury Ops (I); ground truth specifies these.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: Misses Compliance Officer (C) and Treasury Ops (I); assigns only R,A to Compliance Analyst, ignoring broader involvement.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Fundamentally wrong—LLM assigns R,A solely to Compliance Analyst; ground truth has Compliance Analyst (R), Compliance Officer (A), Front-Office Analyst (C), and Treasury Ops (I).
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Misses Front-Office Analyst (I); incorrectly adds Treasury Ops (I) where ground truth uses – (no involvement).
  - Added rows have no ground truth equivalents, making all assignments invalid.

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses blank cells instead of – for no involvement (ground truth standard). Lacks bolding on activity names and key R,A cells as in ground truth. Table header and structure are close but not identical (e.g., spacing, capitalization).

- **Vocabulary compliance**: Correctly uses the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms, which is a minor positive but insufficient to offset other flaws.

These errors compound across structure, content, and fidelity to the prompt, resulting in only partial alignment on core terms. No single row fully matches ground truth.
