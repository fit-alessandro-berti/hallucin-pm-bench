2.0

The LLM answer has several critical differences from the ground truth, resulting in a semantically incomplete and partially invalid BPMN model under strict evaluation. Key issues include:

- **Omission of required connection**: No sequence flow from the start event to the "Validate Claim" task, leaving the process unstartable (ground truth has `wrc_sf1` for this).
- **Hallucinated/non-standard elements**: Uses invalid `<parallelSplitGateway>` and `<parallelJoinGateway>` elements (BPMN 2.0 requires `<parallelGateway>` for both split and join, as in ground truth); adds unnecessary `camunda` namespace; includes invented flow names like "Activity A", "Activity B", and "Receive Missing Information" (ground truth only names decision flows).
- **Extra elements**: Includes an unmentioned "Check Warranty Eligibility" task and its preceding flow (ground truth omits this, routing directly from completeness gateway to warranty gateway); this adds unrequired structure.
- **Task and event name mismatches**: Names do not match verbatim or ground truth precisely, e.g., "Validate Claim" (missing "the", vs. ground truth "Validate the claim"); "Create Shipment Order" (capitalization differs from prompt/ground truth "Create shipment order"); end events "Process Ended (Rejection)" and "(Success)" vs. ground truth "Rejected" and "Successful end"; start event capitalization and wording variations.
- **Structural/attribute differences**: Unprefixed elements (vs. ground truth's `bpmn:` prefix); `isExecutable="true"` (vs. "false"); process ID casing "wrc_Process" (vs. "wrc_process"); extra gateway names like "Parallel Activities Start/End" (ground truth gateways have minimal or implied names).

These errors make the output non-equivalent, with hallucinations, omissions, and invalid BPMN constructs warranting severe deductions. Semantically, it covers the loop and parallel paths but breaks flow validity and adds extras.
