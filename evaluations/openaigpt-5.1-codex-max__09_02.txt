The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise (one sentence as prompted), and correctly identifies the absence of timestamps/durations for start/completion events as the reason the average cycle time cannot be calculated. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences ("can’t be calculated" vs. "impossible to compute"; "durations were provided" vs. "duration information are provided—only event counts"; omission of explicit "intervals absent" clause), which under utmost strictness warrant a small but noticeable point loss despite semantic equivalence.
