4.0

- **Vocabulary correctness:** The LLM answer uses only the authorized vocabulary for all activities, which is correct. No synonyms or variations leak through, satisfying a key requirement for this assessment.
- **Activity alignment:** There are significant deviations from the required activities:
    - The matrix introduces "Payment Approval", "Payment Scheduling", and "Payment Release" as discrete activities, none of which are named this way in the ground truth or described with these names in the instructions.
    - It omits "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds", using nonstandard labels and thus not matching the explicit activity set from the ground truth ("do not rename, merge, or add activities").
- **Structure & Format:** The answer does not maintain the exact activity names. It splits fund-release steps into three: "Payment Approval", "Payment Scheduling", and "Payment Release" vs. simply "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" in the ground truth. This merging/splitting is disallowed and constitutes a serious error.
- **RACI accuracy:**
    - Roles and assignments for each activity often don't match the ground truth. For example, "KYC Review" lists only Compliance Analyst as both Responsible and Accountable, omitting the ground truth’s listing of Treasury Ops as "Informed" and Compliance Officer as "Consulted."
    - Several "Consulted" and "Informed" roles are missing or misplaced across the activities.
    - For "Risk Scoring", the answer assigns R to Compliance Analyst and A to Compliance Officer; the ground truth makes Compliance Officer only Accountable, and puts Compliance Analyst as R, with Front-Office Analyst as C.
- **Table orientation:** The ground truth presents a role-centric table, while the LLM uses an activity-centric one (roles as cell contents, not as columns). This change reduces clarity and prevents easy comparison.
- **Other issues:**
    - A footnote is used to explain conditional escalation for approval, which is unnecessary per instructions and may imply process uncertainty.
    - Minor format differences (e.g., use of "-") also suggest a lack of slavish adherence to the reference.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer earns points for strictly using required vocabulary and avoiding forbidden synonyms, but loses points heavily for:
- Fragmenting or renaming activities versus instructions,
- Significant observed mismatches in RACI assignments,
- Failing to follow the required format and structure,
- Adding/merging activities.

**Overall: 4.0** — Correct terms, but serious errors in activity definitions, assignments, and table structure per strict instructions.
