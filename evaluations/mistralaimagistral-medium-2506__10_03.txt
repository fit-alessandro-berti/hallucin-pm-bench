4.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt but exhibits numerous deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Key differences include structural mismatches, activity naming/handling errors, incomplete or incorrect RACI assignments, and extraneous elements. Even minor variances (e.g., missing bolding, added notes) contribute to point deductions. Breakdown:

- **Vocabulary Adherence (Strength; +1.5 points)**: Correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly, with no synonyms or leaks. No deductions here, but this is baseline compliance.

- **Table Structure and Format (-2.5 points)**: Major deviation. LLM uses a traditional RACI column format (Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed) with roles filled in cells. Ground truth transposes this (roles as columns, R/A/C/I/– combined in cells per activity row), includes bolding for activities and R/A indicators, and uses en-dashes (–) for no involvement. This alters the presentation significantly, violating strict fidelity to the expected output style implied by the ground truth.

- **Activities Covered (-2.0 points)**: Prompt requires covering "every activity" without renaming, merging, or adding. LLM correctly includes the four core activities but:
  - Renames "escalation/approval" to "Payment Approval*" (vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval").
  - Adds/splits unmentioned sub-activities: "Payment Scheduling" and "Payment Release" (narrative mentions "schedule the payment" and "releases the funds" as part of Treasury Ops' role, but ground truth merges into "Release Funds"). This constitutes adding and splitting, directly against instructions.
  - Includes a footnote/asterisk for conditionality, which is explanatory but not in ground truth and risks "adding" content.
  - Ground truth has exactly 6 activities; LLM has 7, inflating scope.

- **RACI Assignments (-2.8 points)**: Significant inaccuracies and omissions across most activities, missing implied consultations/informations from process flow (e.g., notifications, escalations). Specific mismatches:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM (R/A: Front-Office; I: Compliance) omits Treasury I and shifts Compliance to I instead of C. Partial credit for R/A.
  - **KYC Review**: LLM (R/A: Compliance; I: Treasury) misses Officer C.
  - **AML Screening**: LLM (R/A: Compliance; no I/C) misses Officer C and Treasury I; treats as isolated vs. ground truth's flow integration.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM (R: Compliance; A: Officer) misses Front C and Treasury I.
  - **Approval (Payment Approval vs. Compliance Officer Approval)**: LLM (R/A: Officer; I: Treasury) misses Front I and Compliance C.
  - **Scheduling/Release (Added/Split vs. Release Funds)**: LLM assigns R/A: Treasury; I: Front-Office for both, but ground truth combines into "Release Funds" with broader C/I (Compliance C, Officer C, Front I). This mismatches scope and adds uninstructed granularity; partial credit for Treasury R/A.
  - Overall, Consulted is underused (mostly "-"), ignoring ground truth's emphasis on flow (e.g., Officer C for reviews). No role fully Informed where narrative implies (e.g., originating analyst notifications).

- **Completeness and Fidelity (-1.0 point)**: Covers all roles but not "every activity" precisely (e.g., no explicit handling of notification as Informed). Adds "Notes" section post-table, which is unauthorized and interpretive, despite prompt's "Return the matrix as a Markdown table" with no extras. Small errors like inconsistent dash styling (-) vs. (–) and lack of bolding compound this.

Total: Starts at 10, deducts ~8.8 for cumulative errors, yielding 4.2. The answer is functional but not a close match—more of a reinterpretation than faithful reproduction.
