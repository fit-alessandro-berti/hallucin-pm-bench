The LLM answer demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of "decision points," incorrectly including non-branching steps (e.g., KYC, CIA, NFC) as decisions, misnaming key activities (e.g., "Dual Underwriter Split alignment" instead of "Underwriter Alignment Gate"; adding "Neutral" to "Harmonisation Committee"; using "primary/shadow" instead of exact "Senior/Shadow"), and altering details (e.g., combining threshold with board approval). This deviates substantially from the ground truth's concise, accurate focus on true branching points. For required documents, minor wording discrepancies (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "CIS template" vs. "CIS") and lack of the explanatory note further reduce alignment, warranting significant point deductions under strict evaluation criteria.
