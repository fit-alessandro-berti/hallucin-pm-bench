4.5

**Justification:**

**Positive points:**
- The required documents list is accurate and complete.
- The main high-level decision points are referenced.
- Terminology is mostly preserved (using process activity names).

**Major errors and omissions:**

1. **Structure and Precision:**  
   - The LLM answer lists *every process step as a 'decision point'* (e.g., "KYC Verification" and "Community Impact Assessment" are NOT process decision points; they are exercises/steps).
   - The real *decision points* are only **Underwriter Alignment Gate**, **Amount Threshold Decision**, and (conditionally) **Final Micro-loan Board Approval**.

2. **Incorrect Use of Terms:**  
   - The answer introduces "Neutral Harmonisation Committee," whereas the process uses strictly the term "Harmonisation Committee".
   - Underwriter Alignment is described as "Dual Underwriter Split alignment (primary/shadow risk score discrepancy ≤ 2)", incorrectly labeling the main split task as the decision check. The decision point is specifically the "Underwriter Alignment Gate" following the two separate scores.

3. **Process Sequencing and Logic:**  
   - By treating steps like KYC Verification, CIA, and NFC as 'decision points', the answer overstates the role of those stages and misrepresents the flow.

4. **Amount Threshold Decision Imprecision:**  
   - The summary says "(≥ €15,000 requires Final Micro-loan Board Approval)", but omits that amounts < €15,000 are *system auto-approved*. This is a critical aspect of the decision flow.

5. **Missing/Incorrect Enumeration:**  
   - The essential branching at the Underwriter Alignment Gate is not explicitly, clearly broken out.
   - "Final Micro-loan Board Approval" is grouped as just another step, not as a decision with outcomes—"approve/reject" is only mentioned as an aside.

**Summary:**
The answer is not faithful to the structure or terminology required for “decision points” as stipulated. Because small deviations should *substantially* reduce the score (as per instructions), and the misunderstanding of decision points is a notable process error, this falls under a moderate-to-major error band, but NOT a total failure because required documents are correct and the fundamental steps referenced.

**Final: 4.5**
