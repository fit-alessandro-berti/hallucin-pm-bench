**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) – Decision Points (8/10)**: Identifies both correct decision points with accurate rules in one sentence each. Minor deductions for phrasing ("combined risk rating" not in process; "passes if any two ... approve it" vs. ground truth's "advance only when at least two ... record 'Approve'"; names "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" instead of "Risk-based skip after"). Strictness penalizes these small divergences (~2 points off).
- **Part (b) – Documents (0/10)**: Catastrophic failure. Lists only 5/9 documents, **completely omitting** the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow – explicitly listed as step 3 inputs/documents) and **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (distinct document in step 8). Fails to distinguish "Signed" version. Order of listed items is correct but irrelevant due to massive incompleteness. This alone warrants near-zero for the section.
- **Overall**: Strong on (a), but (b) errors are substantive omissions of explicitly stated elements, violating "all documents ... in the order they first appear." No hallucinations (good), but strict policy demands heavy penalty for incompleteness/differences. Weighted average yields 3.5 (not lower only due to perfect decision count in (a)).
