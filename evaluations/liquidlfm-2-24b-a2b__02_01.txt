**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring):
- **Q1**: Correct (3 distinct cases: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). +2.0 points.
- **Q2**: Completely incorrect ("Validate_Order" vs. ground truth "Pack_Items"). Sequence reconstruction for A-9321 failed (timestamps show Pack_Items at 09:01 immediately before Ship_Order at 09:20). -2.0 points.
- **Q3**: Correct (earliest timestamp matches exactly). +2.0 points.
- **Q4**: Correct (Quality_Check occurs twice: B-1045 and C-77). +2.0 points.
- **Q5**: Incorrect list. Contains two correct items ("Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") but substitutes "Quality_Check" (which *is* first for C-77) for the missing "Validate_Order" (which never starts a case). Factual error in identifying first events per case; no partial credit for inexact match under strictness. -2.0 points.

**Total: 4.0/10.0**. Two major factual errors (Q2 fully wrong, Q5 compositionally wrong despite partial overlap) reflect failure to sort events by timestamp per case ID, core to process-mining analysis. Minor matches do not offset strict penalty for differences.
