7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a solid counterexample from Case 1001 with precise timestamps and activity ordering, which aligns well with the ground truth's analysis of that case. However, it deducts points for incompleteness: it fails to address Case 1002 (where "Update_Inventory" is absent, directly challenging "always") and Case 1003 (where the order is again reversed, with an intervening activity). The ground truth comprehensively covers all cases, making the LLM's justification partially insufficient despite the short format requirement. No factual errors, but lack of full evidence coverage reduces the score under strict evaluation.
