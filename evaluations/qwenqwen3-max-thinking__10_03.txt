**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (positive, minor weight)**: Perfect use of the exact mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no synonyms or leaks. Matches ground truth and policy (+1.0 point baseline).
- **Activity identification and structure (major failure, -4.0)**:
  - Added unauthorized activities: "Approval (score > 70)", "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification" (4 extras vs. ground truth's precise 6: 4 mandated + "Compliance Officer Approval" + "Release Funds").
  - Renamed/mis-split: e.g., "Approval (score > 70)" ≠ "Compliance Officer Approval"; split "Release Funds" into two; added unmerged "Notification" and "Payment Scheduling" despite "do not rename, merge, or add".
  - 8 rows vs. 6; violates "covering **every activity and role**" without extras.
- **RACI assignments (major failure, -3.0)**: Near-total mismatch across ~80% of cells.
  | Activity | Matches | Key Errors |
  |----------|---------|------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Front: R (partial) | Misses Front A, CompA C, Treas I; Officer blank ≠ –; blanks ≠ –/specifics. |
  | KYC Review | CompA: R (partial) | Misses CompA A, Officer C, Treas I; Front blank ≠ –. |
  | AML Screening | CompA: R (partial) | Identical misses as KYC. |
  | Risk Scoring | CompA: R (partial) | Misses Front C, Officer A, Treas I. |
  | Others | None | All 4 rows fabricated/wrong. |
  - No "R, A" combos used; pervasive blanks ≠ – or specifics (e.g., no widespread C/I).
- **Formatting (minor failure, -0.5)**: Blanks ≠ –; no **bold** on activities/key cells; minor header/alignment diffs.
- **Overall fidelity**: ~20-25% cell-level similarity; ignores process nuances (e.g., escalations imply C/I; Treasury roles post-approval). Strict penalty for all deviations yields 2.0 total.
