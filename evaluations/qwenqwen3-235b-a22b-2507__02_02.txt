The LLM answer is factually precise and fully matches the ground truth across all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the exact sequence without deviations (no underscores needed, as per the original prompt's XML); Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line, with no extras, omissions, or errors. No hallucinations or minor discrepancies exist.
