The LLM answer matches the ground truth answer exactly for all three questions:

- Q1: Correct count of distinct cases ("3")
- Q2: Correct sequence for "C002" ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order")
- Q3: Correct, alphabetically ordered distinct activities immediately preceding "Ship_Order" ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock")

There are no deviations, extra, missing, or fabricated elements in the answer, and the format also matches expectations.
