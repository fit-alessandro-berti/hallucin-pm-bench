The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) matching the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3 without enabling or firing it. The explanation accurately describes the parallel paths and token placements, confirming the sequence's validity without factual errors. However, it omits the step-by-step markings (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}) and the detail on T5 disabling T3 post-firing, which adds precision in the ground truth; these omissions slightly reduce completeness under strict evaluation, though the core logic and brevity (under 120 words) are strong.
