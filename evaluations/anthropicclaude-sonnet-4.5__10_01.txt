2.5

The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without any forbidden terms, which aligns with the strict vocabulary policy and one key correctness criterion. It also maintains the correct single Responsible (R) per activity based on the process narrative and uses the same activities, roles, and columns without introducing extras.

However, under utmost strictness, the evaluation reveals substantial differences from the ground truth, warranting a low score due to numerous errors in RACI assignments and extraneous content:

- **Missing Accountable (A) assignments**: The ground truth explicitly assigns A (often combined with R as R/A on the Account Manager) for Receive Application, KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, and Notify Customer. The LLM omits all A's entirely, incorrectly treating the matrix as single-owner without accountability layering—this is a core failure in reflecting the narrative's implied ownership, affecting 5/6 activities. Even the LLM's legend and note mentioning A are unwarranted self-justification not present in the ground truth.
  
- **Incorrect Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments**: Multiple cells diverge significantly:
  - Receive Application: Compliance Officer is I (not C); IT Support is – (not I).
  - KYC Review: Account Manager is I (not A); Finance Clerk is – (not C); IT Support is – (not I).
  - Order Vetting: Compliance Officer is I (not C); Finance Clerk is – (not I); IT Support is – (not I).
  - Payment Clearance: Account Manager is I (not A); Compliance Officer is – (not C); IT Support is – (not I).
  - Record Update: Account Manager is I (not C); Compliance Officer is – (not I); Finance Clerk is I (not C)—all three non-R cells wrong.
  - Notify Customer: Compliance Officer is – (not I); IT Support is – (not I).
  This results in ~70% of non-R cells (12/18) being incorrect, under-assigning involvement and failing to reflect the ground truth's inferred consultations and notifications.

- **Unwarranted content**: The LLM adds a title, full legend, and note on accountability, which are not in the ground truth and introduce explanatory elements beyond the prompt's request for a strict RACI matrix. While not adding tasks/roles/columns, this violates the "no extra" criterion by expanding scope.

These errors compound: the R's provide a partial base (~20% alignment), but the absence of A's and pervasive C/I/– mismatches make the matrix functionally unreliable, with small discrepancies (e.g., I vs. C) treated as major losses per instructions. No self-awareness issues apply. A score above 3.0 would under-penalize the depth of deviations.
