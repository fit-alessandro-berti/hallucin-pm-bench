**8.0**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and well-structured, correctly identifying "yes" with the core enabling sequence (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5) that fires T5 without prior T3, matching the ground truth's prefix and explanation of the T2b shortcut bypassing pc. It provides a clear table, minimal length argument (correct lower bound of 4), and alternative orderings. 

However, strict evaluation reveals differences:
- **Sequence mismatch (major)**: Provides a 4-step sequence as "shortest" without firing T3, while ground truth provides (and deems shortest) the 6-step sequence including T6 → T3 to explicitly demonstrate T5 before T3 *with both firing*. This misses ground truth's full proof of post-T5 T3 enablement via feedback.
- **Table error (small but penalized strictly)**: After step 2 (post-T2b), incorrectly lists T2 as enabled (pa=0, so impossible).
- **Explanation variances**: LLM emphasizes "before any T3" (never firing it), ground truth shows T3 firing after; minor rephrasing (e.g., LLM's "first occurrence" vs. ground truth's direct arrow).

These reduce from 10.0: -1.5 for sequence/interpretation difference, -0.5 for table error. Overall very close (same path/logic), but not identical.
