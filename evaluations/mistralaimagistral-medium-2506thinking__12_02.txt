9.5

The LLM answer accurately identifies the two counter-examples (cases C003 and C005), with correct citation of line numbers and case-ids. The explanation is clear, precise, and directly addresses the evidence in the log. The only minor issue is a slight lack of conciseness: it redundantly repeats the logical conclusion and elaborates a bit more than necessary (“if the fact stated is always true...”), and the final box formatting (\boxed{No}) is not asked for and somewhat out of style for the task. These are extremely minor errors, but as per instructions, even small errors should incur a significant deduction, so the score is 9.5.
