The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time cannot be determined because no timestamps or duration data were provided. Although the phrasing could be slightly more detailed (matching the “intervals are absent” nuance in the ground truth), the fundamental information, logic, and conciseness are fully aligned with the instructions and the ground truth answer. No factual or logical errors are present; all relevant information from the artefacts was considered. Therefore, this is a perfect response.
