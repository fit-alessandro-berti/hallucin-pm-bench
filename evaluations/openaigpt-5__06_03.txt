The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets in the exact order they appear in Process B, with no extraneous information about other processes or tasks, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements. It matches the ground truth on core content but loses minor points for lacking the descriptive headers (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), the ‖ symbol for parallelism notation, backticks around task names, and the confirmatory final sentence—small formatting and completeness differences under strict evaluation.
