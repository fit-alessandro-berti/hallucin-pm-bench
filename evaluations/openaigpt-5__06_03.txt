The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, in the correct order, and with precise task names. It does not include extraneous information or reference Processes A or C, which matches the requirements.

However, it slightly under-specifies the answer compared to the ground truth: it omits labeling them as "Set 1"/"Set 2" or referencing the parallel block (e.g. "first parallel block"). In strict grading, these small differences (not labeling the sets clearly as sets or indicating which parallel block) result in a significant, though not severe, loss of points.
