7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Strengths (contributing to higher score):** The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint criteria of SLA breaches and high waiting times, with precise quantification of excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s respectively) directly grounded in the table data. Waiting times are accurately cited for each. The memo format is executive-style, ≈150 words, and uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations as instructed. No invented activities or metrics appear. The overall structure (header, intro, listings, recs, closing) aligns reasonably with the ground truth's intent.

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness):** 
  - **Headers differ substantially:** "To: COO" vs. "Chief Operating Officer"; "From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office"; added unnecessary "Date"; subject "Critical Performance Issues in Credit Process" omits "Loan-Origination" specificity and "April 2025 sample" context (–0.5).
  - **Introduction mismatches:** No mention of total cases (4,805, inferable from data summation), uses "excessive delays and SLA breaches" instead of "materially breach service targets while accumulating the largest queues" (–0.5).
  - **Activity presentation:** Numbered paragraphs for activities (with interpretive phrasing like "double its 300s SLA") vs. ground truth's bolded, integrated lines without numbering (minor but deducts for non-exact format, –0.5).
  - **Recommendations:** Bullet-point structure matches, but content is entirely different—LLM's are more general (e.g., "redeploy resources," "process redesign," "automate documentation") vs. ground truth's specific, prescriptive actions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks for bypass," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"). While both are concrete and data-tied (e.g., referencing times), the lack of alignment reduces fidelity (major deduction, –1.0).
  - **Closing:** Generic "improve overall cycle time and customer satisfaction" vs. ground truth's quantified projection ("reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35% and restore SLA compliance") omits data-derived impact (–0.5).

Overall, core analytical content matches closely (80% alignment), but strict differences in phrasing, structure details, and recommendation specificity warrant deductions, preventing a perfect score.
