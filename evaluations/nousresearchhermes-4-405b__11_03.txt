8.0

The LLM answer is very good and closely follows the provided data, ground truth, and instructions, with only minor deviations. Here is a strict breakdown of the issues and their penalty:

**Strengths:**
- It correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on both SLA breaches and high waiting times, exactly matching the ground truth.
- The memo quantifies by how much each activity exceeds its SLA, using the correct calculations: +300s for Legal Approval, +300s for Risk Review, and +60s for Credit Assessment.
- It references throughput and waiting time accurately, sticking to numbers from the data.
- It uses bullet points only for the recommendations, as instructed.
- It does not mention activities or metrics not in the table.

**Minor Errors or Differences (that must be penalized):**
1. **Action Specificity:** The LLM's recommendations are much more generic than those in the ground truth. E.g.,  
   - "Redeploy resources" and "target reducing wait time" (vague, not as concrete/data-driven as "rule-based pre-checks for low-risk files").
   - "Implement process redesign" and "halve throughput" (less specific than "add risk analyst" and "automate external score retrieval").
   - "Automate documentation handling" (less targetted than "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k").
   Penalty: -1.0 (since the recommendations lack the granularity and specificity given in the ground truth, which makes a large difference in executive settings).
2. **No explicit case/sample size:** The memo omits reporting the total number of cases analyzed (“4 805 completed cases”), which, while not a strict requirement, reduces transparency/grounds for recommendations versus the ground truth.
   Penalty: -0.3
3. **No mention of impact projection:** The ground truth memo includes a quantified projected impact (“reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35%...”), which is omitted.
   Penalty: -0.3
4. **Minor stylistic mismatches:** The opening and closing sentences are acceptable paraphrases but less data-grounded/formal than the ground truth. E.g., “will markedly improve overall cycle time and customer satisfaction” instead of “reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35% and restore SLA compliance.”
   Penalty: -0.4

**Final assessment:**  
Most importantly, the facts and identification of performance issues are correct and carefully grounded in the data. However, the recommendations are markedly less concrete, missing the actionable detail that distinguishes the ground truth. These deficits—combined—justify a significant but not drastic penalty.

**Total:** 8.0
