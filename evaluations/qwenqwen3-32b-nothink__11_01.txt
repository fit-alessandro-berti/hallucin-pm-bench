7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Full match—correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). Quotes average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5/120.0 hours, etc.). No mention of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities. (Full points here.)
- **Format and Constraints**: Structured as a crisp executive memo under 150 words (~120 words). Includes title, preparation note, and summary—appropriate for "executive memo," but adds minor unwarranted elements like "April 2025" date (not in prompt or data) and bold formatting, slightly deviating from ground truth's bare, concise list style.
- **Actions**: Concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues, each promising ≥20% reduction (via summary statement). However, not truly "data-driven"—lacks any data-backed justification (e.g., no pilots, estimates, or tests like ground truth's "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%"). Actions feel generic suggestions rather than evidence-based. This is a key prompt requirement, warranting a significant deduction (≈2.5 points off) for strictness on differences.
- **Overall Differences**: High fidelity on core facts (90% alignment), but action quality and minor stylistic additions create noticeable gaps from ground truth's terse, data-supported format. Strict scoring penalizes incomplete adherence to "data-driven."
