**2.0**

### Evaluation:
- **Q1 (40% weight)**: Factually incorrect. The exact string “Manual Fraud Check” appears **once** (CaseID 1002, 09:07:13Z). LLM wrongly claims "twice" and erroneously repeats "CaseID 1002 and 1002," miscounting the data. Ground truth: "1". Score: 0.0.
- **Q2 (60% weight)**: Superficial and generic ("small portion," "not representative," "outliers"). Ignores ground truth's key points: tiny sample (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), sampling error for rare events (frequency swings 0-7%, wide CI), near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) distorting strict/fuzzy matching. Fails analytical depth for process-mining analyst. ~70 words, compliant limit but low insight. Score: 3.3.

**Overall**: Major data error + shallow analysis = poor adherence to "strictly from data" instruction. Strict penalty applied.
