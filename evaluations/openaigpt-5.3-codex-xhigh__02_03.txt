**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, correctness, and conciseness. Minor formatting variations (e.g., bolding, backticks, phrasing like "Distinct cases: 3" vs. "3 cases", full question restatement in A2) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they align with the prompt's "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction and preserve all required information without deviation. All facts verified correct against the log.
