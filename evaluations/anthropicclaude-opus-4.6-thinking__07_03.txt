The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: three added tasks, one removed task, and two gateway type changes, matching the ground truth content exactly. However, under utmost strictness:

- Headings include unwanted **markdown bolding** (3 instances), absent in ground truth: -0.4 points.
- All task and gateway IDs have extraneous backticks (6 instances), not present in ground truth despite prompt examples using them stylistically: -0.2 points.
- Second gateway line lacks precise alignment spaces after ":" (ground truth has ~5 spaces for columnar alignment): -0.1 points.
- Minor colon spacing after backticked IDs is inconsistent with plain-text ground truth.

No other errors; output is otherwise verbatim-compliant, concise, and lacks commentary. Perfect content merits high score despite formatting deviations.
