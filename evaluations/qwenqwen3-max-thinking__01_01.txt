**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: Correctly identifies 3 core decision points (eligibility/triage, finance pre-approval, high-value threshold), matching GT's count. Documents list is **identical** (all 7 artefacts, correct conditional note on *AuditTrail*). No introductions of undefined activities/artefacts. Accurate sequence and interpretations (e.g., pre-approval not authorizing payment aligns with constraints).
- **Errors/Differences (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Decision points summary (major mismatch, -1.5)**: Different identification/structure/naming vs. GT. LLM: (1) Triage eligibility, (2) Finance pre-approve **as standalone decision**, (3) High-value check (untied to "after Finance"). GT: (1) Triage eligibility, (2) Amount **after Finance**, (3) **Final payment approval at Finance/Senior** (combines/emphasizes approvals explicitly). LLM misses explicit senior review decision and merges it implicitly; treats finance separately without GT's conceptual "final approval".
  - **Branching/outcomes detail (-0.3)**: LLM implies decisions but lacks GT's explicit "Eligible → continue; Not → rejected", "**> €1 000 → include; ≤ → skip**", "Approved → payment; Rejected → ends". Outcomes vaguer/shorter.
  - **Precision/location (-0.2)**: High-value not precisely "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**" (GT specifies); triage basis adds "*RefundRequestForm*" explicitly (process says "claim", minor stretch but not undefined).
  - **Format/structure (-0.3)**: Numbered prose list vs. GT's precise table (columns for logic/outcomes) + bulleted docs list. Less tabular/structured.
  - **Extra interpretive text (-0.2)**: Phrases like "confirms procedural compliance but does not yet authorize payment" accurate but not in GT (unnecessary elaboration).
  - **Completeness (-0.3)**: No equivalent to GT's footnote "(No other documents or legacy activities...)" reinforcing constraints.

Overall: Very close content-wise (no factual errors), but strict differences in summarization granularity, structure, and exact alignment deduct ~1.8 total. Perfect match would be 10.0.
