The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks by exact name, removed task by exact name, gateway type change by exact ID and types). It strictly follows the prompt's exact headings with • bullets and lists only those categories without speculation or extras. Ground truth adds IDs to task listings (not required by prompt), uses different formatting (**bold headings, *bullets, backticks, bold types, v1/v2 labels), and includes an unrequested final note. Semantic match is perfect; minor textual/presentation differences deduct 1.0 point under strict criteria.
