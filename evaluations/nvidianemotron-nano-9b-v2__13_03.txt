6.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Near-perfect match (correct count of 1, with accurate reference). Minor deduction for unnecessary elaboration (CaseID detail) not in ground truth's concise format, violating strictness on brevity/small errors. (9.5/10)
- **Question 2**: Partial match on core idea (small sample of 3 cases leading to misestimation), but significant deviations: Lacks ground truth's precise quantification (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours, 0-7% swing, confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events). Introduces speculation ("omit cases... not explicitly labeled") forbidden by system prompt ("no speculation"). Misses key data-driven points like specific near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and strict/fuzzy matching risks. Adds vague elements (e.g., "temporal distribution") without analytical depth. Word count compliant, but content quality suboptimal. (5.0/10 due to multiple substantive gaps and policy violation).
- **Overall**: Strong on factual accuracy but weak on analytical rigor, data fidelity, and adherence to no-speculation rule; strict scoring reflects unaddressed differences halving potential.
