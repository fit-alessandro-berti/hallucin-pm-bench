**9.0**

The LLM answer is semantically perfect: correct counts, correct preceding activity (Pack_Items for C456's Ship_Order), correct unique activity (Cancel_Order appears once). However, under utmost strictness:
- Missing "**Expected answer**" header (-0.5).
- Bullet markers (- vs *) and bold label styles differ substantially from **A1**/**A2**/**A3** (-0.3).
- Q1 omits "cases" after "3" (-0.1).
- Q2 label rephrases question with "before" vs "precedes" and extra descriptive text (-0.1).

Total deductions: 1.0 point. Format is concise bullets as prompted, but not an exact match.
