The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel, in the required alphabetical order both within pairs and overall, with one pair per line. The content matches the ground truth perfectly. However, under utmost strictness, there are minor formatting discrepancies: the use of non-breaking spaces (U+00A0) instead of regular spaces (U+0020), and likely insufficient spacing around the em dash (the specified format suggests double spaces before the dash, with the ground truth also showing column alignment via extra spaces in the second line, which is absent here). These small whitespace errors warrant a slight deduction despite the otherwise flawless response.
