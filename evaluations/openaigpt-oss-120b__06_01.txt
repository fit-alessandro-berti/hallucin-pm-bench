9.0

The LLM answer is correct in identifying both pairs of tasks from Process B that can be executed in parallel. Both pairs are listed, and the order of tasks within each pair is alphabetical. The overall order of pairs is also correct.

However, the response does not perfectly match the format provided in the ground truth:
- The spacing in the answer is tighter ("—" vs. "  —  " and so on). The ground truth uses double spaces around the em dash and aligns the pairs, whereas the LLM answer uses a single space with no alignment.

This formatting discrepancy, while small, is meaningful given the instruction to be strict and to let small errors reflect in significant point loss.

For this reason, the answer receives a 9.0 instead of a perfect 10.0.
