**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can execute in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in correct alphabetical order both within pairs and overall, and uses one pair per line. This matches the content and logic of the ground truth perfectly, including ignoring Process A and adhering to the description.

Minor deductions for formatting differences under utmost strictness:
- Lacks the ``` markdown code block present in ground truth.
- Second line lacks left-padding/alignment spaces (ground truth has ~5 spaces after "Procure_Materials" to vertically align the "—" with the first line in monospace).
- Potential extra trailing spaces on the first line ("Quality_Check  ").

These are small whitespace/presentation discrepancies, warranting a 1.0-point loss despite perfect substance. No content errors.
