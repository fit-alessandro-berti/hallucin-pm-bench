The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, calculations, and key concepts. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b are precise, with correct percentages and shown math. For Question 3, the response (68 words) addresses the single-occurrence issue ("only 1 case"), highlights variance/instability ("skew average cycle times", "insufficient representation"), and cautions against over-generalization ("risks distortion if generalized", "false causal inferences", "overfitting"). No errors or deviations; fully aligns with requirements.
