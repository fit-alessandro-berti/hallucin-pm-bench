7.0

The LLM answer is strictly correct in terms of content: all the added and removed tasks as well as gateway type changes are listed, and no extra commentary or unverifiable guesses are present.

However, there are several formatting flaws compared with the ground truth answer that, according to the instructions ("Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points") must be penalized:

- The bullet point format is missing. The ground truth uses "-" for each entry under the three headers, whereas the LLM simply presents each item on a new line.
- The output under each header is inconsistent: for GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, the ground truth indents the gateway ID and provides aligned formatting; the LLM omits dashes and does not align.
- The LLM omits indentation/spacing consistent with the ground truth.
- The formatting for tasks (id and name in parentheses) is present and accurate, but the missing dashes mean the output would not be strictly acceptable if copied as-is by a user needing to match the ground truth template.

Since every item is factually correct and there are no content errors, the response merits a score higher than middle-of-the-road. However, the instruction to be "utmost strict" and "small errors [...] significant loss" means missing the presentation format is a major penalty. Thus, a 7.0 is justified.
