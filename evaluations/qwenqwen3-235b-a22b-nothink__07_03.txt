The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (3), the removed task (1), and the two gateway changes, with precise IDs, names, and type notations matching the prompt and verifiable XML differences. No extra content or commentary is added. Minor deductions for lacking bullet dashes (-) before each list item (as in ground truth) and absence of alignment spacing in the second gateway line, which introduces small formatting inconsistencies under strict evaluation.
