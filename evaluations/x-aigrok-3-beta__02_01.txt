### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match (3 distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). No deduction.
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case A-9321). No deduction.
- **Q3**: Exact match (earliest timestamp is "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00"). No deduction.
- **Q4**: Exact match (2 occurrences of "Quality_Check": one for B-1045, one for C-77). No deduction.
- **Q5**: Partial match. The LLM correctly identifies "Pack_Items" and "Ship_Order" as activities that never appear as the first event, but omits "Validate_Order" (which also never starts a case). First events in the log are "Receive_Order" (for A-9321 and B-1045) and "Quality_Check" (for C-77), leaving "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", and "Ship_Order" as the complete list. This omission is a significant error per the strictness guideline, as Q5 requires a complete, accurate listâ€”deducting 3.0 points for incompleteness.

Overall, the response is strong in format (exact JSON schema) and correct on 4/5 questions, but the incomplete Q5 prevents a perfect score. Total: 7.0 (out of 10.0).
