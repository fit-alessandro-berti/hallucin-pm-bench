8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Part 1 (Accuracy)**: Perfect matchâ€”both identify exactly 1 occurrence. No deductions (10/10).
- **Part 2 (Explanation Quality and Fidelity to Ground Truth)**: The LLM response correctly highlights the small sample size (3 cases, short time window) and potential for misrepresentation as a limited excerpt, staying within 120 words (~85 words) and avoiding overt speculation. However, it misses critical ground truth elements: quantitative impact on frequency (e.g., 0% to 7% swing, wide confidence interval), extreme sampling error for rare events, and the confounding role of near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)") with strict vs. fuzzy matching distortions. These omissions reduce depth and specificity, warranting a deduction despite overall relevance (8/10). Total weighted score reflects strict criteria for alignment.
