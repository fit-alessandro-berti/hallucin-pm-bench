The LLM answer correctly identifies and enumerates all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names and comma separation, matching the ground truth content. However, it includes an unrequested introductory sentence, which deviates from the prompt's instruction to return the answer purely as numbered lines without additional text or explanation. This formatting error, though minor, warrants a deduction under the strict evaluation criteria.
