9.5

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth answer, especially in the "final answer" section, both in format and content:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

This matches the ground truth answer exactly.

However, the LLM output is docked 0.5 points for excessive and unnecessary verbosity preceding the answer. The instruction was to simply provide the numbered lines for the concurrent tasks, with no further commentary or paraphrase. The LLM includes several paragraphs of reasoning, process restatement, and meta-commentary, which—while logically correct and demonstrating full understanding—does not follow the spirit of the prompt, which emphasized strict adherence to the output format (numbered lines only, and nothing else).

If the LLM had output only the final three numbered lines, it would have received a 10.0. Therefore, the answer deserves a 9.5.
