**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part a) (Decision Points)**: Identifies exactly **two** decision points, matching ground truth. Rules are summarized accurately in one sentence each, with near-identical wording and logic (e.g., "Low or Medium AND ≤ €250,000" vs. ground truth's "Low or Medium *and* ... ≤ €250 000"; "at least two of three" matches "at least two of the three"). Minor deductions for: (1) stylistic naming ("Risk-Amount Branch" vs. "Risk-based skip"; added elaboration like "unanimous ... not required, but fewer than two blocks" slightly expands beyond one-sentence minimalism); (2) currency formatting (€250,000 with comma vs. exact prompt/ground truth €250 000 with space); (3) table format vs. ground truth's numbered list (presents same info but deviates in structure). No hallucinations or omissions. Score: 9.6/10.
- **Part b) (Documents)**: List is **identical** in content and order (9 items, including conditional Deck Memo, Signed Offer Sheet 77 as distinct). Extra accurate details (step column, conditional note) enhance without error, but strict interpretation of "List ... in the order they first appear" favors ground truth's minimalism—no extras needed. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML). Table format deviates from ground truth's plain numbered list. Score: 9.9/10.
- **Overall**: Exceptionally accurate (no factual errors/missing items), complete, and faithful to process description. Deductions only for minor stylistic/format diffs and currency punctuation (-0.3 total). Under utmost strictness, perfection requires exact phrasing, formatting, and zero extras/variations.
