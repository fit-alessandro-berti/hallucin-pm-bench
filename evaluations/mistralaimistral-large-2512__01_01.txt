### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**:
  - Identifies 3 decision points, matching ground truth count.
  - Decision 1 closely aligns: correctly ties to *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*, *FlightManifest*/*WeatherReport*, eligible → proceed/reject outcomes.
  - Decision 2 captures core high-value branch logic (> €1,000 → *Senior_Auditor_Review*; ≤ → direct to payment), referencing correct threshold and post-preapproval flow.
  - Documents list **perfect match** (all 7 exact artefacts, no extras/introductions; notes high-value for *AuditTrail* akin to ground truth "catalogue").
  - No legacy activity or undefined elements introduced.

- **Errors/Differences (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Misplacement of Decision 2** (-1.0): Labels as "(Finance_Controller_PreApprove)" vs. ground truth "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**" (process explicitly numbers branch post-step 3). Small but process-flow critical.
  - **Wrong Decision 3** (-1.5): Invents "Payment Authorization" decision at *Process_Refund_Payment* (checks *BankTransferAuthorization* presence → execute/wait). Process treats this as **precondition** ("once ... present"), not a branching decision point. Ground truth correctly infers "Final payment approval" at **preapprove/auditor** (possible reject → end). Introduces undocumented branching logic, violating "Do not introduce any activities or artefacts."
  - **Misses rejection risk** (-0.5): Ground truth explicitly notes approval/rejection at preapprove/auditor (per "succeeded" constraint); LLM assumes success, only rejects at triage.
  - **Format/Precision** (-0.5): Bullet-list vs. ground truth table (less structured/precise); verbose headers/outcomes vs. concise table cells. No final note excluding others (minor).

Overall: ~70% alignment (strong docs/logic, but 2/3 decisions flawed → non-perfect score). Strict policy penalizes all diffs proportionally.
