**1.0**

The provided LLM answer is a malformed, empty Markdown fragment with no table structure, no tasks, no RACI assignments, no mandated vocabulary (e.g., no "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"), and zero coverage of the source text steps. It fails every requirement of the prompt and matches nothing in the ground truth, which is a complete, accurate RACI table. This is a total failure warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
