The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the process description and ground truth. It adheres strictly to the prompt by focusing solely on Process B, numbering the sets sequentially, and providing no extraneous information about Processes A or C.  

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:  
- Formatting deviations (bulleted lists and "Parallel Split #X" headers vs. ground truth's inline `backticks` + ‖ notation and "Set X – [block name]" headers; these are stylistic but not semantically erroneous).  
- Omission of the explicit closing sentence "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel" (a completeness confirmation present in ground truth, though not explicitly required by the prompt).  

No factual errors, omissions, or additions; semantically equivalent and highly faithful under strict evaluation.
