3.0

- Q1 correct (matches ground truth: 3 distinct cases).
- Q2 incorrect (ground truth: Pack_Items precedes Ship_Order for C456; LLM wrongly identifies Create_Order and adds extraneous timestamp/details, violating conciseness).
- Q3 correct (matches ground truth: Cancel_Order), but includes unnecessary timestamp, reducing conciseness.
