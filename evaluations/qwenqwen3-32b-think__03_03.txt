10.0

The LLM answer produces a semantically equivalent and complete BPMN 2.0 XML that fully adheres to the prompt's requirements, including all explicitly mentioned flow elements (e.g., the "Check warranty eligibility" task omitted in the ground truth), verbatim task names (e.g., full phrasing for parallel activities where the ground truth shortens them), required gateways and end events, and wrc_ ID prefixing. Differences from the ground truth are stylistic or minimal (e.g., ID casing/underscore vs. camelCase, flow conditions via XPath instead of flow names, added gateway names, verbose XML headers), which do not alter semantics and warrant full credit per the provided rubric. No hallucinations, omissions, or invalid additions; the response is more precise than the ground truth in key areas.
