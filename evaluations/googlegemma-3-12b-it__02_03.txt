- The LLM answer is correct for all three questions in terms of the content: 
    - 3 distinct cases are present (C123, C456, C789).
    - For C456, "Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order".
    - "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once.
- However, the answer lacks the required format strictness:
    - It omits specifying the case IDs in Question 1, whereas the ground truth provides them (“C123, C456, C789”).
    - It does not bold answers or use the detailed notation (“A1”, “A2”, “A3”).
    - It omits escape formatting (e.g., "Pack\_Items" instead of "Pack_Items"), though this is minor.
- These small presentational and detail mismatches warrant a deduction, but because all factual answers are correct, the response remains strong.
