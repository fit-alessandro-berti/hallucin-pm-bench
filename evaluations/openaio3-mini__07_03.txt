7.5

- The LLM answer lists all required changes and does not include any elements that are unchanged.  
- However, it omits the bullet points ("-") before each task and gateway change, which were required as per the formatting shown in the ground truth.  
- The presentation of tasks also omits parentheses after the id, when per the instruction it should be "id (name)". The LLM does present "Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)," matching the ground truth format, so that's correct.
- The gateway changes are missing the bullet points and the alignment (extra spacing for ids), as in the ground truth.
- The order of elements under each heading is correct.
- There is no extra commentary or unchanged elements.

Errors are minor but present (notably the missing bullet points for each list item and incorrect heading formatting), per instruction, even small errors should cost significant points.
