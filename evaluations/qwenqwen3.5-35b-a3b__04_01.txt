7.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correct overall verdict ("Non-compliant")**: Full match (+2.0 base).
- **Identifies exact same violations (Rules 2 & 3)**: Matches ground truth on substance (+3.0).
- **Cites relevant rules with event references**: Accurate for violations (+2.0).
- **Penalties (strict deduction for differences)**:
  - Incomplete audit: Ignores Rules 1, 4, 5 (ground truth fully evaluates all 5 rules, confirming satisfactions; LLM assumes without stating, risking oversight) (-1.5).
  - Factual error in Rule 3: Claims "distance is 4" while listing only 3 intervening events (7,8,9); inconsistent and mismatches ground truth's precise "distance=3" (-0.8).
  - Less structured format: Lacks ground truth's comprehensive numbering per rule and summary conclusion (-0.3).
  - Minor phrasing: "Expedite_Flag (Event 4), which triggers..." accurate but less precise than ground truth's "Expedite_Flag is present (event 4), therefore..." (-0.2).

Total reflects high fidelity on core violations but strict penalties for incompleteness and small counting inconsistency.
