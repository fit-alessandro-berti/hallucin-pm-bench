The LLM answer is factually perfect and matches the ground truth in all content:

- **Q1/A1**: Identical ("3").
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"); escapes in ground truth are markdown artifacts, not content differences.
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, correctly alphabetized (A before C), no extras/missing. Minor formatting differences (no "-" or "<br>") do not affect factual precision per evaluation criteria. No hallucinations or errors.
