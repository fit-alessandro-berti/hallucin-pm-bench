8.5

### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Core Content Accuracy (Strength)**: The LLM correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B, listing the exact tasks in each ("Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability"; "Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing"; "Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware"). No incorrect tasks, no inclusion of sequential tasks, and no reference to Processes A or C. This matches the ground truth factually (9.5/10).
- **Format Compliance (Significant Deduction)**: The prompt specifies "Return your answer as numbered lines; in each line list the tasks...". The LLM adds an introductory sentence, bolding, and a concluding explanatory paragraph mentioning "P1, P2, and P3" and "no other tasks," which introduces extraneous content not requested. This deviates from the pure "numbered lines" format, violating the strict output instructions (major deduction: -1.0).
- **Minor Formatting Issues (Minor Deduction)**: Single spaces after commas in lists vs. apparent double spaces in ground truth (likely insignificant, but noted for strictness: -0.0, as it doesn't alter readability). No other small errors like typos or omissions.
- **Overall Strictness**: Factual match is perfect, but format deviation is a clear non-compliance, warranting a significant but not total loss. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply here.
