**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment vs. Ground Truth):
- **Vocabulary (perfect match, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Activities match exactly.
- **Structure/Formatting (partial, -1.0)**: Correct rows/columns/roles (no extras). However, uses abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) vs. full names; inconsistent bolding (e.g., all R/A bolded vs. selective); adds unwarranted intro text and full RACI key (not in GT); minor markdown diffs (e.g., column widths/spacing).
- **RACI Content (major failures, -5.0+)**: Extensive per-row/per-cell mismatches (utmost strictness applied; each diff = significant deduction):
  | Activity            | Key Diffs from GT                                                                 | Error Severity |
  |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
  | Receive Application | AM: A vs. **R/A**; CO: I vs. **C**                                               | High (missing R/A, wrong consult) |
  | KYC Review          | AM: I vs. **A**; FC: I vs. **C**                                                 | High (missing A/consult) |
  | Order Vetting       | AM: R vs. **R/A**; CO: I vs. **C**                                               | High (missing A/consult) |
  | Payment Clearance   | AM: I vs. **A**; CO: I vs. **C**                                                 | High (missing A/consult) |
  | Record Update       | AM: I vs. **C**; FC: I vs. **C**                                                 | High (missing consults) |
  | Notify Customer     | AM: R vs. **R/A**                                                                | Medium (missing A) |
  - GT pattern: Exactly 1 R/row (matches); AM accountable (A or R/A) across **all rows** (LLM misses in 4/6); multiple C's inferred from narrative (LLM uses excessive I's, ignoring consultations).
  - ~40% cells mismatch; violates "RACI allocations reflect the narrative" (GT's nuanced A/C vs. LLM's simplistic R/I-heavy).
- **Overall**: Terms/structure salvage minor credit, but core RACI (primary deliverable) has systemic errors (missing R/A combos, C's). No self-awareness issues. **Total: 2.0** (failure on strict GT fidelity).
