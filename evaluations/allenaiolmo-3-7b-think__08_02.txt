The LLM answer is factually correct (Yes, with valid minimal sequence T1→T2→T7→T4→T5 demonstrating T5 before T3), concise (under 120 words), and captures the key logic (P2 token persists via alternative path). However, strict deductions for: (1) missing post-transition markings (M₁–M₅) that ground truth uses to precisely verify reachability; (2) no explicit note on T5 consuming P2 (disabling T3), which ground truth includes for confirmation; (3) slightly mismatched structure (combines Q1/Q2 under "Question 1," adds unnecessary "(120 words)"); (4) less granular sequence presentation (arrows vs. numbered steps with markings). No factual errors, but omissions reduce completeness.
