9.0

**Justification:**
- **Q1:** Correct answer ("1 time"), with the supporting log line explicitly referenced. No deductions.
- **Q2:** Correct calculation and correct result (5.56%). No deductions.
- **Q3:** Correctly states "A1002". No deductions.
- **Q4:** Provides (a) limited time window—which is essentially "temporal bias"—and (b) small sample size; both are correct and grounded in the data. Slight deduction for small phrasing differences and the citation of "25%" (cases) rather than event percentages—but this does not rely on data not present. Also, "out of 4 cases" is constrained to given data.

**Overall:** The LLM answer is nearly perfect—fully correct in substance, with minor phrasing/precision variations and no inference beyond the data. Only a very small penalty for not referencing other possible biases such as "case mix" or "survivorship bias," though two correct rationales were required and provided. 

Hence: 9.0
