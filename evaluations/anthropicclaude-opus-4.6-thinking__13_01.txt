**10.0**

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth across all questions, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log data, or factual errors. Q1-Q3 are exact matches in content (minor phrasing/formatting variations like bolding, tables, or quoting the log line are enhancements, not deviations). Q4 provides two clearly stated reasons directly matching ground truth options ("Small sample size" and "Temporal bias"), with elaborations (e.g., confidence interval, variance examples) that align conceptually without introducing unsupported assumptions. All derivations are strictly from the 18 log lines (1 occurrence in A1002; 18 total events; 4 cases on one day). No point loss warranted, even under utmost strictness.
