**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment):** Identical three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), correctly justified as clear hotspots by table metrics (e.g., Request_Documents' 150 min wait/22% rework/5.5% SLA/190 throughput; Review_Documents' 25 min processing/9 stdev/12.4% SLA/185 throughput; Initial_Assessment's 18 min wait/3.2% SLA). Each has **one concrete, data-driven action** with measurable targets (e.g., rework <10%, stdev ≤4), tied directly to metrics. Strict table adherence (no absent activities, no guessing on differentiation). Concise memo format (<200 words), executive tone.
- **Minor differences/deductions (-0.8 total):** 
  - Explanations emphasize slightly different metrics (LLM omits Review_Documents' 30 min wait—second-highest, highlighted in ground truth; adds valid but interpretive "highest outside document steps" for Initial_Assessment SLA).
  - Actions concretely data-driven but diverge in specifics (e.g., LLM's standardization/upload vs. ground truth's digital requests/validation; routing/templates vs. AI/squad; capacity rebalance vs. triage engine).
  - No intro/closing projection (ground truth's 10% throughput/40% SLA lift adds polish, though not required).
- Overall: Excellent fulfillment of rubric with factual precision; differences stylistic/emphatic, not erroneous. Strict scoring reflects non-identical phrasing despite near-perfect match.
