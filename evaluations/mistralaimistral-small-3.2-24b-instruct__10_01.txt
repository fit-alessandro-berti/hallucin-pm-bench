6.0

- **Terminology:** The LLM strictly follows the vocabulary policy—**KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, and **Payment Clearance** are correctly used, and forbidden terms do NOT appear. Full marks for this aspect.
- **Matrix content (Major Issue):**  
    - The LLM gives only the **Responsible (R)** assignments, omitting **Accountable (A)**, **Consulted (C)**, and **Informed (I)** roles that are present in the ground truth.
    - The note claims “Accountable” is “implicit”, but the user requested a RACI, not merely R, so this omission is a major error.
    - "Consulted" and "Informed" assignments are omitted entirely, which is a significant deviation.
    - Every activity shows only a single “R”; there are no multiple roles per cell as in the ground truth (e.g., “R/A”).
- **Format:**  
    - The matrix format itself is fine and well structured, but the detail level is inadequate.
- **Extra notes:**  
    - The disclaimer about omitting C and I “for brevity” is not acceptable per the prompt.

**Despite correct terminology, failing to provide all the RACI assignments—especially Accountable, Consulted, and Informed—is a serious flaw and not a “small” one. This results in a heavy penalty.**  
Had those fields been supplied, the score would be much higher, but as-is, **the answer is incomplete (approx 60% correct): 6.0.**
