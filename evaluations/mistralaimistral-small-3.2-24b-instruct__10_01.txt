3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Adherence (Positive, +2.5 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere, including in notes. Activities match the process steps without extras or alterations.
- **Structure and Completeness (Major Deduction, -4.0 points)**: The matrix format is present (rows for activities, columns for roles), but it is severely incomplete. A full RACI matrix requires explicit R, A, C, and I assignments across all cells per row, as shown in the ground truth. The LLM only populates Responsible (R) entries (which are correct and match the narrative's "handled by/performed by" assignments), leaving all other cells blank. This omits critical details like Accountable (A) designations (e.g., ground truth shows AM as A in multiple rows, combined as R/A where AM is Responsible), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) roles (e.g., CO as C in Receive Application, FC as C in KYC Review). The notes attempt to justify omissions ("implicit A", "omitted for brevity"), but this adds unwarranted explanatory content not requested or present in the ground truth, and does not fulfill the prompt's expectation of a complete matrix. Headers include minor extras like (AM) abbreviations, differing slightly from ground truth.
- **RACI Allocations Accuracy (Partial Credit, +2.0 points)**: Responsible (R) assignments are 100% accurate and reflect the process narrative (one R per activity: AM for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Notify Customer; CO for KYC Review; FC for Payment Clearance; IT for Record Update). However, failure to show Accountable (A) explicitly (e.g., AM as A across appropriate activities) and all C/I interactions violates the ground truth's full representation, which infers logical cross-role dependencies from the process flow (e.g., CO consulted on Receive Application due to document handoff).
- **Unwarranted Content (Deduction, -1.0 point)**: The notes section introduces unrequested explanations about implicit roles and omissions, which are not in the ground truth and dilute the matrix's self-contained nature. No extra tasks or roles are added, but the brevity rationale is unjustified.
- **Overall Strictness**: Under utmost strictness, the partial matrix and added notes represent substantial deviations from the ground truth's comprehensive, no-frills table. While core Rs and terminology are flawless, the incompleteness (missing ~80% of cell content) and extras warrant a low-mid score. Small errors like header differences and note inclusion compound the loss.
