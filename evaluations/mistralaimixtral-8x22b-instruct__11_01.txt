### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (full marks, 10/10)**: Top 3 activities correctly identified and ranked by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). Both avg and 95p waiting times quoted verbatim from table. No mentions of service time, throughput, or other activities.
- **Format & Conciseness (9.5/10)**: Proper executive memo structure (To/From/Subject/Key Findings) fits "crisp executive memo" better than ground truth's bare list. ≤150 words (120 stated). Minor deduction for unnecessary "Impact" summary and word count footer, adding slight bloat.
- **Actions (8.8/10)**: Concrete, logically tied to waiting times, each claims ≥20% cut (30%+, 25%, 22%). Plausible and relevant, but significant differences from ground truth (e.g., reminders lack "pilot tests"/escalation details; closure letter uses templates/integration vs. e-signatures/batch; liability uses AI triage vs. rules-engine). LLM asserts % reductions without "data-driven" qualifiers like "pilot," "estimated," or "targeting," mildly violating "data-driven" and "without inventing unsupported data" (ground truth phrases cautiously).
- **No Unwarranted Content (10/10)**: Clean adherence.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Excellent match on core requirements (activities/numbers), polished delivery, but phrasing/structure/actions diverge notably from ground truth example (-0.8 total), warranting minor but significant deduction per instructions.
