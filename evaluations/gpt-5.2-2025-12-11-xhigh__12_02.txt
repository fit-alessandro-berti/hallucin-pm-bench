The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying both counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), using precise citations, and structuring as "No" followed by one justifying paragraph. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: lack of bullet-point formatting, explicit "clear counter-examples" phrasing, and concluding proof statement in ground truth; heavier bolding and semicolon structure instead of bullets; slight rephrasing (e.g., "occurs **before**" vs. "occurs first ... only afterwards"; "cannot be said to follow it" vs. "never contains ... at all"). These are small presentational variances under utmost strictness, warranting a slight point loss despite perfect accuracy and adherence to "one paragraph" instruction.
