The LLM answer correctly identifies the key factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, it incurs significant deductions for the following strict violations relative to the ground truth:

- **Task listings**: Uses only IDs (e.g., "check_vip") instead of the full names from XML attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). This omits explicit, factual name details, reducing completeness by ~20%.
- **Gateway phrasing**: Lacks version specificity ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)") and uses parentheses instead of explicit "changed from ... to", introducing minor but notable formatting and clarity discrepancies.
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Bullet styles (- vs. *) and absence of the closing note ("*(No other differences should be reported.)*") deviate from ground truth structure, though headings are mostly aligned.
- No speculation or extras, which is positive, but the incompleteness in XML-derived details (names) warrants a mid-range score rather than higher.
