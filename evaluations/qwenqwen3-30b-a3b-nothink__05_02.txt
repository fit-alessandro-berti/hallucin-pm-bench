2.0

The LLM's proposed improvement does not align with the ground truth, which is to reduce the due-date for "Collect Equipment" from 5 days to 2 days—an explicit, directly measurable SLA improvement. Instead, the LLM adds an `executionListener="onStart"` attribute to a `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>`, which is not a standard or meaningful property for BPMN 2.0 XML (and is not a documented Camunda extension for sequence flows). This change:
- Does NOT modify any due dates (the root cause of the SLA breach per the ground truth).
- Adds a technically dubious attribute with no effect in standard BPMN engines.
- Fails the requirement of making an “SLA-compliance improvement,” since there’s no evidence this would expedite the process or guarantee SLA adherence.

Further, the rationale provided is generic and not specific to the SLA breach described in the ground truth. The suggestion does not fulfill the rules (it does not select the correct attribute to change, and introduces something likely to be ignored by BPMN tools).

A minimal score above 1.0 is awarded because it does technically avoid adding or deleting activities, and attempts (albeit incorrectly) to work within the attribute/change constraints. However, the core problem is left unresolved, and the solution introduces a non-standard, ineffective modification.
