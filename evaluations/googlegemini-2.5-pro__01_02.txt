7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in structure and coverage, accurately identifying the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing all six required documents without introducing prohibited standard loan terminology. It uses exact activity names from the process description. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth deduct points significantly:

- **Decision Points (major alignment, minor precision loss: -1.5 points)**:
  - Underwriter Alignment Gate: Omits reference to "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and specific underwriter names ("Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B"). Paraphrases conditions as "2 points or less" (vs. exact "≤ 2") and "more than 2 points" (vs. concise "else"), and says "two independent risk scores" instead of naming them explicitly. This reduces fidelity to the process flow and terminology.
  - Amount Threshold Decision: Misses contextual placement ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") and exact outcome phrasing ("send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" vs. vague "forwarded to the next step"). Currency formatting is consistent (€15 000 vs. €15,000), but the lack of flow precision is an error.
  - Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA): Close match in essence, but uses italics for "*approve* or *reject*" (vs. bold "**Approve** or **Reject**") and adds redundant "for loans of €15,000 or more" (already covered in prior point). Introductory phrasing ("key decision points that determine an application's path") is extraneous and not in ground truth.
  - Overall: No extra or missing points, but paraphrasing and omissions make it less exact than the ground truth's structured, process-tied summary.

- **Required Documents (minor phrasing/ordering issues: -1.3 points)**:
  - All six documents are listed correctly and completely, with no additions or omissions.
  - Small errors: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" adds "old" (vs. "(≤ 3 months)"); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" inserts "single" and uses "or" (vs. concise "(pay-stub/tax slip)"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds "template" (vs. "(CIS)"). These deviate from the exact prompt/process wording.
  - Formatting: Bulleted list vs. ground truth's numbered list; lacks the ground truth's closing note on excluded standard documents (e.g., "No credit bureau report..."), which emphasizes the non-standard nature but isn't explicitly required—still, its absence reduces completeness.
  - No introduction of invalid terms, but phrasing inconsistencies count as errors.

The answer is polite and well-organized ("Of course. Here is a summary..."), but the prompt emphasizes exact terminology and flow adherence, so these cumulative small deviations (paraphrasing ~15-20% of content, minor word additions) warrant a deduction from a potential 10.0, landing at 7.2 for high overall accuracy with strict penalization.
