8.3

**Reasoning:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer uses the exact activity names from the process, as required.
- All three main decision points are clearly listed, using correct terminology.
- The required document list is complete and matches both content and explicit names in the ground truth, with consistent formatting.
- The answer avoids introducing standard loan terminology.

**Minor Errors:**
- The order of “Amount Threshold Decision” and its placement in the process flow is less precisely defined in the LLM answer. The answer doesn’t clarify that this decision happens *after* the Neighbourhood Feedback Check, which is explicit in the ground truth.
- The description for “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)” lacks the conditional phrase: that this step only applies to loans “amount ≥ €15,000, after NFC,” though contextually implied.
- The description under “Underwriter Alignment Gate” omits the explicit reference to “branch after the Dual Underwriter Split; else escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break, then continue.” The phrase “then continue” is present, but the nuance about where in the flow this occurs is not detailed.
- For required documents, one minor wording difference: “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” is used instead of just “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” as in the ground truth. However, this is a negligible variation.

**Conclusion:**  
Grading with strictness and taking small phrasing/placement deviations seriously, these minor imprecisions merit a notable but not drastic point deduction. The structure and substance correspond very closely to the ground truth, so the answer still earns a strong 8.3.
