### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures some core elements (e.g., start event, auto-classification task, first exclusive gateway for classification, diagnosis task, second gateway, forward-to-specialist to resolve, confirm task, end event, and the loop back to diagnosis) but deviates significantly from the ground truth and prompt in structure, completeness, and BPMN validity. Key differences, evaluated strictly:

- **Missing critical flow (major logic error, -3.0 points)**: No sequence flow from the "Provide Reset Instructions" task (t3) to "Confirm with Customer" (t7). The password reset path dead-ends, contradicting lines 3 and 7 (which imply resolution leads to confirmation). Ground truth explicitly includes f5: t2 → t6 for this.

- **Invalid exclusive gateway at gw2 (-2.0 points)**: Outgoing flows s6 (to resolve) and s7 (to forward) lack conditions or default, making the gateway non-deterministic and non-compliant with BPMN exclusive gateway semantics for decisions (line 5: "either 'Resolve Issue' or 'Forward to Specialist'"). Ground truth uses yes/no conditions (f7/f8).

- **Missing third exclusive gateway for confirmation (-2.5 points)**: The prompt specifies "two decision points" but requires modeling the re-work loop (line 9) as an exclusive decision after confirmation (if confirms → close; else → loop). LLM incorrectly uses direct conditional flows from the confirm task (t7 → t8 unconditional; t7 → t4 with condition), bypassing a required gateway for this decision point. Ground truth includes gw3 with yes/no flows (f12/f13). This violates "model the re-work loop exactly" and BPMN best practices for decisions.

- **Incomplete/inaccurate conditions (-1.0 point)**: gw1 condition uses a specific expression (`${ticketType == 'Password Reset'}`) instead of the simpler yes/no in ground truth (f3/f4). gw2 lacks any. Confirmation condition (`${!customerConfirmation}`) is invented and non-standard vs. ground truth's "no".

- **Naming and metadata mismatches (-0.5 point each, total -1.0)**: Task names differ slightly (e.g., "Classify Ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification"; no "Initial Diagnosis" actor note). Start/end unnamed (ground truth: "Ticket Submitted"/"Ticket Closed"). Process lacks name/isExecutable; extra unnecessary xmlns attributes bloat the XML beyond ground truth's concise style.

- **Minor XML structure issues (-0.5 point)**: No XML declaration (<?xml...>) as in ground truth. Target namespace and IDs differ but are concise. Total lines ~35 (compliant ≤40).

The model is partially functional for non-reset paths but fundamentally broken for reset and confirmation logic, hallucinating invalid flows/gateways while omitting required ones. No invented extras (e.g., no timers/SLAs), which avoids worse penalties, but strict adherence to "exactly as stated" and ground truth yields a low score. A perfect match would be 10.0; this is ~40% accurate in flow/logic.
