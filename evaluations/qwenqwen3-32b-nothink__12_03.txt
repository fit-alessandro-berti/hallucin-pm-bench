9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth answer:

- **Answer (“No”) is correct**, with a clear, direct justification.
- **Case-by-case analysis:**  
   - It correctly identifies the sequences for C001, C002, C003, and C004.
   - It spells out the violation in C002 and C004.
   - In C001 and C003, it points out that the immediate succession claim holds.

**Minor differences:**  
- The LLM answer does not format the analysis in a table, as the ground truth does; it is instead itemized in a bullet/list format.
- The LLM answer states that the sequence in C003 “supports the claim”—which could be more precise by explicitly stating that in C003 the immediate succession does occur.  
- Similarly, for C001, the answer says it is “consistent with the claim” rather than stating it occurs immediately after.

**Overall:**  
- No factual inaccuracies.
- All relevant cases and violations are cited.
- Slight loss of points for less precise phrasing and absence of explicit terminologies (“immediate successor,” “intervenes,” etc.) as in the ground truth.

Therefore, the score is **9.0**.
