**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision Points (major errors, ~40% match)**: LLM identifies 3 points but misplaces the high-value branch ("as part of Process_Refund_Payment initiation" vs. ground truth's correct "after Finance_Controller_PreApprove"). Fails to frame as "Amount threshold" post-PreApprove or include explicit "Final payment approval" at PreApprove/Auditor with rejection outcome. Triage and PreApprove decisions are partially aligned but lack precise phrasing/logic (e.g., no "claim rejected/returned"). No table format, introducing phrasing discrepancies. Significant loss for inaccuracy and incompleteness.
- **Required Documents (major incompleteness, 5/7 listed)**: Misses **FlightManifest** and **WeatherReport** (explicitly required for Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility). Lists others correctly but omits 2/7 core artefacts, violating "all required documents." Ground truth explicitly catalogues them, including conditional note on AuditTrail. No extras introduced, but omission is a critical failure.
- **Overall**: Factual errors (branch location), incompleteness (docs), and structural/precision differences yield low score under utmost strictness. Small mismatches (e.g., phrasing, no rejection paths fully mirrored) compound deductions.
