4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This evaluation is based on a strict, point-by-point comparison to the ground truth, penalizing omissions, additions, and deviations heavily (e.g., missing core elements like the scorecards deducts substantially, as does fabricating an invalid decision point). The LLM answer captures the overall structure but has critical flaws in completeness and accuracy.

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- **Ground Truth**: Identifies exactly 2 decision points: (1) the post-Tri-Color conditional skip (precise rule phrasing), (2) TriVote (emphasizes "at least two" approvals with exact approver names).
- **LLM Answer**: Lists 3 items, but only 2 are valid. 
  - Item 1 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) is incorrectly treated as a "decision point"; it's a procedural step producing an output (risk rating), not a gate/branch per the prompt's focus on "decision point (gate or conditional branch)." This is a fabrication/interpretation error (major deduction).
  - Item 2 correctly describes the conditional skip rule, closely matching ground truth phrasing (minor wording differences like "jumps past" vs. "bypasses" are negligible).
  - Item 3 partially matches TriVote but deviates slightly: says "any two... give their approval" vs. ground truth's "at least two... record 'Approve'" (ignores the process's initial "requires all three" nuance, though it implies the rule correctly; small deduction for imprecision).
  - The note on no other gates is accurate but doesn't offset the extra invalid point.
- **Scoring Impact**: ~50% accurate (1 fully correct, 1 partially, 1 invalid); loses points for extraneous content and minor phrasing issues. Partial credit for identifying the true decisions.

#### Part (b): Documents
- **Ground Truth**: Lists exactly 9 documents in first-appearance order, including the 3 scorecards as distinct inputs to step 3 (essential, as they are explicitly named "Inputs: Scorecard–Cyan, etc.").
- **LLM Answer**: Lists only 6 documents, omitting the 3 scorecards entirely (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow)—a critical omission, as they are required for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check and appear before the Deck Memo. 
  - The listed items (1-6) match ground truth order and content for the non-scorecard documents (e.g., treats Signed Offer Sheet 77 as separate, which is correct).
  - Claims "these are the only documents referenced," which is false due to the scorecard miss (hallucination of completeness).
  - No extraneous inventions (e.g., no KYC/AML, aligning with ground truth note), but incompleteness is a major fail.
- **Scoring Impact**: ~67% of documents covered (6/9), but missing the scorecards (first non-application documents) disrupts the "all documents... in order" requirement; severe deduction for incompleteness.

#### Overall
- Strengths: Good formatting (table/list), no hallucinations of external elements, core rules mostly grasped.
- Weaknesses: Major omissions (scorecards), invalid addition (extra decision point), and minor phrasing deviations compound under strict criteria.
- Final Adjustment: Balanced at 4.0 for partial fidelity, but strictness demands heavy penalty for ~33% content gap in (b) and interpretive error in (a). A perfect match would be 10.0; this is substantially deficient.
