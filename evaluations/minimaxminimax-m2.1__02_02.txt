**9.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict line-by-line comparison):
- **Q1/A1**: Exact match on core fact (**3** distinct cases: C001, C002, C003). Minor deduction for extra phrasing ("The distinct cases present are... Therefore...") not in ground truth's concise "**3**" (-0.2). No factual error.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact match on required sequence ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"). Extra bulleted list with timestamps is correct but unrequested (treat as extra element per instructions, -0.5). No factual error or fabrication.
- **Q3/A3**: Exact match on distinct activities, one per line, alphabetically ordered (**Arrange_Delivery** then **Check_Stock**). Extra per-case explanation is correct but unrequested and verbose (treat as extra/hallucination-like addition, -0.3). Format near-identical (one per line; minor diff in bold vs dash/<br>, negligible).

**Overall**: Factually perfect (no missing/fabricated elements, all precise to log). Losses only for extras/verbosity (-1.0 total). High score reflects strong alignment under utmost strictness; perfect format replication would be 10.0.
