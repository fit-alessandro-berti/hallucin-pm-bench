The LLM answer accurately identifies the correct response ("No") and provides a precise justification by citing the two counterexample cases (C002 and C004) with their exact sequences, directly addressing the task's requirements. It correctly explains the intervening activities, aligning with the ground truth's key violations. Minor deduction for not including the supporting cases (C001 and C003) or using a structured table, which makes the ground truth more exhaustive, though not strictly required for validity. No factual errors.
