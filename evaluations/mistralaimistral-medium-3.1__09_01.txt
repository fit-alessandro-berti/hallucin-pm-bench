**Score: 9.5**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth extremely closely, correctly stating that the average cycle time cannot be derived and providing a clear explanation. Both the LLM and ground truth answers explicitly point out the absence of any temporal/duration data as the reason, and both dismiss the historical benchmark as not usable for this calculation.

There is only a very slight difference in wording and a small extra emphasis on the “key limitation” in the LLM answer compared to the more concise ground truth. Nevertheless, the content, reasoning and factual assessment are all correct, and there are no fabricated numerical values. 

A minor deduction (0.5 points) is applied for slightly more elaborate wording and for paraphrasing (“redacted” versus “not present,” “ordering information” versus “elapsed times”), but there are no substantive or conceptual errors.

**Final: 9.5**
