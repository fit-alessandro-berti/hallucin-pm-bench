The LLM answer is an near-perfect match to the ground truth in substance, structure, and adherence to the system instructions. It correctly identifies that the value cannot be derived, provides a clear explanation focused on the absence of temporal data (timestamps/durations), and dismisses irrelevant elements like historical benchmarks without fabricating any metrics. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., bolding, numbering, and an extra "Key Limitation" section for emphasis) add clarity without introducing errors or deviations; the ground truth is more concise but equally valid. No factual inaccuracies or omissions impact the core response, warranting full marks even under strict evaluation.
