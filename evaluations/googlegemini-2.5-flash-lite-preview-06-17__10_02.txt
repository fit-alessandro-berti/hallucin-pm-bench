3.5

The LLM’s answer demonstrates several significant mistakes, which must be considered under strict criteria:

1. **Roles**:  
   - The LLM omits the **Operations Manager**, which is present in the ground truth. No justification is given.  
   - The LLM includes **KYC Review** as a column, confusing a process/activity with a role.  
   - The inclusion of **IT Support** only as a participant within process steps for “SWIFT message” and “Archive” tasks (in the ground truth), but it is not shown in the LLM's table header at all.  
   - “Regulatory Liaison” and “Transaction Analyst” are present, as required.

2. **Activities**:
   - The LLM merges or splits process steps incorrectly:  
     - “Perform KYC Review” is correct in wording but is placed as a row and a column header (the latter is erroneous).  
     - “Notify Regulatory Liaison” is not part of the informal description and is therefore irrelevant.  
     - Tasks are not properly mapped to the enforced vocabulary in every step.

3. **Role/Activity Mix-up**:  
   - The LLM treats “KYC Review” as a role (column), when it should only ever be an activity.  
   - There is no step “Notify Regulatory Liaison” in the original process; the LLM invented process steps.

4. **Responsibility Assignment**:  
   - The RACI assignments rarely match those of the ground truth, indicating a weak understanding of who is "responsible" or "accountable" for each.

5. **Mandated Vocabulary**:  
   - While the LLM avoids forbidden synonyms, it partially dilutes accuracy by inventing tasks and assigning improper roles to activities (see above).

6. **Structure**:  
   - The table structure is muddled: columns and rows mix roles and activities, while some roles are improperly represented.

Because of these faults—particularly the role confusion, omission and invention of steps, improper RACI allocation, and structure—I must assign a strict score of **3.5**.  
The LLM used the mandated synonyms and avoided forbidden terms, but that alone does not compensate for structural misunderstandings and inaccuracies in both RACI mapping and process breakdown.
