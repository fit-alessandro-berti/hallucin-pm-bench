The LLM answer deviates fundamentally from the ground truth in structure, content, and adherence to the prompt's requirements, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Incorrect table structure**: The LLM treats "KYC Review" (an activity) as a column header alongside roles, inverting the RACI format where rows should be tasks and columns roles. The ground truth correctly uses tasks as rows (e.g., "**KYC Review**") and roles as columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support).

- **Omission of required roles**: The LLM excludes "IT Support" and "Operations Manager" (present in the ground truth and implied by source coverage), failing to cover all entities from the informal description (e.g., IT Support's roles in sending SWIFT messages and archiving).

- **Incomplete or mismatched task coverage**: The LLM has 8 rows with non-mandated or altered wording (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; added "Notify Regulatory Liaison" row not in ground truth). It splits steps inaccurately (e.g., separate rows for KYC and approval) and omits precise mapping to source tasks like archiving the "case file" (ground truth uses "Archive Record").

- **Erroneous RACI assignments**: All assignments differ significantly from the ground truth. For example:
  - "Receive Payment Instruction": LLM has R for Transaction Analyst but adds incorrect I/A/I; ground truth specifies R/A for Transaction Analyst/Operations Manager.
  - "**KYC Review**": LLM assigns R to KYC Review (itself, nonsensically) and A to Regulatory Liaison; ground truth has R for Regulatory Liaison and A for Operations Manager.
  - No alignment for high-risk approval, payment release, or archiving (e.g., LLM's archiving row ignores IT Support's R in ground truth).
  - Source step 2 (screening) mismatches: LLM has R for Transaction Analyst; ground truth has R/A for Transaction Analyst/Regulatory Liaison.

- **Vocabulary and formatting violations**: While the LLM uses some mandated terms (e.g., "KYC Review," "Transaction Analyst," "Regulatory Liaison"), it applies them inconsistently (e.g., KYC Review as a role). No bolding on key terms like in ground truth, no legend, and extraneous intro text not matching ground truth's clean table-plus-legend-plus-notes format. The LLM fails to "organise the RACI matrix clearly" per the prompt and does not explicitly note mapping every step without omissions.

These are not minor errors but systemic failures in interpreting the RACI format, covering the source text, and mirroring the ground truth's precise output, resulting in zero effective alignment.
