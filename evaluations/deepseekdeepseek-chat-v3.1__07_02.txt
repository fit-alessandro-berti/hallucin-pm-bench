The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, but it loses 1 point for the following issues:

- The phrase “Task_FinalReject ... has been added, replacing the previous Task_RejectLoan” is not strictly correct. It should be stated only as an added task; “replacing” is interpretive (and hints at a relationship that is not explicit in the process-mining assignment, which should just list added/removed tasks).
- The LLM mentions the gateway name change (“Eligible?” to “Eligibility Check”) in the Gateway-type changes section, even though the prompt says to **ignore cosmetic renaming**, and the ground truth does not reference this.

Otherwise, the detection and grouping are accurate and fully complete. These small interpretive/cosmetic “oversteps” warrant a 1-point deduction for strictness, as requested.
