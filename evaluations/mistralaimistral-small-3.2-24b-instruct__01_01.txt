4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but introduces significant inaccuracies and expansions in the decision points section, violating the prompt's instruction to avoid introducing undefined elements. The documents list matches closely, providing some credit, but the overall strict assessment penalizes deviations heavily.

#### Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)
- **Documents List**: Identical to ground truth in content (all 7 items listed correctly, including conditional note for *AuditTrail* implied though not explicitly stated). No extras introduced. This section is ~10/10 accurate.
- Structure: Clear organization with headings, mirroring the ground truth's separation of decision points and documents.

#### Weaknesses (Driving Score Down)
- **Decision Points**: Major deviations, with ~50% accuracy but critical errors:
  - Lists 5 points vs. ground truth's 3, over-expanding the process (e.g., treating *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* and *Senior_Auditor_Review* as separate rejection decisions, when ground truth combines them into one "Final payment approval").
  - Placement mismatch: High-value check is correctly identified but framed as a standalone "branch check" post-pre-approval, aligning with ground truth #2 but inflating it unnecessarily.
  - Introduces undefined elements: The fifth point (*Process_Refund_Payment* decision on *BankTransferAuthorization*) is not a "decision point" in the process description—it's a prerequisite condition, not a branching outcome like "halts" or triggering the letter. This fabricates behavior (e.g., explicit "process halts" or direct letter trigger), directly against "Do not introduce any activities or artefacts that are not defined above." Ground truth omits this entirely, focusing only on explicit/inferred decisions.
  - Assumes unstated rejections/endings at multiple steps (e.g., in triage and finance), which go beyond the process description's linear flow and high-value branch. Ground truth is more concise and tied to defined steps without speculation.
  - Format: Numbered list with explicit "Decision/Outcome" is interpretive but diverges from ground truth's tabular, neutral summary style, adding interpretive phrasing (e.g., "claim rejected/returned") not in the source.
- **Strictness Impact**: Even minor additions (e.g., extra outcomes) count as "small errors" warranting significant deduction (~ -2 to -3 points per instance). The invented payment decision alone justifies a ~ -3 point hit for introducing undefined process logic. No mention of the legacy activity constraint, though neither introduces it.

Overall, the answer is useful but not faithful—documents salvage it from <4.0, but decision points' inflation and invention cap it at 4.5. A perfect match would require exactly 3 points, no extras, and verbatim alignment.
