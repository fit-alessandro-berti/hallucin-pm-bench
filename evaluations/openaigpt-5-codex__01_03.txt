### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and faithful to the process description, with no hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML elements) and correct identification of the two decision points and all nine documents in precise first-appearance order. However, under strict evaluation, minor wording discrepancies in part (a) warrant a deduction:

- **Decision point 1**: The summary correctly captures the conditional rule (Low/Medium risk AND ≤ €250 000 to skip step 5) but abbreviates "Manual-Underwriting-Review" to "Manual Underwriting" (a small but imprecise truncation of the exact term) and uses "Post–Tri-Color Risk Check branch" instead of aligning closely with the ground truth's "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check" phrasing. The core rule is unchanged, but this reflects slight deviation in terminology.
- **Decision point 2**: The rule is correctly summarized as requiring at least two approvals, but phrasing like "at least any two" is redundant and less precise than the ground truth's "at least two ... record 'Approve.'" Additionally, "gatekeepers" is a minor interpretive liberty versus the exact roles listed ("approvers" in ground truth); the process specifies "approvals," so this edges toward loose paraphrasing.
- **Part (b)**: Perfect match—no errors in list, order, or completeness. Header is functionally equivalent ("Documents in order of first appearance" vs. "Required documents (first-appearance order)").

These are small semantic and stylistic differences, not substantive errors, but per instructions, they result in a significant point loss from a potential 10.0 (e.g., deducting 0.8 total for imprecision in rule descriptions). The answer fully addresses the prompt without omissions or additions.
