9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed task, and gateway type changes) with precise IDs, names, and type transitions matching the ground truth content and prompt specifications. No extraneous commentary or unchanged elements are included. However, under utmost strictness, minor formatting discrepancies result in a deduction: the ground truth uses bullet points ("- ") for each item and column alignment (spaces after "Gateway_Payment:") to structure the lists, while the LLM answer omits these, listing items plainly on new lines. This constitutes small presentational errors, warranting a 1.0-point loss from a perfect score.
