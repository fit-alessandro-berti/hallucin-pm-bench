The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms without synonyms or leaks, which is a minor strength. However, it severely violates the prompt by adding unauthorized activities ("Approval", "Schedule Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst") not explicitly described as distinct steps in the narrative, while failing to exactly match the ground truth's activities (e.g., no "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Release Funds" is present but contextually incomplete). RACI assignments are inaccurate and incomplete across all rows: missing combined roles (e.g., no "R, A"), omitted involvements (e.g., no "I" for Treasury Ops in early activities; no "C" for Compliance Officer in KYC/AML), and incorrect designations (e.g., Risk Scoring only assigns "Responsible" to Compliance Analyst, ignoring "A" for Officer and "C" for Front-Office). The table header and formatting deviate slightly (e.g., no bolding, "Activity / Role" vs. "Activity"), and it expands beyond the narrative's scope without merging or precisely covering "every activity." These multiple, significant errors—especially additions and mismatches—warrant a very low score under strict evaluation criteria.
