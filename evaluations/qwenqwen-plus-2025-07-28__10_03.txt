3.0

The LLM answer makes a visible effort to adhere to the authorized vocabulary policy, using "Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," and "Risk Scoring" as required (no disallowed synonyms appear).

However, there are several significant and strict errors compared to the ground truth:

- The activities are not faithfully reproduced from the ground truth: the LLM invents/merges tasks not present in the ground truth ("Approval", "Schedule Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst") instead of using "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". This violates the instruction not to add or merge activities.
- The RACI assignments differ from the ground truth (for example, "Compliance Officer" as A for "Risk Scoring" is missing, R and A are not always properly assigned for the same role/activity, and "C" and "I" assignments are misapplied or omitted throughout).
- The notation does not use the "R, A", ".", or "â€“" syntax as shown in the ground truth answer.
- The presence of extra or merged activities ("Approval", "Schedule Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst") replaces separately listed required activities, even though the user specifically requested no merging or renaming.
- "Accountable" and "Responsible" assignments do not always follow the pattern from the ground truth.

Positives:
- All four required vocabulary items are faithfully used and no disallowed terms appear.
- The matrix is presented as a Markdown table.

Negatives are severe: incorrect activities, missed/incorrect assignments, deviations in structure, and not following required output conventions.

Therefore, the answer barely avoids a failing grade due to vocabulary compliance, but significant errors in activity representation, role assignment, and notation force a harsh 3.0 (strict grading context).
