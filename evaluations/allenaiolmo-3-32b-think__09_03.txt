The LLM answer is highly accurate and adheres closely to the task requirements: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to lacking data rows and timestamps in Artefact A, explains precisely in one short paragraph without guessing or external knowledge, and covers all metrics (average, std dev, CI). Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., not explicitly noting "redacted" rows/timestamps or naming start_time/complete_time columns, omitting suggestion of needed raw entries, using "duration" instead of "cycle time"), but these are small and do not alter the core correctness.
