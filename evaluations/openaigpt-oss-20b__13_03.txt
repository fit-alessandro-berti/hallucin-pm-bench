8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Count)**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence, including case/timestamp detail aligns). Full points here.
- **Part 2 (Explanation)**: Strong overlap in core ideas (tiny sample of 3 cases/one day leads to unreliable ratio estimation; risks from exact string matching vs. variations). Word count compliant (≈85 words). However, strict deduction for deviations: lacks ground truth's precise quantification (14 events, <2 hours, 0%-7% swing, confidence interval, sampling error for rare events); misses specific in-log near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”); adds ungrounded speculation (e.g., “multiple manual checks per case”, invented phrasing like “Manual Review of Fraud” not in data). These reduce fidelity, per utmost strictness. Overall, 85% alignment warrants 8.5.
