**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high base)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities as ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), prioritized similarly by key metrics (wait, throughput drop, processing time, rework, SLA breaches). Explanations are strictly table-based, citing precise figures (e.g., 150 min wait, 22% rework, 25 min processing, 12.4% SLA) without hallucination or external activities. Concise (~160 words <200 limit). Data-driven ties to underperformance.
- **Penalties (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Actions violate "one concrete" rule (-1.5)**: Each "action" compounds 2+ ideas (e.g., Request: capacity/automate *and* standardize templates; Review: checklist/training *and* prioritize; Initial: rebalance *and* streamline). Ground truth delivers singular, focused actions (e.g., "Launch automatic..."; "Introduce AI-assisted...").
  - **Format/structure mismatch (-0.2)**: Lacks executive memo header/title (ground truth: "**Executive Memo – Claims Handling Q1-2025**"), numbered list, bolded metrics for emphasis, and wrap-up synthesis. Feels like bullet notes vs. polished memo.
  - **Minor phrasing/inference issues (-0.1)**: "Throughput drop vs. 270 prior" accurate but less precise than ground truth's absolute "drops to 190"; casual causal claims (e.g., "driving 5.5% SLA breaches") slightly interpretive.
- **Overall**: Excellent content alignment (90% match), but strict rubric penalties for action plurality and polish drop it below 9.0. No major errors, but small ones cost dearly per instructions.
