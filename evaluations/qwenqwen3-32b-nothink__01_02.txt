3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points Section (Major Errors, ~60% Weight)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)), focusing strictly on branching/decision logic in the process flow. The LLM incorrectly includes 2 additional non-decision steps (Quick KYC Verification and Community Impact Assessment) as "decision points," which are linear verifications/assessments without branches. This introduces extraneous content, violating the prompt's call to summarize only decision points using exact terminology. The 3 correct points are described accurately in substance (e.g., score difference ≤2, amount thresholds, board vote), but the inclusion of extras and altered structure (5 items vs. 3) significantly deviates. Minor phrasing (e.g., "**> 2 points**" vs. ground truth's "differ by ≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate") adds slight inaccuracy. Under strict criteria, this warrants a severe deduction for misidentifying core elements.
  
- **Required Documents Section (Minor Errors, ~40% Weight)**: The list is complete and matches all 6 items from the ground truth/prompt. However, small wording differences penalize under strictness: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (unnecessary "single" and "or"); "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (added "template"); bullet vs. numbered format; missing the ground truth's explanatory note ("No credit bureau report..."). These are not egregious but reflect in point loss as instructed.

Overall, the response is partially accurate but undermined by fundamental misinterpretation of "decision points," leading to a low score despite strong document fidelity.
