6.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- All required documents are correctly listed by exact name, no extras or omissions.
- The LLM uses the activity names from the process (“Quick KYC Verification”, “Underwriter Alignment Gate”, etc.).
- Amount threshold and board approval logic is mainly correct.

**Major Issues (point deductions):**
- **Decision Points:** The answer wrongly includes “Quick KYC Verification (KYC)” and “Community Impact Assessment (CIA)” as decision points. The ground truth identifies only *three* critical decision points where the application's outcome is in question. KYC and CIA are process steps, not gates where an approve/reject/escalate decision is made.
    - This is a major logic and comprehension error, as the prompt asks specifically for "decision points," not process steps.
    - This should deduct at least 2 points.
- **Order and Structure:** The placement of “Underwriter Alignment Gate” is not explicitly said to be after the “Dual Underwriter Split,” and the logical flow may confuse strong process readers.
    - This should deduct at least 1 point.
- **Precision:** The wording for when “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)” occurs is correct, but the structure is confusing as it is mixed into the final amount threshold bullet.
- **Lack of full clarity on branch:** The answer fails to clarify that the “Underwriter Alignment Gate” is specifically the branch *after* the risk scoring. Also, it does not use the full branching logic or use strict phrasing as in the ground truth.
- **Document List Formatting:** “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” is not exactly correct in title compared to “Community Impact Statement (CIS).” Might be nitpicky, but for utmost strictness, a small deduction for minor labeling in one document (template vs. CIS) is warranted.

**Minor Errors (further fractional deduction):**
- For utmost strictness, any deviation from precise titles, sequencing, or the inclusion of non-decision steps must be penalized.

**Summary:**  
This is a strong recall of facts but contains both structural and interpretive errors regarding which activities are *decision points* versus process steps. The document list is 99% correct, minus the “template” nitpick. This submission notably blurs process and decision concepts, which is significant for utmost strictness.

Final: **6.0/10.0**
