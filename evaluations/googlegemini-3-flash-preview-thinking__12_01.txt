The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate, and provides evidence-based justification citing all relevant cases (1001, 1002, 1003) with precise timestamps and activities matching the log. Minor deductions for: (1) phrasing case 1002 as "inapplicable" rather than explicitly "disproves 'always'" (as in ground truth); (2) using timestamps instead of line numbers; (3) slight structural differences (no "Short verdict"/"Justification" headers); (4) extraneous mention of "Quality_Check" (accurate but not in ground truth). These are small differences but warrant deduction under utmost strictness.
