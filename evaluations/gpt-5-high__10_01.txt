5.0

The LLM answer strictly follows the vocabulary policy ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance", with exact spelling/capitalization; forbidden terms do not appear). The activities and roles are mapped accurately from the process, and no extraneous tasks or roles are added.

However, there are significant differences and shortcomings versus the ground truth:

- **RACI granularity**: The LLM answer only uses "A/R" (seemingly meaning Accountable AND Responsible) and omits "C" (Consulted) and "I" (Informed) assignments present in the ground truth. In the ground truth, several activities mark non-principal roles as "Consulted" or "Informed," which are missing from the LLM answer.
- **Matrix completeness**: The LLM answer leaves many cells blank ("-"), where the ground truth assigns "C" or "I".
- **Formatting**: The LLM uses CSV notation rather than the Markdown table format shown in the ground truthâ€”minor, but it reflects less adherence to format expectations.
- **Lack of detail**: The combination "A/R" appears for several assignments, which could be interpreted the same as "R/A" in the ground truth, but it's ambiguous whether the distinction is intentional or not; however, this is a minor point compared to missing consult/inform assignments.

Therefore, while terminology policy is met and overall activity mapping is essentially correct, the neglect of complete RACI allocations and the omission of many role involvements make this answer substantially less complete and accurate than the ground truth. Significant points are lost for these reasons, meriting a mid-level score.
