3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology (2.5/3.0)**: Correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. Minor deduction for not bolding them as in ground truth (though not explicitly required, it aligns with emphasis in notes).
- **Format and Structure (1.0/3.0)**: Provides a basic CSV-like list with a legend, which conveys rows/columns but lacks proper table formatting (e.g., no markdown table as in ground truth). Dashes imply non-involvement, but this oversimplifies and doesn't match the multi-role assignments expected in a full RACI matrix. No unwarranted extras (e.g., no new tasks/roles), but the presentation is crude and non-standard.
- **Correctness of RACI Assignments (0/4.0)**: Major failures here, leading to near-total loss. 
  - Each activity has exactly one "Responsible" (inferred from the sole A/R assignment), but this is superficialâ€”assignments do not reflect the narrative or ground truth.
  - Combines A/R incorrectly: e.g., "KYC Review" assigns A/R to CO (wrong; ground truth has R on CO, A on AM); "Payment Clearance" assigns A/R to FC (wrong; R on FC, A on AM); "Record Update" assigns A/R to IT (wrong; only R on IT, no A specified, with C on AM/FC).
  - Completely omits Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles across all activities, which are explicitly present in ground truth (e.g., CO as C in "Receive Application"; FC as C in "KYC Review"). This ignores logical workflow interdependencies implied by the process description (e.g., documents arriving for CO after AM receives).
  - Only partially matches where AM is R/A ("Receive Application", "Order Vetting", "Notify Customer"), but even these are incomplete without C/I for others.
  - Overall, the matrix is a skeletal outline focused only on the primary handler, missing the collaborative aspects central to RACI.
- **Overall Adherence and Strictness Penalty**: The response adheres to no extra content but fundamentally misinterprets RACI by under-assigning roles, violating the "reflect the narrative" expectation. Small errors (e.g., A/R notation vs. separate R/A) compound into systemic inaccuracy. Under utmost strictness, this is a low-quality, incomplete output warranting significant deduction.
