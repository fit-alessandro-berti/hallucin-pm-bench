**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Wrong identification of worst activities (major violation, -4.0)**: Correct top two (Legal Approval +300s breach, 600s wait; Risk Review +300s, 480s) but third is Fund Disbursement (no breach: 60s < 120s SLA; wait only 50s, not high). Ground truth correctly picks Credit Assessment (+60s, 200s wait). Joint metric ignores data.
- **Invented/erroneous metrics (major, -2.0)**: Fabricates % adherence rates (-60%, etc.); misstates Fund wait as "600 seconds"; "SLA set-off" unclear/nonsense. Prompt forbids inventing metrics.
- **Format violations (major, -1.0)**: Outputs Python code instead of "**only** the memo text." Memo lacks proper structure (no To/From/Subject). Recommendations not "**bullet points only**" (has intro text, bolding, trailing summary).
- **Non-data-driven recommendations (major, -0.5)**: Generic/invented (e.g., "AI-Human Collaboration Tech," "staff augmentation") vs. ground truth's concrete, process-specific actions. Not grounded in data/cases.
- **Minor issues (-0.5)**: Word count ~250+code (exceeds ~150); unnecessary calculations printed; minor phrasing errors (e.g., "slavic_adherence_rate" typo in code).

Total deductions yield 2.0; partial credit for top two activities and breach quantification only.
