The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of computation due to insufficient data but loses significant points for vagueness, lack of precision (e.g., fails to explicitly reference Artefact A’s headers-only structure, redacted rows/timestamps, or the specific need for start_time/complete_time for “Approve Invoice” cycle time), and a factual inaccuracy (“only the "Approve Invoice" activity is present,” unsubstantiated by the redacted stub). It also does not mirror the ground truth’s concise, targeted structure or exact phrasing for std dev (“dispersion”) and CI, diluting adherence to the “precisely why” requirement.
