The LLM answer correctly identifies statuses for R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6, and the overall result, with justifications mostly concise and under 20 words. However, R2 is critically incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated), as it fails to account for the Change_Request requiring a new approval, making the initial Finance_Approval not the final oneâ€”Ship_Goods precedes the required new Manager_Approval by more than 2 days, violating the expedited rule. This core analytical error, central to rules R2 and R5 interplay, warrants major deduction under strict criteria. R5 justification is also slightly incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice before new approval).
