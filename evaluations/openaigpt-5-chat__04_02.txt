6.0

R1: Correctly marked as "Compliant" with a suitable justification.

R2: Marked as "Compliant," which is incorrect. The rule is actually violatedâ€”the LLM didn't re-examine approval order after the Change_Request. This is a major error.

R3: Correctly marked as "Violated" with a concise correct justification.

R4: Correctly "Not Applicable" and justified.

R5: Correctly marked as "Violated" with a reasonable explanation.

R6: Correctly identified as "Compliant."

Overall result is "NON-COMPLIANT," which is correct, but one of the three violations (R2) is missed.

Major error in R2 assessment (should be "Violated," not "Compliant") results in substantial point loss as it affects both per-rule analysis and overall confidence in the answer. Justifications are otherwise concise and mostly accurate, matching ground truth. Small errors in wording, but the main fault is R2's misclassification.

Final score: **6.0**.
