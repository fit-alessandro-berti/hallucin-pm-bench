**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: Correctly identifies 1 occurrence in C05. +3.4/3.4
- **Q2a (perfect match)**: Exact 2.08% (1/48), properly calculated and rounded. +3.3/3.3
- **Q2b (perfect match)**: Exact 8.33% (1/12), properly calculated and rounded. +3.3/3.3
- **Q3 (partial, -significant deduction for strict criteria)**: ≤100 words (92). Covers (iii) over-generalization well ("generalize from this slice", "not applicable to entire process"). Implies (i) single-occurrence via "low frequency"/"low-support" + prior context, but does not explicitly mention "single occurrence"/"once"/"lone case" *in the explanation*. **Fully misses (ii)** variance/instability (no reference to noise, skewing averages, single-observation unreliability, wide CIs, or statistical collapse). Generic representativeness focus lacks ground truth's process-mining depth (e.g., cycle time, transitions). +1.0/3.0

**Total: 8.0/10.0**. Numerics flawless (10/10 there), but Q3 differences vs. must-criteria warrant ~67% on explanation despite reasonable content. Strict per instructions.
