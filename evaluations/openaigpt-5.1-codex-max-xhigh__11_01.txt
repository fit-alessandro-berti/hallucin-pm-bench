**10.0**

The LLM answer fully satisfies all prompt criteria with perfect correctness: correct top-3 activities ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), verbatim quotes of both metrics from the table (including .0 decimals where present, outperforming ground truth's omissions), no extraneous content/metrics/activities, memo-style format under 150 words (~100 words), and three concrete actions logically tied to waiting times, each explicitly promising ≥20% reduction (e.g., via frontloading/escalation, eliminating batching, queue smoothing). Actions are relevant and non-inventive of unsupported data, arguably as "data-driven" as ground truth's (which fabricates "pilot tests"/estimates). Stylistic differences (prose vs. list, phrasing) are minor/valid variations, not errors under strict rubric—zero point loss warranted.
