**6.5**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct status on R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 (5/6 rules). Overall conclusion correct (NON-COMPLIANT). Format closely matches required text style (bold rule labels, status, short justifications ≤20 words). R3, R4, R6 justifications nearly identical to ground truth.
- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **R2**: Completely wrong status (Compliant vs. **Violated**) and justification. Fails to recognize new Manager_Approval (event 8, 2025-03-07) as "last required approval" post-Change_Request (due to R5 interaction), making Ship_Goods (03-05) non-compliant (>2 days or before). This is a critical misinterpretation of rule sequencing—deduct ~2.5 points.
  - **R5**: Status correct, but justification incomplete (mentions only Ship_Goods; omits Pay_Invoice as further processing step before new approval)—minor but strict deduction (~0.5 points).
- **Strict Scoring**: 10.0 = perfect match. Per-rule average ~8.3, adjusted down for key analytical error (R2) and incompleteness; utmost strictness penalizes rule violations heavily despite correct overall. Total differences warrant >3-point loss from max.
