The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact content matching the ground truth (added tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer; removed: Task_ManualReview; gateways: both from exclusive to parallel). However, it omits bullet points (-) for all five list items, which are present in the ground truth, and lacks alignment spacing in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel" vs. ground truth's spaced version). These formatting discrepancies, while minor, constitute small errors under strict evaluation criteria, warranting a deduction from a perfect score.
