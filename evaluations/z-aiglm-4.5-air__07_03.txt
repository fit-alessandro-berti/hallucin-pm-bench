6.0

Analysis:

- The LLM answer correctly identifies all changes (no errors of omission or commission).
- However, there are multiple significant formatting discrepancies when compared to the ground truth:
  - The LLM answer omits the dash ("-") before the task/gateway entries, whereas the ground truth includes them.
  - For gateway type changes, the LLM answer omits the indentation/alignment seen in the ground truth for the second gateway.
- While the answer is strictly factual and does not add commentary (good), failure to follow the required answer format as specified by the ground truth is a significant error per prompt instructions (especially in strict grading).
- Grouping and order of headings are correct.

Due to the strictness requested, these format discrepancies (especially bulleted list requirement) constitute a major loss of points, although the content is complete and accurate.
