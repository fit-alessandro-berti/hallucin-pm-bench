**9.5**

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive → parallel). Headings are verbatim and in order, format follows the specified style (id (name) for tasks, id: old → new for gateways), and no extra content or unchanged elements are mentioned.

The sole difference is minor formatting: the ground truth aligns the "exclusive → parallel" text in the second gateway line using extra whitespace after the colon ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"), while the LLM uses a single space consistent with the prompt's example ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel"). Under utmost strictness, this small whitespace discrepancy warrants a 0.5-point deduction from a perfect 10.0, as it prevents an exact match despite functional and structural perfection.
