**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: The four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") appear exactly as specified with no synonyms or leaks. However, added activities use non-matching phrasings (e.g., "Compliance Officer approval" vs. ground truth "**Compliance Officer Approval**"; "Releases the funds" vs. "**Release Funds**").
- **Activities (+0.5)**: Major violation of "do not rename, merge, or add activities". LLM adds 4 extra rows ("Compliance Officer approval", "Schedule the payment", "Releases the funds", "Notifies the originating analyst") beyond the core 4, while ground truth adds only 2 specific ones. Splits/merges incorrectly (e.g., no "Schedule the payment" or "Notifies" in ground truth; "Release Funds" merged in ground).
- **RACI assignments (-3.5 penalty from base)**: Significant mismatches across nearly all cells (18/24 core cells differ in first 4 rows alone; extras entirely wrong):
  | Activity | Key Differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Comp: I vs. C; Officer: I vs. – |
  | KYC Review | Front: C vs. –; Officer: I vs. C |
  | AML Screening | Front: I vs. – |
  | Risk Scoring | Front: I vs. C; Comp: **R/A** vs. R; Officer: C vs. **A** |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | Treas: I vs. – |
  | Release Funds | Entire row mismatches (extras split wrongly); ground: I/C/C/**R,A** vs. LLM's split I/I/I/**R/A** + extras |
  - Uses **R/A** (slash, combined) vs. ground "**R, A**" (comma, bolded appropriately).
  - Misuses "I" for no involvement instead of "–" (violates key point on dash usage).
- **Formatting/Table structure (-2.3 penalty)**: 
  - No bolding on activities (ground uses **).
  - Compact **R/A** notation vs. separated "**R, A**" or singles (e.g., R, **A**).
  - No "–"; overuses "I".
  - Unaligned column widths; shorter activity labels.
  - Extra rows inflate table invalidly.
- **Overall fidelity**: ~25% cell match on core activities; structural violations dominate. Strict deduction for every mismatch (e.g., each RACI error -0.2; extras -1.0 each; formatting -0.5). Base 5.0 (table structure + vocab) minus penalties = 3.2.
