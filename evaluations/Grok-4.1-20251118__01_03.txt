7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment, penalizing deviations from the ground truth significantly, including the addition of an extraneous "decision point," minor wording inaccuracies, and an incomplete document list. The LLM answer is mostly accurate and structured well but introduces errors that dilute fidelity to the prompt and ground truth.

#### Part (a): Decision Points (Score: 6.0/10)
- **Strengths**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two actual decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate) in one sentence each, closely aligning with the ground truth's rules and phrasing. The TriVote description captures the "any two out of three" rule effectively.
- **Errors and Penalties**:
  - Adds a third, incorrect decision point: The "Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome" (item 1) is not a gate or conditional branch; it's merely an input-generating step. The ground truth omits this entirely, focusing only on the true branches (skip after step 3 and TriVote). This hallucination/inaccurate expansion warrants a major deduction (~3 points), as it misrepresents the process's decision structure.
  - Minor wording issues: "If and only if" in the skip condition is precise but not in ground truth; "at least any two" is redundant; adds "otherwise it is rejected," which is logically implied but not stated in ground truth, introducing unsubstantiated detail (~1 point loss).
- Overall: Covers the core but inflates and slightly alters the set, violating "every decision point" by including non-decision elements.

#### Part (b): Documents List (Score: 9.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Lists all documents in correct first-appearance order (step 1, then step 3 inputs, conditional step 5, step 7, step 8, step 9). Includes useful parenthetical notes on context (e.g., conditional production of Deck Memo, signing of Offer Sheet), which enhance clarity without contradicting the process. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions).
- **Errors and Penalties**:
  - Misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct entry: Ground truth separates it (item 7, first appearing in step 8) from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" (item 6, step 7). The LLM acknowledges signing in its description but folds it into item 6, resulting in only 8 items instead of 9 and undercounting step 8's documents. This is a notable omission under strict "all documents... in the order they first appear" (~1 point loss).
  - ID Matrix Declaration is correctly placed but follows the combined Offer Sheet, slightly disrupting the granularity of step 8.
- Overall: Highly faithful, with the single separation error being a small but significant deviation per instructions.

#### Holistic Assessment
- The answer is comprehensive, well-formatted, and avoids major fabrications, earning baseline competence. However, the extra decision point is a clear structural error, and the document list's incompleteness compounds it. No policy violations or off-topic content. Strictness applied: ~2.5-point total deduction from a potential 10 for these issues, balancing coverage against precision.
