9.0

The LLM answer is almost entirely correct. It accurately identifies that the calculation cannot be performed due to the absence of event data and timestamps, and specifically ties this to the "Approve Invoice" activity, as per the prompt. It also correctly notes that Artefact B is not relevant for computing these metrics from the log.

Small deduction (−1 point): The LLM's explanation is longer and more cautious than the ground truth, mentioning that Artefact B doesn't provide raw or aggregated data for "Approve Invoice", which, while not wrong, goes slightly beyond the strict scope requested ("one short paragraph—do NOT guess or draw on outside knowledge"). Also, it states that it is "impossible to calculate cycle times (as differences between these timestamps), let alone derive the average, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval", which, while correct, could be condensed.

Thus, 9.0 reflects a nearly perfect answer, with only minor verbosity or potentially excessive caution beyond the strict "short paragraph" directive.
