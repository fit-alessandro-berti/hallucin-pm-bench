The LLM answer precisely explains the impossibility of computation due to the absence of data in Artefact A, correctly identifies the required timestamps for cycle time calculation, addresses the irrelevance of Artefact B without guessing, and adheres to the one-short-paragraph format without extraneous details or outside knowledge. It matches the ground truth in substance, conciseness, and accuracy, with only minor stylistic variations (e.g., explicit mention of privacy reasons, which is directly from the prompt) that do not introduce errors.
