2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary Compliance (minor credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison". No forbidden terms. Matches mandate strictly here.
- **Format (partial credit, +1.0)**: Markdown table, clear organization. Bolded RACI notations are readable but deviate from ground truth style.
- **Structure & Coverage (major deductions, -4.0)**: 
  - Wrong columns: Missing "Operations Manager" (critical omission; ground truth has 4 roles, LLM has 3).
  - 8 rows vs. 6: Extraneous rows (#6 SWIFT, #7 archive, #8 notify split/additions); doesn't map 1:1 to ground truth tasks.
  - Task names differ significantly (e.g., LLM #1 "Receive customer transfer instruction and log it..." vs. GT "Receive Payment Instruction"; no "mandated wording" header).
  - No legend or explanatory notes (GT has both).
- **RACI Assignments (major deductions, -5.0)**: No row matches ground truth exactly. Examples:
  | Aspect | LLM | GT | Diff |
  |--------|-----|----|------|
  | Task 1 | TA **R/A**, RL I, IT I | TA **R**, RL I, Ops **A**, IT C | Wrong RACI; missing Ops; IT I vs C |
  | Task 2 | TA **R**, RL **A**, IT I | TA **R**, RL **A**, Ops I, IT C | IT I vs C; missing Ops |
  | Task 3 | TA I, RL **R/A**, IT I | TA C, RL **R**, Ops **A**, IT I | TA I vs C; RL **R/A** vs **R** (+Ops **A**) |
  | Others | All mismatched/new rows | N/A | Complete divergence |
- **Completeness/Fidelity to Source/Prompt (major deductions, -2.0)**: Covers source steps but splits/expands inaccurately vs. GT mapping; invents #8 details.
- **Overall Strictness**: Cumulative differences in roles, rows, tasks, assignments = near-total mismatch. Small errors (e.g., I vs C, bolding style, phrasing) amplify losses per instructions. Only basic vocab/table format salvage minimal score.
