The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, correctly identifying the "No" response and both key counterexamples (C003 with reversed order on lines 6-7, and C005 with Validate_Payment on line 11 lacking any Receive_Order). The justification is concise, cites exact lines and cases, and effectively disproves the "always" claim. Minor deduction for slightly less precise phrasing on C005 ("no subsequent Receive_Order" vs. ground truth's explicit "never contains Receive_Order at all"), which could imply a directional check rather than total absence, though it does not alter the logical validity. Additional inclusion of timestamps is extraneous but factually correct and non-detrimental.
