### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Q1**: Exact match (3 distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). Full credit.
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in A-9321). Full credit.
- **Q3**: Significant error. LLM provides an incorrect timestamp ("2025-04-14T08:00:00.000+00:00"), which is not present in the log and appears to be a fabrication or rounding error. The earliest is explicitly "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00" (Receive_Order for A-9321). No credit—direct fact misrepresentation.
- **Q4**: Major error. LLM counts 3 occurrences of "Quality_Check", but the log shows only 2 (B-1045 at 08:45 and C-77 at 10:00). Likely overcount or hallucination. No credit.
- **Q5**: Critical failure. LLM lists only ["Quality_Check"], which is incorrect—"Quality_Check" *does* start case C-77. The correct list is all activities that never start any case: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] (first events are only "Receive_Order" for A/B and "Quality_Check" for C). Incomplete, wrong content, and misses the question's intent. No credit.

Overall: Only 2/5 questions correct (40% accuracy), with the errors in Q3-Q5 being factual distortions or misunderstandings of the log, violating the "only use facts... reply 'UNKNOWN' if absent" rule. Strict deduction for small (Q3) and large (Q4/Q5) inaccuracies results in a low score; no partial credit for approximations.
