3.0

The LLM answer largely misses critical details from the event log.

- Q1: Correct (3 distinct case IDs).
- Q2: Correct ("Pack_Items" precedes "Ship_Order" in A-9321).
- Q3: INCORRECT—LLM says "2025-04-14T08:00:00.000+00:00", but the earliest in the fragment is "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00".
- Q4: INCORRECT—LLM says 3, but "Quality_Check" appears only twice.
- Q5: INCORRECT—LLM gives only ["Quality_Check"], but the correct list is ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"].

With only Q1 and Q2 correct, and all other answers showing significant errors, a 3.0 is appropriate under strict grading.
