The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, faithfully summarizing the three core decision points with correct conditions, terminology, and flow implications, while listing all required documents verbatim from the prompt without introducing extraneous terms. Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly stating positional context (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") as in the ground truth; (2) slight phrasing variations in documents (e.g., including "old" and "single ... or" where ground truth abbreviates, and retaining "template" while ground truth omits it); (3) lacking the ground truth's clarifying note on excluded standard documents, which reinforces the prompt's non-standard emphasis; and (4) less concise formatting (e.g., full sentences vs. arrow-based brevity). No major errors or omissions, but these small differences warrant a strict but not severe reduction from perfection.
