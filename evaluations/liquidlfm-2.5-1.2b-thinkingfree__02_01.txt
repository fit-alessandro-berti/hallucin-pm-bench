**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict per-question analysis):
- **Q1**: Exact match (3). Full points.
- **Q2**: Completely incorrect ("B-1045" is a case ID, not the preceding activity "Pack_Items"). Major factual error. 0 points.
- **Q3**: Timestamp time matches but omits milliseconds (`.000`) and timezone (`+00:00`), violating exact ISO-8601 format from log/ground truth. Small but significant deduction per instructions. Partial credit only.
- **Q4**: Incorrect count (1 vs. 2; missed C-77 event). Factual error. 0 points.
- **Q5**: Empty list vs. correct `["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]`. Failed to identify first events (Receive_Order x2, Quality_Check x1). Major error. 0 points.

**Overall**: 1/5 exact matches, with partial on Q3. Severe deviations (3 major errors, 1 minor) justify low score under utmost strictness. Average ~2.0 after weighting.
