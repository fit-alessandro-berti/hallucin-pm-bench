7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all the changes and under the right headings, and uses the correct ids and task names/gateway changes. However, there are notable formatting differences from the ground truth:

- The LLM omits the leading dashes ("- ") at the start of each item.
- The LLM puts task ids and names directly together (e.g., Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)), whereas the ground truth puts a dash and a space before the id (e.g., - Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)).
- For gateway changes, the LLM adds quotation marks around the arrow: «exclusive → parallel», while the ground truth omits them (just exclusive → parallel). However, both use the correct arrow symbol and order.
- The LLM omits indentation and spacing format for the gateway type changes (the ground truth aligns the arrows).

Despite these formatting differences, all content is accurate and precise. Since the instructions say to grade with utmost strictness and penalize even small errors significantly, the score must not be higher than 7.5.
