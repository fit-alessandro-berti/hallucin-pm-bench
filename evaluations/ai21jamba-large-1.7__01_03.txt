5.0

**Explanation:**

a) **Decision Points**

- The LLM answer identifies four "decision points," but only two true decision points exist in the process (per ground truth):  
  (1) the conditional skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check, and  
  (2) the TriVote approval stage.  
- The LLM splits the bypass/manual underwrite as two separate decisions (actually one branch), and wrongly lists "Applicant Confirmation" as a decision point, which is not a process gate but simply execution of an agreed step.
- The LLM describes the TriVote gate correctly, but minor phrasing in its decision rule is slightly less precise than the ground truth (“at least two approvals required for the loan to proceed” is correct, but slightly less explicit than “only when at least two of three approvers record 'Approve'”).
- The LLM incorrectly describes the risk/amount branch as part of Tri-Color-Risk-Check, but also as a separate manual underwrite step, and does not cleanly separate the logic as one dual-criteria condition.

b) **Document List**

- The LLM lists all required documents and is nearly complete, but it does NOT clearly separate "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (it mentions "returned with their signed confirmation" but not as a separate document), which is explicitly a document per the process.
- It (1) incorrectly clusters the three Scorecards on a single line when order of first appearance is required,  
(2) fails to explicitly list "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate item,  
(3) The descriptive phrase "used during manual-underwriting" etc. are extraneous, though that does not count as a major error.
- The ordering of the Scorecards is ambiguous (they should be listed separately and explicitly in order).
- The LLM does not hallucinate any out-of-process documents (good), but it imprecisely describes "Offer Sheet 77" as "generated for the applicant and returned with their signed confirmation"—missing the fact that the signed version is a required document and treated distinctly.

**Grading justification:**
- **Major errors:** 
    - Incorrect number and nature of decision points; inclusion of non-gates as gates.
    - Document list imperfect: Scorecards not itemized; "Signed Offer Sheet 77" missing as a distinct line.
- **Partial credit:** 
    - The main logic of the process is present, and documents are mostly correct in content.
    - No hallucinations; no false documents.
- **Small but impactful omissions/inaccuracies:** 
    - Slight imprecision in rule language and document listing, per the instructions for strictness.
- **Loss of at least 5 points for these errors, but not complete failure; hence, 5.0.**
