**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (40% weight)**: Correct count (1) and reference to CaseID 1002. Minor deduction for omitting exact timestamp (09:07:13) as in ground truth; strictness demands precision. **9.0/10**.
- **Part 2 (60% weight)**: Major deviations. Uses case-based 33% frequency (vs. ground truth's event-based ~7%/14 events swing). Introduces ungrounded speculation ("bias toward complex/high-risk cases", "most cases might bypass") violating "no speculation" rule. Misses core ground truth points: tiny sample metrics (14 events/3 cases/<2h), 0-7% volatility, wide confidence intervals, rare-event sampling error, near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and string-matching pitfalls. Vague "small sample risks" lacks statistical rigor. Word count compliant (~80). **Overall weak match.** **2.5/10**.

Composite: Significant content/accuracy gaps yield low score.
