The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" and accurately pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event citations, matching the ground truth's violated rules. Format is numbered and cites rules as required. However, significant deductions for:
- **Incomplete analysis (major difference, -1.5 points):** Does not evaluate all 5 rules like the ground truth, omitting explicit confirmation that Rules 1, 4, and 5 are satisfied (e.g., no mention of proper PO approvals, Intern not following CFO, or proper ending).
- **Factual error in distance calculation (-0.5 points):** States "distance is 4" for Rule 3 (based on position span or misframing intervening events), while ground truth specifies "distance = 3" (aligning with 3 intervening events #7–#9); both agree on violation but numerical mismatch under strictness.
Minor stylistic differences (no full summary phrase like "at least one rule violated" or exhaustive details) do not further deduct but reinforce incompleteness. Overall strong on core violations but lacks ground truth's comprehensive audit structure.
