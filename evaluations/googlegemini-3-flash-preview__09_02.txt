The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in conclusion and reasoning (correctly identifies impossibility due to absent timestamps/durations despite equal start/complete counts), is equally concise, and accurately references the provided data sources. Minor deductions for non-verbatim phrasing ("cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "no timestamp data or durations for the event transitions" vs. "no timestamps or duration information... only event counts—so the required start-to-completion intervals are absent"), which slightly less precisely highlights the need for per-instance start-complete intervals.
