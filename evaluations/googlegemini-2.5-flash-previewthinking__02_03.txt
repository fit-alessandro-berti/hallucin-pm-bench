9.5

- The LLM answer gives correct and concise bullet-point answers.
- There is a small deviation in formatting compared to the ground truth:
  - The ground truth puts bold (or code) markup to the answers; the LLM uses asterisks for bold only in activity names, not for the number of cases.
  - The LLM answer does not label the individual answers (e.g., A1, A2, A3) or mark the case values in parentheses.
- However, the factual content for all three questions is correct and matches the ground truth.
- The minor formatting/styling and labeling differences merit only a small deduction under strict grading.
