10.0

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in verdict (fact is inaccurate/not accurate), structure (case-by-case bullet-point justification), key evidence (reversed order in cases 1001/1003 with accurate activity sequences; absence in 1002 disproving "always"), and strict adherence to data without guessing. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., no "Short verdict" header, no line citations which were not required by the user prompt, explicit mention of Quality_Check which enhances precision without error) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation criteria focused on factual alignment, citations of cases/activities, and accuracy. No deductions warranted.
