The LLM answer is an exact match in conclusion (cannot be derived/computed due to missing timestamps/durations) and reasoning (explicitly references redacted timestamps/elapsed-time fields matching the context; identifies correct count of 4 occurrences without fabricating data; provides accurate formula). It is more precise than the ground truth by directly quoting the context's redaction note, while adding no contradictions or extras that violate strictness. No differences or errors.
