10.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in structure, content, and evidence. It correctly identifies the inaccuracy, provides case-specific justifications with precise citations (using timestamps, which are equivalently valid to the ground truth's line references), notes the absence in Case 1002, highlights the reversed order where both activities occur, and explicitly addresses the "immediately before" claim in its conclusion without introducing errors or omissions. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., narrative vs. bulleted format) do not detract from the factual match.
