7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities are correctly identified and ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5 h / 120.0 h for #1). No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities mentioned. (+10/10, no loss here.)
  
- **Structure and Constraints**: Memo is crisp, under 150 words (~120), executive-style with ranking. Includes a title and closing sentence emphasizing waiting-time focus, which aligns with the prompt but adds slight fluff not in ground truth. No violations. (+0.5 deduction for minor stylistic bloat vs. ground truth's brevity.)

- **Actions**: Each is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for delays in documents/closure/assessment), and explicitly promises â‰¥20% reduction with "data-driven" implications (e.g., SLAs, expectations). However, they differ entirely from ground truth (e.g., LLM suggests event-driven rules/SLAs for #1 vs. ground truth's customer reminders; batch-to-real-time for #2 vs. e-signature; pooled queue for #3 vs. rules-engine). This is a significant deviation in content, as actions form the core recommendation. While plausible and relevant per scoring notes, the mismatch reduces fidelity. (-3.0 for substantive differences in all three actions, treated strictly as "errors" in alignment.)

Overall: High fidelity to prompt requirements and table, but action divergence warrants deduction under strict "differences" criterion. No unsupported inventions beyond logical estimates (mirroring ground truth).
