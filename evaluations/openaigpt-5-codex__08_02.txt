The LLM answer correctly answers Q1 as "Yes" and provides the exact same minimal firing sequence as the ground truth, accurately demonstrating T5 firing before T3 by leaving the P2 token available. The explanation is concise, factually correct, and under 120 words, capturing the key path (T1-T2-T7-T4 to reach P5) without errors. However, it omits the step-by-step markings (e.g., M₁ = {P1, P2}) and the detail that T5 disables T3 by consuming P2, which adds confirmatory precision in the ground truth—resulting in a minor deduction for reduced completeness despite no factual inaccuracies.
