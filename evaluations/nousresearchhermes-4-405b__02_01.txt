The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1â€“Q4, earning full credit there. However, Q5 contains a critical error: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77) in the list of activities that never start a case, resulting in an extra and factually wrong item compared to the ground truth's precise 3-item list. Under utmost strictness, this substantive inaccuracy in one key response warrants a 2-point deduction from a perfect 10.
