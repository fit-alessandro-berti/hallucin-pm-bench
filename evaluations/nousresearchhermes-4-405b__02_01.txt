8.0

The LLM's answer matches the ground truth for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 exactly. The only deviation is in Q5: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list of activities that never appear as the first event of any case, when in fact "Quality_Check" is the first event of case "C-77" and thus should not be listed. This is a significant but isolated error, so 2 points are deducted. Therefore, the strict score is 8.0.
