7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Correctness (High marks, but not perfect):** The LLM correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" and pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3), which align with the ground truth's reasons for non-compliance. This captures the essence of why the trace fails.
- **Justification Coverage (Significant deduction):** The ground truth provides a comprehensive analysis of *all five rules*, explicitly stating which are satisfied (Rules 1, 4, 5) with supporting details (e.g., approval order, Intern sequencing, ending activity). The LLM only addresses the violated rules (2 and 3), omitting confirmation that the others are satisfied. This makes the response incomplete and less rigorous, as a full audit should verify the entire rule set to justify the overall verdict. Under strict evaluation, this partial coverage is a major shortfall.
- **Accuracy of Details (Minor deduction):** 
  - Rule 2: Fully accurate—correctly notes `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) after `Ship_Goods` (event 8), matching ground truth.
  - Rule 3: Correctly identifies the violation but inaccurately describes the distance as "four activities away" (from event 6 to 10, it's actually the 4th subsequent activity, but ground truth specifies "distance = 3" based on steps beyond the next two events). This small wording error reflects careless precision, warranting a point loss per instructions.
- **Format and Clarity (Minor deduction):** The LLM's response is concise and numbered, similar to the ground truth, but lacks the explicit conclusion tying back to "overall NON-COMPLIANT" due to specific violations. It also uses an en-dash in "Non‑compliant" (formatting nitpick, but noted).
- **Strictness Applied:** With utmost strictness, the incompleteness (missing rules analysis) and minor distance inaccuracy result in a ~2.5-point deduction from a potential 10.0, as these could mislead on the trace's full compliance status despite the correct high-level call.
