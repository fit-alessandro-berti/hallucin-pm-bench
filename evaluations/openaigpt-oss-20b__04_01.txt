- The LLM answer gets the overall conclusion ("Non-compliant") correct.
- It identifies the correct rules that are violated (Rule 2 and Rule 3) and correctly describes why: that `Risk_Assessment` does not occur before `Ship_Goods`, and that `Three_way_match` occurs outside the required distance after `Goods_Received`.
- However, it **omits** mention of all rules that are **satisfied** (Rules 1, 4, and 5), which are clearly detailed in the ground truth and expected per the audited answer structure.
- The LLM also miscounts the distance for Rule 3: it claims that `Three_way_match` is "four activities away" from `Goods_Received` (events 6 → 10), when in fact the correct distance is 3 (events 6 → 7 → 8 → 10), which is specifically highlighted in the ground truth.
- The justification is less formal, not referencing activity/role names with event indices as precisely as the ground truth, and does not explicitly confirm for the satisfied rules.
- It does not mention Rule 1 at all (although it is satisfied), nor does it address that Rule 4 and Rule 5 are not violated, missing the expected comprehensive checklist for strict audit.

Thus, while the main violations are correctly spotted, the answer lacks the completeness, accuracy, and strict formalism shown in the ground truth. This results in significant point loss.
