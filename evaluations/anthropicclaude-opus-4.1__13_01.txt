10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth across all questions. It accurately counts the single occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check" (in case A1002), computes the percentage correctly as 5.56% (even without displaying the formula, the result is precise), lists the correct and only case identifier, and provides two valid sampling-related reasons (small sample size and temporal bias/short time window) that directly align with the ground truth options (no deviations, inferences, or errors). No hallucinations or unjustified assumptions from the log data.
