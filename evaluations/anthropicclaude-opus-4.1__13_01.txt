9.0

**Evaluation:**

1. **Count of "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurrences (Q1):**  
   - LLM answer: "1 time"  
   - Ground truth: `1`  
   - **Match.**

2. **Percentage of logged events (Q2):**  
   - LLM answer: "1 out of 18 events = 5.56%"  
   - Ground truth: `5.56 %` (with calculation shown)  
   - **Partial match**. The LLM provides the correct value with basic calculation. However, explicitly including the calculation as a formula as in ground truth would be ideal, though this is not strictly required.

3. **List case identifier(s) (Q3):**  
   - LLM answer: "A1002"  
   - Ground truth: Only case **A1002**  
   - **Match.**

4. **Two sampling-related reasons (Q4):**  
   - LLM answer:  
     - "Insufficient sample size": Correct, with explanation.  
     - "Limited time window": Correct, with explanation.  
   - Ground truth: Accepts small sample size and temporal bias. Also allows for case-mix bias and survivorship bias.  
   - **Match.** Both reasons are valid, clear, and derive strictly from the provided data.

**Minor issues:**
- For Q2, the LLM answer includes both "1 out of 18 events" and "5.56%." While the calculation is correct, it could be clearer to explicitly state the percentage alone (as in ground truth). However, no extraneous information or inferences are made.

**No major or unjustified inferences or omissions.**

**Thus, full marks minus 1 point for extremely minor formatting differences and not showing the division formula exactly as in the ground truth.**

**Final strict score: 9.0**
