10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and aligns closely with the ground truth in identifying the key counter-examples (C003 and C005) that disprove the claim, with precise citations to line numbers and case-IDs. It adheres to the prompt's format by starting with "No" and providing a single-paragraph justification without extraneous details or errors. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "the stated fact is inaccurate" vs. "the claim is false") do not detract from its correctness or conciseness, warranting a perfect score under strict evaluation.
