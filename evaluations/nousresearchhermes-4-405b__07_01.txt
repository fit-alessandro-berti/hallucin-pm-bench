The LLM answer identifies the correct factual differences (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr` tasks, removed `send_rma_label` task, and `gw_valid` gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive). However, it loses significant points for the following strict deviations from the ground truth and prompt requirements:

- **Incomplete task descriptions**: Lists only task IDs (e.g., `check_vip`) instead of the full element details as in ground truth (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," which includes the `name` attribute; omitting names is a major factual incompleteness, especially since ground truth prioritizes names with IDs in parentheses.
- **Heading format mismatch**: Uses "###" markdown headers and "•" bullets, while ground truth uses "**bold**" headers and "*" bullets. The prompt specifies "exact headings" like "• Added tasks," which neither fully matches, but the LLM's variation further deviates from the ground truth standard.
- **Missing closing note**: Omits the ground truth's explanatory note "*(No other differences should be reported.)*," which reinforces adherence to the prompt's "only factual differences" rule.
- **Minor formatting inconsistencies**: No bolding on gateway types as in ground truth (e.g., **exclusiveGateway**), and slight phrasing differences (e.g., backticks around IDs inconsistently applied).

These errors, though not fabricating facts, represent small but strict violations in completeness, exactness, and presentation, warranting a mid-range score rather than full credit.
