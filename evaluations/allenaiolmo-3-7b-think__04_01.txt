8.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high marks base)**: Correct overall verdict ("Non-compliant"). Accurately identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with correct event citations and reasoning (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods; Three_way_match too late). Mentions other rules (1, 4, 5) are satisfied, aligning with ground truth conclusion.
- **Major deductions (strictness applied)**:
  1. **Incomplete structure and comprehensiveness (-1.5)**: Ground truth provides a full, numbered audit of **all 5 rules** (satisfied or not), with detailed evidence (e.g., Rule 1 cites PO amount and order; Rule 4 explains Intern/CFO separation with events). LLM only numbers/explains violations (2 items), lumping others into a summary. Question requests "numbered justification that cites the relevant rules," but ground truth's exhaustive style is the benchmark—LLM is less thorough.
  2. **Factual error in Rule 3 distance (-0.5)**: LLM states "distance = 4" ("four activities later"). Ground truth explicitly states "distance = 3" (10-6-1=3 intervening activities: 7,8,9). This mismatches ground truth's counting convention, despite rule phrasing "distance ≤2." Small but quantifiable error = significant loss per instructions.
- **Minor deductions**: No explicit summary like ground truth's "overall **NON-COMPLIANT**" (-0.2, phrasing/format nit); less precise phrasing (e.g., no PO amount/approval order detail for Rule 1).
- **Total**: Starts at 10, deducts 2.2 for differences → 7.8 rounded to 8.0. Very good but not identical; strictness penalizes gaps vs. ground truth.
