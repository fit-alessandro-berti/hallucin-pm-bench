The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in values and calculations. For question 3, the response is under 100 words (68 words), addresses the single occurrence, highlights statistical fragility/instability (e.g., fragile correlations, distortion of averages, overfitting), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., misleading rules from one case), fulfilling all specified criteria without invention or deviation from the log data. No errors or differences warrant deduction.
