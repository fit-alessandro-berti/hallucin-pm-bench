The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifies **No** and the two key counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 lacking Receive_Order), with precise citations matching the ground truth. It adheres to the "one paragraph" format and proves the claim false equivalently. Minor deductions for extraneous details (timestamps and "2 minutes" calculation, not in ground truth) and slight phrasing variations ("occurring **before**" vs. "occurs first"; "universally follow" vs. "**not always**"), which introduce non-essential differences under utmost strictness.
