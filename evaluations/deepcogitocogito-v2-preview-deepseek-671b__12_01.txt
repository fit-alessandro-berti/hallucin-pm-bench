The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a solid, evidence-based justification citing case IDs and activity orders, aligning closely with the ground truth's core conclusions (reversal in Cases 1001 and 1003, absence in Case 1002). However, deductions for: (1) minor inaccuracy in describing Case 1002 as "irrelevant" rather than explicitly noting it disproves the "always" claim; (2) inclusion of visible internal reasoning ("Okay, I need to check..."), making the response less concise than the "short justification" requested; (3) lack of precise line citations (e.g., lines 3-4, 11-14) as in the ground truth; and (4) slightly less structured formatting (no bold verdict or bulleted evidence), which reduces exactness under strict evaluation.
