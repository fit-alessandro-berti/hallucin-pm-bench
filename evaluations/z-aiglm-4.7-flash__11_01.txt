**3.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers/ranking)**: Activities and quoted times match table exactly (full credit here). **But ranking is fundamentally wrong**: #1 Request_Documents (correct, 36.5/120), but #2 Assess_Liability (7.8/16.4) before #3 Send_Closure_Letter (12.2/44)—violates "strictly by waiting-time" (avg: 36.5 > **12.2 > 7.8**). Ground truth order correct. Major deduction (-4.0).
- **No unwarranted content**: Perfect—no service-time, throughput, or extra activities (-0).
- **Actions**: Concrete, logically tied to waiting-time, claim ≥20% cut. Relevant but **not data-driven** (no pilots/estimates like ground truth's "≥25%", "30%", "20-25%"); generic proposals differ entirely. Significant differences (-2.0).
- **Format/conciseness**: Crisp memo ≤150 words (92 words), executive style. But lacks explicit "#1 → #3" ranking labels matching ground truth structure (-0.5). Minor notation (e.g., "44h" vs "44 h") (-0.3).

**Total differences from ground truth**: Wrong ranking/order (critical), divergent actions, format variance. Strict penalty applied.
