10.0

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate/No), coverage of all three cases with correct observations on ordering/absence, and conclusion (no instances of the claimed sequence). It strictly adheres to the prompt's request for a short justification citing case IDs and activities, without unnecessary additions. Stylistic differences (paragraph vs. bulleted structure, lack of line numbers or bolding) are minor and not required by the prompt; line citations in ground truth contain a small inaccuracy (case 1003 cites lines 11 & 14, but Update_Inventory is line 12). No errors or omissions in LLM answer warrant deduction under strict evaluation.
