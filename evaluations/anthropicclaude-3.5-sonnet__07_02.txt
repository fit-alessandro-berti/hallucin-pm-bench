6.0

**Evaluation Breakdown:**

**Added tasks:**  
- The LLM answer listed "Verify Identity" and "Request Additional Documents" â€“ both are correct.
- It missed "Final Reject" (`Task_FinalReject`), which is a newly added task and should have been included under this heading.
  - Significant deduction, as omitting an added task is a clear factual error for this question type.

**Removed tasks:**  
- Stated that "Reject Loan" (`Task_RejectLoan`) was replaced by "Final Reject."
- The correct behavior is to list only "Reject Loan" as *removed*; the "replaced by" comment is unrequested interpretation, and in fact, "Reject Loan" is simply removed and "Final Reject" is newly added.  
- Counts as a minor deviation from the required terse, factual style, and as a slight misclassification of the changes.

**Gateway-type changes:**  
- Correctly stated that "Gateway_Decision" was changed from exclusive to inclusive.

**Adherence to Structure:**  
- Headings are accurate.
- No mention of other changes, cosmetic renames, or order, which is correct.

**Summary:**  
- Omitted one of the three added tasks (+ notable error).
- Incorrectly worded the removed task (implies a replacement, which muddies the strictly factual summary).
- Otherwise structurally sound and captured the gateway-type change.

**Strict Marking Justification:**  
- Omission of one out of three items is a major factual gap (33% miss rate in that section).
- Slightly incorrect phrasing with "replaced by" instead of strictly listing as removed.
- A 6.0 reflects: correct basic structure, but major factual omission and minor stylistic deviation.
