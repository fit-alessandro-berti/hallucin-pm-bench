4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: The LLM correctly identifies 2 out of 3 additions ("Verify Identity" and "Request Additional Documents"), but completely misses "Final Reject" (Task_FinalReject), treating it instead as a "replacement" under Removed tasks. This is a major omission, as the ground truth explicitly lists it as a separate addition, violating the strict heading-based grouping and leading to a significant structural mismatch.
- **Removed tasks**: The LLM identifies the correct task ("Reject Loan"), but incorrectly qualifies it as "replaced by" another, introducing extraneous interpretation not present in the ground truth or instructions. The ground truth lists it cleanly as removed without reference to replacements, making this a clear deviation.
- **Gateway-type changes**: Fully accurate, matching the ground truth in identifying the exclusive to inclusive change for "Gateway_Decision" (including the XOR/OR notation, though the LLM omits the abbreviations, which is minor).
- **Overall**: The response adds unnecessary commentary (e.g., on ignoring renames), which dilutes adherence to the "strictly under the three requested headings" instruction. With strict evaluation, the core errors in addition/removal classification (misclassifying a replacement as a single event instead of separate add/remove) represent ~50% inaccuracy in the primary content, warranting substantial point deduction from a perfect 10.0. No credit for format adherence, as the ground truth uses precise numbering and bolding, while the LLM uses bullets inconsistently.
