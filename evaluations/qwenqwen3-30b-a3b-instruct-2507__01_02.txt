4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially addresses the prompt but contains significant inaccuracies in identifying and summarizing decision points, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Here's a breakdown:

#### Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% of Prompt Weight)
- **Core Issue**: The prompt requires summarizing *decision points* (i.e., branching or approval gates where the process diverges based on conditions). The ground truth correctly identifies only three: Underwriter Alignment Gate (with precise condition and escalation), Amount Threshold Decision (with exact branching to auto-approval or MBA), and Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) (with vote outcome). These use exact activity names and focus on decision logic.
- **LLM Flaws**:
  - Includes irrelevant steps as "decision points": Quick KYC Verification (KYC) is a linear verification (no branching/decision), and Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC) is a mandatory collection step (no condition-based divergence; ground truth omits it entirely as non-decisional).
  - Lists 5 items instead of 3, diluting focus and introducing non-decisions. This misrepresents the process flow.
  - Descriptions for valid points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, MBA) are mostly accurate but lack the ground truth's precise phrasing (e.g., no explicit "branch after Dual Underwriter Split" context; MBA description omits bolding/capitalization of "Approve/Reject" as in GT).
  - Structure uses bold headers and numbering but doesn't match GT's "#### Decision points" format or conditional asterisk-style details, reducing fidelity.
- **Impact**: These are not minor—wrongly expanding decision points violates "summarise the decision points" and "use exactly the activity names given." Significant deduction (~6 points lost from 10).

#### Required Documents (~40% of Prompt Weight)
- **Strengths**: Lists all 6 exact items using provided terminology (no standard loan terms introduced). Matches ground truth core content.
- **Minor Errors** (Strict Penalty Applied):
  - Proof of Address: "≤ 3 months old" vs. GT's concise "≤ 3 months" (unnecessary "old").
  - Latest Income Statement: "single pay-stub or tax slip" adds "single" and uses "or" instead of GT's "pay-stub/tax slip" slash—alters phrasing slightly.
  - Community Impact Statement: Adds "template" not in GT's "(CIS)".
  - Omits GT's parenthetical note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which reinforces the non-standard process but isn't explicitly required—still, it completes the "every required document" context.
- **Impact**: Near-match, but small wording variances and missing note deduct ~1 point (strictness amplifies these as fidelity issues).

#### Overall
- **Adherence to Prompt**: Uses exact names (good), avoids standard terminology (good), but fails on summarization accuracy and completeness. Total alignment ~40%, hence 4.0. No jailbreak/policy issues noted.
