6.0

- The LLM answer presents the required documents accurately, matching the ground truth list with correct names and order. No loss of points here.
- However, the **decision points** section has notable issues:
    - The LLM answer incorrectly lists "Quick KYC Verification (KYC)" and "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" as decision points. In the process, these are activities, not decision gates.
    - It omits that "Underwriter Alignment Gate" is explicitly after the Dual Underwriter Split (missing placement and context).
    - It does not specify the branching logic steps as clearly or specifically as the ground truth (e.g., definition of branches and outcomes at each point, especially at Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision).
    - The LLM answer compresses and merges some decision points without preserving all the described branching logic.

Given the prompt’s strictness, inclusion of non-decision activities as "decision points," and failure to faithfully reproduce the process flow logic, these errors are significant. However, since all documents are correct and no terminology is invented, the answer is not failing—but is substantially flawed in process accuracy. Thus, 6.0 is justified.
