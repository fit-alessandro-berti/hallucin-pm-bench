**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major deficiency, ~50% of prompt weight)**: Ground truth identifies **3 distinct decision points** (eligibility in triage, amount threshold, final approval/rejection). LLM identifies **only 1** (amount threshold, correctly but incompletely named "High-Value Refund Check"). Misses triage eligibility check and approval/rejection at pre-approve/auditor stages entirely. Claims "single explicit decision point," directly contradicting ground truth. No mention of rejection paths/outcomes. Format (prose vs. table) is minor but adds difference. **Score: 1.5/10** (1/3 identified; strict penalty for omission of "every").
- **Required Documents (excellent match, ~50% of prompt weight)**: Lists **all 7 exactly** as ground truth (order minor variance irrelevant). Correctly notes AuditTrail conditional use. No introductions. Closing note aligns. **Score: 10/10**.
- **Overall**: Weighted average ~5.75, reduced to **4.0** for utmost strictness (significant content gaps/mismatches in core task half; assertive inaccuracy on count; format divergence). No policy violations or extras introduced.
