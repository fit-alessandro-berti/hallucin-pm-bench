3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (mandated synonyms and avoidance of forbidden terms)**: Perfect adherence (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance used correctly; no legacy terms appear). No point loss here.
- **Structure and Unwarranted Content**: Minor deduction for including abbreviations (e.g., (AM)) in column headers, which introduces slight extraneous detail not present in the ground truth (full names only). No extra rows/columns/tasks added, but table formatting differs slightly (e.g., bolding on R cells vs. activity names). This is a small error but warrants a 0.5 point loss under strictness.
- **RACI Correctness**: Major failures, leading to heavy deduction (6.5 point loss total). The narrative implies Account Manager (AM) accountability in most steps (e.g., as handler of initiation/end), yet the LLM omits all "A" designations entirely—no R/A combinations or standalone A's (e.g., Receive Application should be R/A for AM, not just R; KYC Review has A for AM missing; etc.). Multiple per-row errors in C/I allocations:
  - Receive Application: Misses A for AM.
  - KYC Review: Wrong I for AM (should be A); wrong I for FC (should be C).
  - Order Vetting: Misses A for AM; wrong I for CO (should be C); wrong C for FC (should be I).
  - Payment Clearance: Wrong I for AM (should be A); wrong I for CO (should be C).
  - Record Update: Wrong I for AM (should be C); wrong I for FC (should be C).
  - Notify Customer: Misses A for AM.
  Each activity has one R (correct per notes), but the overall allocations do not "reflect the narrative" fully, as AM's accountability role is ignored. Under utmost strictness, these are not small errors—systematic omissions and swaps across ~70% of cells justify severe scoring.
- **Overall**: Starts from 10.0 baseline, deducts heavily for RACI inaccuracies (core to prompt). Self-awareness N/A as noted.
