9.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth answer—both enumerate two sets of concurrently executable tasks, accurately reflecting Process B's parallel blocks and the exact tasks involved in each. The order and pairings of parallel tasks are correct, and the answer omits information about other processes, per instructions.

Minor grounds for point deduction:
- The LLM answer does not use exactly the same set notation as the ground truth (`Set 1`, `Set 2`, or the double line `‖` between tasks).
- The explicit text "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel" is omitted.

While the differences are quite small (mainly stylistic/wording and an omitted negative confirmation), strict criteria call for a point deduction. Thus, the answer earns a 9.0.
