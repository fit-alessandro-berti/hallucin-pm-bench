The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" compliance due to Rule 3 violation, with accurate assessments of all rules matching the ground truth logic. However, significant deductions for: (1) excessive verbosity and visible internal self-corrections/rambling (violates "short justification"), (2) messy formatting (duplicated "**No**", run-on sentences like "**No**The trace"), (3) bullet-point structure instead of table, (4) omission of "once each" explicitness for Rule 1 in the final summary (ground truth includes it), and (5) overall lack of concise, professional table format. These stylistic and presentation flaws represent notable differences under strict evaluation criteria.
