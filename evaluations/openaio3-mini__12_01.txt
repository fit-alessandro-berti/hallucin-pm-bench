The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a valid counterexample from Case 1001 (reversed order) and Case 1003 (Authorize_Refund after Update_Inventory), with accurate sequence citations matching the log. However, it omits Case 1002 entirely, where the absence of Update_Inventory directly falsifies the "always" claim (as noted in the ground truth), making the justification incomplete and less comprehensive. This gap in covering all relevant cases results in a partial deduction under strict evaluation, despite the overall correct verdict and no factual errors in the covered examples.
