2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer scores low due to substantial deviations from the ground truth in core RACI assignments, completeness, and format, despite minor adherence to terminology. Key issues:

- **Terminology (partial credit)**: Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" without forbidden terms (+1.0 point). Activities match the six steps, but lacks ground truth bolding on key terms (e.g., **KYC Review**).

- **RACI Allocations (major failures, -5.0+ penalty)**: Assignments do not reflect the process narrative or ground truth. 
  - Responsibles are partially correct (e.g., AM for Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer; FC for Payment Clearance; IT for Record Update), but KYC Review incorrectly assigns "C" to CO instead of "R" (direct contradiction to "performed by the Compliance Officer").
  - No "A" (Accountable) assignments at all; ground truth assigns "A" (often combined as "R/A") to AM for most activities, reflecting ownership.
  - No "I" (Informed) assignments; ground truth fills nearly all cells with "I" for uninvolved roles, indicating broad awareness. LLM leaves ~70% of cells blank, implying no involvement, which is incomplete and inaccurate.
  - No "C" (Consulted) beyond one error; ground truth has multiple (e.g., CO "C" for Receive Application and Order Vetting; FC "C" for KYC Review).
  - Each row lacks exactly one "R" per activity in LLM (mostly correct), but overall matrix ignores consultations, accountabilities, and notifications from the narrative (e.g., "once documents arrive" implies CO input elsewhere).

- **Format and Structure (errors, -2.0 penalty)**: 
  - Headers include unnecessary abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") vs. ground truth's clean full names.
  - No "R/A" combinations or bolding on primaries (e.g., **R** for key roles).
  - Adds unwarranted legend explaining RACI (ground truth has none; notes specify no extra content).
  - Table structure is similar but incomplete (blanks vs. full population).

- **Overall Correctness and Unwarranted Content**: Fails to fully "reflect the narrative" (e.g., AM's central role implies more "A"; support roles imply "I"). ~60% mismatch in cell contents. No extra tasks/roles, but legend is extraneous.

This results in a fundamentally flawed matrix unsuitable for process-mapping, warranting a minimal score.
