4.0

**Justification:**

- **Terminology Compliance (positive):** The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" and avoids the forbidden terms. This is a major requirement and is handled well.
- **Structure (positive):** The matrix header and legend formatting are professional and clear.

**Major Errors:**

1. **Incorrect RACI assignments throughout:**  
   - "Receive Application": Ground truth assigns **R / A** to AM, C to CO, I to FC/IT. LLM assigns only R to AM; omits A, C, and I—this is a significant loss.
   - "KYC Review": Ground truth—A to AM, **R** to CO, C to FC, I to IT; LLM gives only C to CO, omitting R, A, C, and I; significant divergence.
   - "Order Vetting": Ground truth—**R/A** to AM, C to CO, I to FC/IT. LLM gives only R to AM.
   - "Payment Clearance": Ground truth—A to AM, C to CO, **R** to FC, I to IT. LLM gives only R to FC.
   - "Record Update": Ground truth—C to AM/FC, I to CO, **R** to IT. LLM gives only R to IT.
   - "Notify Customer": Ground truth—**R/A** to AM, I to all others. LLM gives only R to AM.
   - In every row, the LLM omits most of the roles involved (usually only one entry per row). It also fails to represent the dual 'R / A' where used.

2. **Legend error:**  
   - The LLM gives a legend for R, C, A, I, but then never uses A or I in the matrix at all (whereas the ground truth uses them extensively, including combined 'R / A'). The LLM also uses C for "Consulted" at KYC Review, but ground truth uses R for CO there.
   - This is not just an omission but a misunderstanding of RACI assignment requirements.

3. **Failure to reflect involvement:**  
   - Important roles being Informed or Consulted are omitted. In practice, many rows should have multiple entries, not just one entry per activity. This underrepresents process complexity and fails the process-mapping consultancy standard.

**Small error:**

- In "KYC Review," the LLM marks CO as "C" (Consulted), but ground truth says CO is "R" (Responsible); this is an outright contradiction.

**Summary:**  
While terminology was correct, the actual allocations are almost entirely incomplete and often incorrect. The pattern is that the answer gives one role per row, making the RACI matrix drastically oversimplified and misleading compared to ground truth. Each missing assignment (C, A, I) is a point-loss, and the total pattern justifies a very low (but not minimum, since vocabulary was correct) score.

**Hence: 4.0**
