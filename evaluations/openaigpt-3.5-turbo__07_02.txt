**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Added tasks (major errors: -4 points)**: Lists 3 correct tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), but incorrectly adds a 4th hallucinated "Task_AutoApproveLoan" (Task_ApproveLoan exists in *both* v1 and v2 with the *same ID*; only name changed, which is cosmetic and ignored). Uses IDs only vs. ground truth's name-first + ID format.
- **Removed tasks (minor format issue: -0.5 points)**: Correctly identifies Task_RejectLoan (as "Reject Loan"), but uses ID-only vs. name + ID.
- **Gateway-type changes (significant errors: -1.5 points)**: Correctly notes exclusive → inclusive change for Gateway_Decision, but wrongly includes name change ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check") under this heading (cosmetic renaming to ignore; not a *type* change). Lacks ground truth's precise "exclusive (XOR) → inclusive (OR)" phrasing and v1/v2 reference.
- **Overall structure/strictness penalties (-0.5 points)**: Matches exact headings but uses inconsistent numbering/### vs. ground truth's markdown bullets/bolding. No mention of "(No other ... changes)" completeness note. Hallucination and mis-categorization are disqualifying under "utmost strictness"; small format diffs amplify deductions.

Total reflects ~60% alignment with severe penalties for inaccuracies/extras (not zero differences).
