**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision points (major flaws, ~50% deduction)**: Prompt requires summarizing **every** decision point with precise logic/outcomes. Ground truth identifies **exactly 3** (eligibility check *during* triage, amount threshold *after* pre-approve, final approval *at* pre-approve/auditor), including explicit branching (e.g., reject/return, approved→payment, rejected→end). LLM lists 3 but inaccurately: (1) conflates activity with decision without outcomes/rejection; (2) treats pre-approve as decision but misses its approval/rejection role; (3) covers amount branch correctly but omits final approval decision entirely. No rejection paths mentioned. Imprecise locations/timing (e.g., no "during/after/at"). Wrong structure (bulleted list vs. table). Significant incompleteness/imprecision.
- **Required documents (perfect, full credit)**: Exact match to ground truth list (7 items, conditional note on *AuditTrail*). No extras introduced. Includes disclaimer-like phrasing aligning with "no others/legacy."
- **Overall**: Half the response (decisions) critically flawed/missing elements; format deviates; strict penalty for incompleteness, lack of outcomes, and mischaracterization of activities as decisions. No hallucinations, but fails "every" and "summarise" precisely.
