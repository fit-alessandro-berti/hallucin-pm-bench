4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment highlighting multiple critical deviations from the ground truth, including policy violations, incomplete coverage, and factual inaccuracies in RACI assignments. Key issues:

- **Policy Violation (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: The LLM output includes an explanatory note that directly outputs disallowed synonyms ("Preliminary Assessment", "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)", "Sanctions Check", "risk rating"), breaching the STRICT vocabulary policy prohibiting these even in explanations or parentheses. This alone warrants severe penalty.

- **Incomplete Activity Coverage (Major Deduction: -1.5 points)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** from the narrative without merging or adding arbitrarily. The LLM identifies the four authorized activities correctly but merges "escalation/Compliance Officer approval" and "schedule/release funds" into a single "Payment Release" row, omitting a distinct approval step (as in ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval"). This undercovers the process (e.g., no separate handling of escalation/approval), violating "do not rename, merge" while failing to fully address "every activity" (narrative implies distinct approval and release steps). Only 5 rows vs. ground truth's 6.

- **RACI Assignment Errors (Significant Deduction: -1.0 points)**: Multiple cells diverge, often substantially:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst marked "I" (vs. ground truth "C"); no "I" for Treasury Ops; uses "-" instead of "–" (minor formatting but noted under strictness).
  - **KYC Review / AML Screening**: No "I" for Treasury Ops or Front-Office Analyst (vs. ground truth); treats both as identical R/A for Compliance despite narrative sequence.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Compliance Analyst "R/A" (vs. ground truth "R" only, with Officer "A"); Officer "C" (vs. "A"); adds no "C" for Front-Office or "I" for Treasury.
  - **Payment Release** (merged): Compliance "I" (vs. "C" in both ground truth rows); Officer "C" (but misses "R,A" accountability in approval); does not distinguish approval from release, leading to inaccurate holistic assignments.

- **Formatting and Output Excess (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Uses "R/A" shorthand (vs. ground truth's "**R, A**" with bolding); adds unsolicited note (prompt specifies "Return the matrix as a Markdown table" only). Table structure is mostly clean but lacks ground truth's emphasis (e.g., bolded activities/roles).

The LLM correctly uses the four authorized terms in the table itself (partial credit: +1.0 baseline) and maps the core process flow without leaking synonyms into the matrix, but the cumulative errors—especially the policy breach and incomplete/inaccurate coverage—prevent a passing score under utmost strictness. No single aspect fully aligns.
