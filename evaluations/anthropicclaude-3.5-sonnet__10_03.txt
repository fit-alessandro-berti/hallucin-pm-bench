6.0

- **Positive points:**  
  - All four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") appear exactly as required in the matrix.
  - Disallowed synonyms do not appear in the output or explanation.
  - Activities are mapped to the authorized terms.
  - No renaming, merging, or addition of activities.
  - Markdown table format is used.

- **Major issues resulting in point loss:**  
  - The RACI assignments in the LLM answer differ significantly from the ground truth.  
    - **Intake Vetting**: Should be R, A for Front-Office Analyst, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury Ops, not I for Compliance Analyst, nothing for Treasury Ops.  
    - **Risk Scoring**: Accountability assigned incorrectly (should be R for Compliance Analyst, A for Compliance Officer, not R/A both to Compliance Analyst).
    - **Compliance Officer Approval** (or equivalent): This activity is **missing** from the answer, which is a major omission since it is present in the ground truth and process.
    - **Release Funds** vs "Payment Release": Naming discrepancy (though not strictly forbidden, "Release Funds" is preferred per ground truth and "Payment Release" is ambiguous), but more importantly, RACI assignments are inaccurate (should be R, A for Treasury Ops, C Compliance Analyst and Officer, I for Front-Office Analyst).
    - "Consulted" and "Informed" roles are inconsistently or incorrectly applied. For example, Treasury Ops should be I on KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring, but are omitted.
  - Use of "-" for no involvement is inconsistent (should be dash per ground truth, but sometimes cell is just left blank).
  - The answer inappropriately claims "R/A" in multiple rows, even where the ground truth splits these between roles.

- **Other strictness-required deductions:**  
  - The matrix does not cover "Compliance Officer Approval" as a separate activity, directly violating both process narrative and the requirement to "cover every activity".
  - Table entries depart from the ground truth's explicit role assignments.
  - Even small errors in assigning responsibilities (R, A, C, I) are penalized as requested.

**Overall:**  
The answer gets some credit for vocabulary compliance and table structuring, but major errors in activity coverage and RACI assignments significantly reduce the score.
