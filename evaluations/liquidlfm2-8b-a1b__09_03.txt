The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in identifying the impossibility, explaining the data absence (headers only, redacted timestamps/events), and covering all required metrics without guessing. Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., "masked event log" vs. explicit redaction of timestamps; added detail on "lifecycle statuses" which is accurate but expands beyond the ground truth's conciseness) and a touch longer paragraph, though still precise and compliant with the one-paragraph instruction.
