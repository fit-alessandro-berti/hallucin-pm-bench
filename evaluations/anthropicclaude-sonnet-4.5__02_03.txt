9.0

- Q1 matches ground truth closely in content and conciseness.
- Q2 and Q3 are factually correct but include unrequested explanatory details (timestamps and confirmation phrase), violating the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction; this introduces minor deviations from the ground truth format and brevity, warranting a deduction.
