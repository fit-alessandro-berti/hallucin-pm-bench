7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness of Overall Verdict**: The LLM correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" and accurately pinpoints the key violations in Rules 2 and 3, matching the ground truth. This is the core requirement, so no deduction here.
- **Justification for Violations**:
  - Rule 2: Fully accurate—correctly notes `Expedite_Flag` at #4 requires `Risk_Assessment` before `Ship_Goods` (#8), but it occurs after at #9.
  - Rule 3: Accurate identification of the violation, with correct distance calculation (distance=3 > ≤2) based on events #6 to #10 (activities #7, #8, #9 in between).
- **Handling of Non-Violated Rules**:
  - Rules 1 and 5: Not addressed at all. The ground truth systematically evaluates all rules, confirming satisfaction for these. Omission is a notable gap, as the prompt requires a "numbered justification that cites the relevant rules," implying comprehensive coverage.
  - Rule 4: Significant error—initially misstates it as a violation (claiming `Move_to_Quality` #7 by Intern follows `Goods_Received` #6 by Warehouse_Clerk, incorrectly framing it as problematic), then self-corrects. This introduces confusion and inconsistency, even if the final conclusion (no violation) aligns with ground truth. Under strictness, this sloppy reasoning (including the "Correction" addendum) warrants a substantial deduction.
- **Format and Completeness**: Follows the required format but is less structured and thorough than the ground truth (e.g., no explicit check of all rules; includes extraneous self-correction). The response is concise but demonstrates incomplete analysis.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: With utmost strictness, the initial error on Rule 4 and omission of Rules 1/5 represent small but clear flaws in reasoning and completeness, leading to a loss of 2.5 points from a potential 10.0. The accurate core violations prevent a lower score.
