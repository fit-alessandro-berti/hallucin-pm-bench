The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with correct identification of all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). Headings, structure, and formatting (e.g., id followed by name in parentheses, colon spacing in the example format) match verbatim requirements. The only discrepancy is minor inconsistent spacing after the colon in the second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. ground truth's aligned "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"), which under utmost strictness warrants a small deduction for not perfectly replicating the ground truth's presentation.
