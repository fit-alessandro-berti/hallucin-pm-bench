The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, but it does not include the exact, visually aligned formatting for the final required heading ("GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES"), where in the ground truth the second line under that heading aligns the gateway id and change (with extra spaces: "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel") to match the presentation. The LLM collapses the whitespace and omits this alignment. While the substance of the differences is fully captured with precisely correct ids and change types (no omissions or additions in tasks/gateways), the strict instruction to preserve grouping and headings "verbatim" and "in this order" implies that formatting details matter for full marks.  
Thus, the answer receives a significant deduction for not adhering exactly to the format, even though functionally the content is correct.
