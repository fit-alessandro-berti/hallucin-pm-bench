The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (YES), provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, and offers a brief, accurate justification based on the enabling conditions (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0). This directly addresses the prompt's requirements without errors.

However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for differences from the ground truth: (1) lacks the deeper insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 to ever occur (due to the inhibitor arc's permanent effect after T3), (2) omits detailed marking updates after each step in the sequence, (3) provides a shorter sequence without extending to show T3 firing afterward (though not strictly required, this aligns more closely with ground truth), and (4) misses the full explanatory context about p4 never being emptied independently. These omissions reduce completeness relative to the ground truth, warranting a deduction from a perfect score.
