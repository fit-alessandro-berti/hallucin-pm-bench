The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and accurately highlights the key counterexample in case C003 (lines 6-7), with proper citation of timestamps and activities, demonstrating awareness of the "always" requirement being violated by a single instance. However, it incurs significant deductions for incompleteness and a factual error: it misses the additional counterexample in C005 (Validate_Payment in line 11 without any preceding Receive_Order in that case, which further disproves the claim), and erroneously asserts that Validate_Payment "does follow Receive_Order" in C005 without evidence or citation, misreading the log. This omission of a second clear violation and the incorrect statement about C005 represent notable differences from the ground truth, warranting a strict reduction from a perfect score despite the overall structure and partial accuracy.
