**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (full credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times. Quantifies exceedances identically (+300s, +300s, +60s) with precise actual vs. target references grounded in table data. Uses bullets *only* for recommendations. No extraneous activities/metrics invented. Approximate word count (~140 words) aligns with ~150 target.
- **Major deductions (-2.0 total)**:
  - Format/structure differs significantly: Lacks formal memo header (To/From/Subject), bolded activity names, "Recommended actions" header, and closing projection/summary seen in ground truth. Casual tone ("To the COO, our pipeline review") vs. executive polish.
  - Recommendations completely different content (not matching ground truth's specific actions), reducing similarity. LLM's cross-reference other activities' low waits (e.g., Draft Offer's 30s) is creative/data-grounded but mismatched/ambiguous assignment (first bullet unclear for Legal Approval; invents "actual processing" metric absent from table).
- **Minor deductions (-1.0 total)**: No total cases mention (GT invents "4 805" but it's a stylistic match). Abrupt ending without projection. Wording variances (e.g., "steps"/"longest waits" vs. "activities"/"largest queues").
Overall, core analysis matches perfectly (driving high base), but format/content divergences in non-core elements warrant strict penalty per instructions.
