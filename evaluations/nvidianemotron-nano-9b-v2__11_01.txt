7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, rankings, and metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) are accurately identified and ranked by average waiting time from the table. Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim (e.g., 36.5h/120h, 12.2h/44h, 7.8h/16.4h). No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities mentioned. (+10 points base)
- **Format and Constraints**: Structured as a professional memo ≤150 words (149 claimed, verified). Includes appropriate executive elements (To/From/Subject), which aligns with "crisp executive memo" better than the ground truth's bare snippet. No unwarranted content. (+1.5 points)
- **Actions**: Logical and tied to waiting-time issues, promising reductions without fabricating data. However, strict deductions for key shortfalls vs. ground truth:
  - All actions are concrete but lack "data-driven" specificity (e.g., no references to pilots, estimates, or table-derived insights like ground truth's "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%").
  - #1: Solid (explicit ≥20%, specific to bottlenecks). Minimal deduction.
  - #2: Vague ("parallelizing... or optimizing"; "may cut delays" omits explicit ≥20% quantification, weakening the promise). Not strictly "one concrete" action (uses "or").
  - #3: Similar vagueness ("increasing... or implementing"; "could achieve the target" implies but doesn't explicitly state ≥20%). Again, "or" dilutes concreteness.
  These are significant differences in precision and adherence to "data-driven" and "≥20%" requirements, per strict criteria—actions feel generic rather than analytically grounded. (-4 points total)

Overall: High fidelity to core facts and constraints, but action quality shows notable gaps in depth and exactness, justifying deduction from a perfect score.
