The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in substance: both correctly answer "yes," identify the same core shortest sequence (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before any T3, provide accurate marking evolutions for those steps, explain the role of the T2b shortcut bypassing pc/T3, and justify minimality with a lower bound of 4 firings. Minor differences (LLM's sequence stops concisely at 4 steps without unnecessary T6/T3 extension; slightly different phrasing/wording/formatting in explanations and markings; LLM explicitly notes "before any occurrence of T3" while ground truth shows T3 after) do not alter the correctness or proof, warranting only a small deduction under strict criteria.
