The LLM answer closely mirrors the ground truth in structure, precision, and content: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A (headers only, no timestamps or rows), notes the irrelevance of Artefact B's high-level SLAs, explicitly ties the issue to the lack of duration data for “Approve Invoice” computations (average, std dev, CI), and confines the explanation to one short paragraph without guessing or external knowledge. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "observable event data" vs. "concrete times"; explicit listing of statistics vs. "dispersion") do not introduce errors or deviations from the task requirements.
