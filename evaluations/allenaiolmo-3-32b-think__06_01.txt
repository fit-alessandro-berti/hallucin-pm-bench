The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs of tasks that can execute in parallel (Create_Documentation & Quality_Check; Procure_Materials & Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses one pair per line with the em dash separator. This matches the ground truth content and structure perfectly.

However, under utmost strictness, there are small but notable formatting differences:
- Inconsistent spacing around the em dash: LLM uses single spaces (" — "), while ground truth uses two spaces before and after ("  —  ") on the first line and adjusted for alignment on the second.
- No column alignment padding spaces after "Procure_Materials" (ground truth has multiple spaces: "Procure_Materials     —  " to vertically align the em dashes).
- Extraneous double space at the end of the first line in the LLM output.

These whitespace discrepancies deviate from the specified format example (`Task_X  —  Task_Y`, implying precise spacing/alignment as shown in ground truth), warranting a 1.0-point deduction for minor but visible non-exactness.
