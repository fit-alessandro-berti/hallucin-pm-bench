**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Core Correctness (high weight)**: Final conclusion matches ground truth ("Yes, possible"). Provides exact same minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) proving T5 fires before T3. Correctly identifies enabling condition (p3 ≥1 ∧ p4=0) and why p4=0 pre-T3. +9.0 base.
- **Justification Fidelity**: Brief, accurate explanation of markings and inhibitor arc. Notes T3 enabled but not fired. Matches GT's key logic without errors. Minor shortfall: Omits GT's deeper insight ("must fire before T3 if ever; permanently disables after") and fuller sequence (T3/T4 after). -0.5.
- **Sequence Accuracy**: Identical core sequence to GT. Valid markings step-by-step. Stops appropriately (T3 unfired suffices for "before"). No token errors. +1.0.
- **Structure & Clarity (major deductions)**: Severe flaws—opens with **bolded wrong "No"**, internal contradiction ("contradicts our earlier 'no'"), rambling self-correction ("Hold on", "But wait"). Unprofessional, confusing vs. GT's clean/direct format. Significant loss for hesitation/mess. -1.0; small presentation "errors" amplify per strictness.
- **Completeness/Conciseness**: Covers essentials but verbose/repetitive. No extraneous errors (e.g., no invalid firings). GT more precise/elegant. -0.3.
- **Overall Strictness**: 90% alignment (right Yes + sequence + core proof), but mess/presentation drags to high-8s. Tiny GT extras (e.g., "indeed must", extended sequence) not required but highlight gaps. No criminal/low-policy issues.

No lower: Substance correct. No higher: Avoids perfect due to confusion.
