The LLM answer is highly accurate and directly addresses the task: it correctly identifies "No" with precise counterexamples (C002 and C004 sequences) and, for completeness, notes the compliant cases (C001 and C003). This matches the ground truth's conclusion and evidence without factual errors. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's structured table format and exhaustive case-by-case enumeration (though all cases are implicitly covered), which slightly reduces completeness under strict evaluation.
