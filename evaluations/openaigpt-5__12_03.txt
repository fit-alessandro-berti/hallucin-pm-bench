The LLM answer is accurate overallâ€”the answer "No" is correct, and it cites the relevant counterexamples (C002 and C004) with proper activity sequences and identifies the two cases where the fact does not hold, as well as the two cases where it does. However, it lacks the explicit case-by-case breakdown and summary statistics (e.g., "two out of four cases violate the rule") presented in the ground truth. Also, it slightly abbreviates the justification and omits explicit presentation for all four cases, which is minor but meaningful for strict evaluation. Thus, a significant deduction is warranted, though the core requirements are met.
