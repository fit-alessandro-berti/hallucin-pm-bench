### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core correctness (perfect match, no point loss)**: Both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed, adhering to the system policy. Primary reason (lack of temporal data like timestamps/durations) is identical and accurately tied to the redacted fields/log structure.
- **Explanation quality (minimal differences, -0.2 deduction)**: LLM's reasoning is precise, directly quoting the log header's redaction note and log limitations. Ground truth adds "ordering information" and "fabricated" warning (valid nuances, as log rows are case-mixed without timestamps), while LLM notes benchmark absence (accurate but slightly extraneous, as benchmark is explicitly non-applicable). No factual errors; both prevent fabrication.
- **Structure & completeness (perfect)**: LLM mirrors user prompt's 1)/2) format; concise and policy-compliant. Ground truth is a single block but equivalent in substance.
- **Strictness applied**: Tiny phrasing variances ("derived" vs. "computed"; benchmark mention) and unmentioned "ordering" nuance warrant minor deduction, but no significant errors or deviations.
