The LLM answer correctly identifies that the value cannot be derived and provides a brief, accurate explanation aligned with the system's instructions and the prompt's constraints. It structures the response to match the user's numbered questions and focuses precisely on the absence of temporal data needed for cycle time. Minor deductions for slight wording differences from the ground truth (e.g., "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; omission of "ordering information" and the explicit warning against fabrication, though the latter is implied), which introduce negligible but present variances under strict evaluation.
