The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with the exact tasks in each, adhering to the prompt's requirements for enumeration and exclusivity to concurrent sets. Minor deductions for formatting inconsistencies: unnecessary backslash escaping (e.g., Generate\_CAD\_Drawing vs. Generate_CAD_Drawing) and inconsistent spacing after commas (e.g., no space after first comma in line 1), which deviate from the ground truth's precise punctuation and whitespace. These small textual differences warrant a slight penalty under strict evaluation, but the substantive content is a near-perfect match.
