9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1**: Correct count (1), but verbose phrasing vs. ground truth's concise "`1` occurrence". Minor deviation in format/wording: -0.3 points.
- **Q2**: Exact match on "5.56%" and includes correct calculation (matches ground truth). Perfect: +2.5 points.
- **Q3**: Correct identifier (**A1002**), but phrasing omits "only" and full context ("contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”"); slightly less precise: -0.3 points.
- **Q4**: First reason ("Very small sample size") matches ground truth exactly in concept and is well-stated/illustrated. Second reason ("Potential selection bias") validly covers "temporal bias" (single day explicitly noted in log) and aligns with "case-mix bias" intent, stated clearly. However, factual error calling events "18 orders" (actual: 4 cases/orders, 18 *events*) is a clear misread of log, violating "only ground-truth data" rule; "special promotion" is a minor unjustified hypothetical. Significant deduction: -1.2 points total for Q4.

**Overall**: Excellent fidelity (98% alignment), all answers derived solely from log, no hallucinations beyond noted slips. Base 10.0 minus 1.8 for strict penalties on small-but-clear errors (verbosity, phrasing, factual miscount).
