The LLM answer is correct in concluding that the calculation is impossible due to the absence of timestamps. However, it is less explicit and detailed than the ground truth, omitting the point that only event counts were provided and failing to mention specifically that start-to-completion intervals are absent. The answer is accurate and concise but loses a full point for not referencing the lack of interval information and briefly explaining what piece of information is missing for the calculation.
