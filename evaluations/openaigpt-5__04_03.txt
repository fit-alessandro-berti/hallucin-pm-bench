The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No"), accurately assesses all four rules with no factual errors or deviations from the ground truth (e.g., same satisfied/violated status for each rule, equivalent reasoning on the key violation in Rule 3 regarding NA's timing relative to QE and RA, and proper handling of high severity for Rule 2 and VP for Rule 4). Minor stylistic differences (bullet points vs. table format, slight phrasing variations) do not impact correctness or completeness, aligning fully with the prompt's requirements for a short justification referencing each rule.
