4.2

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment based on fidelity to the prompt, vocabulary policy, process narrative, and ground truth answer. The LLM answer shows partial adherence but incurs major deductions for additions, inaccuracies, and deviations. Breakdown of key differences (with point losses):

- **Vocabulary Compliance (full credit, no deduction)**: Correctly uses exactly the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks. No disallowed terms appear.

- **Activities Coverage and Integrity (major deduction: -4.0)**: 
  - Covers the core four activities but adds unauthorized rows: "Approval (Risk ≤ 70)", "Approval (Risk > 70)", "Fund Release", "Notification to Originating Analyst". This violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities".
  - Renames "Release Funds" (per ground truth/process) to "Fund Release" and splits "Compliance Officer Approval" into two conditional rows, altering the structure. Ground truth consolidates approval into one row and omits notification as a separate activity (it's implied in the narrative but not explicitly an "activity").
  - Fails to cover "every activity... described above" precisely, as the process narrative implies a single approval step (escalation for >70; otherwise direct to Treasury) and fund release/notification as a unified post-approval action.

- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -2.5)**:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Missing "A" for Front-Office Analyst; omits "C" for Compliance Analyst; empty cells instead of dashes (–) for non-involvement. (Ground: Front R,A; Comp Analyst C; Officer –; Treasury I)
  - **KYC Review**: Incorrect "C" for Front-Office Analyst (should be –); missing "A" for Compliance Analyst; omits "C" for Compliance Officer. (Ground: –; R,A; C; I)
  - **AML Screening**: Same errors as KYC (wrong "C" for Front; missing "A" for Comp Analyst and "C" for Officer). (Ground: –; R,A; C; I)
  - **Risk Scoring**: Matches ground truth exactly (C; R; A; I). Minor positive.
  - Added rows have fabricated assignments not aligned with ground truth or narrative (e.g., Treasury as R,A for ≤70 approval, which isn't described; Notification row invented with Officer "C" and Treasury R,A, unsupported).

- **Format and Output Structure (deduction: -0.8)**:
  - Markdown table is present, but uses empty cells instead of dashes (–) for no involvement, violating ground truth style.
  - Bold formatting (**R**) is inconsistent with ground truth's **R, A** (combined where applicable).
  - Adds unauthorized title ("# NimbusPay Wire-Transfer Process – RACI Matrix") and a separate "Key" section, bloating the output beyond "Return the matrix as a Markdown table".
  - Activities not bolded as in ground truth; column headers match but overall presentation deviates.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt and Narrative (additional deduction: -0.5)**: Interprets the conditional approval and notification as separate activities/roles, but prompt requires strict adherence without expansion. Ground truth provides a cleaner, non-split mapping that directly derives from the narrative without invention.

Total: Starts at 10.0; deductions sum to -7.8, yielding 4.2. The answer is partially useful for the core activities but undermined by additions and errors, making it unreliable against the ground truth. Even small format inconsistencies (e.g., no dashes) contribute significantly under strict criteria.
