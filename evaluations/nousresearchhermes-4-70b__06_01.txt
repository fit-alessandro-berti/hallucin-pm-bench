The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, structure, ordering (alphabetical within pairs and overall), and format (one pair per line with the specified delimiter). Minor potential differences in whitespace alignment (e.g., indentation in the ground truth's second line) do not constitute errors, as the task does not specify rigid spacing beyond the basic format. No extraneous pairs or omissions are present.
