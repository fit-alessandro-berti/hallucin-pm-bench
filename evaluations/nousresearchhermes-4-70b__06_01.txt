The LLM answer lists the correct pairs, with the correct alphabetical order *within* each pair. However, it omits the required alignment in pair *formatting* — specifically, it does not preserve the consistent spacing with the em dash as in the ground truth (`Task_X     —  Task_Y` with multiple spaces before the dash). The ground truth also requests output in a code block with backticks, which is not present in the LLM answer. 

While the semantic answer is entirely correct, small formatting differences (missing extra spaces and code block) must result in a significant deduction as per instructions.

**Deductions:**  
- Missing code block: -0.5  
- Missing extra spaces before the dash: -0.3  
- Minor formatting polish: -0.2

**Total:** 9.0
