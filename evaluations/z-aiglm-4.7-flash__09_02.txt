The LLM answer is correct, concise, and directly addresses the impossibility due to missing timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning (no timestamps/event counts only, absent start-completion data). Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing ("duration" vs. "average cycle time"; omits explicit activity reference and "start-to-completion intervals"); semantically equivalent but not verbatim under utmost strictness.
