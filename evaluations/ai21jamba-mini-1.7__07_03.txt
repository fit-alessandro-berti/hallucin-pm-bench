3.0

The LLM answer is well-structured and closely follows the required format (with the minor, but notable, exception of using JSON rather than the specified headings), and all listed changes are correct. However, there are two significant omissions and a format deviation:

- Under REMOVED TASKS, it fails to mention Task_ManualReview (Manual Review), which was present in v1 and removed in v2.
- Under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, it omits Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel, which is a required difference present in the ground truth.
- The answer wraps its response in a JSON object. While the required headings are present as keys, the prompt requested a specific textual presentation ("the three headings shown below — verbatim and in this order"), so this counts as a format error.

Given these significant omissions and the (lesser, but still penalizing) formatting deviation, the score must be penalized heavily despite the otherwise mostly correct content.
