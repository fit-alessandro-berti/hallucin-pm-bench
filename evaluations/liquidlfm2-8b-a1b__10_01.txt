### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Policy Adherence (Major Violation - 0/10)**: The prompt mandates **strict** use of “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” as exact replacements, with no mention of forbidden terms (“Customer Due Diligence”, “Order Validation”, “Payment Processing”) under any circumstances. The LLM answer uses all three forbidden terms verbatim in the activity rows, failing to substitute even one mandated synonym. This is a complete and intentional disregard of the core instruction, warranting maximum point deduction.
  
- **RACI Allocations and Correctness (Major Violation - 0/10)**: The ground truth reflects the process narrative with standard RACI (R=Responsible, A=Accountable, C=Consulted, I=Informed), one primary Responsible per activity, and Account Manager as Accountable (often combined as R/A) where appropriate (e.g., Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer). The LLM uses non-standard, invented notations (RR for "Responsible primary", | for Accountable, P for "Provide" which isn't in standard RACI). Allocations do not match the narrative (e.g., Finance Clerk as R for Payment Processing with wrong term; no C/I distinctions; multiple inconsistencies like CO as R for a non-CO activity). No activity has exactly one Responsible as per notes.

- **Format and Structure (Partial Credit - 3/10)**: Basic table structure with activities as rows and roles as columns is present, using correct role abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT). However, headers use abbreviations instead of full names as in ground truth; no bolding or combined notations (e.g., R/A); introduces unwarranted legend with errors (e.g., | symbol unused in table, "P=Provide" irrelevant). No extra tasks/roles, but the legend adds unwarranted, confusing content.

- **Unwarranted Content (Violation - 0/10)**: The custom legend introduces non-standard elements ("RR", "P=Provide") not in the prompt or standard RACI, bloating the response without justification. Forbidden terms are not just errors but explicitly prohibited "even in brackets or quotes."

- **Overall Fidelity to Ground Truth (Minimal Overlap - 1/10)**: Only superficial matches (e.g., some Rs in roughly correct columns like IT for Record Update). All key differences (terminology, allocations, format) compound to make this unrecognizable from the ground truth. Strictness applied: Even one vocabulary error would deduct heavily; three plus format/RACI failures = minimum score.

This answer fails core requirements, providing no usable value for the prompt's intent.
