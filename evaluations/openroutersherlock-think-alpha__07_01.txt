### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the core requirements of the prompt. However, under strict evaluation, several significant deviations from the ground truth and prompt instructions reduce the score:

- **Headings mismatch**: The prompt specifies exact headings like "• Added tasks" (with bullet). The LLM uses "### Added tasks" (Markdown headers without bullets), deviating from the required format. Ground truth uses "**Added tasks**" (bold), but the LLM's choice is not exact.
  
- **Task descriptions incomplete**: The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," which refers to the `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" for check_vip). The LLM lists only IDs (e.g., "check_vip"), omitting names entirely. Ground truth includes full names with IDs (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)*"), making the LLM's output factually incomplete and less precise. This is a major error, as it ignores explicit XML content.

- **Removed tasks formatting**: Similar issue—LLM uses only the ID ("send_rma_label"), while ground truth provides the name ("Send RMA Label") with ID. Consistent failure to use names.

- **Gateway type changes phrasing**: The LLM's concise "(exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway)" captures the essence but lacks the ground truth's detailed structure ("changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), including version references and bolding. It also omits backticks around the ID (`gw_valid`). While not speculative, it's less comprehensive.

- **Minor stylistic differences**: Bullets (• vs. *), lack of final note "(No other differences should be reported.)" (present in ground truth but not required), and no speculation (good). No "(none)" needed, so neutral.

These errors, especially omitting names, represent clear non-compliance with "use the element names exactly" and exact headings, warranting a significant deduction despite correct identification of changes. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, factual accuracy is ~80% but format/detail fidelity is ~50%, averaging to 6.5 under utmost strictness.
