The LLM answer correctly identifies the core facts (3 cases: C123/C456/C789; predecessor: Pack_Items; unique activity: Cancel_Order) but fails strict criteria on multiple fronts: (1) violates "concise, bullet-point answers only" with excessive, rambling reasoning (over 500 words of analysis instead of direct output); (2) third bullet is malformed/incomplete ("(cancel order)" vs. "Cancel_Order", with spelling error and no capitalization/underscore); (3) bullets include extra phrasing (e.g., "the activity before" vs. exact "immediately precedes"); (4) minor spelling error in analysis ("Cancle"); (5) case list order differs slightly (non-issue but contributes to non-exact match). These deviations from ground truth's clean, precise format warrant significant deduction despite factual accuracy.
