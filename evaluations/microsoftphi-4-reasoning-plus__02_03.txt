7.0

- The LLM answer has the correct facts for all three questions.
- It identifies the three distinct cases ("C456", "C123", "C789")â€”correct.
- Correctly states that for "C456", the activity preceding "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items".
- Correctly identifies "Cancel_Order" as the only activity appearing exactly once.

**Point deductions for the following reasons:**
- The answer is not as concise as required by the instructions ("Give concise, bullet-point answers only"). Instead, it includes both a long, detailed reasoning section and output at the end.
- The final answer section isn't formatted ideally; bullets are a mix of sentences and not aligned to the expected answer structure.
- Some unnecessary information is included (such as mentioning timestamps, and parenthetical information).
- Formatting could be cleaner and more direct. The ground truth is much more terse ("Pack_Items"; the LLM says 'the activity before "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items"' and gives an extra parenthetical about time).

In summary, while the core information is correct, deductions are for verbosity, lack of maximum conciseness, and formatting. Small errors in format and style per the instructions warrant a loss of 3 points.
