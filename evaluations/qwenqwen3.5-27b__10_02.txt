**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Structural differences (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: LLM uses only 2 columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison), omitting Operations Manager and IT Support present in ground truth. Headers differ ("Process Task" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"). No bolding on R/A/C/I cells as in ground truth.
- **Task wording mismatches (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: 3/6 tasks differ notably ("Log Transfer Instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Release Payment & Transmit SWIFT Message" vs. "Release Payment" — improper combination; "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record"). Screening task close but not identical.
- **RACI assignments inaccurate (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: No task has fully matching assignments even on overlapping columns. Examples:
  | Task (approx.) | LLM (TA/RL) | Ground (TA/RL only) | Match? |
  |----------------|-------------|----------------------|--------|
  | Receive/Log   | R,A / I    | R / I               | Partial (extra A) |
  | Screen        | R,A / C    | R / A               | No     |
  | KYC Review    | C / R,A    | C / R               | Partial (extra A) |
  | Approve       | I / R,A    | C / R               | No     |
  | Release       | R,A / I    | R / I               | Partial (extra A, combined) |
  | Archive       | R,A / I    | C / I               | No     |
- **Vocabulary/mandate partial compliance (minor credit but deduction: no net gain)**: Correctly uses “KYC Review” (bolded), “Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”; avoids forbidden terms. However, fails to incorporate all source elements (e.g., IT Support tasks mapped incorrectly or omitted).
- **Other (minor deductions: -0.5 points)**: Legend/Key wording/position differs; no omissions but incomplete coverage of source roles/tasks.
- **Base (partial credit for format/effort)**: Markdown table present, covers 6 steps, clear organization (+3.0 starting point).

Total reflects utmost strictness: substantial deviations in structure, content, and precision justify low score despite basic compliance.
