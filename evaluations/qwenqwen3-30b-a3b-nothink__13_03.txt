4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1 Accuracy**: The LLM correctly identifies the exact count (1 occurrence) and references the case, aligning with ground truth. No errors here, but minor verbosity slightly dilutes precision (full credit: 5/5).
- **Q2 Depth and Fidelity**: The response is under 120 words but superficial and generic, focusing only on basic sampling underrepresentation without quantifying the snippet's limitations (e.g., 14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours; frequency swing from 0% to 7%; wide confidence intervals; sampling error for rare events). It entirely omits critical discussion of string-matching pitfalls (e.g., near-synonyms like “Automatic Fraud Check” or “Fraud Check (Automatic)”, strict vs. fuzzy matching risks). This results in a vague explanation far short of ground truth's analytical rigor, warranting major deduction (1/5).
- **Overall**: Strict assessment penalizes incomplete coverage of ground truth insights, leading to low congruence despite brevity and no overt errors.
