8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: Correctly identifies the three core decision points (eligibility validation, pre-approval, high-value branch), matching the ground truth's count and essence. Lists **all required documents** identically (7 items, with accurate conditional note on *AuditTrail*). No introductions of undefined activities/artefacts. Faithful to process description without extras like legacy activities.
- **Weaknesses (deducting 2.0 points)**: 
  - Decision point summaries lack explicit **branching logic/outcomes** (e.g., no "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → reject" or "Approved → payment; Rejected → ends"), which ground truth details precisely—major omission under strictness for completeness.
  - Frames decisions as **activity descriptions** rather than abstracted "decision points" (e.g., "*Eligibility check* during..." vs. LLM's activity-focused blurbs), reducing precision.
  - No structured table for decisions or final disclaimer note, making it less comprehensive/matching in format/content depth.
  - Minor: Describes triage as cross-checking "*RefundRequestForm*" explicitly (not in process wording; it's "claim"), though negligible.

Overall, strong alignment (~80% match) but strict penalties for missing outcome details and less rigorous summarization lower from 10.0.
