10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content, factual accuracy, sequencing, and alphabetical ordering for all questions. Minor formatting variations (e.g., bullet styles in Q3, escaped underscores in ground truth A2 vs. plain text in LLM) do not constitute errors, as the core responses are identical and adhere to the prompt's requirements without any additions, omissions, or fabrications.
