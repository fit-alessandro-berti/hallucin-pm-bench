**Score: 9.0**

Evaluation:

- Q1: Correct ("3 distinct cases (C001, C002, and C003)") – matches ground truth.  
- Q2: Correct sequence ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order") – matches exactly with ground truth.
- Q3: Content is correct ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock") and alphabetized.  
  However, the LLM omits the use of underscores in activity names ("Arrange_Delivery" vs "Arrange\_Delivery"), despite the prompt (and event log) using underscores consistently in activity names.

**Deduction:**  
The absence of underscores in Q3 activity names is a small, but concrete formatting mistake, since exact naming and formatting were expected per the prompt and log fragment. This warrants a loss of 1 full point, as strict adherence was required.

**No major factual errors or hallucinations; only minor formatting issue.**

**Final score: 9.0**
