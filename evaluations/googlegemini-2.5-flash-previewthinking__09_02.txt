**Score: 8.0**

**Justification:**  
The LLM answer is fundamentally correct: it concisely and directly states the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the lack of timestamp or duration data. However, compared to the ground truth answer, it is slightly less explicit. The ground truth clarifies that only event counts are provided, and that the start-to-completion interval (cycle time) specifically cannot be computed.

**Errors/Deficiencies:**  
- The LLM answer does not mention that only event counts are provided.
- It could be clearer that the cycle time between "start" and "complete" specifically cannot be computed.
- The explanation is somewhat generic compared to the ground truth, which ties directly to the supplied artefacts.

**Summary:**  
The answer is concise and correct but lacks the informative detail linking the missing data to the question’s requirement (start-to-completion cycle time for “Dual Authorization”) and does not explicitly reference the event counts. This results in a moderate (~2 point) deduction for slight lack of completeness and specificity.
