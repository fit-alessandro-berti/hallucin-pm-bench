7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correctly identifies all factual changes: added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, and `gw_valid` type change from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`. Matches exact headings from prompt (• Added tasks, etc.). No extras or speculation. Concise.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Uses **ids only** (`check_vip`, etc.) instead of **names** (`Check Customer VIP Status`, etc.) as primary identifiers for tasks, differing substantially from ground truth (which lists full names with ids in `id = \`...\`` format). This violates "element names exactly as they appear" (names are explicitly in XML `name=` attributes; ids alone miss this).
  - List formatting mismatch: plain newlines vs ground truth's `*` bullets and structured `(id = ...)` parentheticals.
  - Gateway description less precise: misses `(v1)` and `(v2)` versioning explicitly noted in ground truth.
  - No matching markdown (**, `, *) or final note, leading to textual divergence.
- Overall: Semantically accurate (10/10 facts), but presentation/details differ notably from ground truth (-3.0 points total for omissions and format under utmost strictness).
