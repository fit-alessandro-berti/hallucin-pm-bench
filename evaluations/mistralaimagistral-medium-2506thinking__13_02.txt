- Q1: Correct ("1 time")
- Q2a: Correct (2.08% for events)
- Q2b: Correct (8.33% for cases)
- Q3: The answer gives sound reasoning that matches the ground truth: it notes the rarity, provides correct percentages, speaks to both performance and predictive impacts, and warns against generalization. However, it does not precisely mention that the statistic is based on only one case/event, nor does it discuss instability/variance/confidence intervals quite as directly as the ground truth expects. This omission, although minor, is meaningful for strict evaluation. Therefore, 1 point is deducted due to the small but real lack of technical depth and completeness in Q3.
