### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Perfect match (1 time). No issues.
- **Q2a/b**: Exact match (2.08%, 8.33%) with correct calculation and rounding. No issues.
- **Q3**: Partial match. It correctly identifies low support (implying the single occurrence via percentages) and cautions against over-generalization. However, it fails to explicitly mention the "single-occurrence issue" or emphasize variance/instability (e.g., noise skewing statistics, wide confidence intervals from one data point), which are core requirements. The explanation is generic on low support rather than tied to analytical unreliability from limited data, introducing minor inaccuracies (e.g., "overrepresenting impact" contradicts typical underrepresentation risks). Word count is compliant (â‰¤100), but content shortfall warrants deduction. The response structure is redundant (duplicate boxed sections), adding minor clutter.

Overall, strong on deterministic elements but strict deduction for Q3's incomplete alignment with ground truth specifics.
