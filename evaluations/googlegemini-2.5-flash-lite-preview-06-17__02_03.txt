- The LLM answer provides the correct direct answers: 3; Pack_Items; Cancel_Order.
- However, for Q1 ("How many distinct cases"): the answer "3" was given instead of the more explicit "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" as in the ground truth. The requirement to be concise was fulfilled, but a small loss of points is warranted since the explicit unique values were not stated as in the ground truth.
- For Q2 and Q3, the answers are exact.
- The LLM's formatting (bullets, concise, no extra explanation) matches the instructions, but omitting the explicit listing of unique cases is a minor deviation.

Strict application of guidelines: Deduct 1 point for not listing distinct case values; otherwise, the answer is perfect.
