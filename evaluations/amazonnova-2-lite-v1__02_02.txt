The LLM answer is factually precise and fully matches the ground truth across all questions:

- **Q1/A1**: Exact match ("3").
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order").
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock"), listed one per line and alphabetically ordered.

No missing, extra, fabricated, or erroneous elements in the core answers. Explanatory reasoning is accurate, non-hallucinated, and supplementary (not penalized as it does not alter factual precision). Minor formatting variations (e.g., bolding, backticks, code block) do not deviate from the required content or structure.
