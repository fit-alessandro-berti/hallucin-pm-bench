The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key failures include:

- **Added unauthorized activities**: Introduces two extra rows ("Schedule the payment" and "Notify the originating analyst") not present in the ground truth, violating the instruction to not add activities. This alone merits severe deduction.
- **Renamed activities**: Uses "Compliance Officer approval" (lowercase, no bold) instead of "**Compliance Officer Approval**"; "Release the funds" instead of "**Release Funds**". These are not exact matches and alter the structure.
- **Incorrect RACI assignments**: Nearly every cell differs. For example:
  - Intake Vetting: LLM assigns only Front-Office Analyst (R, A) with empties; ground truth has Front-Office (R, A), Compliance Analyst (C), Treasury Ops (I), Compliance Officer (–).
  - KYC Review and AML Screening: LLM assigns only Compliance Analyst (R, A); ground truth includes Compliance Officer (C) and Treasury Ops (I).
  - Risk Scoring: LLM assigns only Compliance Analyst (R, A); ground truth has Compliance Analyst (R), Compliance Officer (A), Front-Office Analyst (C), Treasury Ops (I).
  - Compliance Officer Approval: LLM assigns only Compliance Officer (R, A); ground truth includes Compliance Analyst (C) and Front-Office Analyst (I).
  - Release Funds: LLM assigns only Treasury Ops (R, A); ground truth includes Compliance Analyst (C), Compliance Officer (C), and Front-Office Analyst (I).
  - No coverage for multi-role involvement (e.g., C and I) beyond one instance, ignoring the process narrative's implied consultations and notifications.
- **Formatting errors**: Lacks bolding on activities and key cells (e.g., **R, A**); uses empty cells instead of dashes (–) for no involvement; inconsistent spacing and capitalization in headers/rows compared to ground truth.
- **Incomplete coverage**: Fails to address "every activity and role" with the nuanced RACI from the narrative (e.g., escalation implies Officer accountability for Risk Scoring; notifications imply Informed roles). The four mandated terms appear correctly but are undermined by the overall mismatch.
- **Vocabulary adherence**: While the four core terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) are used exactly, the additions and renamings introduce non-standard phrasings, indirectly violating the "do not rename" rule.

Even minor discrepancies (e.g., no bolding, empties vs. –) compound the major structural and content errors, resulting in no meaningful alignment with the ground truth matrix.
