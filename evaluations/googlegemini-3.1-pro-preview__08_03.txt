**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" via the T2b shortcut and provides an accurate trace for firing T5 without prior T3 (matching the critical prefix of the ground truth), but it fails significantly on key requirements:
- Provides a 4-step sequence lacking T3 entirely, which does not demonstrate "T5 before T3" (requiring both in sequence per ground truth interpretation); ground truth uses 6 steps including T6-T3.
- Incorrectly claims the 4-step as "**shortest** firing sequence achieving this" (ignores lower bound argument and need for loop to enable post-T5 T3).
- Omits explanation of feedback loop (T6), why T3 is possible after, and minimality proof.
- Minor extras (concurrency note) are irrelevant/unmatched.

These are major structural/interpretive differences (wrong sequence, length, no full order demo, missing core reasoning), warranting substantial deduction despite partial overlap.
