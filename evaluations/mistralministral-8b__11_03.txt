6.0

- The LLM correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches and high waiting time: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment, as in the ground truth.
- It quantifies by how much each activity exceeds its SLA, with correct values for Risk Review (+300 s) and Credit Assessment (+60 s), but is incorrect for Legal Approval ("1800 seconds - 600 seconds target SLA" = 1200 s, and uses 180 s as the breach; the correct overage is +300 s).
- The recommendations are more generic and less data-driven or concrete than the ground truth, which featured very specific, actionable interventions (e.g., “Introduce rule-based pre-checks,” “add one risk analyst,” “deploy a ‘straight-through’ heuristic for loans under €25k”).
- Some recommendations (e.g., “provide additional training”) are not directly grounded in the table data and could be considered invented or too vague, leading to point deductions per strict assessment instructions.
- The LLM incorrectly restates the calculation for Legal Approval (uses the wrong numbers and units).
- The overall wording is less data-rich—there is no reference to the 4805 cases handled, no concrete % benefit from recommendations, and less precision in language compared to the ground truth.
- The memo includes extraneous closing lines ("Please review...") and unnecessary address lines not requested.

Given these discrepancies—especially the errors in quantification, less data-grounded recommendations, and lack of specificity—I am deducting substantial points while recognizing that the main activities, structure, and intent are mostly correct.
