3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Identification of Activities (Strong Match, +2.0):** Correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times, aligning precisely with the ground truth.
- **Quantification of SLA Exceeds (Partial Match with Critical Error, +0.5):** Correctly quantifies excesses for Risk Review (+300 s) and Credit Assessment (+60 s), including waiting times. However, Legal Approval is severely misrepresented as +180 s based on an invented 1800 s throughput (actual data: 900 s - 600 s = +300 s). This fabrication violates the "ground in data; do NOT invent" rule and mismatches ground truth's +300 s, warranting major deduction.
- **Recommendations (Poor Match, +0.5):** Uses bullet points as required, but actions are generic and not data-driven (e.g., "dedicated legal review team" lacks data grounding like case volumes or times; no specifics like ground truth's "low-risk bypass" or "add one analyst"). Fails to tie to provided metrics (e.g., cases, waiting times), making them non-concrete.
- **Overall Structure, Style, and Compliance (Weak Match, +0.5):** Memo format is present but bloated (~220 words vs. ~150 target) with extraneous elements (e.g., "Dear COO," signature, polite closing) not in ground truth's concise "only memo text." Subject differs; no total cases mention (ground truth calculates/infers 4,805 from data). Intro/list style diverges from ground truth's paragraph + bolded entries. No invented activities/metrics beyond the 1800 s error, but overall ungrounded tone.
- **Strictness Adjustments (-5.0 total):** Factual invention (1800 s) and vague recommendations are small-but-significant errors per instructions, plus non-adherence to "only memo text" and word limit, leading to substantial loss. Ground truth is precise, data-anchored, and projective; LLM is superficial.
