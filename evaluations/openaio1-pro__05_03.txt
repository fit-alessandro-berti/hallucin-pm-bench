8.0

The LLM answer is generally correct:  
- It adds an interrupting boundary timer event with a time duration of PT48H attached to Activity_CreateAccount.
- The timer triggers a sequence flow to the already existing escalation task Activity_AMReview.
- The one-sentence justification correctly states the mechanism and purpose.

Notable differences/imperfections:
- The ID of the boundary event and the sequence flow do not match the naming style of the ground truth (BoundaryEvent_SLA_01 vs. Boundary_LateCreate, Flow_SLA_Escalation vs. Flow_LateEscalation). Unique, descriptive and process-consistent IDs are preferred for clarity and maintainability. This is a significant but not severe loss of rigor.
- The boundary event is missing a human-friendly "name" attribute (e.g., name="48h breach"), as present in the ground truth.
- The justification is clear, but does not explicitly highlight not adding new activities (which the ground truth does), nor the precise "48-hour" naming in the escalation.

These differences reflect small but meaningful losses in precision and best-practice execution; thus, a strict score of 8.0 is given.
