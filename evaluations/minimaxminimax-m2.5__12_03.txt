The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, structure adherence (Yes/No + justification citing exact CaseIDs and sequences), and conclusion. It correctly identifies the same compliant cases (C001, C003) and violations (C002: Pack_Items intervenes; C004: Check_Fraud intervenes), proving "always" false. Inclusion of timestamps is accurate extra detail from the log (no error). Differences are only stylistic (list vs. table); no errors, omissions, or inaccuracies under utmost strictness.
