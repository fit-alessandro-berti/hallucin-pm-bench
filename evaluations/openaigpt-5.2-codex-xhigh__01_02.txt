9.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high base score)**: Correctly identifies **all 3 decision points** (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)) with accurate logic, conditions (≤2 points difference, <€15k auto-approve, ≥€15k to MBA, board approve/reject), and exact activity names/terminology. Lists **all 6 required documents** in exact prompt order and closely matching phrasing (e.g., "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template", "(≤ 3 months old)"). No introductions of forbidden standard loan terms. Content fidelity to prompt is excellent.
- **Differences/Deductions (1.0 point loss total, significant per strictness rule)**:
  - **Decision points (0.5 deduction)**: Misses contextual positions ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). Phrasing less concise (*If... ⇒ ...* vs. bullet details). Headers add extraneous "(using exact activity names)" not in GT. MBA listed separately but referenced in Threshold (minor redundancy, matches logic).
  - **Documents (0.3 deduction)**: Exact to prompt but differs from GT's abbreviations (e.g., extra "old", "single ... or", "template"; "pay‑stub" hyphen vs "/"). Headers add "(every item)" vs GT "(complete list)". Misses GT's extra disclaiming note.
  - **Formatting/Style (0.2 deduction)**: Bold/italics/bullets vs GT's #### headers, numbered lists, *⇒* symbols, capitalization (**Approve**/**Reject**). Minor but visible diffs.
- **Overall**: Near-perfect content match (no omissions/additions/errors), but strict phrasing/structure/context diffs prevent 10.0. Equivalent to ~90% identical under pixel-perfect comparison.
