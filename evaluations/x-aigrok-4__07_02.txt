8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (9.5/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), the single removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change (from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision). No extraneous changes are listed, aligning with the ground truth's confirmation of no others. Minor deduction for omitting explicit version references (v1/v2) and semantic abbreviations (XOR/OR) in the gateway description, which provide clearer context in the ground truth.
- **Structure and Headings (9.0/10)**: Headings match exactly as required ("Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway-type changes..."). Grouping is precise. Deduction for using bullet points (-) instead of numbered lists (1., 2., 3.), which alters the presentation from the ground truth.
- **Detail and Formatting (7.5/10)**: Task listings reverse the ground truth's order (ID first vs. name first in bold with backticks for ID). No bolding, backticks, or italicized version markers (e.g., *v1*, *v2*). Missing the ground truth's closing note affirming no other changes. These are small but consistent formatting/verbosity differences, warranting significant deduction per strict criteria.
- **Overall Strictness**: Substance is nearly identical (high fidelity to changes), but stylistic and minor descriptive variances prevent a perfect score. No critical errors like missing changes or hallucinations.
