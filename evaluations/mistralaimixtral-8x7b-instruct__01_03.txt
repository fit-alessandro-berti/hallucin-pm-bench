**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part a) (Decision Points)**: Major structural and content failures. Ground truth identifies **exactly 2 decision points** with precise one-sentence rules. LLM incorrectly lists **8 items** (treating sequential steps as "decision points"), invents spurious conditions (e.g., "If the application is approved" before Prepare-Binding-Offer, not in process), rephrases rules imprecisely (e.g., "must approve" vs. ground truth's "record 'Approve'"; logical equivalence in skip condition buried incorrectly), and truncates the final step. Partial credit for embedding the two actual rules somewhat accurately, but format, completeness, and fidelity to "every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch)" are severely violated (-6.0 equivalent loss).
- **Part b) (Documents)**: **Completely absent**. Ground truth lists 9 items in first-appearance order (including distinguishing Signed Offer Sheet 77 from unsigned). LLM provides no list at all, despite scorecards being inputs/documents and explicit ordering required (-4.0 loss).
- **Overall**: ~80% deviation (wrong count/structure in a, 100% miss in b, extras/hallucinations like "underwriter" role, truncation). No KYC/AML hallucination (minor plus), but strictness demands near-perfect match; small errors alone cost big, this is wholesale failure. Total: 2.0 (minimal credit for partial rule recall).
