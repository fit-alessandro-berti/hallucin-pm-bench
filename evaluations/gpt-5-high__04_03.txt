The LLM answer correctly identifies the non-compliance ("No") and provides an accurate, concise justification for each rule, matching the ground truth on all factual assessments (satisfied for Rules 1, 2, and 4; violated for Rule 3 with the same core reasoning about NA preceding RA). Minor deductions for slight phrasing variations (e.g., not using a table format or bolding emphasis) and lacking an explicit overall summary sentence, though these do not introduce errors or deviate from the prompt's requirements.
