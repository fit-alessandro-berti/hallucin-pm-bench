9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely mirrors the gold standard. It:

- Correctly answers "No" (not compliant).
- Accurately addresses all four rules, specifying for each if it is satisfied or violated.
- Correctly points out that Rule 3 is violated because NA occurs before RA.

Minor deductions:
- The gold standard answer's justifications are slightly more detailed and clearly formatted (e.g., explicit table, more explicit notation for violation).
- The LLM answer could have been marginally more precise, for example, by directly stating that Rule 3 is "violated" (though it does so), and using explicit icons or language as in the gold standard ("✔", "❌"), but this is a formatting nuance.

No content errors were made.

Given the requirement for utmost strictness, the lack of full formatting and slightly less explicit language about the violation lose half a point.

Final score: **9.5**
