The LLM answer contains all the necessary factual information, accurately listing all added and removed tasks, as well as both gateway type changes, matching the ground truth. However, there are formatting errors:

- The output uses bullets and backticks for ids, whereas the ground truth uses hyphens and parentheses, as well as aligned colons and indentation.
- The headings are not strictly verbatim to the ground truth (missing hyphens).
- Each listed item is missing the leading hyphen required by the format.
- Gateway changes are not aligned as in the ground truth and lack indentation.

While the content is completely correct, the strict requirement for verbatim formatting causes a significant point reduction.
