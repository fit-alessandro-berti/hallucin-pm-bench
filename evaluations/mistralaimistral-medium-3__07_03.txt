The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: three added tasks, one removed task, and two gateway type changes, matching the ground truth content exactly. However, under utmost strictness, multiple small formatting errors result in a significant deduction: (1) extraneous leading dashes before each heading (not present in ground truth); (2) literal backticks around all task and gateway IDs (not in ground truth; these appear to be misinterpreted from instructional markdown); (3) absence of bullet points ("-") before each list item (ground truth uses them consistently); (4) lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (ground truth includes spaces after the colon for columnar alignment). These accumulate to impair exact fidelity to the expected output structure, though no content inaccuracies or extraneous information are present.
