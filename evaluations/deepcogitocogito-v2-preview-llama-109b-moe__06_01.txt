### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct Identification of Pairs (Positive)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B: (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines) and (Quality_Check, Create_Documentation). This matches the ground truth content exactly (+4.0 points baseline).
- **Alphabetical Order Within Pairs (Major Error)**: The first pair is correctly sorted (Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines). However, the second pair is incorrectly sorted as "Quality_Check — Create_Documentation" (Q before C alphabetically). It should be "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" (-2.0 points).
- **Overall Alphabetical Order of Pairs (Major Error)**: Due to the within-pair sorting error, the list order is wrong: "Procure_Machines" (P) before "Quality_Check" (Q), but with correct within-pair sorting, it should be "Create_Documentation" (C) first, then "Procure_Materials" (P). This violates the "overall list" requirement (-2.0 points).
- **Output Format and Structure (Errors)**: 
  - Includes lengthy reasoning text before the list, violating the "one pair per line" output instruction (implied clean format like ground truth) (-0.5 points).
  - Duplicates the entire list at the end, adding extraneous content (-1.0 point).
  - Minor spacing issues (e.g., single space vs. aligned multiple spaces in ground truth), but not penalized further as secondary.
- **Strictness Applied**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., duplication, extra text) incur significant loss. Total deductions reflect close but flawed matching to ground truth output. No other content errors (e.g., correctly ignores Process A).
