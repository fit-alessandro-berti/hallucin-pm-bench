7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is mostly accurate but deviates in several ways from the ground truth, warranting deductions under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points (partial match, ~7/10)**:
  - Correctly identifies the three core decision points with accurate branching logic.
  - Omits critical contextual placements (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which are essential for a precise summary of the process flow.
  - Introduces minor additions/rephrasings: "risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" (unnecessary detail); "Continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (specific continuation not in ground truth); ">2 points" vs. exact "differ by ≤ 2"; "Proceed to" vs. "send to"; lowercase "approve or reject" vs. capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**"; added explanatory "(for amounts ≥ €15,000)" (extraneous).
  - Formatting differences (e.g., comma in "€15,000" vs. "€15 000") are minor but count as inconsistencies.

- **Required Documents (close but inexact, ~7/10)**:
  - Lists all six documents correctly in order, using exact names.
  - Small but notable errors in descriptions: Adds "old" to Proof of Address; expands "pay-stub/tax slip" to "single pay-stub or tax slip" (introduces "single" and changes "/" to "or"); adds "template" to Community Impact Statement (CIS).
  - Omits the ground truth's explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), which aligns with the prompt's emphasis on avoiding standard terminology and reinforces the non-standard process.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (7/10)**:
  - Uses exact activity names without introducing standard loan terms (good adherence).
  - Unnecessary headers/titles (e.g., "# Acme Bank's Micro-loan Fast-Track Decision Points") add fluff not in ground truth.
  - The answer is comprehensive but not as concise or precise, with cumulative small errors (5+ deviations) justifying a mid-range score rather than higher. No major factual errors, but strictness penalizes inexact phrasing and omissions.
