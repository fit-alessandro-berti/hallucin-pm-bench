The LLM answer has major errors on R2 (incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated; ignores post-Change_Request approval as the "last required approval," with Ship_Goods predating it) and R5 (incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated; overlooks Ship_Goods, Receive_Goods, and Pay_Invoice as "further processing steps" before new Manager_Approval). These are fundamental misinterpretations of rule interactions with the Change_Request, leading to missed violations. R1, R3, R4, and R6 match status and are close in justification; overall result matches. Format adheres well to prompt, but content accuracy is severely compromised (2/6 rules wrong status, wrong justifications for them). Strict deduction for critical compliance errors.
