The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (answering "Yes" as required), provides a valid and minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, and includes a brief, accurate justification focused on the enabling conditions post-T2 (p3=1, p4=0) and the independence of T3 from p3. This directly addresses the prompt without extraneous errors.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for lacking the ground truth's deeper insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 to ever be enabled (due to the inhibitor arc permanently disabling it post-T3), which adds analytical depth but was not strictly required by the prompt's request for a "brief" justification of possibility. No other errors or omissions; the analysis is precise and avoids the ground truth's flaw of including an invalid T4 firing in the sequence (as p3=0 after T5 prevents T4).
