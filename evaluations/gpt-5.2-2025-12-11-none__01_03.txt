### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) Strengths**: Correctly identifies exactly the two decision points. Rules accurately summarized in one sentence each, with precise logic matching the process (Low/Medium + ≤ €250k skip; 2/3 TriVote approvals suffice). Lists all three roles correctly.
- **Part a) Deductions (-0.5 total)**: 
  - Phrasing/structure differences (e.g., "Conditional branch after... (Step 4)" vs. ground truth's "**Risk-based skip after...**"; colon vs. en-dash; "application passes the gate" vs. "loan may advance"; "proceed to Step 5" vs. "proceeds to that review"; adds accurate but unneeded/extra clause "; fewer than two... does not pass").
  - Minor mismatches: "risk rating" (extra word, though implied); "approve" vs. "record “Approve.”"; €250,000 (comma) vs. €250 000 (space).
  - Formatting: Added "(Step X)"; different bolding/italics emphasis.
- **Part b) Strengths**: Exact match on all 9 documents, correct first-appearance order, no hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML).
- **Part b) Deductions (-0.3 total)**: Unnecessary bolding on every item (absent in ground truth); slightly verbose header ("All required documents..." vs. "Required documents...").
- **Overall**: Semantically perfect (no factual errors/omissions), but strict stylistic/phrasing/formatting differences warrant deduction from 10.0. Content fidelity is exceptional.
