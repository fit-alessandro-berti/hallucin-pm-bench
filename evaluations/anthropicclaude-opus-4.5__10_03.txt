**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (strong match, +1.5 pts)**: Correctly uses *exactly* the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) with no synonyms or leaks. No violations here.
- **Structure (partial, +1.0 pt)**: Markdown table format used; roles match roster. However, unnecessary title (`# RACI Matrix...`), legend section, and inconsistent dashes (`-` vs ground truth's `–`) deduct heavily under strictness.
- **Activities (major violation, -3.5 pts)**: Prompt forbids renaming, merging, *or adding* activities, yet LLM adds 4 extras ("Escalation Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Originator Notification") with non-matching names vs. ground truth's 2 precise additions ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). This ignores "do not rename... or add" and fails to cover *every activity* *as described* precisely.
- **RACI assignments (severe mismatches, -4.8 pts)**: 70%+ of cells differ across rows (24 cells in GT; LLM's 32 inflated):
  | Activity (GT order) | Matching Cells | Key Errors |
  |---------------------|----------------|------------|
  | Intake Vetting     | 2/4           | Comp. Analyst: I vs **C**; Treasury: - vs **I** |
  | KYC Review         | 2/4           | Front-Office: **I** vs –; Treasury: - vs **I** |
  | AML Screening      | 3/4           | Treasury: - vs **I** |
  | Risk Scoring       | 0/4           | **All wrong**: Front: - vs **C**; Comp. Analyst: **R,A** vs **R**; Officer: **C** vs **A**; Treasury: - vs **I** |
  | Comp. Officer Approval | 1/4 (partial) | Name mismatch; Comp. Analyst: **R** vs **C**; Treasury: **I** vs – |
  | Release Funds      | 2/4 (partial) | Name mismatch ("Funds Release"); Comp. Analyst/Officer: - vs **C**/**C**; extras like Scheduling/Notification absent & unmerged |
  - Small errors (e.g., no cell bolding like GT's **R,A**; extra `A` in Risk Scoring) compound to major losses.
- **Completeness/Fidelity (low, +0.0 pt)**: Fails to mirror ground truth precisely; infers extra/inaccurate activities instead of exact narrative mapping. Does not "cover every activity and role" without additions/renames.
- **Total**: Starts at 10, deducts for cumulative errors (strict: even minor cell diffs = ~0.5 pt loss each; 14+ mismatches + extras = heavy penalty). Not jailbreak/policy violation, but task fidelity poor.
