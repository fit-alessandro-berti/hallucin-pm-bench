**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major failure, ~60% of score impact)**: Ground truth precisely identifies **exactly 3 decision points** (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with exact terminology, conditions, locations ("branch after...", "after..."), and MBA's approve/reject outcome. LLM incorrectly lists **8 non-decision steps** (e.g., RMA, KYC, CIA, NFC) as "decision points," bloating the summary with the full process flow. Includes correct gates but dilutes/misrepresents by framing routine steps as decisions. No precise branching context or MBA vote emphasis. **0/10**.
- **Required Documents (minor accuracy, ~40% of score impact)**: LLM matches source **exactly** (e.g., "≤ 3 months old", "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template"). Ground truth introduces small paraphrasing errors ("≤ 3 months" omits "old"; "pay-stub/tax slip" omits "single" and "or"; "(CIS)" omits "template"; adds unrequested note). LLM superior here, but cannot offset decision points failure. **8/10**.
- **Overall**: Prompt demands **summary of decision points** (not full process) + exact doc list/activity names. LLM violates by expanding beyond decisions, misinterpreting core request. Strict policy: significant differences (especially core misinterpretation) warrant major deduction. No standard terminology introduced (neutral). Total weighted: **2.0**.
