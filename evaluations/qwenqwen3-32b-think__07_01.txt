### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the prompt's requirements for those categories and avoiding speculation. No extraneous differences are reported, which is appropriate.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Task listings**: The LLM uses only task IDs (e.g., `check_vip`), while the ground truth includes the full element names from the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). This omits key factual details directly readable from the XML's `name` attributes, warranting a significant deduction (~2 points).
- **Gateway description**: Minor wording and detail differences (e.g., LLM lacks "(v1)" and "(v2)" for version specificity), though the core change is stated accurately—small deduction (~0.5 points).
- **Formatting and structure**: Headings use the prompt-specified bullets (•), but the ground truth employs bolding (**), asterisks (*) for sub-items, and backticks only for IDs in parentheses. The LLM's plain backticked IDs and lack of the ground truth's closing note create presentational mismatches—further deduction (~1 point).

Overall, the answer is substantively strong but incomplete in detail and formatting fidelity to the ground truth, resulting in a mid-range score.
