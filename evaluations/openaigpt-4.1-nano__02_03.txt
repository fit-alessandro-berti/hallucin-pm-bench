9.7

- The LLM answer is completely correct in content and presents concise bullet-point answers as required.
- Very minor markdown/formatting difference in enumeration and label/text (no asterisk bullets, no labels like "A1", etc.), but fulfills the prompt accurately.
- Judging with utmost strictness, a small deduction (0.3) for not following the requested double-asterisk emphasis on certain words like in the ground truth answer, though that formatting is soft rather than explicitly required.

Final score: **9.7**
