The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, accuracy, and conciseness across all three questions, with only minor non-substantive differences in formatting (e.g., bullet points vs. labeled items, escaped underscore in ground truth A2, and quotes in LLM Q3) that do not indicate any error or deviation.
