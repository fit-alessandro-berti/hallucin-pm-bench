The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), matching the ground truth content exactly with proper id-name formats and change descriptions. However, it loses 1.0 point for minor formatting discrepancies: absence of bullet points (-) before each item in all sections and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (e.g., extra spaces after the colon in "Gateway_Payment" to match the first line's structure).
