The LLM provided all and only the correct factual differences. However, there are several formatting discrepancies compared to the ground truth:

- The ground truth uses bullet points ("- ") for list items; the LLM omits them.
- For gateways, the ground truth aligns the names with spaces for readability, which the LLM omits.
- For tasks, the LLM omits the "-" at the start of each line.
- In "ADDED TASKS", the wording and order are correct, but the formatting is not strictly verbatim.
- In "REMOVED TASKS", likewise, the expected format is not respected.

Content-wise, the answer is complete, but the failure to follow the required output format exactly—including bullet points and proper spacing—constitutes multiple small errors and justifies a substantial deduction.
