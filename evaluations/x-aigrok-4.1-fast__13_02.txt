**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete:
- Q1: Exact match ("1").
- Q2a/b: Exact matches ("2.08%", "8.33%"), correctly rounded to two decimals.
- Q3: 58 words ≤100; explicitly covers single occurrence, variance/instability (outliers skewing averages, overfitting noise, unreliable forecasts), and over-generalization caution (insufficient support, distorted analyses); process-mining specifics enhance relevance without invention. No errors or deviations from data/ground truth criteria.
