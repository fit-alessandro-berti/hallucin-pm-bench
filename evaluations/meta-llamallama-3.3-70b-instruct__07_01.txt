The LLM answer captures all three changes accurately and matches the ground truth in content, but it has notable deviations in formatting and in the use of element names:

- In the "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" sections, the LLM answer lists only the BPMN element IDs (e.g., "check_vip", "generate_qr", "send_rma_label"), whereas the ground truth includes both the task names and the IDs (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Omitting either piece of information is a significant detail loss.
- The formatting does not follow the exact heading style or bullet/structure of the ground truth answer.
- In "Gateway type changes", the information is accurate but less explicit in wording compared to the ground truth ("gw_valid (exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway)" instead of the more explicit "'gw_valid' changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)").
- It does not indicate "(none)" for any headings, but in this example, this is not required since all categories have changes.

Given the instruction to be "utmost strict" and penalize small errors, these issues result in a notable point loss for lack of completeness, full clarity, and formatting fidelity, even though the essence of the changes is correct.
