8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes (added: three tasks; removed: one task; gateway: exclusive to inclusive) with accurate IDs and names, adhering to the prompt's instruction to ignore cosmetics like renamings (e.g., no mention of "Auto-Approve Loan" or gateway name change). No extraneous changes are added, matching the ground truth's core content.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting differences** (significant deduction: -1.0): LLM uses bullet points (•, -) without numbering or bolding, while ground truth employs numbered lists (*, 1./2./3.) with bolded names. Headings are close but not identical in styling (e.g., no ## or italics for v1/v2).
- **Phrasing in gateway change** (moderate deduction: -0.5): LLM uses XML tags ("exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway"), which is precise but omits the explanatory "(XOR)" and "(OR)" semantics, plus explicit "in v1 to in v2" versioning from ground truth.
- No other errors (e.g., content completeness is perfect; no missing or extra items).

Overall, minor presentation variances prevent a perfect score, but the answer is substantively excellent and directly usable.
