**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks**: Partial (3/3 correct IDs listed, but erroneously includes non-existent "Task_AutoApproveLoan" as added due to name change on existing `Task_ApproveLoan` ID; violates "ignore cosmetic renamings"; format uses IDs only vs. ground truth's name+ID).
- **Removed tasks**: Partial/wrong (correctly lists `Task_RejectLoan`, but erroneously lists `Task_ApproveLoan` as removed; it persists with same ID).
- **Gateway-type changes**: Mostly correct (type change accurate, but omits ID reference and XOR/OR notation from ground truth).
- **Overall**: Major factual errors (misclassifies renamed task as add/remove); deviates from "ALL changes" precision and ground truth content (e.g., no extras, exact items only). Strict penalty for errors: ~80% deviation in task lists → low score. Minor format diffs compound.
