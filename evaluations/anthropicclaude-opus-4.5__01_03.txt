**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (9.5/10)**: Identifies exactly the two decision points with accurate rules in one sentence each. Phrasing is nearly identical to ground truth (e.g., "Low or Medium AND ≤ €250,000" skip; "any two out of three" for TriVote). Minor deductions for slight wordiness ("otherwise, the application must proceed"; "requires input... passes if... does not pass") and explicit step references/naming not in GT, but faithful to process.
- **Part (b) - Documents (4.5/10)**: Major errors. Lists only **8 documents** vs. GT's **9**; **misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" entirely** (explicitly listed in step 8, distinct from unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7). Wrong order: places "ID Matrix Declaration" immediately after "Offer Sheet 77" (as #7), but GT correctly sequences "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (#7) before "ID Matrix Declaration" (#8) per step 8 listing. Includes all others correctly (scorecards, Deck Memo, etc.) in first-appearance order up to that point. Extraneous table format, bolding, and end-summary claiming "**8 distinct documents**" compound inaccuracy.
- **Overall (weighted average, strict penalties for incompleteness/misordering)**: Strong on (a), critically flawed on (b) due to omission of a required document ("list **all**"), factual error in count, and sequencing—each a significant deviation warranting heavy deduction. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML). Extra structure/summary unrequested but not disqualifying.
