5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates a good understanding of the process and consistently uses the mandated terminology: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" with correct spelling/capitalisation, fully complying with the vocabulary policy.

However, there are significant deviations from the ground truth RACI assignment:

- The LLM assigns only R and A per activity, leaving out Consulted (C) and Informed (I) completely, despite their clear presence in the ground truth. This is a major omission: several roles should be marked as C or I for each activity.
- The assignment of A is not accurate in the LLM response. In the ground truth, for example, in "KYC Review," the Account Manager is A, but the LLM gives both R and A to the Compliance Officer.
- Similar misassignments occur in "Payment Clearance" and "Record Update."
- The LLM fails to distinguish between Responsible and Accountable ("R, A" given to the only performing role in each step, regardless of ground truth distinctions).

Positives:
- No forbidden synonyms are used at any point.
- Roles and activities are not altered or expanded beyond those given.
- The structure of the RACI matrix matches expectations in format.

Negatives:
- Consistently omits "Consulted" and "Informed" designations, which is a significant process mapping error.
- Assigns both R and A to one person per step when the ground truth distributes these among multiple roles.
- Fails to reflect the actual collaborative workflow (no C/I handoff or notification implied by the workflow is represented).

Given the strictness required, the omission of C and I throughout, and key A misassignments justify a considerable deduction. However, correct terminology use and generally correct role-process alignment (at a basic level) prevent a failing grade.

Thus, 5.0 reflects a partial but non-trivial fulfillment of requirements, with half the points lost due to substantive RACI misassignments.
