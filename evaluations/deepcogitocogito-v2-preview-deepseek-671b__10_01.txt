3.0

The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" exactly as required, with no forbidden terms appearing. It also maintains the core matrix structure (activities as rows, roles as columns) and correctly identifies the single Responsible (R) role per activity based on the process description, with no unwarranted extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. However, it fails significantly in several areas under strict evaluation:

- **RACI allocations**: The Accountable (A) assignments are incorrect in multiple steps (e.g., assigns A to Compliance Officer for KYC Review and Finance Clerk for Payment Clearance, whereas ground truth assigns A to Account Manager in those cases; no A is assigned for Record Update in ground truth, but LLM incorrectly adds one). All Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments are entirely absent, despite being explicitly present in the ground truth across nearly every activity and roleâ€”this omission makes the matrix incomplete and non-reflective of the inferred narrative interactions (e.g., handoffs implying C and I).
- **Formatting and presentation**: The matrix includes numbering for activities (not in ground truth), uses commas in "R, A" instead of slashes or bolding as in ground truth, adds parentheses to role headers (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), and includes full role names in cells where ground truth uses abbreviated or unadorned formatting with bolding on key cells. These are not minor; they alter the output fidelity.
- **Extra content**: The added note explaining the absence of C/I introduces unnecessary explanation not present in the ground truth, potentially implying self-justification rather than strict adherence to producing only the matrix.
- **Overall fidelity**: With the RACI core (beyond just R) mismatched in 4/6 activities, missing ~80% of ground truth's cell content, and deviations in presentation, the differences are substantial, warranting major point loss despite partial correctness on vocabulary and basic Rs.
