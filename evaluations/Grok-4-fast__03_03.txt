10.0

The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the required BPMN 2.0 model and adheres strictly to the prompt's instructions. It includes all explicitly mentioned flow elements as tasks (e.g., the required "checks warranty eligibility" task omitted in the ground truth), uses the specified gateways (exclusive for completeness and warranty decision; parallel split/join), provides exactly two end events, prefixes all IDs with "wrc_", and matches task names verbatim from the process description (lowercase verbs as in the text, full phrasing without shortening). No elements are invented or omitted. Minor XML variations (e.g., unprefixed namespace, descriptive start event name, unnamed gateways, flow labels) are allowable for equivalence and do not violate BPMN 2.0 validity or prompt semantics. The ground truth, while provided as reference, contains omissions (missing eligibility check task) and non-verbatim names, making the LLM answer superior in completeness and accuracy.
