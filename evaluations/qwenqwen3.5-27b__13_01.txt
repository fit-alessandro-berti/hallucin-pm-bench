10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the system instructions (no inferences beyond the log, all facts derived directly from the 18 lines). 

- Q1: Exact match ("1").
- Q2: Exact match ("5.56%"), correctly rounded.
- Q3: Exact match (sole case "A1002").
- Q4: Provides two valid, clearly stated sampling reasons matching ground truth options ("Small sample size" directly; "Time Span Limitation" = "Temporal bias"), with precise log-derived details (e.g., "18 total events", "single day (2025-05-01)"). No hallucinations or extraneous info.
