### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 by avg waiting time (#1 Request_Documents 36.5/120.0; #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0; #3 Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4) quoted verbatim from table. No other activities/metrics mentioned. (+10/10)
- **Format/Structure**: Close but differences: LLM adds memo headers (To/Subject) and bolding (**), absent in GT; phrasing like "Avg wait **36.5h**; 95p **120h**" vs GT's "avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h" (minor spacing/abbrev/case diffs: "95p" vs "p95", "h" vs " h"). Still crisp memo-style, ≤150 words. (-0.4)
- **Actions**: Logically tied to waiting times, concrete, promise ≥20% cut (LLM explicit targets: <29h/~20%, <9.8h/~20%, <6.2h/~20%; math-accurate). Data-driven via table-derived targets (no invention). Semantic similarity high (#1/#2 near-identical automation/reminders; #3 routing ideas akin), but wording/methods differ (e.g., LLM "skill-based routing + surge" vs GT "rules-engine bypass"; no GT-style "pilot/estimated" claims). (-0.4)

Strict deduction for non-identical phrasing/actions/format despite fulfilling all prompt rules. Very high quality overall.
