3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth)

- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, but Violation in Notes)**: The matrix uses the mandated terms "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" correctly (matching capitalization and exact phrasing), with no forbidden terms appearing in the core matrix. This aligns with the prompt and ground truth. However, the LLM's notes explicitly mention the forbidden legacy terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") in quotes, directly violating the strict policy against mentioning them "even in brackets or quotes." This is a clear, intentional error, warranting a significant deduction despite core compliance. Ground truth notes avoid any such mentions entirely.

- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors â€“ Primary Deviation)**: The assignments do not match the ground truth at all, reflecting a fundamental misinterpretation of the process. Ground truth infers a full RACI spectrum (including C for Consulted and I for Informed across roles per activity), with exactly one Responsible (R) per activity, Accountable (A) placed appropriately (often on AM), and no co-R/A in single cells. The LLM simplifies to only R and A (often combined on one role), omits all C and I entirely, and leaves cells blank instead of specifying them. Specific mismatches include:
  - **Receive Application**: LLM assigns only AM (R/A); ground truth has AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I).
  - **KYC Review**: LLM assigns only CO (R/A); ground truth has CO (R), AM (A), FC (C), IT (I).
  - **Order Vetting**: Matches AM (R/A), but LLM blanks others while ground truth specifies CO (C), FC (I), IT (I).
  - **Payment Clearance**: LLM assigns only FC (R/A); ground truth has FC (R), AM (A), CO (C), IT (I).
  - **Record Update**: LLM assigns only IT (R/A); ground truth has IT (R), AM (C), FC (C), CO (I). Notably, LLM errs by making IT accountable, contradicting ground truth's single A focus elsewhere.
  - **Notify Customer**: Matches AM (R/A), but LLM blanks others while ground truth specifies CO (I), FC (I), IT (I).
  These omissions and assumptions (e.g., LLM's note claiming "no consultations/informed roles required") introduce inaccuracies not present in the process description but explicitly detailed in ground truth. Per rubric, RACI must "reflect the narrative" with exact one R per activity, which LLM partially follows but distorts through missing C/I and improper A placements. This is a severe error, as the matrix is the core output.

- **Format and Structure (Moderate Errors)**: The table structure is similar (activities as rows, roles as columns, correct activity order and naming), earning minor credit. However, ground truth uses a fuller format with all cells populated (e.g., **R / A**, **R**, A, C, I, or implied blanks via dashes but shown), bolding only on R and A. LLM uses **R, A** (comma instead of slash), blanks for non-assignments (vs. ground truth's explicit C/I), and adds unnecessary headers like "*(Adhering strictly to approved terminology)*". The key and extended notes introduce "unwarranted content" (e.g., explaining C/I as "not used," contradicting ground truth; claiming "exactly one A per RACI best practices," which doesn't match ground truth's allocations). Ground truth is concise with no such extras, per rubric's "no extra tasks, roles, or columns."

- **Overall Correctness and Adherence (Low Score Justification)**: While the LLM adheres to the prompt's terminology in the matrix and produces a RACI-like output without introducing new activities/roles, the profound differences in assignments (missing ~70% of ground truth's cell contents), vocabulary violation in notes, and added interpretive content (e.g., notes on replacements and assumptions) make it non-equivalent. Rubric emphasizes "the more differences... the lower the grade," with strictness for small errors; here, core matrix content diverges substantially, and notes violate policy. No "self-awareness" issues apply, but the output fails to "align exactly with process description" as claimed. A score of 3.0 reflects partial credit for terminology and basic structure, but heavy penalties for factual/RACI inaccuracies and policy breaches.
