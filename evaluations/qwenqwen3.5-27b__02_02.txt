The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, structure, and adherence to the prompt instructions:
- Q1/A1: Identical ("3").
- Q2/A2: Identical sequence ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"), ignoring markdown escapes in ground truth.
- Q3/A3: Identical distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock"), listed one per line and alphabetically ordered (A before C). Ground truth formatting ("- " and "<br>") is extraneous to the prompt's "one per line" requirement and does not indicate a discrepancy. No extras, omissions, or hallucinations.
