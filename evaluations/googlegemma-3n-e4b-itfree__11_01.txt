4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (Major Deduction)**: The ranking correctly identifies #1 (Request_Documents) and #2 (Send_Closure_Letter) with verbatim waiting-time figures from the table (avg and 95th percentile). However, #3 is critically wrong—Initial_Screening (2.1h avg) is not the third-worst (Assess_Liability at 7.8h avg is; even Approve_Payment at 3.2h ranks higher than Initial_Screening). This misranks activities strictly by waiting time, violating the core prompt. The ground truth explicitly lists the correct trio, amplifying the discrepancy.
- **No Unwarranted Content (Minor Positive)**: No mention of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities—stays focused on waiting times only.
- **Action Relevance (Partial Credit, but Deduction)**: Recommendations are concrete and tie to waiting times, each claiming ≥20% reduction (e.g., automation for #1 and #2). However, #3's action is irrelevant (targets wrong activity) and lacks the "data-driven" element (no pilots, estimates, or table-supported rationale like ground truth). Actions for #1/#2 are plausible but generic compared to ground truth's specifics (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25% cut").
- **Format and Constraints (Partial Credit)**: Memo format is executive and crisp (~140 words, under 150). Ground truth is more bullet-like/concise, but LLM's structure fits; still, it includes unnecessary headers (TO/FROM/DATE/SUBJECT) not implied in ground truth's minimalist style.
- **Overall Strictness**: This is a high-impact error (wrong activity invalidates one-third of the memo's content), warranting severe deduction despite partial accuracy. Small issues (e.g., less data-driven actions) compound the loss.
