4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~2.0/10)**: The LLM incorrectly identifies and describes the decision points, deviating significantly from the ground truth and prompt's exact terminology/flow. 
  - Includes non-branching steps like **Quick KYC Verification** and **Neighbourhood Feedback Check** as "decision points," which are mandatory verifications/checks without flow-altering branches (not in ground truth).
  - Misnames the key underwriter step as **Dual Underwriter Score-Gate** instead of **Underwriter Alignment Gate** (exact term from prompt/step 5); omits details on escalation to **Harmonisation Committee**.
  - Correctly identifies **Amount Threshold Decision** but misses its precise post-NFC positioning and outcomes (auto-approve vs. proceed to MBA).
  - Completely omits the critical **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a decision point (approve/reject vote), which is explicitly a branching outcome in the process (step 8).
  - Overall: Introduces extraneous/inaccurate points, uses non-exact terms, and fails to capture the exact 3 decision points with their conditional logic/terminology from the ground truth.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors, ~7.0/10)**: The list is nearly complete and uses exact terminology from the prompt, matching the ground truth's core items without introducing standard loan terms. However, small phrasing inconsistencies deduct points under strict criteria:
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's "(≤ 3 months)" (adds "old," though prompt implies recency).
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" matches prompt but ground truth shortens to "(pay-stub/tax slip)," omitting "Latest" and "single."
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes "template" from prompt, but ground truth simplifies to "(CIS)."
  - Omits ground truth's explanatory note on excluded standard documents, which reinforces the non-standard process but isn't strictly required.
  - No additions or omissions of items, so it's faithful but not identical in presentation.

Combined score reflects the prompt's dual focus (decision points weigh heavily due to process specificity), with strict penalties for terminology/flow errors and extraneous content. The LLM's introductory "walk through" narrative also unnecessarily expands beyond a direct summary.
