6.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). Full points here.
- **Part 2**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the small sample size (3 cases, 1 occurrence) and potential for misestimation due to limited data, which aligns partially with the ground truth's emphasis on tiny sample and sampling error. However, it deviates significantly by speculating on process conditions (e.g., "flagged applications," "specific conditions prevalent in the full log")â€”violating the system's "no speculation" rule and differing from the data-strict ground truth. It omits key ground truth elements: precise log stats (14 events, <2 hours, 0% to 7% swing, wide confidence interval), rare event sampling volatility, and the critical issue of near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing matching distortions. The explanation is word-compliant but less analytical and more vague/general, leading to a substantial deduction under strict criteria. Overall, partial alignment but notable gaps and errors warrant a mid-range score.
