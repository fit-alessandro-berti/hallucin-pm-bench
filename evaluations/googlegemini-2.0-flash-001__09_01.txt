The LLM answer correctly identifies that the value cannot be derived and provides a brief, accurate explanation tied to the absence of timestamps, aligning closely with the system prompt's guidance and the ground truth's core reasoning. However, it loses a point for being slightly less comprehensive (e.g., omits explicit mention of durations, ordering, or the risk of fabrication) and for not fully mirroring the ground truth's phrasing or structure, per strict evaluation criteria.
