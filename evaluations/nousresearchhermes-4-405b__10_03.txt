3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks. No disallowed terms appear. However, the additional activities ("Approval" and "Payment Release") deviate slightly from the ground truth phrasing ("Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"), which introduces minor renaming not strictly authorized (+1.0 point).
- **Structure and Coverage (Low Credit)**: The output is a valid Markdown table covering all roles and attempting to include every narrative activity (four mandated + two implied: approval and release). No merging or extraneous additions. However, empty cells are used instead of dashes (–) for no involvement, which mismatches the ground truth format (-1.0 point). It covers "every activity," but the prompt emphasizes "do not rename," and the extras are not precisely aligned.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deductions)**: This is the core failure, warranting severe penalties under strictness rules. The LLM's assignments are simplistic, incomplete, and inaccurate across nearly all cells:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Only "Responsible" for Front-Office Analyst; misses R,A combo, Consulted (Compliance Analyst), Informed (Treasury Ops), and – for Officer (-1.5 points).
  - **KYC Review**: Only "Responsible" for Compliance Analyst; misses R,A, Consulted (Officer), Informed (Treasury), and – for Front (-1.5 points).
  - **AML Screening**: Same as KYC Review; identical misses (-1.5 points).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Only "Responsible" for Compliance Analyst; misses Responsible (Compliance), Accountable (Officer), Consulted (Front-Office), Informed (Treasury) (-1.5 points).
  - **Approval**: Only "Accountable" for Officer; misses R,A (Officer), Informed (Front), Consulted (Compliance), and – for Treasury. Also, renamed from ground truth (-1.5 points).
  - **Payment Release**: Only "Responsible" for Treasury Ops; misses R,A (Treasury), Informed (Front), Consulted (Compliance and Officer) (-1.5 points).
  - No use of combined notations like "R, A" or any Consulted/Informed roles at all, ignoring the narrative's implied consultations/escalations/notifications. This represents ~80% mismatch in content, with small errors (e.g., missing I/C) compounded into total inaccuracy (-6.0 points overall for RACI).
- **Overall Strictness**: Starting from 10.0, deductions total -7.0 for RACI failures (small per-cell errors amplified), -1.0 for format inconsistencies, -0.5 for minor renaming, offset by +1.5 for vocab adherence and basic structure. The response attempts the task but fundamentally misinterprets RACI depth from the narrative, leading to a low score.
