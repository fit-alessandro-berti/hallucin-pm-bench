3.5

The LLM’s answer has several severe issues compared to the ground truth and the instructions:

**Vocabulary policy compliance:**  
- It fully respects the term requirements—only “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, and “Risk Scoring” are used. No disallowed synonyms leak in.

**Structural/Process mapping issues:**  
- **Activities are renamed, merged, or omitted:**  
    - "Compliance Officer Approval" is rendered as just “Approval,” losing the specificity and violating the instruction not to rename activities.
    - "Release Funds" is replaced with “Payment Release.”
- The matrix omits or merges activities: there is no “Compliance Officer Approval” or “Release Funds” activity named as such.
- The “Risk Scoring” activity does not reflect the correct assignment (should be A = Compliance Officer).

**RACI assignments:**  
- The LLM answer only uses single responsibility per activity (“Responsible” or “Accountable”)—it almost never assigns both R and A to any role for an activity, whereas the ground truth sometimes has both.
- Missing C (Consulted) and I (Informed) assignments for nearly all activities, which the ground truth includes for nearly every role and activity.
- Uses only "Responsible" and "Accountable"—no “Consulted” or “Informed” anywhere, which is a substantial completeness and accuracy failure.
- Treasury Ops is only “Responsible” for “Payment Release”; in the ground truth, it is “R, A” for “Release Funds” and “I”/“C” for previous activities.

**Other issues:**  
- The LLM omits dashes (–) for uninvolved roles.
- The "Key" (R, A, –, etc.) is not explained.
- The ordering/expansion of activities does not match the process breakdown required.

**Summary:**  
While the vocabulary is strictly followed (and thus this is not a total failure), the mapping of process and assignment of RACI responsibilities is severely deficient. There are missing activities, merged activities, and almost no correct assignment of Consulted/Informed roles. Because these are major process-governance failings, a strict grading merits a *low* score, even though there is some redeeming vocabulary compliance and partial activity listing.

**Score rationale:**  
- The answer is not completely wrong—vocabulary is strictly correct.
- Most RACI assignments and activity mapping are incorrect or incomplete.

**Therefore: 3.5** (Severe faults, though not a zero because of vocabulary adherence).
