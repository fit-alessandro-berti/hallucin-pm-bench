**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete:

- Q1: Exact match (1 occurrence, correctly identifies sole instance in C05).
- Q2a/b: Exact calculations (2.08%, 8.33%), with correct totals (48 events, 12 cases) and rounding.
- Q3: 72 words (under limit). Covers required elements strictly: (i) single occurrence (explicitly states "1 out of 12 cases... 1 out of 48 events"), (ii) variance/instability (overfitting, skew metrics/models, rare exceptions vs. norms), (iii) caution against over-generalisation (risks from small/non-representative slice, misallocation/inaccurate forecasts). Directly addresses "performance or predictive analyses." No inventions; format clear and data-only. No errors or deviations.
