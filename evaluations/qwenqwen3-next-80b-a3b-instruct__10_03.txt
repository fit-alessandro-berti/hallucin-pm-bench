3.0

The LLM answer demonstrates some adherence to the vocabulary policy (it only uses the four authorized activity names) and supplies a Markdown table as requested. However, it suffers from major deviations from the ground truth:

- It omits two required activities: **Compliance Officer Approval** and **Release Funds**. Only four activities are included, instead of the expected six.
- The assigned RACI codes for each activity do not match the ground truth. For example:
    - **Intake Vetting** should assign both R and A to the Front-Office Analyst (“R, A”), not just Responsible; other roles' involvement is also misassigned.
    - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening** should have “R, A” for the Compliance Analyst.
    - **Risk Scoring** is misassigned: the Compliance Analyst should be R, Compliance Officer A, Front-Office Analyst C, and Treasury Ops I.
    - The matrix uses “Consulted” and “Informed” designations where the ground truth expects dashes (–) or “C” and “I”.
- The table structure/formatting does not bold activity names as in the ground truth (minor issue but reflects precision).
- There is no dash used to mark roles with no involvement (–); instead, the roles are always marked as at least Informed.
- It does not combine R and A where both apply (always lists one), against the standard shown in the ground truth.
- The omission of activities and the failure to assign roles precisely (especially Accountable designation missing in several cases) are significant, as the prompt stressed utmost strictness for even small errors.

Therefore, due to missing activities, role assignment errors, and imprecise representation of the RACI markings, the answer merits a low but nonzero score: **3.0**.
