4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +2.0):** The LLM answer correctly uses only the four authorized terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). This aligns with the strict policy and key points for the judge.
- **Completeness of Activities (Major Deduction, -4.0):** The prompt requires covering "**every activity** described" in the narrative without adding, merging, or renaming. The narrative includes additional activities beyond the four mandated terms: escalation/approval by the Compliance Officer (if risk >70) and fund release/scheduling/notification by Treasury Ops. The ground truth explicitly adds "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" to fully cover these. The LLM omits them entirely, resulting in an incomplete matrix (only 4 rows vs. ground truth's 6). This is a critical failure under "utmost strictness," as it ignores process steps like approval and execution.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction, -3.0):** Assignments differ substantially from the ground truth across all activities, even for the shared four:
  - **Intake Vetting:** LLM assigns Front-Office as Responsible only (others Informed); ground truth has Front-Office as R,A; Compliance Analyst as C; Compliance Officer as –; Treasury as I. LLM incorrectly informs Officer/Analyst and misses C/– distinctions.
  - **KYC Review:** LLM has Compliance Analyst Responsible, Officer Consulted (others Informed); ground truth has Analyst R,A; Officer C; Front-Office/Treasury as –/I. Misses R,A combo and – for Front-Office.
  - **AML Screening:** Similar mismatch—LLM lacks R,A for Analyst and – for Front-Office; ground truth treats it separately but consistently with KYC.
  - **Risk Scoring:** LLM has Analyst Responsible, Officer Accountable (others Informed); ground truth has Analyst R, Front-Office C, Officer A, Treasury I (no –). Misses Consulted for Front-Office.
  These are not minor; even small role shifts (e.g., Informed vs. Consulted/–) warrant significant loss per instructions.
- **Format and Structure (Minor Deduction, -1.0):** Markdown table is used correctly with all roles as columns. However, LLM uses verbose full terms (e.g., "Responsible") in single cells, lacking abbreviations (R/A/C/I), combinations (e.g., "R, A"), bolding for activities/R,A, and dashes (–) for no involvement—directly contrasting the ground truth's concise, standardized style. While the prompt doesn't explicitly mandate abbreviations/bolding, the differences from ground truth (e.g., no handling of combined R,A or –) reduce fidelity.
- **Overall Strictness:** Total differences are extensive (incompleteness + mismatched assignments), justifying a low score. The LLM captures the core vocabulary and basic RACI intent but fails to fully represent the process, leading to ~60% misalignment with ground truth. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply.
