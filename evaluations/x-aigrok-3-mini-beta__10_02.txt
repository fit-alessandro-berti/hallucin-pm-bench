**Justification:**

- The LLM answer uses the enforced vocabulary correctly for Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and KYC Review. However, it *omits the role Operations Manager* which appears in the ground truth, and assigns Accountable roles differently.
- RACI assignments are *frequently incorrect or oversimplified*. For example, the LLM answer assigns most Accountable roles to the same as the Responsible; in the ground truth, Accountable is handled distinctively and often given to the Operations Manager (who is missing from the LLM’s table).
- Consulted and Informed columns are underpopulated compared to the ground truth and sometimes missing where the ground truth has explicit values (for instance, Regulatory Liaison as Consulted or Informed in key steps).
- The task names often directly copy the original informal text rather than consistently applying mandated phrasing (e.g., “Perform KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary” instead of simply "KYC Review").
- The LLM added some detail (e.g., “IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent”) not present in the official RACI mapping, and its order/organization of activities is less clear than the ground truth.
- The legend is missing, though this is a minor documentation lapse.

**Major Deductions:**
- Critical error: Missing a mandated role (Operations Manager) for Accountable.
- Significant misassignment: A lot of Accountable mapped incorrectly.
- Some columns left blank/incomplete.
- Tasks not fully harmonized with mandated vocabulary in column labels.

**Minor Deductions:**
- Task wording style could be more consistent.
- Legend missing.

**Summary:** While the answer largely applies the vocabulary requirement, the *organizational structure and RACI allocations are substantially divergent from the ground truth*. The missing Operations Manager as Accountable is a severe fault given the prompt’s emphasis on strictness. The incompleteness and numerous mapping errors bring this answer well below passing.
