1.5

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Table format and structure**: The LLM uses a non-standard RACI layout with R/A/C/I as columns and roles filled into cells, rather than the standard matrix format with roles (e.g., Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, etc.) as columns and tasks as rows with R/A/C/I letters in intersections. This fundamentally misrepresents a RACI table, as seen in the ground truth.

- **Tasks/rows**: The LLM includes 7 tasks, adding an explicit row for "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" (from the source step 5) and separating archiving from notification, while shortening/rephrasing descriptions inconsistently (e.g., "Receive and log customer’s transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"). The ground truth has exactly 6 tasks, omits SWIFT sending, uses mandated wording like "**KYC Review**" as a bolded row header, and merges elements (e.g., release without SWIFT). No bolding or exact phrasing matches.

- **Roles**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely (present in all ground truth rows as Accountable for most tasks), limiting itself to Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support. This creates incomplete coverage compared to the ground truth.

- **RACI assignments**: Nearly every cell differs. For example:
  - Receive: LLM has R/A for Transaction Analyst only; ground truth has R (Analyst), I (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), C (IT Support).
  - Screen: LLM has R (Analyst), A (Liaison); ground truth has R (Analyst), A (Liaison), I (Operations Manager), C (IT Support).
  - KYC Review: LLM has R/A (Liaison); ground truth has C (Analyst), R (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), I (IT Support).
  - All other rows show mismatches in letters and roles, including the LLM's extra rows with no ground truth equivalents.
  No legend matches the ground truth's placement or wording.

- **Additional issues**: The LLM includes extraneous introductory text (rephrasing tasks, explaining vocabulary, defining RACI), which the ground truth avoids for directness. While the LLM correctly mandates vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"), it fails to align overall with the ground truth's organization and completeness.

These errors—structural, content, and interpretive—result in substantial divergence, with even minor phrasing inconsistencies (e.g., task names) compounding the loss. A perfect match would require identical format, tasks, roles, and assignments.
