The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No"), provides a precise justification citing the relevant counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with accurate activity sequences, and notes the direct succession in the remaining cases (C001 and C003) to fully contextualize the universal claim's falsity. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core content and logic. Minor deductions for not using a structured table format (as in ground truth) and slightly less exhaustive case-by-case detailing, though the response fully meets the task's requirements without errors.
