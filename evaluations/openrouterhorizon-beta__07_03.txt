The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact content matching the ground truth: added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), removed task (Task_ManualReview), and gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment, both exclusive â†’ parallel). No extras, omissions, or commentary are present, adhering to the prompt's restrictions. However, strict evaluation penalizes formatting differences: headings include extraneous leading dashes ("- ADDED TASKS" vs. plain "ADDED TASKS"), list items lack bullets (plain lines vs. "- " prefixed), and the second gateway entry omits alignment spaces. These small presentational inconsistencies result in a minor deduction despite perfect substantive accuracy.
