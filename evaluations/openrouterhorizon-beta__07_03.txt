The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes, but loses significant points for the following issues:

- **Headings Format**: The answer prepends a hyphen ("- ") before each heading. The ground truth omits this, making the LLM answer's sections not *verbatim* to the requested format. This is considered a notable error per strict evaluation.
- **Bullet Formatting**: The LLM answer lists tasks/gateways as "Task_XYZ (Name)" or "Gateway_Name: ...", without bullets. The ground truth uses proper hyphen bullets at the start of each item. This mismatch in list formatting is a significant difference.
- **Whitespace/Alignment**: In the "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" section, the ground truth aligns identifiers for clarity, e.g., "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel". The LLM answer omits this spacing, resulting in a less precise match.
- **Accuracy**: The actual content (IDs/names/changes) is correct, so no points are lost for information accuracy.

Due to the strictness required about exact output structure and formatting, these deviations justify a substantial deduction even though all real differences are identified.
