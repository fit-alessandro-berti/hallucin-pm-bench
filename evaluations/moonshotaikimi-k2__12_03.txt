9.0

The LLM answer is clear, identifies all relevant evidence, and justifies the “No” by citing both Case02 and Case04 (corresponding to C002 and C004) as violating examples, with accurate activity sequences and correct focus on the activities intervening between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*. However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer is a little less systematic: it does not explicitly address all four cases—in particular, it does not mention the cases (C001, C003) where “Validate_Payment” does immediately follow “Receive_Order.” This omission would be important in strict analysis because full coverage for completeness is best. Thus, a 1-point deduction is warranted for this lack of completeness, resulting in a 9.0 score.
