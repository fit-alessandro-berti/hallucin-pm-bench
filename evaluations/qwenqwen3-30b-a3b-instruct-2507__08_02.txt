The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on both questions. It wrongly asserts "No" for Q1, ignoring the parallel path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) that enables T5 by placing a token in P5 while leaving P2 marked for T5's consumption—before T3 fires. The provided explanation misstates dependencies (e.g., falsely claiming T3 must precede for P2 to be available, when the sequence preserves P2). No valid sequence is given, contrary to the ground truth's clear "Yes" and minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5). This inversion of the net's behavior warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation.
