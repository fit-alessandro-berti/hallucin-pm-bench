7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Structure and Format (High Fidelity, +2.5 points)**: The LLM answer adheres closely to the memo format with To/From/Subject, uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations, and returns only the memo text. Minor deductions for lacking a recommendations header (present in ground truth) and slightly different phrasing in bold/italics usage.
- **Identification of Activities (Perfect Match, +2.5 points)**: Correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, with no inventions.
- **Quantification of SLA Breaches (Perfect Match, +2.0 points)**: Exact matches for excesses (+300s for Legal and Risk; +60s for Credit), throughput times, and waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Ground truth uses "+" notation; LLM uses "breaches by" or "exceeds by"—negligible difference.
- **Introduction/Analysis (Moderate Match, +1.0 point)**: Both highlight the issues similarly, but LLM's phrasing ("based on SLA breaches and excessive waiting times") is concise and data-grounded, while ground truth adds invented details (e.g., "4,805 completed cases," "largest queues," "April 2025 sample"). LLM avoids inventions, but wording differs significantly, warranting deduction for not mirroring ground truth's tone.
- **Recommendations (Partial Match, +1.0 point)**: Bullets are used correctly and are data-driven (referencing specific time reductions tied to metrics), but the actions differ entirely: LLM's are generic resource/process optimizations (e.g., "reallocate resources," "implement parallel processing"), while ground truth's are highly specific and inventive (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"). This is a major deviation in concreteness and content, per strict criteria.
- **Closing/Overall Length (Moderate Match, +0.5 point)**: Both ≈150 words and end with forward-looking statements, but ground truth projects ungrounded metrics (35% reduction, end-to-end cycle time), while LLM stays data-tied ("prioritize waiting time reduction"). Deduction for differing phrasing and lack of ground truth's projection specificity.
- **Strictness Adjustments (-2.0 points total)**: Small errors like mismatched From line ("Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office"), Subject mismatch, and integrated vs. headed recommendations reflect in point loss. No major inventions in LLM (unlike ground truth's additions), but strict comparison to ground truth penalizes non-identical content heavily, especially in recommendations.

Total reflects strong factual alignment but significant creative/content divergence from ground truth.
