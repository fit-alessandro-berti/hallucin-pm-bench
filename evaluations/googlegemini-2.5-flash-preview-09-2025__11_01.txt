8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (activities, rankings, and metrics)**: Perfect match. The three worst activities by average waiting time are accurately identified (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120.0h; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4h). All figures quoted verbatim from the table, with no extraneous metrics (e.g., no service times or throughput discussed). (+10/10)
- **Format and Structure**: Strong executive memo style with clear ranking, but deviates from ground truth's ultra-concise plain-text list by using a table, headers (TO/FROM/DATE/SUBJECT), and a closing sentence. Word count is ~120 (under 150), but added elements like date and "customer satisfaction" introduce minor fluff not in ground truth, slightly bloating crispness. (-1.0)
- **Actions**: Each is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues, and specifies ≥20% reduction (e.g., 20%, 25%, 20%). Data-driven via implied targets, without unsupported inventions. However, actions differ significantly from ground truth (e.g., LLM suggests automation/escalation/staff dedication vs. ground truth's reminders/e-signatures/rules-engine), reducing alignment. All promise ≥20% without fabrication, but lack ground truth's pseudo-evidence (e.g., "pilot tests show"). (-0.5)
- **No Unwarranted Content**: Mostly clean—no other activities or forbidden topics. Minor ding for "improve cycle time," which borders on discussing throughput (prompt explicitly bans it), even if tangential. Closing on "customer satisfaction" is extraneous. (-0.5 total for strictness on small extras)

Overall, highly compliant with prompt but penalized for stylistic/presentation differences and action variances from ground truth, per strict criteria.
