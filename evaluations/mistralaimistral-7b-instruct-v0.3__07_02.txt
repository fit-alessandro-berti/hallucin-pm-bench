**4.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks (8/10)**: Correctly identifies all 3 added tasks by ID (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject). Minor deduction for lacking names (e.g., "Verify Identity") and exact formatting (bold names + ID in parens) as in ground truth.
- **Removed tasks (0/10)**: **Critical error** – explicitly claims "None", but ground truth correctly identifies **Reject Loan (Task_RejectLoan)** as removed (present in v1 Flow_4, absent in v2). This misses a core change, violating "summarise *all* changes".
- **Gateway-type changes (5/10)**: Correctly notes type change (exclusive → inclusive for Gateway_Decision), matching ground truth. Significant deductions for including irrelevant cosmetic changes (gateway name "Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check"; flow names "yes" → "eligible" etc.), explicitly ignored by instructions, and extra points bloating the section beyond ground truth's concise single item.
- **Overall**: Fails to capture *all* changes (missed removal), adds forbidden details, minor format mismatches. Strict policy demands heavy penalty for these errors (one major omission = ~half credit lost; extras/pollution further reduce). No other unlisted changes, but completeness flawed.
