The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately flags the Rule 3 violation as the key issue (NA before RA). However, it contains significant errors in the justification: (1) Rule 1 is incorrectly deemed violated due to a misinterpretation requiring no interruptions, when the rule only mandates order and uniqueness (satisfied in ground truth); deduct 3 points. (2) Rule 2 is wrongly labeled "not applicable" despite VP occurring after both QE and RA (satisfied); deduct 3 points. (3) Rule 4 is dismissed as "not applicable" instead of satisfied; deduct 2 points. The format deviates from the ground truth's tabular structure, and the response overstates violations, leading to a strict score reflecting multiple factual inaccuracies.
