**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added: check_vip, generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway: gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway) using exact XML ids under the precise headings, with no extras or speculation. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Significant deductions** for not matching ground truth format/content:
  - Tasks list only ids (e.g., "check_vip") instead of names + ids (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`*)"), omitting XML names and using wrong bullet ("- " vs "* ").
  - No blank lines after headings.
  - Gateway phrasing ("gw_valid (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway)") differs from verbose "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)", lacking "changed from/to", v1/v2 labels, backticks, and bolds.
  - Missing final note "*(No other differences should be reported.)*".

Core facts perfect (no invention/errors), but multiple small-medium presentation mismatches cause ~30% loss vs. exact ground truth match.
