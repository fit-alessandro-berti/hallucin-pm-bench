The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides accurate counterexamples from C002 and C004 with precise activity sequences, directly addressing the task's requirements for justification via relevant CaseIDs. It also implicitly acknowledges the "always" claim by noting the sequence occurs in some (but not all) cases, which aligns with the ground truth's conclusion. However, under strict evaluation, it loses a full point for not exhaustively covering all cases (e.g., omitting explicit confirmation of C001 and C003 compliance, as in the ground truth's table), reducing comprehensiveness despite the core logic being sound and sufficient for disproof.
