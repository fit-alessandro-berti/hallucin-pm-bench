The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, earning full credit there. For Q5, it correctly identifies two activities ("Validate_Order" and "Pack_Items") but incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which does appear as the first event in case C-77) while omitting "Ship_Order". This is a significant factual error in the list, as it misrepresents the activities that never start a case, warranting a deduction of 20% overall under strict evaluation criteria for partial correctness in a multi-item response.
