7.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth on Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. The only error is in Q5, where "Quality_Check" is incorrectly listed (it does appear as the first event for case C-77) and "Ship_Order" is omitted (it never appears as a first event). This is a significant factual mistake, though the remaining structure and answers are otherwise correct.

Strict evaluation: One major factual error out of five questions should reduce the score substantially. A score of 7.0 reflects very good, but not excellent, accuracy.
