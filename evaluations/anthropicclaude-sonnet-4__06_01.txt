The LLM answer gets the content correct, listing exactly both valid pairs of tasks in Process B that can occur in parallel. The output uses correct task names, and the logic is sound.

However, for **maximum strictness**, there are two formatting errors compared to the ground truth:

1. **Formatting of spacing:**  
   - The LLM answer has only a single space before and after the em dash (`—`), e.g.  
     `Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check`  
     The ground truth uses five spaces between task names and the em dash as well as after the em dash, e.g.:  
     `Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines`
   - The LLM answer’s spacing/alignment does not match the ground-truth’s (which clearly lines up em dashes and task names).
2. **Omitted code block:**  
   - The ground truth wraps the answer in triple backticks (\`\`\`), clearly marking it as a code block. The LLM answer does not.

Because these are "small errors" but the evaluation is to be "utmost strictness", even these minor variations (especially the explicit format requested) must deduct a full point. No content errors; all parallel pairs are correct; but formatting is not fully adhered to.

**Final score:**  
**9.0**
