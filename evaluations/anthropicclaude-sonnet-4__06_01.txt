The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B without additions or omissions, orders them alphabetically both within pairs and overall, and uses the specified format nearly identically (minor potential spacing variance in the second pair's rendering does not alter meaning). However, the inclusion of unrequested introductory reasoning text deviates from the prompt's strict output instructions to "return the pairs" and "output one pair per line," warranting a deduction despite the core content matching the ground truth.
