The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth and correctly analyzes every rule. It accurately identifies the violation (Rule 3: NA occurs before RA), concludes "No" for compliance, and gives concise justifications referencing all rules. However, there is a slight loss of points for not clearly matching the tabulated/structured format of the gold standard answer, and very minor difference in wording (e.g., "step 7" vs. tabular reasoning). No factual errors are present, but utmost strictness requires penalizing deviations in format and completeness.
