The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise justification by citing the two relevant counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with their exact violating activity sequences, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core conclusion and evidence. Minor deduction for not exhaustively analyzing all cases (e.g., omitting the compliant C001 and C003 as in the ground truth table), which reduces comprehensiveness but does not introduce errors or fail the task requirements.
