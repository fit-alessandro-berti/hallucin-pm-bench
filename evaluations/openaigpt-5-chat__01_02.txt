7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core elements of the prompt but incurs deductions for key deviations from the ground truth under strict criteria:

- **Decision Points (Major Partial Match, -2.0 points)**: 
  - Correctly identifies and describes the first two decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with near-identical logic, terminology, and flow, adhering to the prompt's exact activity names.
  - However, it omits the third decision point explicitly listed in the ground truth: **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a standalone point where the board votes "Approve" or "Reject." Instead, the LLM folds this outcome into the second point's description ("where the Board votes *approve* or *reject*"), which alters the structure and completeness. This is a significant structural error, as the ground truth treats MBA as a distinct decision, reflecting the process's binary outcome.

- **Required Documents (Strong Match, -0.5 points)**: 
  - Lists all six required documents accurately, matching the ground truth in content, order, and exact terminology from the prompt (e.g., "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)," "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet").
  - Minor phrasing variances (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay‑stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; including "(CIS) template" which aligns with the prompt but ground truth omits "template") are small but deduct slightly per strictness rules. The ground truth's extra note ("No credit bureau report...") is absent but not required by the prompt, so no further penalty.

- **Overall Adherence and Extras (-0.0 additional points)**: 
  - Sticks to prompt terminology without introducing standard loan terms, as required.
  - Formatting (bold headings, bullets) is clear but introduces unnecessary emphasis not in ground truth.
  - Unsolicited offer ("If you like, I can also create a flow diagram...") adds irrelevant content, slightly diluting focus but not a major violation.

This results in a high but imperfect score: comprehensive on documents and most decisions, but the omission of a full decision point prevents a top rating. Total differences reflect ~25% incompleteness in decision points.
