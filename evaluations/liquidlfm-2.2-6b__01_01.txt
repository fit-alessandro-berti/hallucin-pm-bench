### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, ~50% of Score Weight)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points with branching logic/outcomes (eligibility check, amount threshold, final payment approval). The LLM answer only covers two (triage eligibility and finance pre-approval), omitting the amount threshold (> €1,000 branch) as a distinct decision point after pre-approval and the final approval/rejection at pre-approval/auditor review. It mentions the high-value branch in a note but does not summarize it as a decision with outcomes, violating the "summarise every decision point" requirement. Branching logic (e.g., eligible/not eligible → continue/reject; approved/rejected → payment/end) is implied but not explicitly stated for any point, leading to incomplete and inaccurate summarization. Small omissions like this warrant significant deduction per instructions.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Match, ~40% of Score Weight)**: The list is complete and accurate, matching all seven documents from the ground truth, including the conditional *AuditTrail*. No introductions of undefined artefacts. Minor phrasing (e.g., explanatory notes on usage) is present but does not add new documents.

- **Overall Adherence to Prompt (Minor Issues, ~10% of Score Weight)**: Structure is clear but less tabular/organized than ground truth. Introduces minor undefined details (e.g., "departure cancellation status," "severe weather justification") as examples, which are not in the process description—small error but strict deduction applied. Correctly avoids legacy activities. Response is concise but misses full coverage, resulting in a mid-low score for incompleteness.
