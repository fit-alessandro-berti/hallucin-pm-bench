**9.2**

- Q1 matches ground truth closely (exact count and cases listed; minor phrasing/formatting variance).
- Q2 fully correct (identifies "Pack_Items"); extras (timestamps, explanation) add unrequested detail but do not contradict—minor deduction for lack of maximal conciseness.
- Q3 fully correct (identifies "Cancel_Order"); extra clarification is accurate but exceeds ground truth brevity—minor deduction. Overall, content-perfect with only stylistic extras vs. ground truth.
