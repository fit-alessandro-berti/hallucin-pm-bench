6.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision Points:**  
The LLM answer correctly captures the two decision points, accurately identifying the conditions and summarizing each in a concise, single sentence. No notable errors or omissions here.

**b) Documents List:**  
The LLM’s listing stops at “Deck Memo” (from step 5), omitting all subsequent required documents:  
- Offer Sheet 77 (step 7)  
- Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8)  
- ID Matrix Declaration (step 8)  
- Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9)  

This is a significant omission since the ground truth lists 9 documents and the LLM only includes 5. This is a substantial factual gap and constitutes a severe loss of points—even though the order and content of the first five documents are correct, failing to mention nearly half of the required documents is a major error.

**Other evaluation notes:**  
- The LLM correctly avoids hallucinated documents such as KYC/AML files.  
- Step and process logic in part (a) is sound.

**Conclusion:**  
Full credit for (a), but approximately half the required response is missing in (b). Thus, 6.0 reflects “substantially correct for decision points, but major incompleteness for the document list.”
