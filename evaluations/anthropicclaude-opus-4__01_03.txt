4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 8.5/10):** The LLM correctly identifies the two key decision points and summarizes their rules in one sentence each, aligning closely with the ground truth. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., not explicitly stating "otherwise it proceeds to that review" in the first point, and omitting the detail that all three officers participate/review while two approvals suffice in the second). These are small but warrant a strict penalty per instructions.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 1.0/10):** Severely incomplete and inaccurate. The LLM lists only the first five documents (Form 14B and the three scorecards, plus Deck Memo), omitting the remaining four (Offer Sheet 77, Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, and Loan Dossier 2025) that first appear in Steps 7â€“9. This is a major error, as the task requires *all* documents in first-appearance order, and the ground truth explicitly includes them. No hallucinations (e.g., no invalid KYC/AML mentions), but the incompleteness alone justifies a near-minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.

- **Overall Score Calculation:** Weighted average of parts (assuming equal importance), with strict penalties for omissions: (8.5 + 1.0) / 2 = 4.75, rounded down to 4.5 for the significant flaws in completeness and adherence to the full process description.
