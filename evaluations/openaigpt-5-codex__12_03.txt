The LLM answer correctly determines the fact is inaccurate ("No"), identifies the precise counterexamples (C002 and C004) with accurate sequence descriptions, and thereby justifies the decision per the task requirements. It matches the ground truth in conclusion, key evidence, and reasoning logic, with no factual errors or omissions that misrepresent the logâ€”thoroughness beyond counterexamples is not mandated by the prompt.
