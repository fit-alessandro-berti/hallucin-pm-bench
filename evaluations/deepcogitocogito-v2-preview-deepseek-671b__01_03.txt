8.0

**Justification:**

The LLM answer shows close but not perfect alignment with the ground truth.

**a) Decision points**  
- The LLM accurately identifies and describes both required decision points (risk/amount branch, TriVote gate).
- The answers for both are clear and essentially correct, but the LLM adds some paraphrasing and slight wordiness ("Proceeds only if..." and "Loan advances only if...") and some unnecessary explanation rather than exactly restating the process rule in a single, precise sentence.  
- Minor loss of precision: The LLM’s summary of the conditional in step 4 is almost perfect, but the phrase "proceeds only if ..." is a slight paraphrase rather than a direct, static restatement of the rule as in the ground truth ("the process bypasses..." / "otherwise proceeds ...").  
- For TriVote, it writes "only if at least two of the three officers ... approve" which is a minor stylistic difference from the ground truth ("when at least two of the three approvers record 'Approve.'")—this is acceptable, but a bit less crisp.  
- The explanation text interleaved with (a) is unnecessary and makes it less succinct—results should be stated in direct answer format rather than shown as the result of a thinking process.  
- Overall: Slight decrease due to format/conciseness/precision.

**b) Document list**  
- Lists all required documents in precisely the order they first appear.  
- Recognizes conditionality of Deck Memo but still includes it, as the ground truth requires.  
- Handles "Signed Offer Sheet 77" correctly (does not treat as a duplicate of the unsigned version).  
- There is some minor ambiguity in the explanation regarding the distinction between the document being generated vs required, but the final list is accurate and in order.
- The explanation for including Scorecards as documents is slightly verbose but ultimately correct.

**Other observations:**  
- No hallucination of additional documents or KYC/AML files.
- Uses primarily internal process names; no genericizations.
- Slight loss of clarity in the final answer format and wording—question asks for a summary "in one sentence each," and the presented text almost but not quite fulfills that with maximum succinctness.

**Overall:**  
- No major factual or logical errors; minimal issues are related to crispness, conciseness, and some mild over-explaining and paraphrasing.
- Given the scoring rubric that even small errors are to be penalized significantly, a 2.0-point deduction is warranted for these weaknesses.

**Final: 8.0/10.0**
