**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically and structurally identical to the ground truth. It correctly enumerates the three parallel blocks from Process B only (P1, P2, P3), with exact task names, order, and comma separation as required by the prompt. Minor whitespace differences after commas (present in ground truth, absent in LLM) do not constitute errors, as the prompt specifies only "separated by commas" without mandating spaces, and such formatting variations are insignificant under standard evaluation criteria despite strictness instructions. No extraneous content, sequential tasks, or references to other processes.
