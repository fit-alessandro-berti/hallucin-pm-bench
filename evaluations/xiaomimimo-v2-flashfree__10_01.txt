**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Perfect adherence to vocabulary policy—all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") used exactly; no forbidden terms. Activities match exactly. Exactly one Responsible (R) per row, aligned with narrative performers. Some cell matches (e.g., KYC Review: AM=A, CO=R; Record Update: AM=C, IT=R; Payment Clearance: FC=R).
- **Major differences/deductions (significant point loss per strictness rule)**:
  - **Incomplete matrix**: Blanks in ~70% of cells (16/24); ground truth fills *all* cells with R/A, A, R, C, or I. Blanks do not match C or I—big error in standard RACI format.
  - **Missing/incorrect allocations**: No "I" (Informed) anywhere (ubiquitous in ground truth, e.g., IT=I in 5/6 rows). No dual "**R / A**" (used 4x in ground truth for AM). Wrong/missing A (e.g., Payment Clearance AM blank vs. A; Receive Application AM R vs. **R / A**).
  - **Format mismatches**: No bolding (** on key activities like KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance; on primary R/R/A cells). Headers use abbreviations + parens (AM etc.) vs. ground truth full names only. Extra unwarranted title ("RACI Matrix – Order-to-Cash Workflow") and incomplete legend (omits I=Informed; ground truth has no legend).
  - **Overall fidelity**: ~17% exact cell matches; structure similar but content/format diverges substantially. Rubric notes satisfied for terms/R count but not full allocations vs. ground truth.
- **Score justification**: Base 7.0 for terms/structure/R positions, -3.0 for incompleteness/blanks/missing I/C/A. Utmost strictness applied—small formatting errors (no bold, headers) compound to further loss.
