The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility due to absent timestamp data and provides a concise explanation, but it loses a full point for minor phrasing differences from the ground truth (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; omission of explicit reference to "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals" as the core missing elements for cycle time calculation).
