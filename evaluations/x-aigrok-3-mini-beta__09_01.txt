The LLM answer is fully correct. It explicitly states that the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived due to the absence of timestamps or elapsed-time fields, which is exactly the conclusion reached in the ground-truth answer. The reasoning matches the essential pointsâ€”no temporal data is present, benchmarks cannot be used, and any numeric answer would be fabricated. There are no factual or logical errors or omissions. Therefore, this is a perfect response.
