1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth and prompt requirements, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key failures include:

- **Missing core elements**: No task for "Forward to Specialist" (required by lines 5-6), no exclusive gateway for customer confirmation (line 8-9 requires a decision point), and incorrect modeling of the specialist path (gw2 incorrectly routes to "Confirm with Customer" instead of forwarding then resolving).
- **Incorrect flows and logic**: After "Provide Reset Instructions", flow goes to "Resolve Issue" (flow4), bypassing confirmation as per lines 3 and 7; the re-work loop (line 9) uses an invalid sourceRef="flow10_conditional" with nonsensical XPath placeholder, failing to properly loop from confirmation back to "Initial Diagnosis".
- **Structural and XML errors**: Only two gateways modeled, but ground truth requires three (gw1, gw2, gw3); extra unnecessary namespaces (bpmndi, omgdc, omgdi) violate "no diagram/interchange elements"; invalid sequenceFlow (flow11); process attributes mismatch (e.g., isClosure="true" vs. isExecutable="false").
- **Naming and conciseness issues**: Names like "Resolve or Escalate?" (gw2) and "Automatically classify ticket" deviate from exact phrasing; IDs and overall structure don't align; added explanatory note outside the required single <definitions> block.
- **Overall fidelity**: The model hallucinates connections (e.g., direct gw2 to confirm) and omits explicit conditionExpressions (e.g., "yes"/"no" as in ground truth), resulting in a non-functional BPMN representation of the described process. Even minor mismatches (e.g., start event name "Customer submits support ticket" vs. "Ticket Submitted") compound the errors, but the major omissions alone justify zero partial credit.
