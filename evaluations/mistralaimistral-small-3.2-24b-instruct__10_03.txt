4.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer partially adheres to the core vocabulary policy by correctly using "Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," and "Risk Scoring" in the table without disallowed synonyms leaking in. It also avoids renaming or merging the four mandated activities. However, significant deviations from the ground truth and prompt instructions result in a low score, as per the strict criteria (even small errors incur major point loss). Key issues:

- **Added/Invented Activities (Major Violation, -3.0 points)**: The prompt explicitly states "do not ... add activities." The LLM adds four new ones ("Approval (if score >70)," "Payment Scheduling," "Payment Release," "Notification to Analyst"), which are not in the ground truth and split/infer the narrative incorrectly (e.g., narrative combines scheduling/release/notification under Treasury Ops). Ground truth derives only two additional activities ("Compliance Officer Approval," "Release Funds") more faithfully from the narrative without over-splitting.

- **Incomplete/Mismatched RACI Assignments (-2.0 points)**: Assignments differ substantially from ground truth, ignoring broader involvement (e.g., Consulted/Informed roles). Examples:
  - Intake Vetting: LLM assigns only "Responsible" to Front-Office Analyst (sparse); ground truth specifies R,A for Front-Office, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury Ops.
  - KYC Review/AML Screening: LLM assigns only "Responsible" to Compliance Analyst; ground truth adds R,A for Compliance Analyst, C for Compliance Officer, I for Treasury Ops.
  - Risk Scoring: Partial match (Compliance Analyst R, Officer A), but misses ground truth's C for Front-Office Analyst and I for Treasury Ops.
  - No equivalents for ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" (I for Front-Office, C for Compliance Analyst, R,A for Officer) or "Release Funds" (I for Front-Office, C for Analyst/Officer, R,A for Treasury).
  - Empty cells imply no involvement but contradict ground truth's explicit Consulted/Informed across roles, underrepresenting process interconnections.
  - Conditional phrasing in "Approval (if score >70)" deviates from ground truth's neutral "Compliance Officer Approval."

- **Formatting and Output Structure Errors (-0.5 points)**: 
  - Uses blank cells instead of ground truth's dashes (â€“) for no involvement.
  - Lacks bolding for activities/roles as in ground truth.
  - Includes explanatory "Notes" section (unnecessary and interpretive, e.g., explaining replacements despite policy allowing them in context), while ground truth has concise "Key points" focused on policy adherence.

- **Partial Strengths (+1.0 point buffer)**: Correctly maps narrative to the four authorized terms without synonyms. Table is Markdown as required. Covers all roles, though inaccurately.

Overall, the answer captures the vocabulary intent but fails on fidelity to the process narrative, RACI depth, and instruction adherence, making it substantially different from the ground truth (e.g., 8 vs. 6 activities, sparse vs. detailed assignments). This warrants a failing-to-mediocre score under utmost strictness.
