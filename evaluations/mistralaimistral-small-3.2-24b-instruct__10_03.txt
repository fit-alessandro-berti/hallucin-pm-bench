4.5

The LLM answer largely follows the vocabulary policy and does not output disallowed synonyms, which is a positive. It also attempts to present a RACI matrix in Markdown table format covering the stated roles and activities.

However, there are several critical deviations from the ground truth, and each results in a significant point deduction due to the strict grading policy:

1. **Activity Naming and Structure**:
   - The LLM output invents or changes activity names not in the ground truth: e.g., "Approval (if score >70)", "Payment Scheduling", "Payment Release", and "Notification to Analyst". The ground truth did not ask for splitting "Release Funds" into "Payment Scheduling" and "Payment Release".
   - The ground truth specifically required that activities must not be renamed, merged, or added. The LLM did not comply.

2. **RACI Assignment Errors**:
   - The Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), Informed (I) assignments do not match the ground truth in critical ways:
     - The LLM omits "Accountable" and "Responsible" on the same line when needed ("R, A" in ground truth).
     - For "Risk Scoring", the ground truth says Compliance Analyst = R, Compliance Officer = A, but LLM has Compliance Analyst as Responsible and Compliance Officer as Accountable only if escalated, creating ambiguity.
     - For "Compliance Officer Approval", ground truth = Compliance Officer is both R and A, but LLM only marks as Accountable.
     - The Consultation (C) and Informed (I) fields are not filled in accordance with ground truth (multiple omissions or misassignments).
     - The ground truth marks Front-OfficeAnalyst as C for Risk Scoring, which is missing from LLM output.

3. **Format Discrepancies**:
   - Uses an inconsistent format for RACI assignments—ground truth uses "R, A" if a role covers both.
   - Omits dash (–) for roles not involved; uses empty cells instead, in violation of instructions.

4. **Matrix Completeness**:
   - The ground truth matrix is exhaustive and granular about each process stage. The LLM answer omits "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" as discrete activities. The extra/incorrect activities ("Payment Scheduling", "Payment Release", "Notification to Analyst") do not exist in the ground truth.

5. **Notes Section**:
   - While explanatory notes are not prohibited, their inclusion is unnecessary as the request was only for the matrix. Additionally, a subtle policy breach may be present since the activity mapping references the forbidden synonyms ("Preliminary Assessment", "Sanctions Check", etc.)—even though this was only in the notes, the policy says not to output them "even in explanations".

**Summary of deductions:**  
- Major loss for renaming/splitting activities (violates explicit instructions).
- Severe deduction for RACI assignment errors.
- Non-compliance with matrix formatting rules.
- Some credit for correct vocabulary usage (in the main matrix), and clear attempt at structure.

Hence, a score of 4.5/10 is warranted for this response, reflecting a significant departure from strict requirements despite not being a total failure.
