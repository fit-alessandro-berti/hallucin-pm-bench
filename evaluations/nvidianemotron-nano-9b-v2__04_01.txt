7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of overall conclusion (Non-compliant)**: Fully matches ground truth (+2.0 base).
- **Identification of violations**: Correctly identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with accurate descriptions of the issues (e.g., Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods; Three_way_match too far from Goods_Received). Citations to rules are clear (+2.0).
- **Comprehensiveness**: Only addresses violating rules; omits explicit checks for satisfied Rules 1, 4, and 5 (e.g., no mention of PO approvals, Intern role sequencing, or final Archive_Record), which ground truth covers exhaustively. This makes it incomplete relative to the thorough rule-by-rule structure in ground truth (-1.5).
- **Factual accuracy in details**: Minor but clear error in Rule 3 distance ("4 activities away" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"). While the violation conclusion holds, the numerical discrepancy is a small error warranting deduction under strict criteria (-1.0). No other factual issues.
- **Format and clarity**: Follows the required "Non-compliant" + numbered justification format adequately, but lacks the detailed, rule-numbered breakdown (1-5) and explanatory depth of ground truth (e.g., no event references for all rules) (-0.5).
- **Strictness adjustment**: Even minor gaps and the distance error reflect significant incompleteness in a compliance audit context, where verifying all rules is essential. Total deductions prevent a higher score.
