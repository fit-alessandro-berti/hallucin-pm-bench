The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B, lists them in the required alphabetical order (both overall and within pairs), and uses the specified format with appropriate spacing around the em dash. However, it lacks the column alignment formatting present in the ground truth (extra leading and mid-line spaces in the second pair for visual alignment), which constitutes a minor but noticeable difference in output presentation. Under strict evaluation criteria, this results in a deduction, though the content and structure are otherwise identical to the ground truth.
