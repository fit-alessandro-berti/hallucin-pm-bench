7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in identifying the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, with identical quantifications of excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and accurate inclusion of waiting times and case volumes from the data. The structure adheres to the prompt: an executive memo format with bullet points exclusively for recommendations, grounded solely in provided metrics without inventing activities or extraneous details (e.g., no fabricated total cases, dates, or projections like the ground truth's "4 805 completed cases" or "35% reduction"). Headers are functionally similar, though phrasing differs slightly (e.g., "From" line aligns better with the system role as "senior process-performance analyst" vs. ground truth's "Process Performance Office"; subject is relevant but not identical).

However, significant deductions for deviations in the recommendations section, a core prompt requirement: the LLM's actions (e.g., "reallocate capacity," "revise review scope," "standardize assessment steps") are data-driven by referencing specific throughput/waiting times but lack the concrete specificity of the ground truth's (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks for bypass," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"), making them comparatively generic and less actionable. The introductory phrasing and overall tone also diverge (e.g., LLM's "weakest activities" vs. ground truth's "materially breach... accumulating the largest queues"), introducing minor stylistic mismatches. Word count is approximate (LLM ~180 words vs. ground truth ~140), but this is negligible. No major policy violations or inventions, but the recommendation differences alone warrant a 2.5-point loss from a potential 10 for imperfect alignment under strict criteria.
