The LLM answer accurately recognizes that none of the requested metrics can be computed from the available data, clearly referencing the lack of event rows and timestamps in Artefact A. It also correctly notes that Artefact B's SLA information is historical and insufficient for calculation. However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer is slightly more verbose and lacks the explicit technical detail that "neither the average cycle time nor its dispersion or confidence interval can be calculated," as well as the mention that raw log entries are explicitly required. The essential technical explanation is present but phrased less precisely, resulting in a minor point deduction.
