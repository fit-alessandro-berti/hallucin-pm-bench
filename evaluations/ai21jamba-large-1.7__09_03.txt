The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth by correctly identifying the impossibility of computation due to the redacted event log in Artefact A, emphasizing the absence of rows and timestamps needed for "Approve Invoice" metrics. It precisely explains the limitations without guessing or using external knowledge, fulfilling Task 3 in one short paragraph. Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary but accurate mention of Artefact B's irrelevance (ground truth omits this, focusing solely on the log); (2) use of bold markdown (**), violating the "plain text" instruction; and (3) slightly less concise phrasing (e.g., "complete absence of rows and timestamps" vs. ground truth's direct "all event rows and every timestamp... have been redacted"). These small stylistic differences warrant a strict but not severe penalty.
