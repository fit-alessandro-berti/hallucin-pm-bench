3.0

**Rationale:**

**a) Decision Points**  
- The LLM answer introduces three "decision points," with significant redundancy and imprecision:  
  - It splits steps 3 and 4 into two separate points when, per ground truth, the only actual gating logic happens after the risk score *and* amount check (a single composite branch).
  - The answer inaccurately suggests that Step 3 is itself a decision gate, when the process description makes clear that the gating logic is the conditional in Step 4 (based on both risk and amount).
  - The wording and structure obscure that the branch is "if (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND amount ≤ €250,000) skip Step 5, else do Step 5," as in the ground truth.
  - The “TriVote” point is summarized correctly, but its phrasing is less precise than the ground truth.

**b) Required Documents**  
- The list is incomplete and erroneous:  
  - It omits three required documents present in the ground truth and process description:  
    - Scorecard–Cyan  
    - Scorecard–Magenta  
    - Scorecard–Yellow  
    - Signed Offer Sheet 77 (the LLM conflates Offer Sheet 77 with its signed version—these are separate process artifacts per ground truth).  
  - The ordering is incorrect (for example, ID Matrix Declaration is needed alongside Signed Offer Sheet 77, and the LLM puts it after the unsigned offer).
- The LLM avoids hallucinations regarding KYC/AML.
- It does include the core forms (Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, Loan Dossier 2025), but omitting four documents is a major factual error.

**Strictness:**  
- Each major error (splitting decision points, omitting documents) results in a large deduction.
- Minor imprecision in phrasing also warrants a deduction as instructed.

**Score justification:**  
- Fundamental process control logic is only partially correct.
- Nearly half the required documents are omitted or conflated.
- Therefore, the answer deserves a low score of **3.0**—it is not wholly incorrect, but has severe omissions and enough distortion to be judged strictly unsatisfactory.
