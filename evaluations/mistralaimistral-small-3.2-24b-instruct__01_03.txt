### Evaluation Score: 3.5

#### Reasoning for Score (Strict Assessment)
I evaluated the LLM answer against the ground truth with utmost strictness, penalizing even minor deviations in structure, accuracy, completeness, and fidelity to the process description. The score reflects substantial mismatches: partial accuracy in part (a) but critical omissions and errors in part (b), which dominates the downgrade due to its incompleteness.

- **Part (a) – Decision Points (approx. 40% of score weight; partial credit: ~5.0/10)**:
  - Ground truth identifies exactly **two** decision points: (1) the conditional skip after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (combining the outcome and threshold into one rule), and (2) the TriVote gate with its "at least two approvals" rule phrased precisely as needing "Approve" records from two of three specific roles.
  - LLM correctly identifies the TriVote (point 3) with accurate phrasing on the two-out-of-three rule, earning credit here.
  - However, LLM incorrectly splits the risk assessment into **three** points, fabricating a "decision" in Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) that doesn't exist—Step 3 is purely input-based outcome generation, not a gate/branch. The actual conditional branch is solely in Step 4, which ground truth consolidates as one point.
  - LLM's Step 3 description inaccurately bundles the amount threshold into it ("if risk is High or amount > €250,000"), introducing a logical equivalence that's not in the process (the amount check is explicitly AND-ed with risk in Step 4). Step 4 point is mostly accurate but redundant due to the split.
  - This over-identification (extra point), misattribution to steps, and non-exact phrasing (e.g., no mention of "bypass/proceed" or "record 'Approve'") are small but significant errors under strict criteria, costing points for deviation from the ground truth's concise, exact structure (one sentence per true point).

- **Part (b) – Documents List (approx. 60% of score weight; low credit: ~2.0/10)**:
  - Ground truth lists **nine** documents in precise first-appearance order, including the three Scorecards (as explicit inputs to Step 3), separating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (Step 8 output) from "Offer Sheet 77" (Step 7), and ensuring completeness without hallucinations.
  - LLM lists only **five** documents, omitting four critical ones: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow (directly required as inputs in Step 3's Tri-Color-Risk-Check), and Signed Offer Sheet 77 (explicitly in Step 8).
  - Order is partially correct for the listed items (Form 14B first, Deck Memo before Offer Sheet 77), but the omissions make it incomplete and misleading—e.g., no recognition that Scorecards are "required anywhere" as process inputs, nor the distinction for the signed offer (which ground truth treats as a separate document event).
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML), but incompleteness is a major error, violating the "all documents" requirement and first-appearance sequencing. Under strictness, missing ~44% of items (4/9) incurs severe penalties, as even small oversights should reflect significantly.

- **Overall Deductions**:
  - Structure: LLM uses bullet points and numbering, which is clear but deviates from ground truth's plain formatting—minor, but strictness docks for non-matching presentation.
  - Fidelity: LLM stays within the process description (no external inventions), but fails to capture every element precisely, especially in completeness.
  - Total: The part (b) failures dominate, pulling the score down sharply from a potential 7.0 (for part (a) alone) to 3.5. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, differences are too numerous and impactful for higher.
