The LLM answer is factually correct, provides the exact same minimal sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), and a concise valid explanation matching the ground truth's core logic (alternative path fills P5 via P1 without consuming P2). It stays under 120 words.

Minor deductions (-0.8): lacks explicit Q1/Q2 structure, numbered list with markings (M1–M5 for proof), and note on T5 disabling T3 afterward. These add precision in ground truth but are not required by prompt; still, strict comparison penalizes omissions.
