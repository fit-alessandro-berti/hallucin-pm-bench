The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and identifies the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order) as the ground truth, with accurate citations to lines and case-IDs, fully disproving the claim in a single paragraph as prompted. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (one continuous paragraph vs. bulleted list; phrasing "without any preceding Receive_Order" vs. more direct "never contains Receive_Order at all"; unnecessary mention of Cancel_Order on line 12; use of en dash "6–7" vs. separate line mentions), which introduce small unnecessary details and less precise wording under utmost strictness.
