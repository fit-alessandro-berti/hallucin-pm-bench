7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, with no differences in values or format. This demonstrates accurate extraction of facts from the log fragment (distinct cases: 3; preceding activity: "Pack_Items"; earliest timestamp: correctly identified and formatted; "Quality_Check" occurrences: 2).

However, Q5 shows a clear and significant error: the LLM lists only two activities ("Pack_Items", "Validate_Order") that never appear as first events, omitting "Ship_Order" despite it never starting any case (all first events are "Receive_Order" or "Quality_Check"). This incompleteness violates the requirement to list **every** such activity, representing a factual omission directly inferable from the log. The list order is irrelevant per the schema, but the missing item is a major deviation.

Under strict evaluation, this error in one question (but a key one involving enumeration of all relevant items) warrants a substantial deduction despite perfection elsewhere. The overall answer is 80% correct by question count (4/5 perfect) but critically incomplete in Q5 (2/3 items), averaging to a 7.0 score. No other issues (e.g., format, extraneous content, or violations of the JSON schema) are present.
