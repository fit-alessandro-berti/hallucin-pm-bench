### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in structure (memo-like format with clear identification, explanations, and recommendations), content (same three activities: Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment, selected via comparable metrics like high wait/processing times, rework, and SLA breaches), and adherence to constraints (strictly table-based, no absent activities mentioned, concise at ~180 words, no guessing on unclear differentiations). Explanations accurately cite table data (e.g., wait times, throughput drops, rework/SLA rates) without fabrication.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- **Format tweaks** (-0.3): Email-style "To:" and subject line vs. ground truth's simpler title; prompt specifies "executive memo," making this a subtle stylistic deviation.
- **Explanation nuances** (-0.2): Phrasing like "early-stage friction" for Initial_Assessment is interpretive but table-supported; ground truth ties it more explicitly to "feeding later congestion," a small loss in precision.
- **Recommendations** (-0.3): Concrete and data-driven (e.g., specific targets like "stdev from 9â†’5") but diverge in details (e.g., LLM's "standardized checklist" vs. ground truth's "automatic digital requests"; LLM's triage vs. "AI-assisted"). These are valid alternatives but not identical, reducing exactness under strict rubric.
- **Absence of projection** (-0.0, no deduction): Ground truth adds an overall impact summary; LLM omits it, but prompt doesn't require it.

No major errors, hallucinations, or off-topic elements; high fidelity overall.
