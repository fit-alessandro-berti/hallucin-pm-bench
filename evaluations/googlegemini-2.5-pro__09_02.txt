The LLM answer accurately captures the core reasoning and conclusion of the ground truth—that the average cycle time cannot be calculated due to the absence of timestamps—while being similarly concise. However, it deducts 0.5 points for minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and omission of explicit reference to "start-to-completion intervals" or "duration information"), which introduce slight semantic and structural variations under strict evaluation criteria.
