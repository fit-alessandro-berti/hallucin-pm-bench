The LLM answer is correct in its verdict ("No") and its overall justification, pinpointing C002 and C004 as counterexamples and noting the presence (or absence) of an immediate succession in these cases. However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer lacks a case-by-case tabular breakdown explicitly showing both compliant and non-compliant cases, as well as a structured summary. The LLM also makes a minor superfluous comment regarding C003 ("Ship_Order" after "Validate_Payment"â€”which the ground truth rightly ignores as irrelevant), which slightly detracts from the precision and focus. These small differences merit a full point deduction, but the core evaluation and justifications reflect the evidence in the log and reasoning is otherwise solid.
