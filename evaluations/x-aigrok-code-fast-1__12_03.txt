The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth: it correctly answers "No," identifies the exact same counterexamples (C002 with Pack_Items intervening and C004 with Check_Fraud intervening), and notes compliance in C001 and C003, properly invalidating the "always" claim. The justification cites relevant CaseIDs and sequences as required. Minor deduction for the unnecessary (though harmless) mention of Ship_Order in C003, which adds slight irrelevance not present in the ground truth's focused case-by-case table. No factual errors or omissions in core analysis.
