6.0

The LLM answer demonstrates a strong executive memo structure, but suffers several critical issues:

1. **Incorrect Activity Selection** (Major Issue):  
   - The correct ranking from the table (by average waiting time) is:
     1. Request_Documents (36.5h, 120.0h)
     2. Send_Closure_Letter (12.2h, 44.0h)
     3. Assess_Liability (7.8h, 16.4h)
   - The LLM memo incorrectly lists "Approve_Payment" (3.2h, 9.7h) as #3, omitting the actual third-worst, "Send_Closure_Letter".
   - This is a substantial error and must result in a significant deduction.

2. **Quoting Figures** (Minor Issue):  
   - The waiting times for listed activities are quoted accurately for those chosen.
   - However, since the wrong activity ("Approve_Payment") is included, its mention is not compliant.

3. **Recommended Actions** (Moderate Issue):  
   - Actions for "Request_Documents" and "Assess_Liability" are plausible, but for "Approve_Payment", it's irrelevant (as this is the wrong activity).
   - Concrete, data-driven actions are cited, but none for "Send_Closure_Letter", which is required.

4. **Adherence to Instructions** (Minor to Moderate Issue):  
   - The memo slightly exceeds 120 words, but within the 150-word constraint.
   - The memo only discusses waiting times, not service or throughput, which is correct.

**Summary**: The core error is the omission of "Send_Closure_Letter" and inclusion of "Approve_Payment"â€”a serious mistake for this prompt. The actions and figures for actual included activities are reasonable (though not as specific as ground truth). Strict grading demands a strong penalty for the ranking and omission error, but the memo otherwise follows format and is clearly written.

**Deduction breakdown:**  
- Major deduction for misranking/omission of correct activity: -3 pts  
- Action for omitted activity missing: -0.5 pt  
- Minor deduction for actions being less data-driven/specific than ground truth: -0.5 pt

**Final score: 6.0**
