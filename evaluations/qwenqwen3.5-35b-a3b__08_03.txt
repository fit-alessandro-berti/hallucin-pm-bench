**6.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" and provides a valid 4-step sequence enabling T5 without firing T3, accurately describing markings, shortcut via T2b, mutual exclusivity of T2/T2b, independent paths, and even notes the feedback loop (T6 requires T5). However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:

- **Major differences**: Provides a 4-step sequence (T1, T4, T2b, T5) instead of the 6-step (T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3). Explicitly stops at T5 claiming it "demonstrates" T5 before T3 while noting "T3 is not fired," missing the ground truth's requirement to show both firing with T5 before T3 via feedback (T6 to enable pc for T3 post-T5). Claims length 4 "shortest demonstrating the possibility" vs. ground truth's justified 6 as minimal for the order including T3.
- **Sequence errors**: Different order of concurrent T4/T2b (valid but not matching); omits T6/T3 entirely.
- **Explanation differences**: Lacks ground truth's bullets on why shortcut skips pc/T3, feedback re-enables T3 after T5, and precise lower bound reasoning tying extra steps to post-T5 pc production. LLM's phrasing implies T3 never needs to fire for proof, diverging from ground truth's full demonstration.
- **Minor**: Notation (p_a vs pa), structure (numbered verification vs inline), but these compound under strictness.

These are not small errors—the core sequence and proof of order (both firing) fundamentally mismatch, warranting major deduction despite technical validity under alternate interpretation.
