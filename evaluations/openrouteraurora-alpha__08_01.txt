**9.2**

The LLM answer is factually correct, provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1-T2-T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, includes precise full markings in a table, and offers a brief, accurate justification of enabling conditions matching the prompt's requirements. It correctly notes p4=0 (enabling T5 via inhibitor) and p2 still holding the token for future T3.

**Penalties for differences (strict evaluation):**
- **-0.5**: Misses ground truth's deeper insight ("must fire before T3 if it occurs"; permanent disablement post-T3; only reachable enabling states pre-T3). Provides only basic enabling justification, not the fuller structural proof.
- **-0.3**: Sequence stops at T5 (sufficient but less explicit than ground truth's post-T5 T3 firing). Does not continue to illustrate T3 after.
- **-0.2**: Minor table formatting inconsistency (step column mixes "M0" with transition names "T1/T2/T5" instead of consistent "M1/M2/M3"; mismatches the diagram line above table).
- **-0.1**: Phrasing lacks ground truth's conditional "if it is ever to occur" and overall more concise/insightful tone.
- **+Bonus ignored**: LLM avoids ground truth's error (invalid T4 firing post-T5-T3, as p3=0 prevents it); superior in accuracy there.

No factual errors; highly effective response overall, but strict diff-based grading deducts for non-identical content/structure/depth.
