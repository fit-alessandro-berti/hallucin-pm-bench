The LLM answer is highly accurate, directly addressing the prompt by providing a clear verdict ("No, the fact is not accurate") and a short, evidence-based justification citing all relevant case IDs (1001, 1002, 1003) and activities with precise sequences that demonstrate the reversal or absence, correctly disproving the "always" and "immediately before" claims. It matches the ground truth in core content, structure (case-by-case breakdown), and conclusion without factual errors or omissions. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: slightly less formal structure (no explicit "verdict" header or line number citations, though not required by the prompt) and abbreviated sequences (using "..." instead of full paths), which introduce negligible ambiguity under strict scrutiny.
