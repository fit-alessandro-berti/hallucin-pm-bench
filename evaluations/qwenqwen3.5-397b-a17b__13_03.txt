9.0

**Rationale**: Q1 is identical (perfect). Q2 covers core ideas (small sample of 3 cases/single morning = unreliable; naming inconsistencies with exact examples; exact matching misses variants; selection bias risk) in <120 words, aligning ~85% with ground truth. Strong on extrapolation error and bias. Deductions (-1.0 total): lacks precise quantification (14 events, <2h span, 0-7% swing, wide CI, rare-event sampling error emphasis); doesn't specify occurrence details in Q2 or warn explicitly on fuzzy over-inclusion; slightly more general vs. ground truth's vivid metrics. Strict but not identical.
