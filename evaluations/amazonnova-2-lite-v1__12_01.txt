**9.2**

The LLM answer is factually accurate, correctly identifies the claim as inaccurate, and provides evidence-based justification for all three cases matching the ground truth (reversed order in 1001/1003; absence in 1002 disproving "always"). Citations to case IDs and activities are precise, with full sequences aiding clarity without errors or guesses.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total):**
- Slightly verbose (full activity lists and repeated phrasing like "contradicts"/"❌" exceed "short justification"; ground truth is more concise).
- Extra details (e.g., Quality_Check mention, emojis, headings) not in ground truth, though harmless.
- No line numbers (ground truth cites "lines 3-4", etc.), a small omission in strict citation matching.

No factual errors; high fidelity overall under strict evaluation.
