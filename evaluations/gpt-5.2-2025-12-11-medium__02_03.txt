9.5  
- Q1: Matches content exactly (3 cases, same list), minor deduction for restating "Distinct cases:" and bolding (less concise than ground truth).  
- Q2: Matches answer exactly, minor deduction for restating full question phrasing ("activity immediately before").  
- Q3: Exact match.  
Overall: Perfect factual accuracy, bullet-point format followed, but slight verbosity and formatting variance vs. ground truth's ultra-concise style deducts 0.5 under strict criteria.
