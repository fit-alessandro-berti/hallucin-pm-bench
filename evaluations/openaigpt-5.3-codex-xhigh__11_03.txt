**5.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s), matching ground truth precisely in selection, order, and quantification. Uses only table data/metrics. Bullet points used *only* for recommendations. ~150 words.
- **Major differences (significant deductions)**:
  - **Structure/Formatting**: Lacks executive memo headers (To/From/Subject), subject line, bolding/italics, and "Recommended actions" subheader; starts informally with "COO," vs. ground truth's polished format (-1.5).
  - **Content/Phrasing**: Intro paragraph rephrases identification differently (e.g., "priority bottlenecks... combine largest overruns" vs. "materially breach... largest queues"); no total cases mention or end-to-end projection (-1.0).
  - **Recommendations**: Completely different actions (queue caps/escalations with precise wait reductions and case counts vs. bypass pre-checks/add analyst/straight-through heuristic); LLM's are more data-tied but diverge entirely in content and wording (-2.0).
- **Strictness applied**: Even though LLM fulfills prompt requirements and is arguably better grounded, textual differences (especially recs as ~40% of content) warrant substantial loss per instructions. No small errors overlooked.
