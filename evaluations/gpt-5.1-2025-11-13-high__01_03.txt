7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, focusing on fidelity to the prompt's requirements (summarizing decision points as gates/conditionals with one-sentence rules each for **a**; listing all documents in first-appearance order for **b**). Differences in completeness, accuracy, and adherence to the process description result in deductions, with even minor structural issues weighted heavily.

- **Part a (Decision Points)**: Score 6.0/10.  
  The ground truth identifies exactly two decision points: (1) the risk/amount conditional branch (step 4), and (2) the TriVote gate (step 6). The LLM correctly describes these two but commits a significant error by adding a third ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check" as a decision point), which is not a gate or conditional—it's a procedural step (step 3) that generates an input for the actual conditional in step 4. This inflates the count and misrepresents the process, violating the "every decision point" instruction. Descriptions of the valid points are accurate and concise (matching the one-sentence rule format), with no hallucinations, but the extraneous point causes a major deduction for incompleteness in identification.

- **Part b (Documents)**: Score 10.0/10.  
  Exact match to the ground truth: all nine documents listed in precise first-appearance order, with no additions, omissions, or hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML items).

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average (equal parts for a and b) = (6.0 + 10.0)/2 = 8.0, adjusted down to 7.5 for the holistic impact of the structural error in **a** (adding ~50% more points than ground truth, which distorts the summary). No other issues like verbosity or off-topic content.
