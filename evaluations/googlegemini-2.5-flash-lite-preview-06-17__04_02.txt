6.0

### Evaluation Notes:
- **Strengths**: Correct status for R1, R3, R4, R6; justifications concise and â‰¤20 words; correct overall NON-COMPLIANT (though based on incomplete violations).
- **Weaknesses**: R5 completely mismatches (Compliant vs. Violated; ignores that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice precede new Manager_Approval, violating "before any further processing"). R2 status correct but justification factually wrong (misidentifies last approval as 03-04, incorrectly claims >2 days when it's ~1 day; fails to account for change requiring new approval on 03-07). These are major analytical errors under strict criteria, causing ~40% deviation from ground truth. Format is acceptable but less structured than ground truth table.
