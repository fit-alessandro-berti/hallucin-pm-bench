6.0

Rationale:

- R1: Correct (Compliant).  
- R2: **Incorrect justification**. The LLM evaluated the 2-day window from the original Finance_Approval, instead of from the new Manager_Approval required after the Change_Request (per ground truth and rule intent). LLM missed the rule’s dependency on R5 for “last required approval.” Significant error.
- R3: Correct (Violated).
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable).
- R5: **Incorrect**. Ruled Compliant when it was Violated: after Change_Request, Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before new Manager_Approval. LLM overlooked the event order. This is a serious compliance logic error.
- R6: Correct (Compliant).
- Overall result: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).

Summary: 3 rules incorrect (R2 and R5 substantive, R2 justification especially), others correct. No major format errors, but critical logical misses.  
**Strict grading:** −2 fully correct, −3 minor justification error, −3 major R5 logic error, −1 for overall strictness → 6.0.
