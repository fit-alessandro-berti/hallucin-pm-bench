9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks and lists them in the proper order. The task names precisely match those in Process B, and no extraneous information is given about Processes A or C, in keeping with the promptâ€™s instructions.

However, the answer omits explicit association of each set with "first/second parallel block" (as the ground truth does), and does not clearly state that "no other tasks can run in parallel," which is included in the ground truth. These are minor omissions but represent a lack of exhaustive detail and explicit connection to the process structure highlighted in the ground truth. Thus, a deduction is warranted for strictness, resulting in a 9.0.
