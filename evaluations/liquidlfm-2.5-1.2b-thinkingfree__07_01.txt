**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and fails on multiple levels with utmost strictness applied:

- **Factual errors (major deductions)**: 
  - Added tasks: Lists only `check_vip` (partial credit for id), misses `generate_qr` entirely.
  - Removed tasks: Incorrectly lists `validate_warranty` (still present in v2 after `check_vip`), misses actual removal `send_rma_label`.
  - Gateway type changes: Claims "none" (or variants), completely misses the explicit change `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` (v1) to `inclusiveGateway` (v2).

- **Format violations**:
  - Does not use exact required headings with bullets (• Added tasks, etc.).
  - Uses inconsistent "none" instead of "(none)" even if applicable (but irrelevant here as changes exist).
  - Provides only ids, not names as in ground truth (e.g., no "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)" format); instruction specifies "element names exactly as they appear," but output ignores names.
  - Response is unstructured reasoning dump, not clean grouped list.

- **Other**: Speculates excessively in visible reasoning (violates "Do **not** speculate"). No adherence to "only the factual differences." Total mismatch to ground truth content and structure justifies minimum score.
