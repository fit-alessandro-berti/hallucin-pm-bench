8.0

The LLM answer is correct for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. For Q5, it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" among the activities that never appear as the first event of any case. In fact, "Quality_Check" is the first and only event for case C-77 (per the log fragment). All other items in Q5 are correct.

Since one activity is mistakenly included in Q5 and all other answers are perfect, the error is moderate (but significant because it indicates a lack of careful analysis of first events), warranting a penalty of 2 points. Thus, the proper score is 8.0.
