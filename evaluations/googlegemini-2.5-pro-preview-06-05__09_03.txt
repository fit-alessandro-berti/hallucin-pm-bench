9.2

The LLM answer is thorough and clear, and it does not introduce information not present in the artefacts. It correctly explains why none of the requested metrics can be computed, referencing the absence of timestamps for "Approve Invoice" or any activity, which matches the core of the ground truth answer.

Differences from the ground truth:

- The ground truth answer is more concise and direct, especially in its first word, "Impossible," providing a punchy, immediate response.
- The LLM answer elaborates more on the technical reason (i.e., need for actual event data for all instances, not just absence of timestamps), and mentions the irrelevance of metrics from Artefact B more explicitly.
- The ground truth emphasizes the exact column headers and their absence of data, and specifies that both average and all statistics (dispersion/confidence intervals) cannot be computed for “Approve Invoice” specifically.
- The LLM answer says “cannot compute any metric exactly...” which is very close, but not as blunt as stating computation is "impossible." 

These distinctions are minor, but since strict grading is requested and even small errors necessitate a substantial deduction, I subtract ~0.8 points mainly for lack of maximal conciseness and slightly less directness compared to the ground truth. Otherwise, the answer is correct and free of factual or inferential errors.
