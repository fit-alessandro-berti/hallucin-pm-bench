The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of computation due to redacted data and ties it to timestamps for "Approve Invoice," aligning with the core reasoning in the ground truth. However, it incurs point deductions for: (1) deviating from the task's instruction to provide the reason "in one short paragraph" by using a numbered 1-2-3 structure (repetitive and not plain prose); (2) less precise language (e.g., "these values are redacted" implies partial data exists, omitting explicit "all event rows... removed" and "no concrete times for any 'Approve Invoice' execution"); (3) failure to concisely cover all metrics ("dispersion or confidence interval") in one block or suggest "additional raw log entries required"; (4) minor over-explanation in points 1-2 instead of jumping to the single explanatory paragraph. These format, precision, and concision gaps represent small but significant errors under strict evaluation.
