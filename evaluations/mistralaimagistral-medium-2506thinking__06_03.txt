The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets in Process B, matching the ground truth in content and order: (1) Quality_Check and Update_Inventory; (2) Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement. It also appropriately notes these are the only parallel sets, aligning with the ground truth's closing statement. However, significant deductions are warranted for the following strict evaluation criteria:

- **Extra unnecessary content (major deduction: -1.5 points):** The prompt requires a focused list of sets without additional explanation. The LLM includes a verbose "Summary of Reasoning and Final Answer" section, which introduces unrequested analysis (e.g., explaining splits and concurrency), violating the instruction to simply "list each set." This exceeds the ground truth's concise structure.

- **Formatting inconsistencies and errors (major deduction: -1.0 points):** 
  - Uses commas instead of the ground truth's ‖ symbol for parallelism, slightly altering readability and precision.
  - The first \boxed{} is malformed (e.g., trailing comma after "Update_Inventory" and awkward LaTeX spacing), reducing clarity.
  - The second \boxed{1, 2} is entirely erroneous and irrelevant, appearing to mistakenly summarize sets as mere numbers without tasks, which directly contradicts the prompt's requirement to list tasks.

- **Minor structural mismatches (minor deduction: -0.5 points):** Lacks the ground truth's bolded "Set 1 – first parallel block:" labeling and code-style task formatting (e.g., `Quality_Check`), making it less precise and professional. The phrase "Each set is ordered by their appearance" is redundant and not in the ground truth.

Overall, the core factual accuracy is strong (no incorrect tasks or sets), but the extras, errors, and lack of exact formatting fidelity justify a mid-high score rather than perfect, per the strictness mandate.
