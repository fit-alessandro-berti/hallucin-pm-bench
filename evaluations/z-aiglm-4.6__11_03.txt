### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies the excesses (+300s for the first two, +60s for the third) using table data. It grounds descriptions in provided metrics (throughput and waiting times) without inventing absent activities or metrics, and uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations as instructed. The memo format is present, though word count is slightly under (~120 words vs. ~150 target).

However, significant deductions apply under strict criteria:
- **Structure and Completeness (major loss: -2.5 points)**: Headers differ substantially (e.g., "COO" vs. "Chief Operating Officer"; generic subject without context like "Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)"; "From" mismatches role/office). Lacks ground truth's introductory case total (4,805 cases, derivable from data) and closing projection on impact (e.g., 35% cycle time reduction). No bolding/emphasis for activities or section headers, reducing executive polish.
- **Quantification Presentation (moderate loss: -1.0 point)**: Excesses are stated but not formatted as precisely (e.g., no "average throughput **900 s** vs. 600 s SLA (+300 s)" side-by-side comparison per activity; waiting times bundled in paragraph rather than per-activity bullets).
- **Recommendations (major loss: -1.5 points)**: Bullets are used correctly, but actions lack concreteness and data-driven specificity compared to ground truth (e.g., LLM's vague "allocate additional resources" or "investigate resourcing" vs. targeted "introduce rule-based pre-checks" or "add one risk analyst to peak morning window"). While LLM ties to waiting times (data-grounded), it adds unprompted calculation (80% of throughput) without broader impact projection, and recommendations feel generic rather than innovative/actionable.
- **Overall Fidelity (cumulative minor errors: -0.5 point)**: Minor phrasing issues (e.g., "exceed their SLAs by 300 seconds" implies throughput without explicit vs. SLA breakdown; order of activities slightly off) compound to show incomplete alignment, treating small deviations as warranting notable penalties per instructions.

This results in a middling score: core requirements met but with clear gaps in precision, depth, and polish relative to the ground truth.
