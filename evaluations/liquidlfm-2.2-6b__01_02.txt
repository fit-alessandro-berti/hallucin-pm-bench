### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points Section (Major Errors, ~2.5/10 weight)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 precise branching decisions (Underwriter Alignment Gate with escalation details, Amount Threshold Decision with auto-approval branch, and MBA with Approve/Reject vote), tied to specific process flows. The LLM answer incorrectly treats linear/sequential steps (e.g., Quick KYC Verification, CIA, NFC) as "decision points," inflating the list to 6 irrelevant or misclassified items. It omits key details like the Harmonisation Committee tie-break, the auto-approval for < €15,000, and exact capitalization (**Approve**/**Reject**). This fundamentally misinterprets "decision points" (branching gates) vs. the overall flow, violating the prompt's instruction to use exact activity names without introducing extraneous steps. Strict penalty for core conceptual failure and incompleteness.
  
- **Required Documents Section (Minor Errors, ~1.7/10 weight)**: The list matches the ground truth's 6 items in content and order, with no additions or omissions. However, small phrasing discrepancies deduct points: "≤3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "CIS template" vs. "CIS" (unnecessary "template" addition); missing the ground truth's parenthetical note on exclusions (though not strictly required, it contextualizes completeness). Strict policy applied: even trivial wording variances incur significant loss, but the section is otherwise accurate.

Overall score reflects utmost strictness: the decision points flaws dominate as a core prompt requirement, dragging the total down despite solid documents. Total differences indicate poor fidelity to ground truth structure and precision.
