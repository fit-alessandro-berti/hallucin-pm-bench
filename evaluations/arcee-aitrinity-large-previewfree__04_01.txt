**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correct overall verdict (Non-compliant due to Rules 2 & 3)**: +2.0 baseline.
- **Rule 1**: Contradictory ("violated" then "satisfied"); unnecessary false start despite correct conclusion and details. -1.0.
- **Rule 2**: Accurate identification and explanation. +1.0 (full credit).
- **Rule 3**: Contradictory ("satisfied" then "violated"); undercounts intervening activities (lists only 7-8, omits 9; distance phrasing imprecise vs. ground truth's "distance=3"). -1.0.
- **Rule 4**: Correct conclusion (satisfied), but **factual error** in positions ("Intern at 7 after 8 & 9" — chronologically impossible; ignores actual sequence post-CFO #3). -1.5 (significant, as it misrepresents trace).
- **Rule 5**: Accurate. +0.5.
- **Structure/Format**: Numbered but inconsistent/messy (no bold status like ground truth; contradictions confuse); conclusion clear but redundant. -0.5.
- **Fidelity to ground truth**: Core violations match, but phrasing, precision, and errors create notable differences; violates "utmost strictness" for small/medium errors. Total deductions lead to 6.0.
