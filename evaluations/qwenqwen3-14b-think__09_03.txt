The LLM answer accurately identifies the impossibility due to missing data rows and timestamps in the event log, concisely explaining why calculations (average cycle time, standard deviation, 95% CI) cannot be performed without quantitative data, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning. Minor deductions for slight brevity: it does not explicitly reference the specific activity ("Approve Invoice") or columns (start_time/complete_time), nor suggest the need for additional data, making it marginally less precise per the task's emphasis on exactness.
