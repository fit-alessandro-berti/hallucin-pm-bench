**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order, matching the ground truth's core content without errors, omissions, or extras about other processes. Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary introductory sentence (-0.3); (2) different notation ({curly braces, comma-separated} vs. backticked names with ‖ symbol; "parallel split" vs. "parallel block") (-0.4); (3) added explanatory phrases after each set (-0.2); (4) missing explicit "No other tasks..." confirmation (-0.1). Under utmost strictness, these formatting/phrasing differences warrant a high but imperfect score.
