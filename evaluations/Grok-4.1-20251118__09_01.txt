The LLM answer is an excellent match to the ground truth, correctly stating that the value cannot be derived/computed due to the absence of timestamps and durations, with a clear, data-supported explanation that avoids fabrication. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed"; explicit note on benchmarks, which aligns with the context) do not detract from the core accuracy and fidelity under strict evaluation.
