The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, with perfect factual alignment on all core content for Q1â€“Q3, no hallucinations, missing elements, or fabrications. However, under utmost strictness: Q1 includes unnecessary enumeration of cases (ground truth specifies only the number "3"); Q2 adds an extraneous prefix ("C002 sequence") not present in the ground truth; Q3 adds a descriptive header not matching the ground truth's minimal bulleted list format. These minor extras deviate from the exact ground truth structure, warranting a small but notable deduction despite semantic correctness.
