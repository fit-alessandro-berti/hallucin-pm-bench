Q1. Correct: "3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003)" — matches ground truth.  
Q2. Correct: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" — matches ground truth exactly for sequence and separator.  
Q3. Minor error: Answers are "Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock", in correct alphabetical order, but do not preserve the underscores from the concept:name values in the log (should be "Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"). Since this is a copy-paste task with a strict expectation to match the log's literal strings (including underscores), the omission of underscores in Q3 is a notable deviation from ground truth and counts as a significant detail loss.

No hallucinations or fabricated answers, but the naming error in Q3 warrants a deduction of 1 point for not exactly matching the activity names as presented in the event log and ground truth.

Final Score: 9.0
