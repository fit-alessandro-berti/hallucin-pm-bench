The LLM answer is an exact match in intent, accuracy, and reasoning to the ground truth: both correctly identify that the average cycle time cannot be computed or derived due to the absence of timestamp, duration, or temporal data in the log; both dismiss any reliance on the unrelated historical benchmarks (explicitly or implicitly); and both explain this impossibility clearly without fabricating values. The LLM's structured response (numbered 1 and 2) mirrors the user's query format, adding no errors or deviations, while its explicit mention of the redacted fields and benchmark irrelevance enhances precision without contradicting the ground truth. No differences warrant point deduction under strict evaluation.
