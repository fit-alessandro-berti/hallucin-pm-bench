**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment against ground truth):
- **Vocabulary (perfect match, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Activities list identical.
- **Structure (+0.5 partial)**: Correct rows/columns; no extras introduced. Headers include unwarranted abbreviations "(AM)" etc. (GT uses plain full names). No bolding on key cells/phrases as in GT (e.g., **KYC Review**, **R / A**).
- **RACI Allocations (major errors, -5.0+ penalty)**: 
  | Activity | Key Differences (LLM vs GT) |
  |----------|-----------------------------|
  | Receive Application | AM: R vs **R / A** (missing explicit A) |
  | KYC Review | AM: C vs A; FC: I vs C (2 diffs) |
  | Order Vetting | CO: I vs C; AM: R vs **R / A** (2 diffs) |
  | Payment Clearance | AM: C vs A; CO: I vs C (2 diffs) |
  | Record Update | AM: I vs C; FC: I vs C (2 diffs) |
  | Notify Customer | AM: R vs **R / A** (missing explicit A) |
  
  Total: **10/24 cells differ** (~42% error rate). Core Rs match narrative (one per row), but Consulted/Informed/A misallocated in 4/6 rows. No explicit "R / A" or standalone A as in GT; LLM's "implied A" legend is inaccurate workaround.
- **Unwarranted Content (-1.5 penalty)**: Intro sentence ("Certainly. Below is..."), legend (unneeded, mismatches GT's implicit style), closing offer ("Let me know..."). GT is pure table.
- **Overall**: ~60% similarity (terms/structure) but critical RACI/notation/extras fail "utmost strictness." Small errors (e.g., missing bold/A explicitness) compounded by multiples = sharp deduction. Not a faithful replica.
