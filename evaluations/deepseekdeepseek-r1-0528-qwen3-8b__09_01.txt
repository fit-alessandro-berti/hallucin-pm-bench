9.0

The LLM answer is essentially correct: it clearly states that the requested value cannot be derived, matching the key determination in the ground truth. It also provides a concise explanation that the calculation requires timestamps or elapsed time, which are not included in the provided data.

However, the ground truth answer is slightly more thorough: it explicitly states that not only are timestamps and durations missing, but also any ordering information, and clarifies that any numeric answer would be fabricated. The LLM answer does not explicitly mention the absence of ordering information or warn against fabrication of a value. This is a small but meaningful difference in completeness and rigor, so 9.0 is an appropriate score under the strict grading requested.
