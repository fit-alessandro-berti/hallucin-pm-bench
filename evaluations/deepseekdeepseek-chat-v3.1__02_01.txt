8.0

The LLM answer is almost entirely correct, matching the ground truth on Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, including correct values and format. However, in Q5, the LLM incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" among the activities that never appear as the first event of any case, when in fact for case "C-77" it is the first event. This is a significant but single error. For utmost strictness, this one clear factual error should result in a substantial deduction (â‰¥1.5 points off), but since the rest is perfect, it should not fall below 8.0. Thus, the strictly fair score is 8.0.
