7.0

The LLM answer is correct for Q1â€“Q4, matching the ground truth exactly. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an extraneous item in the list. This is a notable factual error in event log analysis, warranting a deduction despite the otherwise accurate response. Under strict evaluation, the imperfect Q5 (one of five questions) reduces the score from a perfect 10.0.
