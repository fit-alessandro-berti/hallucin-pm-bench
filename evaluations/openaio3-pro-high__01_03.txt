6.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision points**
- The LLM answer invents an extra "Applicant-Confirmation gate" as a decision point, claiming the process "stops" if documents are missing—this is not explicitly described as a decision point in the process, where "Request-Applicant-Confirmation" is a waiting step, not a conditional branch or approval gate. This is an over-interpretation and counts as a significant error.
- In the TriVote gate, the answer is correct regarding the two approvals needed, but doesn't explicitly highlight "at least two of the three approvers… record 'Approve'", as in ground truth, but the difference is relatively minor.
- For the risk-based skip, the rule description essentially matches the ground truth.
- The LLM introduces “assigns every application a Low, Medium, or High risk rating based solely on the three scorecards” as a decision point; however, ground truth only treats the branching after the risk check, not the risk check itself, as a decision point. This is not wrong, but it means the LLM essentially lists one extra non-branch step as a "decision point".

**b) Required documents**
- The list of documents is accurate and strictly in the correct order. No hallucinated documents are added.

**Other points**
- The LLM’s answer is clear, structured, and does not hallucinate any process steps or missing document names. However, the extra inclusion of steps as "decision points" inflates the count and can mislead a consumer relying on exact adherence to the process description.

**Scoring rationale**
Major error (overlisting of decision points/conditional branches and mislabeling passive waiting as a "gate") results in a substantial deduction. The rest matches, so it avoids a harsher penalty. Hence: **6.0**.
