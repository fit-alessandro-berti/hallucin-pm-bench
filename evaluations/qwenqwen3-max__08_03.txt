The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible and provides the appropriate shortest firing sequence (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5) to demonstrate T5 firing without T3 having occurred, with accurate step-by-step markings and justification for minimality (length 4, matching the ground truth's acknowledged lower bound). It aligns well with the query's focus on possibility and ordering up to T5's firing. However, it differs from the ground truth by not including the extended sequence (adding T6 → T3) or mentioning the feedback loop's role in re-enabling T3 afterward, which the ground truth emphasizes as part of "why this works" and presents as the "minimal" sequence (length 6). This omission creates a notable structural difference in the provided sequence and explanation, warranting a deduction despite the high fidelity in core reasoning and markings.
