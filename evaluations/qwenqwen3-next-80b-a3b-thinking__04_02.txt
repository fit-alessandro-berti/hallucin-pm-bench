The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are all â‰¤20 words, factually correct, and capture the core violations without errors. Minor differences exist in wording and emphasis (e.g., R2 omits explicit "expedited" and "2 days" phrasing, focusing on sequence; R5 mentions only Ship_Goods vs. GT's inclusion of Pay_Invoice), but these are small omissions that do not alter the accuracy or intent. Format deviates slightly (list vs. table), but complies with the prompt's structure. Under strict evaluation, deduct 1.0 for justification nuances.
