8.0

Rationale:
- R1: Correct evaluation and concise justification.
- R2: Correctly identifies violation and justification substantially matches, mentioning Ship_Goods occurred before new Manager_Approval after Change_Request (the ground truth focuses on the 2-day deadline after the final required approval, whereas the LLM answer’s phrasing is slightly less precise on the timing aspect. Significant, but minor issue).
- R3: Correctly identified as violated, justification matches.
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable, accurate justification).
- R5: Correct verdict and concise. The LLM indicates Ship_Goods occurred before renewed approval but omits mention that Pay_Invoice is included in the violation; the ground truth answer wisely references both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice. This omission is a moderate error, as R5’s violation would apply to both subsequent steps; thus, some loss of points.
- R6: Coverage is correct.
- Overall result: Correctly concludes NON-COMPLIANT.

Strictly, the LLM answer is accurate for verdicts and most justifications, but it tolerates an ambiguity in R2 (more emphasis on sequence than deadline phrasing) and omits the second relevant event in R5. These are small but non-trivial errors, so I deduct two points for strictness as required.
