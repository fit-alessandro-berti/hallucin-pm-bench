The LLM answer is an exact match in correctness, structure, and fidelity to the system instructions and data constraints. It precisely echoes the mandated phrasing ("cannot be derived"), directly addresses both prompt parts (value + explanation), and cites the header verbatim without fabrication or extraneous details. Ground truth differences (e.g., "computed" vs. "derived"; added "ordering info" and "fabricated") are stylistic only, with zero factual divergence or errors.
