The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order, with perfect task names and no extraneous information about other processes, fully adhering to the prompt's instructions. Semantic content matches the ground truth perfectly. Deduction of 0.8 points for stylistic differences: use of set notation `{}` with comma separation instead of `code ticks` + `‖` symbol; absence of bolded descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"); and omission of the closing sentence ("No other tasks..."), which are small but notable format/verbosity mismatches under strict evaluation criteria.
