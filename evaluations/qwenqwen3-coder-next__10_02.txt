**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Structural differences (major deductions: -4.0 points)**: Columns mismatch (LLM: 3 roles; GT: 4 roles including unmandated "Operations Manager"). LLM omits "Operations Manager" entirely, violating exact match. Row count differs (LLM: 8 tasks; GT: 6 tasks). Headers differ ("Activity" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)").
- **Task descriptions (major deductions: -2.0 points)**: Not identical. E.g., LLM "Receive and log customer transfer instruction in system" vs. GT "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM adds "on sender and beneficiary" and "(if flagged)"; extra rows in LLM ("Ensure SWIFT message is sent", "Notify of case completion") absent in GT; GT omits explicit SWIFT/notify/logging.
- **RACI assignments (major deductions: -2.0 points)**: No exact cell matches across rows. E.g.:
  | Task (approx.) | LLM | GT (TA/RL/OM/IT) |
  |----------------|-----|------------------|
  | Receive       | TA R | R/I/A/C         |
  | Screen        | TA R | R/A/I/C         |
  | KYC           | RL R | C/R/A/I         |
  | Approve       | RL R | C/R/A/I         |
  | Release       | TA R | R/I/A/C         |
  | Archive       | IT R | C/I/A/R         |
  Every assignment differs; LLM lacks "A" on most rows (RACI violation), has incomplete "Notify" row (no R).
- **Vocabulary/mandate compliance (minor credit, but strict: no gain)**: Both use mandated terms correctly, but doesn't offset mismatches.
- **Formatting/extras (minor deductions: -0.5 points)**: LLM uses "—" (not in GT), bolding similar but extra blockquote/notes differ from GT's legend/placement.
- **Overall fidelity**: Partial overlap in core tasks/Rs (~30% similarity), but exhaustive differences warrant low score per strict criteria. No perfect/near-perfect match.
