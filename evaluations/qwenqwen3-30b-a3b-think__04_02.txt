6.0

R1: Correct status and acceptable justification.
R2: Incorrect. The LLM says "Compliant" but ground truth is "Violated"â€”Ship_Goods did not wait for new Manager Approval after Change_Request (so 2-day window is measured from the final approval on 07-Mar, not 04-Mar).
R3: Correct status and justification.
R4: Correct.
R5: Partially correct: status "Violated" is right, and justification notes lack of new Manager Approval before Ship_Goods, but misses also that Pay_Invoice occurred before new approval.
R6: Correct.
Conclusion: Matches.

Critical error for R2 (inverse status) and missing part of R5 in justification, so significant points lost. Some terse justifications; lacks full rationale for R2 and R5. Overall: solid structure but strict grading required.
