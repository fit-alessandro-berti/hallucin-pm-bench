4.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **R1**: Correct status and justification (minor phrasing differences ignored). +1.7 points.
- **R2**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) due to failure to recognize the Change_Request triggers a new "last required approval" on 03-07, making Ship_Goods (03-05) non-compliant with the 2-day window. Critical error; -3.3 points deduction from base.
- **R3**: Correct status; justification accurate but lacks exact dates (small error, per strictness). +1.3 points.
- **R4**: Correct status and justification. +1.7 points.
- **R5**: Correct status; justification incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice before new approval) but captures essence (small error). +1.0 point.
- **R6**: Correct status and justification. +1.7 points.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by R2 error. +1.0 point.
- **Format/Length**: Adheres to â‰¤20 words per justification and all-caps conclusion. No deduction.
- **Base/Strictness**: Started at 10.0; major factual error in R2 (misinterpreting "last required approval" post-change) causes heavy penalty, reflecting utmost strictness for compliance auditing accuracy. Total differences: 1 major status error + 1 minor justification gap = low score.
