3.0

The LLM answer diverges substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Format and structure**: The LLM uses a non-standard RACI presentation with R/A/C/I as columns and role names in cells, while the ground truth employs the conventional matrix format (tasks as rows, roles as columns, R/A/C/I letters in cells). This inverts the typical RACI layout and makes direct comparison/comprehension harder.
- **Roles**: The LLM omits "Operations Manager" entirely (a core column in the ground truth, serving as Accountable for all tasks) and sticks only to Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support. This results in incomplete role coverage relative to the ground truth.
- **Tasks**: The LLM expands to 7 tasks (splitting step 5 into "Release the payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent," and combining archiving/notification as a 7th), while the ground truth consolidates into exactly 6 tasks matching the original steps more closely (no separate SWIFT task). Task wording also varies (e.g., LLM's verbose "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"), introducing unnecessary elaboration.
- **RACI assignments**: Assignments differ fundamentally across nearly all tasks, with no alignment on Accountable (LLM often defaults to the Responsible role, ignoring the ground truth's consistent Operations Manager as A), Consulted, and Informed roles. Examples: For "KYC Review," LLM has R&A for Regulatory Liaison only, vs. ground truth's C for Analyst, R for Liaison, A for Manager, I for IT. For approval, LLM informs Analyst (not in ground truth), while ground truth informs IT. Archiving in LLM lacks C for Analyst (present in ground truth). These mismatches fail to replicate the ground truth's distributed responsibilities.
- **Additional content**: The LLM adds an introductory title, "Key" legend (redundant with the table), and explanatory notes that interpret the process (e.g., justifying consultations), which the ground truth avoids, sticking to a clean table, simple legend, and a brief note on vocabulary compliance. This introduces unsubstantiated assumptions.

While the LLM correctly adopts the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") without forbidden terms and covers the original process elements, the cumulative structural, role, task, and assignment discrepancies represent major deviations, not minor errors. Small issues like inconsistent bolding (e.g., only some tasks bolded) further compound the loss. Overall fidelity to the ground truth is low (~30% alignment in core elements).
