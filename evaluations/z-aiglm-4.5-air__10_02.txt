5.0

**Justification:**

**1. Role and Vocabulary Compliance:**  
- The answer properly uses “Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”, and, where applicable, “KYC Review”.
- However, it omits the **Operations Manager** role, which is present and clearly marked Accountable for all steps in the ground truth. This is a significant deviation.

**2. Task Names:**  
- The answer sometimes uses informal or varied task names (e.g., “Receive and log transfer instruction”) vs. the ground truth’s standardized terms (e.g., “Receive Payment Instruction”).
- Critically, KYC Review should appear explicitly as a task, but in the answer it is “Perform KYC Review”, not just “KYC Review” (the mandated phrase). This is a minor but relevant infraction.

**3. RACI Assignment:**  
- The LLM answer marks both Responsible and Accountable to the same party (e.g., Transaction Analyst for logging, Regulatory Liaison for KYC), ignoring required separation of R and A as in the ground truth.  
- The **Consulted** and **Informed** columns sometimes mismatch (for example, ground truth says Regulatory Liaison is Informed for most non-core tasks, but LLM leaves some blank or assigns differently).
- LLM answer invents/duplicates a step (“Archive case file and notify Regulatory Liaison”), which in the ground truth is just “Archive Record”.

**4. SWIFT / IT Support:**  
- LLM answer includes IT Support in new steps (SWIFT message, etc.) but, per enforced vocabulary, only mandated roles/terms should be used. SWIFT message is not described as a step in the ground truth table; IT Support should be “R” only for “Archive Record”.

**5. Structure & Formatting:**  
- Does not include the “Legend” as in the ground truth.
- Markdown table and structure are acceptable, but deviates in presentation by combining explanation and “Notes”.

**6. Overall fidelity:**  
- The omission of Operations Manager is a severe error because it is the “Accountable” party in every ground truth step.
- Several mismatches in RACI mapping (Accountable+Responsible to same person, missing consultation, etc.).
- Some steps are split/merged/invented, making mapping more difficult.

**Conclusion:**  
Significant structural omissions (missing Operations Manager, inconsistent RACI mapping), deviations in wording (task steps not always strictly using mandated terms), and a few minor errors together justify a low-middle score of **5.0**, consistent with “utmost strictness” criteria.
