10.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and adheres strictly to the ground truth. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2 matches precisely (5.56%, with correct calculation evident). Question 3 correctly identifies A1002 as the sole case, aligning with the ideal response. Question 4 provides two valid, clearly stated sampling-related reasons (temporal limitedness/bias and small sample size), which are directly supported by the ground truth examples without hallucination or inference beyond the log. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing in percentage, concise phrasing in the boxed output) are negligible and do not warrant deduction under strict evaluation, as the content derives solely from the 18 log lines.
