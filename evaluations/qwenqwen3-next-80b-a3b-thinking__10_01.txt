### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (partial credit, +1.5/10)**: The LLM correctly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization, and avoids all forbidden variants (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). Activities are mapped accurately from the legacy description. However, minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., bolding only on some activities, unlike ground truth's selective bolding on key entries) slightly detract.
- **RACI Allocations (major failure, -7.5/10)**: This is the core output and shows fundamental inaccuracies. The LLM oversimplifies to only A (one per row) and I, ignoring R (Responsible) and C (Consulted) entirely, which contradicts the process narrative's explicit performers (e.g., CO "performs" KYC Review → should be R for CO; AM "handles/checks/emails" multiple steps → R/A combinations). Specific mismatches:
  - Receive Application: LLM has A for AM, I elsewhere; ground truth has R/A for AM, C for CO.
  - KYC Review: LLM has A for CO, I for AM; ground truth has A for AM, R for CO, C for FC.
  - Order Vetting: LLM has A for AM, I elsewhere; ground truth has R/A for AM, C for CO.
  - Payment Clearance: LLM has A for FC, I elsewhere; ground truth has A for AM, R for FC, C for CO.
  - Record Update: LLM has A for IT, I elsewhere; ground truth has R for IT, C for AM/FC, I for CO.
  - Notify Customer: Matches on A for AM, I elsewhere, but still incomplete without R nuance.
  The LLM's note claiming "no C or R required" is a clear misinterpretation, violating the narrative's single-responsible-per-activity rule and AM's overarching accountability.
- **Format and Structure (minor credit, +1.0/10)**: Table structure is correct (activities as rows, roles as columns), with logical ordering. Abbreviations (e.g., AM) and a title are not in ground truth but don't add unwarranted tasks/roles/columns. However, no bolding on key RACI entries (e.g., **R / A**) and added explanatory key/notes introduce slight extraneous content not in ground truth.
- **Overall Strictness**: Per rubric, RACI must "reflect the narrative" with exactly one Responsible per activity and appropriate AM accountability—LLM fails this entirely, warranting severe deduction. No self-awareness issues, but unwarranted simplification and extras compound errors. Total reflects ~25% alignment (terms/format only).
