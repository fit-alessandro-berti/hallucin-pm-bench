7.0

**Evaluation:**

**Positive aspects:**
- All three required synonyms are used **exactly** and forbidden terms do not appear (full marks here).
- No unwarranted tasks, roles, or columns were introduced.
- The row order and activity naming matches the ground truth, including correct capitalisation and spelling.

**Issues (point deductions):**
- **Incorrect RACI assignments:** The matrix provided by the LLM:
    - Uses only "A" (Accountable) and "I" (Informed). It does not assign "R" (Responsible) or "C" (Consulted) at all.
    - Many cells that should be “R” or “C” are instead “A” or “I”, creating significant deviation from the ground truth.
    - It claims “all roles are explicitly defined with single accountability and informed status” in a way not supported by the scenario.
        - *Example*: For "KYC Review", the ground truth says Compliance Officer is R, Account Manager is A, Finance Clerk is C, IT is I. In the LLM answer: CO is A, AM/FC/IT are I – this is incomplete and inaccurate.
    - For “Notify Customer”, ground truth shows AM as “R/A,” others as "I". LLM answer assigns only "A" for AM, "I" for all others (no "R").

- **Key omissions:** The LLM omits "R" and "C" roles entirely despite the ground truth indicating them multiple times. This is a major process-mapping flaw.

**Summary:**  
- Terminology adherence is perfect (no deduction).
- Major loss of points for omitting entire RACI roles and providing a less granular, incomplete RACI view.
- Therefore, a strict but fair score is **7.0** – all terminology correct, structure and allocations notably deficient.
