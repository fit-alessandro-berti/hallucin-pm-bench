3.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria)
- **Vocabulary (mandated terms)**: Perfect match (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance used exactly; no forbidden terms). +2.0 points.
- **Structure & Content**:
  - Correct activities listed (no extras). +1.0.
  - Headers include unwarranted abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) not in ground truth. -0.5.
  - Unwarranted legend added. -0.5.
  - No bolding of mandated activity names (**KYC Review**, etc.). -0.5.
- **RACI Allocations**: Major failures (18/24 cells differ; must reflect narrative/ground truth exactly).
  - Primaries partially approximate (e.g., AM R/A for Receive/Order/Notify; CO/IT/FC Rs), but incorrect combos (R/A vs R or R/A separate/spaced), misplaced As/Cs. -2.0.
  - Secondaries entirely wrong: Empties (–) used 14x where ground truth has C/I; e.g., Receive CO I vs C, FC/IT – vs I. -2.0.
  - No activity perfectly matches row (e.g., KYC: AM C vs A, CO R/A vs R, FC/IT blanks vs C/I).
- **Formatting**: **R/A** combined vs **R / A** or separate; inconsistent bolding; dashes vs full fills. -1.0.
- **Overall**: ~75% structural/term match, but RACI/core content ~20% accurate. Strict deduction for all diffs yields 3.2 (low due to pervasive errors).
