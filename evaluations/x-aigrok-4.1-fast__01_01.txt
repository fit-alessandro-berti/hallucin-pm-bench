### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major shortfall, ~30% match)**: LLM identifies only 1 explicit decision (high-value branch after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**), accurately summarizing its logic and *AuditTrail* requirement. However, it completely misses the 2 additional decision points in the ground truth:
  1. Eligibility check in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** (eligible → continue; not → reject).
  2. Final approval at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** / **Senior_Auditor_Review** (approved → payment; rejected → end).
  - This omits implicit but process-critical branches inferred from step names ("Validate_Eligibility", "PreApprove", "succeeded" constraint), violating "every decision point". Significant deduction for incompleteness.
- **Required Documents (near-perfect, ~95% match)**: Lists all 7 exact documents from the process description, correctly noting *AuditTrail* conditionality. Minor format difference (bullets vs. numbered list) and lacks ground truth's catalogue note/parenthetical, but no introductions or errors. Small deduction.
- **Overall Structure/Compliance**: Clean format, no unauthorized activities/artefacts introduced (good). But lacks table, rejection outcomes, and comprehensiveness of ground truth. Strict penalty for partial coverage of core "every decision point" requirement. Total score reflects ~65% content fidelity, heavily weighted down for omissions.
