The LLM answer correctly identifies that the data lacks timestamps and durations, making the calculation impossible, and states this clearly per the system instructions. It addresses both the query parts (value and explanation) without fabricating data. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences from the ground truth (e.g., no explicit mention of "ordering information" or "fabricated" numeric risk, and inclusion of an unnecessary apology), but the core reasoning and conclusion align closely.
