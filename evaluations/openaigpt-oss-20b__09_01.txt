The LLM answer is correct and matches the ground truth in every substantive way:

- It asserts that the requested average cycle time cannot be derived with the data given, due to the absence of timestamp or duration information.
- The explanation directly references the lack of elapsed-time data for the "Review Contract" activity.
- No unsupported number is fabricated.
- The style is clear and unambiguousâ€”faithfully reflecting the ground truth rationale.
