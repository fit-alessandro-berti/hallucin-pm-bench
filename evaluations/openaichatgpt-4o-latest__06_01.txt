8.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth and captures the correct task pairs that can be executed in parallel. The actual task pairs ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines") are both listed, in correct alphabetical order both within the pair and in the overall list. The correct formatting (one pair per line, the '—' as separator) is mostly followed.

However, there are two minor but clear formatting differences:

1. The alignment/spacing: In the ground truth "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines" there are more spaces before the '—', likely to achieve strict column alignment for visual neatness, whereas the LLM answer uses only one space on either side: "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines". While not necessarily a misunderstanding of the process, per your strict grading request, this is a small but relevant difference.
2. Code formatting: The ground truth is wrapped in a code block (```) but the LLM answer is not. This is a presentational/cosmetic detail but again, per your requirement for strictness, it should cost some points.

**Conclusion:**  
- No content/logic errors: 0 points off
- List and order correct: 0 points off
- Formatting (alignment): minus 0.75
- Formatting (code block): minus 0.75

Final score: **8.5**  
(Reflects that while the process understanding is perfect, the answer is not formatted exactly as specified.)
