The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, identifying the two correct parallel pairs with proper alphabetical ordering within and across pairs. The formatting adheres to the specified "Task_X  â€”  Task_Y" structure (with consistent spacing around the em dash), and any minor visual alignment differences in the ground truth presentation (e.g., extra spaces for columnar alignment) do not constitute an error, as they are not required by the prompt.
