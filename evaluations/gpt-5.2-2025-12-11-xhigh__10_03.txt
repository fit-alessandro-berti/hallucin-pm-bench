**2.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect match, +2.5 points)**: All four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") used exactly; no leaks or synonyms. No deductions here.
- **Table structure (+0.5 partial)**: Markdown table with correct role headers. Uses "R/A" (semantically equivalent to ground truth "R, A" or "**R, A**"), "—" (minor glyph diff from "–", but functional). No bolding (ground truth has it on activities/cells), but prompt doesn't mandate.
- **Activities (major failures, -5.0)**: 
  - Core 4 match names exactly.
  - "Compliance Officer approval" ≈ "Compliance Officer Approval" (case/spacing minor, but strict: -0.2).
  - Adds 3 extras ("schedule the payment", "releases the funds", "notifies the originating analyst") not in ground truth; renames/splits "Release Funds" (-2.0). Prompt forbids adding/renaming/merging. Ground truth has exactly 6; LLM has 8 (-2.8 total deduction).
- **RACI assignments (pervasive errors, -4.5)**: ~80% of cells mismatch (e.g., Intake Vetting: Comp Analyst I vs C, Treasury — vs I; KYC/AML: Front C vs –, Officer — vs C, Treasury — vs I; Risk Scoring: Front — vs C, Comp R/A vs R, Officer I vs A; etc.). Extras have no ground truth equivalents. Even partial matches (e.g., some R/A) outweighed by systemic inaccuracies in roles/consults/informs.
- **Overall fidelity**: Captures process intent loosely but deviates heavily from ground truth interpretation (e.g., no separation of KYC/AML involvements, wrong escalations, invented rows). Strict policy demands near-exact match; small errors (glyphs, case) compound with large ones (content/structure).

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 2.5 for cumulative failures.
