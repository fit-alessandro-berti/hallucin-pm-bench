The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), the removed task (Reject Loan), and the core gateway-type change (exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision). However, it deducts points for: (1) incorrectly including a cosmetic name change ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check") under gateway-type changes, violating the explicit instruction to ignore renamings; (2) minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., bullet vs. numbered lists, ID-first vs. name-first presentation, lack of bolding/backticks, no version references like "in v1 to v2", no explanatory abbreviations like "(XOR)/(OR)", and absence of the affirming note on no other changes); (3) less precise terminology for gateway types without BPMN shorthand. These errors, even if small, warrant a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria, preventing a perfect score.
