The LLM answer is fully accurate, directly addresses each question in concise bullet points, and matches the ground truth content precisely (distinct cases, preceding activity, and unique activity). Minor phrasing additions (e.g., "distinct", rephrasing the question in A2, explanatory clause in A3) do not introduce errors or deviate from the core facts, aligning with the prompt's intent for brevity.
