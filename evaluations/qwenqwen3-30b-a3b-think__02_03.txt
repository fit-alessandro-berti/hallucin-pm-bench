9.5

- The LLM answer is correct in substance for all three questions:
    - **A1:** Identifies the three correct distinct cases.
    - **A2:** Correctly gives "Pack_Items" as the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" for C456.
    - **A3:** Correctly identifies "Cancel_Order" as the activity occurring exactly once.

- The only very minor discrepancy is that the LLM answer wrote the answers directly as bulleted statements rather than matching the ground truth's notation (using *A1:*, *A2:*, etc), and enclosed "Ship_Order" in quotes in A2, where the ground truth did not.

- As per strict instructions, even such a minimal deviation (formatting, not content) should lead to a slight point deduction.

**Therefore: 9.5**
