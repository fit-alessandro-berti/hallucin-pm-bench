The LLM answer is an excellent match to the ground truth: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to redacted data, precisely explains the absence of necessary timestamps and event rows for "Approve Invoice," and structures the response to directly address each task element (average cycle time, standard deviation/CI, and rationale) without guessing or extraneous details. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "event data" vs. "concrete times") do not constitute errors, as the core explanation and fidelity to the prompt's constraints are identical in substance and intent.
