9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: The core answer ("3") matches the ground truth exactly. However, the addition of "(C001, C002, C003)" introduces unrequested extra information, which counts as a minor deviation (slight over-elaboration, not fabrication). This deducts 1 point under strict criteria for differences from the concise ground truth.
- **Q2**: Exact match in content and sequence (ignoring markdown escaping like backslashes in ground truth, which is a formatting artifact). No deductions.
- **Q3**: Exact match in content, distinct activities, alphabetical order, and listing (formatting as separate lines vs. `<br>` is negligible). No deductions.

Overall: Near-perfect alignment (one minor extraneous detail), but strictness requires penalizing any non-identical elements.
