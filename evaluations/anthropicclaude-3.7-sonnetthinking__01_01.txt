### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiencies, ~50% of evaluation weight)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points (eligibility validation, amount threshold branching, and final approval/rejection). The LLM answer only covers one (the amount threshold, misnamed as "Refund Value Assessment" and incorrectly placed solely after pre-approval without acknowledging potential failure of pre-approval itself). It omits the critical eligibility check in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** (which determines continuation vs. rejection) and the approval decisions in **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** and **Senior_Auditor_Review** (which gate payment). This is a significant omission of core process logic, leading to substantial point loss under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents (Moderate Deficiencies, ~40% of evaluation weight)**: The ground truth lists seven distinct documents in a clean, exhaustive catalogue. The LLM lists all but combines **FlightManifest** and **WeatherReport** into one item (reducing to six), violating the need for a complete, separate enumeration. It also adds extraneous usage descriptions (e.g., "Submitted by passenger during...") not requested in the prompt or present in the ground truth, introducing unnecessary elaboration. The note on the legacy activity is appropriately included and matches the ground truth, providing minor credit.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor Issues, ~10% of evaluation weight)**: The LLM introduces a titled header and bullet-point formatting not in the ground truth, which is neutral but slightly deviates. No unauthorized activities or artifacts are added, adhering to the prompt's constraint. However, the response is incomplete and imprecise, warranting a low score despite partial accuracy on the high-value branch and document recall. Strict evaluation penalizes these gaps heavily, as even implied decisions from the process description must be fully summarized.
