6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM answer identifies one main decision point: the "Refund Value Assessment" (high-value branch), but omits two critical decision points:
    - The initial *eligibility check* during Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility, which determines if the claim proceeds at all.
    - The *final payment approval* (i.e., whether the claim is approved or rejected after Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review), before Process_Refund_Payment.
- The ground truth clearly lists three decision points. The LLM answer omits two of them and does not specify the possible outcomes/actions (eligible/not eligible; approved/rejected), which is a substantial gap.

**Required Documents:**
- The LLM lists all required documents and matches the ground truth in content and naming.
- The conditional nature of **AuditTrail** is noted ("Required for high-value claims"), which aligns with the annotation in the ground truth.
- No extra documents or activities are introduced, which matches the prompt's constraint.

**Strictness:**
- Fails to enumerate all critical decision points and branching logic (2 out of 3 missed). This constitutes a major deviation, especially as the prompt explicitly requests a summary of "every decision point."
- Required documents are correctly listed, but the error in the decision points is significant and justifies a substantial penalty.

**Conclusion:**
- Given the strong performance on required documents but major omissions and lack of detail on decision points, a strict score would be **6.0**. This reflects a large penalty for missing most required decision content, despite otherwise correct and concise documentation handling.
