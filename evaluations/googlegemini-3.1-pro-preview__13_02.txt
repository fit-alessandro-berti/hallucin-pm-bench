**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1). Question 2a/b match precisely (2.08%, 8.33%, with correct calculations and rounding to two decimals). Question 3 is ≤100 words (89 words), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue ("only once", "single instance"), notes variance/instability ("lacks statistical significance", "isolated event", "overfit...or ignore...class imbalance"), and cautions against over-generalization ("generalize from this single instance", "misrepresents the true..."). It stays within supplied data, uses process-mining relevant examples (performance metrics, predictive ML), and aligns with ground truth criteria without invention or error.
