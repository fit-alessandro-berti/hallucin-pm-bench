**9.0**

The LLM answer identifies exactly the correct two pairs (**Create_Documentation — Quality_Check** and **Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines**), in correct alphabetical order both within pairs and in the list order, with no extraneous pairs or reference to Process A. This matches the ground truth content and rationale perfectly.

However, under utmost strictness for **any differences**, even small whitespace/formatting issues deduct points significantly:
- Second line has incorrect spacing before "—": LLM uses 2 spaces ("Procure_Materials  —"), ground truth uses ~4-5 spaces for vertical alignment ("Procure_Materials     —").
- First line in LLM has extraneous trailing spaces after "Quality_Check  " (2 spaces visible), absent in ground truth.

These are minor whitespace discrepancies but result in non-identical strings, warranting a 1.0 point deduction from perfection (no other errors).
