3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This evaluation is strictly based on fidelity to the ground truth answer, with deductions for every deviation in activities, RACI assignments, formatting, and adherence to the prompt's constraints (e.g., no adding, merging, or renaming activities; covering *every* activity and role from the narrative using only authorized vocabulary). The LLM answer shows partial alignment on the core four authorized activities but fails critically in structure, completeness, and accuracy, warranting a low score.

#### Key Deviations (Strict Point Loss Breakdown):
- **Activities (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: 
  - Prompt requires covering *every* activity without renaming, merging, or adding. Ground truth identifies six distinct activities derived from the narrative (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring, Compliance Officer Approval, Release Funds). LLM only partially covers the first four authorized ones correctly but *adds unauthorized activities* like "(Escalation)", "(Non-escalation)", and "Payment Release" (violating "do not add activities"). It merges escalation/non-escalation logic into parenthetical sub-activities instead of treating "Compliance Officer Approval" as a separate activity (as in ground truth). It omits explicit "Release Funds" and fails to derive "Compliance Officer Approval" properly from the escalation path. This is a fundamental structural mismatch, not merely a small error.
  
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Widespread inaccuracies across roles:
    - **Intake Vetting**: LLM assigns only "R" to Front-Office Analyst (blanks others); ground truth has "R, A" for Front-Office, "C" for Compliance Analyst, "I" for Treasury Ops, and "–" for Compliance Officer. Missing Consulted/Informed roles and no "A" accountability.
    - **KYC Review**: LLM has "R, A" for Compliance Analyst (correct) but blanks others; ground truth adds "C" for Compliance Officer and "I" for Treasury Ops (and "–" for Front-Office).
    - **AML Screening**: LLM has only "R" for Compliance Analyst (blanks others); ground truth has "R, A" for Analyst, plus "C" for Officer, "I" for Treasury, "–" for Front-Office. Incorrect accountability and missing cross-role involvements.
    - **Risk Scoring**: LLM has "R" for Analyst and "C" for Officer (blanks others); ground truth has "R" for Analyst, "C" for Front-Office, "A" for Officer, "I" for Treasury. Wrong assignments (e.g., Officer is Accountable, not Consulted; missing Front-Office/Treasury).
    - Added/incomplete activities exacerbate this: LLM's "(Escalation)" and "(Non-escalation)" have incorrect/missing roles (e.g., no "I" for Front-Office in approval/release; Treasury Ops lacks "C" in Release Funds per ground truth).
  - Overall, LLM under-assigns Consulted/Informed roles (e.g., no broad "I" or "C" across the process, like Treasury Ops being Informed on early steps or Compliance Analyst Consulted on release). It ignores the narrative's "notifies the originating analyst" (Front-Office as Informed).

- **Formatting and Presentation (Minor but Strict Deduction: -0.5 points)**:
  - LLM uses blanks for no involvement instead of "–" (as in ground truth). It adds a "Key" section and "Note" (unnecessary and not in ground truth/prompt). Parentheticals for activities violate the clean Markdown table requirement. Boldening is inconsistent (e.g., ground truth bolds activity names and key R/A cells).

- **Vocabulary and Policy Adherence (No Deduction Here, but Contextual)**:
  - Correctly uses only the four authorized terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without leaks/synonyms. However, added activities introduce non-authorized phrasings (e.g., "Payment Release" instead of "Release Funds"), indirectly violating the strict policy.

- **Overall Completeness and Strictness (Holistic Deduction: -0.5 points)**:
  - Fails to cover *every* role/activity from the narrative (e.g., no explicit handling of Front-Office as Informed on later steps; escalation path not fully mapped). Even small errors (e.g., missing "A" in AML Screening) compound to show incomplete process governance understanding.

#### Why Not Lower/Higher?
- Base credit (~3.0) for correctly identifying and using the four core authorized activities with partially accurate "R" assignments for primary roles (e.g., Front-Office for Intake, Analyst for KYC/AML/Risk).
- Not 1.0 because it doesn't hallucinate wildly or violate vocabulary outright, but the additions/merges/omissions make it ~70% divergent—strictly penalized as a failed attempt at the full RACI scope.
- Not higher (e.g., 5.0+) due to utmost strictness: The prompt's "do NOT output synonyms... even in explanations" extends to not fabricating activity names; deviations in RACI logic (e.g., who is Accountable for Risk Scoring) are not "small" in a governance context.
