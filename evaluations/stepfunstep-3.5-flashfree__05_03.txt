6.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major deductions (-2.0 total)**: Missing `cancelActivity="true"` (fundamental: non-interrupting timer allows parallel execution without halting the breaching task, failing true SLA enforcement); missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (XML schema compliance issue, as seen in original model's conditionExpressions).
- **Moderate deductions (-1.0 total)**: No `name` attribute on boundary event; lacks explanatory comments (e.g., ❶ ❷); justification omits "interrupting" (critical behavioral descriptor) and precise phrasing ("pre-existing" vs. "unused"); no code block formatting.
- **Minor positives**: Correct attachment to `Activity_CreateAccount`, `PT48H` duration, flow to existing `Activity_AMReview`, one-sentence format, no new activities added.
- **No credit for intent**: Timer timing approximates SLA (starts at task activation, post-VerifyID), but identical to ground truth—no deduction. Overall ~65% match due to functional/XML validity gaps.
