4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Differences, Significant Deduction)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 precise decision points with explicit branching logic/outcomes in a structured table (eligibility check, amount threshold post-pre-approval, and combined final approval across pre-approve/senior review). The LLM answer incorrectly expands to 4 points, misplaces the timing of the amount threshold (GT specifies "after Finance_Controller_PreApprove"; LLM vaguely places it after pre-approval without precision), assumes unstated outcomes like explicit "approve/reject" in Senior_Auditor_Review (GT combines this implicitly in point 3 without assuming rejection for senior review alone), and introduces unsubstantiated details like "system automatically determines" (process doesn't specify the mechanism). No table structure, and descriptions lack GT's exact branching/outcome phrasing (e.g., GT details "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → claim rejected/returned"). This over-interpretation and inaccuracy reflects poor fidelity to the process description, warranting a severe penalty under strict criteria.

- **Required Documents (Moderate Differences, Notable Deduction)**: GT lists 7 documents exhaustively, including the output RefundConfirmationPDF as part of the "catalogue" despite it being generated (implying all mentioned artefacts count as "required" in the process context). LLM omits this entirely, reasoning it as "not required as input" (a logical but non-matching interpretation, as GT includes it without qualification beyond the note on AuditTrail). The other 6 match, with similar conditional note on AuditTrail, but the omission is a clear error. No introduction of extras, which is positive, but incompleteness lowers the score.

- **Overall Strictness**: The LLM introduces minor assumptions and formatting (conversational summary vs. GT's clean table/list), violates "do not introduce any activities or artefacts" by implying unstated decisions/outcomes, and deviates significantly from GT's concise, precise structure. Small errors (e.g., phrasing, omissions) compound to a low score; perfect alignment would be 10.0, but cumulative mismatches justify ~40% fidelity.
