9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core correctness (perfect match, no factual errors):** +10.0 base. Identifies exactly the two correct sets of concurrent tasks from Process B only (Quality_Check ‖ Update_Inventory; Generate_Replenishment_Report ‖ Notify_Procurement), in correct sequential order (#1 then #2), with no mention of A/C or extraneous tasks. Aligns perfectly with prompt requirements.
- **Structure and numbering:** Matches "number the sets in the order they appear" precisely (+0 deduction).
- **Minor deductions for differences from ground truth (strict penalty applied):**
  - Verbose extras: Intro ("Sure, I can help..."), repeated list under "So, the list...", and explanatory sentences ("These tasks are independent..."; final "These tasks can be executed..."). Ground truth is concise; these add ~40% unrequested content. (-0.4)
  - Formatting/phrasing variances: Uses **bold** + "and" instead of `backticks` + ‖; "parallel construct (Parallel Split #1)" vs. "first parallel block" (semantically identical but not verbatim); no explicit "No other tasks..." closer (implied but absent). (-0.2)
  - No major structural mismatch, but not identical minimalism. Total deduction: -0.8.

Net: 10.0 - 0.8 = 9.2. Semantically equivalent and fully responsive, but strict fidelity to ground truth's brevity/format prevents 10.0.
