**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Statuses**: 5/6 correct (R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 match). R2 wrong (**Compliant** vs. **Violated**; failed to recognize new Manager_Approval on 03-07 as "last required approval" post-Change_Request, making Ship_Goods on 03-05 non-compliant with "within 2 days *after*").
- **Justifications**: All ≤20 words and formatted correctly. R1, R3, R4, R6 closely aligned. R2 entirely wrong. R5 correct but incomplete (misses Pay_Invoice; GT specifies Ship_Goods *and* Pay_Invoice).
- **Overall**: Matches (**NON-COMPLIANT**).
- **Strictness adjustment**: Major R2 error (inter-rule logic failure) deducts heavily (-2.0); minor R5 gap (-0.5); format/exactness minor deviations (-0.5). Base 10.0 → 7.0.
