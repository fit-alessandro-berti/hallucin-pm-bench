The LLM answer is substantively correct and aligns closely with the ground truth: both correctly answer "No," identify the exact counterexamples (C002 with Pack_Items intervening; C004 with Check_Fraud intervening), cite relevant CaseIDs and sequences (including timestamps), and note that the rule holds for C001/C003 but fails "always" due to violations. Minor deductions for:
- Lack of exhaustive case-by-case enumeration in a table (ground truth explicitly tabulates *all* cases with columns for sequence, successor status, and notes, fulfilling "meticulous" analyst role more precisely).
- Slightly less structured presentation (bullets vs. comprehensive table), omitting explicit "two out of four" quantification.
- Phrasing differences ("interleaved" vs. "intervenes before"; "process-wide rule" vs. "stated rule inaccurate"), though semantically equivalent.

No factual errors, but strict adherence to ground truth format/completeness warrants ~0.8-point loss.
