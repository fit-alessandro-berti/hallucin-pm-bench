The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in all assessments (correct "No", accurate per-rule justifications matching violations/satisfactions and reasonings verbatim in substance). Minor stylistic differences (bullets vs. table; phrasing like "happens before" vs. "precedes"; "exactly once" vs. "appears once") are superficial and do not alter correctness, completeness, or rule referencing. No errors or omissions under strict evaluation.
