**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate, covers all three cases with accurate overall ordering (Update_Inventory before Authorize_Refund where present, absent in 1002), and concludes properly that Authorize_Refund never immediately precedes Update_Inventory. Structure is concise, cites case IDs and activities as required, and matches the ground truth's core logic and evidence.

**Strict deductions (-3.0 total):**
- Factual error in Case 1001 justification: Claims "(and there is an intervening activity)" between Update_Inventory and Authorize_Refund, but they are consecutive (no intervention), misstating the data despite correct order note. This violates "base every statement strictly on the data" and introduces a difference from ground truth's precise description.
- Omits line number citations (e.g., ground truth's "lines 3-4", "11 & 14"), reducing evidentiary precision despite "citing relevant... activities."
- Minor formatting/style differences (e.g., no "Short verdict" header, slightly less emphasis on "reversed" ordering or "always" disproof phrasing).

High alignment overall, but strict policy demands significant penalty for data misstatement and precision gaps.
