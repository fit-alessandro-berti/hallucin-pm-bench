4.0

**Evaluation:**

**Major Errors:**
- **Missing Role:** The LLM Answer omits the "Operations Manager" role present in the Ground Truth. This results in missing "Accountable" (A) assignments in all steps (which are assigned to "Operations Manager" in ground truth).
- **Mandated Wording:** The LLM sometimes uses informal wording for tasks (e.g. “Receive the customer’s transfer instruction and log it in the system” vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"), while ground truth uses rigorously cleaned-up, concise process-task names.
- **Redundant Task:** LLM introduces a task "Notify the Regulatory Liaison", which doesn’t exist in the process description or ground truth; this adds unnecessary (and misleading) information.
- **Incorrect RACI Assignments:** Several assignments differ from ground truth. For instance, it often conflates "Responsible" and "Accountable" on the same person, whereas ground truth separates these.
- **Improper Role Assignment:** For KYC Review and Approval steps, the roles of Responsible and Accountable are not allocated according to ground truth (e.g., Regulatory Liaison is always accountable but not always marked so here).

**Smaller Issues:**
- "KYC Review" and other mandated terms are not always rendered precisely as headings/descriptors for activity names (though the roles themselves are mostly correct).
- Some columns (especially IT Support) are left empty in tasks where, per ground truth, consultation or information is needed.
- The LLM table fails to include all step-by-step process activities found in the ground truth (e.g. “Archive Record” is not precisely worded).

**Summary:**  
Given the strict grading criteria and emphasis on exact vocabulary, structure, and role mapping:  
- Severe point deduction for missing a major role (Operations Manager) and resulting omission of "Accountable" designations.
- Significant penalty for adding an unwarranted extra step and not mapping all activities to the mandated vocabulary.
- More moderate point deduction for informal task labeling and occasionally missing RACI markings.

**Hence: 4.0 — below average, due to both structural and terminological errors.**
