1.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This evaluation is strictly based on differences from the ground truth answer, with even minor deviations penalized heavily as per instructions. The LLM answer shows partial adherence to the prompt's vocabulary mandate (e.g., correctly using "KYC Review," "Transaction Analyst," and "Regulatory Liaison") but fails in structure, completeness, accuracy, and fidelity to the source text mapping. Key deductions:

- **Structure and Columns (major penalty: -4.0)**: Missing "Operations Manager" column entirely, reducing roles from 4 to 3. This omits a core element of the ground truth's RACI framework, which introduces an accountable oversight role not explicitly mandated but required for matching the reference. Header lacks "(mandated wording)" phrasing and legend.
  
- **Task Breakdown and Wording (major penalty: -2.5)**: 8 tasks vs. ground truth's 6, with unnecessary splits (e.g., separate "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent," "Archive the case file," and "Notify the Regulatory Liaison" instead of consolidating into "Release Payment" and "Archive Record"). Wordings deviate significantly (e.g., verbose "Receive the customerâ€™s transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; adds unmandated "Perform the" before "KYC Review"). Fails strict "mandated wording" for activities, introducing extras not in source or ground truth. No bolding for key R/A entries.

- **RACI Assignments (major penalty: -3.0)**: Near-total mismatch across all tasks. Examples: For "KYC Review," LLM assigns C (Transaction Analyst)/R-A (Regulatory Liaison)/blank (IT Support) vs. ground truth C/R/A/I. For screening, R-A/I/blank vs. R/A/I/C. Uses invalid combined "R/A" notation (non-standard; RACI requires discrete R, A, C, I). Illogical for "Notify" task (e.g., "I" for Regulatory Liaison on their own notification is semantically flawed). Ignores ground truth's distributed accountability (e.g., Operations Manager as A in most tasks).

- **Completeness and Prompt Fidelity (minor but penalized: -1.0)**: Covers source steps but distorts them (e.g., no integration of notification into "Archive Record"; SWIFT sending treated separately without consultation mapping). No legend, violating clear organization mandate. While Markdown is used, it doesn't achieve "clearly organized" RACI per ground truth.

Overall, superficial vocabulary use provides minimal credit, but systemic deviations in roles, tasks, and assignments make this a poor match (80%+ divergence). A score above 2.0 would understate the strictness required.
