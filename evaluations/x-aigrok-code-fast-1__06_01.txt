7.0

The LLM answer lists both correct pairs, and only the correct pairs, so conceptually it has selected the right tasks. However, it loses points for formatting errors relative to the ground truth:

- **Spacing Error**: The pairs are missing the exact formatting requested ("—" with two spaces on each side, and task names aligned to the left margin), which was explicitly specified. In the answer, e.g., "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" has only one space on each side and the tasks are not lined up as per the example in the prompt/ground truth.
- **Order Within Pair**: The order within the pairs is acceptable as both task names are in alphabetical order.
- **Overall List Order**: The list is correctly sorted alphabetically at the pair level.

Because "Output one pair per line, using the format Task_X  —  Task_Y" was an explicit instruction and not followed precisely (see the double spaces and alignment in ground truth), this constitutes a material format error and thus results in a significant deduction, but not a failing score as the substantive content is fully correct.

**Final Score:** 7.0
