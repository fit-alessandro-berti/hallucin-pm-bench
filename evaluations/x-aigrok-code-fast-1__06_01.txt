The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs of parallel tasks from Process B, in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), with appropriate task names. The content is identical to the ground truth. However, the formatting deviates slightly: the ground truth uses extra spaces for visual alignment of the em dashes (e.g., multiple spaces before and after in the second line), while the LLM answer uses a more basic spacing consistent with the prompt's example but without alignment. Under utmost strictness, this minor formatting inconsistency warrants a deduction, though the core response is highly accurate.
