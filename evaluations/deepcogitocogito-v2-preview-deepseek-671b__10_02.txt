4.0

**Justification:**

- **Strict Vocabulary Adherence:**  
  The LLM answer generally follows the enforced vocabulary (“KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”), and never uses the prohibited terms.

- **Role Omission:**  
  The ground truth answer includes an **Operations Manager** as a key role (Accountable for every task). The LLM answer leaves out this role entirely. This is a **significant error**: every RACI must accurately reflect all participants from the process context, especially according to the ground truth.

- **Tasks/Activity Wording:**  
  Some activities are split, combined, or ambiguously worded compared to the ground truth. For example:
    - “Notify relevant parties of completion” is included by the LLM, but this is not specified as an explicit step in the ground truth.
    - "Process payment release" and "Initiate SWIFT transmission" are separated; the ground truth considers "Release Payment" as a single step in which IT Support is consulted.
    - Task labels in the ground truth are more concise and strictly follow the mandated terminology (e.g.: **“KYC Review”** as its own row, not "Perform KYC Review on all parties"). LLM uses variations and extra wording; e.g. “Archive transaction documentation” vs. "Archive Record".

- **Consulted/Informed Mapping:**  
  The mapping of R, A, C, I against roles and activities diverges substantially from the ground truth.
    - The LLM almost never uses 'Consulted'; often, only R and A are present.
    - The “Accountable” role mapping does not match the ground truth (almost always "self-accountable" on RACI, whereas the ground truth always uses Operations Manager as A).
    - “Informed” and “Consulted” are not distributed as in the ground truth matrix.

- **Step Coverage & Structure:**  
  The ground truth comprises 6 tasks, the LLM answer expands to 8. While some splitting may be justifiable, the mapping diverges from the task-by-task requirements and expected groupings.

- **Formatting:**  
  The Markdown table format is clear, though adding unexplained abbreviations (TA, RL, IT) is a minor markdown/clarity deficiency vs. the full role names in headers.

**Conclusion:**  
While the LLM does not commit major vocabulary violations, the extensive differences in included roles, task/step phrasing, mapping of R/A/C/I, and lack of proper consultation/information relationships are significant and would be serious process documentation failures. Minimal small errors accumulate to a large discrepancy. The score reflects a submission that's below an acceptable professional threshold for process RACI documentation.
