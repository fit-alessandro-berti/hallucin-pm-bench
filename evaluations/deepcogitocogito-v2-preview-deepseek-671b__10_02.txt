### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Partial Credit, but Strict Deduction)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst" in the table and activities, aligning with the mandate. However, it introduces minor rephrasings (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on all parties" vs. ground truth's concise "**KYC Review**"; "Review and approve high-risk transactions" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions"), which are small deviations from exact mandated wording. This results in a -1.5 point deduction for not mirroring the ground truth's precision.
  
- **Roles (Major Differences, Heavy Deduction)**: The LLM uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support, omitting the ground truth's "Operations Manager" entirely. This creates structural mismatches across all rows (e.g., no "A" assignments to Operations Manager in LLM, which is central in ground truth for accountability). The prompt mandates using *only* specified terms but does not introduce Operations Manager, yet the evaluation criterion requires closeness to ground truth, so this omission is a critical flaw. -3.0 points.

- **Activities/Tasks (Significant Differences, Heavy Deduction)**: LLM expands to 8 activities with splitting (e.g., separate "Process payment release" and "Initiate SWIFT transmission") and adds an unsubstantiated "Notify relevant parties" activity not explicitly in ground truth or source. Ground truth has exactly 6 concise tasks (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. LLM's "Receive and log customer transfer instructions"; no equivalent for LLM's extra notify row). This adds extraneous content and omits ground truth's exact mappings, violating "covers every task...without omissions." -2.5 points.

- **RACI Assignments (Fundamental Mismatches, Severe Deduction)**: Assignments diverge completely, with no row matching ground truth:
  - E.g., "Receive": LLM (TA R/A only) vs. GT (TA R, Operations Manager A, RL I, IT C).
  - "Screen": LLM (TA R/A) vs. GT (TA R, RL A, Operations Manager I, IT C).
  - "KYC Review": LLM (RL R/A) vs. GT (RL R, Operations Manager A, TA C, IT I).
  - Similar mismatches for approve/release/archive; LLM rarely uses C/I and overloads R/A on performers, while GT distributes accountability and involvement (especially to Operations Manager). No consulted/informed roles in many LLM rows where GT specifies them. -2.0 points.
  
- **Format and Structure (Minor but Strict Deduction)**: LLM includes unnecessary preamble (step-by-step breakdown, explanations), abbreviations (TA/RL/IT), a title, and an extra note/legend that doesn't match ground truth's clean Markdown table with bolding and simple legend. Ground truth is direct and concise; LLM's extras dilute focus on the table. -0.5 points.

Overall, while vocabulary is handled well, the pervasive differences in roles, tasks, assignments, and extraneous content make the LLM answer a loose interpretation rather than a faithful match. Strict evaluation caps it low despite partial accuracies.
