The LLM answer proposes the exact same XML diff change as the ground truth (identical lines and hunk content), fully complying with rules by modifying only one existing `camunda:dueDate` attribute without adding/deleting elements. Minor deductions for: (1) missing closing `@@` in diff hunk (-0.3), (2) lack of numbered output format "1."/"2." (-0.3), (3) rationale wording/format differences (no bolding, hyphenation mismatch, no "3-day SLA" or "without new activities" phrasing, different explanatory focus on "critical path" vs. direct SLA reference; still one valid sentence) (-0.4).
