The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, correctly identifying the lack of timestamps as the reason the cycle time cannot be computed, with only minor wording differences from the ground truth (e.g., "Iâ€™m unable" vs. "It is impossible," and inclusion of "inter-event intervals" which aligns but isn't exact phrasing). Under utmost strictness, this slight variation in tone and specificity deducts a small amount, but the core explanation and structure match closely.
