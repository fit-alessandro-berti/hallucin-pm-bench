The LLM answer is highly accurate: it correctly states that computation is impossible due to the lack of timestamps or interval information, directly addressing the promptâ€™s constraints.

**Minor issues for deduction:**
- The phrase "or inter-event intervals" is nonstandard and may muddy clarity slightly compared to the ground truth's direct mention of "duration information."
- The answer does not mention that only event counts are provided, as the ground truth does.

Otherwise, the logic and directness of the response are excellent. For these minor omissions and wording differences, a 0.5 point deduction is applied.
