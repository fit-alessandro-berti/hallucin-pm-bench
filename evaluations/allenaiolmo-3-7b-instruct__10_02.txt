**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Vocabulary violations (-1.5 points)**: Introduces "Compliance Manager*" repeatedly (forbidden semantic equivalent to "Compliance Officer"; mandate requires *only* "Regulatory Liaison"). Adds "Beneficiary (if required)" and "All relevant stakeholders" (non-mandated, extraneous). Uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") where applicable but undermined by extras.
- **Table structure/format mismatch (-1.8 points)**: Non-standard RACI (columns as R/A/C/I with single roles; ground truth uses roles as columns with letters in cells). Includes unrequested title (# header), footnote (*Note*), rationale section, and closing offer ("Let me know...") – ground truth is pure table + legend + minimal note.
- **Task coverage/accuracy (-1.5 points)**: Expands source's 6 steps into 8 tasks (adds #7 archive, #8 notify as separate; splits #5 release/SWIFT; verbose phrasing e.g., "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"). Omits exact mapping fidelity; ground truth precisely condenses without additions/omissions.
- **Roles and assignments divergence (-1.5 points)**: New unauthorized roles ("Compliance Manager") dominate as "A"; partial overlap (e.g., TA for ops, RL for KYC) but differs from ground truth's "Operations Manager" as consistent "A" and specific R/A/C/I per role-column.
- **Minor extras (-0.5 points)**: Bold/italics inconsistencies, unnecessary expansions (e.g., "on sender and beneficiary"), non-source elements (e.g., "audit trails" in rationale).
- **Partial positives (+0.3 base)**: Markdown table present; covers core steps; uses mandated terms in places.

Total reflects *utmost strictness*: ~70% deviation in content/structure/content fidelity = low-mid score.
