The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides an accurate justification by citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001–C004) with precise activity sequences, highlighting counterexamples in C002 and C004 where intervening activities (Pack_Items and Check_Fraud) violate the "always immediate" claim. This aligns fully with the ground truth in content, structure of reasoning (case-by-case analysis), and conclusion, with no factual errors, omissions, or deviations—only minor stylistic differences in presentation (list vs. table) that do not affect accuracy or completeness.
