The LLM answer is almost perfect:

Strengths:
- Correctly answers "No".
- Provides clear, accurate case-by-case justifications, citing relevant CaseIDs and exact sequences.
- Clearly points out the counterexamples (C002 and C004) and explains why the FACT is false.

Minor issues:
- The justification for C001 and C003 could be more explicit in affirming that those are compliant cases, not just listing the sequences. The ground truth more clearly labels "immediate" vs "not immediate" for each case, while the LLM answer focuses more on the negative examples.
- The LLM's format is less structured (e.g., no table, less formal labeling of intermediary vs immediate).

Overall, the factual content is entirely correct, and the method is sound. Only minor marks are lost due to slightly less comprehensive/structured justification detail compared to ground truth.
