The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides an accurate minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, matching the ground truth sequence. However, it lacks the ground truth's explicit markings (e.g., M₁ = {P1, P2}), the alternative path explanation in Q1, and the confirmatory detail about T5 disabling T3 by consuming the P2 token. These omissions reduce completeness and verification clarity, warranting a deduction despite no factual errors. The response stays under 120 words.
