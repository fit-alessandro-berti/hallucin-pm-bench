The LLM answer accurately identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), with no speculation or extras, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements and the core content of the ground truth. However, it incurs deductions for small but noticeable differences in presentation and phrasing relative to the ground truth: (1) headings use plain â€¢ bullets instead of **bold** formatting (-0.5); (2) list items use - dashes instead of * bullets (-0.3); (3) task listings prioritize id (name) format without backticks or "id = `" phrasing, reversing the ground truth's name-first order (-0.7); (4) gateway change uses a concise arrow notation without explicit "(v1)" and "(v2)" versioning or bolding (-0.5). These formatting and stylistic variances, though minor, reduce exactness under strict evaluation, but the response remains highly faithful overall without substantive errors.
