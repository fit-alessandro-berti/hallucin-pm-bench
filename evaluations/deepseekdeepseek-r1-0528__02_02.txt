9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Exact match on core answer (3 distinct cases). Minor deduction for unrequested enumeration of case IDs (-0.2 points), but no factual error.
- **Q2**: Exact sequence match. Deduction for unrequested addition of timestamps and event details (-0.5 points), as this deviates from the concise ground truth format.
- **Q3**: Exact list of activities (alphabetically ordered, one per line). Significant deduction for extraneous explanatory sections ("Precedence details" and summary), which introduce unrequested content and inflate the response beyond the ground truth (-1.3 points total across questions keeps overall strict but recognizes accuracy).

Core content is factually precise with no hallucinations or missing elements; deductions reflect strict adherence to minimal ground truth format only.
