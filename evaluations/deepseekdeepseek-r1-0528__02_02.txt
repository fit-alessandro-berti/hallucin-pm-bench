9.0

**Evaluation:**

- **Q1:** Correct. "There are 3 distinct cases." (No error.)
- **Q2:** Correct sequence and correct separator, activity names match exactly. Provided timestamps and additional event labeling is extra but does not contradict, so only a minor stylistic deviation (not penalized as hallucination, but adds info not requested).
- **Q3:** The activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock") are correct, order is correct (alphabetical), reworded but does not alter factual content. The explanation with case breakdown is additional but correct, not misleading.

**Deduction:**
The only issue is a slight verbosity/over-explanation in Q2 and Q3; all factual content matches exactly with no extra, missing, or incorrect elements, so penalization must be minimal. As per strict marking, the inclusion of superfluous sequencing information in Q2 is not hallucination, but not purely concise, so deduct 1 point for not being strictly as requested (minor deviation from required answer format).

**Final score: 9.0**
