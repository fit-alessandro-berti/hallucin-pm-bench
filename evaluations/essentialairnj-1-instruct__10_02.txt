**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary Mandate Violation (Catastrophic Failure, -4.0 points)**: Core instruction mandates *strict* use of “Transaction Analyst” (not “Payment Clerk”), “Regulatory Liaison” (not “Compliance Officer”), and “KYC Review” *only*. LLM uses forbidden terms everywhere (e.g., “Payment Clerk” 4x, “Compliance Officer” 3x). “Regulatory Liaison” and “Transaction Analyst” barely appear (1x each, incorrectly). Ground truth uses them perfectly.
- **Task Coverage & Fidelity (-3.0 points)**: Source has 6 clear steps; LLM invents 9 distorted tasks (e.g., TXN1 wrongly adds “Recipient logs”; duplicates archiving in TXN8/TXN9; omits/rephrases inaccurately). Ground truth maps exactly 6 tasks without additions/omissions.
- **RACI Structure & Clarity (-1.5 points)**: Headers malformed (e.g., “R&R _”, asterisks, “TXN#” IDs absent in ground truth). Cells empty/misaligned; assignments nonsensical (e.g., “TXN4” in A column). No clear legend like ground truth. Roles/tasks not aligned to R/A/C/I matrix properly.
- **Markdown & Formatting (-0.5 points)**: Broken table (misaligned pipes, run-on text); unreadable vs. ground truth's clean, professional layout.
- **Overall Fidelity to Ground Truth (0 partial credit)**: No matching tasks, roles (e.g., no “Operations Manager”), or assignments. Intro text claims “correctly structured” but fails entirely.

Total: 1.0 (minimum; zero adherence to specs despite superficial table attempt).
