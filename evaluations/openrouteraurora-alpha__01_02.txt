**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision Points (major deductions: -3.5 points total)**:
  - LLM lists **4 points** vs. GT's **3 points**: Introduces "Harmonisation Committee" as a standalone #2, but GT correctly nests it *within* #1 (Underwriter Alignment Gate) as the escalation branch. This alters the summary structure and misrepresents the flow (significant error).
  - Missing key GT specifics: No "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" in #1; no "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" in #2 (omits flow context).
  - #1 omits "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B scores" (uses generic "the two risk scores").
  - #3 imprecise: "forward to the board" vs. GT's "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" (vague terminology).
  - #4 minor phrasing diff: "*approve* or *reject*" vs. GT's "**Approve** or **Reject**" (lowercase/italics mismatch).
  - Extra header text "(exact activity names)" not in GT.

- **Required Documents (minor deductions: -0.5 points)**:
  - List complete and names match prompt exactly (strong alignment).
  - Phrasing nearly identical, but minor diffs: Bolded elements/en-dashes not in GT; bullet vs. numbered list; no trailing note "(No credit bureau...)" (GT extra, but LLM omission neutral).
  - Small formatting inconsistencies (e.g., non-breaking spaces) count as minor errors under strictness.

- **Overall Structure/Compliance (minor deductions: -0.0)**:
  - Uses exact activity names; no standard terminology introduced. Clear separation. But separator "---" and bolding deviate from GT's markdown.

Total: High fidelity on documents (+4/5), but decision points critically flawed in count, nesting, and precision (-3/5). Strict scoring reflects structural/accuracy gaps.
