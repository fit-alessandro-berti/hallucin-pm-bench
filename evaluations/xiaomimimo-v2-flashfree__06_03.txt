The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two concurrent task sets from Process B in the correct order, with no factual errors, extraneous information about other processes, or omissions of parallel constructs. It adheres closely to the prompt's requirements.  

Minor deductions for stylistic differences from the ground truth:  
- Added introductory sentence (not present in ground truth).  
- Label phrasing ("Set 1 (from Parallel Split #1)") vs. ("Set 1 – first parallel block"), though both accurate.  
- Bullet-point list format vs. inline with `backticks` and ‖ symbol.  
- Lacks the ground truth's closing sentence ("No other tasks..."), though not required by the prompt.  

These are superficial formatting/presentation variances, not content errors, warranting only a small penalty under strict evaluation.
