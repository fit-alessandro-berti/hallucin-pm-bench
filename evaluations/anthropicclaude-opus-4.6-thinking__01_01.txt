**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (favoring higher score)**:
  - Correctly identifies **exactly 3 decision points** (matches GT count).
  - All documents match GT perfectly: same 7 items, same conditional note on *AuditTrail*, no extras introduced.
  - Faithful to process: no undefined activities/artefacts (notes legacy correctly); accurate sequencing (e.g., threshold after PreApprove).
  - High-value branch logic identical (> €1 000 → Auditor).
  - Comprehensive, well-formatted, professional.

- **Errors/Differences (significant deductions per strictness rule)**:
  - **Decision points summaries differ substantially in naming, structure, phrasing, and grouping** (-1.5):
    | Aspect | GT | LLM | Issue |
    |--------|----|-----|-------|
    | #1 | "*Eligibility check* during Triage... *Not eligible* → rejected/returned" | "Eligibility Decision at Triage... or it does not" | Vague/missing explicit rejection; different name. |
    | #2 | "*Amount threshold* after PreApprove (> €1 000 → Auditor; ≤ → skip)" | "Pre-Approval Decision at PreApprove (sign off?)" | Wrong order/grouping; LLM inserts PreApprove as #2 (GT folds into #3); no exact match. |
    | #3 | "*Final payment approval* at PreApprove/Auditor (Approved → payment; Rejected → ends)" | "High-Value Threshold... (Yes → Auditor; No → payment)" | Swapped/misgrouped vs GT #2/#3; misses explicit "Rejected → ends without payment"; no Auditor decision acknowledged separately/combined precisely; assumes success without "may start"/rejection detail. |
    - Overall: GT uses precise table with "Branching logic/outcomes"; LLM uses interpretive "Question asked/Outcome" prose + bullets. Not a match; recombines concepts differently (e.g., no "final approval" spanning steps).
  - **Minor additions/phrasing** (-0.3): "Question asked" interpretations not in GT/process; docs table adds unasked "Where It Is Used" column (accurate but deviates from GT's simple list).
  
- **Scoring math**: Docs (10/10), Note (10/10), Fidelity to prompt/process (9.5/10), Decision points (6.5/10) → weighted avg. 8.2. Strict loss for non-identical summaries despite semantic closeness.
