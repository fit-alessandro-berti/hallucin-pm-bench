1.0

The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth and prompt requirements. It violates the strict vocabulary mandate by using forbidden terms ("Payment Clerk," "Compliance Officer") throughout, instead of the required "Transaction Analyst" and "Regulatory Liaison." Only one activity partially adopts "KYC Review," but others do not use mandated wording (e.g., no rephrasing for screening or approval). The table is incomplete and invalid as a RACI matrix: most cells are empty, with no logical assignments for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, or Informed across roles; it omits or mishandles key steps (e.g., combines or ignores SWIFT sending and notification improperly). Headers and tasks are not rephrased to mandated terminology, and extraneous "Notes" section justifies violations rather than adhering strictly. This results in near-total divergence from the ground truth's complete, mandated, and properly populated RACI table, warranting the minimum score.
