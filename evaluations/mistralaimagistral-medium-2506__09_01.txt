The LLM answer correctly and clearly states that the average cycle time cannot be derived due to missing timestamp or duration data, aligns with the strict stance of the ground truth, and does not provide a fabricated value. Both the reasoning and the decision not to answer numerically match the ground truth precisely. No errors or omissions are present.
