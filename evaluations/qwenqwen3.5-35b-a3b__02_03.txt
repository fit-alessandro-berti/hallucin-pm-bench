9.0
- Q1 differs in conciseness (missing "cases" and case list, though numerically correct and prompt requests conciseness).
- Q2 identical in content.
- Q3 identical in content.
- Overall formatting lacks GT's labels (**A1**, etc.) and bolding, but adheres to "concise, bullet-point" instruction. Strict deduction for textual mismatches despite semantic accuracy.
