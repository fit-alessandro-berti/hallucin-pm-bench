6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but exhibits notable differences in structure, completeness, and precision, warranting a mid-range score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points Summary**:
  - The LLM identifies three decision points, mirroring the ground truth's count, and correctly covers the eligibility check (tied to *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*) and the high-value amount threshold branch (post-*Finance_Controller_PreApprove*).
  - However, it inaccurately frames *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* as a standalone "decision point" focused on signing off, without integrating it into a broader approval/rejection logic. The ground truth combines this with *Senior_Auditor_Review* as a unified "final payment approval" (#3), explicitly detailing branching outcomes (approved → payment; rejected → process ends). The LLM omits any explicit rejection possibility at this stage, which is a critical omission implied by the process constraints.
  - For the eligibility check (#1 in both), the LLM describes the check but fails to specify branching outcomes (e.g., "eligible → continue; not eligible → rejected"), reducing clarity and fidelity to the ground truth's table format with explicit logic.
  - The high-value branch (#3 in LLM, #2 in ground truth) is summarized accurately but lacks the ground truth's precise phrasing (e.g., "Amount ≤ €1 000 → skip auditor review") and conditional depth.
  - Overall structure: The LLM uses a simple numbered list without a table or explicit "branching logic/outcomes" column, making it less comprehensive and deviating from the ground truth's organized, analytical presentation. This introduces small but significant errors in summarization depth.

- **Required Documents List**:
  - The core list matches exactly (all seven documents from the process description are included, with no extras introduced).
  - Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's contextual notes: (1) *AuditTrail* as conditional ("only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue"); (2) the disclaimer reinforcing no other documents/activities (e.g., no legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide"). These notes ensure completeness and adherence to the prompt's warning against introducing undefined elements, which the LLM omits.

No violations of the prompt (e.g., no new activities/artefacts), and the response is concise/relevant. However, the differences in decision point detail and structure represent meaningful gaps from the ground truth, justifying a score below 7.0 despite strong coverage of essentials. A perfect match would require identical branching explicitness, integration of approval logic, and supplementary notes.
