7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Factual Accuracy (high marks, minor deduction):** 
- Correctly identifies all added tasks ("Check Customer VIP Status", "Generate RMA QR Code"), removed task ("Send RMA Label"), and gateway change (exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway). No speculation or extra differences reported. 
- Minor factual error: Added colon in "Warranty Valid?:" (XML name is exactly "Warranty Valid?" with no colon) — strict loss of 0.5 points.

**Format and Exactness Compliance (significant deductions):**
- Headings not exact: Missing required "•" prefix (prompt specifies "• Added tasks" etc.); plain text instead of **bold** as in ground truth/prompt style. Loss of 1.0.
- List markers: "-" instead of "*" as in ground truth. Minor but strict loss of 0.5.
- No IDs provided for tasks/gateway (ground truth explicitly includes "id = `check_vip`", etc., for precision; prompt implies "element names" likely refers to unique IDs from XML). Inconsistent identification (uses display "name" for all vs. ground truth's name+ID for tasks, ID for gateway). Loss of 0.5.
- Gateway phrasing less precise: "Warranty Valid?: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway" vs. ground truth's "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)" (no ID, no v1/v2, no bold types, uses →). Loss of 0.5.

**Overall:** Strong on core facts (9.5/10), but format deviations, missing precision details (IDs/versions), and small textual error prevent higher score under utmost strictness. No extraneous content, but not a near-exact match to ground truth structure/phrasing.
