9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high marks)**: Correctly identifies the exact three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), matching ground truth. Explanations strictly reference table data (e.g., wait times, processing times, rework, SLA breaches, stdev). Actions are concrete, tied to metrics (e.g., targets like 50% rework reduction, <5% SLA, 30% time cut), and data-driven. Memo is concise (~140 words), executive-style, no hallucinations or extraneous activities. Clear differentiation implied (no need to "say so").
- **Weaknesses (point deductions, strict lens)**: Misses key table metrics emphasized in ground truth—throughput drop (190 cases/day for Request_Documents, critical bottleneck signal); 30-min wait for Review_Documents (second-highest wait). Explanations slightly less comprehensive (infers "bottleneck/capacity constraints" without upstream/downstream flow like GT). Recommendations solid but less precise/innovative (generic "process redesign/training/add FTE" vs. GT's "automatic digital validation/AI triage/rule-engine" with direct queue/rework ties). No overall projection or title specificity. These omissions/differences (~20% content variance) deduct 1.0 pt.

Utmost strictness applied: Perfect match would be 10.0; measurable divergences in metric emphasis and rec specificity warrant deduction despite strong alignment.
