**10.0**

The LLM answer fully satisfies the prompt and aligns with all scoring notes under strict evaluation:
- **Correctness**: Top 3 activities ranked precisely by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h); quotes both avg and p95 waiting times verbatim from table.
- **No unwarranted content**: Strictly limited to these activities/waiting metrics; no service times, throughput, or extras.
- **Action relevance**: Each is concrete/logical for waiting-time bottleneck (e.g., pre-fill cuts doc submission delays; auto-trigger bypasses post-approval lag; predictive routing skips queues), explicitly promises ≥20% cut (30%, 25%, 22%), data-driven via projections without fabricating table data.
Minor phrasing variances (e.g., "Avg wait" vs "avg", "95th-pct" vs "p95") and memo header (enhancing "executive memo" format) are stylistic, not errors; ≤150 words. Perfect match on essentials despite action creativity.
