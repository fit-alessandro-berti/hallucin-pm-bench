7.0

- **R1:** Marked "Compliant" with a reasonable justification, matching ground truth.
- **R2:** Marked "Violated," but justification is vague and incomplete; ground truth correctly specifies post-change approvals set the window. LLM wrongly notes "shipped day-after-last approval (OK), but >2 day window overall"—but the relevant approval is the post-change Manager_Approval (07-Mar), not pre-shipping Finance_Approval (04-Mar). The LLM failed to point out that Ship_Goods occurred *before* the post-change approval, which is the real violation.
- **R3:** Correctly marked "Violated" with accurate justification.
- **R4:** "Not Applicable" for correct reason.
- **R5:** Correctly marked "Violated," but justification is less precise than ground truth—doesn't clearly mention both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice happened before new Manager_Approval.
- **R6:** Marked "Compliant" with a brief and correct justification.
- **Overall result:** Correct.

**Penalty rationale:**
- R2 justification is misleading/partially wrong, missing the critical element in the ground truth.
- R5 justification is imprecise, omitting details, but identifies the principal issue.
- R3, R1, R4, R6 are accurate.
- Briefness and lack of clarity in justifications compared to ground truth cost points.
- Formatting not per schema, but this was not explicit in prompt.

**Overall:** Moderate omissions and inaccuracies in justifications—especially for R2—warrant a stricter score: **7.0**.
