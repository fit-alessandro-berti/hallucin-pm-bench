6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Statuses (R1-R6 and Overall)**: All match ground truth exactly (Compliant for R1/R6, Violated for R2/R3/R5, Not Applicable for R4; NON-COMPLIANT overall). No deduction here.
- **Format**: LLM uses a concise list format close to the prompt's requirements (status + ≤20-word justification per rule), but lacks the structured table of ground truth. Minor deviation, but prompt doesn't mandate table—slight deduction for not mirroring expected presentation.
- **Justifications**:
  - R1: Accurate and concise. Matches.
  - R2: Significant error—misidentifies "last approval" (ignores post-change Manager_Approval on 07-Mar as the final required one) and incorrectly suggests partial compliance ("day-after-last approval (OK)"). Fails to explain violation properly (Ship_Goods precedes final approval, violating timing). Major accuracy loss; strict penalty.
  - R3: Accurate, though slightly informal ("1 day before" vs. precise dates). Acceptable.
  - R4: Accurate and equivalent.
  - R5: Mostly accurate (correctly flags missing approval before shipping post-change), but incomplete—omits Pay_Invoice (06-Mar) as another pre-approval step, unlike ground truth. Partial loss.
  - R6: Accurate and equivalent.
- **Overall Strictness**: Correct statuses save it from lower score, but flawed R2 justification (core misunderstanding of "last required approval") and minor R5 omission are substantive errors in a compliance audit context. Word limits respected, but precision lacking where it matters most.
