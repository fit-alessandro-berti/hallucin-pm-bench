9.0  
- Q1 matches closely (minor extra "distinct"; lists cases identically).  
- Q2 correct but overly verbose (restates question/case; ground truth is just name).  
- Q3 correct but adds unnecessary phrase ("appears exactly once").  
- Bullet format followed; content semantically perfect but not verbatim/minimal per ground truth and "concise" instruction. Strict deduction for phrasing/format differences.
