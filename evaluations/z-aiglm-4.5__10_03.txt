5.0

The LLM answer follows some aspects of the vocabulary policy—none of the forbidden synonyms appear, and only the four mandated terms are used. However, several significant errors, omissions, and non-conformances reduce the score:

**Major Issues:**
- Several activities are named incorrectly or are extraneous:
  - "Approval" is not a term in the process description—per the ground truth, the activity should be "Compliance Officer Approval." Ambiguity and lack of specificity are present.
  - "Payment Scheduling" and "Notification" are not listed activities per the ground truth and process narrative; "Release Funds" is missing as its own row.
- Roles marked as responsible/accountable for tasks do not match the ground truth. For instance:
  - For "Risk Scoring," the ground truth assigns R to Compliance Analyst and A to Compliance Officer; the LLM answer assigns both R and A only to Compliance Analyst (incorrect).
  - Consulted (“C”) and Informed (“I”) attributions are missing for nearly every activity, whereas the ground truth includes multiple “C” and “I” assignments.
  - Use of “R, A” for all tasks where the ground truth sometimes separates these roles (e.g., "Risk Scoring": R=Compliance Analyst, A=Compliance Officer).
- Activity names do not precisely match the vocabulary policy or ground truth:
  - "Release Funds" is replaced with "Funds Release"—not egregious, but still a minor deviation.
  - "Notification" is used instead of the ground truth's structure, and responsibilities are incorrectly assigned.

**Minor Issues:**
- The matrix includes more activities than required, some of which are not in the process narrative or are redundant.
- The dashes (“–”) for explicit “no involvement” are missing.
- Order and wording of activities do not strictly conform to the ground truth (e.g., combining or splitting steps).

**Summary:**  
While the LLM answer does avoid the forbidden vocabulary (which earns some credit) and the mandated terms do appear where activities align, the failure to accurately distribute R/C/A/I according to the ground truth and the addition/removal/renaming of activities are severe flaws. Thus, a score of **5.0** is warranted reflecting partial adherence but major logical inaccuracies.
