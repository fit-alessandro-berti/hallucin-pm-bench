The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Added and renamed activities**: The prompt mandates covering activities using only authorized vocabulary without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM incorrectly adds four extra activities ("Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification") not present in the ground truth, and renames them imprecisely (e.g., "Approval" vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Funds Release" vs. "Release Funds"). This violates the "do not add" rule directly and introduces unauthorized phrasings. Ground truth sticks to six inferred activities aligned with the narrative without extras.

- **Incomplete and inaccurate RACI assignments**: Numerous roles are omitted where the ground truth specifies involvement (e.g., for "Intake Vetting", LLM only assigns Front-Office Analyst R,A, missing Compliance Analyst C, Treasury Ops I, and Compliance Officer –; for "KYC Review" and "AML Screening", misses Compliance Officer C and Treasury Ops I). "Risk Scoring" is entirely wrong: LLM assigns Compliance Analyst R,A, but ground truth splits to Compliance Analyst R, Compliance Officer A, with Front-Office Analyst C and Treasury Ops I. "Notification" is fabricated with incorrect R,A to Treasury Ops. Even for partial matches (e.g., Treasury Ops R,A on "Funds Release"), broader context is ignored, leading to ~60% mismatch in assignments across rows.

- **Formatting errors**: Uses empty cells instead of dashes (–) for no involvement, lacks bolding on R,A entries, and has inconsistent table structure (e.g., no alignment with ground truth's precise headers and spacing). This reduces clarity and fidelity.

- **Vocabulary adherence**: The four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) are used exactly once each without synonyms leaking in, which is a minor positive. However, this is outweighed by the additions and overall inaccuracies.

These errors compound to make the output unreliable for process governance, with only superficial alignment on the core four activities' primary roles. No partial credit for intent, as strictness demands near-exact match.
