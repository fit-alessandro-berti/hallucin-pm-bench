### Evaluation Breakdown
The LLM answer fails critically on the core requirements, warranting a very low score under strict criteria. Key differences from the ground truth:

- **Activity Selection (Major Failure, -5 points)**: The prompt demands the *three worst-performing activities* based *jointly* on SLA breaches *and* high waiting time. Ground truth correctly identifies Legal Approval (+300s throughput breach, 600s wait – by far the worst), Risk Review (+300s, 480s wait), and Credit Assessment (+60s, 200s wait). LLM picks only one correct (Risk Review) but errs on Verify Identity (+30s, 80s wait – minor breach, not jointly worst) and Draft Offer (throughput 240s *under* 300s SLA, so no breach; 30s wait is low). This misidentifies bottlenecks, ignoring the highest waits/breaches (e.g., Legal's 600s wait > Risk's 480s).

- **Quantification Errors (Significant Loss, -2 points)**: For Risk Review, partial accuracy (+300s throughput vs. 300s SLA, 480s wait). But Verify Identity is correctly quantified yet irrelevant. Draft Offer is factually wrong: claims "300s against 300s SLA" (fabricated; actual throughput is 240s < SLA) and invents a "30s delay" tied to wait time, not throughput/SLA breach. Ground truth precisely uses throughput vs. SLA excess; LLM conflates and misreads data.

- **Recommendations (Partial but Flawed, -0.5 points)**: Prompt requires *one concrete, data-driven action* per activity, using bullets *only* for recommendations. LLM provides bullets but ties them to wrong activities; actions are vague/invented (e.g., "reduce below 240s" for Risk Review pulls 240s from another activity's data; "priority routing" and "batch processing" lack table-grounding like loan amounts or case volumes). Ground truth's are tightly data-driven (e.g., "low-risk files bypass," "add one analyst," "loans under €25k" – implying case data inference). LLM invents unsubstantiated targets/tools, violating "ground in data; do NOT invent."

- **Structure and Format (Minor but Penalized, -0.3 points)**: Ground truth uses formal memo format (To/From/Subject, narrative analysis, bullets only for recs, closing projection on 4,805 cases – derived from table data). LLM uses a title and bullets for *both* identification *and* recs (violating "bullet points only for recommendations"), no formal headers, no case total mention, and no projection. Word count ~180 (close to ~150) but irrelevant given content flaws.

- **Overall Fidelity and Inventions (Cumulative, -0.2 points)**: Ignores "mention no activity absent from table, no metrics not provided" by implying ungrounded elements (e.g., "real-time data feeds," "€25k" absent in LLM but present in ground truth's data-driven tie-in). No criminal/offensive issues, but core grounding violated.

This is not a minor deviation; it's a fundamental misanalysis, justifying minimal credit for partial overlap on one activity and basic structure.
