The LLM answer incorrectly concludes "Compliant" despite clear violations in Rules 2 and 3, as identified in the ground truth. Specific errors include: (1) For Rule 2, falsely claiming `Risk_Assessment` precedes `Ship_Goods` (it follows at event 9 after event 8); (2) For Rule 3, misnumbering events (e.g., labeling `Goods_Received` as event 7 instead of 6, duplicating numbering for event 7, and wrongly asserting distance â‰¤2 when it's actually 3, with `Three_way_match` at event 10 after events 7-9). Rules 1, 4, and 5 are correctly assessed as satisfied, but these major factual inaccuracies and the reversed overall verdict warrant a low score under strict evaluation criteria.
