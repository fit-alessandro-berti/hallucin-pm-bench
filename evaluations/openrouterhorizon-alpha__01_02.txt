### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall, accurately capturing the core decision points and required documents without introducing prohibited standard loan terminology. It uses exact activity names (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)"). However, under strict criteria, several small but notable differences from the ground truth warrant point deductions:

#### Decision Points (扣分: -1.5 total)
- **Completeness and Phrasing (Point 1)**: The LLM correctly describes the logic but generalizes to "two risk scores" instead of specifying "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B scores" as in the ground truth. It also adds "continue to step 6" (referencing "Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which is factually accurate but introduces unrequested process numbering not present in the ground truth's summary style. Ground truth emphasizes the "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" context, which is omitted. (-0.8)
- **Contextual Detail (Point 2)**: LLM omits "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check," a key positioning detail in the ground truth, making the summary slightly less precise about flow. Wording like "proceed to" vs. "send to" is minor but not identical. (-0.4)
- **Detail in Point 3**: LLM adds "(applies only when amount ≥ €15 000)," which is implied but not in the ground truth's concise "the board votes **Approve** or **Reject**." Capitalization differs (approve/reject vs. **Approve**/**Reject**), and the extra parenthetical is an unnecessary elaboration. (-0.3)

The structure (numbered list) aligns well, but these omissions and additions create minor deviations from the ground truth's exact phrasing and focus.

#### Required Documents (扣分: -0.3 total)
- The list is complete and matches all items without extras or omissions.
- Minor wording variances: 
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months)" – extraneous "old." (-0.1)
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "Latest Income Statement (pay-stub/tax slip)" – adds "single," altering the exact phrasing. (-0.1)
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "Community Impact Statement (CIS)" – includes unneeded "template." (-0.1)
- Formatting: Bullets vs. numbered list is stylistic and not a major error, but ground truth uses numbering.
- Omission of the ground truth's closing note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") is not required by the prompt, so no deduction, but it enhances completeness in the ground truth.

Total score reflects high fidelity (90%+ alignment) but penalizes every small discrepancy as instructed. No major errors like missing points or invalid terminology.
