8.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth, demonstrating strict adherence to the process’ terminology and flow. Here’s a breakdown of discrepancies and accuracy:

Strengths:
- Uses the exact activity names as in the process: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- Clearly explains decision logic at each point, matching the source.
- Lists every required document by the correct name; no extraneous items added.

Minor Issues resulting in loss of points:
- The answer says “Board votes approve or reject (applies only when amount ≥ €15 000)”—though this is contextually accurate, the ground truth format simply states “board votes Approve or Reject.” The note in the LLM could be seen as a (minor) redundancy or slightly less crisp format.
- In the required documents list, the ground truth clarifies “(pay-stub/tax slip)” and “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” (without “template”), while the LLM adds “(single pay-stub or tax slip)” and “template.” These are very minor wording differences but show a failure to perfectly reproduce the expected phrasing.
- The LLM answer does not state, “No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard documents are needed,” as given in the ground truth.

Given the instruction to be extremely strict, even small changes or omissions should be penalized. None of the above is a critical process error, but together they merit a reduction from a perfect score.

Final score: 8.0
