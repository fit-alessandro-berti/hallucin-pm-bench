The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and evidence-based, closely aligning with the ground truth in verdict, case citations, and key observations (reversed ordering in 1001 and 1003; absence in 1002 disproving "always"). Minor deductions for slightly less structured formatting (no explicit "verdict" header or line-based references) and not reiterating "immediately" in counterexamples, though this does not alter the factual correctness or completeness.
