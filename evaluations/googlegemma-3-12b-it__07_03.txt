The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact IDs, names, and gateway type shifts matching the ground truth content. However, it omits the bullet points ("-") used in the ground truth for each item under all headings, resulting in a plain line-separated list instead of bulleted formatting. Additionally, the second gateway entry lacks the alignment spaces after the colon seen in the ground truth ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" vs. "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel"). These formatting discrepancies, though minor, violate the strict requirement to match the ground truth precisely, leading to a deduction.
