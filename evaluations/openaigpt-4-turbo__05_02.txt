The LLM answer proposes an entirely different, ineffective, and BPMN-invalid change (adding a non-standard attribute-form conditionExpression to a sequenceFlow without an alternative path, variable definition, or dueDate adjustment), failing to match the ground truth's precise dueDate reduction on Task_CollectEquipment; the rationale is speculative rather than directly SLA-corrective, violating strict fidelity to the expected single-hunk diff and solution.
