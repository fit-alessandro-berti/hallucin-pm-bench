The LLM answer is accurate and complete for questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth exactly in counts and calculations (no deductions). For question 3, the response is concise (under 100 words), addresses low support/rarity (implying the single occurrence from prior context), notes instability risks (e.g., overfitting, distortion of metrics, reduced accuracy), and cautions against over-generalizationâ€”meeting the core criteria. However, it slightly diverges from the sample's emphasis on n=1-specific statistical noise (e.g., no mention of confidence intervals or single-observation skew), opting for broader modeling concerns, warranting a minor deduction under strict evaluation.
