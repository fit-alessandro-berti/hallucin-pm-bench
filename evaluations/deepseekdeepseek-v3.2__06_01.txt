**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can run in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), in correct alphabetical order both within pairs (C<Q, P<S) and across the list (C before P). No extra or missing pairs, fully matching semantic ground truth.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for formatting discrepancies under utmost strictness:
- Spacing around em dash: LLM uses single spaces ("Task — Task") vs. ground truth/example's double spaces ("Task  —  Task").
- Missing columnar alignment of em dashes (ground truth pads second line with ~5 spaces after "Procure_Materials" to align — at ~column 22; LLM left-justifies without padding).

These are small whitespace errors but warrant significant point loss per instructions; still high score as core content/output structure is pixel-perfect match otherwise.
