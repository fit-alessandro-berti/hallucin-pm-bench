4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core changes: the three added tasks, the one removed task, and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive. However, under utmost strictness, several deviations from the ground truth and prompt requirements significantly lower the score:

- **Extraneous content and non-compliance with structure**: The prompt demands changes "grouped under exactly these headings" with no additional sections. The LLM includes an unrequested "### Key Notes" section with structural analysis, renaming mentions (even if correct to ignore), and gateway impact explanations. This violates the "strictly" directive, adding interpretive content beyond summarization. Ground truth is purely list-based under headings, with no extras—deducting ~2 points for format deviation.

- **Overly descriptive listings**: Ground truth uses concise, neutral lists (e.g., "Verify Identity (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"). The LLM adds unnecessary details like "inserted after start event", "as a new gateway outcome path", "as a replacement for the removed rejection task", and "deleted entirely". These are small but unrequested embellishments, implying analysis not called for, leading to significant loss (~1.5 points) per the strictness rule.

- **Misplaced and incorrect detail in "Gateway-type changes"**: Ground truth limits this to the type change (exclusive → inclusive, with XOR/OR notation). The LLM's first bullet is accurate, but the second bullet incorrectly categorizes flow expansions ("yes/no" to three named flows) and parallelization as a "gateway-type change". This is not a type change (e.g., not Exclusive → Inclusive) but a flow/structure alteration, which the prompt instructs to ignore unless fitting the exact category. Placing it here introduces an error—deducting ~2 points for inaccuracy and misclassification.

No other changes (e.g., flows, renamings) are invented, and cosmetics are properly ignored, preserving some credit. Overall, while functionally mostly correct, the additions inflate and distort the strict summary format, justifying a mid-low score.
