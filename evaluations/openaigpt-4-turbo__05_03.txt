**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major semantic error (catastrophic, -5.0)**: Timer attached to `Activity_VerifyID` (starts countdown at **start** of Verify Identity, non-interrupting), enforcing wrong duration (Verify ID time, not "within 48h of **finishing** Verify Identity" to complete Create Account). Fails SLA enforcement entirely—if Verify ID finishes quickly but Create Account exceeds 48h, no escalation occurs.
- **Technical inaccuracies (-1.5)**: `cancelActivity="false"` (non-interrupting, doesn't halt violating task); missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` in `timeDuration`; no `name` attribute; generic IDs.
- **Justification mismatch (-1.0)**: Claims countdown "starts" correctly for SLA (false—triggers on Verify ID start, skips Create Account monitoring); doesn't precisely match ground truth phrasing or logic.
- **Partial credit (+0.5)**: Uses boundary timer + existing `Activity_AMReview` + sequence flow (no new activities); returns only changed XML + 1-sentence justification.
- **Format minor issues (-0.0)**: Mostly adheres (XML block + sentence), but lacks ground truth's comments/numbering precision.

Total differences render it non-compliant; ground truth precisely targets `Activity_CreateAccount` (interrupting, correct timing/scope).
