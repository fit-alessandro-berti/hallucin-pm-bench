**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match in substance to the ground truth across all questions, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log data, or factual errors. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "1 time" vs. "1 occurrence"; "5.56%" vs. "5.56 %"; singular "case identifier" vs. plural allowance) are stylistic and do not alter correctness. For Q4, both reasons directly align with ground truth options ("small sample size" and "temporal bias"), stated clearly and derived solely from the fragment (4 cases, 1 day). No deductions warranted under strict evaluation.
