**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" and provides the critical shortest prefix (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5) to enable and fire T5 without prior T3, with an accurate marking table and solid explanation/minimality for that prefix. However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:

- **Major difference**: The listed firing sequence is incomplete (length 4 vs. ground truth's length 6: T1, T2b, T4, T5, **T6, T3**). The query requires a "**shortest** firing sequence" demonstrating T5 firing *before* T3, which necessitates including T3 after T5 to exhibit the ordering (via feedback T6 → pc → T3). LLM stops at T5, omitting T6/T3 and never showing T3 fire after, failing to fully prove the ordering in the sequence.
- **Explanation gaps**: Ignores feedback loop (T6) and how T3 is re-enabled post-T5; ground truth emphasizes this. LLM's phrasing ("before any occurrence of T3") implies T3 may never fire, misaligning with ground truth's demonstration of both firing (T5 then T3).
- **Minimality error**: Claims length 4 is "**shortest** possible" for the query, but ground truth proves length 6 is minimal for a sequence with T5 < T3 (correct lower bound 4 for T5, +2 extra justified).
- **Minor diffs**: Detailed table is stronger than ground truth's abbreviated markings, but format/style (bold/table vs. numbered list) and phrasing differ; no mention of T6/T3 consumptions.

Core path/table/most logic match (~70% overlap), but sequence omission, wrong length claim, and missing feedback proof are significant errors warranting ~3-point deduction from 10.0.
