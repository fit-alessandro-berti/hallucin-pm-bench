1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and directly contradicts the ground truth. It wrongly concludes "No" for Q1, missing the alternative path (T2-T7-T4) that enables T5 via P5 without consuming P2 first, allowing T5 to fire before T3. The explanation for Q2 ignores this path and falsely assumes mutual exclusivity prevents any sequence where T5 precedes T3. No partial credit for brevity or structure, as the core analysis is entirely erroneous.
