2.0

The LLM's answer is incorrect for both questions:

- For Question 1, it incorrectly answered "No," while the correct answer is "Yes" (T5 can fire before T3).
- For Question 2, its justification is flawed and does not consider the possible sequence via T1 → T2 → T7 → T4, which produces a token in P5 before T3 fires. It wrongly asserts that T5 and T3 are mutually exclusive due to their competition for token P2, failing to see that T5's enabling also requires P5, which can be achieved independently via another token flow.

The only mitigating factor is that the LLM did attempt to engage with the transition dependencies and token flow, which prevents a score of 1.0. However, the core logic is entirely incorrect and the answer does not match the ground truth, resulting in a very low score.
