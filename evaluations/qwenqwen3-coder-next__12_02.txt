The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a one-paragraph justification citing the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), matching the ground truth's logic and evidence precisely. It adds accurate timestamps for C003 (unnecessary but not erroneous) and maintains the required format. Minor deductions for awkward/grammatically flawed phrasing in the C005 description ("appears at line 11 before *Receive_Order* does not occur at all"), which reduces clarity compared to the ground truth's precise "but never contains *Receive_Order* at all," and for lacking the explicit "counter-examples" summary phrasing that ties back to "not always."
