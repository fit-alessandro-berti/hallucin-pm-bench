### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and comprehensive, closely aligning with the ground truth in identifying exactly 3 decision points with similar branching logic/outcomes (eligibility validation, high-value threshold, and pre-payment approval conditions). The required documents list is identical (7 items, including the conditional note on AuditTrail). No unauthorized activities or artifacts are introduced, adhering strictly to the prompt.

Minor deductions (total -1.0 point) for:
- **Phrasing and precision in decision points (-0.5)**: Slight trigger mismatch in #1 (LLM places it after submission but before triage activity; ground truth specifies "during" triage). #3 is well-inferred but frames the decision as a distinct "pre-payment check" including documents, whereas ground truth integrates it directly into the approval steps without mentioning documents thereâ€”subtly interpretive difference.
- **Format and structure (-0.5)**: LLM uses verbose bullet lists and an extra summary section, diverging from ground truth's concise table + list. While informative and not erroneous, it adds unrequested elaboration under strict fidelity.

Overall, differences are small and do not alter core meaning, but per instructions, they warrant noticeable point loss despite strong adherence.
