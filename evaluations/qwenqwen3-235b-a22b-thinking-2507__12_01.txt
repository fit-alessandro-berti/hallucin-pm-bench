**Score: 9.0**

**Justification for Scoring:**

The LLM answer is highly accurate, meticulous, and strictly evidence-based, as required by the instructions. It provides detailed, case-by-case analysis, directly referencing timestamps and activity sequences from the event-log fragment, and clearly disproves the fact under review.

**Strengths:**
- States clearly that the fact is inaccurate.
- Cites specific cases (1001, 1002, 1003) and correctly describes the observed sequences.
- Notes that in Case 1002, `Update_Inventory` is absent (thus, the "always" in the fact is disproved).
- For cases 1001 & 1003, it correctly identifies that `Update_Inventory` occurs before, not after, `Authorize_Refund`, and that the claimed immediate succession never happens.
- The answer is structured, clear, and assigns direct evidence for each assertion, in line with the ground truth.

**Minor Deductions:**
- The justification in the LLM answer could be slightly more concise. The ground truth is somewhat terser and highlights directly that the order is reversed in all observed sequences, whereas the LLM answer adds extra detail about activity predecessors that, while accurate, is not strictly necessary and could be considered noise.
- The LLM answer says "Instead, `Update_Inventory` is consistently preceded by `Inspect_Item`," which is correct, but is slightly less direct than stating the reversal of the claimed ordering.
- The phrase "Instead, `Update_Inventory` is consistently preceded by `Inspect_Item`, and `Authorize_Refund` appears later in the sequence" might be seen as just a nuance away from the clearest possible disproof (as found in the reference answer: "the claimed ordering is reversed"), though this is extremely minor.

**Summary:**  
The answer is thorough and accurate, but to be maximally concise and perfectly aligned with the ground truth, a slightly more direct reference to the reversal of ordering would be optimal. Thus, it is scored 9.0 out of 10.
