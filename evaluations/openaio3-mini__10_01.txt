6.0

Rationale:

**Vocabulary Policy (Strictness Adhered To):**
- The LLM answer uses only the approved terms: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance." Forbidden terms are not present. (+0 points lost)

**Activities:**
- The activity names are converted to the preferred terminology when needed. (+0 points lost)

**Roles:**
- Columns are correct as per the prompt. (+0 points lost)

**RACI Assignments (Main Issues):**
- The matrix diverges significantly from the ground truth in many assignments:
    - For *Receive Application*, ground truth gives Account Manager (R/A), Compliance Officer (C), Finance Clerk (I), IT Support (I). LLM gives Account Manager (R/A) and others blank.
    - For *KYC Review*, ground truth is Account Manager (A), Compliance Officer (R), Finance Clerk (C), IT Support (I). LLM gives Account Manager (I), Compliance Officer (R/A).
    - For *Order Vetting*, ground truth is Account Manager (R/A), Compliance Officer (C), Finance Clerk (I), IT Support (I). LLM gives Account Manager (R/A), Compliance Officer (C).
    - For *Payment Clearance*, ground truth is Account Manager (A), Compliance Officer (C), Finance Clerk (R), IT Support (I). LLM gives Account Manager (I), Finance Clerk (R/A).
    - For *Record Update*, ground truth is Account Manager (C), Compliance Officer (I), Finance Clerk (C), IT Support (R). LLM gives only IT Support (R/A).
    - For *Notify Customer*, ground truth is Account Manager (R/A), others (I). LLM gives only Account Manager (R/A).

**Scoring Justification:**
- Approximate, but not precise, mirroring of the RACI assignments. Multiple role assignments are omitted or incorrect, especially regarding Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles, which are almost always missing in the LLM answer.
- Responsibility (R) and Accountability (A) tend to be present for primary roles, but the finer detail is missing.
- The basic structure, headings, terminology, and prohibition rules are followed—but the granular RACI is significantly off.

**Deductions:**
- Minor errors (e.g., missing participants as Informed/Consulted) are required to be penalized harshly.
- While the main Responsible parties are present, many secondary C/I roles are wrong or absent.
- Severe but not total loss of information; user can see the process and main role, but not the full RACI network.

**Final:** 6.0 — The answer uses correct terminology and keeps the structure, but is significant off in RACI role attribution per the ground truth, especially on secondary roles.
