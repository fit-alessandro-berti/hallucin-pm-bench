3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary adherence (strong match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exclusively, with exact capitalization. No forbidden terms appear, fully aligning with the strict policy and ground truth.
- **Structure and format (partial match, +1.0 point)**: Activities as rows and roles as columns are correctly implemented in a table format. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are added (meets "unwarranted content" criterion). However, minor deviations include unnecessary numbering (1.-6.), dashed lines/borders instead of clean Markdown, lack of bolding on key R/A and R entries as in ground truth, and addition of an explanatory key and self-referential sentence, which introduce unwarranted content.
- **RACI allocations (poor match, -5.5 points total, strict deduction)**: Significant differences from ground truth, violating "correctness" and "RACI allocations reflect the narrative" criteria. Core issues:
  - Each activity has one Responsible (good, but often combined as R/A where ground truth separates R and A, e.g., KYC Review: CO R/A vs. CO R/AM A).
  - Account Manager accountability is partially placed (e.g., correct R/A on Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer) but misplaced or omitted elsewhere (e.g., KYC Review: AM I vs. A; Payment Clearance: AM I vs. A).
  - Major omissions of Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles across nearly all activities, treating them as "–" (implying no involvement) instead of specifying per ground truth. Examples:
    - Receive Application: Missing CO C, FC I, IT I (3 errors).
    - KYC Review: Missing FC C, IT I; AM I vs. A (3 errors).
    - Order Vetting: Missing FC I, IT I (2 errors).
    - Payment Clearance: AM I vs. A, missing CO C/IT I; FC R/A vs. R (3 errors).
    - Record Update: Missing AM C, CO I, FC C (3 errors); IT R/A vs. R.
    - Notify Customer: Missing CO I, FC I, IT I (3 errors).
  - Total: ~17 cell-level differences out of 24 cells, with no activity fully matching. Small errors (e.g., R/A vs. separate R/A, – vs. I/C) compound to show incomplete inference from the narrative, warranting heavy deduction under strictness rules.
- **Overall strictness adjustment (-1.0 point)**: While main handlers are roughly inferred, the matrix is minimally detailed and does not "reflect the narrative" fully (e.g., ignoring implied consultations/informations in a workflow context). No self-awareness issues, but extraneous notes dilute focus.

This yields a low score due to pervasive mismatches in RACI details, despite vocabulary success. A perfect match would require exact cell contents, including all C/I placements and separated R/A where applicable.
