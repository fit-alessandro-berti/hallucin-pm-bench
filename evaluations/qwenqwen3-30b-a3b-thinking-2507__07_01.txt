Added tasks  
The LLM answer lists only the element names (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), while the ground truth requires both the task name and the element id, in the explicit format: *Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)*, etc. The LLM omits the descriptive task names, which is a significant information loss (−1 point per missing name).

Removed tasks  
Again, only the element name (`send_rma_label`) is listed, missing the required name and explicit id format (−1 point).

Gateway type changes  
The entry is just `gw_valid` — whereas the ground truth calls for the id plus a description of the type change: *`gw_valid` changed from exclusiveGateway (v1) to inclusiveGateway (v2)* (−1 point).

Additionally, the LLM answer omits bold formatting and does not use list formatting for items, which is minor but presentational (−0.5).

The headings are correct and the items under each are correct, so no content errors or hallucinations. However, the answer is incomplete and does not match the level of detail in the ground truth.

Strict score: 7.0
