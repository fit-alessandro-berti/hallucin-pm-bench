The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth for questions 1 and 2 (exact counts and percentages, properly formatted and calculated). For question 3, the response is concise (under 100 words), cautions against over-generalization, and addresses misleading impacts on performance/predictive analyses (e.g., inaccurate models, flawed metrics). However, it deducts minor points for not explicitly emphasizing the "single-occurrence" vulnerability or statistical instability/variance (e.g., skewing averages, wide confidence intervals) as in the ground truth criteria—instead focusing more on frequency assumptions and triggers—representing a small but notable deviation in precision.
