**9.5**

**Justification:**

**1. Correctness of Answers**
- Q1: Correctly identifies "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs once. ✔️
- Q2a: Correct percentage (1/48 = 2.08%) and reports to two decimals. ✔️
- Q2b: Correct percentage (1/12 = 8.33%) and reports to two decimals. ✔️
- Q3: The explanation correctly highlights that conclusions from single events are unreliable and can skew analysis (mentions "disproportionately influence", "incorrectly assume", "misinterpret", and consequences). Points (i), (ii), and (iii) from the rubric are addressed, although less explicitly than the ground truth, but still sufficiently for strict grading. ✔️

**2. Minor stylistic/strictness notes**
- The Q3 explanation does not explicitly use the terms "variance/instability" or "confidence intervals remain wide," but does reference statistical unreliability and is otherwise complete.
- For utmost strictness, not deploying the technical language from the rubric in Q3 (explicit mention of confidence or statistical variance) warrants a slight deduction.

**3. No invented information or errors are present.**

**Conclusion:**  
The LLM answer is extremely close to ground truth, with very minor reduction for less precise technical phrasing in Q3. Thus, **9.5**.
