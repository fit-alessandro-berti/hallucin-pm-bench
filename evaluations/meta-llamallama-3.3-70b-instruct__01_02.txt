8.0

The LLM answer is largely accurate and follows the instructions closely, but strict grading reveals a few small but real deviations:

**Positive points:**
- Correctly identifies the three decision points with exact process activity names.
- Clearly lists all six required documents, using mostly the correct terminology and order.
- Does not introduce standard loan terminology.

**Minor inaccuracies resulting in point deductions:**
1. **Placement of “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)”**: The LLM places this as a standalone bullet after the Amount Threshold Decision, but doesn't explicitly note it's conditional (only applies for ≥ €15,000), though this is somewhat implied by the sequence. The ground truth highlights this conditional more explicitly.
2. **Document List Slight Deviations:**
   - LLM says "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template"; the ground truth says just "Community Impact Statement (CIS)". (The inclusion of "template" is not per source.)
   - LLM writes "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" versus the ground truth's "(pay-stub/tax slip)", which is a slight rephrasing.
   - LLM writes "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs ground truth's "≤ 3 months". (Small wording difference.)
3. **Lack of explicit mention that no standard loan documents are needed.** The ground truth specifically mentions this ("No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed"), but the LLM omits this clarification.
4. **Slight Conflation of Sequence:** Not all decision points are specifically placed "after" their linked process step, which the ground truth makes explicit.

**Overall:** These are minor issues, but per instructions each must be penalized, so a deduction of 2.0 points is warranted. Thus, the strictly accurate score is **8.0**.
