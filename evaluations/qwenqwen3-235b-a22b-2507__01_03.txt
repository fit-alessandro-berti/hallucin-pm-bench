6.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM accurately identifies and describes:
    1. The branching condition after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Low/Medium risk, ≤ €250,000 → skip Step 5).
    2. The TriVote approval requirement (any two of three approve → pass).
- However, the LLM incorrectly lists the initial outcome of the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (just determining risk level) as a “decision point.” The system prompt only asks for gates/branches—places where the process flow diverges based on a rule—not for intermediate calculations or assessments. This is a definitional error, reflecting insufficient adherence to process logic.
- The rules are otherwise well summarized, but this extra step is significant enough to warrant a notable deduction according to the user's "utmost strictness" requirement.

**b) Document listing**

- The LLM mostly lists all documents and orders most correctly: Form 14B, Scorecard–Cyan/Magenta/Yellow, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025.
- However, it omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77," which is specifically required at Step 8 (the applicant must confirm by signing and returning it). The ground truth correctly includes this as a distinct required document, and its absence is a non-trivial oversight.
- The LLM does not hallucinate documents, which is good, but the omission of one required document is a significant error per the user's grading criteria.

**Summary:**  
- The LLM demonstrates good comprehension but:
    - Includes one extraneous decision point.
    - Omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" from the required documents list.

Both of these errors, particularly the missing required document and the misunderstanding of what constitutes a decision point, represent more than small flaws and justify a stringent reduction in score. Hence, **6.0**.
