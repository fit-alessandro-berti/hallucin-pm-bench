**8.0**

The LLM answer accurately identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint criteria of SLA breaches (using Avg_Throughput_Time vs Target_SLA) and high Avg_Waiting_Time, with identical quantifications (+300s, +300s, +60s respectively, paired with waits of 600s, 480s, 200s). All sentences are grounded in table data without extraneous metrics or activities. Memo format is executive-appropriate (~160 words), uses bullets *only* for recommendations (each one concrete and explicitly data-referencing throughput/waiting/cases/SLA gaps), and returns only memo text.

Differences from ground truth (minor under strictness, but deducting 2.0 total): 
- Header variations (added "MEMO"/date; From phrasing close but not identical; different subject).
- Analysis presented in prose vs. bulleted/bold list (no prompt spec for this).
- Intro wording/structure differs (no total cases or "queues" phrasing; no markdown).
- Recommendations are entirely different actions (plausible/data-tied but non-matching).
- No closing projection (good, as it avoids invention).

Core factual/structural fidelity high; rec phrasing is the main divergence.
