The LLM answer is factually accurate, correctly identifying the added tasks ("check_vip" and "generate_qr" by name), the removed task ("send_rma_label" by name), and the gateway type change for "gw_valid" (exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway). It adheres to the prompt's required categories, uses exact headings with the specified "•" prefix, lists only relevant XML differences, and includes no speculation or extras.

However, under utmost strictness, there are notable textual and formatting differences from the ground truth:
- Headings use plain "• Heading" vs. ground truth's **bold Heading** without "•".
- List items use "-" bullets vs. ground truth's "*".
- Tasks use only quoted names (e.g., "- "Check Customer VIP Status"") vs. ground truth's name + explicit id (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip` )"), omitting ids entirely (significant omission as ground truth includes them precisely).
- Gateway description: "- Changed from "exclusiveGateway" to "inclusiveGateway" for "Warranty Valid?"" vs. ground truth's "* `gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)", differing in identifier (name vs. id), phrasing, quotes, no bolding, and missing version labels.
- No trailing note "(No other differences should be reported.)" or equivalent.
- Minor: extra spacing/newlines, quotes around names/types not in ground truth.

These accumulate to prevent a higher score despite semantic match; small format/omission errors deduct significantly (~0.75-1.0 points each across 4-5 issues).
