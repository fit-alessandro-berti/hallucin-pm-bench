3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This evaluation is strictly based on fidelity to the ground truth answer, penalizing omissions, additions, structural mismatches, and inaccuracies with significant point deductions (e.g., missing core elements like the scorecards deducts ~2 points alone; extraneous decision points deduct ~1.5 points; incomplete document sequencing deducts ~2 points; minor phrasing/ordering issues deduct ~1 point). The LLM answer partially captures the essence but introduces errors that substantially diverge from the ground truth.

#### Part (a): Decision Points (Ground Truth: 2 precise points; Score: ~4.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly identifies and describes the core rules for the risk-based skip (Low/Medium risk + ≤ €250,000 skips step 5) and TriVote (at least two approvals from the three roles). No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions).
- **Errors/Deductions**:
  - Adds an extraneous third decision point ("Manual Underwriting Review"), framing it as a conditional branch based on risk/amount, which mischaracterizes step 5 as a "decision" rather than a procedural step triggered by the prior decision. Ground truth has only two decision points and integrates the risk logic into one (the skip condition).
  - Splits the risk check into two overlapping points (1 and 2), creating redundancy and diluting precision; ground truth condenses it into a single, clear "risk-based skip" point.
  - Phrasing is wordier and less concise (e.g., "any two approvals out of three suffice to pass" vs. ground truth's "at least two... record 'Approve'"), but the rule is substantively accurate—minor deduction for style mismatch.
- Overall for (a): Captures rules but structural additions/omissions make it a loose match (not "every decision point" summarized in one sentence each as precisely as ground truth).

#### Part (b): Documents List (Ground Truth: 9 items in exact first-appearance order; Score: ~2.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly includes Form 14B (first), Deck Memo (step 5), Offer Sheet 77 (step 7), ID Matrix Declaration (step 8, paired with signing), and Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9). Order among included items is mostly sequential. Adds helpful (but unrequested) descriptions without hallucinations.
- **Errors/Deductions**:
  - **Major omission**: Completely misses the three scorecards (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow), which appear first in step 3 as explicit inputs/documents for Tri-Color-Risk-Check. These are required "anywhere in the process" and must be listed in first-appearance order—ground truth places them early (#2-4). This alone is a critical gap, as the prompt asks for "**all** documents."
  - Incomplete handling of Offer Sheet 77: Ground truth separates "Offer Sheet 77" (#6, unsigned, step 7) from "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (#7, step 8) as distinct first appearances. LLM merges them into one (#3), losing the signing nuance.
  - Deck Memo (#2 in LLM) is placed too early; it first appears *after* the scorecards (step 5), so order is disrupted.
  - Result: Only 5/9 items listed, with sequencing errors—far from a complete, ordered match.

#### Overall Score Calculation
- Combined: Parts (a) and (b) are weighted equally. (4.0 + 2.0)/2 = 3.0. Strictness applied: No partial credit for "close enough" (e.g., scorecards are not optional); divergences compound to show the LLM answer as incomplete and imprecise.
