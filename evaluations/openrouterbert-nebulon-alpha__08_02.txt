**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: Q1 claims "No" (vs. ground truth "Yes"), with flawed reasoning ignoring the T1→T2→T7→T4 path that enables P5 without firing T3, leaving P2 available for T5. The provided sequence `[T1, T3, T4, T5]` shows T5 *after* T3, failing to demonstrate the question. No valid counterexample or correct sequence given. Total reversal of truth warrants minimum score.
