The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance but has substantial errors in the justifications compared to the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- Rule 1: LLM incorrectly labels it a "violation" despite correctly describing satisfaction (mislabeled and confusing).
- Rule 2: Matches ground truth (correct violation identified).
- Rule 3: LLM errs by stating it "satisfies" (claims distance from event 6 to 10 is compliant), but ground truth correctly flags a violation (distance = 3 > 2). This is a major factual error in rule assessment.
- Rule 4: LLM incorrectly claims a violation (misinterprets the rule as prohibiting Intern after Warehouse_Clerk, when it specifically bars Intern directly after CFO; ground truth confirms satisfaction). Introduces a false violation.
- Rule 5: Matches ground truth (satisfied).

These inaccuracies (errors in 3/5 rules, including mislabeling, false compliance, and false violation) significantly deviate from the ground truth's precise assessments, despite the correct overall conclusion. Small errors like the Rule 1 labeling compound the issues, justifying major point deduction.
