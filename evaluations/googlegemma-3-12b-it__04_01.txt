6.5

- The LLM correctly identifies the case as “Non-compliant.”
- **Rule 1**: Correctly states it is satisfied.
- **Rule 2**: Correctly identifies that Risk_Assessment occurs after Ship_Goods, violating the rule.
- **Rule 3**: Major error. The LLM incorrectly claims Rule 3 is satisfied: it says Three_way_match is within the allowed distance, but in fact, it occurs 3 events after Goods_Received (should be within 2). This is a clear mistake, losing significant points.
- **Rule 4**: Misstates the rule scope. The LLM incorrectly suggests a violation because an Intern activity follows a Warehouse_Clerk and not a CFO (the rule is only about Intern immediately after CFO). This misreading leads not only to an incorrect claim of a violation, but also confusion in justification.
- **Rule 5**: Correct.

Errors in evaluating rules 3 and 4 (one false compliant claim, one false violation claim), plus small imprecision in justification, result in a substantial deduction. The answer gets credit for the correct non-compliance call and for addressing and discussing each rule, but strict grading (because even small mistakes matter) brings this down to a 6.5.
