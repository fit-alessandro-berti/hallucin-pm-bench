The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core contentâ€”correctly identifying the absence of data in Artefact A (headers only, no timestamps or rows), the need for start/complete times to calculate cycle time, the irrelevance of Artefact B's inter-activity KPI, and the impossibility of deriving the average, standard deviation, or confidence interval. It adheres to the task structure by addressing points 1-3 explicitly and provides a precise, non-guessing reason in a single short paragraph. Minor deductions for slight structural deviation (numbered list vs. integrated paragraph), overuse of bold formatting (potentially deviating from strict plain text), and marginally wordier phrasing that adds emphasis (e.g., "granular data") without exact replication of the ground truth's concise "Impossible" opener and "dispersion" terminology.
