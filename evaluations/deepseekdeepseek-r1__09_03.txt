The LLM answer is excellent and closely matches the ground truth. It correctly and explicitly states that the metrics cannot be computed and provides a precise technical justification, referring both to the absence of data rows and event timestamps, and clarifies why the available KPI from Artefact B is not usable for the asked calculation.

Small deductions are warranted for the following minor points:

- The ground truth condenses its response into a single paragraph, while the LLM splits its answer into bullet points/sections. While this does not add incorrectness, it departs slightly from the compactness requested ("in one short paragraph—do not guess or draw on outside knowledge").
- The LLM uses the phrase "cannot be computed" twice in the numbered list, which could be seen as a little repetitive rather than immediately summarizing the impossibility in a single succinct statement as in the ground truth.
- The explanation, while accurate, is a bit more verbose than strictly necessary for the client's guidance (ground truth is more concise).

These issues are minor—the LLM's response is technically correct, fully justified, and makes no unfounded assumptions. Thus, only a small deduction is made.
