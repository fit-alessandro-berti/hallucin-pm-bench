The LLM answer includes all and only the correct differences with correct id/name pairs and gateway type changes. However, it omits the required bullet-point formatting and exact spacing of each item under the headings as found in the GROUND TRUTH ANSWER. The correct response must use bullets and preserve the formatting exactly as in the ground truth ("- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)" instead of "Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)"), including the indentation and presence of hyphens. This is a formatting error, which deducts a significant amount given the instructions for strictness. Content-wise, everything else is accurate and in the proper order.
