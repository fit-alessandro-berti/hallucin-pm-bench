The LLM answer correctly concludes “No”, states that rule 3 is violated, and addresses each rule explicitly. The justifications provided are clear and accurate—with the only minor deduction being the relative lack of fully parallel structure and tabular clarity seen in the ground truth (e.g., marking satisfaction with ✔ or ❌, using a table, and slight differences in sentence formulation). Also, in rule 4 the LLM uses the symbol “⇒” instead of explicit wording. These are minor stylistic and format omissions but do not affect the substance. The reasoning, referencing, and conclusion match the official answer precisely. Thus, with utmost strictness, the answer loses a moderate fraction of a point for format and explicitness.
