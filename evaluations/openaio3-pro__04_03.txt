The LLM answer is factually accurate, correctly identifies the "No" compliance verdict, and provides a short justification referencing all four rules with appropriate satisfied/violated assessments, mirroring the ground truth's logic and reasoning without errors. Minor deductions for format differences (plain text vs. structured table) and slightly less emphatic wording in Rule 3 (e.g., not explicitly reiterating "both QE and RA are finished" as in ground truth), but these are cosmetic and do not alter the core assessment.
