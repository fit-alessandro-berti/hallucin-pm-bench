10.0

The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth on all questions:

- Q1: "3" (correct)
- Q2: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" (correct, order and activity names are perfect)
- Q3: Two distinct, alphabetically ordered activities: "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock", listed one per line (precisely as expected). The LLM briefly explains reasoning, but the explicit answer matches the ground truth in content and format.

There are no errors, omissions, or hallucinations. The answer warrants a perfect score: 10.0.
