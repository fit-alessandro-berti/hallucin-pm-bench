The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth across all questions with no missing, extra, or fabricated elements in the core responses:
- Q1: Exact match (3).
- Q2: Exact sequence match, including order and separator.
- Q3: Exact content match (distinct activities: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), alphabetically ordered, one per line. Minor format variance (no leading dashes, but equivalent structure) does not constitute an error given the content precision. Explanatory text is accurate and supplementary, not hallucinatory.
