The LLM answer is fully accurate and aligns perfectly with the ground truth. Questions 1 and 2 (a/b) match exactly in values, calculations, and formatting (e.g., rounding to two decimals, percentages). For question 3, the response is concise (85 words <100), directly addresses the single occurrence (i), highlights instability via low frequency preventing reliable patterns (ii), and cautions against generalization by noting risks to models, metrics, and predictions (iii). No errors, inventions, or deviations; it adheres strictly to the log data.
