7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
**Part (a) - Decision Points (8.5/10):**  
- Correctly identifies both decision points (the conditional skip and TriVote gate).  
- Rules accurately summarized in one sentence each, matching core logic (Low/Medium risk + amount ≤ €250k skips step 5; ≥2/3 approvals to pass).  
- Minor deductions:  
  - Formatting differences (e.g., "€250,000 or less" vs. ground truth's "≤ €250 000"; no bolding/quotes on "Approve"; step labels like "Step 4 Conditional Branch" vs. descriptive titles like "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check").  
  - Slight rephrasing ("proceeds to the offer stage" vs. explicit "bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise proceeds"). These are small but penalized per strictness rule.

**Part (b) - Documents List (6.0/10):**  
- Correctly lists 8/9 documents in proper first-appearance order (Form 14B → scorecards → Deck Memo → Offer Sheet 77 → ID Matrix Declaration → Loan Dossier 2025).  
- No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions).  
- Major deduction: **Omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77"** (explicitly listed in step 8 as a distinct document post step 7's "Offer Sheet 77"). This makes the list incomplete ("ALL documents"), violating the prompt.  
- Minor deductions: Adds unnecessary "(Step X)" annotations (absent in ground truth); list numbering/style differs slightly.

**Overall (weighted average, strict):** 7.2/10. Strong on content accuracy and structure, but omission of one required document + phrasing/formatting variances = significant point loss (not minor). No perfect match to ground truth.
