The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without forbidden variants and introduces no extra content, tasks, or roles, earning partial credit for adherence to the vocabulary policy and structural basics. However, the RACI assignments deviate significantly from the ground truth in multiple cells across most activities (e.g., incorrect Accountable/Consulted/Informed roles for Receive Application, KYC Review, Payment Clearance, Record Update, and Notify Customer; mishandling of split R/A vs. combined R/A), failing to accurately reflect the narrative's implied responsibilities and accountabilities. The non-tabular format also poorly represents the specified "matrix (activities as rows, roles as columns)" structure, despite being list-like. These factual and formatting errors, even if minor individually, compound to indicate substantial inaccuracies under strict evaluation criteria.
