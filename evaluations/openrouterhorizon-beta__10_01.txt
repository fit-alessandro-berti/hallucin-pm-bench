7.0

The LLM answer adheres to the strict vocabulary requirements: it uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance", and never mentions the forbidden terms.

However, points are lost for the following reasons:

- **Assignment inaccuracies:**
  - *KYC Review* assigns "R/A" to Compliance Officer and "I" to Account Manager. The ground truth correctly gives CO as R, AM as A (not I), and FC as C. The answer collapses R and A into one cell, losing the separation of duties.
  - *Order Vetting* gives "R/A" to Account Manager (matching ground truth), but assigns "C" to CO rather than "I", and "I" to FC instead of I (matches), but merges R/A into one, instead of R and A in separate columns.
  - *Payment Clearance* gives "R/A" to Finance Clerk, when ground truth separates R (FC) and A (AM). CO is "I" instead of C, AM is "C" instead of A. Again, a collapse of R/A into one column.
  - *Record Update* assigns "R/A" to IT Support; ground truth shows only R for IT and I for CO (the answer gives everyone else "I", losing the C to both AM and FC).
  - *Notify Customer* gives "R/A" to AM but "C" to IT, while ground truth assigns only AM as R/A, all others as I.

- **RACI format issues:** The answer merges R and A into cells ("R/A") instead of strictly assigning distinct R and A according to ground truth. The matrix grants only one R/A per task, blending the two responsibilities into one when they're distinct, as highlighted by ground truth.

- **Consulting conventions:** "C" (consulted) and "I" (informed) assignments sometimes disagree (see "Record Update" and "KYC Review") with ground truth.

**Strengths:**
- Strict terminology compliance.
- No use or mention of forbidden terms.
- No extraneous activities or roles.

**Conclusion:** The answer is structurally close and obeys the strictest vocabulary rules, but due to the consistent collapsing of R/A, multiple misassignments of C and I, and a slight deviation in RACI discipline, the answer cannot score above a 7.0. Each individual cell infidelity is a significant error per the instruction.
