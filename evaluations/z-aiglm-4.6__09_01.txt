The LLM answer accurately identifies that the average cycle time cannot be derived due to the absence of time-based data, directly aligning with the system instruction and ground truth. The explanation is concise, correct, and addresses both the query's components (stating the impossibility for part 1 and providing reasoning for part 2), with no factual errors, fabrications, or deviations from the core conclusion. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; omission of "ordering information") do not impact the substantive correctness under strict evaluation.
