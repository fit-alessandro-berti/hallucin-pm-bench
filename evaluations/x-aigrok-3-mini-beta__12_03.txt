The LLM answer is highly accurate, both in the main answer ("No") and in the reasoning. It:

- Correctly identifies that the FACT is false because the "always immediately after" condition does not hold for all cases.
- Explicitly cites and describes the relevant CaseIDs and their sequences, specifically pointing out that C002 and C004 feature intervening activities.
- Clearly states, with activity sequences, what comes after "Receive_Order" in all relevant cases.
- Provides a brief summary affirming the FACT is contradicted by C002 and C004.

**Difference from Ground Truth:**
The ground truth is stricter and includes a formatted, case-by-case table specifying the activity sequences and immediate successor status, along with concise notes. This increases clarity and makes the answer fully exhaustive and exceptionally clear.

**What is missing or less optimal in the LLM answer:**
- It does not include a tabular or directly structured side-by-side overview of all cases.
- Its format is slightly less explicit compared to the systematic assessment in the ground truth.
- It doesn't clearly mark which cases are compliant/non-compliant as a checklist or table.

**Conclusion:**  
The LLM answer is factually complete and specific, with only a slight shortfall in formatting and thoroughness relative to the ground truth. This warrants a minor point deduction for completeness and rigor in presentation, but not for content accuracy.
