### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) (Decision Points)**: The LLM correctly identifies and summarizes both decision points with accurate rules, closely mirroring the ground truth in content and structure (e.g., conditional skip logic and TriVote rule). Minor deductions for slightly verbose phrasing (e.g., "at least any two" is redundant/awkward vs. ground truth's concise "at least two"), explicit step references not in ground truth, and introductory sentence not present in ground truth. Score: 9.0/10.
- **Part b) (Documents List)**: Strong on completeness for most items, order, and no hallucinations (e.g., correctly avoids KYC/AML mentions). However, significant error in not treating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document entry first appearing in step 8 (ground truth lists it separately as item 7, reflecting the process's explicit mention of the signed version as required in step 8, separate from the unsigned preparation in step 7). This results in an incomplete list (8 items vs. ground truth's 9) and omits a key nuance. Additional minor deductions for bold formatting, parenthetical explanations, and "unique documents" qualifier not in ground truth, which alter the plain-list format. Score: 5.5/10.
- **Overall**: Weighted average reflects high fidelity in a) but strict penalty for the substantive omission and formatting deviations in b), per instructions for utmost strictness on differences (even subtle content gaps like distinct document mentions). No other major issues (e.g., no extraneous content or misinterpretations).
