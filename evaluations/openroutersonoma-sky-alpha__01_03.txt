7.5

The LLM answer is very close but contains some deviations and minor omissions compared to the ground truth; these should reflect in lost points according to the strict grading criteria:

a) **Decision Points**
- The LLM answer is accurate in phraseology and captures *both* decision points, and their logic is very well summarized.
- It explicitly mentions the positional context (“post-Tri-Color-Risk-Check” and “TriVote Decision Gate”), and the logic matches the ground truth closely.
- However, the ground truth briefly but more precisely encapsulates the “TriVote” as "at least two of the three approvers...record 'Approve,'" whereas the LLM says “any two out of three required approvals...are obtained.” This is a minor difference in wording but does not change the meaning substantially.

b) **Required Documents**
- The LLM correctly lists all documents and in the right order up to Offer Sheet 77.
- The LLM includes “ID Matrix Declaration” and “Loan Dossier 2025” appropriately.
- The LLM does *not* separately list "Signed Offer Sheet 77," instead just “Offer Sheet 77 (first appears in step 7; later signed in step 8).” However, the ground truth specifically calls out **"Signed Offer Sheet 77"** as a distinct required document when it first appears (step 8). This is a *notable* omission; the requirement is to list all documents as they first appear in required form, so treating "Offer Sheet 77" and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a single document is an error.
- The LLM does not hallucinate any documents.

**Summary of Deductions:**
- The answer omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document.
- Wording in decision gates is slightly less precise but not substantively wrong.
- All major process logic is preserved and no hallucinated steps or documents are present.

**Final score:** 7.5.  
Loss of 2–2.5 points for (i) missing a required document and (ii) not strictly following the document differentiation as required, per the strict standard.
