**10.0**

The LLM answer is a near-perfect match to the ground truth across all questions, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the 18 log lines, or factual errors. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "1 time" vs. "`1` occurrence"; detailed but accurate explanations in Q4 matching "small sample size" and "temporal bias") do not constitute deviations under strict evaluation, as content, calculations, and reasoning align precisely. Q4 provides two clearly stated, valid sampling-related reasons directly from the ideal set.
