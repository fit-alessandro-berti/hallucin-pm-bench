7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities as the ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), which aligns well with key table metrics like wait times (150/30/18 min), processing times (5/25/12 min), rework rates (22%/5.3%/1.8%), and SLA breaches (5.5%/12.4%/3.2%), showing no hallucination or inclusion of absent activities. The memo is concise (under 200 words) and sticks to table data without guessing on unclear differentiations.

However, strict deduction is applied for incompleteness and precision gaps:
- **Explanations**: Omits critical metrics, reducing depth. For Request_Documents, misses throughput drop to 190 cases/day (a key "why" factor in ground truth). For Review_Documents, ignores 30-min wait and 12.4% SLA breach (the activity's worst aspects; focuses on moderate 5.3% rework instead). For Initial_Assessment, skips 12-min processing time and downstream congestion impact.
- **Recommendations**: Less concrete and data-driven than ground truth. Request_Documents rec is vague on validation or rework reduction targets. Review_Documents rec (training) lacks specificity (e.g., no AI or squad metrics). Initial_Assessment rec (resources) is generic, missing targeted automation like triage.
- **Structure/Overall**: No projected impacts (e.g., throughput/SLA gains) or bottleneck interlinks, making it less executive-level insightful. Minor phrasing is professional but lacks ground truth's bolding and precision.

These omissions (missing ~30% of key explanatory metrics) and weaker actionability warrant a mid-high score but significant loss from 10.0 for not fully matching factual rigor and data-driven depth.
