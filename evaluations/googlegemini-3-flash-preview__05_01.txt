**4.0**

Major flaws vs. ground truth: specifies *non-interrupting* timer (wrong; must be *interrupting* to bypass properly, else parallel execution fails SLA enforcement). Attaches primarily to **Task_Check** (not **Task_Receive**). Vaguely suggests "Escalation Boundary Event" (incorrect; escalation ≠ timer). Lacks event ID ("Timer_48h"), XML `<timeDuration>PT48H</timeDuration>`, precise bypassing explanation for doc requests. References flows unnecessarily. Core idea similar but inaccurate details prevent correct BPMN implementation—significant deductions for strict criteria.
