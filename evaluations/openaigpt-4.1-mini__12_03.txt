The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides an accurate, case-by-case justification that matches the ground truth in content, including all relevant sequences, violations (C002 and C004), and supports (C001 and C003), while clearly explaining why the "always" claim fails. Minor differences in format (narrative bullets vs. table) and phrasing (e.g., including extra post-Validate_Payment activities in sequences, like Pack_Items, which are accurate but not essential; "multiple cases" vs. explicitly "two out of four") prevent a perfect score under strict evaluation, but these do not introduce errors or omissions.
