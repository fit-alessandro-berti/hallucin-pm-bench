The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" to Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) as in the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3. The concise reason accurately explains the enabling of T5 via the P1 branch while leaving the P2 token for later consumption by T5, mirroring the ground truth's logic without errors. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., no explicit markings) do not detract from correctness or completeness under the 120-word limit.
