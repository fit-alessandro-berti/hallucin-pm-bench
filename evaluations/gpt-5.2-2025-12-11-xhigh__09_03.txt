The LLM answer is nearly identical in substance, structure (one short explanatory paragraph), and precision to the ground truth: both correctly identify the absence of event rows and timestamps (explicitly naming start_time/complete_time) in Artefact A as the core reason no metrics (mean cycle time, SD, 95% CI) can be computed, without guessing. Minor deductions for: (1) slight rephrasing ("I cannot compute... because" vs. "Impossible — the necessary data are absent"), (2) added detail on Artefact B's irrelevance (accurate and relevant but absent in ground truth, introducing non-identical content), and (3) omission of ground truth's closing "Additional raw log entries are required" (though not required by task). No factual errors or violations of instructions.
