The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format with one pair per line in a code block. However, it includes an unnecessary introductory sentence, lacks the ground truth's explanatory rationale section (which provides justification for the pairs), and has minor spacing inconsistencies in the second pair (fewer padding spaces before the em dash compared to the ground truth's aligned formatting). These deviations from the exact structure and content of the ground truth warrant a deduction, but the core response is accurate and complete.
