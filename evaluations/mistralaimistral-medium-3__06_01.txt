9.2

The LLM answer is correct (it lists the only two pairs that can be executed in parallel in Process B and ignores Process A), and its alphabetical ordering within the lines and overall is sound. However, there is one small formatting issue:

- The ground truth aligns the two pairs at the "â€”" for maximum clarity (using spaces to pad), while the LLM answer does not; this is a **formatting discrepancy**.

As you instruction says to be "utmost strict" and to penalize even small errors, this is a small but real deduction. No factual/content errors are present.

Therefore, a 9.2 is assigned: very high, but penalized for alignment format.
