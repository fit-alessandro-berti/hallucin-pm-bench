The LLM answer correctly states "No" in direct response to the prompt, and provides specific evidence by referring to cases C002 and C003 with supporting line numbers.

However, it does not mention case C005, which is a critical counterexample present in the ground truth answer: C005 features a *Validate_Payment* event without any preceding *Receive_Order* event in the case. This omission is significant since it means the LLM missed one of the strongest pieces of disconfirming evidence.

Additionally, while the LLM notes that in C002 an intervening *Check_Inventory* event occurs, this is less relevant than the fact that C003 and C005 directly violate the "always follows" claim in a more substantial way (by showing a reversed order or no *Receive_Order* at all).

The LLM answer does cite line numbers/case-ids, but not as clearly or exhaustively as the ground truth. Therefore, although the main point is correctly argued, the answer is incomplete and misses a crucial caseâ€”resulting in a substantial deduction.
