The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall conclusion as "No" and accurately highlights the counterexample in case C003 (Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order), which aligns with the ground truth. However, it introduces a significant error by incorrectly claiming case C002 as a counterexample, stating that Validate_Payment "does not follow" Receive_Order due to the intervening Check_Inventory (lines 3â€“5); in reality, Validate_Payment still follows Receive_Order in sequence, so this misinterpretation invalidates part of the justification and demonstrates a flawed understanding of "follows" as not requiring immediacy. Additionally, it completely omits the clear counterexample in case C005 (line 11), where Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order at all, which the ground truth explicitly cites as proof against "always." These omissions and inaccuracies in the justification paragraph result in substantial deviation from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria.
