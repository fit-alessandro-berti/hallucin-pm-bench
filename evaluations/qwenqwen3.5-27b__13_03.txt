**7.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Part 1 (Exact Count)**: Perfect match ("1"). No loss. (+5/5)
- **Part 2 (Explanation, ≤120 words)**: Core idea of small sample bias (3 cases, ~2 hours, insufficient for extrapolation) is covered well (~85 words). Mentions sampling bias effectively. However, **significant omissions** vs. ground truth deduct heavily:
  - No quantification of volatility (e.g., 0% to 7% swing, wide confidence interval, extreme sampling error for rare events).
  - No discussion of near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and strict vs. fuzzy matching risks—key to misestimation.
  - Lacks specifics like 14 events or precise case/time reference.
  - Ground truth's statistical depth (rare event error) is diluted to generic "statistically insufficient."
  
These gaps mean incomplete fidelity to ground truth's nuance, justifying ~30% loss despite strong structure. Total: +5/5 (P1) + 2/5 (P2) = 7.0.
