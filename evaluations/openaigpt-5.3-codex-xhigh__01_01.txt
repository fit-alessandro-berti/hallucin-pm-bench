**6.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision points (major differences, -2.5 points)**: LLM identifies 4 points vs. GT's precise 3. Introduces non-standard "Payment gate" (#4) framing **Process_Refund_Payment** as a decision (with conditions), absent in GT; GT consolidates approvals into #3 ("Final payment approval"). LLM #1/#2 lack explicit branching/rejection outcomes (e.g., "Not eligible → rejected"; "Approved/Rejected"); only #3 has partial branching. GT table specifies exact logic/phrasing/locations (e.g., "#2 *Amount threshold* **after** **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**"); LLM rephrases loosely (e.g., "#2 Finance pre-approval" without reject path). Misses GT #3's explicit "process ends without payment."
- **Required documents (minor differences, -0.5 points)**: Lists all 7 correctly, matching process. Notes similar (high-value for **AuditTrail**; signed for **BankTransferAuthorization**), but unnumbered bullets vs. GT's numbered list; lacks GT's "*part of the catalogue*" qualifier and closing note "(No other documents... )".
- **Structure/fidelity (minor, -0.3 points)**: Markdown lists vs. GT table; headings unnecessary/excessive. No introduced extras (good), but paraphrasing deviates from GT's verbatim style (e.g., €1 000 vs. €1,000; no italics consistency).
- **Overall strictness**: Content ~70% aligned (core facts present), but structural/content diffs in core "decision points" (prompt focus) warrant sharp deduction; no fatal errors but multiple small ones compound. Base 10 → deductions = 6.2.
