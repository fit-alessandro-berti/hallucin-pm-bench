**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1 (says "No" instead of "Yes"), provides no valid sequence for Q2, and its explanation misinterprets the net's parallelism (ignores the P1-P3-P7-T4 path marking P5 while leaving P2 available for T5). This is a complete reversal of the ground truth, warranting the minimum score under strict criteria.
