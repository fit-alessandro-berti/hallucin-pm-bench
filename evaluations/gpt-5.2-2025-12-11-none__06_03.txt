9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Content Accuracy (perfect, full points)**: Identifies exactly the two correct sets of concurrent tasks from Process B (`Quality_Check` & `Update_Inventory`; `Generate_Replenishment_Report` & `Notify_Procurement`), in correct order. No mention of A or C. No hallucinations or extras.
- **Structure/Completeness (minor deductions)**: Numbered sets correctly as instructed. Implies completeness by listing only these (matches intent), but lacks explicit "No other tasks..." confirmation (-0.3).
- **Formatting/Phrasing (significant deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Headers differ: "Parallel Split #1" (exact process match) vs. "Set 1 – first parallel block" (-0.3).
  - Listing style: Bullets vs. inline `task` ‖ `task` with backticks (-0.2).
- Total: Extremely close semantically (would be 10.0 in lenient eval), but strict format/phrasing diffs warrant ~0.8 loss per instructions.
