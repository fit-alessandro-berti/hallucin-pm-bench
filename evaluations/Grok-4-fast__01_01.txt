### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, Significant Deduction)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 decision points in a concise table format, focusing on eligibility check (#1), amount threshold branching (#2), and consolidated final approval at pre-approval/auditor review (#3). The LLM answer incorrectly expands this to 4 points, introducing an unsubstantiated "Payment Readiness Check" as a distinct decision (verifying conditions and *BankTransferAuthorization*), which is not a defined decision point in the process description but merely a constraint. This violates the prompt's instruction to "not introduce any activities or artefacts that are not defined above." Additionally, the LLM separates pre-approval into its own decision (#2 in LLM), misaligning with the ground truth's consolidation in #3, and uses a narrative summary instead of a structured table. While the core branching logic (eligibility and high-value) is mostly accurate, the additions and restructuring introduce clear differences, warranting a heavy penalty under strict evaluation (e.g., ~40% deduction for invention and misalignment).
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors, Moderate Deduction)**: The list matches the ground truth's 7 documents exactly, with no introductions of undefined items. However, the LLM adds unrequested "Purpose/Usage" details (e.g., explaining where each is used), which bloats the response beyond a simple list. It also fails to explicitly note the conditional nature of *AuditTrail* (only for >â‚¬1,000) in the table itself (though mentioned elsewhere), unlike the ground truth's precise caveat. The table format is acceptable but deviates from the ground truth's numbered list, and the LLM omits the ground truth's closing note reinforcing "no other documents or legacy activities," which ties back to the prompt's constraints. These are small but reflect in point loss per instructions (~20% deduction).

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor Issues)**: The response is well-organized but unnecessarily verbose and interpretive, straying from the ground truth's succinct, tabular/numbered style. No legacy activities are introduced (positive), but the net differences in decision points dominate, resulting in partial credit only for covering the essentials. Strict scoring penalizes all deviations proportionally.
