The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match the deterministic calculations and formatting (2.08% and 8.33%, with correct rounding to two decimals). Question 3 is within 100 words (78 words), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue (explicitly noted), highlights variance/instability (e.g., "lack reliability," "skew analysis," "overfit or ignore," "misleading patterns"), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "generalized assumptions that fail in edge cases," tying to underrepresented critical exceptions). It aligns closely with the ground truth requirements without errors, inventions, or deviations, while staying grounded in the log data.
