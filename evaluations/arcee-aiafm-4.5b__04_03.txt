2.5

The LLM answer reaches the correct final conclusion ("No") by coincidence but contains major errors in its step-by-step justification, directly contradicting the ground truth on three out of four rules: it incorrectly violates Rule 2 (states VP before QE/RA despite the trace showing VP after both), incorrectly satisfies Rule 3 (ignores that NA precedes RA), and incorrectly flags Rule 4 as unresolved (when CC follows both NA and VP as required). Only Rule 1 is accurately assessed. The contradictory phrasing in Rule 2 ("QE and RA occur before VP" followed by "violated because VP happens before") further undermines credibility. Under strict evaluation criteria, these substantive differences warrant a low score despite the matching overall verdict.
