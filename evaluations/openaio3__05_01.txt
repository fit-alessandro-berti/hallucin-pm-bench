1.5

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in critical ways, warranting a near-minimal score under strict evaluation. Key errors include: (1) Incorrect timer attachment to Task_RequestDocs (instead of Task_Receive), which fails to measure from claim submission and only activates for incomplete docs, potentially violating the 48-hour SLA from start; (2) Timer outcome ends the process via a new escalation end event (violating "must reach Triage Claim" by not advancing to Task_Triage), rather than bypassing to Task_Triage; (3) Introduces an unnecessary new end event, while ground truth reuses existing elements with just a timer and flow. These flaws misalign with SLA intent and prompt constraints, though it correctly avoids new tasks and stays concise.
