9.2

**Evaluation rationale (strict assessment):**
- **Correctness (full points):** Q1 "Yes" matches. Sequence identical (T1,T2,T7,T4,T5). Explanation accurately describes alternative path preserving P2 token, T3's disabling effect if fired. No factual errors.
- **Deductions (-0.8 total):**
  - Missing explicit markings (M₁={P1,P2}, etc.) for sequence verification (-0.4; ground truth provides for precision).
  - Explanation structure differs: LLM separates sequence then general explanation; ground truth integrates path explanation in Q1, detailed numbered list + post-T5 disabling note in Q2 (-0.2).
  - Minor phrasing variances (e.g., LLM "P1 → P3 → P4" vs. ground truth full sequence arrows; no "subsequently disabled" confirmation) (-0.2).
- Under 120 words, complete, but stylistic/presentation diffs warrant strict penalty per instructions.
