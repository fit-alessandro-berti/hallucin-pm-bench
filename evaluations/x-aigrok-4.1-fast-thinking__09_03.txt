The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in identifying the precise reason for impossibility (redacted rows and timestamps in Artefact A, no data for "Approve Invoice" cycle times), covers all required metrics (average, std dev, 95% CI), explicitly dismisses Artefact B without using it, explains cycle time computation accurately from columns without guessing, and adheres to "one short paragraph" in plain text. No errors, deviations, or additions beyond the given information.
