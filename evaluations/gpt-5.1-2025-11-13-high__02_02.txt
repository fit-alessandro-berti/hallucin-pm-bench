10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content across all three questions: correct count for Q1, identical sequence for Q2 (including activity names and order), and precise list for Q3 (alphabetically ordered with matching items and formatting). Minor stylistic additions (e.g., explanatory phrases, bolding, backticks) do not introduce errors, fabrications, or omissions, so no deductions apply under strict evaluation.
