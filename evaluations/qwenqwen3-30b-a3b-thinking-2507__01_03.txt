3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Part (a): Summary of Decision Points
- **Strengths**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two primary decision points (the risk-based skip in Step 4 and the TriVote gate in Step 6) in one sentence each, aligning closely with the ground truth's wording and logic (e.g., "Low or Medium *and* ≤ €250,000" for the skip; "at least two of the three" for TriVote). The note correctly acknowledges no other branches exist and references the absence of KYC/AML.
- **Errors and Differences**:
  - Introduces a third "decision point" (the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome itself), which is not a gate or conditional branch per the prompt—it's merely Step 3, an input-generating step. The ground truth omits this entirely, treating it as non-decisional, making this a clear hallucination/invention.
  - Minor phrasing issues: The skip description adds "only if" (implying exclusivity not emphasized in ground truth); TriVote says "provide approval" vs. ground truth's precise "record 'Approve.'" These are small but, per instructions, warrant significant deduction under utmost strictness.
- **Impact**: One accurate core point but an extraneous one dilutes completeness; minor wording variances compound the issue. Partial credit for the correct ones, but strict penalty for addition and imprecision → ~5.0/10 for this part.

#### Part (b): List of Documents
- **Strengths**: Correctly lists Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, and Loan Dossier 2025 in proper first-appearance order. The note correctly clarifies that "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is not a *new* document, avoiding duplication.
- **Errors and Differences**:
  - **Major omission**: Completely misses the three Scorecard documents (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow), which are explicit inputs/requirements in Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) and thus appear before Deck Memo. Ground truth lists them as items 2–4, making this a critical gap— these are "required anywhere in the process" per the prompt.
  - **Incomplete handling of Step 8**: Lists only ID Matrix Declaration but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document in Step 8 (ground truth treats it as separate, item 7, since it's the signed version first appearing there). The LLM's note dismisses it as non-new, but the process specifies it explicitly in Step 8, so this is an under-listing.
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions), but the list is incomplete (5 items vs. ground truth's 9), violating "all documents... in the order they first appear."
- **Impact**: Omitting 4/9 items (3 scorecards + Signed version) is a severe failure of completeness; order of listed items is correct, but gaps are indefensible under strict evaluation → ~2.0/10 for this part.

#### Overall Score Calculation
- Weighted average (equal parts): (5.0 + 2.0)/2 = 3.5. Strictness applied: Even partial accuracies can't offset major omissions/inventions; differences are substantive, not minor, leading to significant point loss as instructed. The LLM shows understanding but fails on exhaustiveness and precision.
