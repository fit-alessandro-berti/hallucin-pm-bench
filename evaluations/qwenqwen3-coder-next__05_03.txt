**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major flaws (severe deductions)**: LLM uses invalid BPMN (intermediateCatchEvent with `timerDelay` placed *sequentially after* `Activity_CreateAccount`, which starts the timer **post-task completion**—failing to measure/enforce the required 48h *duration of the task itself* from after "Verify Identity"; CatchEvent is semantically wrong for delays, should be ThrowingEvent or Boundary; multiple outgoing flows without gateway violates BPMN flow rules).
- **SLA misalignment**: Does not correctly time from end of "Verify Identity" (boundary on task starts ~correctly at task start post-gateway; LLM delays enforcement).
- **Extra invalid elements**: Unnecessary `Flow_11` to `End_Success` creates invalid split; justification falsely claims "proceed without delay if on time" (sequential timer would block post-task).
- **Minor credits (+partial points)**: Correctly identifies/reuses existing `Activity_AMReview`; approximates 48h (`P2D` ≈ `PT48H`); no new activities; one-sentence format.
- **Overall**: Fundamentally non-functional solution vs. ground truth's precise, valid interrupting boundary timer—equivalent to ~80% point loss for core functional/BPMN errors.
