The LLM answer incorrectly answers Question 1 as "No," directly contradicting the ground truth's "Yes." It fails to recognize the alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) that enables T5 to fire using the P2 token without T3, misstating prerequisites for P4 and P5. The explanation for Question 2 is invalid, providing a flawed rationale instead of the required sequence. This fundamental error on the core question, with no accurate insight, warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation.
