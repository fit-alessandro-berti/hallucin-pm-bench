8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all the functional differences and does not add any extraneous information or commentary. However, it does not strictly follow the formatting of the ground truth in two notable ways:

- It omits the leading dash "–" for each entry, which is present in the ground truth under every heading.
- For the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section, it omits the alignment in the second gateway (`Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel` in ground truth), and does not include the leading dash.

While these errors do not affect the content, they do represent clear deviations from the explicit requested output, particularly the verbatim grouping and format. As per the instruction to be strict and penalize even small errors, a deduction of 2.0 points is warranted.
