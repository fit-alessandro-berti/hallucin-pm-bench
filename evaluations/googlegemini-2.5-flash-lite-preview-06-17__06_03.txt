The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of tasks that can execute concurrently in Process B and numbers them in the correct order. However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer omits the extra explanatory labeling (“first parallel block,” “second parallel block”) and formatting (use of backticks, em-dash, explanatory note about no other tasks running in parallel). Although the essential content is accurate, the lack of explicit labeling and clarifying note (as in the ground truth) constitutes a small but notable omission, so a full score is not warranted.
