The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two concurrent task sets from Process B in the exact order they appear, with no extraneous information about other processes or incorrect tasks. Substance is fully accurate and complete per the prompt. Minor deductions for formatting differences (e.g., commas instead of ‖ symbols, lack of descriptive labels like "Set 1 – first parallel block:", no backticks around task names, and absence of the closing sentence in the ground truth), which under strict evaluation reflect small but notable stylistic variances from the ground truth.
