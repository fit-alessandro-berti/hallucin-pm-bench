The LLM answer accurately identifies all required changes under the exact headings, matching the core content of the ground truth: three added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), one removed task (Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change (Exclusive to Inclusive for Gateway_Decision). It ignores irrelevant details like renamings (e.g., task names, gateway name) as instructed.

Minor deductions (0.5 points) for:
- Formatting differences: Uses bullets instead of numbered lists; lists ID before name (reversed from ground truth's name bold + `ID` format); plain headings vs. bolded.
- Slightly less detail in gateway description: Omits (XOR) and (OR) abbreviations, v1/v2 references, and the closing note "(No other... present)", though these are not explicitly required by the prompt and the core summary follows the example phrasing ("Exclusive â†’ Inclusive"). 

No content errors or omissions; evaluation is strict but recognizes near-perfect alignment on substance.
