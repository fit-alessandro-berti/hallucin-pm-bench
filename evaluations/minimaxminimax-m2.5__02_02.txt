9.5

**Evaluation Rationale (strict line-by-line comparison):**

- **Q1/A1**: LLM correctly states "3" but adds unnecessary "(C001, C002, C003)" and echoes "distinct cases". Ground truth is minimally "**3**". Extra correct details = minor deviation (-0.5 points).
- **Q2/A2**: Exact factual match in sequence and order. Ground truth escapes (`\_`) are rendering artifacts, not content differences. Perfect (full points).
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), correctly one per line and alphabetically ordered. Ground truth adds "-" bullets and "<br>" (not required by prompt). Perfect (full points).

Overall: Factually flawless (no hallucinations/missing/extra fabricated elements), minor formatting/verbosity difference in Q1 only. Deduction reflects utmost strictness on exactness to ground truth structure.
