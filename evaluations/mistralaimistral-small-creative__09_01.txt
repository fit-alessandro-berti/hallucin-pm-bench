The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in core content, structure, and intent: both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed due to absent timestamps/durations, explain the data limitation precisely, and adhere to the system policy against fabricating values. Minor deductions (-0.2) for slight phrasing differences ("derived" vs. "computed"; added benchmark clarification, which is accurate but extraneous to ground truth; minor imprecision in cycle time definition with "or the time between consecutive activities," potentially conflating activity processing time with inter-activity flow time). No factual errors, fully responsive to both prompt questions.
