**8.0**

Q1-Q4 match the ground truth exactly (perfect). Q5 has two correct activities ("Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") but incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which is the first event in case C-77) and omits "Validate_Order" (which never starts a case). This is a significant factual error in identifying first events per case (requiring timestamp sorting per case ID), despite the instruction allowing unsorted lists. Under utmost strictness, this warrants a 2-point deduction from a perfect 10.0 for the mismatched list content. The JSON schema is otherwise perfectly followed.
