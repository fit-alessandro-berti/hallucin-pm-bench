The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" as the response, aligning with the ground truth, and provides a one-paragraph justification that accurately cites the key counterexamples (C003 with lines 6 and 7 showing Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order, and C005 with line 11 lacking any Receive_Order). It matches the ground truth's core reasoning on violations of the "always follows" claim without introducing factual errors. Minor deductions for including unnecessary details on compliant cases (C001, C002, C004), which are not in the ground truth and slightly exceed the concise focus on counterexamples, and for phrasing "without any preceding" instead of the ground truth's "never contains at all," a subtle but non-equivalent wording under strict evaluation.
