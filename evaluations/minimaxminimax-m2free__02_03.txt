- **Evaluation Notes**: The LLM answer is semantically accurate on all three questions, correctly identifying 3 distinct cases, "Pack_Items" as the predecessor for C456's Ship_Order (upon chronological sorting of events for that case: Create_Order at 09:10, Validate_Order at 09:20, Pack_Items at 09:35, Ship_Order at 09:40), and Cancel_Order as the unique activity (appears once; others: Create_Order x3, Validate_Order x2, Pack_Items x2, Ship_Order x2). However, it deducts points for minor differences from ground truth: slight verbosity/restating of questions (e.g., full phrasing for Q2 instead of minimal "Pack_Items"), inconsistent bolding/formatting, and use of "-" bullets vs. "*" in ground truth. These are small but, per strict criteria, warrant a deduction from perfect.
