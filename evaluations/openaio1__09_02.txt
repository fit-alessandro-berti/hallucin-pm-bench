The LLM answer is concise and correctly identifies the core issue (lack of time-based data), aligning well with the prompt's requirements and the ground truth's intent. However, it deducts a full point for minor phrasing differences: it uses "cannot be determined" instead of "impossible to compute," omits explicit reference to "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals," and lacks the ground truth's precise structure tying the explanation directly to the calculation impossibilityâ€”small omissions that reduce specificity under strict evaluation.
