The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on Q1 and Q3 (correct distinct cases and earliest timestamp). However, it has significant errors on the remaining questions: Q2 incorrectly identifies the preceding activity as "Validate_Order" instead of "Pack_Items" (failing to sequence events for case A-9321 properly); Q4 overcounts "Quality_Check" occurrences as 3 instead of 2 (only events for B-1045 and C-77 exist); and Q5 provides an incomplete and inaccurate list, including only "Pack_Items" while omitting "Validate_Order" and "Ship_Order" (misidentifying activities that never start cases). Under utmost strictness, these three errors—two completely wrong and one with a small but critical numerical inaccuracy—result in substantial deductions despite the two correct fields.
