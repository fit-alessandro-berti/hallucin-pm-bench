9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies "YES" and provides a valid, minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, with a brief justification tied to the inhibitor arc and zero tokens in p4. This directly addresses the prompt's requirements without errors in logic or reachability.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Minor notation inconsistencies (significant point deduction per instructions)**: Markings use informal set notation (e.g., {p1, p2}) instead of precise token counts (e.g., p1=1, p2=1), and initial marking omits explicit zeros for other places. This deviates from standard Petri net formalism seen in the ground truth.
- **Incomplete depth**: The justification is brief but omits the ground truth's key insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 (due to permanent disabling post-T3), and it does not extend the sequence to show post-T5 behavior (e.g., T3 firing afterward). While not required, these omissions create a less comprehensive match.
- **Superfluous framing**: Adds role-playing phrasing (e.g., "As the analyst... exception handling logic") not present in the ground truth, slightly diluting focus.

Overall, the core response is accurate and functional (90% alignment), but the small formal/precision gaps and lack of deeper proof warrant a 1.0 deduction from a perfect 10.0.
