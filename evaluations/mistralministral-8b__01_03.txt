### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) (Decision Points)**: Severe inaccuracies. The ground truth identifies exactly two conditional branches/gates: the risk-based skip (with precise rule: Low/Medium risk AND ≤ €250,000 to bypass step 5) and the TriVote (requiring at least two approvals). The LLM incorrectly treats nearly every sequential step as a "decision point" (e.g., listing Receive-Application, Assign-Deck-Reviewer, etc., which are not conditional branches), resulting in 9 inflated, non-qualifying items. While it captures the essence of the two real rules somewhat loosely (e.g., correct threshold and "any two" phrasing), the overall structure and identification are fundamentally wrong, with no one-sentence rules per actual point. This is a major deviation, warranting heavy deduction (worth ~40% of score).
  
- **Part b) (Documents)**: Major omissions and errors. The ground truth lists 9 documents in precise first-appearance order, explicitly including the three scorecards as inputs/documents in step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check). The LLM misses all three scorecards entirely, conflates "Offer Sheet 77" with its signed version (treating them as one), omits the signed variant as a separate requirement in step 8, and incorrectly adds a conditional note on Deck Memo (the query asks for all required documents in first-appearance order, without conditionals). It only partially captures the obvious ones (Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025), but the misses are critical and constitute ~50% of the list. No hallucinations of excluded items (e.g., KYC/AML), which avoids further penalty but doesn't compensate for the gaps (worth ~60% of score).

- **Overall**: The response shows some superficial understanding but fails core requirements through misinterpretation, incompleteness, and structural errors. Under utmost strictness, even partial matches (e.g., basic rule phrasing) yield minimal credit; small errors like the conditional qualifier and signed document merge compound to a low score.
