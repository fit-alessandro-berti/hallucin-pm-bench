3.5

**Assessment (a):**

- The LLM answer lists almost all process steps, not just actual decision points/gates or branches as requested, diluting and clouding the correct answer.
- Only two places in the process (Risk-based skip after risk check, and TriVote approval) are actual decision points, but the LLM's answer errors by treating non-decision steps as gates (e.g., Receive-Application, Assign-Deck-Reviewer, etc.).
- The LLM correctly describes the sense of both the risk-based branching (“If...then skip manual review”) and the TriVote (two of three to pass), but its branching rule wording isn’t as tightly precise as the ground truth.
- The answer incorrectly describes “Manual-Underwriting-Review” as a decision point; it is only reached via a prior decision.
- The LLM does NOT mention that the “Sustainability Officer” must always participate (this nuance is highly relevant per the prompt and ground truth).

**Assessment (b):**

- The LLM omits the Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow (ground truth #2, #3, #4), which are explicitly listed as required documents.
- It incorrectly lists “Signed Offer Sheet 77” as a required document only at the step of applicant confirmation, but does not mention it as distinct from Offer Sheet 77—whereas the ground truth distinguishes the signed version.
- It does include “Deck Memo”, “Offer Sheet 77”, “ID Matrix Declaration”, and “Loan Dossier 2025”.
- The order for “Signed Offer Sheet 77” and “ID Matrix Declaration” is reversed compared to ground truth, a small error.

**Strictness applied:**

- Severe penalties assessed for treating non-decision activities as “decision points”.
- Omission of three explicit required documents (Scorecards) is heavily penalized.
- The list in (a) fails to capture the precise rules and fails to highlight the necessity of “Sustainability Officer” participation.
- Minor ordering and naming imprecision lead to additional deduction.

Final score: **3.5 / 10** — The answer demonstrates partial but not robust understanding of decision logic, omits several required documents, and does not strictly differentiate between procedural steps and genuine decision points as specified.
