The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all three parallel blocks with exact task names and order matching the ground truth. However, it includes substantial extraneous reasoning text (e.g., step-by-step breakdown of the entire process, including sequential tasks) before the required numbered list, violating the prompt's instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" without additional content. This format deviation, though not altering the core accuracy, warrants a deduction under strict evaluation criteria for not adhering precisely to the specified output structure.
