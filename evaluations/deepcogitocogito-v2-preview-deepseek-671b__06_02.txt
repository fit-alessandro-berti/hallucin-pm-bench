The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in the enumeration of parallel task sets—three numbered lines, each listing the correct concurrent tasks per block, formatted precisely as instructed. The answer includes no extraneous tasks and does not mention other processes.

However, the answer contains a verbose introduction and reasoning; while accurate, this unnecessary elaboration is outside the direct instruction (“Return your answer as numbered lines; in each line list the tasks of one parallel block separated by commas”). The user asked for only the numbered list. Inclusion of explanatory text, even if correct, constitutes a deviation from the strict form requested and thus warrants a notable (but not catastrophic) penalty.

Otherwise, the answer is correct in substance, content, and order. 

Score deduction rationale:  
-0.5 for including a lengthy preamble and reasoning when the prompt requested *only* a numbered list.
-0.5 for not adhering strictly to the specified output format.

Final Score: **9.0**
