7.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision Points**
- The LLM correctly identifies the key decision points: the risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check and the TriVote gate.
- There is slight imprecision: it separately lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a decision point, but in the Acme process, this is an assessment step, not a gate—the actual branching/conditional happens just after, in step 4 (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} and amount ≤ €250k).
- The TriVote rule is accurately transcribed.

*Deduction:* Minor loss for calling "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" a decision point (overcounting compared to ground truth).

**b) Required Documents**
- The order of documents for steps 1–6 matches the process and ground truth.
- The LLM omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (which appears at the applicant confirmation step in ground truth), which is distinct from "Offer Sheet 77" that is prepared by the bank.
- All other required documents are present and in the correct order.

*Deduction:* Major issue is omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77." This is a substantive error as it means the response is missing one out of nine required documents.

**Other notes:**
- No hallucinations or mention of KYC/AML, as required.
- The language stays close to the source.

**Summary:**  
- The answer is mostly accurate and non-hallucinatory, but:
  - Overcounts decision points (mentions assessment as a gate).
  - Fails to list one required document ("Signed Offer Sheet 77").
- Per instructions, even small errors are penalized strictly, hence the markdown to 7.0.
