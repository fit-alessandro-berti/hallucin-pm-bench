### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (major errors, significant deduction):** The LLM incorrectly identifies the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a "decision point," but it is merely an assessment step that produces an input (risk rating) for the actual conditional branch; this adds an extraneous and inaccurate item, bloating the list beyond the two true decision points (the risk-based skip and TriVote). The skip condition is summarized adequately but omits the explicit "otherwise proceeds" clause for completeness, as in the ground truth. The TriVote summary is close but uses "provide approval" instead of the precise "record 'Approve'," and it paraphrases the rule without matching the ground truth's phrasing or structure (e.g., no numbering or exact "may advance only when" logic). Only partial credit for identifying the core rules, but the extras and incompleteness warrant a harsh penalty under strict criteria—effectively ~50% accurate.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents List (significant incompleteness, major deduction):** The list misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document that first appears in Step 8 (the process explicitly differentiates it from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in Step 7). This results in only 8/9 items, with the order otherwise correct but the core requirement violated by omission. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML inventions), which avoids further loss, but the gap is a clear failure to capture "all documents... in the order they first appear." Under strictness, this incomplete enumeration is a critical flaw—~80% accurate, but penalized heavily for the missing item.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity:** Minor positives for logical formatting and adherence to the process without external inventions, but the response diverges meaningfully from the ground truth's concise, precise structure (e.g., no unnecessary header or bullet styles that don't match). Total score reflects strict weighting: small errors (phrasing) compound with larger ones (extra/incorrect item in a, omission in b) to pull well below passing.
