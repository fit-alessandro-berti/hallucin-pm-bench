7.0

The LLM answer is reasonably strong regarding use of mandated terminology—it only uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" and never mentions forbidden terms. However, there are several non-trivial deviations from the ground truth:

1. **RACI role assignments are not fully accurate:**
   - The LLM answer often marks both "A, R" together for a single role and activity, which is acceptable if that's how the organization operates, but the ground truth provides clearer distinctions (e.g., often splitting A and R between roles where appropriate). In some cases, "A" is given to both Account Manager and Compliance Officer for steps where the ground truth gives only one role accountability.
   - The LLM leaves many cells blank in the matrix for consulted/informed, whereas the ground truth correctly applies C/I meaningfully to many more roles per activity.
   - For example, for "Receive Application", the ground truth marks Account Manager as R/A, but also assigns C, I, and I to the others; the LLM only lists roles if they're R, A, or I, so its answer lacks granularity.

2. **Missing or improper RACI designations:**
   - The LLM answer skips the input of C (Consulted) and I (Informed) for most activities and roles, whereas the ground truth is both thorough and correct.
   - This omission is a considerable flaw, as proper RACI matrices should indicate involvement across all roles.

3. **Minor table formatting differences:**
   - The LLM uses double entries (e.g., "A, R"), while the ground truth uses "R/A" — this is minor, but still a deviation.
   - The ground truth bolds certain entries to emphasize primary responsibilities, not done in the LLM answer.

4. **Extra/unwarranted content:**
   - The LLM adds a commentary and a legend not present in the ground truth—minor, but slightly extraneous.

**Summary:**  
- All mandated synonym rules are correctly followed; there is no use of forbidden terminology.  
- Key issue is that the RACI allocations to roles are incomplete and not as correct or detailed as required (lots of blank cells and failure to indicate C/I as expected), which is significant in an evaluation for process mapping.  
- There are only minor differences in formatting and presentation.

Due to these fairly significant lapses in correct RACI allocations (consulted/informed especially), the answer gets a major penalty. However, rock-solid vocabulary compliance and general structure earns it a passable (but not high) score: **7.0**.
