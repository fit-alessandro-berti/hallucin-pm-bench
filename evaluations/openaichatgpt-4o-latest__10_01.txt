The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exclusively, without any forbidden terms. The activity rows match the process description. However, the RACI assignments deviate substantially from the ground truth in nearly every cell: assignments are incomplete (many roles left blank where ground truth specifies C or I), some roles are incorrectly assigned (e.g., Account Manager as I instead of A for KYC Review and Payment Clearance; Finance Clerk as A/R instead of R for Payment Clearance; Account Manager as I instead of C for Record Update), and no activity has the full set of role involvements as in ground truth. Headers use unwarranted abbreviations not present in ground truth. Extra content (legend, introductory text, confirmatory note, and offer for additional formats) introduces unwarranted material. Each activity lacks exactly one Responsible in some interpretations, but overall allocations do not reflect the narrative as specified in the rubric. These errors are pervasive and core to the task, warranting a low score despite terminology accuracy.
