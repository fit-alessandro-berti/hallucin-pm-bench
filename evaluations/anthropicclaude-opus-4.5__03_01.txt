**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer captures the **correct process flow**, loop (gw3 "No" → t3), two primary decision points (gw1/gw2), and third implied one (gw3) **without hallucinations** (no timers, extra events/tasks/gateways—passes the trap). All 7 tasks + classification + start/end match semantically; no inventions. ≤40 lines, concise IDs, exclusive gateways used.

**However, utmost strictness demands near-exact match to ground truth; small differences incur significant deductions** (total -2.8 points):

- **Missing conditionExpressions (-1.5)**: Critical BPMN error. Exclusive gateways require `<conditionExpression xsi:type="tFormalExpression">yes/no</conditionExpression>` on outgoing flows for decisions (6 instances in ground truth). LLM uses informal `name="Yes"/"No"` labels (8 flows)—not executable logic, violates "exactly as stated" modeling.
- **Extra `xmlns:bpmndi` (-0.4)**: Direct violation ("No diagram/interchange elements required").
- **Task/gateway naming mismatches (-0.4)**: "Classify Ticket" ≠ "Auto-Classification" (prompt emphasizes "automatically"); gw2 "Can Resolve?" ≠ "Resolved Internally?".
- **Process/start/end attributes (-0.3)**: `isExecutable="true"` ≠ "false"; no `name="Support-Ticket"`; verbose start "Customer Submits Ticket" ≠ "Ticket Submitted"; different `targetNamespace`; no `<?xml declaration>`.
- **Minor structural (-0.2)**: Different IDs (ok per prompt) but flow formatting lacks ground truth precision.

Semantically ~95% accurate, but XML differences are numerous/line-by-line divergent → capped at 7.2. Perfect would be 10.0 (bit-for-bit).
