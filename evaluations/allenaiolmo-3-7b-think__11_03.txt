**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correct identification of top 3 activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment)**: Perfect match based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). +2.0 points.
- **Quantification of SLA exceedance**: Major error. Prompt requires "by how much each exceeds its SLA" (absolute difference, e.g., +300s as in GT). LLM uses ambiguous/inaccurate percentages ("150% SLA breach" misphrases 900s as 150% vs. 600s [+50% over]; "100%" for Risk inconsistent with 200%; "25%" ok but format mismatch). Omits explicit throughput times (900s, 600s, 300s). -3.0 points.
- **Recommendations**: Bullet points used correctly (only for recs). But not "data-driven": invents unsubstantiated metrics (~40%, 20% reductions; AI tools, parallel processing generic, no table grounding like cases/waiting). GT's are more concrete/tied (e.g., "add one risk analyst"). Completely different actions. -2.5 points.
- **Structure/content fidelity**: Memo-like (~130 words vs. ~150). Adds ungrounded claims ("customer satisfaction," "operational effectiveness," "critical bottlenecks" loosely ok but stretched). No invented activities/metrics beyond derivations, but phrasing/closing diverge (no To/From, total cases, projections like GT). Minor format diffs (Subject, greeting). -1.0 point.
- **Overall policy adherence**: Grounds most in data but violates "do NOT invent metrics" with % breaches/reductions. Strict penalty for all diffs.

Base 10.0 minus deductions = 4.2.
