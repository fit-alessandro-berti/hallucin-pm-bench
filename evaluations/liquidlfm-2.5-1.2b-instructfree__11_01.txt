**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically on correctness: wrong top-3 activities (Submit_Claim, Approve_Payment, Reject_Claim vs. ground truth Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability); systematically confuses/swaps Avg_Waiting_h and 95p_Waiting_h (e.g., Submit_Claim avg listed as 1.2 instead of 0.4; Reject_Claim p95 as 0.6 instead of 1.8); ignores table ranking by Avg_Waiting_h. Actions are generic, non-data-driven, lack ≥20% claims or evidence (vs. ground truth's pilots/estimates). Includes extraneous content (e.g., signature, subject line, vague closing). Exceeds "crisp memo" style, violates "strictly by waiting-time." Zero alignment with ground truth or table.
