3.0

The LLM answer commits several significant errors relative to the ground truth and shows only partial adherence to instructions:

**Major Issues:**
1. **Omission of "Operations Manager" Role:** The LLM answer ignores this role entirely, even though it appears in the ground truth (and is required to map Accountable).
2. **Incorrect Mapping of Accountability:** In the RACI model, every task should have only one Accountable (A). The LLM often marks Responsible but rarely clarifies accountability, and where it does, it assigns A to the Regulatory Liaison (e.g., for “Approve high-risk transactions”) but omits A on several steps.
3. **Consulted/Informed Assignments:** Modes of “Consulted” and “Informed” are inconsistently and sometimes inaccurately applied—e.g., “Notify completion to Regulatory Liaison” is not a ground-truth activity, and the ‘C’/’I’ split is arbitrary and not justified by the text.
4. **Task Naming:** The names of tasks are not faithfully aligned with the mandated vocabulary as demonstrated in the ground truth; some steps are fused or unnecessarily reworded (e.g., “Perform KYC Review for sender and beneficiary" vs the correct “KYC Review”).
5. **Structure & Vocabulary:** While the roles are more or less mapped to enforced synonyms, there is occasional ambiguity, and the structure diverges from the requested template.

**Minor Issues:**
- Not all tasks from the informal process are mapped 1:1.
- The table legend is included but RACI assignments diverge in meaning compared to the provided key.
- The LLM table contains some extraneous or invented steps (e.g., “Notify completion to Regulatory Liaison”).

**Positives:**
- At least some effort is made to use the correct terminology for roles.
- Responsibilities loosely correspond to those in the ground truth in some of the steps.

**Summary:**  
The answer falls well short of the precise requirements, omits a critical role, demonstrates notable inaccuracy in mapping RACI assignments, and introduces errors in task naming and decomposition. It cannot be scored higher than a low passing mark for only partial adherence and substantive omission/errors.
