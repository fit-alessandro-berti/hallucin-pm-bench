2.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Major Partial Credit, but Strict Deduction)**: The LLM correctly incorporates mandated terms ("KYC Review" for the activity, "Regulatory Liaison" and "Transaction Analyst" as roles) and avoids prohibited ones. However, it misuses "KYC Review" as a column header (treating an activity as a role), which violates the intent of "only the mandated terms for activities and roles." Ground truth uses "KYC Review" properly as a task/activity row. IT Support is retained in both, which aligns. Deduction: -2.0 for misuse.
  
- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Significant Errors)**: LLM covers all source steps but adds an extra task ("Notify completion to Regulatory Liaison") not present in ground truth, inflating the table unnecessarily (source step 6 is "compliance officer is notified," but GT integrates this implicitly via assignments without a separate row). LLM also splits "release" and "SWIFT sending" into two tasks, while GT combines archiving/notification implicitly and omits explicit SWIFT as a standalone. Ground truth has exactly 6 concise tasks directly mapped from source without additions. Differences in task phrasing (e.g., LLM's "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. GT's "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM's "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. GT's "Screen Against Sanctions List") are minor but cumulative under strictness. Deduction: -3.0 for extras and mismatches.

- **RACI Assignments (Critical Failure)**: Assignments are entirely divergent and incorrect relative to ground truth. Examples:
  - Receive/Log: LLM assigns only Transaction Analyst (R); GT assigns Transaction Analyst (R), Regulatory Liaison (I), Operations Manager (A), IT Support (C).
  - Screen: LLM only Transaction Analyst (R); GT: Transaction Analyst (R), Regulatory Liaison (A), Operations Manager (I), IT Support (C).
  - KYC Review: LLM assigns to "KYC Review" column (R), which is nonsensical; GT: Transaction Analyst (C), Regulatory Liaison (R), Operations Manager (A), IT Support (I).
  - Approve: LLM Regulatory Liaison (A,R); GT: Transaction Analyst (C), Regulatory Liaison (R), Operations Manager (A), IT Support (I).
  - Release: LLM Transaction Analyst (R); GT: Transaction Analyst (R), Regulatory Liaison (I), Operations Manager (A), IT Support (C).
  - Archive: LLM IT Support (R); GT: Transaction Analyst (C), Regulatory Liaison (I), Operations Manager (A), IT Support (R).
  - LLM omits GT's integrated accountability/consultation; adds unmatching "Notify" with odd (C,I) and (I). Ground truth consistently uses Operations Manager for (A), absent in LLM. Every cell differs. Deduction: -4.0 for total mismatch.

- **Table Structure and Formatting (Moderate Errors)**: Both use Markdown, but LLM uses "X (R)" notation (not in GT or prompt), adds unnecessary column for "KYC Review," includes extraneous intro text, RACI definitions (not requested), and a bolded "Notify" row. GT uses clean **R/A/C/I** bolding, simpler headers, a "Legend," and a concise note on compliance. LLM's structure is cluttered and deviates. Deduction: -1.5 for extras and non-matching format.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt and Source (Holistic Deduction)**: LLM attempts a RACI but introduces errors (e.g., activity-as-role, added task) not in source or GT. GT adheres strictly to source mapping without additions, though it adds "Operations Manager" (unmandated, but taken as ground truth). Small errors (phrasing, extras) compound under utmost strictness, but partial vocabulary use prevents a 1.0. Total alignment ~25%, justifying low score.
