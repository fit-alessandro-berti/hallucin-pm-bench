**10.0**

The LLM answer is virtually identical to the ground truth in substance, structure, and precision: both correctly start with "No", identify the exact same two counterexamples (C003 with lines 6 before 7; C005 with line 11 but no Receive_Order), use one-paragraph justification citing lines/cases, and conclude that Validate_Payment does not *always* follow Receive_Order. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "inaccurate" vs. "false"; "precedes...violating" vs. "occurs first...afterwards"; "cannot follow it" vs. "never contains") are semantically equivalent and do not alter accuracy, with no errors, omissions, or additions.
