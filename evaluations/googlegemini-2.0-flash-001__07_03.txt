The LLM answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, matching the ground truth verbatim in content and format for those sections. However, it misses a critical functional change: the Gateway_Payment type shift from exclusive to parallel, which is explicitly verifiable in the XML snippets (v1 uses `<exclusiveGateway>`, v2 uses `<parallelGateway>`). This omission represents approximately 50% incompleteness in the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section, warranting a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria. Additionally, minor formatting errors include extraneous leading dashes before each heading (violating the "verbatim" requirement for headings) and lack of alignment/indentation consistency seen in the ground truth for the second gateway entry (though not present in LLM output). These small issues compound the loss, preventing a higher score despite strong performance in two-thirds of the required sections.
