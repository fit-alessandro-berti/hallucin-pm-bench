6.0

The LLM answer:

- Correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, including ids and names.
- Correctly identifies the gateway type change for "Gateway_ReviewNeeded".
- **Misses the gateway type change for "Gateway_Payment"**, which is explicitly required per the ground truth and visible in the XML comparison.
- Uses improper bullet formatting; the prompt asks for headings as shown ("ADDED TASKS" with no dash or colon) and the required grouping format.
- These constitute clear format and content errors.

Strict grading: Missing a functional change is a major error. The score is heavily penalized for this, along with the format deviations.
