**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and violates BPMN 2.0 standards:
- Proposes invalid "timer start event to the process root" (processes can't have multiple starts; timer starts initiate on schedule, not post-submission deadlines).
- Invents non-existent BPMN concepts ("schedule Arranging Flow (SAF)", "Escalation Steps (ES)"), implying new activities despite prohibition.
- Fails to reference element IDs (e.g., no "Task_Triage", "Task_Receive").
- No <timeDuration> like PT48H; vague "48-hour deadline".
- Doesn't solve SLA: won't bypass incompleteness/docs loop to reach triage in 48h from submission.
- Ground truth uses precise interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive → Task_Triage, fully compliant. Total mismatch.
