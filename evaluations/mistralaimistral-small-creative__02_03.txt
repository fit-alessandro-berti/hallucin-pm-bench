**9.5**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all three questions, with correct identification of cases, predecessor activity (verified by sorting C456 events chronologically: Create_Order 09:10 → Validate_Order 09:20 → Pack_Items 09:35 → Ship_Order 09:40), and unique activity (Cancel_Order appears once; all others ≥2). It uses the requested bullet-point format and is concise overall.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for:
- Slight verbosity in Q2/Q3 phrasing vs. ground truth's ultra-minimalism (full sentences vs. bare terms).
- Trivial variations in Q1 ("distinct", backticks) and labeling (1./2./3. vs. A1/A2/A3).

Under utmost strictness, these small stylistic differences warrant a small but noticeable loss, but do not detract from core correctness.
