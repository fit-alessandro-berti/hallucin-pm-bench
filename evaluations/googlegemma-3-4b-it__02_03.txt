The LLM answer is highly accurate, matching the ground truth on all core content (number of cases, preceding activity for C456, and unique activity). The only minor deviation is omitting the case identifiers in Q1, which are not explicitly required by the prompt but are included in the ground truth for clarity; this does not constitute an error but warrants a slight deduction for not fully mirroring the elaboration under utmost strictness.
