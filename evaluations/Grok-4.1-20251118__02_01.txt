8.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1–Q4, demonstrating accurate extraction of distinct cases (3), preceding activity ("Pack_Items"), earliest timestamp, and activity count (2). However, Q5 contains a significant error: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an extraneous item in the list. The list also omits proper exclusion of this activity, violating the strict requirement to use only log-derived facts without inference or error. Under utmost strictness, this factual inaccuracy in one key response warrants a substantial deduction (equivalent to ~20% penalty for the partial correctness of Q5, which includes the right items but adds an invalid one), lowering the score from a perfect 10.0.
