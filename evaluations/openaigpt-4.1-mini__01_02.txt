8.0

**Rationale for Scoring:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer uses the exact required terminology for both the decision points and the required documents.
- All three decision points are properly identified by their correct names.
- The required documents list is complete, with all six documents named, and uses the precise terminology specified in the process.
- The flow and structure strongly resemble the ground truth.

**Errors/Points Deducted:**
- **Contextual Placement:** The LLM answer omits *where* in the process the decision points occur (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), whereas the ground truth makes this explicit. This is a small but important detail, particularly for strict grading.
- **Detail Level:** The LLM answer provides some mild elaboration in describing the roles of Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B, which, while not introducing standard loan terminology, is a slight deviation from the strictly minimal style used in the ground truth.
- **Document List:** The LLM answer includes the label “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template,” whereas the ground truth simply says “Community Impact Statement (CIS)”. The word ‘template’ could imply a form, which departs slightly from using *only* the specified term.
- **Final comment:** The LLM adds "This completes the summary as per the exact terminology and flow stated." which is unnecessary, though does not detract from correctness.

Given the required “utmost strictness,” these minor departures, particularly around process location/context and precise document naming, warrant significant deduction. Therefore, the answer is very good but not perfect. **8.0**
