### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies and describes the three core decision points using the exact activity names from the prompt (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval), without introducing prohibited standard loan terminology. It also lists all six required documents verbatim in name and form. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Decision Points (minor deductions: -1.0 total)**: 
  - Misses contextual placement details from ground truth (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for point 1; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for point 2), which are explicit in the process flow and ground truth.
  - Slight wording variances: "escalate to" vs. ground truth's "send to" for MBA; "proceed" vs. "continue"; "votes to approve or reject" vs. bolded/capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**". These are small but accumulate as deviations.
  
- **Required Documents (minor deductions: -0.5 total)**: 
  - Exact list is complete, but phrasing differs: Adds "old" to Proof of Address; inserts "single" and changes "/ " to "or" in Income Statement; adds "template" to CIS. Ground truth's concise versions (e.g., "pay-stub/tax slip", "(CIS)") are not matched precisely. Omits the ground truth's closing note on exclusions, which reinforces the "every required document" focus by contrast.
  
- **Structure and Extras (minor deduction: -0.0, but noted)**: Fluff like "Certainly!" intro and "This completes..." closing adds unnecessary content not in ground truth, slightly reducing conciseness. Formatting (bullets vs. numbering, "###" vs. "####") is functionally similar but not identical.

The answer is highly faithful overall (core content matches ~90%), justifying a high score, but strict adherence demands penalties for every phrasing/contextual discrepancy.
