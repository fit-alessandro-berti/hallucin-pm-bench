The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be derived due to the absence of timestamps and elapsed times, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning (lack of temporal data preventing computation). It adheres to the system policy by refusing to fabricate data and provides a brief, relevant explanation that implicitly covers both the query's numeric request and calculation justification. Minor deduction for slightly less comprehensive detail on "ordering information" and "per-event temporal values" compared to the ground truth, but this is a negligible phrasing variance without substantive error.
