### Evaluation Reasoning
- **R1**: Matching status (Compliant) and similar justification (both confirm sequence for high amount). No deduction.
- **R2**: Incorrect status (LLM: Compliant; Ground Truth: Violated). LLM fails to recognize that the change request (per R5) requires a new approval, making the 03-07 Manager_Approval the "last required approval"; Ship_Goods on 03-05 occurs before this, violating the "after" timing. Major analytical error; significant deduction.
- **R3**: Matching status (Violated) and equivalent justification (Pay before Receive). No deduction.
- **R4**: Matching status (Not Applicable) and equivalent justification (hazardous=false). No deduction.
- **R5**: Matching status (Violated), but justification incomplete—LLM focuses only on Ship_Goods, omitting Pay_Invoice as a "further processing step" before new approval (as in Ground Truth). Minor but notable gap under strictness; small deduction.
- **R6**: Matching status (Compliant) and equivalent justification. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by R2 error. Format adheres to prompt (statuses, concise justifications ≤20 words, all-caps conclusion).
- **Total**: One critical rule error (R2) and one minor justification issue warrant a mid-low score; strict evaluation penalizes analytical inaccuracy heavily despite partial correctness.
