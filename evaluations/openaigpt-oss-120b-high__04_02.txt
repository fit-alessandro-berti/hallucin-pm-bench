6.5

**Analysis with strictness and justification:**

- **R1:** Correctly marked as Compliant, with accurate interpretation of sequence. (+0)
- **R2:** Incorrectly marked as Compliant. The LLM takes Finance_Approval as the "last required approval," but after a Change_Request, a new Manager_Approval should be considered the final approval per R5. As Ship_Goods is before the new Manager_Approval, R2 is Violated, not Compliant. This is a significant error (−2 points).
- **R3:** Correctly marked as Violated, justified well. (+0)
- **R4:** Correctly marked as Not Applicable. (+0)
- **R5:** Correctly marked as Violated, with correct justification regarding post-approval Change_Request and downstream steps. (+0)
- **R6:** Correctly marked as Compliant. (+0)

**Format:** 
- The LLM uses the format requested, is concise, and gives standard-compliant justifications. (+0)
- It does not explicitly tie the R2 justification to the effect of R5, which underlies the error above. (Already penalized for R2.)

**Overall result:** Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). (+0)

**Summary:** 
- 1 major rule misjudged (R2).
- Otherwise mostly correct, but this is a core, scenario-specific compliance logic error. 
- Minus 2 points for R2, minus 1.5 for not explicitly tying R2–R5 interaction (because the rules are closely linked and this demonstrates incomplete process analysis). 

**Final score:** 6.5
