The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Format and Structure**: The ground truth uses a clean, standard Markdown table with rows for tasks and columns for roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support), plus a concise legend. The LLM answer uses a malformed, non-tabular Markdown structure (resembling a vertical list with bold headers and inconsistent spacing/blanks), failing to create a proper RACI matrix. This alone is a major structural error.

- **Roles**: The ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a key column/role with assignments (e.g., accountable in most tasks). The LLM answer omits this entirely, using only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support, resulting in incomplete role coverage and mismatched accountability distributions.

- **Tasks**: Task naming and granularity differ substantially. The ground truth has exactly 6 tasks ("Receive Payment Instruction", "Screen Against Sanctions List", "KYC Review", "Approve High-Risk Transactions", "Release Payment", "Archive Record"), with precise mapping (e.g., "KYC Review" bolded as mandated). The LLM answer has 8 tasks, including extras like "Send SWIFT payment message" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison upon case archive" (splitting informal steps 5-6 unnecessarily), and rephrases others (e.g., "Log payment instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review" with "on sender and beneficiary" omitted). This introduces omissions, additions, and inconsistencies with the source text.

- **RACI Assignments**: Assignments are largely mismatched. For example:
  - Ground truth: "Receive Payment Instruction" has TA (R), RL (I), OM (A), IT (C). LLM: TA (R), RL (A and I), no OM/IT explicit.
  - "KYC Review": Ground truth has RL (R), OM (A), TA (C), IT (I). LLM: RL (R and A), no others.
  - "Release Payment": Ground truth has TA (R), RL (I), OM (A), IT (C). LLM: TA (R), RL (A), no IT.
  - High-risk approval and screening also diverge (e.g., ground truth has TA as C for approval; LLM has TA as C but RL as R/A).
  - The LLM's use of blanks for C/I in many cells creates ambiguity, unlike the ground truth's comprehensive assignments. No equivalent to ground truth's IT (R) for "Archive Record".

- **Vocabulary and Fidelity**: While the LLM correctly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and avoids prohibited ones, it fails to "map every step from the source text... without omissions or substitutions" per the ground truth's example. Extra introductory text ("### RACI Matrix...") and explanatory legend/notes in the LLM add unnecessary content not present in the ground truth.

- **Overall Completeness**: The LLM expands beyond the informal description (e.g., separate notification task) and ignores implied higher-level accountability (Operations Manager), leading to a less accurate representation of the process. Small errors like inconsistent blank cells and poor Markdown compound the issues.

These differences indicate the LLM answer does not closely replicate the ground truth's precise, mandated, and structured output, justifying severe point deduction.
