**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top 3 activities by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes waiting times verbatim, stays ≤150 words, and provides one action per activity promising ≥20% reduction. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major violations (significant deductions):** Explicitly mentions forbidden non-waiting metrics 6 times (service times: 0.2h, 0.4h; executions: 275, 255, 310), breaching "Do **not** discuss service-time, throughput" and ground truth note to "omit all non-waiting metrics." This unwarranted content appears in every action.
- **Differences from ground truth:** Completely different actions (not just phrasing; e.g., no automation portal, pre-gen templates, or dedicated assessors vs. reminders, e-signature, rules-engine); fuller memo format vs. concise list; minor extras like headers/date.
- **No other errors,** but violations alone warrant ~50% penalty vs. a perfect match.
