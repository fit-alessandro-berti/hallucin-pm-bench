### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s quantified accurately via throughput - SLA) and high waits. Structure mimics memo format with To/From/Subject, analysis section, and bulleted recs only for recommendations (~140 words, close to 150). Matches data exclusively (no absent activities/metrics).
- **Major deductions (significant point loss per strictness)**:
  - Factual error: Claims Credit Assessment has "the highest absolute waiting time (200s)" – false (Legal 600s > Risk 480s > Credit 200s); undermines joint criteria justification.
  - Invented/derived metrics not in table: Percentages (80%, 67%) and phrases like "industry-leading waiting time," "constituting 80%," violating "ground every sentence in data; do NOT invent metrics."
  - Differences from ground truth: Order swapped (Risk 1st vs Legal 1st); different headers/subject/From line; numbered analysis list vs bolded paragraphs; analysis phrasing/intro diverges (no case total, "end-to-end process" vs "4 805 cases"/"queues"); recommendations entirely different/unrelated actions (no overlap with ground truth's pre-checks/analyst add/€25k heuristic); no closing projection.
  - Minor: "Recommended actions:" header vs "**Recommended actions**"; recs prefixed with activity name (not in ground truth bullets).

Overall ~60% similarity in core content; errors/inventions/differences deduct heavily.
