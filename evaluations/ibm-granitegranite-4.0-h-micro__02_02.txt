4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth (3 distinct cases). No errors. Score: 10.0/10.0.
- **Q2**: Major factual inaccuracies and omissions. The ground truth sequence for C002 is "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" (4 activities, in chronological order from the log: lines 2, 5, 8, 10). The LLM answer hallucinates an incomplete sequence ("Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery"), missing "Receive_Order" (first event) and "Ship_Order" (final event), and fails to include the full ordered trace. This is a severe error in completeness and accuracy, treating the case as having only 2 events instead of 4. Strict deduction for factual hallucination by omission. Score: 1.0/10.0.
- **Q3**: Partial correctness in identifying the distinct activities ("Check_Stock" and "Arrange_Delivery" from C001/C003 and C002, respectively), but significant format and ordering violations. Ground truth requires "one per line, alphabetically ordered" (A: "Arrange_Delivery" before C: "Check_Stock", using bullet/list format). LLM uses incorrect "→" separator (mimicking Q2 style), lists on one line, and reverses alphabetical order (Check_Stock before Arrange_Delivery). This introduces presentation errors and non-compliance with instructions, treated as partial hallucination in structure. Score: 4.0/10.0.

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average across questions (equal weight), with utmost strictness for any deviation (e.g., omissions in Q2 as total failure; format/order issues in Q3 as major penalty). (10.0 + 1.0 + 4.0) / 3 = 5.0, adjusted down to 4.5 for cumulative impact of hallucinations and non-adherence to output format in a multi-part response.
