**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Structural differences (major deduction: -4.0)**: LLM uses only 2 role columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison); ground truth has 4 (adds Operations Manager, IT Support). Omits critical IT Support role from source text, reassigning its tasks (e.g., SWIFT send, archive) incorrectly to Analyst.
- **Task coverage/mapping (major deduction: -2.0)**: 8 tasks vs. ground truth's 6. Adds extras ("Ensure SWIFT message is sent", "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion"); alters names (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"). Omits exact mandated phrasing consistency; ground truth maps source steps precisely without extras/omissions.
- **RACI assignments (major deduction: -1.5)**: Almost no matches. E.g.:
  | Task | LLM | Ground Truth (key cells) | Match? |
  |------|-----|---------------------------|--------|
  | Receive | R/I | R/I/**A**/C | Partial |
  | Screen | R/C | R/**A**/I/C | No |
  | KYC Review | I/R-A | C/**R**/**A**/I | No |
  | Approve | I/A | C/**R**/**A**/I | No |
  | Release | R/A | **R**/I/**A**/C | No |
  Others unmapped or wrong.
  Non-standard "R/A" combo used.
- **Formatting/Compliance (minor but strict deduction: -0.5)**: No "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header phrasing. No **bold** on R/A/C/I cells. No "Legend". Markdown table valid but lacks ground truth's exact style (e.g., capitalization, bold tasks like "**KYC Review**").
- **Vocabulary (partial credit: +1.0 base)**: Correctly uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst” where applicable; no forbidden terms. But fails "only mandated... without omissions or substitutions" by not fully mapping source (IT Support unaddressed).

Total mismatches dominate; score reflects ~20% alignment under utmost strictness.
