The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as the ground truth, prioritizing them jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times, which is the strongest alignment. Quantification of SLA exceedances is mostly accurate in seconds (+300 s for Legal Approval, +60 s for Credit Assessment), but deviates for Risk Review by using a percentage breach (100%) instead of absolute seconds (+300 s), introducing a small but notable inconsistency with the ground truth's format and the table's units. The memo structure uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations as required, and the overall length approximates 150 words.

However, significant deductions apply due to multiple differences: the header format (full TO/FROM/DATE/SUBJECT vs. ground truth's simpler To/From/Subject) includes invented elements like the date; the order of activities differs (Risk first vs. Legal first in ground truth, potentially altering perceived severity); an introductory sentence is added not present in the ground truth; and the recommendations section shows zero substantive overlapâ€”LLM's actions (staffing increase, parallel processing, investigation) are entirely distinct from the ground truth's (pre-checks, analyst addition/automation, straight-through heuristic), with both inventing unsupported details but failing to match. The absence of the ground truth's concluding projection and case total reference further highlights divergence. Under strict evaluation, these structural, ordering, and content mismatches in key sections warrant a halving of potential score from full alignment.
