7.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities as the ground truth: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.
- The throughput time over SLA and waiting times are accurately noted for these activities (although, in "Legal Approval," the overage is presented as 300 s over SLA, which matches the data).
- The memo stays within the scope of the table data, does not mention extra activities or metrics, and uses bullet points for recommendations.
- No invented metrics or additional activities appear in the response.

**Deficiencies (penalized strictly as instructed):**
- The LLM references the throughput time for Credit Assessment as “300 seconds, 60 seconds over target.” The actual overage is 60 seconds (matches), but it could be clearer to explicitly state (e.g., "average throughput 300 s vs. 240 s SLA, +60 s").
- The number of cases processed is omitted from the LLM answer's summary paragraph, while the ground truth explicitly reports the total cases analyzed ("4 805 completed cases"), providing stronger analytical grounding.
- The action recommendations are less specific and less clearly data-driven than in the ground truth:
  - For Legal Approval: "Implement a parallel review process... to target a 50% reduction" is less direct than the ground truth’s "rule-based pre-checks so low-risk files bypass full Legal Approval."
  - For Risk Review: "Increase staffing levels by 20%" is referenced to the percentage of SLA breach, but the ground truth is more concrete and grounded in data: "Add one risk analyst to the peak morning window and automate external score retrieval."
  - For Credit Assessment: The LLM recommends an investigation rather than an intervention; the ground truth recommends a concrete operational change based on loan value.
- The LLM does not explicitly state the projected impact of recommendations (like the "reduce end-to-end cycle time by 35%" in the ground truth), missing out on a data-based projected benefit.
- The subject line and introduction are more generic and lack the data specificity of the ground truth memo.

**Conclusion:**  
While the LLM answer is accurate in identifying the problematic activities and quantifying their breaches, it loses significant points on the specificity, actionability, and concreteness of its recommendations and omits some critical details (case count, projected impact). Thus, the score reflects a good but not exemplary response.
