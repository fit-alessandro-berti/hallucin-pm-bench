**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Major semantic error (-4.0 points)**: Uses `cancelActivity="false"` (non-interrupting), allowing "Create Account" to continue indefinitely post-timer (failing to enforce SLA completion within 48h by not canceling the task); ground truth correctly uses `cancelActivity="true"` (interrupting) to stop the breaching task and escalate.
- **XML validity error (-1.5 points)**: Omits `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<bpmn:timeDuration>`, inconsistent with BPMN 2.0 schema usage in the original XML and ground truth.
- **Justification mismatch (-1.0 point)**: Describes "non-interrupting timer" (incorrect for enforcement) vs. ground truth's accurate "interrupting" emphasis; minor phrasing differences.
- **Minor issues (-0.5 point)**: Lacks ground truth's `name="48h breach"`, specific IDs/comments for clarity; different flow ID.
- **Strengths (+0.0 net)**: Correctly targets "Activity_CreateAccount", uses `PT48H`, connects to existing "Activity_AMReview", no new activities, one-sentence justification format. Overall, fundamentally flawed enforcement mechanism despite partial structural match.
