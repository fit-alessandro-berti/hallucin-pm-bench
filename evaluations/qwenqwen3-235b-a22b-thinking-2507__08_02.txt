**Score: 9.0**

**Rationale:**

- The LLM correctly answers Q1 ("Yes") and provides the correct minimal firing sequence for T5 firing before T3 in Q2.
- The ordering of transitions is correct, and the brief explanation shows understanding that T2, T7, T4 can produce P5 while the token in P2 is kept, and thus T5 can fire before T3.
- The LLM notes that firing T5 with the available tokens disables T3, matching the explanation in the ground truth.
- Small issues:
  - The explanation (for strictness): The LLM could have explicitly mentioned the intermediate markings, which are shown stepwise in the ground truth. This omission, while not critical for understanding, shows a slight lack of precision.
  - The answer states "T5 requires P2 and P5 (both present), firing before T3—which needs only P2—is possible," which is accurate but a bit less clear than the ground truth's explicit marking transitions.
  - The LLM puts “(118 words)” which is unnecessary.

**Strict deduction:**  
Because of the missing stepwise marking progression and slightly less explicit marking details, **1 point** is deducted for precision and completeness. Otherwise, the answer is thorough, logical, and matches the ground truth in substance.
