The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) as the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3 by consuming the P2 token directly. The explanation accurately captures the key mechanism (token in P2 persists while P5 is produced via the alternative path), stays under 120 words, and aligns closely with the ground truth's logic.

Minor deductions: Lacks explicit markings (e.g., M₁ = {P1, P2}), which ground truth includes for state verification; slightly less emphasis on T3 being disabled post-T5; minor formatting difference (arrow vs. numbered list). No factual errors, but strictness applied for completeness and precision.
