### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, accuracy, and fidelity to the prompt, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% point deduction)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 decision points with precise branching logic (eligibility check, amount threshold, final payment approval) tied directly to defined activities. The LLM inflates this to 5 invented or misattributed points (e.g., "High-Value Determination" as a standalone decision after Finance_Controller_PreApprove, and "Payment Authorization" as a separate step, which conflates the constraint before Process_Refund_Payment). This introduces non-defined activities and overcomplicates the process. Descriptions add unsubstantiated interpretations (e.g., "to verify booking" or "meet Contoso’s financial/refund rules"), violating the "do not introduce" rule. No table format or clear branching/outcomes (e.g., "Not eligible → rejected") as in ground truth, reducing clarity and accuracy.

- **Required Documents (Moderate Errors, ~20% point deduction)**: The prompt requires a complete, separate list of all documents. The LLM embeds them per (flawed) decision point instead of providing a unified list, scattering coverage and omitting a clean catalogue. It correctly identifies the 7 core documents (RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF) but introduces an undefined artefact ("Calculation of refund amount"), directly breaching the "do not introduce any artefacts" rule. The note on AuditTrail's conditional use is implied but not explicitly catalogued as in ground truth. RefundConfirmationPDF is mentioned only casually at the end, not integrated properly.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor but Cumulative Errors, ~20% point deduction)**: No adherence to ground truth's table + bulleted list format, making it harder to parse. The LLM adds extraneous summary text (e.g., "Once all decisions are positive...") not in the prompt or process. It avoids the legacy activity (good), but small additions like decision purposes erode strict compliance. Total differences exceed superficial alignment, reflecting poor summarization of the exact process description.
