The LLM answer accurately identifies the non-compliance ("No") and correctly assesses all four rules with the same conclusions as the ground truth: Rule 1 satisfied (QE once and before RA), Rule 2 satisfied (VP after both QE/RA for High severity), Rule 3 violated (NA before RA completion, despite requiring after both QE and RA), and Rule 4 satisfied (CC after NA and VP). The justification is concise, precise, and references the trace steps effectively, matching the ground truth's reasoning without factual errors. Minor deduction for lack of table format and explicit "once each" phrasing in Rule 1 (though implied and correct), but this does not impact core accuracy under strict evaluation.
