7.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct overall verdict ("Non-compliant"). Accurately identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with correct reasoning and event citations. Rule 1, 4, and 5 correctly deemed satisfied. Matches ground truth on substance for compliance status per rule.
- **Major errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **Contradictory mislabeling**: Point 4 explicitly labels "**Rule 3 satisfied**" then immediately contradicts with "**this is a violation**" – direct factual error in labeling (loss of 1.5 pts).
  - **Non-systematic structure**: Rules checked out-of-order (2, then 4,1,3,5) vs. ground truth's sequential 1-5 coverage. Misses clean per-rule numbering (loss of 1.0 pt).
- **Minor errors (further deductions)**:
  - Unnecessary/confusing text in Rule 4 (e.g., "next event involving a human role sequence" – irrelevant, adds confusion despite correct conclusion; loss of 0.3 pt).
  - Inaccurate distance phrasing for Rule 3 ("4 activities later (steps 7–9 in between)" implies 3 steps but says "4"; ground truth precisely "distance = 3" – sloppy quantification; loss of 0.2 pt).
- **Formatting/style diffs**: Bolded subsections, inconsistent completeness notes, and "Overall:" summary deviate from ground truth's clean "Justification 1-5 + summary" (minor but cumulative loss of 0.0 pt as format flexible).
- **Strict total**: 10 - 3.0 (errors) = 7.0. Substance strong (no wrong violation claims), but presentation/precision flaws warrant deductions per "utmost strictness" and "small errors → significant loss."
