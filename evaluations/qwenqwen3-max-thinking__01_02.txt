### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Correctly identifies all 3 core decision points using exact activity names (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)). Logic matches precisely (e.g., ≤2 difference continue/escalate; <€15k auto-approve, ≥€15k to MBA; board votes approve/reject). Lists all 6 required documents exactly as in prompt/ground truth core (no omissions/additions).
- **Errors/Differences (significant deductions, per strict criteria)**:
  - **Decision Points (-1.0 total)**:
    - Introduces "step 6" (not in ground truth or required; violates "use exactly activity names" by referencing numbering).
    - Missing key contexts: "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (-0.4).
    - Extra descriptive phrases ("Compares the risk scores...", "the process continues to...", "requested loan **amount**", "(only for amounts ≥ €15 000)") not in ground truth (-0.4).
    - "> 2 points" phrasing vs ground truth's clean "≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else ⇒" (-0.1); lowercase "approve/reject" vs "**Approve** or **Reject**" (-0.1).
  - **Required Documents (-0.5 total)**:
    - Minor phrasing mismatches vs ground truth: "≤ 3 months old" vs "≤ 3 months" (-0.1); "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs "pay-stub/tax slip" (-0.1); "(CIS) template" vs "(CIS)" (-0.1).
    - Lacks ground truth's extra clarifying note ("*(No credit bureau...)*") and numbering style (-0.2).
  - **Structure/Style (-0.3)**: More verbose/narrative vs ground truth's concise "####" headers, numbering, and "⇒" syntax; adds bolding/italics inconsistently.
- **Overall**: ~85% match in content/accuracy, but cumulative small errors (10+ diffs) deduct heavily per instructions. No major factual errors, so not below 8.0.
