8.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Overall fidelity**: The LLM answer captures both decision points accurately and lists all 9 documents correctly in first-appearance order (Form 14B → scorecards → Deck Memo → Offer Sheet 77 → Signed Offer Sheet 77 → ID Matrix Declaration → Loan Dossier 2025). No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML). Structure follows prompt closely.
- **Part a) strengths**: Identifies exactly 2 decision points. Rules summarized in one sentence each, faithful to process (e.g., "Low or Medium AND ≤ €250,000" skip; "at least two of three" for TriVote).
- **Part a) errors** (significant deductions for differences from ground truth phrasing):
  - Title phrasing differs ("Conditional skip after... (Step 4)" vs. ground truth's "Risk-based skip after..."); adds unnecessary step reference.
  - a1 omits explicit "otherwise proceeds to review" contrast present in ground truth; implies but doesn't match.
  - a2 adds "otherwise it fails" (logical inference but absent from process/ground truth); uses "approve" vs. ground truth's "record “Approve.”"; minor title/step differences.
- **Part b) strengths**: Exact sequence and all items match.
- **Part b) errors** (major deduction):
  - Adds extraneous caveat "*(only if Step 5 is not skipped)*" to Deck Memo, altering clean list format and introducing unrequested conditional qualifier (prompt asks for unconditional list of all "required anywhere"; ground truth has none).
- **Minor errors** (further deductions per strictness rule):
  - Currency formatting: "€250,000" (comma, American-style) vs. process/ground truth "€250 000" (space, European-style).
  - Extra subtitles/formatting (e.g., "### a) Decision points (gates / conditional branches)").
- **Scoring**: Starts at 10.0; deduct 1.0 for b caveat (clear deviation); 0.5 for a phrasing omissions/additions; 0.3 for currency; 0.2 for minor formatting/extras = 8.0. Very close but multiple small differences warrant significant loss.
