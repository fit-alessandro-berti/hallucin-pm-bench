The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides accurate counterexamples (C002 and C004) with precise sequences, while noting compliance in C001 and C003 to address the "always" claim. This aligns closely with the ground truth's conclusion and case-specific analysis. Minor deductions for: (1) lack of a structured table format mirroring the ground truth's presentation; (2) slightly less exhaustive case-by-case detailing (summarizes compliant cases without explicit sequences for all, unlike the table); and (3) inclusion of irrelevant post-Validate_Payment activity in C004's sequence (Pack_Items), which, while factually correct, deviates from the ground truth's focused "sequence around Receive_Order." No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes these presentation and completeness differences.
