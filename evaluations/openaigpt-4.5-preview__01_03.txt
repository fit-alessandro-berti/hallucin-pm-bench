5.5

a) The LLM answer correctly identifies the two actual decision points: the conditional skip after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, and the “TriVote” approval gate. However, it incorrectly lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a "decision point/gate" (it's an assessment step, not a process gate or routing decision), which is not in the ground truth answer. The other descriptions are generally accurate, but some wording is less precise than the ground truth (e.g., less clarity on the “at least two of three” for TriVote; LLM says “any two… suffice for pass,” but doesn’t explicitly state the loan advances only if at least two of three approve). Minor deduction for imprecision.

b) The LLM answer omits **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta,** and **Scorecard–Yellow** from the document list, which are explicitly required inputs for a process decision and present in the ground truth answer. This is a significant error, especially as the prompt’s process notes them as “required anywhere in the process.” The rest of the list/sequence is correct, but this omission is substantial—failing to capture all required documents is a critical flaw.

Final grade: 5.5 (Major omission in document list, minor conceptual and language imprecision for the decision points).
