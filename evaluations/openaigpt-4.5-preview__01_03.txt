3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 4.0/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two actual decision points (the risk-based skip in Step 4 and the TriVote gate in Step 6) but inflates the count to three by erroneously treating the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3) as a "decision point" itself, when it is merely an evaluative input/step preceding the true conditional branch. This mischaracterization introduces a factual error and deviates from the ground truth's precise identification of only two gates/branches. The description of the skip condition is accurate but lacks the ground truth's explicit "bypass/proceeds" phrasing for outcomes. The TriVote summary is mostly aligned but uses slightly imprecise wording ("requiring votes... any two suffice") compared to the ground truth's clearer "at least two... record 'Approve'", and it omits the mandatory involvement of all three roles before voting. These issues, including the extraneous point, warrant significant deduction under strict criteria.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 3.0/10)**: Major omissions of the three scorecards (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow), which are explicitly listed as inputs/documents in Step 3 and thus required in the process (appearing before the Deck Memo). This results in an incomplete list (6 items vs. ground truth's 9), fundamentally undermining completeness. The order of the included items is mostly correct (e.g., Form 14B first, then Deck Memo when applicable, Offer Sheet 77, etc.), and Signed Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration are appropriately separated and placed in Step 8's order. Noting the Deck Memo's conditionality is a minor addition not harmful but unnecessary. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), but the scorecard miss is a critical gap reflecting poor attention to the process description.

- **Overall (Weighted Average, Strict Lens)**: Both parts show partial understanding but suffer from key inaccuracies (extra/misidentified element in a; omissions in b), leading to substantial divergence from the ground truth. No perfect alignment, and errors are not minor— they alter the core summary and list integrity.
