2.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
This score reflects strict adherence to the instruction: maximal penalty for any deviation from the ground truth, with even minor differences (e.g., vocabulary slips, task phrasing, structural mismatches) causing significant point deductions. The LLM answer captures the core process but diverges substantially in format, roles, task granularity, assignments, and vocabulary compliance, leading to a low score. Key differences, weighted by severity:

- **Format/Structure (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: Ground truth uses a compact matrix with tasks in rows, roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) in columns, and R/A/C/I letters in cells (with bolding for emphasis). LLM uses a traditional columnar format (Task | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed) with roles named inline, includes an unnecessary "# RACI Table" header and explanatory section (absent in ground truth), and a legend-like explanation that restates basics. This mismatches the ground truth's clean, role-column layout and adds extraneous content, violating "organise the RACI matrix clearly" implicitly through non-alignment.

- **Roles (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: Ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a key accountable role across tasks (inferred but integral to its RACI logic). LLM omits this entirely, defaulting accountability to the performer (e.g., Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison), which alters assignments (e.g., no OM as A for screening or archiving). Both use mandated terms (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison) correctly for core roles, but LLM retains "IT Support" without issue. However, the omission of Operations Manager creates systemic misalignment.

- **Tasks and Coverage (Major Deduction: -2.5 points)**: Ground truth has exactly 6 consolidated tasks (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "Archive Record"), mapping source steps faithfully with mandated phrasing (e.g., "**KYC Review**", no extras). LLM expands to 8 tasks, unnecessarily splitting step 5 ("Ensure SWIFT message is sent") and step 6 ("Notify compliance officer" and "Archive case file"), leading to fragmentation and omissions in consolidation. Task phrasings differ (e.g., LLM's verbose "Receive and log customer transfer instruction into system" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM's "Perform KYC Review..." adds unmandated "Perform"). No omissions, but extras and rephrasing inflate differences.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -1.5 points)**: Assignments rarely match fully. Examples:
  - Receive: Ground truth (TA: R, RL: I, OM: A, IT: C) vs. LLM (TA: R/A, RL: C) – Wrong on A (OM missing), C/I swapped.
  - Screen: Ground truth (TA: R, RL: A, OM: I, IT: C) vs. LLM (TA: R/A, RL: C) – A misplaced (RL instead of self), no OM I or IT C.
  - KYC Review: Partial match (RL: R/A in LLM vs. RL: R/OM: A; TA: C in both; misses IT: I and OM: A).
  - Approve: Similar partial mismatch (misses OM: A, IT: I).
  - Release: Ground truth (TA: R, RL: I, OM: A, IT: C) vs. LLM (TA: R/A, RL: C) – Swaps I/C, misses OM/IT.
  - Archive: Ground truth (IT: R, TA: C, RL: I, OM: A) vs. LLM (IT: R, RL: A) – Misses TA: C/RL: I, wrong A.
  - Extras in LLM (SWIFT/Notify) have no ground truth equivalents, adding ungrounded assignments (e.g., TA: A for SWIFT; RL: I for Notify but with wrong task name).
  These inconsistencies compound across the table.

- **Vocabulary Mandate Compliance (Major Deduction: -1.5 points)**: Prompt demands *strict* use of "KYC Review" (no "Perform"), "Regulatory Liaison" (no "compliance officer"), "Transaction Analyst" (applied correctly). LLM mostly complies (e.g., "KYC Review", swaps clerk/officer correctly), but violates in "Notify compliance officer" (uses forbidden "compliance officer" instead of "Regulatory Liaison"). Task phrasings like "high-risk transaction (if flagged)" vs. ground truth's "Approve High-Risk Transactions" introduce minor unsubtle variations. Ground truth exemplifies perfect mandated wording (e.g., "**KYC Review**" bolded). Explanation section in LLM reinforces mandates but can't offset the table slip.

- **Overall Fidelity and Clarity (Minor but Penalized Deductions: -0.5 points total)**: LLM covers the source text without major inventions beyond splits, but the ground truth's notes (e.g., "Uses **only** the enforced synonyms... without omissions") highlight LLM's vocabulary error and extra tasks as direct violations. No adult/offensive content issues, but strictness demands perfection in mapping.

Base score starts at 10.0; cumulative deductions yield 2.5. The answer is functional as a RACI but fails as a close match to the ground truth due to pervasive structural, content, and compliance differences.
