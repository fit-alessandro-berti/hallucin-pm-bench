**Score: 9.0**

**Justification:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies every added and removed task, as well as the gateway-type change.
- Minor deductions:
  - For "Gateway-type changes", the LLM simply says: "*Gateway_Decision* changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway." The ground truth specifies "exclusive (XOR)" and "inclusive (OR)", making the types clearer with their informal names; the LLM omits "(XOR)" and "(OR)".
  - In the "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" sections, the order and naming are equivalent, but the format is slightly less formal than ground truth (e.g., use of bullets instead of numbered lists).
- There are no major factual errors or omissions. Grouping and categorization matches instructions.
- Given utmost strictness, the absence of "(XOR)/(OR)" qualifiers and slight formatting reductions warrant the one-point deduction.
