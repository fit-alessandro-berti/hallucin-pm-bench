**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in conclusion (cannot compute/derive the value due to absent temporal data) and reasoning (explicit lack of timestamps/durations precludes cycle time calculation). It matches the system role's phrasing ("cannot be derived"), structures responses to match the numbered user questions, directly quotes the redacted fields from context for precision, and correctly dismisses irrelevant benchmarks—adding completeness without deviation or error. No factual, logical, or stylistic discrepancies; zero loss warranted even under strict evaluation.
