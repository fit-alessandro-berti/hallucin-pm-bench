The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately assesses Rules 1, 2, 4, and 5 against the ground truth (with minor phrasing differences but no factual errors). However, it commits a major error in Rule 3 by incorrectly deeming it compliant (miscalculating the distance from event 6 to 10 as â‰¤2, when it is 3 or 4 depending on interpretation, exceeding the "within the next two activities" requirement). This omission of a second violation undermines the justification's completeness and accuracy, warranting a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
