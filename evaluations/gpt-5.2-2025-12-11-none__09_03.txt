The LLM answer is semantically nearly identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to redacted rows/timestamps in Artefact A, precisely explaining missing data needs (per-event durations from timestamps for average/variability/CI), and staying within the supplied artefacts without guessing. Minor deductions for: (1) structural additions ("1–2." numbering and "Reason (precise):" label), diverging from the ground truth's seamless single-paragraph plain text format per task 3; (2) extraneous detail on Artefact B's specific irrelevance (historical metric for wrong interval), not present in ground truth; (3) phrasing like "to estimate variability" and "or another duration field" (no duration field exists), slightly less concise than "dispersion"; (4) omitting explicit call for "additional raw log entries" while still precise on why. These small differences warrant strict point loss despite overall excellence.
