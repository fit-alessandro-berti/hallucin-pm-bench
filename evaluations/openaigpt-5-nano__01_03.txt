4.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part a) (Decision Points - 50% weight)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two actual decision points (the risk-based conditional skip in Step 4 and the TriVote gate in Step 6) and provides reasonably accurate one-sentence descriptions that align closely with the ground truth in rule and logic (e.g., "at least two approvals" matches the "at least two... record 'Approve'" intent, with minor wording differences like "passes/does not pass" vs. "may advance," which imply the same outcome without exact phrasing). However, it incorrectly includes Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) as a "decision point," fabricating its role as a gate or branch when it is merely an input-generating step with no conditional rule—adding this extraneous and erroneous point deviates significantly from the ground truth's precise identification of *only* the two true branches. This mischaracterization introduces a core inaccuracy, warranting a substantial deduction (partial credit for the correct points, but penalized heavily for the addition and lack of exact numbering/naming like "Risk-based skip" and "“TriVote” approval gate").
  
- **Part b) (Documents List - 50% weight)**: The LLM lists 6 documents in partial correct order of first appearance but omits three critical ones (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow), which are explicitly required as inputs in Step 3—treating them as non-documents or ignoring them is a major hallucination/incompleteness error, as the ground truth mandates *all* required documents (9 total). It correctly sequences the remaining ones (e.g., separating "Offer Sheet 77" from "Signed Offer Sheet 77" and placing ID Matrix Declaration after), but the omissions disrupt the full ordered accuracy and completeness. The unrequested "Notes" section is extraneous (though benign, as it restates process facts without hallucinating absent elements like KYC), but does not offset the list's deficiencies.

Overall, the response captures ~70% of the core content but fails on completeness and precision due to the extra decision point and missing documents, which are not minor—under strict criteria, these reflect significant fidelity loss to the ground truth, pulling the score down from a potential 7-8 to 4.5.
