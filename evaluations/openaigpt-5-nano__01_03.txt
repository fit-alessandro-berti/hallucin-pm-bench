4.0

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM answer identifies the two correct decision points (risk-based skip and TriVote), but makes several issues:
  - It lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check’s output *as* a decision point, rather than focusing on the branching that follows from it (Step 4), which muddies clarity compared to the ground truth.
  - The description of the risk-based skip is wordier and less precise than the ground truth: “If risk ∈ {Low, Medium} and requested-amount ≤ €250,000, skip Step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review); otherwise proceed to Step 5.” This is broadly correct, though less crisp.
  - For TriVote, the rule is essentially accurate, although the answer says "the loan passes when at least two... approve" (“if fewer than two approve, the loan does not pass”), which is basically correct.

**b) Required documents**

- Major error: The LLM omits the three risk scorecards (**Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow**), which are specified as unique documents in the process (Step 3), and required by the ground truth.
- The order for other documents is also incorrect:
  - Deck Memo should only appear for the high-risk or high-amount path, but this is a nuance that can be accepted for the purposes of an exhaustive list.
  - The LLM splits Offer Sheet 77 and Signed Offer Sheet 77 in sequence, as in the process.
- The LLM lists only 6 documents; the process (ground truth) specifies 9.

**Other notes**
- The LLM does not hallucinate any unlisted document types.
- The LLM ignores the instruction to only list — not justify — the documents; its note block is extraneous.
- It omits the explicit answer to “describe its rule in one sentence each” for one of the points, simply stating the Tri-Color-Risk-Check "outputs a risk rating..." instead of stating the branch/decision clearly.

**Scoring rationale**

- -3 points: Severe error in omitting three required documents (the risk scorecards), which are standard and crucial in the process definition.
- -1 point: The decision points are less precisely stated than required and do not strictly follow the instruction for one-sentence-per-decision, with the first item not being a conditional or gate, but an output.
- -1 point: Document order is off, and the approach is less rigorous than the ground truth.

**Total: 4.0**  
(The omissions in the document list are critical flaws in accuracy and completeness. The treatment of decision points is closer, but still not perfectly crisp. There are no hallucinations or grievous process misunderstandings, so a score above total failure is warranted, but this is a strictly sub-passing answer.)
