9.5

- The LLM answer matches the ground truth content-wise for all three answers.
- The LLM uses slightly different wording for answer A1 ("Number of distinct cases: 3 (C123, C456, C789)") compared to the expected ultra-concise form ("3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"). This slightly affects conciseness.
- Bullet points and structure were preserved as requested.
- Overall, only a minor formatting/concision difference. 

Therefore, a very strict evaluation yields a score of **9.5**.
