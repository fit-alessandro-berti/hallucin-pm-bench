The LLM answer fully matches on core correctness (exact top 3 activities by avg waiting time: Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability; verbatim quotes of avg and 95p times from table, no extras like service/throughput/other activities). Structure is crisp memo format ≤150 words (~120 words). Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting issues (e.g., automation for docs/letters, reassignment for assessment), explicitly promise ≥20% cut via calculated targets (20% arithmetic precise, not random).

Deductions (-0.8): Meaningful phrasing/structure differences from ground truth (title/bolding vs plain; full "95th percentile" vs "p95"; calculated new times vs % estimates/"pilot"/"estimated"; fully distinct action wordings despite similar intent). No inventions beyond hypothesized impacts (matches GT's style). Strict but not perfect replica.
