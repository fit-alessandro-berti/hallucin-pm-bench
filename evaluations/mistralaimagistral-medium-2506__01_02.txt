6.0

The LLM answer gets most of the details correct but contains significant omissions and minor inaccuracies:

### Decision Points:

- The answer correctly identifies the **Underwriter Alignment Gate** and the **Amount Threshold Decision**, using the correct terminology.
- It describes escalation to the **Harmonisation Committee** properly.
- **However, it omits the explicit listing of the "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)"** as a distinct, standalone decision point, which is required by the prompt and present in the ground truth. This is a substantial procedural error.
- It places the **Amount Threshold Decision** but does not specify its precise location ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which is noted in the ground truth. This loss of precision is a relevant point deduction.

### Required Documents:

- The LLM answer gives the full, accurate list using correct names, closely matching the ground truth.
- It correctly refrains from adding loan-standard documentation.
- Minor language differences (e.g., parentheses for explanations) but overall term fidelity.

### Other:

- No standard terminology was introduced—this aligns with instructions.
- The answer omits specifying, as the ground truth does, that there is NO need for "credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents." While there is a line ("No additional documents or standard loan terminology are included per your instructions"), it is not explicit enough and drops some points here for completeness.

**Summary of deductions:**
- -2 points for omitting "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" as an explicit decision point.
- -1 for not stating the exact process location for the Amount Threshold Decision.
- -1 for lack of explicit negative statement about standard loan documents.
- -0.5 for very minor language/format differences.
- Final: **6.0** — accurate in many respects, but strict adherence and explicitness were required.
