### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major deductions: ~4.0 points lost)**: The LLM identifies only 2 decision points, omitting the explicit "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" as a distinct decision (vote approve/reject), which is clearly a branching outcome in the ground truth and process flow. Descriptions lack precision: e.g., no mention of the "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" context; uses "Underwriter A" instead of "Senior Underwriter A"; rephrases the alignment condition as "> 2 points" (equivalent but not matching ground truth's "≤ 2" phrasing); omits "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for the amount threshold. These omissions and deviations misrepresent the process flow and terminology, violating the prompt's "exact terminology and flow" instruction.
- **Required Documents (minor deductions: ~1.0 points lost, plus 0.5 for extras)**: List is complete and mostly accurate, matching the prompt's wording closely (e.g., "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template"). However, small phrasing tweaks like "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"; extra bolding/formatting on "NFF"; and unnecessary additions like "(Exactly as stated...)" and the clarifying note at the end introduce unrequested content, straying from a pure list/summary.
- **Overall Structure and Adherence (minor deduction: ~0.5 points lost)**: Adds introductory phrase ("Here’s the summary..."), section headers with "###", and an unsolicited question ("Would you like clarification...?"), which inflate the response beyond the prompt's concise summary/list requirement. No introduction of prohibited standard terminology, but extras dilute fidelity.
- **Strictness Applied**: Even minor phrasing/context gaps (e.g., missing "Senior") and structural additions count as errors per instructions; the core omission of a decision point is a significant failure to fully summarize the process.
