8.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high marks basis)**: Correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B only (Quality_Check ‖ Update_Inventory; Generate_Replenishment_Report ‖ Notify_Procurement). Numbers sets in correct order (1 then 2). No mention of A or C. Confirms exactly two sets implicitly.
- **Weaknesses (point deductions, strict criteria)**:
  - Unnecessary introductory sentence (+extra words not in ground truth): -0.3
  - Sub-numbering tasks *within* sets (1., 2.) misleadingly implies sequence/order rather than pure concurrency: -0.4
  - Added parenthetical explanations ("These tasks are on different branches of...") redundant/unasked for: -0.3
  - Missing ground truth elements: no ‖ symbol (-0.2), no bolding/backticks (-0.1), no descriptive "parallel block" phrasing (-0.1), no explicit "No other tasks..." closing (-0.2).
  - Overall stylistic/structure mismatch to ground truth's concise, formatted list: -0.2
- **Total**: Perfect content (10.0 base) minus 1.8 for strict format/verbosity/exactness errors = 8.2. Semantically near-identical but not verbatim match.
