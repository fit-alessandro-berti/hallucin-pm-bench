9.0

The LLM answer accurately lists the two sets of concurrently executable tasks from Process B, numbers them in order, and includes no extraneous information about Processes A or C. Task names are precise, order matches the process, and sets correspond exactly to the parallel blocks described.

However, the LLM answer lacks the small explanatory details and labeling that are present in the ground truth (e.g., "first parallel block", use of formatting like backticks or bold), and does not explicitly confirm that there are "no other tasks in Process B" that can run in parallel. While this is a minor omission, per the instruction to strictly penalize small errors, this nuance reflects a slight loss of completeness and clarity compared to the ground truth.

Thus, the answer is nearly perfect but not 100% complete in format and detail: 9.0.
