The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks in the specified order, with no factual errors or extraneous information about other processes, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements. Minor deductions for stylistic differences from the ground truth (e.g., lacking descriptive labels like "first parallel block," use of "and" instead of "â€–," no code-style backticks, and absence of the confirmatory sentence), but these do not impact correctness or completeness under strict evaluation.
