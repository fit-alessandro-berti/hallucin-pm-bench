The LLM answer is highly accurate and precise, correctly identifying the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A and appropriately dismissing Artefact B's irrelevance with relevant detail on why it doesn't provide cycle times or statistics. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., not explicitly naming "start_time / complete_time" columns or stating "additional raw log entries required," and marginally longer structure diverging from ground truth's ultra-concise opener), but no factual errors or guesses—excellent adherence to the task's "one short paragraph" requirement under strict evaluation.
