### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major deductions)**: The LLM correctly identifies the core three decision points from the ground truth (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval). However, it incorrectly adds an extraneous fourth point (Quick KYC Verification as a "pass/reject" decision), which is not listed in the ground truth and inflates the summary beyond the process's explicit branching gates. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "Proceed to NFC" vs. "continue"; "Route to" vs. "send to") add slight inaccuracies, warranting significant point loss for strict fidelity.
- **Required Documents (moderate deductions)**: The list is complete and uses exact names from the prompt, but phrasing deviates from the ground truth in small but noticeable ways (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"). The LLM omits the ground truth's explanatory note on excluded standard documents, reducing completeness.
- **Overall Structure and Adherence**: The response is well-organized and avoids introducing forbidden standard terminology, but the extra decision point and phrasing inconsistencies prevent a higher score under strict evaluation criteria. No catastrophic errors, but deviations accumulate to pull below excellent.
