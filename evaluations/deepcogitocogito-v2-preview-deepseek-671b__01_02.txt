6.0

The LLM answer mostly follows the process and requirements, but several notable deviations from the ground truth require a significant point deduction:

**Major issues:**
- The LLM adds a **KYC decision point** that is not identified as a decision point in the ground truth. The ground truth does not treat "Quick KYC Verification" as a formal branching decision point, but as a verification/precondition, and focuses decision points strictly on the branching/gate nodes.
- The LLM incorrectly numbers **4 decision points**. The ground truth has only **3**, specifically: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval.
- The LLM's description of the location/timing of decision points:
  - Puts the Underwriter Alignment Gate after KYC rather than specifically after the Dual Underwriter Split.
  - Does not clearly state that the Amount Threshold Decision happens *after* the Neighbourhood Feedback Check, which is precise in the ground truth ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
- The LLM slightly expands/changes some document titles and descriptions, e.g.:
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" should be just "≤ 3 months".
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" is more verbose than the ground truth ("pay-stub/tax slip").
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" instead of just "Community Impact Statement (CIS)".
  - The LLM correctly includes all document names but adds some unnecessary detail/wording, sometimes from the prompt rather than the document list.
- Does not note **explicitly** (as the ground truth does) that no other standard documents are required (minor, but reflected in total strictness).

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer fundamentally understands and conveys the unique elements of the process.
- It accurately lists the required documents (with minor naming differences).
- It avoids standard loan terminology and respects the flow's special terms.

**Summary:**  
Strict marking requires all these divergences (KYC as decision point, extra/altered wording in documents, not specifying branching locations correctly, and omission of the negative statement about standard documents) to result in significant point loss, but the answer is not grossly incorrect, so a 6.0/10 reflects substantial accuracy with several non-trivial errors.
