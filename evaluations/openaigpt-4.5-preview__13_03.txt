The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on Q1 (exact count of 1). For Q2, it correctly identifies the core issue of small sample size leading to potential over- or under-representation but omits key nuances: quantitative details on sample scope (14 events/3 cases/<2 hours), frequency volatility (e.g., 0-7% swing), wide confidence intervals for rare events, and risks from near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check,” “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) affecting string vs. fuzzy matching. These omissions reduce depth, though the response stays concise (92 words) and relevant. Minor deduction for incomplete coverage of misestimation pitfalls.
