3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the prompt and ground truth but contains critical errors warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Factual Inaccuracy in Data (Major Deduction)**: The memo incorrectly states Legal Approval's SLA as 300s (claiming 200% overage), while the table and ground truth clearly show 600s (+300s excess). This invents a false metric, violating the "ground every sentence in the data supplied; do NOT invent" rule. Percentages for SLA overages (e.g., 200%, 100%, 25%) and waiting time proportions (e.g., 67%, 80%) are derived calculations not provided in the table, introducing unsubstantiated metrics.

- **Differences in Quantification**: Ground truth uses absolute excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) directly tied to data; LLM mixes throughput with invented percentages, reducing precision and fidelity.

- **Structural and Content Deviations**: Memo format differs (e.g., bolded "MEMORANDUM" header vs. ground truth's simple *To/From/Subject*); lacks ground truth elements like total cases (4,805), sample period ("April 2025"), and projected impact (35% cycle time reduction). Word count â‰ˆ140 (close to 150 target, minor positive). FROM line mismatches ("Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office").

- **Recommendations**: Bullet-point format correct and data-driven (e.g., citing cases/wait times), but specifics diverge entirely from ground truth (e.g., "parallel review lanes" vs. "rule-based pre-checks"), missing the exact concrete actions. This reduces alignment without violating the prompt directly, but amplifies differences.

- **Strengths (Minor Credit)**: Correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times. Stays within table data for other metrics (e.g., throughput/waiting times, cases). No extraneous activities/metrics.

Overall, the core identification is sound, but the SLA invention and invented metrics create substantial divergence, justifying a score below 5.0. Small errors like percentages compound to reflect poor data fidelity.
