8.0

The LLM answer provides the correct overall answer ("No") and correctly identifies the reason for non-compliance (violation of rule 3: Notify_Authorities occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review). Each rule is addressed individually, and the reasoning is accurate for all rules.

However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer is less precise in its justification structure:
- It does not explicitly mention "NA must wait until *both* QE and RA are finished" in Rule 3, omitting the full logic behind the violation.  
- The justification for each satisfied rule could be expanded for clarity, as in the ground truth.

Although the essential assessment is correct, these small omissions and less structured formatting reflect a minor loss of points. Thus, the score is 8.0.
