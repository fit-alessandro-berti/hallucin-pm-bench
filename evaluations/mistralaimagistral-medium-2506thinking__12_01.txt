The LLM answer accurately identifies the fact as incorrect, with correct analysis per case (reversed ordering in 1001 and 1003, absence in 1002 disproving "always"). It cites relevant cases and activities, aligning closely with the ground truth's evidence and conclusion. Minor deductions for slight imprecision ("converse is true" overlooks non-immediacy in case 1003), verbosity beyond the prompt's "short justification" request, and extraneous structure (e.g., sections, "Authorities" phrasing), but no factual errors.
