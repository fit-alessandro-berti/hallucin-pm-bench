The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate, systematically analyzes all relevant cases (1001, 1002, 1003), and provides accurate justifications based on the event log. It highlights that Update_Inventory always comes before Authorize_Refund (when both occur), and notes that in case 1002, Update_Inventory does not occur, invalidating the “always” qualifier.

**Minor errors that warrant a point deduction:**
- In Case 1003, the LLM implies that Update_Inventory “appears before Authorize_Refund (with another activity, Quality_Check, in between),” but doesn't explicitly state that “Authorize_Refund” does not immediately precede “Update_Inventory,” which is a key part of the original claim.
- The LLM could be clearer regarding the “immediately before” part, as it focuses more on the order rather than the adjacency of activities.

**Summary:** The answer is highly accurate and justified, but minor imprecision on “immediacy” versus just ordering results in a 1.0 point deduction.
