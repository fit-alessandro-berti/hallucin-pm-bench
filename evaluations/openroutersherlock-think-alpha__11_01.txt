8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h p95; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quoting metrics verbatim from the table without mentioning service times, throughput, or extraneous activities—fully matching ground truth on correctness and no unwarranted content (10/10 here). It stays under 150 words (98) and provides one concrete, data-driven action per activity, each logically tied to waiting-time bottlenecks and promising ≥20% reduction (e.g., ≥25-30% via automation/prioritization), aligning with relevance criteria (9/10; actions are relevant but differ in specifics from ground truth, e.g., LLM's "automated reminders at 24h/72h" vs. ground truth's "24h escalation triggers"; "digital notifications" vs. "e-signature letters"; "rules-based routing" vs. "rules-engine pre-classification"—not identical, deducting for non-exact match under strictness).

Minor deductions for format differences (full memo with invented date/subject vs. ground truth's concise list; 0.3 points) and extras like calculated reduced times (e.g., "≤27.4h") and closing sentence (potentially "inventing" minor unsupported projections, though mathematically derived; 0.2 points). Overall, high fidelity but not pixel-perfect to ground truth phrasing/structure, warranting a strict but strong score.
