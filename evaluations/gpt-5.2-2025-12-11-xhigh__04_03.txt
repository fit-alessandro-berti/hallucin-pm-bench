The LLM answer is fully accurate, correctly identifies "No" compliance due to the exact same Rule 3 violation (NA before RA), satisfies all other rules with precise references matching the ground truth reasoning, and provides a short justification per the prompt. Minor stylistic differences (bullets vs. table; phrasing like "occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review" vs. "before RA is completed") do not constitute errors, as they convey identical semantics without omission or inaccuracy. All rules explicitly addressed once each, with no deviations.
