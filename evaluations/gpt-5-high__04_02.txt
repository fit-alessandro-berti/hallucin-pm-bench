The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all rule statuses, overall result, and core violation identifications. Justifications are accurate, concise (all â‰¤20 words), and factually correct, with minor phrasing differences (e.g., R2 emphasizes "not after" vs. GT's ">2 days"; R5 uses "subsequent steps" vs. specific events; R1 includes extra dates/approvers). No factual errors, but slight deviations in precision and lack of bold formatting per prompt deduct 0.8 points under strict evaluation.
