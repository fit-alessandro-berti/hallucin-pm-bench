9.0

Rationale:
- The LLM answer gives the correct verdict for all six rules and the overall result.
- Justifications for each rule are correct in substance, and there are no outright errors in the determinations.
- Minor fault: R2’s explanation is less precise than the ground truth’s: the ground truth highlights that Ship_Goods is more than 2 days before the final approval (should be "after the last required approval" which, post-change, is 07-Mar), but the LLM’s wording “before new Manager Approval” is confusingly expressed. The wording suggests sequence rather than the intended temporal check, even though its conclusion is ultimately correct.
- In R5, the answer and reasoning are correct and clear, matching the ground truth.
- Wording for R1, R4, R6 is clear and accurate.
- The only real deduction is for the slightly muddled justification wording in R2, and also a minor excess in wording for some justifications (~22 words for R2), violating the “≤ 20 words” requirement.
- No other material errors.

Thus: 9.0 for correct analysis and determination, with a minor penalty due to justification precision/format.
