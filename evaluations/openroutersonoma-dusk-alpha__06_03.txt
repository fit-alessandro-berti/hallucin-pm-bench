3.0

The LLM answer provided correctly identifies the first set of concurrent tasks in Process B ("Quality_Check and Update_Inventory"). However, it fails to identify the second, equally important parallel set ("Generate_Replenishment_Report" â€– "Notify_Procurement"), which is explicitly marked as the second parallel split in the process. This is a significant omission, as the prompt asks for each set of concurrently executable tasks. Moreover, the answer lacks explicit numbering to correspond with the order of parallel blocks in the process, as requested in the prompt and demonstrated in the ground truth.

Due to the omission of the second set and lack of structure, the score must be severely penalized, resulting in a 3.0.
