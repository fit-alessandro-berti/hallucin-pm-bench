4.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the first set of concurrent tasks but completely omits the second set (Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement), failing to list all required sets as per the prompt and ground truth. It also lacks the structural formatting, descriptive labels, parallel notation (â€–), and concluding statement about no other parallel tasks, resulting in significant incompleteness and deviation from the ground truth. Under strict evaluation, this partial accuracy warrants a low score.
