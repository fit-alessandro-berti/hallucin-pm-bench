The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names and comma separation, matching the ground truth content perfectly. However, it omits the required numbering (1., 2., 3.) specified in the prompt and present in the ground truth, which is a format violation warranting a deduction despite semantic accuracy. Under utmost strictness, this small but explicit formatting error results in a significant point loss from 10.0.
