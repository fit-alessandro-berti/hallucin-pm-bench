**Score: 8.0**

**Justification:**

The LLM Answer is overall correct and matches the ground truth in essence, but there are a couple of small but significant issues, which, under the utmost strictness, warrant notable point deductions:

**Positives:**
- Q1 is correctly answered (“Yes”).
- Q2 provides a valid minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. This matches the ground truth.
- The explanation correctly reasons that T5 can fire before T3 and covers the enabling of T5 while P2’s token persists.

**Negatives:**
1. **Markings Notation:** Unlike the ground truth, the LLM answer does not provide explicit markings at each step, which is helpful for strict, precise validation in Petri net analysis. Omission of this detail removes clarity about the state after each transition.
2. **Aftermath of T5:** The LLM answer does not explicitly state that T3 becomes disabled after T5 consumes the token in P2, as the ground truth does. This is an important detail in process-mining and Petri net analysis to demonstrate understanding of how the net's state changes after synchronizing transitions.
3. **Too verbose on steps & slight irrelevancy:** The LLM’s explanation is slightly wordier and less focused than an optimal ≤120-word analyst response (though it doesn't exceed the word limit).
4. **Notational inconsistency:** The LLM says, “T2 and then T7 fire on the left branch, moving the token from P1 to P3 to P4.” For utmost strictness, this could be interpreted as slightly imprecise, as the token is moved first to P3 (via T2), then to P4 (via T7) in separate steps.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is correct in content and reasoning but lacks the explicit marking steps and the important note about T3’s disabled state after T5. These omissions, while minor, are significant in a formal Petri net analysis and should result in a loss of at least 2 points.
