The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), demonstrating T5 firing before T3 with a valid explanation of token flow. It stays under 120 words and accurately describes the enabling conditions (tokens in P2 and P5). Minor deductions for omitting formal markings (which ground truth uses for precise verification) and not noting T5's consumption of P2 (disabling T3 afterward), reducing completeness but not correctness.
