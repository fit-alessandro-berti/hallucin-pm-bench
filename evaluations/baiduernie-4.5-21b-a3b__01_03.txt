3.5

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision Point Summary**

- The LLM answer lists *many* non-existent decision points (e.g., completeness check after application, assignment of deck reviewer, requesting documents from applicant), which are not “decision points” by the precise process definition. Almost every process step is listed as a decision, which is incorrect.
- Only two *actual* decision points exist per the process: (1) the risk-based conditional skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check, and (2) the TriVote approval gate. The LLM finds both (albeit with some confusion on the TriVote rule), but overloads the answer with irrelevant “decisions.”
- The rule for TriVote is misstated: “requires no third approval if risk is Low/Medium”—this is factually incorrect, as all cases require up to three votes; any two approvals suffice, regardless of risk.
- The risk-based skip (step 4/5) is stated accurately.
- Incorrect assumptions include: “Manual-Underwriting-Review: Requires a Deck Memo documenting a manual review of collateral/applicant circumstances” (the specifics of the content are invented).
- Overall, major points off for multiple invented or mischaracterized decision points and slightly muddled rules.

**b) Document List**

- Misses the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), despite their centrality to the process and their explicit input into the Tri-Color-Risk-Check. This is a severe omission.
- Misses “Signed Offer Sheet 77” as a required document (only lists “Offer Sheet 77”).
- Correctly includes Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025, but in the case of “Offer Sheet 77” does not separate signed vs unsigned occurrences.
- The ordering is mostly correct for what is listed, but the incompleteness of the document list is a critical flaw.
- Does not introduce hallucinated KYC/AML/credit-bureau docs.

**Scoring Justification**

- Major factual errors in part (a): inclusion of fictitious decision points, incorrect TriVote rule, excessive editorializing.
- Severe omissions in part (b): missing three Scorecards and “Signed Offer Sheet 77.”
- The answer shows partial understanding of the process flow but does not faithfully summarize or list per instructions.

**Net: 3.5/10 — Significant flaws in both accuracy and completeness, but not a total hallucination.**
