### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part (a) Accuracy**: The ground truth identifies exactly two decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate), each described precisely in one sentence. The LLM answer severely deviates by fabricating 7 additional "decision points" that do not exist in the process (e.g., checking application completeness, post-TriVote greenlight/denial, etc.), misdescribes the TriVote rule by incorrectly adding a risk-dependent condition ("requires no third approval if risk is Low/Medium"), and buries the two real points amid irrelevant steps. This introduces hallucinations and ignores the prompt's focus on "gates or conditional branches." Significant point loss for extraneous content, factual errors, and failure to limit to one sentence per actual point. (Score: 1.0/5.0)
  
- **Part (b) Accuracy**: The ground truth lists 9 documents in first-appearance order, including the three scorecards as inputs to step 3 (explicitly required) and distinguishing the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" (step 7) from the "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (step 8). The LLM misses all three scorecards (critical omission, as they are integral documents), fails to separate the signed/unsigned offer sheets, omits the signed variant entirely, and lists only 5 items in partially incorrect order (e.g., Deck Memo appears after scorecards in truth). No hallucinations of absent items like KYC/AML, but the incompleteness and ordering errors are substantial. (Score: 2.0/5.0)

- **Overall**: Strict deduction for small errors (e.g., incomplete document list) compounded by major issues like invented decision points and rule alterations, resulting in low fidelity to the ground truth. The answer shows partial recall of the process but fails to adhere closely to the prompt's requirements.
