The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely matches the ground truth. The compliance decision (“No”) is correct, and the justification references each rule, specifying which are satisfied or violated, and provides clear reasoning:

- Rule 1: Correctly identifies proper order and occurrence of QE and RA.
- Rule 2: Correctly notes VP is after QE and RA, as required for severity = High.
- Rule 3: Correctly points out NA occurs after QE but before RA, violating the rule.
- Rule 4: Correctly indicates CC occurs at the right time.

The justification is clear, complete, and directly tied to the rules, just like the ground truth.

Minor stylistic and formatting differences (for example, using checkmarks, headings, and a slightly less formal presentation) compared to the tabular format of the gold standard cause a very slight deduction, as requested per strictness.
