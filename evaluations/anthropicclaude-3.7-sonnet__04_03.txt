The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying "No" compliance due to the sole violation of Rule 3, with precise reasoning for all rules matching the ground truth's assessments and logic. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: non-table format for justification (ground truth uses a structured table), slightly more verbose phrasing in places (e.g., explicit "exactly once each" for Rule 1 vs. ground truth's concise "appears once"), and an introductory header/summary sentence not present in the ground truth, which deviates from the prompt's request for a "short justification." No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes these presentational variances.
