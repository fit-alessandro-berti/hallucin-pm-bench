The LLM answer is predominantly a lengthy, disorganized internal reasoning stream (over 1,000 words) rather than a crisp executive memo â‰¤150 words. It correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) and quotes the waiting times accurately in its draft snippet. However, it fails to produce a complete, standalone memo: the output cuts off mid-draft, includes unnecessary table recaps and deliberations on ranking metrics (e.g., debating avg vs. 95th percentile), and omits a polished structure like headers or word count adherence. Actions are vaguely concrete but lack true data-driven specificity (e.g., no references to pilots, estimates, or evidence as in ground truth; instead, generic suggestions like "implement automated..."). Minor errors like incomplete sentences and extraneous activity mentions compound the mismatch, rendering it non-responsive to the prompt.
