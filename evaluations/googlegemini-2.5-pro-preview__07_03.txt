6.5

ADDED TASKS:  
- The LLM listed the correct tasks, but failed to use the required dash bullet (“-”) before each entry, which is a requirement when compared with the ground truth.

REMOVED TASKS:  
- The LLM again omitted the dash bullet.

GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES:  
- The LLM wrote “exclusiveGateway” and “parallelGateway” (the XML tag names), while the ground truth requires “exclusive” and “parallel”.
- The LLM omitted the dash bullet before each entry, as required.

These are small but significant differences in formatting and level of abstraction (“exclusiveGateway” vs “exclusive”). The answer otherwise covers all and only the required differences. Significant point loss is warranted due to these multiple small but strict violations.
