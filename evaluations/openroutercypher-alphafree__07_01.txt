The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all factual changes under the required headings, using exact task names from the XML `name` attributes and the gateway ID with precise type change. Core content matches the ground truth closely. However, it loses points for minor differences: omission of element IDs for added/removed tasks (present in ground truth), lack of version specifiers "(v1)" and "(v2)" for the gateway change, slightly different bullet formatting (- vs. *), and plain headings instead of bolded ones. The extra note in ground truth is not required by the prompt, so no deduction there. Strict evaluation penalizes these details as omissions of precision, but the answer remains highly accurate overall.
