The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, matching the core content of the ground truth. However, it incurs deductions for several small but notable differences under strict evaluation: (1) unnecessary title/header ("**Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment**"), which adds extraneous information not present in the ground truth; (2) descriptive phrases like "(after *Parallel Split #1*):" that go beyond the ground truth's concise labeling ("first parallel block"); (3) bullet-point formatting with bold task names instead of inline backticks and the ‖ symbol for parallelism; (4) an extra concluding sentence explaining the sets, which is not in the ground truth and slightly interpretive; (5) omission of the ground truth's closing statement confirming no other parallel tasks, potentially implying incompleteness. These formatting, structural, and additive deviations reduce the score from a perfect match, reflecting strict penalties for even minor variances in precision and brevity.
