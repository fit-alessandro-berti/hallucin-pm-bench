9.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth, correctly identifying both sets of concurrently executable tasks, preserving the order, and clearly presenting each set. However, there is a slight loss of points due to minor deviation in format and phrasing:  
- The LLM uses slightly different set labeling and doesn't explicitly use "No other tasks..." to close out (which was present in the ground truth).  
- The answer repeats some explanatory wording without being strictly necessary given the prompt's instruction for strictness and brevity.

These are small but present differences, thus the response merits a 9.0.
