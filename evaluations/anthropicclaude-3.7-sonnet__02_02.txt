9.5

Q1: Correct ("3").  
Q2: Correct ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order").  
Q3: The LLM answer distinct activities are:  
- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock

This matches the ground truth, and the list is alphabetically ordered as required.

Minor issue:  
The activities (Q3) are written as **Arrange_Delivery** and **Check_Stock**, with underscores, which matches the data and the ground truth formatting (which uses underscores). So there is no formatting error.

Largely correct. One extremely minor stylistic difference is that the ground truth uses markdown line breaks ("<br>") for Q3, while the LLM uses a list format—however, the prompt does not specify a format for the answer, just that the activities appear one per line and are alphabetically ordered, which is satisfied.

No factual, spelling, or ordering errors. The answer is technically perfect. Because the instruction says to punish "even small errors", a 9.5 is given since, arguably, the LLM adds mild explanatory context (e.g., “precedes Ship_Order in case C002”) in Q3 when the question only calls for a list, which could be seen as "extra output" or justifiable commentary.

In summary:  
- All answers are exact matches to the ground truth.
- Very slight addition of context not required.

Strictly, this is a 9.5/10.
