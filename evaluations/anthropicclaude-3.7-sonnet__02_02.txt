9.0

The LLM answer is factually precise across all questions, matching the ground truth content exactly for Q1 (3 cases), Q2 (exact sequence), and Q3 (correct distinct activities: Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock, listed alphabetically). No missing, fabricated, or incorrect elements. However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.0 point total for minor deviations in presentation: extra explanatory parentheticals in Q3, unrequested case listings in Q1, and overall Markdown structuring/headers not present in the concise ground truth format. These are small extras but warrant a significant (though not severe) loss per instructions.
