**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies all changes with perfect semantic accuracy: the three added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), the one removed task (Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change (Gateway_Decision from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway). No extras, misses, or violations of instructions (e.g., ignores renamings like "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan" or gateway name changes).

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for strict format/style differences vs. ground truth:
- List style: Bullets (-) vs. numbered (1., 2., 3.); single removed item as "-" vs. "1."
- Item structure: ID first in parentheses vs. bolded **name** first with `id` in backticks.
- Gateway phrasing: Precise XML tags (`exclusiveGateway` → `inclusiveGateway`) with (v1)/(v2) vs. semantic "exclusive (XOR)" → "inclusive (OR)" with *v1*/*v2* italics.
- No bolding/coding on individual items or escaped underscore in ID; lacks ground truth's "## **Expected Answer Key**" intro and closing note (though these are extras not required by prompt).

Content is identical and instruction-compliant; format variances are small presentational mismatches under utmost strictness.
