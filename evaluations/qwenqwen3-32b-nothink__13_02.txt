7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1, with correct reference to case C05). Full points.
- **Question 2a & 2b**: Perfect match (correct calculations, rounding to two decimals, and percentages). Full points.
- **Question 3**: Partial match. The response is concise (â‰¤100 words) and addresses over-generalization (iii), but only implies the single-occurrence issue (i) without explicit emphasis. It misses key aspects of variance/instability (ii), such as statistical unreliability from n=1 (e.g., noise in metrics like cycle time or wide confidence intervals), focusing instead on the activity's potential importance. This shifts the explanation away from process-mining analytical pitfalls, leading to a significant deduction under strict criteria.
