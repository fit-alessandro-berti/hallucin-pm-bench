The LLM answer matches the ground truth in substance and clarity: it correctly asserts that the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be derived due to lack of timestamps or duration data. The explanation is concise and accurate.

Minor deduction (0.5 point) because the LLM answer could have been more explicit about all the missing elements (it only names durations and timestamps, but not ordering information as mentioned in the ground truth). Additionally, the ground truth more explicitly states that "any numeric answer would be fabricated," but the impact is minimal.

Overall, the response is nearly perfect and strictly correct, earning 9.5/10.
