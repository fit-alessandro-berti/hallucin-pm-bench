The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) for Q2, demonstrating T5 firing before T3 without issues in the core logic. However, it incurs significant deductions for: (1) exceeding the 120-word limit (≈144 words total, vs. ground truth's concise <100); (2) lacking explicit markings (M1–M5) that ground truth uses to clearly validate states; (3) imprecise phrasing in Q1 ("earlier or simultaneously"—simultaneous firing is impossible; "not prioritized"—misrepresents non-deterministic enabling); and (4) redundant/verbose steps (e.g., emphasizing post-T5 disablement, already implied). These accumulate as small but notable errors under strict criteria, reducing alignment with the precise, succinct ground truth.
