The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false with "No" and provides a concise, one-paragraph justification citing the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11) as the ground truth, accurately refuting the "always follows" claim by noting the precedence and absence of prior Receive_Order. The only minor deduction is for slightly less precise phrasing on C005 (stating "no prior Receive_Order" rather than explicitly "never contains Receive_Order at all"), which omits the full absence in the case but does not alter the validity of the counterexample; under utmost strictness, this warrants a small point loss despite the near-identical structure and completeness.
