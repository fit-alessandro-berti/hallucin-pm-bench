The LLM answer does correctly conclude that the required metrics (average cycle time of "Approve Invoice", standard deviation, 95% confidence interval) cannot be computed, given that all rows and timestamps are redacted from the event log, and that the KPI provided in Artefact B relates to a different interval. The explanation is thorough and repeatedly justifies *why* no computation is possibleâ€”referencing both the absence of data and the irrelevant nature of the KPI.

However, significant deductions must be made for the following reasons:

- The answer is excessively verbose, circling around the point with multiple rephrasings. The prompt asks for one short paragraph if no calculation is possible; the LLM's answer is much longer than necessary and not as concise as the ground truth.
- The ground truth leads with a clear, one-word verdict ("Impossible") and presents the reasoning in a direct, non-repetitive way. The LLM answer, in contrast, delays the decisive statement and buries it in extended discussion.
- The LLM occasionally speculates on process mining conventions and possibilities (discussing what the cycle time "might" mean, referencing typical definitions, and so on), when the strict grading criterion is to avoid such speculation and focus on the direct facts of the artifacts.

Therefore, while the final justification is reasonably correct and accurate, the unnecessarily length and indirectness, plus mild speculation, warrant a deduction of 2 points for strictness.
