### Evaluation Rationale
**Question 1 (Perfect match: +5/5 points):** The LLM correctly identifies exactly one occurrence, aligning verbatim with the ground truth count.

**Question 2 (Partial match, major deviations: +0/5 points):** The LLM's response (98 words) is under the limit but lacks the ground truth's precision and data-driven focus. It omits critical elements like the sample's exact scale (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), quantitative volatility (e.g., 0%â€“7% frequency swing, wide confidence intervals), rare-event sampling error, and string-matching pitfalls from near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). Instead, it introduces unsubstantiated speculation (selection bias, time variations, missing rejections), violating the "no speculation" rule and diverging from the ground truth's emphasis on sampling unreliability and matching distortions. These omissions and additions represent substantial errors, warranting near-total deduction under strict criteria.
