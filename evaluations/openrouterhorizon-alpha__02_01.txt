The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list, as this activity does appear as the first event in case C-77 (per the event log and rationale). This is a clear factual error in identifying activities that never start a case, warranting a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria, despite the overall similarity.
