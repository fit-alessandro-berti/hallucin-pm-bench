8.0

The LLM answer is correct for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, for Q5, it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as an activity that never appears as the first event of any case, whereas in the fragment for case "C-77", "Quality_Check" is the first and only event for that case. Including a false positive in Q5 is a significant error, warranting a deduction. Nonetheless, all other answers are accurate, so the score is 8.0.
