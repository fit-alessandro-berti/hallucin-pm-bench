The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall inaccuracy of the FACT ("No") and provides a solid justification by citing the two key counterexamples (C002 and C004) with accurate sequences and intervening activities, directly disproving the "always" claim. It also briefly notes C001 as compliant, aligning with the ground truth. However, under strict evaluation, the response is incomplete: it omits analysis of C003 (which complies, as per the ground truth), failing to provide a fully case-by-case verification of all relevant instances in the log (four cases total). This represents a small but notable lapse in meticulousness, as the ground truth exhaustively covers every case in a structured table for comprehensiveness. The narrative format is clear but less organized than the tabular one, adding minor divergence. These issues warrant a deduction, but the core logic and evidence usage are strong and unaltered.
