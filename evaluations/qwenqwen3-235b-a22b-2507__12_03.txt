9.0

The LLM answer almost perfectly matches the ground truth in correctness, structure, and reference to evidence. It:
- Correctly answers "No".
- Cites both C002 and C004 as counterexamples, accurately describing the sequence and explicitly explaining the violation.
- Acknowledges C001 as conforming.
- Offers clear justification and references to activity order.

Minor deductions:
- Omits reference to C003, which also conforms to the rule (the ground truth makes a point to show both positive and negative cases). Explicitly listing all cases would have made the answer maximally thorough.
- The LLM's summary slightly merges justification rather than using a case-by-case/table format, hence slightly less structured than the ground truth.

Otherwise, all critical evidence and logic are included. Therefore: **9.0**.
