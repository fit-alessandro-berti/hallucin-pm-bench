**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Vocabulary (perfect match, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Activities match exactly.
- **Structure (+0.5 partial)**: Correct RACI matrix format (rows/columns as specified). However, unwarranted extras: title ("**RACI Matrix: Order-to-Cash Workflow**"), legend (full block), plural "Activities" header vs. singular "Activity", role headers include unnecessary abbreviations/parentheticals "(AM)" etc., inconsistent/excess bolding on all activity names and some cells.
- **RACI Content (major deductions, -6.5)**: Significant mismatches vs. ground truth (9/24 cells wrong, errors in 5/6 rows; only "Order Vetting" near-match ignoring minor A/R order swap):
  | Activity | Mismatched Cells |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Receive Application | CO (I vs C), IT (C vs I) |
  | KYC Review | AM (C vs A), FC (I vs C) |
  | Order Vetting | Minor (A/R vs R/A order) |
  | Payment Clearance | AM (C vs A), CO (I vs C) |
  | Record Update | AM (I vs C), FC (I vs C) |
  | Notify Customer | AM (R vs R/A; missing A) |
  - Fails rubric: RACI does not fully reflect narrative/ground truth (e.g., misses AM as A in KYC/Payment/Notify; incorrect C/I swaps; no A implied for Record).
- **Overall**: ~37% cell accuracy, plus formatting/unwarranted content violations. Strict policy demands near-exact match; multiple small errors (swaps, missing A, extras) cause outsized penalty. Not usable as ground truth substitute.
