The LLM answer accurately identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h p95; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quoting figures verbatim from the table. It stays under 150 words (~120), omits all prohibited content (no service times, throughput, or extra activities), and provides relevant, data-driven actions promising â‰¥20% reductions (e.g., pilots/benchmarks/historical data as support). Minor deductions for phrasing variances in actions (e.g., "automated reminders and digital upload links" vs. ground truth's "automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation triggers"; "same-day automated emailing" vs. "same-day e-signature letters"; slight overestimation like "over 50%" vs. "30%") and added memo structure (header/closing) not in ground truth, introducing non-essential elements despite overall fidelity.
