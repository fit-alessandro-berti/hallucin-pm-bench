The LLM answer is entirely invalid: it fabricates non-existent `<extensionElements>` in `Task_CreateRecord` (attempting invalid deletion), incorrectly alters `Task_GrantAccess` (already a `serviceTask`, not `userTask`), presents a malformed non-unified multi-hunk diff unrelated to SLA compliance, and provides an irrelevant rationale ignoring the cumulative due-date exceedance fixed precisely by the ground truth's single-attribute change.
