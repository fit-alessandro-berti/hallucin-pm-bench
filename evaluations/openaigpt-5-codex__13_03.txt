7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Exact match (both identify one occurrence). No deductions.
- **Question 2**: The response correctly identifies the small sample size (three cases, single morning) as a source of misestimation and notes risks of over/under-representation in the full log, staying under 120 words (78 words). However, it omits key ground truth elements: quantitative sample details (14 events, <2 hours), statistical impacts (e.g., frequency swinging 0-7%, wide confidence intervals, rare event sampling error), and crucially, the distortion from near-synonym activities (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) that could lead to mismatched counts via strict vs. fuzzy matching. These omissions reduce depth and completeness, warranting a ~30% deduction for strict criteria.
