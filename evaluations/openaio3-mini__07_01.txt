6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the prompt's requirements for only listing differences without speculation. Headings match the prompt exactly (using â€¢ bullets). However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions apply for format and presentation deviations from the ground truth:

- **Added/Removed tasks**: LLM includes full XML snippets (e.g., `<task id="check_vip" name="Check Customer VIP Status"/>`), which adds unnecessary XML structure not present in the ground truth's concise format (name + id in parentheses). This violates "list **only** the factual differences" by quoting extraneous XML details, warranting a -2.0 deduction.
- **Gateway type changes**: LLM's phrasing and full XML inclusion (e.g., repeating the unchanged `name="Warranty Valid?"` attribute) differ from the ground truth's succinct "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)". No version labels (v1/v2) are used, and bolding/emphasis is absent, leading to a -1.0 deduction for imprecise, verbose reporting.
- **Overall structure**: Bulleted lists use - instead of * as in ground truth; no trailing note like "(No other differences should be reported.)"; headings lack bolding. These minor formatting inconsistencies compound to -0.5.

Content accuracy is high (no errors or omissions), but the stricter ground truth alignment criteria penalize all deviations, resulting in 6.5/10.0.
