**9.7**

The LLM answer is factually perfect, correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate across all cases, cites precise timestamps from the data (superior to ground truth's erroneous "lines 11 & 14" for case 1003, where Update_Inventory is actually line 12), and addresses the "immediately before" and "always" aspects implicitly/accurately. Justification is short, evidence-based with case IDs and activities.

Minor deductions (-0.3 total) for:
- Stylistic differences: "not accurate" vs "inaccurate"; lacks "**Short verdict:**" and "**Justification (evidence-based)**" headers; uses "-" bullets and quotes vs "*" bullets and backticks.
- Case 1002 adds irrelevant (though true) "after Inspect_Item" detail not in ground truth.
- No explicit "so 'always' is already disproved" phrasing for case 1002 (implied but not verbatim). 

No factual/content errors; exceeds ground truth in citation precision.
