The LLM answer correctly identifies the "Collect Equipment" task as the target for modification and provides a unified diff with a one-sentence rationale, but loses significant points for proposing an incorrect dueDate value (P3D instead of P2D, failing to align with the implied 3-day SLA resolution), a non-minimal diff format that includes extraneous lines and file headers not matching the single-hunk expectation, and a rationale that introduces unsubstantiated "40% critical path" math without referencing the contractual SLA or avoiding new activities as in the ground truth.
