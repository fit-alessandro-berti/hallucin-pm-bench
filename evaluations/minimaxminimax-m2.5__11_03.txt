8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth. It accurately quantifies excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) using table data. Structure uses paragraphs for analysis and bullets exclusively for recommendations, aligning with instructions. However, deductions for: lack of professional memo header (To/From/Subject); invented elements like case volume sum (>2,100), combined 660s excess, and "main bottleneck" (not grounded); speculative recommendation metrics (e.g., "halve," "~30%," "30% reduction") differing from ground truth's inventions; no closing projection; minor formatting differences (no bolding, different bullet style/order); slightly interpretive intro language. Substance strong (90% match), but strictness for format/inventions yields 8.0.
