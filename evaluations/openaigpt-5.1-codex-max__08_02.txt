The LLM answer is correct (Yes for Q1, identical minimal sequence T1→T2→T7→T4→T5 demonstrating T5 before T3), concise (under 120 words), and substantively matches the ground truth explanation (P2 token preserved via P1 branch). Minor deductions for: (1) lacking explicit Q1/Q2 labels and structured numbering; (2) sequence presented as explanatory bullets rather than pure ordered list of names; (3) omitting precise marking notations (M₁={P1,P2}, etc.) for state verification; (4) slightly less formal phrasing without "subsequently disabled" confirmation. No factual errors.
