7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Statuses**: 5/6 rules match exactly (R1, R3, R4, R5, R6). R2 wrong (Compliant vs. Violated) – major error, as it misidentifies "last required approval" (ignores post-change Manager_Approval on 07-Mar, making Ship_Goods on 05-Mar untimely/premature). Deduct 2.0 points.
- **Justifications**: All ≤20 words. R2 fully incorrect. Minor variances elsewhere (e.g., R1 specifics amount/order unnecessarily; R5 omits Pay_Invoice; R4/R6 slightly wordier). Deduct 0.5 total.
- **Format**: Closely follows prompt (per-rule bold labels, status + justification, all-caps overall). No table but not required. Minor style diffs vs. ground truth table.
- **Overall**: Matches NON-COMPLIANT.
- **Strict adjustment**: Single critical factual error on R2 (linkage of R5 change to R2 timing) warrants significant penalty despite rest strong.
