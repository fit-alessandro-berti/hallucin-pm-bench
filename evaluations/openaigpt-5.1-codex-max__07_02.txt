9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), the single removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change (exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision), with no extras or omissions, matching the ground truth content precisely. It uses the exact headings from the prompt, ignores irrelevant changes (e.g., renamings like "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name), and structures logically.

Deductions (-1.0 total) for strictness on small differences vs. ground truth:
- Task presentation: ID-first "(name)" vs. name-first **name** (`id`) (-0.3)
- List style: Bullets vs. numbered (1., 2., 3.) (-0.2)
- Gateway wording: XML tags ("exclusiveGateway") vs. descriptive ("exclusive (XOR)" / "inclusive (OR)") + v1/v2 refs; no extras like (XOR)/(OR) (-0.3)
- Missing final note "(No other...)" and "## Expected Answer Key" header (-0.2)

Core accuracy is excellent (no factual errors), justifying high score despite stylistic variances.
