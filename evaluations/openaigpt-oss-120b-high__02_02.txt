The LLM answer is factually precise across all questions, with no missing, extra, or fabricated elements in the core content (e.g., the case count, sequence, and predecessors are exact matches to the ground truth). Minor deductions for extraneous phrasing (e.g., introductory sentences, bolding, backticks, and listing the case IDs in A1, which are unrequested) and slight formatting variances (e.g., plain lines vs. bullet points in A3), treated as small stylistic deviations under strict evaluation.
