The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" without forbidden terms, and it avoids introducing extra tasks or roles. However, it has multiple significant errors in RACI assignments that deviate from the ground truth and fail to reflect the process narrative: no "A" (Accountable) entries are used anywhere in the matrix despite the legend mentioning it, resulting in missing Accountable roles for the Account Manager in Receive Application, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, and Notify Customer (where GT combines R/A); incorrect assignments in KYC Review (AM as I instead of A; FC as I instead of C); Payment Clearance (AM as I instead of A; CO as I instead of C; IT as C instead of I); and Record Update (FC as I instead of C). Headers include unnecessary abbreviations not present in GT, and extraneous elements like the title, legend, and note add unwarranted content. These errors across nearly all rows warrant a low score under strict evaluation criteria emphasizing precise RACI allocations.
