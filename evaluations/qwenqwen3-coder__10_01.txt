7.0

**Rationale:**

- **Vocabulary compliance (critical):** The LLM answer uses all three required synonyms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") and does not mention the forbidden terms. Full marks here.
- **Format:** The matrix is properly formatted with activities as rows and roles as columns, as requested.
- **Role titles:** Correct acronyms and full names used.

**Errors and Loss of Points:**

- **Separation of R/A:** The LLM matrix fails to distinguish between Responsible (R) and Accountable (A). The ground truth explicitly specifies when someone is both (e.g., "R/A" for the Account Manager on several activities), clarifying that the same person is both responsible and accountable, and also lists "A" for certain roles. The LLM matrix omits all “A” assignments. This is a significant process-mapping error since precise RACI allocations are critical.
- **Allocation of Consulted/Informed:** There are deviations:
    - For **KYC Review**, the LLM answer: CO=R, AM=I, FC=I, IT=I. Ground truth: CO=R, AM=A, FC=C, IT=I. The LLM fails to mark the Finance Clerk as Consulted and omits Accountable designation for AM.
    - **Order Vetting:** LLM: AM=R, CO=C, FC=I, IT=I. Ground truth: AM=R/A, CO=C, FC=I, IT=I. LLM omits Accountable (AM) role.
    - Similar pattern elsewhere; "A" is always omitted, which is a key RACI error.
    - **Record Update:** LLM (FC=I), Ground truth (FC=C); similar error for other roles.
- **Unwarranted additions:** The answer adds a "Legend" and commentary that were not requested. While not strictly penalized, it is surplus to requirements.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer uses the right vocabulary and lays out the matrix with generally correct Responsible and Consulted/Informed allocations, but fumbles on the inclusion of the Accountable role throughout—a substantial omission in a strict RACI exercise. This merits a heavy penalty, but not a failing grade because the main process steps and mandated terms are present and there are no catastrophic formatting mistakes. Thus, 7.0.
