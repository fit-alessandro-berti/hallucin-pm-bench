2.0

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include: (1) Addition of an unauthorized extra activity ("Notification"), which violates "do not add activities" and introduces a row not present in the ground truth; (2) Renaming of activities (e.g., "Approval (70+ risk)" instead of "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Payment Release" instead of "Release Funds"), breaching "do not rename" instructions; (3) Merging or incomplete coverage, as the narrative's low-risk path (scheduling) is not distinctly handled without adding/merging; (4) Widespread inaccuracies in RACI assignments (e.g., for KYC Review: Front-Office as "I" vs. ground truth "-"; Compliance Analyst as "R" vs. "R, A"; Compliance Officer as "A" vs. "C"; similar errors in AML Screening, Risk Scoring, Approval, and Release Funds); (5) Failure to combine roles (e.g., no "R, A" notations, treating them separately or omitting); (6) Incorrect involvement indicators (e.g., assigning "I" or other roles to uninvolved parties like Compliance Officer as "-" in Intake Vetting; no use of dashes for no involvement); (7) Formatting errors (no bolding of activities or assignments; all cells filled, no "-"). While the four mandated vocabulary terms are used correctly without leaks, these structural, content, and fidelity errors result in only ~30% alignment with the ground truth, justifying a minimal score.
