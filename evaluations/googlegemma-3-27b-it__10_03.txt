3.0

The answer has several significant issues compared to the ground truth:

1. **Vocabulary Adherence:**  
   - The LLM answer uses only the authorized terms and does not leak synonyms—this is correct.

2. **Activity Naming and Granularity:**  
   - The activities "Approval (70+ risk)", "Payment Release", and "Notification" are unfaithful renderings relative to ground truth.
   - The activity "Compliance Officer Approval" (required) is named incorrectly as "Approval (70+ risk)".
   - The ground truth merges "Payment Release" and notification as "Release Funds", while the LLM answer splits these unnecessarily, and "Notification" is not specified as an activity in the original process narrative or ground truth.

3. **RACI Attribution Errors:**  
   - For "Intake Vetting", the ground truth is "R, A" (Front-Office Analyst), but LLM answer gives only "R" to this role and "I" elsewhere, misassigning responsibility/accountability.
   - For "KYC Review", ground truth is "R, A" (Compliance Analyst), but LLM assigns "R" to Compliance Analyst and "A" to Compliance Officer, which is incorrect.
   - "AML Screening" and "Risk Scoring" have similar mistakes—Accountability is misplaced.
   - The ground truth uses "C" in several cells, which is missing in the LLM answer.
   - Compliance Officer Approval is omitted as an activity and instead crammed into a defective “Approval (70+ risk)” row.
   - "Payment Release" and "Notification" are not named per the process narrative or ground truth, and have incorrect RACI assignments.
   - Dashes are missing where there’s “no involvement”, and "C" marks are poorly or not at all represented.

4. **Formatting issues:**  
   - The LLM answer uses inline code fences (unnecessary) and deviates from the representation in the ground truth.

Given the above violations—both conceptual (activity granularity, RACI mappings) and detailed (role-activity intersections)—with great strictness, this answer gets a 3.0. The only reason it is not lower is that vocabulary adherence is correct and some RACI assignments are partially plausible. However, numerous key mistakes in activity breakdown, mapping, and omissions require a severe penalty.
