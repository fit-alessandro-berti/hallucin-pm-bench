The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, but it contains minor formatting and phrasing deviations that, per instructions, should result in significant penalty:

- It does not use the element names exactly as in the XML for headings—the ground truth puts the id in backticks and lists the name in parentheses; the LLM answer combines both inline.
- In "Gateway type changes," the ground truth states: "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)". The LLM instead writes: "exclusiveGateway id="gw_valid" name="Warranty Valid?" to inclusiveGateway id="gw_valid" name="Warranty Valid?"—which, while factually accurate, does not follow the ground truth's template and mixes type and attributes in a single statement.

No factual errors are present, but these stylistic/formatting mismatches and very slight lack of precision warrant the deduction.
