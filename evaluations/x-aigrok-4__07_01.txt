The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), with no additions, omissions, or speculation. However, it loses points for presentation differences from the ground truth: use of XML-like tag formats instead of name-first with (id = `id`) structure; plain line breaks instead of * bullets; inclusion of redundant full name repetition in gateway change without (v1)/(v2) versioning or bold emphasis; and exact heading bullets (â€¢) that mismatch the ground truth's bold **headings** without bullets. These formatting variances, while minor, are treated strictly as they alter readability and structure alignment.
