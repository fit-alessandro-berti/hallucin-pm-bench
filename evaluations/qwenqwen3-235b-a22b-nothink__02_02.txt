The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, order, and factual precision for all three questions. Q1 is identical (3 distinct cases). Q2 sequences the activities for C002 correctly with the specified separator (â†’), including all events in chronological order. Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) one per line in alphabetical order, with no extras, omissions, or errors. Minor formatting differences (e.g., absence of bullet dashes in Q3 compared to ground truth presentation) do not affect the substantive accuracy, as the original prompt requires only "one per line, alphabetically ordered" without specifying bullets. The optional explanation is accurate and aligns with the log, introducing no hallucinations.
