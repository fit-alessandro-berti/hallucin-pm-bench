10.0

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate/not accurate), coverage of all three cases, identification of reversed ordering in cases 1001 and 1003, absence of Update_Inventory in case 1002 as a counterexample to "always," and conclusion that the claimed sequence (Authorize_Refund immediately before Update_Inventory) does not hold. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate"; inclusion of timestamps vs. line numbers) are stylistic and do not introduce errors or deviations from the data, maintaining strict adherence to the prompt's requirements for a short, evidence-based justification citing case IDs and activities. No guessing or unsubstantiated statements appear.
