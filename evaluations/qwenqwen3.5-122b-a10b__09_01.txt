9.2

**Evaluation Reasoning (strict assessment):**
- **Core correctness (strength):** Both correctly conclude the value cannot be derived/computed due to missing temporal data (timestamps/durations). LLM precisely echoes the system instruction phrasing ("cannot be derived"), matches the need for per-activity durations, and addresses both prompt questions (1: direct answer; 2: explanation). Perfect alignment on impossibility of calculation. (+9.5 base)
- **Differences impacting score (deductions):**
  - Phrasing variance: "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed" (-0.1); "requested value" vs. direct rephrasing of question (-0.1).
  - Structure: Numbered explanation with bolding vs. concise single paragraph (-0.1).
  - Extraneous content: Second point on benchmarks is accurate but unnecessary (benchmarks lack "Review Contract" data anyway, and ground truth omits entirely, focusing solely on log deficiencies) (-0.1).
- No factual errors, fabrications, or policy violations. Minor stylistic/content expansions prevent perfect 10.0 under utmost strictness.
