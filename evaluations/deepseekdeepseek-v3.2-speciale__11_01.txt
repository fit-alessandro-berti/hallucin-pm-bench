The LLM answer fully matches on core requirements: correct top 3 activities ranked by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120.0 h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44.0 h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4 h), verbatim quotes for both metrics, no extraneous content (e.g., no service times or other activities), crisp memo format ≤150 words (~110 words).

Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting issues (e.g., portals/reminders for slow docs, automation for dispatch delays, triage for queues), and explicitly promise ≥20% cuts. However, deduct 0.8 for stylistic/structure differences vs. ground truth (full memo headers/closing vs. raw bullets; generic actions without ground truth's fabricated "data" claims like "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%"), reducing "data-driven" feel slightly despite no invention of unsupported table data. Strict but near-perfect fulfillment.
