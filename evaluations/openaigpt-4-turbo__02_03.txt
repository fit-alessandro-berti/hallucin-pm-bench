9.0  
- Content is fully correct and matches ground truth exactly on facts (3 cases listed correctly; Pack_Items precedes Ship_Order for C456; Cancel_Order appears once).  
- Minor deductions for verbosity (extra explanatory phrases like "There are", "The activity...is", "appears exactly once" violate "concise...only"; ground truth is minimal).  
- Formatting close (bullets used) but not identical (nested bullets, longer bold labels vs. **A1:** style; no strict format specified beyond bullets, but differs from ground truth).  
Strict evaluation penalizes phrasing/format mismatches despite semantic perfection.
