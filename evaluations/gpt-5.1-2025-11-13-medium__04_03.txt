The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying the non-compliance ("No"), the exact violation (Rule 3 due to NA before RA), and satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4 with precise reasoning aligned to the rules and trace. It explicitly notes "exactly once" for Rule 1 activities, which adds clarity over the ground truth's slightly less explicit phrasing. Minor deductions for format differences (bullets vs. table with symbols) and slightly less structured overall summary, per strict evaluation criteria emphasizing even small variances.
