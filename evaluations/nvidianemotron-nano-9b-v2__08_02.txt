**Score: 7.5**

The LLM answer is quite strong and essentially correct, demonstrating a clear understanding of the Petri net’s behavior and providing a minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth logic. However, strict evaluation criteria reveal the following minor but meaningful issues:

- **Sequence Format**: The LLM presents the sequence as “T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5” without explicitly numbering steps or mentioning intermediary markings, which the ground truth answer provides. This makes the mapping to the state changes slightly less explicit.
- **Marking Progression**: No explicit mention of markings (e.g., M₁, M₂, etc.), which, while not strictly required, provide clarity and are present in the ground truth.
- **Disabling T3**: The ground truth answer notes that after firing T5, T3 is disabled—an important structural property. The LLM answer omits this closure, reducing completeness.
- **Conciseness**: The LLM answer uses a few redundant phrases (e.g., “At this point, P2 (from T1) and P5 (from T4) are both present,” which could be clearer as “P2 and P5 are marked...”).
- **Admissibility/Minimality**: The LLM refers to “minimal” but doesn’t explicitly state that T3 never fires, while the ground truth clarifies minimality by demonstrating T3 is still disabled at the end.

These issues are minor, but per request for utmost strictness, they justify a deduction. Overall, the answer is accurate and its differences are presentational and completion-related rather than factual—hence a score of 7.5.
