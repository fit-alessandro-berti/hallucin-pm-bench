The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Question 1 and provides an accurate, minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) that matches the ground truth's sequence and demonstrates T5 firing before T3. The explanation concisely captures the key mechanism (generating P5 via the alternative path while preserving the P2 token), without errors or omissions impacting validity. It adheres to the ≤120-word limit and aligns closely with the ground truth's intent, including markings implicitly through transition effects. No deductions needed, as differences (e.g., lack of explicit markings or post-T5 disablement note) are stylistic and non-substantive.
