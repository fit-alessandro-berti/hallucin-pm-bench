**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: Exact count "1", no deviations. +2.5/2.5
- **Q2 (near-perfect)**: Correct calculation (1/18 × 100 = 5.56%), rounded properly. Minor deductions for "≈" (implying approximation vs. exact), no space before "%" (GT: "5.56 %"), and extra explanatory steps beyond GT's concise math. +2.4/2.5
- **Q3 (perfect match)**: Correctly identifies "A1002" only, with equivalent wording ("has the activity" ≈ "contains"); formatting (bold) aligns. +2.5/2.5
- **Q4 (strong but not identical)**: Provides exactly two clear, valid reasons directly mappable to GT:
  - "Selection bias" (single day) = "Temporal bias" (short time window, non-representative day).
  - "Small sample size" (18 events, high variability) = exact GT example.
  No hallucinations. Minor deductions for labeling ("Selection bias" vs. GT's "Temporal bias"), less quantitative detail (e.g., no "±5.56 pp." or "four cases"), and slightly more verbose phrasing. +2.3/2.5
- **Overall**: No rule violations, inferences, or absences; adheres to log-only data. Minor formatting/wording/verbosity issues (-0.3 total) warrant strict deduction per instructions, but content fidelity is exceptional.
