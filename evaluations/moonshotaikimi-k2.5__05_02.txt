The LLM answer correctly identifies and targets the same problematic `camunda:dueDate="P5D"` attribute on `Task_CollectEquipment` with a single-hunk unified diff modifying only an existing element's attribute (valid per rules), provides a proper standard unified diff format with context/file headers (arguably superior to ground truth's malformed empty `@@` hunk), and delivers a concise one-sentence rationale focused on bottleneck reduction for SLA compliance. However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for: (1) wrong new value `"P1D"` vs ground truth `"P2D"` (core functional difference in the proposed improvement); (2) extra context lines, line numbers, and file headers not matching ground truth's minimalism; (3) divergent rationale wording/details (e.g., "five days to one day" and "policy-mandated completion target" vs "5 days to 2 days" and "contractual 3-day SLA"). These are not trivial—especially the mismatched dueDate value, which alters the exact fix.
