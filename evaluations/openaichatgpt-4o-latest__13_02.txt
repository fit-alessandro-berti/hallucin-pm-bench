**Score: 9.2**

- **Q1**: Correct ("Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs once).
- **Q2a**: Correct (2.08%).
- **Q2b**: Correct (8.33%).
- **Q3**: Good explanation: references overfitting, skewing averages, and warns against generalization from one case. It explicitly mentions that "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears in only 1 of 12 cases, and describes skewed analyses.

**Deductions:**  
- Wording in (3) doesn't explicitly mention "variance/instability" or "confidence intervals," but alludes to overfitting, skew in averages, and the danger to predictive modelsâ€”which is sufficient, though not perfectly matching all the ground truth's cautions.  
- The explanation is accurate and prudent, but could further stress instability or unreliability in statistics due to the single observation.

**Summary:**  
All numeric answers are flawless, and the short-answer meets most (but possibly not all) requirements in the ground truth. The explanation is valid, but to strictly match the rubric, it very slightly downplays statistical instability/variance. Thus, **9.2**.
