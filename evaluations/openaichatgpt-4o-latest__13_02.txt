The LLM answer is nearly perfect, matching the ground truth exactly on questions 1, 2a, and 2b (deterministic numerics). For question 3, it adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (68 words), explicitly notes the single occurrence (1/12 cases), addresses instability/variance (e.g., skewing averages, overfitting), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., wrong assumptions, need for filtering/abstraction). Minor deduction for slightly narrower focus on models/optimization vs. broader statistical unreliability (e.g., no direct mention of confidence intervals or noise), but key criteria are met without invention or deviation from the log.
