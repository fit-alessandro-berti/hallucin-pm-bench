9.5

- The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth, listing the correct items for all three questions.
- For A1, rather than simply stating "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" as the ground truth does, the LLM lists them in bullet points, but the value is correct and explicit.
- For A2, the given answer "Pack_Items" is correct.
- For A3, the answer "Cancel_Order" is correct.
- The only (very minor) deviation is in the formatting: question 1 expands to bullets rather than a summary like "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)". According to the strict rubric, this slightly differs in conciseness, and such a small format difference results in a fractional point deduction.
- The content and order of the answers are perfect.

**Conclusion:** 9.5/10 â€“ Perfect factual correctness, ultra-small markdown for formatting not matching the "concise, bullet-point" instruction as tightly as ground truth.
