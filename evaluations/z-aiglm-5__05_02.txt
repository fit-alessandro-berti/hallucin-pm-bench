### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Core Improvement (change itself)**: Identical modification to `camunda:dueDate="P5D"` → `"P2D"` on the correct task (+10/10, no loss).
- **Diff Format**: Proper unified diff single hunk with context, but includes extraneous file headers (`--- a/process.bpmn +++ b/process.bpmn`) not present in XML or ground truth, extra/multi-line context beyond minimal change, and @@ line numbers/context count (`-9,7 +9,7`) assuming specific line positioning (-1.3 points).
- **Diff Content**: Exact match on changed lines, no additions/deletions (-0).
- **Rationale**: One sentence as required, semantically similar (addresses bottleneck/SLA via dueDate reduction), but literal differences in wording ("dominant bottleneck...critical path...risk of total process duration SLA breaches" vs. "**Collect Equipment** due-date...3-day SLA...no new activities"), retains ISO `P5D/P2D` vs. expanded "5 days/2 days", no bolding, omits explicit rule reaffirmation and unsubstantiated "3-day SLA" (-0.5 points).
- **Overall Structure**: Follows 1. diff + 2. rationale implicitly, no extras like ground truth headers/sections (+0).
- **Strictness Applied**: Minor format/verbosity and wording variances treated as significant (total -1.8 deduction from 10.0).
