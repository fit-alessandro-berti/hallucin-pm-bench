6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Factual accuracy**: Perfect (10/10). Correctly identifies added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway change (`gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). No extras or speculation.
- **Headings**: Mostly matches prompt's "exact headings" (uses • Added tasks etc. with bold), but differs from ground truth (no •, minor spacing). Minor deduction (-0.5).
- **Task listings**: Significant error. Uses only `id` attributes (lowercase, e.g., "check_vip") instead of `name` attributes + id as in ground truth (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Prompt's "element names exactly as they appear" is ambiguous but ground truth prioritizes `name` for tasks; ids alone mismatch (-2.0).
- **Gateway phrasing**: Concise but mismatches ground truth's verbose format, bolding, → arrow vs "changed from ... to", and (v1)/(v2) labels (-1.0).
- **Overall format/structure**: Close but not identical (bullets, bolding similar; no extra note). Strictness demands near-exact match to ground truth (-0.5).

Total: Starts at 10, deducts for textual/format mismatches to 6.0.
