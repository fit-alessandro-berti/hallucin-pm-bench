**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "**No**" and provides a valid counterexample (C003, lines 6-7) that disproves the "always" claim, with accurate timestamps, case-IDs, and a clear explanation in one paragraph as required. However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for key differences from the ground truth: (1) omission of the second clear counterexample in C005 (line 11: Validate_Payment with no Receive_Order at all in that case), making the justification incomplete; (2) the phrase "while other instances (e.g., C001...C004...) follow" implicitly misrepresents by not addressing C005 as another violating instance of Validate_Payment, creating a partial factual inaccuracy in scope; (3) lacks the ground truth's explicit plural "counter-examples" and coverage of both cases for fuller disproof. These omissions and mismatches, even if one counterexample suffices logically, represent substantial deviations warranting a mid-range score rather than excellence.
