7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 5.0/10)**  
The LLM correctly identifies the two true decision points (the risk-based conditional branch and the TriVote gate) and describes their rules accurately, closely aligning with the process description (e.g., the skip condition matches exactly, and the TriVote rule of "any two out of three" is precisely stated). However, under strict criteria, significant deductions are warranted for:  
- Incorrectly adding a third "decision point" for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself, which is an assessment step producing an input (risk rating), not a gate or conditional branch. The ground truth explicitly frames only the post-check conditional as the first decision point ("Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"), making this an extraneous and erroneous inclusion.  
- Minor wording deviation in TriVote: The LLM uses "the loan passes if any two... approve," while the ground truth specifies "the loan may advance only when at least two... record 'Approve'"—this alters the phrasing slightly (e.g., no quotation of "Approve") and omits the conditional nuance of advancement, counting as a small but notable error.  
These issues introduce clear differences in structure (3 vs. 2 points) and precision, justifying a halved score despite the core rules being intact.

**Part (b) - Documents (Score: 10.0/10)**  
The list is identical to the ground truth in content, order, and completeness—no additions, omissions, or hallucinations (e.g., no improper inclusion of KYC/AML items). All documents (including the signed variant of Offer Sheet 77 as distinct) appear exactly as they first do in the process.

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average (assuming equal parts), with strict penalty for part (a) errors: (5.0 + 10.0) / 2 = 7.5, rounded down to 7.0 for the structural miscategorization's impact on fidelity to the prompt's focus on "gates or conditional branches."
