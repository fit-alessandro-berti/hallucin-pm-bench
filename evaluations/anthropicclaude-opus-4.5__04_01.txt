The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying "Non-compliant" status and the exact same rule violations (2 and 3) and compliances (1, 4, 5) as the ground truth, with precise event citations and rule interpretations. Justifications are numbered, cite relevant rules, and explain violations/compliances similarly. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major deduction for numerical error in Rule 3**: LLM states "distance = 4 activities after Goods_Received"; ground truth states "distance = 3". This is a clear factual mismatch in quantifying the distance, despite both correctly concluding violation. (-1.0)
- **Minor deductions for extras deviating from ground truth style**: Unnecessary timestamps in Rule 2, checkmark symbols (✓ ✗), bolding, and added "Summary" section introduce differences not in ground truth, slightly altering presentation. (-0.0 as negligible alone, but contributes to strictness)

No other errors in logic, citations, or conclusions. Extremely close match, but small numerical/quantitative error warrants significant penalty per instructions.
