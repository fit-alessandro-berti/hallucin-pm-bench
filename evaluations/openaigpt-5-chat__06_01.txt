9.0

The LLM answer lists the correct task pairs from Process B that can be executed in parallel and in the correct alphabetical order within each pair. However, it omits the **spacing/alignment** used in the ground truth: the ground truth aligns the em dashes and spaces for formatting (e.g., "Procure_Materials     â€”  Schedule_Machines"), which is not strictly semantic but was specified.

Given the instruction to be "utmost strict" and that "small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," the lack of adherence to the explicit output format (with multiple spaces for alignment) is an error. Content-wise, the answer is perfect, but the output formatting is imperfect.

Thus, the answer loses one full point due to not matching the output format *exactly*, for a final score of **9.0**.
