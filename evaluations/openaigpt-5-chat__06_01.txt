The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and core format (one pair per line with "Task_X  â€”  Task_Y"). Minor whitespace variations (e.g., lack of alignment in the second pair) do not constitute substantive errors under the specified criteria, as the instruction does not mandate alignment.
