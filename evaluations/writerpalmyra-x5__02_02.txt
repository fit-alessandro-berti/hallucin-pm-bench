**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually precise and fully matches the ground truth across all questions:

- **Q1/A1**: Correct count (3); listing cases is accurate and non-hallucinated detail.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence, order, and separators; names match log (escapes in ground truth are formatting artifacts).
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), one per line, alphabetically ordered; introductory phrasing is accurate and aligns with prompt requirements.

No extras, omissions, fabrications, or errors; formatting differences (e.g., bullets vs. plain lines, verbosity) are negligible as content is identical and prompt-compliant.
