The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with accurate task lists, matching the ground truth content. However, it includes an unrequested introductory sentence, bolded process title, and concluding sentence, deviating from the prompt's instruction to return the answer strictly as numbered lines without additional text. This format violation, though minor in impact, warrants a deduction under strict evaluation criteria. Spacing after commas is inconsistent but negligible.
