The LLM answer fully matches the prompt requirements and scoring notes with perfect correctness (exact activities ranked by avg waiting time, verbatim quotes of both metrics from table), zero unwarranted content, and highly relevant, concrete actions logically tied to waiting times with explicit ≥20% pledges (plausibly data-driven via process-mining context). Stylistic differences from ground truth (e.g., full memo headers, fuller "95th percentile" phrasing, reworded but equivalent actions) enhance "crisp executive memo" format without violations; under 150 words. No errors.
