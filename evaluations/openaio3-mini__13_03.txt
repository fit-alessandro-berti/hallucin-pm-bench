7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Perfect match—both identify exactly one occurrence. No deduction.
- **Question 2**: The LLM answer is concise (78 words), relevant, and correctly identifies sampling limitations and bias leading to underestimation. However, under strict criteria, it earns partial credit due to omissions: lacks quantification of sample size (e.g., 14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), statistical details on rarity amplification (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, sampling error), and critical pitfalls like near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check,” “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) causing string-matching distortions. These differences reduce completeness and precision, warranting a ~25% deduction from a full score.
