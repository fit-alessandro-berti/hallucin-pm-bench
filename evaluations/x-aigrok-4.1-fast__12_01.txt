**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in verdict ("not accurate" ≡ "inaccurate"), coverage of all three cases, key evidence (reversed order in 1001/1003, absence in 1002 disproving "always"), and conclusion (sequence never occurs ≡ does not precede in none). Citations use precise timestamps (equivalent to line refs for verification). Extra accurate detail in case 1002 (successor activity) reinforces without error or deviation. Fully matches "short justification citing case IDs and activities." No factual, logical, or structural discrepancies.
