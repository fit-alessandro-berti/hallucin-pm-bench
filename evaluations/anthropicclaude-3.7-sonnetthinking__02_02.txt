9.5

Q1: Correct. The LLM answer identifies all three distinct cases: C001, C002, C003.  
Q2: Correct. The sequence for C002 is exactly as in the ground truth, including proper separator and order.  
Q3: Minor issue. The activity "Check_Stock" is missing the underscore ("Check_Stock") in both output items. "Arrange_Delivery" is written as in the log, but "Check_Stock" is outputted as "Check_Stock" (which is actually correct). However, on careful inspection, both are spelled correctly and listed alphabetically, matching the ground truth both in wording and order.

Upon reevaluation, the answer is, in fact, completely correct in terms of content and formatting.  
However, there are minor stylistic inconsistencies: for example, Q3's output is in plain text, not formatted as a bullet list with underscores escaped, but that was not firmly specified in the instructions.

Therefore:
- There are no factual errors.
- There are very minor stylistic/formatting issues (e.g., no <br> or bullet-points).

Given the instruction to be "utmost strict," I'll deduct 0.5 points for slight formatting deviations (listing activities with simple line breaks instead of formatting), even if this is somewhat subjective.

Final score: **9.5**
