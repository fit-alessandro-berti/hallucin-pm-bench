The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, structure, and factual precision across all questions: Q1 is identical (3 distinct cases); Q2 sequences the activities for C002 correctly and verbatim (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order, ignoring markdown escapes in ground truth); Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) one per line and alphabetically ordered, with no additions, omissions, or errors. No deductions apply under strict evaluation.
