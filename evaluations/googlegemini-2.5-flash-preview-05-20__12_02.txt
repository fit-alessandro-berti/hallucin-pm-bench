The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground-truth: it answers "No", lists the correct supporting evidence, and refers to line numbers and case IDs as required. It mentions that for C003 (lines 6-7), *Validate_Payment* precedes *Receive_Order*, and in C005 (line 11), *Validate_Payment* occurs without any *Receive_Order*. The only very minor distinction: the gold-standard answer is a bit more explicit that these cases individually "prove" the claim false, but the LLM's justification closely matches the gold standard's, even using similar wording. Any differences are extremely slight and not substantive. Deducting a minimal fraction of a point for not using the exact "prove" phrasing and for slight wording differences, but this is otherwise an exemplary answer.
