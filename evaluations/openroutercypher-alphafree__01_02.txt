The LLM answer correctly identifies the three key decision points with their associated process activity names. Some phrasing is slightly less precise or omits minor clarifications (e.g., does not specify the precise *location* in workflow where decisions happen, such as "after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). The logic of each point matches the ground truth, but small omissions in context and step placement reflect a minor but notable drop in accuracy.

The required document list closely matches the ground truth (all six items are listed, using correct names). Very minor inaccuracy: the LLM says "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" rather than just "Community Impact Statement (CIS)"â€”"template" might be a bit imprecise, but it doesn't introduce a substantive error.

Overall, this is highly accurate and precise, though small deficiencies in step-context and slightly imprecise terminology should result in a noticeable but not severe point deduction.
