### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall in structure and coverage, accurately identifying the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing all six required documents without introducing forbidden standard loan terminology. It adheres closely to the provided activity names and process flow. However, under strict evaluation criteria, several small but notable differences from the ground truth warrant deductions:

- **Decision Points (minor to moderate inaccuracies)**:
  - Point 1: Omits specific naming of "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" and the exact phrase "tie-break decision" (ground truth uses "escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break"). It also phrases the condition as "proceed if ≤2; else escalate" without the ground truth's precise arrow notation (⇒ continue/escalate) or emphasis on the branch logic.
  - Point 2: Fails to specify the positioning "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" as in ground truth, which is a key contextual detail in the process flow. It uses "MBA" abbreviation prematurely (ground truth introduces it only in Point 3).
  - Point 3: Minor formatting/emphasis issues (e.g., lowercase "approve/reject" vs. ground truth's bold **Approve** or **Reject**); lacks the "(MBA)" abbreviation for consistency.
  - No headers like "#### Decision points" (ground truth uses them for clarity).

- **Required Documents (minor inaccuracies)**:
  - Proof of Address: Adds "old" ("≤ 3 months old") vs. ground truth's concise "(≤ 3 months)".
  - Latest Income Statement: Includes extraneous "single" ("single pay-stub or tax slip") and "or" vs. ground truth's slashed "(pay-stub/tax slip)".
  - Community Impact Statement: Adds "template" ("(CIS) template") vs. ground truth's simple "(CIS)".
  - Omits the ground truth's explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which reinforces the non-standard process as per the system prompt's emphasis on differences from textbook procedures.
  - No header like "#### Required documents (complete list)" and lacks the "(complete list)" qualifier.

These omissions and additions introduce subtle deviations from exact terminology/flow and completeness, reducing fidelity. No major errors (e.g., wrong points or missing documents), so the score isn't below 8.0, but strictness demands ~1.8-point deduction for cumulative small errors.
