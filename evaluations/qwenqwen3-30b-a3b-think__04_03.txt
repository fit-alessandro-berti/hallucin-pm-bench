The LLM answer correctly identifies overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses Rules 1, 2, and 3 with justifications that align closely with the ground truth, including the key violation in Rule 3 (NA before RA). Rule 4 is correctly noted as positionally satisfied but marred by a minor inaccuracy ("Partially satisfied" instead of fully satisfied, as the rule's condition holds independently). Phrasing differences (e.g., not explicitly reiterating "both QE and RA" in Rule 3 or mentioning severity in Rule 2) and format (bullets vs. table) are small but deduct points under strict evaluation, though core logic and references to rules match well without substantive errors.
