10.0

The LLM answer is fully compliant and accurate, with no factual errors, violations, or omissions relative to the ground truth. It correctly identifies the overall non-compliance due to Rule 3, provides a short justification referencing all rules (satisfied or violated), and matches the required "Yes" or "No" format. Minor differences in phrasing (e.g., "before" vs. "precedes"; bullet points vs. table) and explicitness (e.g., no final summary sentence) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as the substance is identical and adheres precisely to the prompt's instructions.
