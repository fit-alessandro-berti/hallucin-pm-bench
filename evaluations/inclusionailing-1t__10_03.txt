### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt by using the four mandated terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without leaking disallowed synonyms, which aligns with the vocabulary policy and key judge points. It attempts a Markdown table format for a RACI matrix and covers roles/activity involvement to some degree. However, under strict evaluation, significant deductions are warranted for the following errors and deviations from the ground truth:

- **Structural and Formatting Issues (-2.0 points)**: The table is malformed (e.g., missing pipes | in rows like AML Screening, creating unparseable Markdown; inconsistent cell padding; empty or dashed cells like "—" used informally instead of structured "–" or explicit R/A/C/I). The orientation (activities in first column, then R/A/C/I columns) is a valid alternative to the ground truth's (roles as columns), but the execution is sloppy and harder to read, violating clean Markdown output expectations.

- **Added/Renamed/Merged Activities (-1.5 points)**: The prompt forbids renaming, merging, or adding activities, yet the LLM introduces "Approval Decision" and "Payment Scheduling & Release", which approximate the ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" but deviate by merging scheduling/release and using unauthorized phrasing. This adds unauthorized content and doesn't match the ground truth's exact activity names.

- **Incomplete Coverage of Activities and Roles (-1.0 points)**: While it covers the four core activities, the additions are imprecise, and it fails to fully map "every activity" (e.g., no clean separation of approval vs. release as in ground truth). Roles are partially covered but not exhaustively for all cells (e.g., empty Consulted columns; conditional notations like "(if escalated)" or "(depending on risk score)" introduce extraneous logic not in the ground truth).

- **Inaccurate RACI Assignments (-1.0 points)**: Multiple mismatches vs. ground truth, even for core activities:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Correctly identifies Front-Office Analyst as R/A, but marks Compliance Analyst as I (should be C) and omits Treasury Ops as I; Officer involvement missing (– in ground truth).
  - **KYC Review**: Compliance Analyst as R (correct), but Officer as A (should be C); Informed includes extras like Officer "(if escalated)" (not in ground truth, which has simple I for Treasury).
  - **AML Screening**: Compliance Analyst as R/A (but ground truth has R/A for Analyst with Officer as C); Informed omits Officer C.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Compliance Analyst as R (correct), Officer as A (correct), but Informed for Front-Office (should be C) and misses explicit I for Treasury in context.
  - Added activities have invented assignments (e.g., conditional R/A for Approval) that don't align with ground truth's clean R,A for Officer in approval and R,A for Treasury in release.

These errors compound to show superficial understanding of the process narrative, with small inaccuracies (e.g., wrong RACI labels like A vs. C) causing outsized point loss per the strictness directive. The answer is functional at a basic level but far from precise or faithful to the ground truth.
