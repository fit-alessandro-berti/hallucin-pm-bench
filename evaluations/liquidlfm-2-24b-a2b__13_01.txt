**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict per-question breakdown, utmost strictness applied):
- **Q1 (2.0/2.5)**: Final answer "1" matches `1` occurrence perfectly. However, explanation hallucinates wrong timestamp ("10:25:00" instead of log's "10:50:00" for Manual_Fraud_Check), violating "only ground-truth data" rule and introducing deviation/hallucination. Significant deduction (-0.5).
- **Q2 (2.5/2.5)**: "5.56%" matches calculation exactly. Minor formatting diff (no space before % vs. ground truth `5.56 %`), but content identical → no deduction.
- **Q3 (2.4/2.5)**: "A1002" matches; phrasing "Only **A1002** contains..." nearly identical to "Only case **A1002** contains...". Minor omission of "case" → small deduction (-0.1).
- **Q4 (2.8/2.5)**: Provides two clear, matching reasons (small sample size; temporal bias via short time window/not evenly distributed). Exceeds by rephrasing/repeating but stays within allowed "any two... stated clearly" (aligns with small sample + temporal). Minor extra verbosity → no major deduction, slight over (+0.3 capped).
- **Overall (8.2/10.0)**: Final answers align ~95% (core content/calculations exact, Q4 valid). Deductions only for hallucinated timestamp (major violation per ground truth note on deviations), tiny phrasing/format diffs. Verbose structure/extra summaries tolerated as non-contradictory, but strictness amplifies small errors (e.g., 1 wrong log detail = outsized penalty). No other inferences/hallucinations.
