The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of calculation due to missing timestamps, aligning with the ground truth's core reasoning in a single concise sentence. However, it loses points for slight phrasing differences ("cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"), omitting the explicit mention of "only event counts," and not including the precise explanation of absent "start-to-completion intervals," which reduces completeness under strict evaluation.
