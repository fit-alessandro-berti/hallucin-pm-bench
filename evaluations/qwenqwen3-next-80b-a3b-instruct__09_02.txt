The LLM answer is concise and correct in stating the key reason (lack of timestamps or duration data), which aligns with the ground truth. However, it omits the extra detail in the ground truth about only having event counts and lacking start-to-completion intervals. Because the instructions advise strictness and expect close alignment, this omission—albeit minor—warrants a significant, but not maximal, deduction.
