1.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This evaluation is conducted with utmost strictness, penalizing even minor deviations in structure, content, vocabulary application, task coverage, and RACI assignments relative to the ground truth (GT). The LLM answer deviates substantially, warranting a near-minimal score. Key differences include:

- **Columns/Roles (Major Deviation, -3.0 points)**: LLM uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support. GT includes an additional "Operations Manager" column, which alters the entire RACI framework. This omission makes direct comparisons impossible and violates full fidelity to GT's structure.

- **Rows/Tasks (Major Deviation, -2.5 points)**: LLM has 8 rows, including extras like "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" (separated from release) and "Notify the Regulatory Liaison that the case is archived" (not in GT). GT has exactly 6 concise rows covering the source without extras or omissions (e.g., no separate SWIFT row; notification is implicitly handled in archiving). LLM's verbose task phrasings (e.g., "Receive the customer’s transfer instruction and log it in the system") mismatch GT's shortened, mandated versions (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction"). The extra "Notify" row misapplies vocabulary by embedding "Regulatory Liaison" in a task description, against the mandate to use terms "for activities and roles."

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deviation, -2.0 points)**: Assignments differ across nearly every row due to the column mismatch and non-standard notations. Examples:
  - Receive: LLM (R/Analyst, A/Liaison, I/IT) vs. GT (R/Analyst, I/Liaison, A/Ops, C/IT) – Wrong accountability and consultation.
  - KYC Review: LLM (C/Analyst, R/A/Liaison, I/IT) vs. GT (C/Analyst, R/Liaison, A/Ops, I/IT) – Non-standard "R/A" (GT uses separate R/A); missing Ops A.
  - Approve: LLM (I/Analyst, R/A/Liaison, I/IT) vs. GT (C/Analyst, R/Liaison, A/Ops, I/IT) – Incorrect C/I for Analyst.
  - Similar mismatches in Release, Archive (LLM splits archiving from notification; GT combines without separate notify).
  - No GT row for SWIFT, so LLM's addition is extraneous.

- **Formatting and Extras (Minor but Penalized Deviation, -0.5 points)**: LLM's "Key" section is more verbose than GT's "Legend"; uses R/A notation not in GT. Task headers lack GT's "/ Activity (mandated wording)" and bolding (e.g., **KYC Review**). While LLM applies mandated vocabulary (e.g., "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") correctly in most places, the extras dilute strict adherence.

- **Overall Coverage and Fidelity (Compounding Penalty, -0.5 points)**: LLM claims to "cover every activity... without omissions," but introduces unsubstantiated splits/extensions not in source or GT. Does not "organise the RACI matrix clearly" per GT's concise style. No credit for partial vocabulary compliance, as structural errors dominate.

Base score starts at 10.0; cumulative deductions yield 1.5. The answer is functionally incompatible with GT despite superficial similarities in mandated terms.
