**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1**: Minor phrasing difference ("**1** time" vs. "`1` occurrence"). Matches count exactly but adds "time" (echoing question unnecessarily). -0.2 deduction.
- **Q2**: Exact match on value (5.56%) and calculation logic; includes explicit total events (bonus clarity). Formatting minor ("% " vs "%"). No deduction.
- **Q3**: Correct identifier but significantly shorter/missing explanatory phrasing ("**A1002**." vs. "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”."). Deviates from ideal verbosity. -0.2 deduction.
- **Q4**: Perfectly selects and clearly states **two** matching reasons ("Small sample size" direct match; "Non-representative time window" = "Temporal bias"). Specifics accurate (e.g., time range from logs), no hallucination. Minor generality vs. ground truth quantification (e.g., no ±5.56 pp.), but allowed as "any two clearly stated." No deduction.

Overall: Extremely close (no factual errors, no inferences beyond data), but small phrasing/verbosity diffs warrant strict 0.5 total loss from 10.0.
