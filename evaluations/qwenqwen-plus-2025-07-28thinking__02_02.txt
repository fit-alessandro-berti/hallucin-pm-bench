The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in factual content across all three questions: Q1 is exact (3 distinct cases); Q2 provides the identical sequence in the required order and separator; Q3 lists the exact two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock), alphabetically ordered and one per line, with no extras, omissions, or fabrications. Minor formatting differences (e.g., backticks in Q2, plain lines vs. bulleted in ground truth A3) do not constitute errors, as they preserve the required output structure and precision. Explanatory rationales are supplementary and accurate but not penalized, per the evaluation focus on factual precision.
