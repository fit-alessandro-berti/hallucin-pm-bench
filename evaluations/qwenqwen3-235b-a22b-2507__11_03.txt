4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Structure and Format (Major Deduction: -2.5 points)**: The ground truth uses a formal executive memo structure with "To:", "From:", "Subject:", and a clear introductory analysis referencing total cases (4,805 completed). The LLM answer lacks any header or formal memo elements, starting abruptly as a plain paragraph, which deviates significantly from the professional tone and organization expected in an executive memo. It also fails to mention total cases or tie to "largest queues," reducing completeness.
  
- **Identification and Quantification of Activities (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) and accurately quantifies SLA excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and waiting times. However, the order differs (LLM: Risk Review first, then Legal, then Credit; GT: Legal first, Risk, Credit), and presentation is in unformatted paragraph form instead of GT's bolded, structured list, making it less readable and executive-level.

- **Invented Content (Significant Deduction: -1.5 points)**: The LLM includes an ungrounded sentence ("These bottlenecks delay downstream processes and increase customer risk"), which invents impacts not supported by the table data, violating the prompt's "ground every sentence in the data" rule. The GT avoids such speculation, staying tightly data-focused.

- **Recommendations (Significant Deduction: -1.0 points)**: Uses bullet points as required, but recommendations are ordered differently (matching activities but swapped for first two), more generic, and less concrete/data-driven compared to GT. LLM's suggestions (e.g., "increase staffing or automate document checks") are vague alternatives without specifics like GT's "rule-based pre-checks for low-risk files" or "add one risk analyst to peak morning window." No bolding of activities in bullets, and lacks GT's projected impact (35% cycle time reduction), which adds executive value.

- **Length and Overall Fidelity (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: LLM is ~100 words, shorter than GT's ~150, and omits a concluding summary. Units ("seconds" vs. GT's "s") are inconsistent but minor. Core facts align, but cumulative differences in polish, specificity, and adherence to GT's professional style warrant a low-moderate score under strict evaluation.
