The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately flags the violation of Rule 3, which is the primary issue. However, it incorrectly claims a violation of Rule 2 (VP does occur after both QE and RA in the trace, satisfying the rule), introducing a factual error that misrepresents the ruleset. Additionally, it fails to reference or assess Rules 1 and 4 (both satisfied per ground truth), providing an incomplete justification despite the prompt's requirement to reference each rule. Under strict evaluation, these differences—especially the erroneous Rule 2 assessment—result in a moderate score, as the core decision is right but the reasoning has critical flaws.
