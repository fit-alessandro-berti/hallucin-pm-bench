8.0

The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth, but it contains a single (though important) error:

- For Q5, it incorrectly lists "Quality_Check" among activities that never appear as the first event of any case, when actually, for case C-77, "Quality_Check" is the first event. The rest ("Pack_Items" and "Ship_Order") are correct inclusions.

All other answers (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) are correct.

Given your instruction to apply utmost strictness and significant loss of points for small errors, this Q5 error reduces the answer significantly despite otherwise excellent performance. Thus, 8.0 is the warranted score.
