7.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, showing accurate extraction of distinct cases, preceding activity, earliest timestamp, and activity count. However, Q5 contains a significant error: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event for case C-77) and omits "Validate_Order" (which never starts a case), resulting in an incomplete and inaccurate list despite sharing two correct items ("Pack_Items" and "Ship_Order"). Under strict evaluation, this factual misrepresentation in one of five questions warrants a substantial deduction, yielding 7.0.
