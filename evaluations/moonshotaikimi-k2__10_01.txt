6.0

Reasoning:

**Terminology (Policy Adherence):**
- The LLM answer uses all three required synonyms: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance." ✅
- No forbidden terms are present. ✅

**Structure:**
- The matrix includes the six required activities.
- Uses role abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) rather than full names. Not strictly incorrect, but not as explicit as the ground truth.
- The order and labels for activities are correct except for not presenting explicit "Accountable" assignments.

**RACI Assignments:**
- The main fault is significant deviation from the ground truth in Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments:
    - "Accountable" (A) is entirely absent from the LLM matrix, while the ground truth specifies it in many fields, often combining "R/A" when the person is both. This is a major loss since RACI matrices require distinguishing R and A.
    - Some assignments differ, such as in "KYC Review," where ground truth has CO as R and A, LLM assigns C as R; and for "Order Vetting," ground truth has AM as R/A, but LLM only as R, and so on.
    - Several entries have multiple Cs and Is, where the ground truth uses fewer, and LLM sometimes assigns "Consulted" and "Informed" in places where the ground truth does not.

**Other details:**
- LLM answer gives definitions for R/A/C/I, which is technically harmless.
- All required activities (and no extra) are present, though abbreviations are used for roles.

**Summary:**
- Adheres strictly to terminology instructions, earns full marks here.
- Matrix and process steps are complete.
- BUT the RACI assignments deviate notably, and "Accountable" (A) is missing everywhere, a fundamental omission for a RACI matrix, which severely undermines precision and usefulness.
- Use of role abbreviations instead of names is a minor penalty.

Thus, the error in RACI assignments—especially omitting "Accountable"—is grave; significant deductions apply. Therefore, a strict 6.0 reflects that it is structurally correct with perfect terminology, but crucially incomplete and inaccurate in core responsibility mapping.
