### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary adherence (positive)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This aligns perfectly with the policy and ground truth.
- **Structure and format (partial credit)**: The response produces a basic RACI matrix with activities as rows and roles as columns, matching the prompt's core requirement. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced, satisfying the "unwarranted content" note. However, column headers use abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full names (Account Manager, etc.) as in the ground truth, which is a deviation from the expected presentation. Additionally, the ground truth includes bolding on key elements (e.g., **KYC Review**, **R / A** cells), which the LLM omits, reducing clarity and fidelity. The added title ("RACI Matrix â€“ FinCo Order-to-Cash") and definitions section introduce minor extraneous content not present in the ground truth, warranting a deduction.
- **RACI allocations (major failures)**: This is the dominant area of error, justifying severe point loss under strict evaluation. The ground truth ensures exactly one *Responsible* (R) per activity and assigns *Accountable* (A) roles appropriately (primarily to Account Manager for oversight, with R/A combined where the same role handles execution). The LLM fails catastrophically here:
  - No *Accountable* (A) assignments anywhere in the matrix, despite definitions mentioning A. This renders the matrix incomplete as a true RACI (missing a core element), directly contradicting the narrative where the primary handler (e.g., Account Manager for Receive Application) implies accountability.
  - Per-activity mismatches vs. ground truth (each is a significant error):
    - **Receive Application**: 3 differences (AM: R vs. R/A; CO: I vs. C; FC: C vs. I; IT: C vs. I). Only partial alignment on AM's R.
    - **KYC Review**: 2 differences (AM: C vs. A; FC: I vs. C). Correct on CO's R, but ignores AM's accountability.
    - **Order Vetting**: 1 difference (AM: R vs. R/A). Minor but still an omission of A.
    - **Payment Clearance**: 3 differences (AM: C vs. A; CO: I vs. C; IT: C vs. I). Correct on FC's R, but flawed consultations and missing A.
    - **Record Update**: 1 difference (AM: I vs. C). Correct on IT's R and FC's C, but ignores AM consultation.
    - **Notify Customer**: 1 difference (AM: R vs. R/A). Minor omission of A.
  - Total: 11 cell-level differences across activities, plus the systemic absence of A. These do not "reflect the narrative" as required (e.g., Account Manager's central accountability is underrepresented). Even small per-cell errors compound significantly under the strictness directive.
- **Overall correctness and self-awareness**: While terms are spot-on and there's no hallucinated content, the RACI logic is fundamentally inaccurate and incomplete, failing the core "Correctness" note. No self-awareness issues apply, but this doesn't offset the errors.
- **Scoring justification**: Base of 10 for correct structure/terms, minus 3 for header/formatting deviations, minus 4 for extraneous title/definitions, minus ~4 for RACI inaccuracies (scaled for per-cell and systemic issues). Strictness demands low tolerance for mismatches, especially missing A roles essential to RACI.
