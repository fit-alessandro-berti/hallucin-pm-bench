The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth in substance for all questions, with only a minor formatting difference in Q1 (omitting the explanatory case list and "cases" phrasing, which the question does not require). Under strict evaluation, this is negligible as the core responses are precise and concise as prompted.
