### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). Headings match the prompt's required format exactly. No speculation or extraneous details are included, and no "(none)" is needed.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Significant deductions (-2.0 total)**: Omitted task *names* (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" instead of just ID `check_vip`), which are explicitly in the XML and central to identifying elements factually. Ground truth includes both name and ID for clarity and completeness; using only IDs creates meaningful differences in informativeness and fidelity to XML content.
- **Minor deductions (-0.5 total)**: Lacks version specifics "(v1)" and "(v2)" in gateway change (factual and inferable from snippets). Added unrequired title "# BPMN Change Log Analysis". Subtle formatting differences (e.g., no bolding/backticks, - vs * bullets) deviate from ground truth's presentation, though not prompt-violating.

This results in a solid but incomplete match, penalizing for omissions and extras despite core accuracy.
