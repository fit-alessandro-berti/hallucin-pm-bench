The LLM answer fails critically on multiple fronts with utmost strictness: it outputs the full modified XML instead of a required single-hunk unified diff (major format violation); it proposes loosening `Task_GrantAccess` dueDate from P1D to P3D, which exacerbates potential SLA breaches by extending allowable time rather than tightening to meet a 3-day overall SLA as in the ground truth; and its rationale incorrectly justifies accommodating delays instead of enforcing compliance through reduction, resulting in zero alignment with the expected improvement to `Task_CollectEquipment` from P5D to P2D.
