The LLM answer deviates from the ground truth in several significant ways, warranting deductions under strict evaluation criteria. Structural differences include an extra task ("checks warranty eligibility") and corresponding sequence flow, altering the process flow (direct gateway connection in ground truth vs. intermediate task in LLM), which is not semantically equivalent despite being prompt-compliant. Task names differ consistently in verb forms (e.g., "validates the claim" vs. "Validate the claim"; "requests missing information" vs. "Request missing information") and capitalization (e.g., "update inventory records" vs. "Update inventory records"), violating verbatim matching relative to ground truth. Additional discrepancies: different start event name, named parallel gateways (unnamed in ground truth), divergent end event names, condition flow labels (e.g., "Incomplete"/"Complete" vs. "No"/"Yes"), extra XML attributes (incoming/outgoing refs and unused namespaces), and varying IDs/flow counts. These accumulate to substantial differences, though the LLM is more complete per the prompt's explicit elements. Minor elements like whitespace and line count also differ, contributing to loss.
