**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**:
  - Correctly identifies **3 decision points** (matches GT count).
  - **Amount threshold (#2)** is accurately located ("following/after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**") and logic mostly matches (> €1 000 → **Senior_Auditor_Review**; else → payment/skip).
  - **Required documents** list is **identical** (all 7 items, with accurate qualifiers like AuditTrail for high-value), earning full points here.
  - No introduction of undefined activities/artefacts.

- **Major Errors/Differences (significant deductions)**:
  - **Eligibility check (#1)**: Omits explicit rejection branch (*Not eligible* → rejected/returned, as in GT). LLM vaguely implies "proceed" but lacks full branching logic → -1.5 pts.
  - **Pre-approval/final approval (#3)**: Misplaced solely at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**; ignores **Senior_Auditor_Review** as part of "final payment approval" (GT combines both). Logic lacks rejection (*Rejected* → ends) and treats auditor as "verification, not decision" (contradicts GT's inclusion) → -1.0 pts.
  - **Incomplete branching**: Across #1/#3, no explicit *Approved/Rejected* outcomes (GT emphasizes these) → -0.5 pts.
  - **Extra content**: Unnecessary note dismissing **Senior_Auditor_Review** as non-decision; descriptive phrasing (e.g., "process diverts"); non-tabular/numbered structure deviates from GT's precise table/list → -0.3 pts.
  - Minor: €1,000 vs €1 000 (formatting); adds intro/header phrasing not in GT → -0.2 pts.

- **Overall**: ~75% alignment (strong docs, weak decisions). Strict penalty for content omissions/mischaracterizations yields 7.2 (not 8+ due to decision logic gaps).
