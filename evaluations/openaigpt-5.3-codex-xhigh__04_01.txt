9.2

The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying the same overall non-compliance due to violations of Rules 2 and 3, with all five rules properly assessed (satisfied or violated) matching the ground truth. Event citations, logic, and rule interpretations align perfectly (e.g., Rule 3 correctly notes #10 exceeds #7–#8 window, equivalent to ground truth's distance note despite minor semantic variance in "distance=3").

Point deductions (-0.8 total) for small but noticeable differences under strict evaluation:
- Stylistic/formatting variances: Extra bolding (**), descriptive parentheticals (e.g., "(PO > €10,000 approvals)"), and inconsistent rule headers vs. ground truth's uniform "**Rule X — Status.**" (-0.3).
- Phrasing/wording variations: e.g., "breached" vs. "violated"; "wrong order" vs. "order is reversed"; "timing exceeds...distance" vs. "exceeding...window"; repeated conclusion at end (-0.3).
- Rule 4 justification slightly less detailed (no explicit event refs like "event 7" or "event 4 in between") vs. ground truth (-0.2).

No factual errors, omissions, or logic flaws; differences are superficial and do not alter meaning or compliance verdict.
