6.0

**Justification:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM lists all required documents correctly and does not introduce any extra artefacts or steps.
- The main decision points are generally identified and all necessary documents are mentioned.

**Errors / Deviations:**
1. **Decision Points Detail**
   - The LLM combines and simplifies decision points, failing to reflect the explicit three distinct decision points from the ground truth. Specifically:
     - Decision point 1 (eligibility check) detail about outcomes (eligible/not eligible) is missing.
     - Decision point 2 (amount threshold) is mentioned, but the outcome logic ("include reviewer / skip") isn't explicit.
     - The critical decision about payment proceeding or process ending depending on approval or rejection (decision point 3) is missing entirely.
   - The LLM fails to clearly specify the explicit branching logic or outcomes for each point, as requested.
2. **Document Context**
   - While all documents are listed, the LLM does not clarify conditionality (i.e., AuditTrail is only for claims > â‚¬1 000), though it is at least included.
3. **Instructions**
   - The summary does not explicitly state that no additional activities or artefacts are included, whereas ground truth is explicit.
4. **Clarity and Structure**
   - The ground truth provides a clear, tabular structure with outcomes and logic, making the answer much clearer. The LLM response lacks this structured, detailed approach.

**Conclusion:**  
The LLM answer is adequate in terms of listing steps and documents, but lacks precision on branching logic, conditionality, and decision outcomes required by the prompt. These are significant, content-related misses, justifying a 4-point deduction.
