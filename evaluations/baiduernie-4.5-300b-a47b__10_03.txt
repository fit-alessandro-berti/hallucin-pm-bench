3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (partial credit, +2.0)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) exactly as specified in the table headers, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms from the narrative. This adheres to the strict policy.
- **Completeness of Activities (-3.0 significant deduction)**: The prompt requires covering "every activity and role described above" in the narrative, which includes escalation/approval and fund release/notification implicitly as distinct steps. The LLM only includes the four core activities and omits "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds," failing to fully map the process. The ground truth expands to six activities to achieve this coverage, highlighting the LLM's incompleteness despite the "do not add activities" clause (which conflicts with full coverage—LLM interprets too narrowly).
- **RACI Assignments Accuracy (major errors, -2.0)**: Assignments partially align but have multiple inaccuracies compared to ground truth:
  - Intake Vetting: Misses Consulted (Compliance Analyst); incorrectly lists Informed as Treasury Ops (matches, but overall incomplete).
  - KYC Review: Consulted incorrectly as Front-Office Analyst (ground truth: Compliance Officer); Responsible/Accountable correct but partial.
  - AML Screening: Combines with KYC incorrectly (narrative separates); Consulted as Front-Office (wrong, ground truth has Compliance Officer); Informed entry is messy/non-standard ("Risk Team*" with explanation, violating clean output).
  - Risk Scoring: Responsible/Accountable partially correct, but Consulted as Treasury Ops (wrong, ground truth: Front-Office Analyst); Informed as Front-Office (matches but inverted).
  No coverage for the missing activities exacerbates this.
- **Table Format and Structure (-1.0)**: Uses R/A/C/I as columns (a valid RACI variant) but diverges from ground truth's role-based columns with letters in cells (e.g., "R, A"). This makes direct comparison harder and doesn't match the expected output style. Dashes (–) for no involvement are absent, and cells like AML Informed are cluttered.
- **Extra Content and Cleanliness (-0.5)**: Includes an unprompted footnote with explanations, "Risk Team*" (a non-roster role, implying unauthorized addition), and parenthetical notes. Prompt specifies only the Markdown table, so this violates "return the matrix as a Markdown table" by adding interpretive text.
- **Overall Strictness**: Even minor issues (e.g., format mismatch, extra text) warrant deductions per instructions. The LLM captures the core vocabulary but fundamentally fails on process coverage, accuracy, and output purity, resulting in a low score despite partial adherence.
