3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of core decision (Yes/No):** The LLM correctly answers "No," aligning with the ground truth that the FACT is inaccurate. This earns baseline credit (+2.0 points).
- **Justification quality and completeness:** The ground truth provides a exhaustive, case-by-case analysis of all 4 relevant cases (C001–C004), clearly identifying intervening activities (e.g., Pack_Items in C002, Check_Fraud in C004) and concluding based on violations of the "always" claim. The LLM only cites one case (C004), ignoring C002 entirely—a major omission that fails to demonstrate full reliance on the log evidence (+0.5 points partial credit for mentioning one counterexample).
- **Accuracy of cited evidence:** The LLM mischaracterizes C004 by focusing on a "15-minute gap" as evidence of non-immediacy, but the FACT concerns *activity sequence* (no other activities in between), not timestamps. It overlooks the explicit intervening "Check_Fraud" at 10:07, incorrectly implying the gap alone proves the point without other activities. This introduces a factual error about the log contents (-1.5 points deduction for inaccuracy).
- **Strictness for small errors:** Per instructions, the justification's incompleteness (missing C002), lack of structured evidence (no sequence listing or notes on all cases), and subtle misrepresentation of the log (time vs. activity focus) warrant significant deductions, as they deviate substantially from the ground truth's meticulous, evidence-based format.
- **Overall structure and adherence to task:** The LLM follows the task's structure (Yes/No + justification with CaseIDs/sequences) minimally but lacks depth and precision, making it far less reliable as a "meticulous process-mining analyst" response.
