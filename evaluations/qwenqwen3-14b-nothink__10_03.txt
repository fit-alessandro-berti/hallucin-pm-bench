3.0

The LLM answer shows effort toward conforming to the strict vocabulary policy, but there are substantial issues that depart from the ground truth and from the prompt requirements, leading to a significant loss of points. A detailed breakdown:

**Vocabulary compliance:**
- The four required terms are present: "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring". No synonyms or forbidden terms are visible in the matrix—the minimum requirement is met.

**Activity Naming:**
- Several activities are renamed or merged, violating the instruction to "do not rename, merge, or add activities":
    - “Approval (Risk >70)” is not in the ground truth or original process steps and is an improper merge/renaming of the approval step.
    - “Payment Execution” and “Notification” are not authorized; the correct activities in the ground truth are “Release Funds” and “Notification” does not map exactly.
    - “Compliance Officer Approval” as a discrete activity is missing by name.

**Role assignments (RACI):**
- The answer omits columns (uses blank cells instead of –), making roles’ involvement ambiguous.
- Uses only singular "Responsible" or "Accountable" tags; does not combine "R, A" where required or use other designations (no "Consulted" or "Informed"), leading to loss of important detail.
    - E.g., for “Intake Vetting”, should be "R, A" for Front-Office Analyst, but only "Responsible" is marked.
    - For “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”: should be "R, A" for Compliance Analyst; only "Responsible" is marked.
    - “Risk Scoring”: Compliance Officer should be "A", not missing.
    - "Consulted" and "Informed" roles are fully omitted from the matrix, a major deficiency compared to the ground truth.

**Matrix structure:**
- The output uses an incorrect structure (wrong activities, incomplete RACI assignments, missing information) compared to the ground truth.
- Misses interactions/consultation between roles entirely.

**Formatting:**
- Markdown table is output as requested, which is appropriate.

**Summary:**
Despite correct use of required vocabulary and output format, the answer fails to:
- Follow all required activity names and granularity.
- Assign R, A, C, I responsively for each role and activity.
- Respect the “do not rename, merge, or add activities” policy.

These errors are significant and prevent the answer from being of high professional standard or fit for purpose. A strict assessment places this at 3.0.
