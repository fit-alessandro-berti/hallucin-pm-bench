The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by using the four mandated terms exactly without synonyms or leaks, which is a strength. However, it fails significantly in other areas under strict evaluation:

- **Activities**: The prompt instructs to cover *every activity and role described* without renaming, merging, or adding activities, while using only authorized vocabulary. The narrative implies six distinct steps (vetting, KYC/CDD, AML/sanctions, risk scoring, approval/escalation, release/notification), but the LLM incorrectly adds and renames activities ("Approval (Risk >70)", "Payment Execution", "Notification") instead of aligning precisely with the ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". This introduces unauthorized additions and phrasing, diverging from the narrative's flow (e.g., notification is not a standalone activity but integrated). No merging or exact coverage of all described steps occurs, leading to incomplete representation. Major deduction for this.

- **RACI Assignments**: The assignments are overly simplistic and inaccurate compared to the ground truth's nuanced use of R, A, C, I (including multiples like "R, A" and explicit "–" for no involvement). Examples of errors:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Captures only "Responsible" for Front-Office Analyst; misses "A" for the same role, "C" for Compliance Analyst, and "I" for Treasury Ops.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: Only "Responsible" for Compliance Analyst; misses "A" for the same, "C" for Compliance Officer, and "I" for Treasury Ops.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Incorrectly assigns only "Responsible" to Compliance Analyst; ground truth has "C" for Front-Office, "R" for Compliance Analyst, "A" for Compliance Officer, and "I" for Treasury Ops.
  - Added activities: "Approval (Risk >70)" only "Accountable" for Compliance Officer (misses "R, A" and others); "Payment Execution" only "Responsible" for Treasury Ops (misses "A" and C/I for others); "Notification" incorrectly standalone with "Responsible" for Treasury Ops (not in ground truth as separate).
  These omissions and inaccuracies ignore the consultative/informative roles across the process, fundamentally undermining the RACI purpose. Even small mismatches (e.g., missing "I" or "C") warrant significant point loss per instructions.

- **Format**: Markdown table is used, but lacks ground truth's bolding conventions (e.g., **R, A**), uses blanks instead of "–" for no involvement, and includes extraneous parenthetical details in activity names. Minor but deducted.

Overall, while the core vocabulary is handled correctly, the matrix does not faithfully reconstruct the described process's RACI dynamics, resulting in a low score despite partial alignment on primary responsibilities.
