9.0

### Evaluation Notes:
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the core solution—adding an interrupting boundary timer event on `Activity_CreateAccount` with a 48-hour duration (`PT48H`) and routing it via a sequence flow to the pre-existing `Activity_AMReview` without new activities. The justification is semantically identical in intent and structure (one sentence explaining enforcement via escalation to the existing task), fully addressing the SLA context tied to "Verify Identity" completion.
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness)**: Minor XML differences include missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<bpmn:timeDuration>` (required for BPMN 2.0 schema compliance in formal expressions), absence of a `name` attribute on the boundary event, different arbitrary IDs (`TimerEvent_01` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`; `Flow_09` vs. `Flow_LateEscalation`), and lack of explanatory comments (e.g., <!-- ❶ -->). Justification wording varies slightly (e.g., full task name "Create Account in Core System" vs. abbreviated "**Create Account**"; adds "for escalation" not in ground truth; no bolding or exact phrasing like "pre-existing" or "routing the timeout"). These small discrepancies, while not functionally breaking, warrant a 1.0-point deduction under utmost strictness for non-exact matching.
