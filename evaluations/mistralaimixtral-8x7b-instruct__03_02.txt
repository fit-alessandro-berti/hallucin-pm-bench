**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
The LLM answer deviates substantially from both the textual description and the ground truth JSON in structure, logic, and fidelity. Key errors (each warranting major point deductions under "utmost strictness"):

- **Structural mismatch (major penalty)**: Uses verbose BPMN-XML-like schema (e.g., `tasks`, `sequenceFlows`, `incoming`/`outgoing` arrays) vs. ground truth's concise `elements`/`flows` with explicit types/conditions. No `process_id`, wrong top-level keys. This alone halves the score.

- **Missing/incorrect flow logic (critical failures)**:
  - No start event; begins with task "Receive Support Email" (vs. ground truth `startEvent`).
  - "Initial Classification" task branches directly (no `exclusiveGateway` like `classifyDecision` with `simple`/`complex` conditions).
  - **No "Provide Resolution" on complex path**: Root Cause → straight to wait (hallucinates skip; textual requires "before resolution").
  - **Broken parallel**: Direct splits from Provide Resolution to Send/Log (no `parallelGateway` fork/join like `forkLogging`/`joinAfterLogging`); simple path dead-ends before wait; no synchronization.
  - **Incorrect wait/timer**: Single `IntermediateCatchEvent` on wait (with `timeDuration`); lacks `eventBasedGateway` + separate `message`/`timer` catch events. Only on complex path.
  - **Wrong post-timer**: Reminder → "Terminate" (misuses as normal end; textual: "Send Reminder *once* and then Close Ticket"). Orphan "Close Ticket (Reminder)" task.
  - **No customer cancel**: Completely absent (textual point 10 requires `intermediateCatchEvent` → `terminateEndEvent` like ground truth).

- **Minor but penalized errors**: Inconsistent task types (`None`/`UserTask`); combined "Parse Email & Create Ticket"; no flow conditions; incomplete `sequenceFlows` (last truncated); simple path never reaches wait/close; "Terminate" as regular `EndEvent`.

~70% of ground truth logic absent/broken; hallucinates flows (e.g., reminder→terminate). Partial credit for basic task names/sequence (~20% match), but strict rules demand near-exact fidelity. No escalation invented (minor plus, no gain).
