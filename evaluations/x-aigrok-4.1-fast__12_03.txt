The LLM answer is fully accurate, correctly answers **No**, and justifies by citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001, C002, C003, C004) with precise activity sequences and timestamps where needed, identifying both compliant cases and the two counterexamples (C002: Pack_Items intervenes; C004: Check_Fraud intervenes) that refute the "always" claim. No factual errors, omissions, or deviations from the ground truth content; minor presentational differences (text vs. table) do not impact correctness or completeness per the task requirements.
