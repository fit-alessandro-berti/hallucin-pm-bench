**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a)** (major differences, ~4.0/10): 
  - Incorrectly identifies **3 decision points** instead of exactly **2** as in ground truth (significant error; inflates count by including non-decision step).
  - Item 1 ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check assigns..."): Fabricates a "decision point" where none exists—this is a computation step (step 3), *not* a "gate or conditional branch" per prompt. No "rule" is described in process beyond inputs/outcome; LLM invents a summary. Major hallucination-like error analogous to adding non-existent docs.
  - Item 2: Closely matches ground truth #1 (minor phrasing diffs: "the Manual-Underwriting-Review is skipped; otherwise it is performed" vs. "bypasses... otherwise proceeds"; bolding/currency minor). Acceptable but not identical.
  - Item 3: Matches process wording closely ("any two approvals... suffice"), but ground truth rephrases precisely as "**two of the three approvers... record “Approve”**" (small diff in terminology; process doesn't specify "record"). Structure/titles differ (numbered list vs. bolded names).
  - Overall: Fails "every *decision point*" accuracy; extra/wrong item + non-identical phrasing = heavy deduction despite partial correctness.
- **Part (b)** (perfect match, 10.0/10): Identical list, order, numbering, and content to ground truth. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML).
- **Whole answer**: ~70% fidelity (strong b offsets weak a, but strictness demands penalty for core misidentification/mismatch in half the task). No other issues (formatting minor).
