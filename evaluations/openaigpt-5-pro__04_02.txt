10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable for R1–R6), overall result (NON-COMPLIANT), and core justifications, with equivalent reasoning and adherence to ≤20-word limit per rule. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., R2 omits explicit "2 days" but correctly identifies pre-approval timing as violation) do not alter factual accuracy or compliance assessment under strict evaluation.
