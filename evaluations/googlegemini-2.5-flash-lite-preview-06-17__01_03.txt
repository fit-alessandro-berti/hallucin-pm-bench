**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM answer correctly lists the two main decision points:
  - The risk-based conditional branch after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (though it labels the check itself as a decision point, which is arguably misleading, since only the conditional branch and the TriVote gate were required by the prompt/ground truth).
  - The TriVote approval gate, with correct rule.

**Errors/Deficiencies:**
- The LLM treats the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a decision point, but the ground truth considers the *skip* after it as the true decision point. This over-specification is a minor, not major, error.
- Both rules in the LLM answer are accurate, but the conditional-branch description is a bit less precise than the ground truth's careful handling of the conditions (“the Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5) is skipped” is less precise than “the process bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise it proceeds to that review”).
- The phrase "The loan passes if..." for TriVote is a little less explicit than "the loan may advance only when at least two of the three approvers...", but the substance is present.

**b) Documents**

- The LLM lists: Form 14B, Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025.
- The LLM misses “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” which is a unique required document per the process.
- The order is otherwise correct for those listed.
- Listing only Offer Sheet 77, not distinguishing it from the *Signed* version used later, is a non-trivial omission, since these are distinct process artifacts.

**No hallucination is present; there is no mention of KYC/AML/Credit reports.**

**Summary of Deductions:**
- -1.5: Omission of “Signed Offer Sheet 77”
- -0.5: Over-interpretation of decision points (describing Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a gate)
- -1.0: Loss of precision in explanations at two small points

**Final Score:** **7.0**
