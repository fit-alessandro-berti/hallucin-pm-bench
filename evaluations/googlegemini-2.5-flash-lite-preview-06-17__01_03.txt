### Evaluation Reasoning
**Part (a) Assessment (Decision Points):**  
The LLM correctly identifies the two main decision points from the ground truth but introduces an extraneous third one ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check" as a decision point), which is not a gate or conditional branchâ€”it's merely a step that generates an input for the actual conditional (Step 4). This is a clear error, as the ground truth explicitly lists only the risk-based skip and TriVote. The summary for the conditional branch is mostly accurate but omits the "otherwise" implication (proceeding to review), slightly deviating from the ground truth's phrasing. The TriVote summary is close but less precise (e.g., ground truth specifies "record 'Approve'" and "the loan may advance only when," emphasizing the exact rule). This adds inaccuracy and incompleteness, warranting a deduction (partial credit for the two correct points, but penalized for the hallucinated extra and phrasing differences). Sub-score: 5.0/10.

**Part (b) Assessment (Documents):**  
The list is mostly correct in order and includes 8 of the 9 ground truth items, accurately reflecting first appearances up to "Deck Memo." However, it misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document in Step 8 (listed separately in ground truth to distinguish from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in Step 7), resulting in an incomplete enumeration and slight order shift for subsequent items. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), which avoids further penalty. This is a small but significant omission under strict criteria, as the prompt requires *all* documents. Sub-score: 8.0/10.

**Overall:** Weighted average (equal parts), with strictness applied for differences in completeness, accuracy, and fidelity to ground truth phrasing/structure. No major criminal/jailbreak issues, but evaluation is purely on match quality.
