The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt's requirement for a single explanatory sentence, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps/durations as the blocker. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; omission of "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals" details), per utmost strictness on differences.
