The LLM answer is correct, complete, and aligns precisely with the ground truth in answering "Yes" to Q1, providing the identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5), and explaining the enabling path for T5 without firing T3. Markings and logic match exactly, with no errors or omissions. Minor formatting differences (e.g., no subscript markings, added title) do not impact accuracy or conciseness (explanation <120 words).
