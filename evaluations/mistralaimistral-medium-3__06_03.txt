The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, matching the ground truth in content, order, and numbering. It adheres to the prompt by focusing solely on Process B without referencing A or C. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., bullet-point formatting and "Parallel Split" headers versus ground truth's "Set" phrasing and â€– notation) and lack of the explicit "No other tasks" closure, which slightly deviates from exact replication under strict evaluation.
