9.5

- The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth and all facts are correct.
- Very minor issue: the LLM formatted Cancel_Order (A3) without the backslash (“\”) as in the ground truth (“Pack\_Items” vs. “Pack_Items”) and also included an extra period (.) at the end of answers 2 and 3.
- Overall, main facts and logic are 100% correct, but minor formatting/cosmetic differences should be penalized under strict grading.
