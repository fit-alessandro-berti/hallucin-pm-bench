8.0

- **Q1 match:** Near-perfect (correct count and cases listed), minor deduction for adding "distinct" (unnecessary verbosity vs. ground truth's exact phrasing).
- **Q2 match:** Core answer correct (Pack_Items), but significant deduction for extraneous explanatory text ("immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case C456"), violating conciseness; lacks A2 labeling.
- **Q3 match:** Core answer correct (Cancel_Order), but deduction for added phrase ("appears exactly once"), again less concise; lacks A3 labeling.
- **Overall format:** Bullets used (good), but no A1/A2/A3 labels as in ground truth, and general verbosity reduces fidelity to "concise, bullet-point answers only." Content accuracy is high, but strict evaluation penalizes all differences.
