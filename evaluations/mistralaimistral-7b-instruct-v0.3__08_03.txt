**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on every key aspect: it wrongly concludes "no" (vs. ground truth "yes"), provides no valid firing sequence (ground truth gives a specific shortest one: T1,T2b,T4,T5,...), and offers deeply flawed reasoning with factual errors about the net (e.g., falsely claims T2b outputs to pc; misattributes pe dependency to feedback loop). This inverts the correct logic of the shortcut (T2b skips pc) and feedback (T6 enables T3 post-T5), showing total misunderstanding of the provided net. No partial credit possible under strict criteria.
