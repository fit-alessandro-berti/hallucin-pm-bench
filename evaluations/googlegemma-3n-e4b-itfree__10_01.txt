4.0

**Justification:**

*Strict vocabulary enforcement:*  
- The LLM correctly avoids the forbidden terms and uses “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” with the right spelling and capitalization. This part is well executed.

*Major issues:*
- The RACI assignments are **highly incorrect** compared to the provided ground truth. Almost every row misassigns “Responsible” and completely omits “Accountable”, “Consulted”, and “Informed”.

**Specific errors:**
- For **Receive Application**, only “R” is given to Account Manager. In ground truth, Account Manager is both R/A, while CO is Consulted, FC and IT are Informed. None of the C or I assignments are shown.
- For **KYC Review**, the LLM assigns both AM and CO as “R.” In the ground truth, CO is Responsible, AM is only Accountable, FC is Consulted, and IT is Informed.
- For **Order Vetting**, only “R” for AM is used. In reality, AM is R/A, CO is C, FC and IT are I.
- For **Payment Clearance**, only FC gets “R”, missing A for AM, C for CO, and I for IT.
- For **Record Update**, only IT gets “R”; ground truth is R for IT, C for AM/FC, I for CO.
- For **Notify Customer**, only AM gets “R”; ground truth assigns AM R/A, all others as I.

*Other issues:*
- The LLM provides a full RACI legend (which is ok) but does not show any “A”, “C”, or “I” assignments in the matrix.
- In the matrix, wrongly places two “R”s for KYC Review (“R” in AM and CO instead of dividing A/R), violating standard RACI usage (one A, one R per task).

*Summary:*
- It uses proper vocabulary (which avoids worse penalties).
- But the RACI is so incomplete (nearly all A, C, and I assignments are missing or misassigned), making the matrix functionally useless in a real workflow context.

**Reasoning for score:**  
Full marks for vocabulary, but major loss for RACI execution: missing almost all C, A, and I assignments, overuse of “R” (sometimes duplicate), and generally failing to follow the detailed ground truth mappings.  

**Conclusion:** 4.0 — since the basic vocabulary is correct, but the structural requirements of the RACI are overwhelmingly failed, and even “Responsible” is wrongly duplicated at one point.
