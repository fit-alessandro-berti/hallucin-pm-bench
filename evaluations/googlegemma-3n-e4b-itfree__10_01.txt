3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology Adherence (Strong)**: The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" as mandated, with exact capitalization and no mention of forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). This aligns perfectly with the vocabulary policy and ground truth. (+3.0 points)
- **Structure and Format (Partial)**: Basic table format is present with all six activities as rows and the four roles as columns. However, it uses abbreviations (e.g., "AM") in the table headers instead of full names as in the ground truth, adds an unwarranted title ("Order-to-Cash Workflow RACI Matrix") and a full RACI Key explanation (not present in ground truth), and lacks bolding on key terms/roles (e.g., no **KYC Review**). These are extraneous additions and deviations, violating "no extra tasks, roles, or columns" implicitly and adding unnecessary content. (-1.5 points from potential)
- **RACI Allocations (Major Failures)**: This is the core deficiency. The ground truth provides a complete RACI with one Responsible (R) per activity, Accountable (A) assignments (often to Account Manager), and appropriate Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles, reflecting inferred narrative involvement. The LLM:
  - Only assigns a single entry per row (mostly R), ignoring A, C, and I entirelyâ€”resulting in incomplete matrices for every activity.
  - Incorrectly assigns two R's for "KYC Review" (AM and CO), violating the "exactly one Responsible per activity" rule.
  - Misses key ground truth elements, e.g.:
    - "Receive Application": LLM only AM R; ground truth AM R/A, CO C, FC I, IT I.
    - "Order Vetting": LLM only AM R; ground truth AM R/A, CO C, FC I, IT I.
    - "Payment Clearance": LLM only FC R; ground truth AM A, CO C, FC R, IT I.
    - "Record Update": LLM only IT R; ground truth AM C, CO I, FC C, IT R.
    - Similar omissions for others, with no A or supporting roles.
  These are not minor; they fundamentally misrepresent the RACI, failing "reflect the narrative" and "Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate." (-6.0 points; severe as it's the prompt's main deliverable)
- **Overall Correctness and Strictness**: No extra activities/roles introduced, but the response is overly simplistic and non-compliant in substance. Under utmost strictness, even partial correctness in terminology can't offset the wholesale inaccuracy in RACI logic and completeness. Total reflects ~35% alignment (terms + skeleton structure).
