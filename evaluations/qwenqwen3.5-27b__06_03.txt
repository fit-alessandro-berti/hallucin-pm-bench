The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the exact two concurrent task sets from Process B in order, with precise task names matching the ground truth content. Minor deductions for: (1) using commas instead of ‖ symbol for parallelism notation (-0.4); (2) lacking descriptive labels, bolding, backticks, and final confirmatory sentence (-0.4). Core functional match is excellent and fully prompt-compliant.
