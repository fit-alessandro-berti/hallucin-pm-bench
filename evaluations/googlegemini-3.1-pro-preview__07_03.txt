The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with correct identification of all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), removed task (Task_ManualReview), and gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel; Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel). Headings are verbatim, order correct, no extra commentary, and format matches the prompt's example precisely (e.g., "id: old → new" with standard spacing after colon).

The sole difference is minor formatting: the ground truth includes ~5 alignment spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel") to column-align "exclusive" with the line above, which the LLM lacks (using single space). This cosmetic whitespace discrepancy is a small error but deducts 0.5 points under utmost strictness for non-exact text match, despite not affecting verifiability or required specification (prompt example has no such alignment).
