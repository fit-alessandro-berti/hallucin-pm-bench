4.0

- **Terminology**: The LLM uses only the approved terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") and avoids all forbidden terms. This is correct and prevents a much lower score.
- **Format**: The RACI matrix is presented correctly with activities as rows and roles as columns.

**Major errors:**
- **RACI Assignment Errors**:
    - **Receive Application**: Should be "R/A" for Account Manager, and "C", "I", "I" for the other roles. LLM gave only "R" to Account Manager and left all others blank. No consideration of Consultation (C) or Inform (I) roles.
    - **KYC Review**: LLM assigns only "R" to Compliance Officer and leaves others blank. GT: Compliance Officer is "R", but Account Manager should be "A", Finance Clerk "C", IT "I".
    - **Order Vetting**: GT: Account Manager is "R/A", Compliance Officer "C", Finance "I", IT "I". LLM: Only "R" for AM, all others blank.
    - **Payment Clearance**: GT: Finance Clerk is "R", Account Manager "A", Compliance "C", IT "I". LLM: Only "R" for FC, all others blank.
    - **Record Update**: GT: IT "R", FC "C", AM "C", CO "I". LLM: Only "R" for IT.
    - **Notify Customer**: GT: AM "R/A", others "I". LLM: Only "R" for AM.
- **Does not distinguish "Accountable" (A) anywhere**. R/A is important in the GT and missing throughout in the LLM answer.
- **Missing C and I roles everywhere**.

**Conclusion:**
- The LLM successfully uses the correct terms, but RACI assignments are grossly oversimplified and mostly incomplete—only single "R" per task, with no A, C, or I roles provided, drastically reducing process mapping accuracy.
- This is a severe process-mapping error that should be significantly penalized.

**Result**: 4.0 — Correct terminology and table structure, but fundamentally incorrect and incomplete RACI allocations on every row.
