**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major omission (primary deduction: -5.0 points)**: The LLM answer identifies only **one** concurrent set (the first parallel split: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory), completely missing the **second** parallel construct (Generate_Replenishment_Report ‖ Notify_Procurement). The user prompt explicitly requires listing "**each set**" of concurrent tasks from **all** parallel constructs in Process B, numbered in order. Ground truth correctly lists **both** sets (1 and 2). This halves the required content.
- **Formatting and precision errors (-0.5 each, total -1.0)**:
  - Uses "and" instead of ‖ symbol for concurrency notation.
  - Lacks descriptive labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**".
  - No closing statement like "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel."
- **Extra/unwanted content (-0.5)**: Includes unnecessary parenthetical explanation ("*(These two tasks are on the || Parallel Split #1 || branch and can execute concurrently.)*"), which goes beyond a simple list and introduces minor inaccuracy ("branch" singular vs. plural branches).
- **Partial correctness (+1.0 base)**: Correctly identifies the first set, numbers it "1.", focuses solely on Process B, and avoids mentioning A/C.
- **Overall**: Starts at 10.0, deducts heavily for incompleteness (core requirement violated) and precision issues. No leniency for "small" errors per instructions.
