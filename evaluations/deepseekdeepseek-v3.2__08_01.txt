**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (matching the ground truth's "Yes"), provides a valid, concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing in a reachable marking where T3 has not yet fired (p2=1 still holds the token for T3), with accurate markings and brief justification focused on the inhibitor arc condition (p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0). This precisely fulfills the prompt's requirements without errors.

Minor differences (significant under utmost strictness, deducting 1.0 total):
- Sequence is shorter (stops correctly after T5; does not explicitly fire T3 afterward or include invalid T4 as ground truth erroneously does).
- Lacks ground truth's stronger claim ("must fire before T3 if it occurs") and deeper proof (permanence of disablement post-T3, exhaustive enabling conditions).
- Slightly less formal formatting (no inline transition labels/markings or full post-T3 context).
- No factual errors, unlike ground truth's invalid T4 firing (p3=0).

High similarity in core content, but strict deduction for omitted depth/detail despite matching "briefly."
