3.2

### Evaluation Rationale
Evaluating with utmost strictness as instructed, I compared the LLM answer to the ground truth across key criteria: adherence to mandated vocabulary, coverage and mapping of tasks from the source text, RACI assignments, table structure/clarity, and overall fidelity without additions/omissions/substitutions. Significant deductions for every deviation, as even small errors (e.g., forbidden terms or minor mismatches) warrant substantial point loss. Total differences are extensive, leading to a low score.

#### 1. **Vocabulary Mandate Adherence** (Major Violation; -4.0 points base deduction)
   - **Mandated terms not used exclusively**: The prompt requires *only* “KYC Review” for due diligence activities, “Regulatory Liaison” for “Compliance Officer”, and “Transaction Analyst” for “Payment Clerk”/similar. LLM repeatedly violates this:
     - Uses "Compliance Officer" 3 times (forbidden; should be "Regulatory Liaison").
     - Includes "customer due diligence" in task name (forbidden; should be purely "KYC Review").
     - Misuses “KYC Review” as a *role* (e.g., Responsible for Log, Screen, Conduct KYC, Release) instead of an *activity/task*—fundamental error, treating an activity term as a role.
     - Never uses "Transaction Analyst" at all (source maps "payment clerk" to this; LLM defaults to wrong/invented roles like "KYC Review").
   - Ground truth correctly uses “KYC Review” as task, “Regulatory Liaison” and “Transaction Analyst” as roles, with no forbidden terms.
   - **Impact**: This is a core requirement ("follow strictly in every output"). Multiple instances = severe deduction; alone justifies <5.0 score.

#### 2. **Task Coverage and Mapping** (Partial Match with Errors; -1.5 points)
   - **Source text tasks (6 steps)**: LLM covers most (Log, Screen, KYC, Approve, Release, Send SWIFT, Archive = 7 entries, but with overlaps/duplications). However:
     - Splits "receives and logs" into "Log payment instruction" (not in ground truth; ground has single "Receive").
     - Adds "escalate" to Approve (source says only "approve"; unnecessary addition).
     - "Release payment release instruction" has duplication/typo error.
     - Covers "Send SWIFT" explicitly (good, as source has it; ground truth omits it entirely, folding into "Release" implicitly via IT C).
   - Ground truth maps: Receive (combines log/receive), Screen, KYC Review, Approve, Release, Archive (misses explicit Send SWIFT; 6 tasks).
   - **Differences**: LLM more complete but with inaccuracies (e.g., "Conduct KYC Review (customer due diligence)" includes forbidden phrase). Ground truth uses precise mandated wording (e.g., "**KYC Review**" bolded). Small mapping errors (e.g., no exact "Receive" in LLM) deduct points.

#### 3. **RACI Assignments** (Poor Fidelity; -1.8 points)
   - LLM assignments are largely incoherent/wrong due to role misuse:
     - E.g., Log: KYC Review (R) — invalid role; source is clerk (should map to Transaction Analyst R, per ground truth).
     - Screen: KYC Review (R), Compliance Officer (A) — wrong roles; ground truth has Transaction Analyst (R), Regulatory Liaison (A).
     - KYC: KYC Review (R), Compliance Officer (A) — again, misuses activity as role; ground truth has Regulatory Liaison (R), Operations Manager (A).
     - Approve: Compliance Officer (R), "Accountable" (A) — "Accountable" is not a role (nonsense); duplicates "Regulatory Liaison" in Consulted; ground truth: Regulatory Liaison (R), Operations Manager (A).
     - Release: KYC Review (R) — wrong; ground truth: Transaction Analyst (R).
     - Send: IT Support (R), "Accountable" (A) — invalid; not in ground truth.
     - Archive: IT Support (R), "Accountable" (A) — partial match (IT R per ground), but wrong A.
     - Consulted/Informed often empty or illogical (e.g., duplicates, includes forbidden roles).
   - Ground truth uses consistent roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) with clear R/A/C/I letters, mapping source directly (e.g., clerk → Transaction Analyst R for Receive/Screen/Release; CO → Regulatory Liaison R/A for KYC/Approve; IT → R for Archive, C/I elsewhere).
   - **Differences**: LLM's assignments don't align with source mappings or ground truth in ~80% of cells (wrong roles, empties, inventions like "Accountable"). Even where partial overlap (e.g., IT for Send/Archive), vocabulary errors compound issues.

#### 4. **Table Structure and Clarity** (Inadequate; -0.5 points)
   - LLM: Vertical format (tasks in rows, R/A/C/I columns with role names filled)—valid RACI style, but cluttered (e.g., duplicates, typos, non-role entries). Adds explanatory *Legend* with full descriptions (unnecessary; bloats output).
   - Ground truth: Horizontal roles as columns, tasks as rows, compact letters (R/A/C/I)—cleaner, with simple **Legend** and mandated task wording (e.g., bold "**KYC Review**").
   - **Differences**: LLM's format works but is less organized (full phrases vs. letters); extra legend mismatches ground truth's brevity. No Markdown issues in either, but clarity loss from errors.

#### Overall Score Calculation
- Base (perfect match): 10.0
- Vocabulary failures (core violation, multiple instances): -4.0 → 6.0
- Task/RACI mismatches (incomplete/wrong mappings, ~70% divergence): -2.0 → 4.0
- Structure/minor errors (typos, additions like escalate/Accountable): -0.8 → 3.2
- No credit for extras (e.g., covering Send SWIFT) as they don't offset violations; ground truth sets the benchmark, and LLM deviates more than it aligns.

This score reflects strict penalization: The LLM answer fundamentally fails the vocabulary mandate (a "strictly" enforced rule), rendering it non-compliant despite some task coverage. Ground truth, while imperfect (e.g., added "Operations Manager", omitted Send), adheres better to mandates.
