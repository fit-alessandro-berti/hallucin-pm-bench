7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, penalizing differences in content, structure, accuracy, conciseness, and fidelity to the prompt. The ground truth is highly concise, focusing only on explicit decision points (strictly the conditional skip and TriVote gate) and a plain list of documents without extras. Even minor additions or rephrasings count as deviations under the strictness directive.

#### Part (a): Decision Points (Score impact: -2.0 from perfect 10.0)
- **Strengths (+ alignment):** Correctly identifies the two core decision points from ground truth (risk-based skip and TriVote). The skip rule is accurately summarized in one sentence. The TriVote rule captures the "any two out of three" essence (minor rephrasing from "at least two... record 'Approve'" to "any two... are received" is negligible). Includes the Sustainability Officer note from the process description, which is factual.
- **Weaknesses (- differences):** 
  - Adds an extraneous third decision point (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) as a "gate/conditional branch," describing it as evaluating scorecards and outputting a risk rating. This is incorrect: the process treats Tri-Color as a computational step (not a decision/gate), with the actual branch occurring *after* it (the skip condition). Ground truth correctly starts with the "Risk-based skip *after* Tri-Color," avoiding this error. This is a significant hallucination/inaccurate categorization, introducing an invalid item and bloating the response beyond the ground truth's two points.
  - Structure: Uses a table with headers and numbering, plus an explanatory note ("No further explicit decision gates..."). Ground truth uses a plain numbered list with bolded titles and one-sentence rules, no table or trailing note. This adds unnecessary formatting and commentary, diverging from the concise "one sentence each" requirement.
- **Net:** Core rules are mostly right, but the extra point and structural extras make this ~75% aligned (7.5/10 for this part).

#### Part (b): Documents (Score impact: -0.5 total)
- **Strengths (+ alignment):** The list is complete and in correct first-appearance order, matching ground truth exactly (including treating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct item post-signing). No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML docs). The added note correctly echoes that KYC/AML are absent, aligning with ground truth's anti-hallucination warning.
- **Weaknesses (- differences):**
  - Adds descriptive parentheticals (e.g., "(the loan‑application form)", "(binding offer)"), step references (e.g., "Step 1 – Receive-Application"), and a table format. Ground truth is a stark, unadorned numbered list with just the document names (e.g., "1. Form 14B"). These extras violate the prompt's "list all documents... in the order they first appear" by introducing interpretive fluff and structure not present in ground truth.
  - Minor: Boldens some items inconsistently and separates scorecards properly, but the overall embellishment reduces fidelity.
- **Net:** Factually perfect but structurally verbose; minor deduction for additions (9.5/10 for this part).

#### Overall Score Calculation
- Perfect alignment would be 10.0 (exact match in content, structure, and brevity).
- Deductions: -2.0 for part (a) inaccuracies/extras (primary issue: invalid decision point inclusion); -0.5 for part (b) formatting/descriptive bloat. No other major errors (e.g., no factual hallucinations like inventing docs or rules).
- Final: 7.5. The response is helpful and mostly accurate but deviates enough in categorization and presentation to warrant a clear penalty under strict evaluation—it's not a "copy" of ground truth but an expanded/erroneous version.
