4.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Overall Conclusion**: Both the LLM answer and ground truth correctly conclude "No" (non-compliant), which aligns on the high-level outcome. This provides a baseline but does not offset errors in justification.
- **Rule-by-Rule Comparison** (Strict Assessment):
  - **Rule 1**: LLM correctly identifies it as satisfied (QE once, before RA). Matches ground truth. (+1.0 equivalent)
  - **Rule 2**: LLM incorrectly states VP occurs *before* both QE and RA (violation), but the trace shows VP *after* RA (which is after QE), so it is satisfied per ground truth. This is a major factual error in trace analysis. (-2.5)
  - **Rule 3**: LLM correctly identifies violation (NA before RA completion). Matches ground truth. (+1.5)
  - **Rule 4**: LLM incorrectly states CC occurs *before* NA (violation), but the trace shows CC *after* NA (and VP), so it is satisfied per ground truth. Another major factual error in sequence interpretation. (-2.5)
- **Additional Issues**: LLM's justification misreads the trace order entirely for VP and CC, introducing unnecessary violations and inflating the perceived severity of non-compliance. While it references rules explicitly, the errors are not minor (e.g., basic sequence misreading) and significantly deviate from ground truth accuracy. No credit for structure (e.g., bolding or brevity) as it doesn't correct substantive flaws.
- **Scoring Rationale**: Partial credit for correct conclusion and accurate assessment of the key violating rule (3), but heavy deductions for two critical errors that could mislead on compliance details. Strictness applied: ~50% alignment yields mid-low score.
