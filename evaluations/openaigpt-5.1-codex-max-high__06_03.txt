The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, matching the core content of the ground truth. Minor deductions for: (1) using semicolon ";" instead of "‖" symbol (-0.3); (2) lacking descriptive headers like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**" (-0.3); (3) no backticks around task names (-0.1); (4) omitting the confirmatory sentence "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel" (-0.1). These are small presentational differences but warrant point loss under strict criteria, though the response fully adheres to the user prompt's requirements for conciseness and focus.
