9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
**Strengths (high score basis):**
- **Correctness (perfect, full points):** Top 3 activities correctly identified and ranked by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h). Both avg and 95th-percentile times quoted verbatim from table (e.g., 120.0h preserved precisely, unlike GT's abbreviated "120 h").
- **No unwarranted content (perfect):** Strictly limited to these 3 activities, waiting times only—no service times, throughput, or extras.
- **Format & conciseness (near-perfect):** Crisp memo structure with executive header (To:/Subject: improves "executive memo" fit over GT's bare list); ~110 words (well under 150).
- **Actions (strong but deducted):** All concrete, logically tied to waiting issues, data-driven (cite pilots/priors with ≥20% claims), relevant to insurance context.

**Deductions (-0.8 total, strict per instructions):**
- **Phrasing/structure differences from GT (-0.3):** "1) **Request_Documents** — Avg 36.5h; 95th pct 120.0h" vs. GT's "#1 Request_Documents – avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h" (e.g., "95th pct" vs. "p95"; em-dash vs. en-dash; bolding/header extras not in GT).
- **Action wording variances (-0.5):** Similar intent but not identical (small errors per strictness):
  | Activity | LLM Action | GT Action | Diff Impact |
  |----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
  | #1 | Same-day reminders + self-serve upload; pilots >25% | 24h escalation reminders; pilot ≥25% | Extra "self-serve" element; "same-day" vs. "24h". |
  | #2 | Auto-generate + e-delivery; prior ~30% | Manual batch → same-day e-signature; est 30% | "Prior adoption" vs. "estimated"; omits "batch printing". |
  | #3 | Risk-triage + reallocate peaks; similar >20% | Rules-engine pre-classify bypass; 20-25% | Extra "peak reallocation" (slightly broader); "risk-based" vs. "rules-engine". |

No factual errors or violations, but cumulative phrasing/action diffs warrant deduction under "utmost strictness" and "differences → lower grade." Overall, highly compliant but not a verbatim GT match.
