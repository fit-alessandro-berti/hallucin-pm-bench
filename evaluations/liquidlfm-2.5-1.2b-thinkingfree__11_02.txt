**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Criteria)
- **Identification of three worst-performing activities (Major failure, -4.0 pts):** LLM selects **Check_Coverage** (throughput 270/high, wait 4/low, rework 0.6/low, SLA 1.5/low – not worst), **Approve_Claim** (throughput 182/moderate-low, but rework 0.4/very low, SLA 0.9/low – not worst), **Review_Documents** (correctly bad). Ground truth correctly picks clear worst by multi-metrics: **Request_Documents** (throughput 190/worst, wait 150/worst, rework 22/worst), **Review_Documents**, **Initial_Assessment**. LLM ignores table data (e.g., no "minimal throughput" for Check_Coverage).
- **Explanations why under-performs (Major failure, -2.5 pts):** Vague/inaccurate. "Minimal throughput" for Check_Coverage false; "high rework" for Approve_Claim false (0.4% is low); "inherits variability" for Review_Documents vague, not tied to specifics like 25min processing/12.4% SLA/9 stdev. Ground truth cites exact metrics (e.g., "150 min...22%").
- **One concrete, data-driven action per activity (Total failure, -1.5 pts):** None provided. Vague "Target process optimization...enhance performance" is generic, not data-driven/concrete (e.g., no "automatic digital requests to cut 150min wait/halve 22% rework").
- **Other (minor deductions):** Under 200 words (+0.5 partial), memo format (+0.5 partial), no hallucinations of absent activities (+0). But overall non-compliant with "strictly on the table," "concrete," "data-driven."

**Total: 2.0/10** (Partial structure/1 correct activity, but core task obliterated by factual errors/missing elements. Strictness demands near-zero for such deviations.)
