6.0

The LLM answer exhibits multiple issues in terms of both process mapping rigor and RACI accuracy when compared to the ground truth. Here are the primary reasons for this deduction:

**Major Issues:**  
1. **RACI Assignments:**  
   - The answer uses only “R” and “A”, omitting “C” (Consulted) and “I” (Informed,”) both of which are present and relevant in the ground truth answer.  
   - Several activities are marked only as *Responsible* or *Accountable* for a single role, missing the complexity of dual *R/A* (as in “R/A” for Account Manager in multiple rows in the ground truth) and ignoring *C* and *I* assignments altogether (which are present for nearly every activity in the ground truth).

2. **Strictness on Preferred Vocabulary:**  
   - The answer does correctly use all three mandated preferred terms: “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance”. No forbidden terms appear. This is a positive point.

**Minor Issues:**  
1. **Role Naming:**  
   - The answer uses abbreviations (“AM”, “CO”, etc.) instead of full role names as in the ground truth. While abbreviations are understandable, the prompt implies precision is required—this is a minor but notable deviation since it could hinder clarity.

2. **Matrix Structure:**  
   - The matrix structure is acceptable, but legend notes that consulting roles are not required—contradicting the prompt’s emphasis on being strict to assignment, further showing incomplete application of RACI.

**Summary:**  
- Vocabulary: 10/10 (no errors; all required terms present, no forbidden ones)
- RACI accuracy/detail: Major deductions for omitting “C”/“I”, missing “R/A” dual responsibility/accountability, and simplifying the roles.
- Structure/presentation: Minor deduction for abbreviations instead of full titles.

**Overall:**  
A 6.0 is warranted: the answer is technically compliant on vocabulary but fails to implement the expected RACI rigor, diversity, and detail, which are core to a process mapping consultant’s assignment.
