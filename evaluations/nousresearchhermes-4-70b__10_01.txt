4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Compliance (20% weight)**: Perfect adherence to mandated terms (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance used exactly; no forbidden variants like "Customer Due Diligence," "Order Validation," or "Payment Processing"). No mentions or quotes of forbidden terms. Score: 10/10.
- **Structure and Format (20% weight)**: Basic table structure present with activities as rows and roles as columns, aligning with prompt. However, uses abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full role names (Account Manager, etc.), adds unnecessary numbering to activities, includes a partial legend (only R/A, ignoring C/I), and adds an extraneous note on "consulting roles" (unwarranted content per rubric). Ground truth uses full names, no numbers, full RACI legend implied, and bolding for emphasis (absent here). Significant deductions for incompleteness and extras. Score: 3/10.
- **Completeness of RACI Matrix (30% weight)**: Major failure. RACI requires specifying Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) for *all* cells per role per activity. LLM answer leaves most cells blank (implying no C/I assignments), making it an incomplete RA-only matrix rather than full RACI. No extra tasks/roles/columns introduced (positive), but rubric emphasizes full allocations reflecting the narrative. Ground truth fills every cell. Score: 2/10.
- **Accuracy of Allocations (30% weight)**: Several critical errors and omissions vs. ground truth, violating "each activity has exactly one Responsible" (LLM complies here but misses context) and "Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate":
  - Receive Application: Partial (AM R matches, but misses AM A, CO C, FC/IT I).
  - KYC Review: Incorrect (CO A instead of CO R/AM A; misses FC C, IT I).
  - Order Vetting: Partial (AM A, but should be R/A; misses CO C, FC/IT I).
  - Payment Clearance: Partial (FC R correct, but misses AM A, CO C, IT I).
  - Record Update: Partial (IT R correct, but misses AM/FC C, CO I).
  - Notify Customer: Partial (AM R matches, but should be R/A; misses all I's).
  No bolding for primary responsibilities as in ground truth. Small errors (e.g., R vs. R/A) compound with major ones (wrong roles, omissions), leading to significant loss per strictness rule. Rubric notes self-awareness N/A, but allocations do not fully "reflect the narrative." Score: 2/10.
  
**Overall Rationale**: While terminology is flawless, the response is fundamentally flawed as a RACI matrix due to incompleteness (no C/I), inaccuracies (e.g., KYC Review misassignment), and format deviations. This results in substantial differences from ground truth, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. A complete, accurate match would score 10.0; here, it's ~40% aligned at best.
