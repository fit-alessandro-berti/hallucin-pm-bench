### Evaluation Breakdown
While the LLM answer is well-structured and captures the essence of part (a) with only minor wording and titling deviations (e.g., "skip" vs. "bypasses"; different phrasing for the TriVote rule that still conveys the core logic accurately), part (b) contains significant inaccuracies warranting a major deduction. Specifically:

- **Part (a) (strong match, minor issues):** The two decision points are correctly identified and summarized in one sentence each, closely aligning with the ground truth. Differences are cosmetic (e.g., title phrasing, exact wording like "proceed to that step" vs. "proceeds to that review," and listing roles explicitly vs. parenthetically), but the rules are faithfully represented without omission or addition. No hallucinations. This merits ~9/10.

- **Part (b) (poor match, substantial errors):** The list is incomplete and incorrectly interpreted. The ground truth requires listing **all** documents "required anywhere in the process" (including internal ones), in first-appearance order, treating each distinct item separately:
  - Scorecards are three separate documents (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), not a grouped entry—LLM merges them into one line, disrupting order and count.
  - "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is explicitly mentioned in step 8 as a distinct required document (distinct from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7); LLM omits it entirely.
  - "Loan Dossier 2025" is a required document in step 9; LLM wrongly excludes it based on an overinterpretation of "requested" (the query says "required anywhere," not limited to applicant submissions, and the ground truth includes it).
  - Result: LLM lists only 5 entries (with grouping), vs. ground truth's 9 distinct items. This is a critical omission and misrepresentation, even though the core sequence (Form 14B → scorecards → Deck Memo → Offer Sheet 77 → ID Matrix Declaration) is partially correct. The added note justifying exclusion introduces an unsupported distinction. This merits ~4/10.

Overall score reflects the imbalance: excellent on (a), but (b)'s errors (incompleteness, grouping, and exclusion) violate the strictness criterion, as they alter the factual accuracy and completeness against the ground truth. No policy violations or hallucinations beyond the interpretive error in (b).
