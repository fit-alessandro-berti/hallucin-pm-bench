6.0

**Justification for Scoring:**

**A) Decision Points (a):**
- The LLM answer accurately identifies and summarizes the two main decision points:  
  - The risk-based skip after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check  
  - The TriVote approval gate and its “two out of three” rule.
- The phrasing is clear and essentially correct.  
- Slight inaccuracy: For the TriVote gate, it does not explicitly state that “the loan may advance only when at least two of the three approve,” but it does explain the “at least two out of three approvals required,” which is close and clear enough.

**B) Documents (b):**
- Major errors here:
  - The LLM omits **Signed Offer Sheet 77** and lists only “Offer Sheet 77.” These are not the same; the process clearly requires both the issued and the signed version as separate documents.
  - “Loan Dossier 2025” is described only as an internal compilation, not as a required document, and is not included in the main list.
  - The three scorecards are grouped together as “Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow,” but the expected output lists them as separate items (likely minor, but per prompt, small errors should be penalized).
- Order: The LLM puts “ID Matrix Declaration” after “Offer Sheet 77” in a “confirmation” bundle, which technically matches the process, but missing “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is a key oversight.
- The Deck Memo is listed as being “created only if triggered.” This is correct but not a flaw, as the ground truth includes Deck Memo regardless.
- The note disqualifying Loan Dossier 2025 as a required document is incorrect; the ground truth expects it in the list.

**Other:**
- The LLM answer does NOT hallucinate extra documents (as forbidden by the note).
- Extra commentary (“let me know if you need…”), while not penalizable, is unnecessary.

**Strictness Adhered:**
- The main differences are the omission of “Signed Offer Sheet 77” and “Loan Dossier 2025” from the required documents list, and the grouping rather than enumeration of the scorecards.

**Summary:**  
Decision points are handled well, but errors in document enumeration/order/omission are significant per your requirement for strict grading and point-loss for small errors. Hence, **6.0** is a fair, strictly-applied score.
