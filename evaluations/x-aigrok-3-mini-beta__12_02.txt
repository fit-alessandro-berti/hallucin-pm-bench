The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a concise, accurate justification in one paragraph, citing the exact same counter-examples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11) as the ground truth. It precisely explains the violations (Validate_Payment before Receive_Order in C003 and absence of Receive_Order in C005), mirroring the ground truth's logic and emphasis on "not always." Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing in C005 ("without any preceding Receive_Order in the log" vs. ground truth's "never contains *Receive_Order* at all," which better ties to per-case scope) and lack of bullet formatting or bold emphasis, but these are cosmetic and do not alter the factual accuracy or completeness.
