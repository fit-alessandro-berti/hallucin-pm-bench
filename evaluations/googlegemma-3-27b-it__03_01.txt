The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, naming, conditions, and XML details, despite capturing the core process logic. Key differences include: missing `<?xml>` declaration; incorrect namespace (no `targetNamespace`, uses `id` instead); process attributes mismatch (id, name, `isExecutable`); start event lacks name "Ticket Submitted" and uses "t1" vs. "start"; classification task named "Classify Ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification"; gateways gw1 and gw2 lack names ("Password Reset?" and "Resolved Internally?"); no third exclusive gateway (gw3) for the confirmation decision, instead using invalid/non-standard conditional flows directly from the confirm task; condition expressions use non-conforming `${}` scripts without `xsi:type="tFormalExpression"` or simple "yes"/"no"; no `sequenceFlow` id attributes (e.g., "f1"); task and event IDs inconsistent (e.g., resolve as "t5" vs. "t4", end as "t8" unnamed vs. "end" named "Ticket Closed"); and the loop targets different IDs though same element. These accumulate to numerous small and major errors, violating strict fidelity to the ground truth XML.
