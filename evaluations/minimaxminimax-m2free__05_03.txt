3.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Compliance (Major Deduction: -5.0)**: The LLM answer incorrectly places the boundary timer on "Activity_VerifyID" (starting the clock during identity verification), which enforces a deadline on the wrong task and fails to measure the required 48-hour window *from finishing Verify Identity to completing Create Account*. The ground truth correctly attaches it to "Activity_CreateAccount" to time the post-verification phase accurately. This is a fundamental logical error misaligning with the SLA, warranting severe penalty under strict criteria.
- **XML Structure and Additions (-1.0)**: The LLM redeclares the entire `<bpmn:userTask id="Activity_VerifyID">` element (unnecessary repetition, violating "changed or added XML elements only") and omits `cancelActivity="true"` for explicit interrupting behavior (ground truth includes it for clarity and precision). The sequence flow addition is mostly correct in concept but tied to the wrong timer, and it adds an extraneous `name="Escalate to AM"` attribute not in the ground truth.
- **Justification (-0.5)**: One sentence as required, but factually incorrect (references timer on Verify Identity instead of Create Account), directly contradicting the ground truth's accurate explanation.
- **Positives (Partial Credit: +3.5 base +1.0 for intent)**: Uses correct BPMN syntax for timer (`PT48H`), leverages the existing "Activity_AMReview" without adding new activities (aligns with task constraints), and attempts a boundary event escalation path. Format is concise and XML-focused.
