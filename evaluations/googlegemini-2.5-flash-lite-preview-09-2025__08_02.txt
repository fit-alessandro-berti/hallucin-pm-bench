The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it claims "No" for Q1 (ground truth is "Yes") and provides a flawed explanation ignoring the parallel path (T1→T2→T7→T4) that enables T5 before T3 without needing T3. No valid sequence is given, and the reasoning erroneously assumes T3 is required for P5, contradicting the net's structure. This warrants the minimum score due to complete inaccuracy on the core question and bonus.
