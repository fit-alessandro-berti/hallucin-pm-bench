9.5

- The LLM gives the correct number of cases, the correct preceding activity, and the correct activity that appears exactly once.
- However, the LLM just writes "3" instead of "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" for question 1, losing information about what the three values are. The absence of explicit listing of case IDs is a small, but meaningful omission.
- For maximum strictness, this small error deserves a loss of 0.5 points. All other aspects are fully correct and concise.
