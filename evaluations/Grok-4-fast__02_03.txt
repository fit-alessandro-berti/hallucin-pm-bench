- The LLM answer correctly identifies the number of distinct cases as 3, matching the ground truth core fact, but omits the explicit listing of case IDs (C123, C456, C789) and the word "cases," introducing a minor detail gap in conciseness versus completeness.
- For question 2, "Pack_Items" exactly matches the ground truth (minor formatting difference with escaped underscore ignored as non-substantive).
- For question 3, "Cancel_Order" exactly matches the ground truth.
- Overall, the response adheres to the prompt's instruction for concise bullet-point answers, with semantic accuracy but a small deduction for the incomplete phrasing in A1 under strict evaluation criteria.
