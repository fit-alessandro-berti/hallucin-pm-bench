The LLM answer is correct in stating that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the lack of timestamp data, which is the core requirement of the prompt. However, it is less explicit than the ground truth in specifying that it is the *interval between “start” and “complete”* events that is missing and that only event counts are provided. The answer could be improved by more clearly mentioning that only occurrences (counts), not timings, are available, and thus start-to-completion intervals are absent. This omission, while minor, warrants a full point deduction for utmost strictness.
