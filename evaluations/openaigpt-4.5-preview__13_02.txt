The LLM answer is accurate and complete for questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth exactly on counts and percentages (including calculations and rounding). For question 3, the response stays under 100 words (89 words) and addresses generalization risks, but it only implicitly references the single occurrence (via "rarely" and "scarce" rather than explicitly noting "only once" as required), and it discusses distortion/skewing without directly mentioning variance, instability, noise, or confidence intervals. This lacks the precision of the ground truth criteria, warranting a deduction despite overall relevance.
