9.0

- The LLM's answer is very close to the ground truth, matching all substantive content and giving concise, bulleted responses as requested.
- Minor points are deducted for formatting differences:
    - The LLM restates the question in the second and third bullets rather than using the minimal format shown in the ground truth (A2: Pack_Items, A3: Cancel_Order).
    - Quotes/italics in listing the activity names differ slightly from the ground truth.
- There are no factual, logical, or ordering errors.
- According to "utmost strictness" and that even small formatting/presentation issues should reduce score, 1 point is deducted.
