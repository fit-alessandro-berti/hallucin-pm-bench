The LLM answer is accurate for questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth exactly on counts and percentages (including rounding to two decimals). For question 3, the explanation is concise (under 100 words), addresses low support's risks (e.g., distortion of metrics like cycle time, skewing assessments), notes instability in small samples, and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., misleading fraud inferences). However, it deducts a point under strict evaluation for not explicitly mentioning the "single-occurrence" issue in the rationale (using percentages for "low support" instead), as required by ground truth criteria, though wording otherwise varies acceptably.
