**9.5**

- **1.** Correct: Manual_Fraud_Check occurs **once**.  
- **2a.** Correct: (1/48)*100 = **2.08%**.  
- **2b.** Correct: (1/12)*100 = **8.33%**.  
- **3.** The explanation identifies that the activity has low support, mentions possible distortion to metrics (cycle time, fraud patterns), susceptibility to outlier influence in small samples, and risk of overgeneralisation. It urges caution and sampling/robustness. However, it does not explicitly mention statistical "variance" or "instability" by name, and does not use the precise language "single occurrence"/"rests on a single observation". These are expected per the rubric, so a minor deduction applies.  

**Strictly, this is nearly perfect, but for ultimate rigor and to reflect the missing direct mention of variance/single-occurrence instability, the score is 9.5.**
