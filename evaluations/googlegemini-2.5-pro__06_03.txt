The LLM answer provides both sets of concurrently executable tasks, enumerates them in order of appearance, and lists the task names correctly, matching the ground truth in content and sequence. However, minor formatting differences exist:

- The ground truth explicitly labels each set by parallel block (e.g., "**Set 1 â€“ first parallel block:**"), whereas the LLM answer only numbers the sets.
- The ground truth uses code formatting and a slightly more formal structure.
- The LLM answer omits the final sentence from the ground truth stating, "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel."

Although none of these affect the correctness of the task sets, they reflect small deviations from the specificity and completeness of the ground truth. Thus, a 1-point deduction is appropriate for these minor omissions and differences.
