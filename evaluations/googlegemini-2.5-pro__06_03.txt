The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two concurrent task sets from Process B in the proper order, focusing solely on the required content without referencing Processes A or C. The core tasks match exactly. Minor deductions for: (1) lack of descriptive labels (e.g., "first parallel block"), (2) absence of parallel notation (â€–) and formatting (backticks, bold), (3) plain indentation instead of structured listing, (4) unnecessary introductory phrase, and (5) omission of the closing statement affirming no other parallels. These are small presentational differences but warrant a slight loss under strict evaluation criteria.
