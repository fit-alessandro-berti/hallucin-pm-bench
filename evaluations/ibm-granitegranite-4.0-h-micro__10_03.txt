1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Activities**: The LLM adds unauthorized activities (e.g., "Escalation Decision", "Treasury Ops Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification to Analyst"), splits others (e.g., separating scheduling from release), and omits or merges inconsistently, violating the prompt's rule against renaming, merging, or adding activities. The ground truth strictly limits to six activities derived from the narrative without extras.
- **Format and Notation**: Uses full phrases (e.g., "Responsible", "Consulted") instead of RACI abbreviations (R, A, C, I, –). Lacks bolding for activity names and role assignments as in the ground truth. Employs empty cells instead of "–" for no involvement, leading to incomplete representation.
- **RACI Assignments**: Numerous mismatches, e.g.:
  - Intake Vetting: LLM assigns only Front-Office as Responsible and Compliance as Consulted; ground truth has Front-Office as R,A, Compliance as C, Treasury as I, Officer as –.
  - KYC Review: LLM assigns only Compliance as Responsible; ground truth has Compliance as R,A, Officer as C, Treasury as I, Front-Office as –.
  - AML Screening: LLM incorrectly assigns Compliance as Consulted and Officer as Responsible; ground truth has Compliance as R,A, Officer as C, others I or –.
  - Risk Scoring: LLM assigns Treasury as Responsible (incorrect); ground truth has Compliance as R, Officer as A, Front-Office as C, Treasury as I.
  - Additional rows in LLM (e.g., Escalation Decision, Notification) have no ground truth equivalents, introducing errors.
- **Vocabulary**: While the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) are used correctly without synonyms, this minor adherence cannot offset the pervasive violations elsewhere.
- **Completeness**: Fails to cover "every activity and role" accurately without additions, and roles are not fully populated (e.g., missing Informed roles where ground truth specifies them).

These errors—ranging from structural to content-specific—represent fundamental non-compliance, with no partial credit for isolated correct elements under utmost strictness.
