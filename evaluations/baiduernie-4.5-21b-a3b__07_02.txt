**Score: 5.0**

**Evaluation:**

- **Added tasks:**  
  The LLM answer lists all three newly added tasks and is correct here.

- **Removed tasks:**  
  The LLM answer states "None," which is incorrect. The task "Reject Loan" (`Task_RejectLoan`) from BPMN_v1 does not exist in BPMN_v2 and is explicitly listed in the ground truth as a removed task. This is a critical omission.

- **Gateway-type changes:**  
  The LLM correctly identifies the gateway change from ExclusiveGateway to InclusiveGateway, matching the ground truth.

**Summary of errors and penalties:**

- The answer misses the one removed task, which is a major error under requested strictness, warranting a severe point reduction (often 3-5 points, as the overall set of changes is not large).
- The format is otherwise concise and accurate for the other two headings, but the lack of explanation/clarity or missed mapping of gateway description does not call for further deduction, since headings/content are covered.

**Strict assessment reasoning:**  
Given three categories with four required key items (3 added, 1 removed, 1 gateway change), omitting an entire category’s only entry means 1/4 major required facts is missing. Under a strict rubric, this translates to a maximum in the 4–6 range. Therefore, **5.0** reflects the answer's adequacy for the correct categories and the significance of its critical omission.
