### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit):** The LLM correctly identifies the three added tasks by their IDs (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), aligning with the ground truth's additions. The gateway-type change is mostly accurate, noting the shift from ExclusiveGateway to InclusiveGateway for the same ID (Gateway_Decision), though it lacks the ground truth's precise terminology (e.g., "exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)").
- **Major Errors (significant deductions):** 
  - **Removed tasks:** Completely incorrectâ€”claims "None," but the ground truth explicitly identifies "Reject Loan" (Task_RejectLoan) as removed. This omits a core change, violating the prompt's requirement to summarize *all* changes strictly under the headings. This alone warrants a severe penalty under strict evaluation.
  - **Format and completeness issues:** Added tasks list only IDs without names (e.g., ground truth includes "Verify Identity" with ID in parentheses), reducing clarity and fidelity. No explicit note that no other changes exist, as in the ground truth. Headings use inconsistent formatting (e.g., bold vs. italicized/numbered lists), and the response ignores the prompt's "exactly these headings" structure by not matching the bullet-point style precisely.
- **Overall Strictness:** With utmost strictness, the critical failure on removed tasks (a full category error) and minor formatting/name omissions result in a low score. No criminal or jailbreak issues apply here.
