**10.0**

The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth in all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable), overall result (**NON-COMPLIANT**), factual accuracy, and justification essence. Minor wording variations (e.g., R2 phrasing sequence vs. dates; R4 "control not triggered" vs. "trace has") are semantic equivalents, all ≤20 words, with no errors under strict evaluation. Format adheres to prompt (list vs. ground truth table irrelevant as prompt specifies no table).
