The LLM answer violates core rules by proposing multiple (three) attribute changes instead of exactly one improvement, uses an invalid and non-unified diff format (no proper hunk with @@, -/+, or context lines), targets incorrect tasks (Prepare Contract, Sign Contract, and Grant Access instead of Collect Equipment), employs inconsistent duration formats ("PT24H" vs. original "PD" and ground truth "P2D"), and provides a rationale that mismatches its own diff while ignoring the implied 3-day SLA context, resulting in zero alignment with the ground truth.
