### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes in content: the three added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), the one removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change from exclusive to inclusive (Gateway_Decision). It adheres to the required headings and ignores irrelevant aspects like name changes (e.g., "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan") or flow updates, matching the ground truth's core substance.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting inconsistencies** (significant deduction): Uses bullet points with "id (name: 'name')" structure instead of the ground truth's numbered lists, bolded names, and backticked IDs (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"). Headings use "###" Markdown instead of "* **Heading**". This deviates from the expected precise structure, warranting a -1.0 point loss.
- **Gateway description incompleteness** (moderate deduction): States the tag change with ID but omits explanatory details like "from **exclusive** (XOR) in *v1* to **inclusive** (OR) in *v2*", reducing precision and educational value. -0.5 point loss.
- **Missing elements** (minor deduction): Lacks the ground truth's introductory "## **Expected Answer Key**" and closing note ("*(No other...)*"), which frame the response but are not strictly required by the prompt. -0.0 further, as they are supplementary.

Overall, the response is highly accurate (95%+ content match) but loses points for stylistic and descriptive mismatches against the ground truth. No major errors like hallucinated changes.
