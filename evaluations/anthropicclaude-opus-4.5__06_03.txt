The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt and ground truth. It focuses solely on Process B as required, numbers the sets clearly (as "Set 1" and "Set 2"), and associates them explicitly with the parallel splits (#1 and #2) from the process description.

Minor deductions for:
- Different formatting (## headers, bullets, and bolding vs. numbered list with `backticks` and ‖ symbol): -0.5
- Extra accurate but unrequested explanatory sentences about preceding tasks: -0.5
- Lacks the ground truth's closing "No other tasks..." sentence (though implied by completeness and not prompted): -0.0 (no deduction, as not required)

Semantically and factually identical; stylistic differences only under utmost strictness.
