The LLM answer is highly similar in content and conciseness, correctly identifying the lack of timestamps and durations as the core issue, but it loses points for minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute the average cycle time"; omits explicit reference to "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals"; slight rephrasing of "durations" vs. "duration information"). Under strict evaluation, these small deviations warrant a deduction despite overall accuracy.
