The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core content, correctly stating that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to missing timestamps/elapsed-time data, and providing a clear explanation tied to the need for temporal information. It adheres to the system prompt's guidance on deriving values from data. Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., "not available" vs. "cannot be computed"; omission of explicit mention of "ordering information" or "fabricated" answers) and less precise enumeration of present data fields (case-id, activity, resource), which introduce subtle imprecisions under strict evaluation.
