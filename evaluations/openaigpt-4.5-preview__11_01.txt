8.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in identifying and ranking the three worst activities strictly by waiting time, with correctly quoted average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each. It avoids discussing service-time, throughput, or irrelevant activities, in line with requirements.

Point deductions:

- **Concrete Actions**: The actions are generally reasonable but are less specific and somewhat less concrete/data-driven than those in the ground truth. For example, the reminder system for "Request Documents" lacks mention of escalation triggers and testing evidence. The "Send Closure Letter" recommendation proposes automation but omits the precise change from batch printing to e-signature, and does not quantify the estimated reduction. The "Assess Liability" solution suggests a prioritization dashboard but does not propose direct queue bypass for simple cases, as in the ground truth.
- **Quoting / Precision**: While the numbers are directly quoted from the table (good), some quoted values use abbreviations ("95th perc." rather than "p95"), which, while not a major error, slightly reduces precision relative to the ground truth format.
- **Word count**: The response fits the length requirement.

Overall, the submission meets the core requirements but scores lower due to lack of specificity and concreteness in the recommended actions compared to the ground truth, as well as minor deviations in quoting format.
