**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Missing activities (major failure, -4.0 points)**: LLM only includes 4 activities; ground truth has 6 ("Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" are explicitly derived from the narrative's escalation, scheduling, approval, release, and notification steps). Prompt requires covering **every activity** described; LLM omits 2 entire rows (33% of GT content).
- **RACI assignment errors across all 4 shared rows (major, -2.5 points)**:
  | Activity | Errors |
  |----------|--------|
  | Intake Vetting | Officer: I vs – |
  | KYC Review | Front-Office: C vs –; Officer: I vs C (2 errors) |
  | AML Screening | Front-Office: C vs –; Officer: I vs C (2 errors) |
  | Risk Scoring | Front-Office: I vs C; Treasury Ops: C vs I (2 errors) |
  - Total: 7 cell-level mismatches (out of 16 shared cells; ~44% inaccurate).
- **Formatting deviations (-0.5 points)**: No bolding on activities/R,A; uses en-dash in header; no dashes (–) for no involvement; minor header spacing diffs.
- **Strengths (partial credit, baseline +1.0)**: Perfect vocabulary compliance (exact mandated terms, no leaks/synonyms); valid Markdown table; covers core 4 activities without merging/renaming.
- **Net**: Severe structural/content gaps outweigh basics; 2.0 reflects ~20% alignment under utmost strictness.
