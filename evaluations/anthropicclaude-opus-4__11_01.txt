7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes the required metrics verbatim, stays under 150 words, and avoids prohibited content. The formal memo structure aligns with "crisp executive memo" intent.

However, significant deductions for differences from ground truth: actions differ entirely (e.g., LLM proposes automation/AI without evidential ties, vs. ground truth's pilot-tested/escalation-based remedies), lacking explicit "data-driven" support like "pilot tests show" or "estimated." Expected reductions (>40%, etc.) feel unsubstantiated claims rather than data-referenced. Minor extras (e.g., closing sentence on efficiency) add unwarranted fluff, violating strict conciseness. These reduce relevance and fidelity by ~25%, per utmost strictness.
