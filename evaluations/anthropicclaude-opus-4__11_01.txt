7.0

The LLM answer largely matches the ground truth in identifying and ranking the three worst activities strictly by waiting time, and accurately quotes both average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each. The recommendations are reasonable, relevant, and plausibly data-driven for reducing waiting times.

However, several issues warrant a significant deduction:

- **Wording/Quoting:** The waiting time figures are not expressed strictly "verbatim" as requested, especially missing the spacing/formatting (omitting "h" [hours] in the summary lines), which the prompt demands. (Minor, but per strictness, should cost points!)
- **Inflated Claims:** The reductions promised (>40%, >70%, >30%) are unsubstantiated, unlike the pilot/data references in the ground truth (which never exceed 30%). This invents estimates that are not evidenced in the data.
- **Unwarranted Content/Tone:** There is some excess: a cover memo/formal header, generic claims about customer experience/efficiency in the last sentenceâ€”both considered surplus to the strict memo requirements and not supported by the snapshot or instructions.
- **Speculation:** The proposed use of "AI-assisted liability assessment" and automation generally overreaches the specific, measured approaches in the ground truth (e.g., rules-engine pre-classification, reminders with escalation triggers).

Overall, the answer is competent in core content but loses significant points due to: lack of verbatim figures, unsupported reduction percentages, non-minimalist surplus language, and too-ambitious remedies relative to provided data.
