### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction)**: LLM uses task rows with R/A/C/I as separate columns (roles filled per category). Ground Truth (GT) uses task rows with roles as columns (R/A/C/I letters in cells). This is a fundamental format mismatch, violating exact replication.
- **Role Set Mismatch (Major Deduction)**: LLM *only* uses mandated roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison), ignoring GT's full set (adds Operations Manager, IT Support). No Operations Manager or IT Support appears in LLM, critical omission.
- **Task Coverage & Naming (Major Deduction)**: LLM expands to 8 tasks (splits source step 5 into "Release" + "Send SWIFT"; adds "Archive" + "Notify" as 7-8). GT strictly has 6 tasks, no splits/extras. Names differ (e.g., LLM "Receive transfer instruction & log it in the system" vs. GT "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM adds "of sender and beneficiary" to KYC; extras like "Notify Regulatory Liaison of completion" invented).
- **RACI Assignments (Complete Mismatch, Major Deduction)**: Zero rows have identical assignments:
  | Task (GT order) | LLM Assignments | GT Assignments | Match? |
  |-----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
  | 1. Receive     | TA R/A; RL I   | TA **R**; RL I; OM **A**; ITS C | Partial (ignores OM/ITS) |
  | 2. Screen      | TA R/A; RL C   | TA **R**; RL **A**; OM I; ITS C | No (RL C vs **A**) |
  | 3. KYC         | RL R/A; TA C   | TA C; RL **R**; OM **A**; ITS I | Partial (ignores OM/ITS) |
  | 4. Approve     | RL R/A; TA C   | TA C; RL **R**; OM **A**; ITS I | Partial (ignores OM/ITS) |
  | 5. Release     | TA R/A; RL C   | TA **R**; RL I; OM **A**; ITS C | No (RL C vs I) |
  | 6. Archive     | TA R/A; RL I (row 7) | TA C; RL I; OM **A**; ITS **R** | No |
  - Extras (rows 6,8 in LLM: Send SWIFT, Notify) have no GT equivalent.
- **Additional Elements (Minor but Cumulative Deduction)**: LLM adds unrequested title, numbering (#), footnote (*All role names...*). GT has precise header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), bolded **KYC Review**, "Legend" footer. No matches.
- **Vocabulary (Partial Credit, Negligible)**: LLM correctly uses mandated terms (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst). GT does too (but adds non-mandated roles). Insufficient to offset above.
- **Overall**: Near-total divergence in core content (assignments, roles, tasks, format). Under utmost strictness, even partial matches fail due to omissions/inventions; score reflects minimal alignment.
