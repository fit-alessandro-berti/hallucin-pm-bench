7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities strictly by waiting time, and quotes both the average and 95th-percentile waiting time for each, matching the table exactly. It does not mention any additional activities or unrelated metrics like service time or throughput.

However, some issues reduce the score:

* Actions are not always as strictly aligned with the data or as conservative as the ground truth. For example:
    - For "Request_Documents", immediate triggering plus 12-hour reminders is reasonable, but claims "≥30%" reduction and cites benchmarks, which is not in the ground truth and ventures a bit beyond the conservative action and results specified.
    - For "Send_Closure_Letter", the action to move to real-time auto-dispatch is similar to the ground truth's e-signature approach, but includes a reference to queue simulation with a specific forecast (25%), which is not directly evidenced and differs from the 30% estimate in the ground truth.
    - For "Assess_Liability", reassigning FTEs and citing capacity modeling reduces wait to 5.8 h (–26%), while the ground truth proposes rules-engine pre-classification and targets a 20–25% decrease—this is a divergence in action and makes somewhat larger presumptions about possible process changes and data use.
* The memo is somewhat more elaborate than the crisp, highly factual style of the ground truth. There's some "selling" language and references to simulation or benchmarks not in the ground truth.
* There is some minor but present extrapolation (e.g., "releasing capital within the current quarter"), which slightly stretches the requirement to be ultra strict and focused only on what is specified.

In summary: All requirements are met at a structural level, but small differences in recommended actions, extrapolated improvement estimates, and extra rationale/phrasing lead to a significant deduction. Strict adherence to the instructions and conservatism in citing actions/effects are not fully maintained.
