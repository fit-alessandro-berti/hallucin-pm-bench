7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high marks for core correctness)**: The LLM answer accurately identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability), quoting the exact figures from the table (e.g., 36.5 h and 120 h for #1). It formats as a proper executive memo under 150 words (~140), omits service times and unlisted activities, and provides one concrete, relevant action per activity with a data-driven ≥20% reduction claim (e.g., "≥30 %," "≥25 %," "-26 %").
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences and strictness)**: Actions differ substantially from ground truth (e.g., LLM's SMS reminders and FTE reassignment vs. ground truth's escalation triggers and rules-engine; no exact matches). Introduces unwarranted elements: mentions another table activity (Initial_Screening), uses throughput figures (255/310 executions), and invents specific unsupported data (e.g., "5.8 h" projection). Format adds extras (subject, closing) absent in ground truth's bullet style. These are small but multiple errors, per strict criteria, costing ~2.5 points total. Overall similarity ~75%.
