10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match in factual content, calculations, and reasoning to the ground truth, with only negligible phrasing variations (e.g., "1 time" vs. "`1` occurrence"; "the case identifier ... is A1002" vs. "Only case A1002 contains"; "%" spacing; explanation depth in Q4 matches allowed concepts stated "clearly"). No hallucinations, inferences beyond log data, or errors under strict evaluation.
