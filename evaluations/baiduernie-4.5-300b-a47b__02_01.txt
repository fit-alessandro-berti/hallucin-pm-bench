7.0

The LLM answer is correct for Q1-Q4, matching the ground truth exactly. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an extra and factually wrong item in the list. This is a significant error in analysis of the log fragment, warranting a deduction despite the partial overlap in the list (3/4 items correct). Under strict evaluation, this reduces the overall score substantially from a perfect 10.0.
