8.0

The LLM answer is correct for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, but makes a single (though substantial according to the instructions) error in Q5: it includes "Quality_Check" as an activity that never appears first, even though case C-77's first (and only) event is "Quality_Check". This is a clear, direct reading error.

Given instructions for utmost strictness and "small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," this error suggests an automatic penalty of at least 2 points, but since all other answers are perfect, the answer should not receive less than 8.0. It loses two points for the error in Q5.
