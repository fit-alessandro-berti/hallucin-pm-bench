**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate, concise, and strictly evidence-based, matching the ground truth in verdict, structure of justification (per-case analysis citing case IDs, activities, and sequences), and key logical points (reversal in Cases 1001/1003; absence in 1002 disproves "always"; no instances of claimed order). It correctly emphasizes "immediately before" without errors, additions, or omissions, exceeding "short justification" requirements while remaining data-bound. No differences warrant deduction under strict evaluation.
