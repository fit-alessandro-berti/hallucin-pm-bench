The LLM answer is an excellent match to the ground truth, with precise responses to questions 1-3 and valid, clearly stated sampling-related reasons for question 4 that directly align with two of the specified options (temporal bias and small sample size, including references to high variance/uncertainty). Minor phrasing variations (e.g., formatting in Q2, brevity in Q3) do not constitute errors, as they preserve accuracy and adhere to the prompt's requirements without inference beyond the log.
