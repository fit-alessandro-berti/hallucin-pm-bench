9.0

- All three answers (A1, A2, A3) are factually correct and match the ground truth.
- The only small deviation is that the LLM answer could be slightly more concise/consistent in formatting (for example, “For Question 1:” etc., vs just listing the bullet points as in the expected answer). Strictly speaking, this is a stylistic difference and not an outright error, but since utmost strictness is required, 1 point is subtracted for this minor inconsistency.
- There are no factual or significant formatting errors.
