The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false with "No" and provides a single-paragraph justification citing the exact same key counterexamples (C003 with lines 6-7 showing Validate_Payment before Receive_Order, and C005 with line 11 showing Validate_Payment without any Receive_Order). It adheres to the prompt's structure and includes accurate line references, including the optional but correct mention of line 12 for completeness in C005. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "the fact is inaccurate" vs. "the claim is false"; added concluding sentence on variability, which is true but not in the ground truth) and less structured formatting (paragraph vs. bulleted list), reflecting small deviations under strict evaluation.
