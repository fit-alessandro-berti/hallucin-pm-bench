7.5

ADDED TASKS:  
- The LLM answer omits the dash "-" at the start of each line, which is explicitly present in the ground truth.  
- The format is otherwise correct, with each task shown as id (name).

REMOVED TASKS:  
- Same issue: missing leading dash.

GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES:  
- The LLM answer omits the leading dashes and also compresses spacing, e.g. "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs "- Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" (note both dashes and spacing; spacing after colon is less relevant, but the missing dash is significant).

- The order and concrete differences reported are correct.

- No extra commentary is added, as per instructions.

Therefore, the answer is strictly functionally correct but loses significant points for not following exact formatting requirements (leading dash per item, as present in the ground truth). This is a significant deviation under strict grading, despite content correctness. Thus, 7.5.
