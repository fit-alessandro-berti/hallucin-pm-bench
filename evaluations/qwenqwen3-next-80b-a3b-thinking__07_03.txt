The LLM answer correctly identifies all verifiable functional changes: three added tasks, one removed task, and two gateway type changes, with exact IDs, names, and type transitions matching the ground truth. Headings are verbatim and in the required order, with no extraneous commentary or unchanged elements mentioned. The only differences are minor formatting omissions—lacking the bullet points/dashes ("-") present in the ground truth for each list item (affecting six lines total) and no alignment spacing in the second gateway entry—which constitute small presentational errors under strict evaluation, warranting a deduction despite perfect content accuracy.
