**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Decision Points (major partial match, -2.5 points)**: LLM identifies 3 decision points, aligning broadly with ground truth's 3 (eligibility in triage, amount threshold, approval). However, it lacks precise branching logic/outcomes (e.g., no "*Eligible* → continue; *Not eligible* → rejected"; no explicit "*Final payment approval*" with "*Approved* → payment; *Rejected* → ends"; no positioning "*after Finance_Controller_PreApprove*" for threshold). Frames activities as decisions without full summary of logic, miscategorizes "High-Value Branch" without exact match to ground truth table structure/logic.
- **Required Documents (significant error, -1.5 points)**: Lists 6/7 correctly (notes conditional for *AuditTrail*), but **misses *RefundConfirmationPDF*** (explicitly defined in step 6 as emailed output, included in ground truth as part of catalogue). Minor typo "*Process.Refund_Payment*".
- **Overall Fidelity/Strictness (-0.5 points)**: Adheres to "no additional activities/artefacts" correctly. Structure is list-based (not table), but prompt doesn't mandate format. No introductions of undefined elements. Small phrasing gaps (e.g., no rejection paths) compound to incomplete summary.
- **Base 10.0 → Total Deduction: -4.0** for differences in completeness, precision, and one outright omission.
