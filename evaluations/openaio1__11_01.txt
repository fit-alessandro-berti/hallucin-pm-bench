8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h/120.0h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), matching the table and ground truth verbatim for numbers (minor unit formatting like "36.5h" vs. "36.5 h" is negligible). It stays under 150 words (~90), omits all non-waiting metrics/activities, and provides one concrete action per activity promising ≥20% waiting-time reduction.

However, strict deductions apply for differences from ground truth:
- **Action specificity and data-driven quality (major difference, -1.0)**: Actions are logically tied to waiting times but less "data-driven" than ground truth's (e.g., no pilots, estimates, or metrics like "≥25% cut" or "30% reduction"); they rely on general claims without the evidential phrasing.
- **Phrasing in #3 action (small error, -0.5)**: "Cutting manual review time" risks implying service-time discussion (banned by prompt), unlike ground truth's clear queue-focused "bypass senior adjuster queue."
- **Format and extras (minor, -0.0)**: Polished memo structure with conclusion adds value but deviates from ground truth's stark list format; no point loss as it fits "crisp executive memo."

Overall, high correctness (95% alignment) but penalized for action variances under utmost strictness.
