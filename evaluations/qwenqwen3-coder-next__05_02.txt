6.2

### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Diff (major partial credit, but deductions for format and value)**: Correctly identifies the exact same element (`Task_CollectEquipment` `camunda:dueDate`) and line structure as ground truth; single hunk with proper unified diff syntax (superior to ground truth's malformed/minimal @@). However, changes to `P1D` instead of `P2D` (-1.5 pts), adds unnecessary file headers (`--- a/process.bpmn`) and line numbers/context not matching ground truth's ultra-minimal style (-0.8 pts). Score: 7.7/10.
- **Rationale (low credit)**: Similar structure (reduce Collect Equipment dueDate from 5 to X days for SLA), identifies sequential bottleneck correctly, but wrong target value (P1D/P8D total vs P2D), fabricates "realistic SLA" and additive logic instead of ground truth's "contractual 3-day SLA" (inaccurate match even if ground truth's math is questionable), slightly over one sentence. Score: 4.0/10.
- **Overall compliance**: Perfectly follows rules (one attribute mod, no add/delete, format labels), right task for SLA fix. Strict deductions for non-exact match per instructions. Weighted average (diff 60%, rationale 30%, compliance 10%): 6.2.
