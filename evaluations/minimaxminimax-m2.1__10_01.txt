**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology (perfect, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Matches ground truth and policy.
- **Structure**: Basic table format present with correct 6 activities as rows and 4 roles as columns (+0.5 partial). However, uses inconsistent formatting (e.g., "R, A" vs. ground truth "**R / A**"; "–" blanks vs. explicit "C"/"I"; full role labels with abbreviations vs. concise names; centered columns unnecessary).
- **RACI Content (major failures, -net 0.5)**: 
  | Activity | Key Mismatches (per cell vs. ground truth) |
  |----------|--------------------------------------------|
  | Receive Application | AM correct (R/A); CO missing **C**; FC/IT missing **I** (3/4 wrong) |
  | KYC Review | AM **I** ≠ **A**; CO **R, A** ≠ **R** (extra A); FC missing **C**; IT missing **I** (4/4 wrong) |
  | Order Vetting | AM correct (R/A); CO correct (**C**); FC/IT missing **I** (2/4 wrong) |
  | Payment Clearance | AM **I** ≠ **A**; CO missing **C**; FC **R, A** ≠ **R** (extra A); IT missing **I** (4/4 wrong) |
  | Record Update | AM correct (**C**); CO **–** ≠ **I**; FC correct (**C**); IT **R, A** ≠ **R** (extra A) (2/4 wrong) |
  | Notify Customer | AM correct (R/A); CO/FC/IT missing **I** (3/4 wrong) |
  - **~70% cells mismatch** (17/24 wrong or partial). Rs align with handlers/narrative, but As misplaced/duplicated; all C/I systematically omitted or wrong. Violates "each activity has exactly one *Responsible*" inference (ok) but fails "AM *Accountable* where appropriate" (e.g., KYC/Payment).
- **Unwarranted Content (penalty)**: Adds RACI Key table (+explanation), Summary section (inaccurate/inconsistent, e.g., claims CO "informed of application receipts" despite matrix blank; FC "informed of vetted orders" despite no I). Introduces fluff contradicting "no extra tasks, roles, or columns."
- **Overall**: Fundamentally diverges from ground truth matrix (minimalist vs. detailed C/I). Extra content worsens. Strict rubric demands near-exact match; small errors (e.g., extra As, missing I/C) compound to major loss. No self-awareness needed.
