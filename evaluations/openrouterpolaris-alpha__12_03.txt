The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, structure (case-by-case analysis), and conclusion, with no errors, omissions, or deviations. Minor differences in formatting (list vs. table) and phrasing (e.g., including extraneous next activities) do not impact accuracy or completeness, as they align fully with the prompt's requirements for justification via CaseIDs and sequences.
