The LLM answer is an excellent match to the ground truth, correctly identifying that the average cycle time cannot be derived due to the absence of temporal data (timestamps or durations). It provides a clear, evidence-based explanation without fabrication, directly addressing both parts of the user prompt (the impossibility of calculation and a brief explanation). The additional details on redacted fields and the irrelevance of the historical benchmark enhance clarity without introducing errors or deviations from the ground truth's core reasoning. No differences warrant point deductions under strict evaluation.
