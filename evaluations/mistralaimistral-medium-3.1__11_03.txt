7.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment), accurately quantifies their SLA breaches, and uses only bullet points for recommendations as instructed.
- Positive: Numeric exceedances are correct and calculation of average waiting times is directly based on table data.
- The recommendations are concrete and data-driven, in line with instructions.

However, there are several significant deviations from the ground truth that warrant point deductions:

1. **Invention of Metrics/Interpretations** (-1.0):  
   - The answer creates “% breach” and “% of total time” metrics (e.g., "50% breach", "waiting time = 67% of total") that are not in the supplied table. While the ratios use provided values, these derived metrics were not asked for and are not present in the ground truth.
   
2. **Overly Specific Recommendations Not Supported by Data** (-0.5):  
   - Proposals such as "parallel processing for low-risk cases using pre-approved templates" or "real-time data validation APIs" are more technical than the table supports; the ground truth uses more cautious operational suggestions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks", "add a risk analyst in peak window").
   - Estimated reduction targets for waiting time (e.g., "≥40%", "target: ≤360s") are completely invented and not grounded in the supplied data or requested by the prompt.
   
3. **Extraneous Information** (-0.5):  
   - The “Data source: Process metrics for 455–1,200 cases (Q1 2024)” note is invented; the month/year, range of cases, and context ("Q1 2024") are extrapolated and not directly from the table or prompt.
   - The subject line in the LLM answer includes invented effects like “impacting throughput and customer experience,” which is not mentioned in the ground truth or prompt.

4. **Lack of Projected Overall Outcome** (-0.5):  
   - The ground truth closes with a broad anticipated benefit ("reduce cycle time by roughly 35%"), which is not present in the LLM answer.

5. **Memo Formatting Differences** (-0.5):  
   - The LLM answer includes formatting differences (numbering, bold emphasis) versus the example style, though this is minor.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer demonstrates strong comprehension of the data and fulfills core instructions. However, the introduction of unsupported metrics, excessive specificity in recommendations, and small invented details are significant deviations, particularly given the instruction to "ground every sentence in the data supplied." Thus, with strict marking, 7.0 is appropriate.
