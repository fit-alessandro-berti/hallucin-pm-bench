### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth. It also accurately quantifies SLA exceedances in absolute seconds (+300s, +300s, +60s), aligning closely with the ground truth. However, under utmost strictness, several differences result in significant point deductions:

- **Invented metrics and derivations (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM introduces unprovided percentages (e.g., 50% breach for Legal Approval, 67% waiting time share), which violate the prompt's rule against inventing metrics. The ground truth sticks to absolute values only. Waiting time percentages (e.g., 80% for Risk Review) are similarly derived without data support.

- **Structural deviations (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: The prompt specifies "bullet points only for the recommendations." The LLM uses a numbered list for activities (with sub-bullets), while the ground truth integrates activities into bolded paragraphs without numbering. Memo headers differ (e.g., bolded vs. italicized; "From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "From: Process Performance Office"), and the subject line varies in wording and invented details (e.g., no "Q1 2024" in data).

- **Recommendations (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: While both provide one concrete action per activity in bullets, the content is entirely different and not aligned. LLM's actions (e.g., "parallel processing" with ≥40% reduction targets like ≤360s) invent specifics, quantified projections, and unsubstantiated data (e.g., "low-risk cases" routing) not in the table. Ground truth's actions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks" bypassing approval, "add one risk analyst") are differently worded and include unique inventions (e.g., "€25k" threshold, "peak morning window"), but the mismatch in phrasing and focus (e.g., no "straight-through heuristic" in LLM) counts as a full divergence. Neither is perfectly data-driven, but differences amplify the gap.

- **Introductory and closing content (minor deduction: -0.5 point)**: The LLM adds ungrounded impacts (e.g., "impacting throughput and customer experience") and a closing data source note with invented quarter ("Q1 2024"). The ground truth has its own inventions (e.g., "4 805 completed cases" – inaccurate sum from table data, totaling ~5,885; "April 2025 sample"; 35% projection), but the LLM's intro is more expansive and less concise.

- **Word count and overall fidelity**: Both ≈150 words, and the core analysis is grounded, but cumulative inventions and mismatches prevent a higher score. The answer is functional but not a close replica.
