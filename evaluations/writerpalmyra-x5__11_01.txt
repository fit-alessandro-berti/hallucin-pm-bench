9.2

**Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):**

- **Correctness (activities/numbers):** Perfect match. Top 3 ranked correctly by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1 36.5/120.0, Send_Closure_Letter #2 12.2/44.0, Assess_Liability #3 7.8/16.4). Numbers quoted verbatim with units.
- **No unwarranted content:** Fully compliant—no service times, throughput, or extra activities.
- **Format/conciseness:** Proper executive memo structure (To/From/Subject), ≤150 words (~110). Crisp and professional.
- **Actions:** Concrete, logically tied to waiting times, promise ≥20% reduction (stated explicitly "each action targets"). No unsupported data invented.
- **Differences from ground truth (deductions):** 
  - Action wordings differ (e.g., LLM's "automated reminders/digital checklists" vs. GT's "24h escalation"; "auto-triggered generation" vs. "e-signature on closure"; "AI case routing" vs. "rules-engine bypass"—similar intent, but not identical: -0.4).
  - No per-action % claims or fabricated "pilot/estimated" data (GT has them; LLM avoids, aligning with scoring notes but diverging: -0.2).
  - Style: Full memo vs. GT's bare list (-0.1); "95th %ile" vs. "p95" abbreviation (-0.1).
  
High score reflects near-perfect adherence, but strict diff-based grading penalizes non-identical creative elements/actions.
