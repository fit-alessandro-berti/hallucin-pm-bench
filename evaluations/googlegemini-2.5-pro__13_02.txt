The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. It correctly identifies the single occurrence in Q1, computes percentages precisely for Q2a/b (with explicit calculations matching ground truth), and for Q3 provides a concise (84 words) explanation that adheres to the criteria: (i) explicitly notes the single occurrence, (ii) addresses instability/variance (e.g., skewing averages, insufficient data for learning patterns, poor accuracy), and (iii) cautions against over-generalization (e.g., risky extrapolation, flawed conclusions). No deviations, inventions, or errors; format is clear and data-driven.
