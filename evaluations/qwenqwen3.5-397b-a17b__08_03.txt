**3.0**

The LLM answer has major differences from the ground truth and contains errors:
- **Incorrect shortest sequence**: Provides T1, T2b, T4, T5 (length 4) instead of the ground truth's T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3 (length 6, explicitly minimal for witnessing T5 *before* T3 with both firing).
- **Fails to demonstrate required ordering**: Sequence does not fire T3 at all, so does not prove T5 fires *before* T3 in a sequence containing both (ground truth uses feedback loop T6→pc→T3 to fire T3 after T5).
- **Factual error**: Claims "T3 never fires (as pc is never marked)", ignoring T6 (pf → pc), which enables pc and T3 post-T5.
- **Incomplete minimality argument**: Claims length 4 minimal but ignores need for T6/T3 to complete ordering (ground truth explains lower bound 4 + extras).
- Minor matches (yes answer, correct prefix markings, shortcut use) give partial credit, but strict evaluation penalizes all differences/errors heavily.
