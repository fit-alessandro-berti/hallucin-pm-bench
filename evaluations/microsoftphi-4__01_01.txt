### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially identifies decision points but introduces inaccuracies, omissions, and structural deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points (Major Flaws, ~40% Partial Credit)**:
  - Correctly notes the eligibility check in #1 (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility) and the threshold in #3 (high-value branch), aligning loosely with ground truth #1 and #2.
  - Frames Finance_Controller_PreApprove (#2) as a decision, but ground truth integrates it into #3 (final approval with Senior_Auditor_Review), without clear rejection outcomes.
  - Erroneously treats Process_Refund_Payment (#4) as a "decision point" (it's an execution step post-decision), which is not in ground truth and contradicts the prompt's focus on decisions.
  - Fails to explicitly summarize branching logic/outcomes for all points: Omits rejection/return for ineligible claims (ground truth #1), skips "≤ €1,000" branch explicitly (ground truth #2), and ignores rejection ending the process (ground truth #3). Descriptions are activity summaries rather than decision-focused.

- **Required Documents (Significant Omissions, ~20% Credit)**:
  - Lists 5 of 7 documents correctly but scatters them per stage instead of providing a complete, consolidated list as in ground truth.
  - Misses core artefacts: *RefundRequestForm* (essential for submission, step 1) and *RefundConfirmationPDF* (final output, step 6)—critical errors for completeness.
  - Notes *AuditTrail* as conditional (accurate), but doesn't frame it as "part of the catalogue" per ground truth, and ignores the note on no legacy activities/documents.

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness Penalties**:
  - Structure deviates: Uses narrative sections instead of table + list, making it less precise and harder to parse against ground truth.
  - Introduces interpretive phrasing (e.g., "guide the path... ensuring criteria") not in prompt or ground truth, risking addition of undefined elements.
  - Small errors compound: No mention of rejection paths (fundamental to decisions), incomplete document catalogue, and extra framing of non-decisions lead to substantial point loss. The answer is functional but ~60% divergent in accuracy and completeness.
