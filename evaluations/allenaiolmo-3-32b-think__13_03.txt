**7.2**

### Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Part 1 (perfect match)**: Correct count (1, specifies CaseID 1002); GT adds timestamp but not required. Full points.
- **Part 2 (major deductions)**: LLM under 120 words (good). Shares small sample idea but lacks GT's precision: no exact stats (14 events/3 cases/<2 hours), no frequency swing (0%-7%), no confidence interval/sampling error quantification, no rare-event emphasis, **misses critical near-synonyms** ("Automatic Fraud Check"/"Fraud Check (Automatic)") & string-matching pitfall. Adds speculation ("potentially atypical", "high-risk cases", "outlier") violating "no speculation" rule. GT is data-strict/statistically rigorous; LLM more general/vague. ~30% overlap, 70% divergence → heavy penalty per strictness.
