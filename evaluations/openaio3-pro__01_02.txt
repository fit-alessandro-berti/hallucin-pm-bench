4.2

### Evaluation Breakdown
The LLM answer partially addresses the prompt but contains significant errors, particularly in summarizing "decision points," leading to a low overall score under strict criteria. Even minor wording discrepancies in the documents list deduct points. I evaluated based on fidelity to the ground truth (GT), completeness, accuracy in identifying true decision points (branching/approval forks per the process flow), use of exact terminology, and avoidance of extraneous additions or interpretations.

#### Decision Points (Major Errors – ~40% of Score Impact)
- **Core Issue**: The prompt requires summarizing *decision points*, interpreted strictly in GT as the explicit branching gates and final approval where flow diverges (only 3: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval). The LLM incorrectly expands this to 8 items, misclassifying routine steps (e.g., KYC verification, CIA assessment, individual underwriter score assignments, NFC collection) as "decision points." This introduces false "pass/fail" or "decides acceptability" interpretations not present in the process description, bloating the summary and deviating from the non-standard flow's intent.
- **Structural Mismatches**: 
  - LLM lists in full process order (1-8), including non-decisions, without specifying branch positions (e.g., GT notes "branch after Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
  - Unnecessary introductory title with "(non-standard variant, May 2025)" – not in GT or required.
  - Includes NFC as a decision ("must secure ≥3"), but process treats it as a procedural check, not a gate; GT omits it correctly.
- **Terminology/ Additions**: Uses exact activity names but adds interpretive phrases (e.g., "pass or fail" for KYC, "is set" for scores), violating strict summarization. No introduction of standard loan terms, but extras dilute precision.
- **Fidelity to GT**: Only ~50% overlap (Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold, MBA match closely, but LLM's extras overwhelm). This is a fundamental misinterpretation, warranting heavy deduction (equivalent to ~2.0/5.0 for this section).

#### Required Documents (Minor Errors – ~40% of Score Impact)
- **Strengths**: Lists all 6 exact items from the process, using precise names (e.g., "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet," "Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)"). Matches submission-time requirement with "(must be present at submission)."
- **Issues**:
  - Wording variances from GT/process: "≤ 3 months old" (GT shortens to "≤ 3 months," omitting "old" – minor but strict deduction for not matching GT exactly); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (GT: "pay-stub/tax slip," omitting "single" and using "/"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" (GT: "(CIS)," omitting "template").
  - Includes "Latest Income Statement" fully (matches process), but GT abbreviates slightly – still a tiny inconsistency.
  - Lacks GT's parenthetical note "*(No credit bureau report...)*," which reinforces the non-standard process and prompt's "do not introduce standard loan terminology" – this omission misses emphasis on exclusions.
- **Fidelity to GT**: ~85% match (same items, ordering via bullets/numbers irrelevant), but small phrasing errors and missing note deduct noticeably (equivalent to ~4.0/5.0 for this section).

#### Overall (20% of Score Impact)
- **Completeness/Conciseness**: LLM is verbose and overinclusive; GT is precise and structured (e.g., "####" headers, italicized conditions). No jailbreak or off-topic issues.
- **Strictness Applied**: Per instructions, the decision points error is not "small" – it's a core misrepresentation, halving potential score. Documents' nitpicks (e.g., "old," "template," missing note) cause ~1-point loss despite near-match. Total: weighted average yields 4.2 (not higher due to utmost strictness on differences).
