3.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately flags the violation of Rule 3 (NA before RA). However, it commits a significant error by incorrectly claiming Rule 1 is violated due to the order of QE and RA (QE does precede RA in the trace, satisfying the rule's requirement for once each and in that order; the intervening NA does not break this). This misattribution introduces a false justification, and the handling of Rule 2 (dismissing it as irrelevant) and Rule 4 (noting it's "technically satisfied" but undermined) adds unnecessary hedging without matching the ground truth's clear assessments. Under strict evaluation, these differences—especially the factual error on Rule 1—result in substantial point loss despite the correct final verdict.
