3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and fidelity to the RACI assignments, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Format and Presentation (major deduction, -3.0 points)**: The ground truth uses a transposed RACI format (tasks as rows, roles as columns, with abbreviated R/A/C/I in cells, plus a legend and explanatory notes). The LLM uses the inverse (R/A/C/I as columns, full role names in cells) and includes an unnecessary initial flawed table followed by a "Corrected" version with extra explanatory text. This creates redundancy and messiness, violating the prompt's call for a single, clear Markdown table. No legend is provided, and tasks retain numbering/rephrasing from the source without the ground truth's clean, mandated-style headings (e.g., "**KYC Review**" bolded).

- **Roles (major deduction, -2.0 points)**: The ground truth includes "Operations Manager" (an unmentioned, non-mandated role) as the primary Accountable party across tasks, with assignments distributed accordingly. The LLM correctly limits roles to mandated terms ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") plus source-mentioned "IT Support", but this creates total misalignment in assignments (e.g., no "Operations Manager" means no equivalent accountability distribution). Empty cells ("-") in the LLM contrast with the ground truth's full assignments to all roles per task.

- **Tasks and Coverage (moderate deduction, -1.0 points)**: The LLM expands to 7 tasks (splitting step 5 into "Release payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent", and combining archiving with notification in task 7), while the ground truth consolidates to 6 without SWIFT as a separate item and omits explicit "notify" (though implied in "I" for Regulatory Liaison). Wording differs (e.g., LLM's "customerâ€™s transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM's "Archive case file and notify" vs. "Archive Record"), introducing minor rephrasings not aligned with the ground truth's concise, mandated phrasing. All source steps are covered, but the extra task and incomplete mapping (e.g., no consultation for sanctions screening in LLM) reduce precision.

- **RACI Assignments (major deduction, -2.5 points)**: Assignments diverge entirely, indicating poor mapping to the implied process logic in the ground truth. Examples:
  - Receive: LLM (R: Transaction Analyst, A: Regulatory Liaison) vs. ground truth (R: Transaction Analyst, A: Operations Manager, C: IT Support, I: Regulatory Liaison).
  - KYC Review: LLM (R/A: Regulatory Liaison, C: Transaction Analyst) vs. ground truth (R: Regulatory Liaison, A: Operations Manager, C: Transaction Analyst, I: IT Support).
  - Approve: Similar mismatch, with LLM lacking IT Support involvement.
  - Archive: LLM (R: IT Support, A: Regulatory Liaison, I: Regulatory Liaison) partially aligns but misses ground truth's C: Transaction Analyst and A: Operations Manager.
  These inconsistencies suggest the LLM invented its own logic rather than mirroring the ground truth's distribution.

- **Vocabulary and Prompt Adherence (minor credit, +2.0 points)**: The LLM strictly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions, matching the ground truth here. No omissions of source steps, but the self-correction and extra text dilute adherence to "organise the RACI matrix clearly."

Overall, while the LLM captures the source informally and uses correct vocabulary, the profound structural, role, and assignment differences result in a score far from perfect (10.0). Small issues like phrasing and empty cells compound to reflect incomplete alignment.
