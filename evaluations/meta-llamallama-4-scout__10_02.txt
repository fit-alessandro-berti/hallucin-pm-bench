3.5

The LLM answer exhibits some effort to use the mandated vocabulary (“KYC Review,” “Regulatory Liaison,” “Transaction Analyst”). However, there are several significant and structural errors and omissions that must be strictly penalized:

**Major Errors:**

1. **Omission of Operations Manager:** The role “Operations Manager” is entirely missing from the LLM answer. In the ground truth, this role is always Accountable (“A”) for every task, representing a critical oversight. All accountability mappings are incorrectly assigned to “Regulatory Liaison,” violating the process and role structure.
   
2. **Incorrect/Incomplete Role Assignments:** The LLM answer almost universally assigns “Regulatory Liaison” as both Responsible and Accountable for many steps (sometimes both at the same time), whereas the ground truth distributes R/A/C/I roles carefully among all actors.

3. **Consulted/Informed Columns Misuse:** The ground truth specifies considerable “Consulted” and “Informed” participation by each role, ensuring cross-functional communications, which the LLM answer ignores (many C/I entries are blank or incorrectly filled).

4. **Task Naming:** Several tasks in the LLM table are not properly mapped to the enforced/mandated vocabulary or do not follow precise naming, e.g. combining “Archive case file and notify” instead of separating to “Archive Record” and “Notify.”

5. **Formatting:** The table header lists only the mandated roles in the ground truth, while the LLM answer sometimes references “IT Support” with incorrect RACI assignments.

6. **SWIFT Message Task Inclusion:** The LLM answer introduces a “Ensure SWIFT message is sent” step, which is not a separate activity in the ground truth RACI—it is bundled into the payment release/IT Support steps.

**Minor Errors:**

- The LLM answer includes two full tables, one after the other, contributing to confusion.
- The task descriptions sometimes depart from the mandated vocabulary, even if not directly substituting banned synonyms.

**Conclusion:**  
- Use of forbidden/unaccounted roles (missing "Operations Manager").
- Incorrect allocation of accountability.
- Incomplete and missing cross-role consultations/informings.
- Occasional lack of adherence to mandated activities, structure, and vocabulary.

**Strict RACI grading therefore: 3.5/10** (Non-trivial effort shown, but major errors in compliance, coverage, and accuracy.)
