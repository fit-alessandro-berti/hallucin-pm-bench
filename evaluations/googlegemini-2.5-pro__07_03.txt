The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes, with all tasks and gateway changes accurately listed. However, it omits the dash ("-") before each item as specified in the ground truth answer. This is a formatting error that, per the instructions to evaluate with utmost strictness and penalize even small errors, warrants a significant penalty despite otherwise correct content and heading order. There is no other content or ordering error, so most points are retained.
