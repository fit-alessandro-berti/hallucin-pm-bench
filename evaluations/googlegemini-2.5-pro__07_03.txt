The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact IDs, names, and gateway type shifts, matching the ground truth content verbatim. However, under utmost strictness, minor formatting discrepancies result in point deductions: absence of bullet points (-) for all listed items (7 total instances across sections), and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry. These small presentation errors, while not altering meaning, deviate from the ground truth structure and warrant a significant but not total loss given the perfect substantive accuracy.
