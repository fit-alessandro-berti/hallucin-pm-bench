**3.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Semantic Equivalence (Major Partial Credit, but Deductions for Differences/Extras)**: 6/10. The LLM captures the full process flow per prompt (including the explicitly required "**checks warranty eligibility**" task omitted in ground truth), loop for re-validation, parallel activities, and required gateways/ends. However, vs. ground truth: extra task ("wrc_check_eligibility"), extra flow ("wrc_flow_4b" effectively), invented flow conditions ("incomplete", "within warranty"), gateway names ("Claim completeness check"), and different decision modeling (separate task + gw for eligibility vs. direct gw). Not identical semantics.
- **Structural/Validity Errors (Severe Deductions)**: -4.0 total impact.
  - **Fatal Invalid BPMN XML**: `wrc_request_missing_info` `<outgoing>wrc_flow_4</outgoing>` mismatches `wrc_flow_4` `sourceRef="wrc_gateway_completeness"` (not the task). BPMN parsers/tools will reject/fail. Ground truth has no such refs, all valid via flows only.
  - Non-pure output: Introductory text ("Here's the BPMN..."), post-XML list (1-7), and ````xml` fences. Prompt specifies "Return a single self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document" – ground truth is pure XML.
- **Exactness to Prompt/Ground Truth (Strict Verbatim/Format, Significant Losses)**: 4/10.
  - Task names **verbatim** to prompt bold text: LLM mostly exact (e.g., "validates the claim", "requests missing information", "checks warranty eligibility", lowercase where specified). Ground truth alters casing/tense (e.g., "Validate the claim") and omits one.
  - IDs prefixed "wrc_": Matches.
  - Gateways/ends: Exact count/types match prompt/GT.
  - But differences vs. GT: casing (e.g., "send rejection notice" vs. "Send..."), start/end names ("online warranty claim" vs. "Online warranty claim submitted"; "Completed" vs. "Successful end"), flow names absent vs. GT's "Yes"/"No".
  - Extra full `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` (~100 lines): Unnecessary bloat (GT minimal 34 lines, no DI). Prompt doesn't require diagram layout.
  - Verbose namespaces (`bpmn2:` prefix, extra xmlns): vs. GT's concise `bpmn:`.
  - Explicit `<incoming>/<outgoing>` refs: Redundant vs. GT's flow-only.
- **No Hallucinations/Omissions**: Full credit – no invented escalations/errors; all prompt elements present (unlike GT omitting check task).
- **Overall Strictness**: Base 7.0 for core logic → -3.8 for invalidity/extras/wrapper/format diffs. Small issues (casing, invented conds/names) compound to significant loss per instructions. Functionally ~80% usable if fixed, but strictly graded as-is.
