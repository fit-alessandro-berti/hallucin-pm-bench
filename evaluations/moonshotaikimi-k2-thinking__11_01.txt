### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities and metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities are correctly identified and ranked by waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). All quoted averages and 95th-percentile values are verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5h/120.0h, 12.2h/44.0h, 7.8h/16.4h). No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities mentioned. (+10/10)
- **Format and Constraints**: Crisp memo style with appropriate header (TO/FROM/RE), concise body under 150 words (~110 words). Ranks clearly as #1–#3. No violations on length or scope. However, the closing sentence introduces "cycle time" (unwarranted, as it indirectly relates to throughput/service, per prompt prohibition) and "customer satisfaction" (not required or tied to waiting-time data). (-0.8 for unwarranted content)
- **Actions**: Each is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time bottlenecks, and claims ≥20% reduction. Data-driven elements present (e.g., "pilots show >25%" for #1 aligns with ground truth's pilot reference; >30% and ~20% estimates are reasonable but less precisely sourced than ground truth's "estimated"/"targeting"). Phrasings differ slightly from ground truth (e.g., LLM's "SMS/email reminders" vs. ground truth's "customer reminders with 24 h escalation"; "eliminate batching" vs. "replace manual batch printing with e-signature"; "~20%" vs. "20–25 % decrease"), introducing minor invention (e.g., "<$5K" threshold not in data). Actions remain relevant without unsupported claims, but differences reduce fidelity. (-1.0 for phrasing variances and weaker sourcing on two actions)

Overall: High fidelity to prompt and table, but strict deduction for subtle violations (cycle time) and non-identical actions erode perfection.
