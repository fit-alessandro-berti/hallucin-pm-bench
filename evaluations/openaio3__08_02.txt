The LLM answer is factually correct, with the same minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) and accurate markings/explanation of T5 preceding T3 by consuming P2. Key concepts (alternative path via left branch, enabling/disabling) match the ground truth. Minor deductions for slightly less formal notation (e.g., "P1 + P2" vs. "M‚ÇÅ = { P1, P2 }"; no bolding; "minimal demonstration" phrasing vs. "Minimal firing sequence") and informal shorthand, which reduce precision under strict evaluation. No errors in logic or content.
