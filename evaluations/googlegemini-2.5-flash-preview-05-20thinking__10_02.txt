6.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer uses only the mandated vocabulary (“KYC Review,” “Regulatory Liaison,” “Transaction Analyst”) and does not revert to forbidden synonyms.
- The table is clear and formatted in markdown, as requested.
- Each activity in the process is reflected in the RACI table, with a reasonable mapping to the informal description.

**Major Errors and Point Deductions:**
1. **Omission of 'Operations Manager'** (–1.5):  
   The ground truth includes an "Operations Manager" as the Accountable party for nearly every task, but the LLM answer omits this role entirely. This is a significant omission in process mapping and organizational responsibility.
2. **Inaccuracy & Oversight in RACI Assignments** (–1.0):  
   Several activities are missing or inappropriately assigned RACI notations compared to the ground truth (for example, Screen Against Sanctions List has A assigned to Transaction Analyst instead of Regulatory Liaison; "Approve High-Risk Transaction" marks Transaction Analyst as "Informed" but should be Consulted, etc.).
3. **Non-mandated/Modified Task Names** (–0.7):  
   Several task/step names are not strictly aligned with those in the ground truth ("Receive & Log Transfer Instruction" instead of "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen Payment against Sanctions List" instead of "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission" instead of "Release Payment"; "Archive Case File" instead of "Archive Record"). Even though these are slight rephrasings, the vocabulary mandate was for *strict* adoption.
4. **Incorrect or Inambiguous Accountabilities** (–0.5):  
   The answer often conflates "R, A" (Responsible, Accountable) in a single role for several tasks (e.g., Transaction Analyst for multiple lines). In the ground truth, Accountability is kept mostly with the Operations Manager, never the Transaction Analyst, reflecting the specialization of duties; the LLM answer does not reflect correct segregation.
5. **Unclear Consulted/Informed Relationships** (–0.3):  
   For multiple activities, not all relevant roles are assigned Informed or Consulted status as in the ground truth (e.g., some steps in the LLM's answer are missing C/I slots for IT Support or Regulatory Liaison).

**Overall:**
- The submission is conceptually correct but lacks critical attention to both *who* is accountable (misses a whole role) and *how* tasks are labeled, which in turn affects regulatory and operational clarity.
- **Total: 6.0 is appropriate** for a mostly correct structure and terminology, but with significant omissions and non-strictness in both mapping and terminology.
