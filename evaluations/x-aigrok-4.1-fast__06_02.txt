**10.0**

The LLM answer perfectly identifies and enumerates the three parallel blocks from Process B (P1, P2, P3) with exact task names, correct order, and proper comma separation as specified in the prompt. No extraneous tasks, no mentions of other processes, and only concurrent tasks included. The absence of spaces after commas is a negligible formatting variation not mandated by the prompt ("separated by commas"), resulting in no meaningful differences from the ground truth content or structure. Under strict evaluation, this merits full marks for accuracy and completeness.
