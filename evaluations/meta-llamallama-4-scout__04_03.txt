8.0

- The LLM answer correctly analyzes all four rules, correctly identifies that rule 3 is violated (NA occurs before RA), and that rules 1, 2, and 4 would otherwise be satisfied.
- The answer structure is clear and logically walks through each rule.
- It correctly concludes "No" and provides an explicit justification referencing each rule as requested.

Errors/downscores:
- The justification for rule 4 is not strictly complete: it states "we can conclude ... without deeply evaluating rule 4" and only briefly notes that CC occurs after VP and NA, but doesn't explicitly state that rule 4 is satisfied as in the gold standard.
- The phrasing for the conclusion is less formal and slightly less concise than the ground truth.
- It lacks the explicit tabular organization and check/mark style of the gold standard.

Given the strict grading criteria (small errors reflected in significant loss), these presentation and completeness issues deserve a noticeable deduction, but the core logical analysis is sound and complete.
