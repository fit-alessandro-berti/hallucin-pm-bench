6.5

**a) Decision Points**  
The LLM answer identifies the two main decision points correctly and generally describes their logic, but:
- The wording for the Manual-Underwriting-Review trigger is a little sloppy: “bypasses manual underwriting if its risk is rated Low or Medium and the requested amount is €250,000 or less.” This essentially matches the process, but would lose points for not using the clearer "if-and-only-if risk in {Low, Medium} and requested amount ≤ €250 000" construction, and does not recapitulate the branching ("otherwise it proceeds to manual underwriting") as the ground truth does.  
- For "TriVote," the LLM says “at least two of the three required decision-makers (...) vote to approve it.” This matches the rule, though the ground truth uses slightly stronger wording (“record ‘Approve’”). Small imprecision.

**b) List of Required Documents**  
- The LLM omits “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” which appears in the ground truth list (between Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration). This is a concrete omission (document is actually listed in the process description at Step 8 and the ground truth). This merits a noticeable penalty.
- The LLM lists "ID Matrix Declaration" after "Offer Sheet 77," but misses that both "Signed Offer Sheet 77" and "ID Matrix Declaration" are required together (in Step 8).
- There are no hallucinated documents, which is good.

Because the biggest flaw is the omission of an actual process document (“Signed Offer Sheet 77”), combined with mild imprecision in the decision-point descriptions, but the overall structure is correct and there are no hallucinations or major misunderstandings, a strict score would be **6.5/10**.
