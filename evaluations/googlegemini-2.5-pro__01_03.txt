7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (8.0/10):** The LLM correctly identifies and summarizes the two decision points with accurate rules, closely mirroring the ground truth in substance (e.g., risk conditions for skipping step 5 and the 2/3 approval threshold for TriVote). Minor deductions for slight wording variances (e.g., "bypasses manual underwriting" vs. explicit "bypasses ... otherwise proceeds"; "vote to approve" vs. "record 'Approve'"; currency formatting "€250,000" vs. "€250 000") and not explicitly naming the first gate as "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check," which adds unnecessary looseness under strict criteria.
- **Part (b) - Documents List (6.0/10):** The list is mostly accurate in order and inclusion up to "Offer Sheet 77," with no hallucinations (e.g., correctly omits KYC/AML). However, significant errors include: (1) omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (explicitly listed in step 8, separate from the unsigned version in step 7), resulting in an incomplete tally of *all* documents (8 vs. 9); (2) incorrect sequencing by placing "ID Matrix Declaration" immediately after "Offer Sheet 77" instead of after "Signed Offer Sheet 77," per the process description's order in step 8. These omissions and reordering constitute non-trivial inaccuracies, warranting substantial point loss for failing to capture every required document precisely.
- **Overall:** Strong fidelity in core content and structure, but the incompleteness in part (b) prevents a higher score. No criminal or jailbreak issues detected.
