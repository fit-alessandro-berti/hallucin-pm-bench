The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks "Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code"; removed task "Send RMA Label"; gateway "gw_valid" change from exclusive to inclusive), matching the ground truth in core content. However, it loses points for omissions and formatting differences under strict evaluation: (1) excludes task IDs (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`) present in the ground truth, reducing factual precision from the XML; (2) omits version specifiers "(v1)" and "(v2)" in the gateway change; (3) uses "-" bullets instead of "*" and "â€¢" headings instead of "**bold**", deviating from ground truth style; (4) slightly different phrasing in the gateway entry (e.g., no backticks or bolding). These small but multiple discrepancies prevent a perfect score.
