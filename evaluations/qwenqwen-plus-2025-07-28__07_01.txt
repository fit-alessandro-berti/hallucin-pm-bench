- The LLM answer correctly identifies the added and removed tasks, and the gateway type change.
- However, it fails to use the element names as they appear in the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" instead of "check_vip", "Generate RMA QR Code" instead of "generate_qr", "Send RMA Label" instead of "send_rma_label"), as explicitly required.
- The gateway type change heading lists "gw_valid: changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway" instead of the more precise "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)", omitting the explicit XML element notation and versioning found in the ground truth.
- Headings slightly deviate in formatting (bullets instead of bold headings with line breaks).
- While the factual content is accurate, these presentational and naming errors are explicitly penalized per the instructions: "Use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML", "strictness", and "Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points".
- Therefore, these presentation/naming errors lead to a loss of 3 points.
