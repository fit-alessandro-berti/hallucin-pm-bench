The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in core reasoning (impossibility due to absent event data/timestamps in Artefact A) and fulfills the task's requirements precisely (explains why for all metrics, one short paragraph, no guessing). Minor deductions for stylistic/wording differences (e.g., opening phrase, explicit listing of metrics with "95%", detailed needs like "sample size" and duration derivation, explicit dismissal of Artefact B which GT omits) and slightly greater length, per strict difference-based grading. No factual errors.
