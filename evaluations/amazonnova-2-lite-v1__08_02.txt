**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: Q1 wrongly states "No" (ground truth: "Yes"), provides no valid firing sequence, and explanation misrepresents the net structure (ignores T7→P4 path enabling P5 without T3). All markings/sequence absent. Total deviation from ground truth; maximal errors.
