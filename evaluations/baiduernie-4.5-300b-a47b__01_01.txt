### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major issues, ~40% of score impact)**: The LLM answer identifies only two decision points, omitting the critical initial eligibility check in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** (explicitly described as validating against *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*, implying a clear binary outcome: eligible/continue vs. not eligible/reject). This is a fundamental step in the process and a significant omission under "every decision point." The identified points are partially accurate but lack the ground truth's detail on branching logic (e.g., no explicit "rejected → process ends" outcomes) and misplace the high-value branch timing (ground truth specifies "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**"). The final approval decision is implied but not distinctly summarized as in the ground truth's third point. Format is simpler (no table), reducing clarity. Strict penalty for incompleteness and lack of precision.
  
- **Required Documents (minor issues, ~60% of score impact)**: The list is complete and matches the ground truth, including the conditional *AuditTrail*. Both note its high-value limitation appropriately. However, the LLM omits the ground truth's explicit disclaimer about no other documents/legacy activities, which reinforces adherence to the prompt's constraints— a small but notable gap under strict evaluation.

Overall, the response addresses the prompt but with critical gaps in completeness and fidelity to the process description, warranting a mid-low score despite solid document handling.
