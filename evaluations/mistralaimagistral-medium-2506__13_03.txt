8.1

1️⃣ Accuracy:
- The LLM answer gives the correct count: "Manual Fraud Check" occurs 1 time, and the case is correctly identified as 1002. No error here.

2️⃣ Explanation:
- The answer covers several correct points: snippet size ("tiny subset..."), representativeness/selection bias, and notes that activity name variants may cause confusion.
- It mentions cherry-picking (“for_high-fraud applications”) as a source of bias, which is a relevant point about sampling error.
- However, it has a notable small error: "analysts might overlook rodent name inconsistencies"—the word "rodent" appears to be an unintentional mistake (likely meant "redundant" or similar). This is a minor but definite flaw.
- The explanation about possible over/underestimation due to sampling and naming variant confusion is well-founded, but the answer is much less precise and analytical than the ground truth. The ground truth quantifies (7%), highlights extreme sampling error due to excerpt size, and gives more rigorous reasoning.
- The LLM answer mentions "fuzzy matching may over-include them" only indirectly, not clearly distinguishing between strict matching vs fuzzy matching as the ground truth does.
- The mention of selection bias and representativity is appropriate, but the answer does not mention confidence intervals or the inherent volatility in frequency estimates in small samples.

Strictness:
- While mostly correct in content, the answer is less precise, omits specific sampling-error quantification, and includes a clear typographical error ("rodent"). The explanation is less thorough and less technically grounded.

**Final: 8.1—no major errors, but precision, technical clarity, and a typographical mistake warrant a significant deduction.**
