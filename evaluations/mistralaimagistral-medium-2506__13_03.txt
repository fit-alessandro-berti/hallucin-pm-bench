7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Q1)**: Exact match to ground truth (count of 1, correctly tied to CaseID 1002). No errors—full points here.
- **Part 2 (Q2)**: Covers core ideas (small sample size leading to unreliable frequency estimates; name variations like "Automatic Fraud Check" and "Fraud Check (Automatic)" causing misclassification risks via strict/fuzzy matching). Word count compliant (72 ≤ 120). However, strict deductions for: (1) Unquantified sampling issues—lacks ground truth's precision (e.g., 14 events/3 cases/<2 hours; frequency swing from 0% to 7%; wide confidence intervals; sensitivity to one line). (2) Introduces speculation on "selection bias/cherry-picking" (violates "no speculation" policy; absent from ground truth). (3) Significant typo ("rodent name inconsistencies"—likely meant "variant"; small error but major loss per instructions). Overall, strong conceptual overlap (~80% alignment) but flaws reduce accuracy/reliability.
