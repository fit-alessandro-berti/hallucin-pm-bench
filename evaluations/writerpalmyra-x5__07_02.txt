**8.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Content accuracy (10/10)**: All changes correctly identified—no misses, no extras. Added: 3 correct tasks. Removed: 1 correct task. Gateway: correct type change (exclusive to inclusive).
- **Completeness (10/10)**: Covers *all* changes under exact 3 headings; ignores cosmetics (e.g., names, flows, reorderings) as instructed.
- **Penalties (total -1.5)**:
  - List formatting: Bullets (-) vs. ground truth numbered (1., 2., 3.); minor but strict deduction (-0.5).
  - Task presentation: ID first ("name") vs. name bold first (`id`); reversed order, different styling (-0.5).
  - Gateway wording: "Exclusive Gateway → Inclusive Gateway" vs. "**exclusive** (XOR) ... **inclusive** (OR) in *v1* to *v2*"; misses abbreviations/context, capitalization/style diff (-0.5).
  - Minor: No "## Expected Answer Key" header or final "(No other...)" note; headings use "• **" vs. "* **" (-negligible, absorbed).
- Overall: Semantically identical but stylistic/textual differences warrant deduction under "utmost strictness" and "small errors significant loss." Near-perfect match.
