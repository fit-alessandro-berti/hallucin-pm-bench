**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct and complete. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the deterministic ground truth exactly (frequency: 1; 2.08%; 8.33%), including calculations, rounding to two decimals, and percentages of events/cases containing the activity. For 3, the ≤100-word (72 words) explanation meets all criteria: (i) single occurrence ("single data point", "one instance"); (ii) variance/instability ("cannot represent...mean or variance", "skewed"); (iii) over-generalization caution ("risky", "erroneously conclude"). All details (e.g., C05 timings ~37 min from data; auto cases >24h from data) are derived solely from the log without invention. No errors, deviations, or extraneous content; structure enhances clarity without violating instructions.
