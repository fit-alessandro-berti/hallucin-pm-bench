**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), which align perfectly with data-driven bottlenecks (e.g., highest wait/rework/SLA). Memo format is executive-appropriate (To/Subject), concise (~140 words <200), actions are concrete and tied to metrics (e.g., rework reduction, variability checklists), no mentions of absent activities, no guessing on ambiguous rankings.
- **Significant Differences & Errors (major deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Explanations deviate from ground truth & table emphasis** (-1.5): Misses key table facts like throughput drops (190 for Request_Documents), Review_Documents' longest processing (25 min, highest) & wait (30 min), Initial_Assessment's wait (18 min). Instead emphasizes stdev (valid but secondary) & questionable "short processing time (12 min)" (12 min is mid-range, not short; ignores wait). Ground truth prioritizes wait/processing/rework/SLA/flow impact; LLM selectively omits for 2/3 activities.
  - **Overstatements/hallucinations** (-0.8): "All other activities perform within acceptable thresholds (rework <1%, SLA breaches <1.5%)" – inaccurate (Check_Coverage SLA=1.5% not <1.5%; subjective "acceptable" not in table). Minor but strict policy flags as error. Interpretations like "upstream bottlenecks" for early-stage Initial_Assessment speculative.
  - **Actions similar but less precise** (-0.3): Concrete/data-driven (e.g., 50% rework target), but less innovative/impact-tied than ground truth (no AI/digital specifics, no end-to-end projections like 10% throughput lift).
  - **Structure/content gaps** (-0.2): No bolded metrics for emphasis (ground truth highlights numbers), weaker bottleneck/flow narrative, no projected impact.
- **Overall**: High alignment on core task (80% match), but metric omissions, factual inaccuracies, & explanation shifts = notable divergence. Strict rubric demands near-identical data fidelity; small errors compound to mid-high score.
