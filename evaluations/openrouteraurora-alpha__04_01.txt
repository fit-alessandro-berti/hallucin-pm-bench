8.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (high marks)**: Accurately identifies the trace as Non-compliant, correctly pinpoints violations in Rules 2 and 3 with precise event citations (e.g., Ship_Goods at 8 before Risk_Assessment at 9; Three_way_match at 10 after Goods_Received at 6). Correctly asserts Rules 1, 4, and 5 are satisfied.
- **Factual Errors (significant deduction)**: Rule 3 distance phrasing mismatch—"four steps later" vs. ground truth's explicit "distance = 3" (with rule specifying "distance ≤ 2"). This is a small but precise numerical/terminological discrepancy, warranting -0.8 per strictness directive.
- **Completeness/Structure (moderate deduction)**: Lacks ground truth's exhaustive per-rule audit (numbered 1–5, with detailed "Satisfied/Violated" status and evidence for *all* rules, e.g., Rule 1 PO amount/order details, Rule 4 Intern-CFO gap via event 4). LLM summarizes "all other rules satisfied" without citations, deviating from comprehensive audit style. Answer format is "numbered justification," but LLM only numbers violations (-0.8).
- **Formatting/Minor Issues (minor deduction)**: "Non‑compliant" (special dash) vs. "Non-compliant"; no bolded final summary or full rule-by-rule numbering (-0.2).
- **Overall**: Strong core match (same conclusion, same violations), but strict criteria penalize incompleteness and small discrepancy heavily. Perfect score requires near-identical structure/content.
