**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part a) (Decision points)**: Perfect identification of exactly 2 decision points. Rules described accurately in one sentence each, with no factual errors, omissions, or hallucinations. Minor deductions (-0.2 total) for: (1) non-identical titles/phrasing (e.g., "Manual Review Bypass" vs "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; "mandatory voters ... grant their approval" vs "approvers ... record “Approve.”"; no explicit "otherwise proceeds"); (2) added "(Branch)" / "(Gate)" labels not in ground truth or prompt.
- **Part b) (Documents)**: Exact match on all 9 documents, order, and separation (e.g., Signed Offer Sheet 77 distinct). Minor deduction (-0.1) for unasked extras like "(Step X: ...)" annotations and intro phrasing "(In order of first appearance)".
- **Overall**: Semantically flawless, no hallucinations/inaccuracies (e.g., no KYC mentions), fully responsive to prompt. High score reflects near-perfect fidelity despite tiny stylistic/textual divergences; strictness applied to phrasing/step extras as "small errors" warranting ~0.3 total loss from 10.0.
