4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Decision Points (Major Errors - 2.0/10)**: The LLM incorrectly identifies non-decision steps (Quick KYC Verification and Community Impact Assessment) as decision points, which they are not—these are linear verifications without branching. It partially captures the Underwriter Alignment Gate but inaccurately describes it as leading to "approval" (should be "continue") and omits the key escalation to the Harmonisation Committee. The Amount Threshold Decision is incomplete, mentioning only the ≥ €15,000 path while ignoring the < €15,000 auto-approval branch. Critically, it omits the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as a distinct decision point with approve/reject voting. These are substantial deviations from the ground truth's precise identification and details of the three true decision points, violating the prompt's emphasis on exact terminology and flow.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors - 8.0/10)**: The list is complete and uses correct names, but includes unnecessary additions like "single" in "single pay-stub or tax slip" (ground truth uses "pay-stub/tax slip"), "old" in "≤ 3 months old" (ground truth: "≤ 3 months"), and "template" in "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" (ground truth: "(CIS)"). It omits the ground truth's explanatory note on exclusions (e.g., no credit bureau), though this is not explicitly required. Under strictness, these wording tweaks reflect avoidable inaccuracies.

- **Overall Structure and Adherence (Weighted Average - 4.0/10)**: The response introduces errors in core process interpretation, fails to "use exactly the activity names given" without alteration, and does not fully summarize decision points as branching logic. Minor formatting differences (e.g., bolding vs. headers) are less penalizing, but the prompt's strictness on terminology and no standard loan terms amplifies the decision points' flaws. Total reflects ~60% misalignment, with small errors compounding the score loss.
