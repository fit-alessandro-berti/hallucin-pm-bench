The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content, structure, and formatting for all three questions: Q1 is identical (3); Q2 is identical in sequence and separators; Q3 lists the two distinct activities one per line in alphabetical order with no additions, omissions, or errors. Minor stylistic elements (e.g., bolding, analysis text, or exact dash presence) do not constitute factual differences or errors under the evaluation criteria.
