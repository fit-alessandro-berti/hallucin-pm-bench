The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth for all three questions:

- **Q1:** Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases.
- **Q2:** Lists the correct chronological activity sequence for case C002 with the exact format requested.
- **Q3:** Identifies both activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") that immediately precede "Ship_Order" in all cases and presents them in the correct alphabetical order, one per line.

No errors or omissions are present, and instructions (including formatting) are followed precisely.
