The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel sets and their tasks, matching the core content of the ground truth. However, it loses points for formatting differences (e.g., no descriptive labels like "Set 1 – first parallel block," no backticks around task names, comma separation instead of "‖" symbol, absence of bolding, and omission of the explicit statement "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel"), which introduce small but noticeable deviations under strict evaluation criteria.
