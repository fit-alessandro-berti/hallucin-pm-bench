9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks and presents them in the correct order, matching the process structure strictly and giving no extraneous info about other processes, as required. The only difference is the omission of explicit labels ("first parallel block", "second parallel block"), the use of list numbering instead of explicit "Set X" wording, and the formatting (uses commas instead of â€–). There is also a lack of the summary sentence ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel.").

According to the instruction to be "utmost strict", these minor presentation and completeness issues warrant a markdown, but the core information and correctness are fully present. Hence, a 9.0.
