**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1**: "1" vs. ideal "`1` occurrence". Minor wording omission ("occurrence"); factual match. -0.2 deduction.
- **Q2**: "5.56%" vs. ideal "`5.56 %` (calculation: $1 ÷ 18 × 100 = 5.56$ %)". Correct value/rounding, but missing space before % and explicit calculation. Small formatting/omission errors. -0.3 deduction.
- **Q3**: "A1002" vs. ideal "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”.". Correct identifier listed concisely, but lacks ideal verbosity/context for clarity. Minor stylistic difference. -0.2 deduction.
- **Q4**: Both reasons valid and map directly to ground truth (a = "Temporal bias"; b ≈ "Small sample size" + "Case-mix bias", clearly stated). Minor phrasing deviation (e.g., no explicit "high variance" quantification, slight hypothetical "others never did" edging inference). Negligible, full credit.
- **Overall**: Factually perfect (no hallucinations, strict adherence to log), but small wording/formatting/verbosity differences across Q1-Q3 warrant significant deductions per instructions (~0.7 total loss). High score reflects excellent core accuracy.
