The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, with correct answers for all three questions. Minor formatting differences (e.g., numbering as "1." vs. "A1", bullet style "-", inclusion of "distinct" in Q1, lack of underscore escape in A2) do not constitute errors in the strict sense of factual accuracy or required output structure, as both adhere to "concise, bullet-point answers only" and match the expected responses precisely where it matters. No point loss applied.
