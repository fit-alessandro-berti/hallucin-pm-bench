The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, asserting impossibility where the ground truth demonstrates it is possible (and provides a valid firing sequence: T1 → T2 → T5 → T3 → T4). The LLM's proof misinterprets enabling conditions for T5 (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0), incorrectly assuming T3 must precede T5 due to later consumption by T4, ignoring reachable states where T5 fires immediately after T2 while p4 remains empty. This reversal of the correct conclusion, combined with logical errors in the analysis (e.g., confusing inhibitor arc semantics and token flow), warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
