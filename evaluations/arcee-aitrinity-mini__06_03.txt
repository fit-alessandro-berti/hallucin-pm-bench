9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Content Match (Perfect, +10/10):** Both identify exactly the two correct concurrent sets from Process B in the correct order: {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory} and {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}. No extraneous tasks, no mention of Processes A/C. LLM adheres strictly to the prompt's focus.
- **Structure & Numbering (Excellent, +9.5/10):** Numbered 1. and 2. sequentially as required. Minor deduction for introductory sentence ("Based solely..."), which is redundant/unnecessary verbiage not present in ground truth (GT), slightly deviating from a pure "list."
- **Formatting & Presentation (-0.8 total):** 
  - Lists pairs with comma separation ("Task, Task") vs. GT's descriptive headers ("**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), backticks (`Task`), and ‖ symbol. Functional but not identical representation (-0.4).
  - No bolding, descriptive labels, or closing sentence ("No other tasks...") from GT (-0.3). Prompt doesn't mandate these, but strict textual diff penalizes absence.
  - Extra spacing ("1.  ") minor nit (-0.1).
- **Strictness Adjustment:** Semantically flawless, but visible textual/formatting diffs (e.g., no ‖, no labels) warrant deduction per "small errors... significant loss" and "more differences... lower grade." Not identical, so capped below 10.0. Total: 9.2.
