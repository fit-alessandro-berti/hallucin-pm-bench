**2.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses **Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring** exactly as mandated. No disallowed synonyms leak. However, invented names for additional activities (e.g., "Approval (Escalated)", "Payment Scheduling") violate "do not rename" by not matching ground truth phrasing.
- **Activities (major violation, -3.0)**: Adds 4 extra/renamed rows ("Approval (Escalated)" ≠ "Compliance Officer Approval"; adds "Payment Scheduling", "Notification"; "Fund Release" ≠ "Release Funds"). Ground truth has exactly 6; LLM has 8. Direct violation of "do not rename, merge, or add activities" and "covering **every activity**" (infers beyond narrative precisely as GT does).
- **RACI assignments (major errors, -3.5)**: ~70% of cells differ significantly:
  | Activity | Key Differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | CompA: I vs C; CompO: I vs – |
  | KYC Review | Front: C vs –; CompO: I vs C |
  | AML Screening | Front: I vs – |
  | Risk Scoring | Front: I vs C; CompA: R/A vs R; CompO: C vs **A** |
  | Extras | All 4 rows absent/renamed in GT; invalid. |
  No "R, A" bolding; uses R/A shorthand inconsistently; I used instead of – for no involvement.
- **Format (minor errors, -1.0)**: Markdown table present, but lacks GT's bolding (**R, A**), dashes (–), precise headers/alignment. Extra rows disrupt fidelity.
- **Overall fidelity**: ~30% match to GT (only core 4 activities partially align). Strict policy demands perfection; multiple small errors (e.g., I vs –, shorthands) compound to major loss. Total reflects high divergence.
