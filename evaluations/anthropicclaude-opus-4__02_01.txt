- Q1: The number of distinct case IDs is correctly identified as 3.
- Q2: The activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in A-9321 is correctly identified as "Pack_Items".
- Q3: The earliest timestamp is correctly extracted.
- Q4: The count of "Quality_Check" is correct (2).
- Q5: The list of activities that never appear as the first event matches exactly ("Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order").
