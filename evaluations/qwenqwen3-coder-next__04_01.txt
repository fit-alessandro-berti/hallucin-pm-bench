**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct overall verdict ("Non-compliant"). Accurately identifies violations in Rules 2 and 3 with correct reasoning (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods; Three_way_match too late). Rules 4 and 5 correctly assessed as compliant. Covers all 5 rules with citations, matching required format basics.
- **Major deductions (-2.0 total)**:
  - **Rule 1 confusion and mislabeling** (-1.0): Labeled "**Rule 1 violation**" despite concluding compliant; rambling backtrack ("satisfying... However... actually compliant") introduces false doubt and deviates from ground truth's clear, concise "Satisfied."
  - **Rule 4 mislabeling** (-0.5): Labeled "**Rule 4 violation**" despite concluding satisfied — inconsistent and misleading vs. ground truth's "Satisfied."
  - **Rule 3 distance mismatch** (-0.5): States "distance = 4" vs. ground truth "distance = 3" — direct factual difference, even if violation agreed.
- **Minor deductions (-1.0 total)**:
  - Excessive verbosity, bold/italics/* formatting, unnecessary notes ("but note:", "So no violation here"), and redundant summary not in ground truth's clean, concise style (e.g., ground truth uses exact "Satisfied/Violated" per rule).
  - Slight phrasing diffs (e.g., ground truth notes "event 4 lies in between" for Rule 4; LLM more scattered checks).
- **Why not lower?** Core logic sound, no wrong violation claims or missed rules. Why not higher? Strict policy: presentation errors/mislabeling (not small) and numerical diff cause significant loss; >3 clear differences from ground truth.
