**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies **Yes** with a valid, minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 fires before T3, includes precise markings (e.g., explicit p4=0), and provides a brief justification tied to concurrency and the inhibitor arc condition, fully addressing the prompt's requirements without errors. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking the ground truth's stronger "must fire before T3 if ever" insight and detailed enabling condition formalization (`p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0`); (2) shorter justification without permanence explanation; (3) not extending the sequence post-T5 or matching exact phrasing/formatting. No credit lost for avoiding ground truth's sequence error (invalid T4 firing after T5 consumes p3). High fidelity overall under strict evaluation.
