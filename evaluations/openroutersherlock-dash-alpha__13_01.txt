The LLM answer is an exact match for the ground truth across all questions, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. It adheres strictly to the provided log data, provides precise calculations, and offers two clear, relevant sampling-related reasons for Q4 that align directly with the ideal options (temporal bias and small sample size). Minor formatting variations (e.g., spacing in percentages or verbosity in Q3) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as the core content is identical and derivable solely from the log.
