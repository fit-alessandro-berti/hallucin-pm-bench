### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in core correctness (identifies and ranks the exact three worst activities by average waiting time: Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3; quotes avg and 95th-percentile times verbatim from the table) and avoids prohibited content (no service times, throughput, or extraneous activities). It stays under 150 words (149) and provides one action per activity, each logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., customer delays, handoffs, bottlenecks) with an explicit ≥20% reduction claim.

However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:
- **Format and structure differences (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: The LLM uses a full memo header, intro paragraph, and "Next Steps" conclusion, adding verbosity and elements not present in the ground truth's concise list format. This exceeds the "crisp" intent and introduces unwarranted content.
- **Action differences (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: Actions are relevant and concrete but deviate notably from the ground truth (e.g., LLM's SMS/email reminders vs. ground truth's 24h escalation with pilot data; automated integration vs. e-signature replacement; junior reallocation vs. rules-engine bypass). While both promise ≥20% cuts, the LLM's lack explicit "data-driven" elements like pilots or estimates cited in the ground truth, making them less aligned.
- No major errors in numbers or activities, but these cumulative differences reduce fidelity.

This scores high for accuracy but penalizes deviations as per instructions.
