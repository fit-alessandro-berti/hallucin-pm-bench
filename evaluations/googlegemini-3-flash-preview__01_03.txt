**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part a) (Decision Points)**: Major deduction for identifying **3 decision points instead of exactly 2** as in ground truth. The first two summaries are nearly identical to ground truth (minor phrasing diffs like "does not exceed" vs. "≤ €250 000" and "Pass via approvals" vs. "record 'Approve'" are small but deduct slightly under strictness). The third ("Applicant Confirmation") is a **hallucinated/invented decision point** – Step 8 is a sequential step, not a "gate or conditional branch" per the process or prompt. This violates "every" (all and only), akin to hallucination warned in ground truth note. ~60% accuracy → heavy loss.
- **Part b) (Documents)**: Perfect match – all 9 documents in exact first-appearance order, no extras/missing, no hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML). 100% accuracy.
- **Overall**: Strong on b) and core content of a)1-2, but critical error in completeness/accuracy of a) (wrong count + fabrication) prevents higher score. Strictness applied: ~1.5-2.0 pt loss per small phrasing + 2.0+ pt for extra point. Format/verbosity ignored as not accuracy-focused.
