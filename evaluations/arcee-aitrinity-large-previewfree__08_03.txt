**8.0**

The LLM answer is correct in concluding "yes" and identifying the key shortcut path (T2b enabling pd without pc/T3), with accurate step-by-step analysis and the full sequence mentioned incidentally. However, strict evaluation reveals notable differences from ground truth:

- **Primary error (major deduction -1.5 pts)**: Presents T1-T2b-T4-T5 (4 steps) as the "**shortest** firing sequence where T5 fires before T3", but omits T6-T3. Ground truth interprets "shortest firing sequence" as the minimal one *including both* T5 *before* T3 (6 steps, argued as minimal with lower bound explanation). The 4-step proves T5 fires *without* prior T3 but fails to demonstrate the full ordering with T3 *after* (requiring feedback), misaligning with query intent and ground truth. Claiming 4 as "shortest possible" contradicts ground truth's minimality for the complete proof.

- **Presentation/structure (-0.3 pts)**: Chatty ("Let me analyze..."), embedded analysis without numbered steps/markings per firing or "**Why this works**" section. Ground truth is direct, formal, with per-step markings, compact syntax, and explicit proof of feasibility/minimality.

- **Minor omissions (-0.2 pts)**: No bolded "Yes", less emphasis on feedback loop's role in re-enabling T3 post-T5; ground truth details this critically.

Core logic/path matches perfectly (9/10 potential), but differences in sequence completeness, claimed shortness, and polish warrant deductions under utmost strictness.
