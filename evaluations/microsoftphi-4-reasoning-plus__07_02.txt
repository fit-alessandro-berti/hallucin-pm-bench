9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and follows instructions carefully. It:

- Correctly lists all and only the relevant changed tasks, with correct IDs and names.
- Identifies the correct gateway-type change, names the relevant gateway, and correctly interprets “cosmetic renamings.”
- Uses the required three headings, and groups the entries accordingly.
- Avoids listing unordered flows or any extra changes, as instructed.

**Minor Issues:**
- Its main heading and list formatting are slightly inconsistent: sometimes it includes commentary in the gateway-type changes section ("note that the name changed from... which is considered cosmetic"), which, while correct, slightly exceeds the minimal wording and stylization of the ground truth, and could be a little more concise.
- The answer does not redundantly supply both the task names and the IDs together for added/removed tasks (the ground truth includes both, e.g., **Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)), however the meaning is clear and the IDs that are used are unambiguous.

**Conclusion:**  
These are extremely minor in the context of the requirements, but per your instruction to be “utmost strict,” there is a slight deduction for not strictly matching the style/format in the ground truth and for the mild extra commentary. Otherwise, the answer is functionally perfect.

**Final Score:** 9.5
