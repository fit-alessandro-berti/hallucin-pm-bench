7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and pinpoints the key violations (Rules 2 and 3), aligning with the ground truth's core conclusion. It also accurately assesses Rules 1, 4, and 5 as satisfied. However, under strict evaluation criteria, several differences and errors deduct points significantly:

- **Structural and formatting issues (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: The response includes unnecessary self-corrections (e.g., "initial assessment was incorrect" in Rule 1; "correction: initial assessment misapplied" in Rule 4), making it verbose, hesitant, and less professional than the ground truth's clean, concise numbered list. The format deviates by adding a "Summary of Violations" and repeating "Final Answer," which exceeds the prompt's specified "numbered justification that cites the relevant rules."

- **Factual error in Rule 3 (significant deduction: -1.0 points)**: The LLM incorrectly states the distance as 4 (and inconsistently phrases it as "3 activities after"), while the ground truth specifies distance=3. Although both agree on violation, this numerical discrepancy is a small but clear calculation error in a rule that explicitly references "distance â‰¤ 2," warranting a notable penalty for imprecision.

- **Minor inconsistencies (minor deduction: -0.5 points)**: Rule 1 starts with an erroneous "violation" label before retracting it, introducing confusion not present in the ground truth. Rule 4's explanation is slightly redundant but correct. No other major content errors, but these small phrasing issues compound the messiness.

Overall, the answer is substantively strong (80% alignment in logic and citations) but undermined by presentation flaws and the distance error, preventing a higher score. A perfect match would require exact mirroring of the ground truth's brevity, accuracy, and tone.
