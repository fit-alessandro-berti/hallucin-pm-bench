3.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric)
- **Vocabulary Compliance (mandated, +2.0 max)**: Perfect. Uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly; no forbidden terms. (+2.0)
- **RACI Cell Accuracy (core content, +6.0 max)**: 13/24 cells mismatch GT (e.g., Row 1: CO "I" vs "C", IT "–" vs "I"; Row 2: 4 diffs incl. CO "R/A" vs "R"; Row 5: 3 diffs). No row fully matches; violates "exactly one Responsible" inference in some GT contexts due to deviations. (-4.8 from max)
- **Structure & Formatting (+1.0 max)**: Table present, but column headers abbreviated (AM/CO/FC/IT vs full "Account Manager" etc.); inconsistent bolding (GT bolds primaries like **R**/**R/A**); uses "–" inconsistently vs GT's "I". (-0.7)
- **Unwarranted Content (+1.0 max)**: Extra intro sentence and Legend (GT has none); no extra tasks/roles, but additions violate minimalism. (-0.6)
- **Overall Fidelity to GT/Narrative (+0.0)**: Major deviations from process roles (e.g., GT CO "R" solo for KYC vs LLM "R/A"; AM "C" for Record Update vs "A"); fails strict "reflect narrative" per notes.

Total: 3.2/10.0 (partial credit for vocab/table skeleton; heavy deductions for content errors per "utmost strictness").
