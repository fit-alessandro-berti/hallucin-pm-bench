6.0

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM answer lists four decision points:
    1. Tri-Color-Risk-Check (mischaracterized as a decision point, but it's just a classification, not a process gate or branch).
    2. Manual-Underwriting bypass rule (correct, matches the process as described).
    3. “TriVote” gate (correct, accurately summarizes the approval rule).
    4. Applicant-Confirmation gate (this is not a process decision point in the process definition—finalization depends on applicant confirmation, but the process step 8 is not defined as a decision point in the original process).

- The ground-truth answer only includes two true decision points:  
    1. The risk/amount-based conditional branch (step 4/5).
    2. The TriVote approval gate.  
- The LLM invents decision points ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check" and "Applicant-Confirmation") that are just procedural steps, not process gates/branches per the prompt and instructions.
- The LLM's summary of the Manual-Underwriting bypass rule and TriVote gate is acceptably close to ground truth.

**b) Documents**

- The document list is in the correct order and complete, matching ground truth exactly.

**Scoring Rationale**

- **Major errors:**  
    - Invents two decision points which do not exist per the precise definition in the process description and ground truth; this displays a misunderstanding of the request for "every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch)," which includes neither mere classification steps nor document-collection steps.
- **Minor errors:**  
    - The wording for the two real decision points is accurate and concise.
    - Document listing is perfect.

Given the strictness required and the critical misunderstanding on what constitutes a decision point, even though the document list is flawless, a significant point deduction is warranted. The result is a 6.0.
