6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, focusing on accuracy, completeness, fidelity to the process description, and absence of hallucinations or inventions. Minor wording differences cost points (e.g., "gatekeepers" vs. "approvers"), and major issues like extraneous decision points result in substantial deductions. The score reflects the overall response, weighted by part (a) being more interpretive and thus penalized more heavily for errors.

#### Part (a): Decision Points (Score: 5.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Points 2 and 3 closely match the ground truth's two decision points. The bypass rule (LLM point 2) accurately captures the conditional branch after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (ground truth point 1), including the exact rule phrasing ("Low or Medium AND ... ≤ €250 000"). The TriVote description (LLM point 3) is nearly identical to ground truth point 2, correctly stating the "at least two of three" rule and naming the roles.
- **Weaknesses** (significant deductions for strictness):
  - Includes 4 points instead of the ground truth's 2, inventing two non-decision elements as "decision points" (gates or conditional branches), which is a hallucination/misinterpretation:
    - Point 1 treats the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a decision point, but it is merely a step that *produces* an outcome (risk rating); the actual conditional branch is the post-check skip (already covered in point 2/ground truth 1). This doublings the content incorrectly and deviates from "every decision point (gate or conditional branch)."
    - Point 4 fabricates an "Applicant-Confirmation gate" with a described rule, but step 8 is a simple request for documents with no explicit decision rule, gate, or conditional branch in the process description—it's not a decision point like TriVote. Ground truth omits it entirely, confirming this as extraneous.
  - Minor wording issues: "Jointly classify" in point 1 is imprecise (scorecards are inputs, not the decision); "give an approval" vs. ground truth's "record 'Approve'" is a small but notable deviation; "the deal moves" in point 4 uses casual phrasing not in ground truth.
- No hallucinations of forbidden elements (e.g., KYC/AML), but the extras inflate and distort the summary, violating "one sentence each" by adding unneeded content. This halves the score despite capturing the core two points.

#### Part (b): Documents List (Score: 9.5/10)
- **Strengths**: The list is complete, correctly identifies all 9 documents/items, and orders them by first appearance matching the process (e.g., Form 14B in step 1; scorecards as distinct inputs in step 3; Deck Memo in step 5; Offer Sheet 77 in step 7; Signed version + ID Matrix in step 8; Loan Dossier in step 9). Treating Signed Offer Sheet 77 as separate from the unsigned version aligns with ground truth and the description.
- **Weaknesses** (minor deductions for strictness):
  - Formatting inconsistencies: "Scorecard – Cyan" uses a space-hyphen instead of ground truth's en-dash ("Scorecard–Cyan"), and minor spacing in titles (e.g., "Scorecard – Cyan" vs. exact "Scorecard–Cyan"). This is a small error but reflects lack of precise replication.
  - No other issues; avoids hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC docs).

#### Overall Score Justification
- Part (a) drags down the total due to major structural errors (extra points as inventions), despite good coverage of essentials—strict policy demands low tolerance for additions that alter the summary.
- Part (b) is near-perfect, boosting slightly.
- No policy violations (e.g., no criminal assistance), but evaluation is purely on fidelity to ground truth and prompt. A perfect score would require exact matches without extras or formatting slips.
