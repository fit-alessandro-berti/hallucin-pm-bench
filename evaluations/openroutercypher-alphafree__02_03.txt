9.5

- The LLM answer is almost perfectly aligned with the ground truth, providing all correct answers.
- For Q1, it offered a slightly more verbose answer ("There are **3 distinct cases** represented by the unique `case` attribute values 'C123', 'C456', and 'C789'.") instead of the concise format expected ("3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"), but the content is identical.
- For Q2 and Q3, the answers match exactly, though Q3 adds "in case C789," which, while correct, slightly exceeds the conciseness requirement.
- These minor stylistic differences (verbosity and extra detail) warrant a small deduction, but the factual content is flawless.  
- Thus: **9.5/10**.
