- The LLM answer is factually accurate and directly addresses all three questions, matching the ground truth content precisely (3 cases with correct identifiers; "Pack_Items" for A2; "Cancel_Order" for A3).
- Minor deductions for format (numbered list instead of bullets) and slight verbosity (e.g., extra phrasing like "There are **3 distinct cases** represented by..." and "in case **“C789”**" in A3), which deviates from the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction despite not introducing errors.
