**10.0**

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth: correctly deems the fact inaccurate ("No." vs. "inaccurate"), covers all three cases with precise sequences/ordering evidence (reversed in 1001/1003, absent in 1002 disproving "always"), cites required case IDs and activities verbatim from the log without addition/guessing, and remains short/evidence-based. Stylistic differences (e.g., no line numbers, no summary sentence, differing bolding/structure) are minor and do not alter factual accuracy or compliance with the user prompt/system role. No errors.
