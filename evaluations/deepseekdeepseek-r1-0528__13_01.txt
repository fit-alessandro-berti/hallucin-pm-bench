9.3

**Evaluation:**

1. Correct answer: "**1 time** (observed only in Case A1002)" — Matches ideal ("1 occurrence").  
2. Correct: "5.56%" (rounded to two decimals), with correct calculation shown. Matches exactly.
3. Correct: "**A1002** (only case...)" — Matches ideal.
4. Both reasons are appropriate and clearly sampling-related:
   - "Time period restriction...only a single day..." == "Temporal bias" in the ideal, though could be a touch stricter about 'morning' versus 'single day'.
   - "Unrepresentative data size/sampling bias...only one fraud check..." == "Small sample size" in the ideal.

**Minor deductions:**
- Point 4’s first bullet refers to "single day" rather than specifically "morning", which doesn't perfectly match the ground truth's precision (but the principle is nearly identical).
- In bullet two, "Unrepresentative data size/sampling bias" is a little less specific than "high variance" or "single extra occurrence would change...", but still covers the main concept.
- Could more directly state “high variance” or the effect of a single additional event.

**There are no hallucinations, all statements are constrained to the data, and answers are precise. Minor imprecision in language in part 4 warrants a fractional deduction, but not more.**

**STRICT grading: 9.3/10**
