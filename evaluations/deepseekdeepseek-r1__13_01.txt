9.5

1. The LLM correctly stated that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time. (Full match.)
2. The percentage given is 5.56%, with calculation (1/18), correctly rounded. (Full match.)
3. The LLM correctly lists A1002 as the only case containing "Manual_Fraud_Check." (Full match.)
4. The two sampling-related reasons provided are: "Limited time frame" and "Small sample size." These correspond well to "temporal bias" and "small sample size" from ground truth, both clearly stated.

Minor deduction (0.5):

- For question 4, the LLM gives "limited time frame" instead of the more specific "the snippet covers only a short time window (morning of 1 May 2025)", and "small sample size" but does not mention the magnitude of possible percentage swings (Â±5.56 pp) or explore other sampling caveats (case-mix or truncation biases). There is also no mention that observed orders may not represent those likely to trigger fraud checks. While the two answers are valid and acceptable, they're not as complete as the best possible answer per the rubric (which prioritizes specificity and breadth for sampling caveats).

No hallucation or unjustified inference is present. All answers are supported by the 18 lines.

**Final score: 9.5** (slight markdown for less detail in sampling-related biases, otherwise perfect factual accuracy)
