9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). No loss.
- **Question 2**: Matches the calculation and rounded percentage precisely (5.56%). Minor formatting difference (no space before "%" in LLM answer), but negligible. No loss.
- **Question 3**: Substantially matches; identifies the correct single case (A1002). Phrasing is slightly less emphatic ("the case identifier... is A1002" vs. "Only case A1002 contains"), and prompt specifies "identifier(s)" (plural), but since only one exists, this is a trivial deviation. Minor deduction (-0.2).
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid sampling-related reasons that align with ground truth categories ("Small sample size" directly matches; "Limited time frame" matches "Temporal bias"). Reasons are clear, derived from log (single day, 4 cases), and avoid unjustified inferences beyond the example of potential variation (which is a reasonable elaboration without hallucinating events). However, lacks the deeper specificity in ground truth examples (e.g., variance quantification or other biases like case-mix/survivorship), making it slightly shallower under strict scrutiny. Moderate deduction (-0.3).

Overall, the LLM answer is highly faithful to the ground truth, with no hallucinations or assumptions about unlisted events. The minor phrasing and depth issues warrant a small deduction for utmost strictness, but it remains excellent.
