4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Major factual error (significant deduction)**: Completely missed the removed task `send_rma_label` (name="Send RMA Label"), incorrectly stating "(none)" for Removed tasks. This is a core, directly observable XML difference (present in v1, absent in v2), violating the "factual differences" mandate. Under utmost strictness, this alone warrants severe penalty (~50%+ loss).
- **Added tasks (partial credit)**: Correctly identified both `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, but format deviates: uses id-first "`id` (name=...)" vs. ground truth's name-first "(id = `id`)". Names quoted exactly, but order and phrasing not matching ground truth or prompt's "element names exactly" intent.
- **Gateway type changes (mostly correct)**: Accurate change detection (`gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`), but lacks ground truth's explicit "(v1)" / "(v2)" versioning and bolding on types. Minor but strict deduction.
- **Formatting/structure (minor deductions)**: Headings use "• **Heading**" (close to prompt's "• Added tasks" but adds bold); lists use "–" vs. ground truth "*". No "(No other differences...)" note. Deviates from ground truth's exact presentation.
- **Overall strictness**: 2/3 categories accurate, but critical content omission + format mismatches = low score. No speculation (good), but incompleteness fails the task. Perfect match would be 10.0; this is ~40% alignment.
