The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in content, structure, and reasoning: it correctly identifies non-compliance ("No"), references all rules with appropriate satisfaction/violation assessments, and provides concise justifications matching the ground truth's key points (e.g., NA violation due to occurring before RA). Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., list format vs. table, addition of position numbers not in ground truth, extra heading) and slightly more verbose phrasing, which introduce negligible but present variances under strict evaluation.
