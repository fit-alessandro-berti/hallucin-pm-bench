5.0

### Evaluation Notes (for transparency, not part of the scored response)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the overall answer as "No" and pinpoints the key violation in Rule 3 with accurate reasoning (NA before RA). Assesses Rules 1 and 2 as satisfied after self-correction, aligning with ground truth.
- **Weaknesses (major deductions under strict criteria)**: 
  - Significant sloppiness in justification: Includes internal contradictions (initially claims violations for Rules 1 and 2, then "waitâ€”correction"), rambling thought process ("this seems satisfied... wait"), and unnecessary repetition, deviating from a "short justification."
  - Misassesses Rule 4: Incorrectly implies it's violated ("CC is also invalid") due to upstream issues, whereas ground truth explicitly marks it as satisfied (CC occurs after NA and VP as required). This is a factual error in rule referencing.
  - Format mismatch: No structured table or clear per-rule breakdown; instead, a messy bullet-point narrative, reducing clarity and precision.
  - Overall verbosity and lack of conciseness: Ground truth is tabular and succinct; LLM answer is ~2x longer with filler, violating "short justification."
- **Scoring Rationale**: Core decision matches (4/10 base), Rule 3 exact (2/10), but deductions for Rule 4 error (-2), sloppiness/contradictions (-2), and format/content mismatches (-3). Strictness applied: Even minor reasoning flaws (e.g., self-corrections) treated as significant deviations.
