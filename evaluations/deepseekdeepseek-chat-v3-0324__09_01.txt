The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly refusing to provide a numeric value, clearly stating the impossibility, and explaining the absence of timestamps/durations as the core issue. It matches the system's policy on data-supported responses and addresses the benchmarks' irrelevance (a relevant detail not in ground truth but not conflicting). Minor deductions for slightly more verbose phrasing (e.g., extra note on cycle time definition and benchmark segment) and not explicitly mentioning "ordering information" or "fabricated" answers, which are present in ground truth, but these do not introduce errors or deviations in logic or conclusion.
