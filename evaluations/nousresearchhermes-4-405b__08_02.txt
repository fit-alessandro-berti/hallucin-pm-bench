The LLM answer is incorrect for both questions. 

**Major issues:**
- For Q1, it answers "No" instead of the correct "Yes."
- For Q2, its explanation is wrong: it claims a sequential dependency (that T3 must fire before T5) which does not exist, and fails to recognize the true token flow and concurrency in the net.

**Positive:**  
- The answer references the places and transitions, showing an attempt to reason about enabling conditions and flow.

**Deduction reasoning:**
- The fundamental logical error in both answers—particularly missing the concurrent/exclusive nature of the splits and joins—merits severe penalization.
- The explanation is detailed but fully incorrect in reasoning.
- The only (small) credit is given for some reference to Petri net concepts.

**Overall:**  
While an attempt at explanation is made, both the decision and the reasoning are wrong. The answer is not just incomplete, but misleading, warranting a very low score.
