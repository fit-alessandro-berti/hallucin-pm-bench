The LLM answer incorrectly states "No" for Q1, directly contradicting the ground truth's "Yes." Its Q2 explanation misinterprets the net structure (e.g., claiming T3 consumes from P4, when T3 produces to P4 from P2) and fails to provide a valid sequence, instead offering flawed reasoning that ignores the alternative path via T7 for marking P4. This results in zero alignment with the ground truth, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
