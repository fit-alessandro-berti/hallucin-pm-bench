7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Part 1**: Exact match to ground truth count (1 occurrence). Minor addition (specifying CaseID) is accurate but unnecessary; no deduction.
- **Part 2**: Captures core ideas of small sample size and naming inconsistencies (e.g., variants like "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), staying under 120 words (~85). However, significant omissions include no mention of precise sample limitations (14 events, <2 hours, 3 cases), dramatic frequency swings (e.g., 0% to 7% impact of one event), wide confidence intervals, or rare-event sampling errorâ€”key to ground truth's statistical emphasis. Introduces mild speculation (e.g., spikes from workload/rule changes), violating "no speculation" rule, unlike ground truth's data-focused critique. These differences reduce precision and depth, warranting a notable penalty under strict criteria.
