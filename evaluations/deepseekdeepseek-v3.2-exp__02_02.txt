The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, structure, and formatting requirements across all questions: Q1 is precisely "3"; Q2 lists the correct sequence with "â†’" separators and underscores; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") alphabetically, one per line (via LaTeX line breaks in the boxed answer, and plain lines in the summary). No additions, omissions, hallucinations, or deviations detected, even under strict evaluation.
