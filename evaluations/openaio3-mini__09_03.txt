The LLM answer is accurate in substance and explains clearly why no metric can be calculated, closely matching the ground truth. It correctly notes the lack of data, cites the missing timestamps, and does not speculate. However, it is somewhat more verbose than requiredâ€”it uses more general language ("all detailed values... redacted, and no records or numerical timestamps...") rather than specifying as the ground truth does ("Artefact A contains only column headers; all event rows and every timestamp... redacted"). The core reasoning is identical, but the LLM answer could lose up to 1 point for not mirroring the precision and tightness of the ground truth language, which the task asks to uphold strictly.
