### Evaluation

**Added tasks**
- The LLM answer lists:
  - Task_VerifyIdentity
  - Task_RequestDocs

  **Error**: It omits "Final Reject" (`Task_FinalReject`), which is a new task present in v2 but not in v1—a significant omission.

**Removed tasks**
- The LLM answer says "None".

  **Error**: It misses an explicit removal: "Reject Loan" (`Task_RejectLoan`) is in v1 but not v2. This is a key removal and the omission is significant.

**Gateway-type changes**
- Correctly identifies:
  - Gateway_Decision: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway
- Extra detail ("now supports multiple outgoing flows...") is acceptable but not required.
- Gets the core change accurate.

**Overall**
- Omits a required added task and a required removed task, both plainly visible in the BPMN versions.
- All headings are present and respected, but two categories are incorrectly populated.

**Deduction rationale**
- Omission of one added task (~2 point loss)
- Omission of the only removed task (~2.5 point loss)
- Gateway-type change correct, heading structure respected (+only minor deduction)
- No extraneous or incorrect information, but misses critical items
- These errors are substantial and merit a score well below "adequate".

**Final strict score:** 4.0
