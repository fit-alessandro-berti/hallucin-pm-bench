### Evaluation Explanation
The LLM answer partially identifies some changes but contains critical omissions and inaccuracies when strictly compared to the ground truth and the BPMN XMLs:

- **Added tasks**: Correctly identifies "Verify Identity" (Task_VerifyIdentity) and "Request Additional Documents" (Task_RequestDocs), but completely misses "Final Reject" (Task_FinalReject), which is a new task in v2 connected via the "ineligible" flow. This is a major error, as the prompt requires summarizing *all* changes. The descriptive phrasing (e.g., "A new task added between...") adds unnecessary detail not present in the ground truth, deviating from a strict summary. Penalty: Significant deduction for incompleteness.

- **Removed tasks**: Incorrectly states "None," omitting the clear removal of "Reject Loan" (Task_RejectLoan) from v1, which has no equivalent in v2 (replaced by the new "Final Reject," but still a removal). This is a fundamental error in capturing the full diff. Penalty: Severe deduction for factual inaccuracy.

- **Gateway-type changes**: Accurately notes the change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway for "Gateway_Decision," including a brief explanation of the implication (multiple outgoing flows). This aligns well with the ground truth, though the example phrasing (e.g., "supports multiple outgoing flows simultaneously") is slightly interpretive but not erroneous. No major penalty here.

Overall, the answer fails to cover all required changes (missing 1/3 additions and the sole removal), violating the "summarise *all* changes" directive. Structure follows the headings but lacks the ground truth's concise, numbered format. Under utmost strictness, even partial correctness yields a low score due to these high-impact errors.
