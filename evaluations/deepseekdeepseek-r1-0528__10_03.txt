5.0

**Justification with Strictness:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer consistently uses the mandated terms **“Intake Vetting”**, **“KYC Review”**, **“AML Screening”**, and **“Risk Scoring”** for the specified activities (no synonym leak).
- No disallowed synonyms appear in the output.
- All process activities from the narrative are covered in some form.

**Significant Deviations (each a major error):**

1. **Activity Naming Deviations:**
   - The LLM invents/uses activity labels **not in the ground truth**, e.g.:
     - **Approval** (should be “Compliance Officer Approval” and scoped precisely)
     - **Schedule Payment** (not present or required—ground truth covers this only implicitly via “Release Funds”)
   - The LLM omits **Compliance Officer Approval** as an explicit activity label (required in the ground truth).

2. **Incorrect RACI Assignments:**
   - **Intake Vetting:** The ground truth assigns “C” (Consulted) to Compliance Analyst and “I” (Informed) to Treasury Ops, but the LLM omits these participants.
   - **KYC Review**/**AML Screening**: The ground truth correctly indicates “C” (Compliance Officer) and “I” (Treasury Ops); the LLM omits these.
   - **Risk Scoring:** The ground truth splits “R” (Responsible) to Compliance Analyst and “A” (Accountable) to Compliance Officer, with “C” (Consulted) for Front-Office Analyst and “I” (Informed) for Treasury Ops. The LLM collapses R/A to Compliance Analyst and omits others.
   - **Compliance Officer Approval:** The ground truth is clear on roles; the LLM spreads “Approval” across Compliance Analyst (C), Compliance Officer (R, A), misses the explicit “I” (Front-Office Analyst), and does not name the activity exactly.
   - **Release Funds:** The ground truth has multiple C/I roles; the LLM gives only “I” to Front-Office Analyst, no “C” to Compliance Analyst or Compliance Officer.

3. **Activity Breakdown Error:**
   - “Schedule Payment” is not an approved or named explicit ground truth step.
   - The conditional logic via footnotes is not supported in ground truth, which models each activity unconditionally as a row in the matrix.

4. **Role Coverage:**
   - The LLM omits “–” (dash) for no involvement (required by the ground truth formatting standard). Instead, empty cells are left.
   - The ground truth gives a **much more granular mapping** of who is Consulted/Informed; the LLM’s mapping is far more simplistic and omits many RACI entries.

**Conclusion:**  
While the LLM answer follows the *terminology* policy and avoids all forbidden terms (a critical requirement), its RACI assignments, activity delineation, and fidelity to the reference answer are significantly insufficient for a top score. The matrix is missing authorized participants on multiple activities, rebrands and consolidates activities against policy, omits required consults/informs, and has structural errors in presentation.

Given the rubric (“Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points”), a **score of 5.0** is strict, reflecting that it didn’t break vocabulary rules but failed substantially on the RACI mapping.
