2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Strength, partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms from the narrative. This avoids major policy violations and warrants some baseline points. No synonyms appear in explanations or elsewhere.
  
- **Activities Coverage and Integrity (Major Violations, severe deduction)**: 
  - Prompt requires covering "every activity... described above" without renaming, merging, or adding. The narrative implies six distinct steps: intake (vetting), KYC, AML screening, risk scoring, conditional approval/escalation, and release (including scheduling/notifying).
  - LLM adds an unauthorized activity ("Schedule Payment"), which is not explicitly mandated and merges/renames the narrative's "Compliance Officer approval" to a generic "Approval". Ground truth uses "Compliance Officer Approval" to precisely reflect the role-specific escalation without adding or genericizing.
  - This results in 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6, introducing extras and deviations. Strict policy violation: -4 points deduction.

- **RACI Assignments (Critical Errors, heavy deduction)**:
  - Assignments diverge substantially from ground truth across nearly all cells, missing key involvements (e.g., no "C" for Compliance Analyst/Officer in Intake Vetting; no "C" from Front-Office in Risk Scoring; no "A" for Officer in Risk Scoring; incomplete "I"/"C" for Release Funds).
  - For core activities:
    - Intake Vetting: Misses "C" (Compliance) and "I" (Treasury).
    - KYC/AML: Misses "C" (Officer) and "I" (Treasury); incorrectly assigns "A" to Analyst (ground truth has "R,A" but with broader involvement).
    - Risk Scoring: Fundamentally wrong—LLM assigns full "R,A" to Analyst only; ground truth splits "R" (Analyst), "A" (Officer), "C" (Front-Office), "I" (Treasury).
  - For added/renamed activities: "Approval" misses "I" (Front-Office); "Schedule Payment" ignores all other roles' potential involvement; "Release Funds" misses "C" from Compliance/Officer.
  - No use of dashes (–) for no involvement, using blanks instead—minor format inconsistency. These are not minor; they misrepresent accountabilities, violating RACI completeness. -3.5 points deduction.

- **Format and Output Structure (Minor Issues, small deduction)**:
  - Markdown table is present, but extras (title, key, footnotes, notes) go beyond "return the matrix as a Markdown table". Ground truth is table-only, implying minimalism.
  - Bolded activities and superscripts add unnecessary elements; ground truth boldens only role assignments (e.g., **R,A**). Footnotes interpret/escalate conditions not in the matrix itself, potentially confusing. -0.5 points.

- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the answer fails on core instructions (activities/RACI accuracy) despite vocabulary success. It attempts a logical interpretation but introduces errors that compound (e.g., 7+ differences in content/structure). Baseline 5.0 for partial compliance, minus 4.5 for violations = 0.5, rounded up slightly to 2.5 for recognizing mandated terms and producing a table.
