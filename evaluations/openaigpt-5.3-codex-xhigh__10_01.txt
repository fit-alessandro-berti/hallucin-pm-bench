### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary adherence (mandated terms)**: Perfect (10/10). Uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly; no forbidden terms. Matches ground truth and policy.
- **Structure & unwarranted content**: Major deductions (2/10). 
  - Headers include extra "(AM)", "(CO)", etc. (unwarranted abbreviations/parentheticals; ground truth uses clean full names only).
  - Extra "**Legend**" section introduced (not in ground truth; RACI terms are standard, no need).
  - No extra tasks/roles/columns, but formatting deviates (e.g., no alignment dashes, no bolding on **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** row labels as in ground truth).
- **RACI correctness vs. narrative & ground truth**: Significant errors (3/10). One R per row (good, A/R counts as single Responsible), AM Accountable on its tasks (arguably appropriate), but 8+ cell mismatches vs. ground truth:
  | Activity | Mismatched Cells (LLM vs. Ground Truth) |
  |----------|-----------------------------------------|
  | Receive Application | CO: I vs. C |
  | KYC Review | AM: C vs. A; FC: I vs. C (CO A/R ≈ **R**, minor) |
  | Order Vetting | None (A/R ≈ **R / A**) |
  | Payment Clearance | AM: C vs. A; CO: I vs. C (FC A/R ≈ **R**) |
  | Record Update | FC: I vs. C (notation minor) |
  | Notify Customer | FC: C vs. I |
  - Notation inconsistent (**A/R** vs. **R / A** or single **R**/**A**; legend defines separately but uses hybrid).
- **Overall**: ~60% alignment but strictness demands near-exact match (content + format). Multiple small errors (cells, bolding, headers, extras) cause outsized penalty per instructions. Core policy met, but fails precise replication.
