The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, identifying the correct and only two parallel pairs from Process B, sorted alphabetically both within pairs and overall. The format adheres to the specified structure (one pair per line, using "Task_X  â€”  Task_Y"). Minor visual spacing differences in the ground truth (likely for alignment) do not constitute an error, as the LLM follows the explicit format without deviation. No other tasks are included, and Process A is ignored as required.
