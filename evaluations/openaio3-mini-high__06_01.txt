9.0

The LLM answer correctly identified both pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel: 

- Create_Documentation — Quality_Check  
- Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines  

It also presented them in alphabetical order within each pair and overall (with Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines, and Create_Documentation before Quality_Check).

**Reason for 1.0 point deduction:**  
The only minor flaw is the alignment of whitespace: the ground truth answer alligns the second pair so the "—" signs are vertically aligned by using extra spaces in "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines", whereas the LLM answer uses single spaces. Strictly, the prompt asks for "Task_X  —  Task_Y" per line, but does not stipulate whitespace quantity, though the ground truth does include it. Given the instruction for "utmost strictness" and for even small errors to result in loss of points, I am deducting a point for slight formatting mismatch.

Otherwise, substantively and in logical ordering, the answer is flawless.
