7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth. It accurately quantifies SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s) and references relevant data like average times, waiting times, and case volumes without inventing metrics. The memo format is professional, uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations as required, grounds everything in the table data (no absent activities or metrics), and approximates 150 words (~170). Recommendations are concrete and data-driven, tying directly to quantified issues (e.g., "reduce by at least 300s," "compress the 480s waiting").

- **Weaknesses (Deductions for Differences)**: Structural variances from ground truth include missing "From" line, slightly different subject line wording, and no bold formatting or activity naming style (ground truth uses bold headers for activities). The introduction differs: LLM focuses on "SLA breaches combine with elevated waiting times" without mentioning total cases (ground truth invents "4 805 completed cases," which isn't in the data but adds specificity). Activity descriptions integrate case volumes (helpful but not in ground truth) and embed them in paragraphs rather than list format. Most critically, recommendations diverge entirely—LLM's are generic reallocations/prioritizations linked to data numbers, while ground truth provides more inventive, specific actions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k") plus a closing projection ("reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35%"), which the LLM omits. These content and stylistic mismatches, even if the LLM adheres more strictly to "no inventing," represent notable differences under strict evaluation criteria, warranting a deduction from a perfect score. Small omissions (e.g., no closing projection) compound to prevent higher marks.
