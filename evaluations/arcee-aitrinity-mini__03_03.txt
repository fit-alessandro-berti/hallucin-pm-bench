**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Major structural omissions (severe deductions: -4.0)**: Missing "Request missing information" task (critical for step 2 loop; ground truth includes `wrc_request_info`). No parallel split gateway (prompt requires explicit pair for step 4; ground truth has `wrc_parallel_split`). `wrc_schedule_courier` has no incoming sequence flow (orphaned task).
- **Invalid XML/syntax errors (-2.0)**: Duplicate `sourceRef` attributes in `wrc_sflow5`/`wrc_sflow6` (prevents parsing). Inconsistent namespaces (`bpmn` vs. `bpmn2` mixing). No `<?xml>` declaration. Missing flow from `wrc_check_warranty` to `wrc_warranty_gateway`.
- **Wrong element types/flows (-1.5)**: `wrc_parallel_join` declared as `exclusiveGateway` (must be `parallelGateway` for synchronization; ground truth uses correct type). No proper parallel split/join wiring (direct flows bypass split). Extraneous `wrc_check_warranty` task with broken paths (ground truth omits, using gateway directly post-validation).
- **Non-verbatim/inaccurate names (-0.5)**: Task/gateway/event names deviate (e.g., "Validate claim" vs. verbatim/prompt-expected "validates the claim"/ground truth "Validate the claim"; "Start" vs. "Online warranty claim submitted"; "Close claim" vs. "close the claim"/"Close the claim").
- **Partial matches (+1.0 partial credit)**: All IDs prefixed `wrc_`. Exactly 2 end events. Most other tasks present verbatim (e.g., "Create shipment order"). Some flows/loop intent captured.

Total: Fundamentally non-equivalent (invalid, incomplete flow; ~15+ differences vs. ground truth's minimal-correct 34-line XML). Not renderable or semantically matching prompt/ground truth.
