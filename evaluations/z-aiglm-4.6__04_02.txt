5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Matches status and justification (minor phrasing difference, no impact). Full points.
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores post-Change_Request approval timing, misapplying "last required approval." Major error, significant deduction.
- **R3**: Matches status and justification fully. Full points.
- **R4**: Matches status and justification fully. Full points.
- **R5**: Status correct, but justification incomplete (omits Ship_Goods as a "further processing step" after Change_Request). Partial deduction for inaccuracy.
- **R6**: Matches status and justification fully. Full points.
- **Overall**: Correct (both NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by R2 error affecting compliance assessment.
- **Format/Conciseness**: Adheres to requirements (statuses, â‰¤20-word justifications, all-caps conclusion), but no table as in ground truth (not required, minor note).

Strict scoring reflects critical factual errors in rule interpretation (R2) and detail omission (R5), halving the score from a potential 10.0.
