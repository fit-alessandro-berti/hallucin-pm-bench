### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three worst activities by average waiting time are accurately identified and ranked (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability). Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5h/120.0h, etc.). No other activities or metrics (e.g., service time in discussion, throughput rates) are introduced beyond the required waiting times. (Full points here.)
  
- **Format and Constraints**: Crisp memo format is executive-appropriate, under 150 words (128), and focused solely on the prompt's requirements. No extraneous discussion of service time, throughput, or unrelated topics in the body. (Full points.)

- **Actions**: Each is concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for variance in #1, e-delivery for #2, dedicated resources for #3). All promise ≥20% reduction explicitly. They are data-driven via references to table elements (e.g., 95th percentile variance, execution volume). However, minor deductions for:
  - Action #2 explicitly mentions "leverages low service time," violating the strict "Do not discuss service-time" rule—a small but clear error warranting significant point loss per instructions.
  - Action #3 references "310 executions," which borders on discussing throughput (case volume as a flow metric), though not as severe.

- **Differences from Ground Truth**: High similarity in structure (ranked list with actions), core content (activities/metrics), and adherence to rules. Differences are mainly in action specifics (e.g., LLM's automation/e-delivery/dedicated assessors vs. ground truth's reminders/e-signatures/rules-engine)—these are valid alternatives fulfilling the prompt, so minimal penalty. Ground truth is more concise/snippet-like, but LLM's full memo better suits "executive memo." No invention of unsupported data beyond logical ties (both answers do this mildly). Overall, very close, but the rule violations create a 1.8-point deduction from a potential 10.0 for utmost strictness.
