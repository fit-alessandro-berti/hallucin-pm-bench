2.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect in answering both questions. For Q1, it says "No, T5 cannot fire before T3," while the ground truth explicitly says "Yes" and provides detailed reasoning. For Q2, the LLM gives an incorrect explanation suggesting T3 must precede T5, which is false. Additionally, the firing sequence listed by the LLM ([T1, T2, T7, T4, T3], then T5) describes T5 firing *after* T3, missing the essence of the question.

Only minimal tokens are retained for mentioning the relevant transitions and interpreting the net structure, but the crucial part (possibility to fire T5 before T3) is completely missed. Thus, a strict grade of 2.0 reflects some marginal process understanding but a fundamentally wrong answer.
