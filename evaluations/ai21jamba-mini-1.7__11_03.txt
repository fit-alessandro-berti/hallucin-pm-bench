3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt's requirements, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences and errors (each contributing to point deductions):

- **Factual Inaccuracies in Quantification (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: Core prompt requires precise quantification of SLA exceedances. LLM incorrectly states Credit Assessment exceeds by 160 seconds (67%) instead of +60 seconds (300 - 240 = 60). Risk Review's "500%" exceedance is wrong (600 is 200% of 300, or +100% exceedance). Legal Approval's "50%" is inconsistent/miscalculated (900 is 150% of 600). LLM invents "80% over the target" for Risk Review waiting time, but no waiting targets exist in the data, violating "ground every sentence in the data; do NOT invent metrics." Ground truth uses exact +300s, +300s, +60s without erroneous percentages.

- **Ordering of Activities (Deduction: -1.0 point)**: Prompt specifies "three worst-performing" based *jointly* on SLA breaches *and* high waiting time. Legal Approval (highest wait 600s, +300s) should rank first, followed by Risk Review (480s, +300s), then Credit Assessment (200s, +60s). LLM incorrectly orders Risk Review first, then Credit Assessment, then Legal Approval, mismatching ground truth's logical prioritization.

- **Structure and Formatting (Deduction: -1.0 point)**: Prompt mandates "bullet points *only* for the recommendations" and "return *only* the memo text." LLM integrates recommendations into activity bullets (not separate), adds markdown title, greeting, signature, and closing paragraph—extra elements absent in ground truth's concise To/From/Subject, analysis paragraphs, and isolated "**Recommended actions**" bullets. This bloats the memo (~250 words vs. ground truth's ~120, exceeding ≈150-word guideline).

- **Recommendations (Deduction: -0.5 point)**: Must be "one concrete, data-driven action" per activity, using bullets only for them. LLM's are vague/integrated ("investigate inefficiencies," "review workload," "explore parallel processing") and not fully data-grounded (e.g., no table basis for "manual review bottlenecks"). Ground truth's are more concrete (e.g., "add one risk analyst to the peak morning window") but both invent details (e.g., GT's "€25k," "35% reduction"—violations, yet LLM's are less precise/mismatched). Still, LLM fails to isolate bullets and match GT's specificity.

Minor positives (e.g., correct activity selection, some accurate throughput/SLA mentions) prevent a 1.0, but cumulative errors in a data-grounded, precise memo justify 3.5—strictly penalizing all deviations as instructed.
