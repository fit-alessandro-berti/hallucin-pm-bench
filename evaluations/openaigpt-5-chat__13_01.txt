The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth across all questions, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. It adheres strictly to the provided log data, answers every question directly, and provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons for Q4 that align with the specified examples (small sample size and temporal bias). Minor formatting differences (e.g., wording in Q1 or spacing in Q2) are negligible and do not warrant point deduction under the evaluation criteria.
