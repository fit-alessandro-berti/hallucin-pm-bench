The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt's requirement with a clear explanation of the limitation, aligning closely with the ground truth in substance and structure. Minor differences in phrasing (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; omission of "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals") prevent a perfect score under strict evaluation criteria.
