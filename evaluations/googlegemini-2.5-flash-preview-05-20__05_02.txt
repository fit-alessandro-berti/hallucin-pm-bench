4.0

The LLM answer correctly modifies only an attribute of an existing element (the `camunda:dueDate` of "Collect Equipment") and outputs a valid unified diff with a single hunk and a one-sentence rationale matching the requested format.

However, there is a significant deviation from the ground truth:  
- The LLM changes the due date from **P5D to P1D**, while the ground truth requires a change from **P5D to P2D**.
- The LLM's rationale is overly generic and does not specifically reference the contractual 3-day SLA, as the ground truth does.
- The LLM's suggested change may push the process unrealistically, whereas the ground truth carefully aligns with the specified contract limits.

Due to the incorrect new value and the less precise rationale, a major deduction is necessary. However, the answer remains structurally compliant with rules, so a score of **4.0** is warranted.
