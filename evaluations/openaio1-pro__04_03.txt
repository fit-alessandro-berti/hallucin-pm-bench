The LLM answer correctly identifies non-compliance ("No") due to the key violation in Rule 3, with accurate assessments for all rules. However, it loses points for minor omissions: Rule 1 does not explicitly confirm "once each" (a required element), Rule 2 omits reference to the "High" severity attribute (directly relevant), and the overall format lacks the structured table while using less precise phrasing in some justifications. Under strict evaluation, these small differences warrant a deduction despite the strong substantive match.
