### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Exact match (1 occurrence). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Exact match (5.56%, with correct calculation shown). No deduction.
- **Question 3**: Lists the correct case (A1002), but phrasing is less precise than ground truth (omits "only" and full sentence structure for clarity). Minor deduction (-0.3 points).
- **Question 4**: Correctly identifies and explains two valid reasons (small sample size and temporal bias), aligning with ground truth options and stated "clearly." However, explanations lack the depth/specificity of ideal examples (e.g., no mention of variance impact, exact time window like "morning," or Â±5.56 pp. change; rephrasing in final answer slightly dilutes focus on "sampling-related"). Significant deduction for reduced precision under strict criteria (-0.5 points total).

Overall, the response is highly accurate, derives only from the log, and avoids hallucinations, but strictness penalizes minor phrasing gaps and explanation brevity.
