9.0

The LLM answer is very strong and closely matches the ground-truth, but with minor areas where strictness demands a small penalty:

1. The answer for question 1 is correct and explicit: “1”.
2. The calculation for question 2 is shown with formula and answer: “5.56%” (correct, exactly matches ground truth).
3. Question 3 correctly identifies: “A1002”.
4. For question 4, the model first provides two well-explained points (small sample size and temporal bias), and then in the bulleted summary, restates these (essentially the same two). This fits two acceptable ground-truth bullet points, but is slightly less explicit in mentioning the very short time window (mentions "single day" and "collected over a single day", which is clear enough). The answer does not mention possible case-mix or survivorship bias—however, only two reasons are required, and the ones given are valid.

The answer does *not* hallucinate any information not present in the logs, and all figures and conclusions are strictly log-derived.

**Deduction**: For minor redundancy in the last explanations (listing the same two reasons twice) and for not explicitly noting that the dataset covers only a part of the day (minor wording strictness), and lack of total specificity in question 4, I deduct 1 point.

**Final Score:** 9.0
