**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a)** (major differences, significant deduction): LLM correctly identifies and describes the two actual decision points (risk-based skip and TriVote) in accurate one-sentence rules matching the ground truth semantically (e.g., "Low or Medium **and** ≤ €250,000" skip; "at least two of three" for TriVote). However, it erroneously adds a third "decision point" for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself, which is merely a step producing an input *for* the conditional branch (not a gate/conditional branch per the prompt/process). This constitutes a clear misidentification/invention (akin to hallucination), inflating the count from 2 to 3 and diluting accuracy. Minor phrasing/formatting diffs (e.g., no bolded titles like ground truth's "**Risk-based skip...**"; "passes if at least two" vs. "only when at least two... record 'Approve'") compound under strictness. ~6/10 equivalent.
- **Part (b)** (perfect): Exact match in list, order, naming, and count (9 items); no extras, hallucinations, or omissions.
- **Overall**: Strong on content fidelity for real elements (80%+ alignment), but strict penalty for substantive error in core task (decision identification) drops from 10. No policy violations or unrelated issues.
