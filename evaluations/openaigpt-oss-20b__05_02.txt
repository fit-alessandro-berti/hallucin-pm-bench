9.0

The LLM answer is nearly perfect:  
- **Diff format:** Correct, changes `<bpmn:userTask id="Task_CollectEquipment"` due date from `P5D` to `P2D` exactly as in ground truth; unified diff, one hunk.  
- **Rationale:** Correctly explains that shortening the due date reduces onboarding time and improves SLA compliance.

**Shortcoming:**  
- The rationale lacks the explicit mention of the **contractual 3-day SLA** and does not state _"without introducing any new activities"_, both present in the ground truth rationale and important for rigor.  
- LLM says "shortens the onboarding timeline" but does not clearly state that the cycle is now within the specific SLA period (3 days), which is a highly relevant justification.

**Grading:**  
- No technical error in the diff (full points).  
- Minor, but significant, loss for omitting specific reference to the SLA target in the rationale.

**Strict scoring:** 9.0
