The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5), demonstrating T5 firing before T3 via the upper path while preserving the P2 token. The explanation accurately describes the mechanism (enabling P5 without consuming P2 via T3) and stays under 120 words. Minor deductions for lacking explicit markings (M1–M5) and the confirmatory detail on T5 disabling T3 afterward, which add precision in the ground truth; format is slightly less structured. Overall, highly faithful but not identical in detail.
