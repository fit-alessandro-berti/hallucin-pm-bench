6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is structurally sound and covers the core elements (three decision points and all six documents), adhering mostly to exact terminology without introducing standard loan terms. However, under utmost strictness, several small but critical errors and omissions warrant a significant deduction (loss of ~3.5 points from a potential 10):

- **Decision Points (major deductions: -2.0 total)**:
  - Underwriter Alignment Gate: Omits the precise condition ("differ by ≤ 2 points"), vaguely stating "based on the difference." Misses contextual placement ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"). Uses "Decide whether" instead of ground truth's conditional phrasing. Minor: Adds bolding on underwriter names not in ground truth.
  - Amount Threshold Decision: Minor rephrasing ("proceed to" vs. "send to"); omits contextual placement ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
  - Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA): Adds "the loan" (unnecessary specificity) and specifies "(for amounts ≥ €15 000)" (redundant but not in ground truth). Uses lowercase "approve or reject" vs. ground truth's "**Approve** or **Reject**" with bold/capitalization. Misses exact phrasing "the board votes **Approve** or **Reject**."

- **Required Documents (moderate deductions: -1.0 total)**:
  - List is complete and mostly verbatim, but introduces small inaccuracies: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" adds "old" (ground truth: "≤ 3 months"); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" expands "single" and "or" beyond ground truth's abbreviated "pay-stub/tax slip"; "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds "template" (ground truth: "(CIS)"). Uses bolding throughout, inconsistent with ground truth's plain list.
  - Omits the closing note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), which reinforces the prompt's emphasis on non-standard process and exact terminology— a key instructional alignment missed.

- **Overall Structure/Formatting (-0.5)**: LLM uses numbered lists with bolding and introductory sentence, while ground truth uses headers (####), italicized conditions, and a more concise, process-flow-oriented style. No major hallucinations, but lack of exact mirroring reduces fidelity.

The answer is accurate in ~70% of details but falters on precision and completeness, justifying a mid-range score rather than higher.
