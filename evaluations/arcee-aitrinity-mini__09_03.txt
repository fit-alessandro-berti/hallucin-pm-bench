The LLM answer is highly accurate and faithful to the ground truth in substance: both correctly identify the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A (no rows, no timestamps), explicitly cover inability to compute average cycle time, std dev/dispersion, and CI for "Approve Invoice", and provide a precise, non-guessing explanation in one paragraph using only supplied info. No computations or external knowledge are attempted.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Slightly longer/more verbose than ground truth's concise style ("one short paragraph"), with elaborative phrasing (e.g., "no empirical data to analyze", "no duration can be calculated for any case").
- Unnecessary details like "cost_EUR" (not relevant to cycle time) and explicit SLA rejection (correct but absent in ground truth, adding ~20% extra content).
- Markdown bolding (** **) deviates slightly from "plain text" instruction (ground truth has none).
- Lacks ground truth's punchy "Impossible —" opener and "Additional raw log entries are required" closure.

No major errors; differences are stylistic/elaborative, not factual.
