**1.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Vocabulary Policy Violation (Major Deduction)**: LLM uses forbidden terms verbatim ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") despite **STRICT** mandate to use "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance" with exact capitalization. Ground truth uses mandated terms; LLM has zero compliance (-4.0 points).
- **Matrix Structure Violation (Major Deduction)**: Prompt specifies "activities as rows, **roles as columns**". LLM inverts this (RACI categories as columns, roles in cells). Ground truth correctly uses roles (full names: Account Manager, etc.) as columns with RACI letters in cells (-3.0 points).
- **RACI Allocations Incorrect**: Does not match ground truth (e.g., Receive Application: LLM AM R/A but with wrong columns/N/A; ground truth AM **R/A**, CO C, FC/IT I). Multiple mismatches per row; no "exactly one Responsible" consistency evident in wrong format (-1.5 points).
- **Unwarranted Content**: Introduces abbreviations (AM/CO), "N/A", and extraneous note "*Adhered...*". Ground truth has no extras, uses full role names, bolding for emphasis only (-0.5 points).
- **No Partial Credit**: Utmost strictness applied; even minor formatting (e.g., no bolding, wrong column headers) compounds failures. Total differences are comprehensive, warranting minimum score.
