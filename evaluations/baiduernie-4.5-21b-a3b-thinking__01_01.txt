### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Flaws, Significant Deduction)**: The LLM answer identifies 4 decision points but inaccurately classifies **Process_Refund_Payment** as a decision point, which is an execution step, not a branching decision (direct violation of process constraints; ground truth excludes this). It treats **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** and **Senior_Auditor_Review** as separate decisions without clearly linking them to the "final payment approval" as in ground truth, missing the integrated approval logic. The amount threshold (> €1,000) is implied via the Senior review but not explicitly summarized as a distinct branching decision point post-pre-approval, unlike ground truth's clear #2. Branching outcomes (e.g., rejection/return for ineligibility, skip auditor for low-value, process end on rejection) are underspecified or omitted, reducing precision. No table format, and the summary count (4) mismatches ground truth (3). These errors introduce conceptual differences, warranting a ~40% deduction from a perfect score.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Match, Minimal Deduction)**: The list is identical (7 documents, including conditional **AuditTrail**), with accurate descriptions and no introductions of undefined items. Minor deduction for inconsistent formatting (backticks vs. bold/numbering) and lack of ground truth's caveat phrasing ("only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue"), but this is cosmetic.

- **Overall Structure and Adherence**: Extra introductory text and summary section add verbosity without violating rules, but they deviate from ground truth's concise table/list format. No undefined activities/artifacts introduced, aligning with prompt constraints. Strict scoring reflects content differences: high fidelity on documents offsets but does not fully compensate for decision point inaccuracies.
