2.0

The LLM answer receives a 2.0. It correctly gives the answer "Non-compliant", but its justification is incorrect:

- It claims a violation of Rule 4 (Intern cannot directly follow CFO), but this is false: the Intern activity does not directly follow the CFO, as there is a System activity in between.
- The answer completely ignores that the actual rule violations are for Rule 2 (Risk_Assessment must come before Ship_Goods if Expedite_Flag is present, but occurs after) and Rule 3 (Three_way_match is not within 2 activities of Goods_Received).

Given that identification of which rules are violated is central to the task and the LLM missed both violations while misidentifying an incorrect violation, this answer deserves a very low score. The only redeeming point is that it provided the correct overall decision ("Non-compliant").
