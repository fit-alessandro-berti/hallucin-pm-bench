**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a short, evidence-based justification citing Case 1001 (correct reversal with timestamps) and Case 1002 (correct absence of Update_Inventory, disproving "always"). This suffices logically to refute the claim. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major difference (significant deduction):** Omits Case 1003 entirely, where Update_Inventory (line 11) precedes Authorize_Refund (line 14), providing another clear counterexample with reversed order. Ground truth covers *all* cases explicitly; missing one is a substantive incompleteness in data coverage for a "meticulous" analysis claiming to base "every statement strictly on the data."
- **Minor differences (further deductions):** Lacks ground truth's structure (e.g., "Short verdict," bullet points, line citations, explicit "in none of the three cases," "claimed ordering is reversed"); does not reiterate "immediately precede" or conclude "the statement is false." Justification is appropriately short but less comprehensive.

Score reflects correct core logic but penalizes incompleteness and stylistic/structural mismatches vs. ground truth (~30% deduction from 10.0).
