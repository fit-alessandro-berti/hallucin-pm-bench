The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and precision: both correctly identify the impossibility due to the redacted event log lacking rows and timestamps, explain the exact reason (no duration or time data for "Approve Invoice"), and limit the response to a single short paragraph without guessing or extraneous details. No differences or errors are present.
