**9.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable for R1–R6) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are accurate, concise (all ≤20 words), and factually correct, capturing key violations (e.g., dates for R3, pre-approval steps for R5, timing context for R2 via change-triggered approval). Minor deductions for: (1) lack of **bold markdown** on statuses and overall result as specified in prompt; (2) phrasing variations (e.g., R2 omits explicit "expedited"/dates/>2 days, focuses on "before approval" instead, though valid); (3) not identical wording across justifs despite semantic equivalence. No factual errors; format follows prompt structure closely despite ground truth table presentation.
