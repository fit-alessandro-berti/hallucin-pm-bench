3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This evaluation is based on a strict, point-by-point comparison to the ground truth answer, penalizing all deviations (structural, content, terminology, and completeness) with significant deductions for even minor inconsistencies, as per the instructions. The LLM answer shows some alignment in using mandated terms (e.g., "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and Markdown formatting, but it diverges substantially in structure, roles, task coverage, and RACI assignments, leading to a low score. Total possible: 10.0; deductions total -6.5.

#### Key Alignment (Partial Credit: +3.5 points)
- **Mandated Vocabulary**: Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst" exclusively for those elements (+1.0). No use of forbidden terms like "Customer Due Diligence" or "Compliance Officer".
- **Markdown Table**: Properly formatted as a Markdown table (+0.5).
- **Core Coverage of Source Text**: Attempts to map all informal steps (e.g., screening, approval, release, archiving, notification), with some task names close to ground truth (e.g., "Screen the payment against the sanctions list" ≈ "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Perform KYC Review" exact; "Approve high-risk transactions" similar) (+1.5). Includes IT Support role from source text (+0.5).

#### Major Deductions ( -6.5 points total)
- **Missing Role/Column (Severe Structural Error: -2.0)**: Omits the "Operations Manager" column entirely, which is present in every row of the ground truth. This breaks RACI completeness, as ground truth assigns accountability (A) heavily to this role across all tasks. The prompt allows roles from the source text (e.g., IT Support), but ground truth explicitly includes Operations Manager, making this a critical omission.
- **Incorrect Task Granularity and Coverage ( -1.5)**: 
  - Expands to 8 rows with arbitrary splits and additions not in ground truth or source (e.g., separates "Release the payment after approval" and "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" from step 5; adds "Notify Regulatory Liaison..." as row 8, which ground truth folds into "Archive Record" as "I" for Liaison without a separate row).
  - Omits or alters task names: e.g., "Receive customer’s transfer instruction and log it in the system" (verbose vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"); no direct match for "Archive Record" wording; extra "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" row not in ground truth (which implies it under "Release Payment" with IT "C").
  - Source text step 6 ("compliance officer is notified") is handled differently—LLM makes it a full row with unique R/A/C/I, while ground truth integrates as "I" in "Archive Record."
- **Inaccurate RACI Assignments ( -1.5)**: Assignments differ in nearly every row, ignoring ground truth's patterns (e.g., Operations Manager as "A" everywhere). Examples:
  - Row 1 (Receive): LLM has Analyst "R/A", Liaison "I", IT "I" → Ground truth: Analyst "R", Liaison "I", Ops "A", IT "C" (missing "A" and "C"; combines R/A incorrectly).
  - Row 2 (Screen): LLM Analyst "R/A", Liaison "C", IT "I" → Ground truth: Analyst "R", Liaison "A", Ops "I", IT "C" (wrong "C" for Liaison; missing Ops "I" and IT "C"; R/A combo deviates).
  - Row 3 (KYC): LLM Liaison "R/A", Analyst "C", IT "I" → Ground truth: Liaison "R", Ops "A", Analyst "C", IT "I" (close but missing Ops "A"; R/A combo).
  - Row 4 (Approve): Similar issues—LLM Liaison "R/A", Analyst "C", IT "I" vs. ground truth Liaison "R", Ops "A", etc.
  - Row 5 (Release): LLM Analyst "R/A", Liaison "C", IT "I" vs. ground truth Analyst "R", Ops "A", Liaison "I", IT "C" (wrong Liaison "C" vs. "I"; missing Ops; IT "I" vs. "C").
  - Rows 6-8: No equivalents in ground truth; e.g., LLM's "Archive" has Liaison "C" (wrong vs. ground truth "I"); notification row invented with Liaison "A" and IT "R" (unmatched).
  - Uses combined "**R / A**" notation inconsistently, while ground truth uses separate bolded singles per cell (e.g., "**R**" or "**A**").
- **Extra/Unauthorized Elements ( -0.5)**: Includes unnecessary "#" column and parenthetical "was..." explanations in headers (e.g., "Transaction Analyst (was “payment clerk”)"), which add non-mandated interpretive content not in ground truth or prompt. Violates "organise the RACI matrix clearly" by cluttering.
- **Missing Elements from Ground Truth ( -0.5)**: No "Legend" row explaining R/A/C/I (ground truth has it explicitly). No bolding on "**KYC Review**" task (as in ground truth). No post-table notes on vocabulary adherence or mapping (ground truth includes these for completeness). Task headers not prefixed with "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" style.

#### Overall Assessment
The LLM answer is a reasonable but flawed attempt to interpret the source text independently, adhering to vocabulary mandates but failing to match the ground truth's specific structure, role set, task consolidation, and assignments. With utmost strictness, the numerous deviations (especially the missing column and mismatched RACI logic) indicate poor fidelity, warranting a low-mid score. If the goal was exact replication, this would be closer to 1.0; partial credit for vocabulary and basic coverage prevents a total failure.
