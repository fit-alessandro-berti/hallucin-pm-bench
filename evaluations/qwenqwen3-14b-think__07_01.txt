7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the prompt's required categories and avoiding speculation. Headings match the prompt exactly, including the bullet-style notation.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Task listings omit names**: The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," which refers to the `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" for check_vip). The LLM lists only IDs, differing substantially from the ground truth's inclusion of full names with parenthetical IDs. This is a significant omission of explicit XML content, warranting a major deduction (~2 points).
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: LLM uses simple bullets (-), while ground truth employs asterisks (*) for items and bold (** ) for emphasis and versions (v1/v2). The gateway description is concise but lacks the ground truth's precise phrasing, bolding, and version labels, reducing descriptiveness (~0.5 points).
- **Minor additions in ground truth**: The ground truth includes a closing note ("No other differences..."), which the LLM omits, but this is not required by the prompt and thus a negligible difference.

Overall, the answer is functionally accurate but deviates in detail and adherence to XML name usage, preventing a higher score.
