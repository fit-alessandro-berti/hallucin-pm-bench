7.0

The LLM answer is largely accurate in identifying the core differences, but loses significant points for the following strict issues:

- The "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" are listed only by their IDs, not with the full element name as in the ground truth: it lacks the full element name and id pair (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = check_vip)"). This omission is non-trivial given the prompt's emphasis on using the element names exactly as they appear in the XML.
- In the "Gateway type changes" section, while the change is correctly identified, it doesn't maintain the explicit bold formatting of the gateway type names as in the ground truth (e.g., **exclusiveGateway** to **inclusiveGateway**), although this is a smaller infraction.

Otherwise, no extra or missing changes are reported, and the categories/headings are all present.

Given the requirement for utmost strictness and penalizing even small format or information errors, these issues warrant a 3-point deduction, so 7.0.
