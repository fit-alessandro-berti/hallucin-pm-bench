The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the proper order, matching the core content of the ground truth without extraneous information about other processes. However, it loses points for minor but noticeable differences in presentation: lack of descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), use of "and" instead of the parallel symbol "‖", absence of code formatting (backticks), and omission of the concluding sentence affirming no other parallel tasks—small stylistic variances that, under strict evaluation criteria, warrant a deduction despite the substantive accuracy.
