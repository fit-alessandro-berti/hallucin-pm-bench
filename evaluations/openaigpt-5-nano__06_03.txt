The LLM answer correctly identified both sets of parallel tasks in Process B and presented them in the precise order they appear, exactly as in the ground truth. However, it did not explicitly label the sets as "first parallel block" and "second parallel block," nor did it include any concise statement clarifying that no other tasks can be run in parallel, as given at the end of the ground truth. These missing minor clarifications, while not adding substantive content, represent a very slight loss in completeness and alignment with the expected format. Thus, a small deduction is warranted.
