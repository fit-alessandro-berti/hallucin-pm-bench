The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, structure, and fidelity to the log data, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. Question 1 is identical. Question 2 matches the calculation and rounded percentage precisely. Question 3 is semantically equivalent, listing the correct case. Question 4 provides two clear, accurate reasons that align directly with "small sample size" and "temporal bias" from the ground truth options, without introducing extraneous details.
