### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiency, ~20% Alignment)**: The LLM answer identifies only 1 decision point (the explicit high-value threshold after Finance_Controller_PreApprove), which partially matches Ground Truth #2. It completely omits Ground Truth #1 (eligibility check in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility, which is implicitly a decision based on checking manifests and reports) and #3 (final approval/rejection in Finance_Controller_PreApprove and/or Senior_Auditor_Review, required before payment per constraints). Labeling it as the "one explicit" point ignores the prompt's call for *every* decision point, including implicit ones evident in the process flow (e.g., validation implies eligible/not, sign-off implies approve/reject). This is a critical omission under strict evaluation, resulting in substantial point loss for incompleteness and failure to infer from the described activities/checks.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Alignment, ~90% Match)**: The LLM lists all 7 documents from the process (RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF), matching the Ground Truth catalogue exactly. It correctly contextualizes AuditTrail as high-value only (aligning with the note) and adds minor accurate details like "signed" for BankTransferAuthorization (directly from description, not an introduction of new info). Structure by activity adds value without introducing undefined artefacts, and the exclusion note reinforces adherence. Minor deduction for not using a flat "complete list" format identical to Ground Truth, but this is stylistic.

- **Overall Adherence to Prompt/Process (Moderate)**: No introduction of undefined activities (e.g., no "CustomerService_Agent_Decide") or artefacts, which is positive. However, the response over-relies on explicitness for decisions, missing the comprehensive summarization required, and uses extraneous formatting (emojis, checkmarks) that doesn't detract but doesn't enhance fidelity. Strict penalty for partial coverage of core task (decisions), pulling the score down despite solid documents section. Small errors (e.g., not explicitly noting rejection outcomes) compound the loss.
