### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is mostly accurate and comprehensive but incurs point deductions for the following reasons under strict criteria:

- **Decision Points (major deductions, -2.0 total)**:
  - Identifies the correct number (3) and core elements (eligibility validation, pre-approval, high-value threshold), aligning well with the process description.
  - However, it omits explicit rejection outcomes: for eligibility (ground truth specifies "*Not eligible* → claim rejected/returned"), pre-approval, and senior auditor review (ground truth includes a combined "*Final payment approval*" with "*Rejected* → process ends without payment"). The LLM implies progression only on success but does not detail failure branches, which is a key part of summarizing "every decision point" and branching logic. This is a significant incompleteness.
  - Structural differences: The LLM treats **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** as a standalone decision point (accurate, as it involves signing off), while the ground truth folds pre-approval and senior review into a single "final payment approval" point. The high-value check is correctly placed but labeled "implicit," which is unnecessary and slightly deviates from the ground truth's direct framing after pre-approval. These mismatches in granularity and phrasing reduce precision.

- **Required Documents (minor deduction, -0.5 total)**:
  - Lists all 7 documents identically and correctly, including the conditional note for *AuditTrail* (matches ground truth's "only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue").
  - No introductions of undefined elements, adhering to the prompt.
  - Minor issue: Lacks the ground truth's explicit closing note ("No other documents or legacy activities..."), which reinforces completeness, but this is not a critical error.

Overall, the answer is strong in coverage and fidelity to the process but loses points for incomplete branching outcomes (a core requirement for decision summaries) and slight interpretive differences in point structure. No criminal or off-topic issues; fully on-prompt.
