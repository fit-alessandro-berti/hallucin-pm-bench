The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false with "No" and provides a precise, one-paragraph justification citing the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order) as the ground truth, accurately proving the "always" claim fails. It matches the required format and cites lines/case-IDs without errors or fabrications. The only minor deviation is the inclusion of confirmatory details on positive cases (C001, C002, C004), which is factually accurate but adds unnecessary verbosity not present in the more concise ground truth; under utmost strictness, this slight expansion warrants a small deduction from perfection.
