4.5

The LLM answer identifies the correct three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) and grounds the selection in joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, aligning with the ground truth (GT). Quantification of SLA exceeds is present but uses percentages (e.g., 50% for Legal Approval) instead of absolute seconds (e.g., +300 s in GT), introducing a stylistic mismatch that deviates from GT's direct data presentation; this is a moderate error as it alters clarity without invention. Waiting times are included accurately in both, with LLM adding calculated percentages (e.g., 67% waiting), which are data-derived but not in GT, slightly inflating description beyond strict grounding.

However, significant deductions for: (1) Format and structure differences—LLM uses a bolded "MEMORANDUM" header with "RE:" while GT uses italicized "To:/From:/Subject:"; "From:" mismatches (Senior Process-Performance Analyst vs. Process Performance Office). (2) Opening lacks GT's total cases reference (4,805, derived but absent in LLM). (3) Recommendations are entirely different and less aligned: LLM's are data-tied (e.g., referencing specific times/cases) but generic (e.g., "parallel review" vs. GT's "rule-based pre-checks"); GT's include invented specifics (e.g., "€25k", "one risk analyst") not in the prompt data, but LLM fails to match even the conceptual actions. (4) No closing projection in LLM (e.g., GT's 35% cycle time reduction). (5) Word count ≈190 vs. GT's ≈120, exceeding ≈150 guideline.

These differences in core elements (recommendations, format, ancillary details) warrant strict penalty, though core identification and data grounding prevent a lower score.
