5.5

### Explanation
The LLM answer captures the core elements of the process but introduces notable deviations from the ground truth, warranting a mid-range score under strict evaluation. Key issues include:

- **Decision points (major discrepancies, -3.0 points)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 decision points in a clear, tabular structure with precise branching logic (e.g., explicit "Not eligible → claim rejected/returned" in #1; combined "Final payment approval" in #3 covering rejection after pre-approve/auditor). The LLM lists 4 points, over-expands by treating "Process_Refund_Payment" as a separate "Payment readiness gate" decision (not a branching decision in the process description, but a prerequisite constraint—introduces unnecessary interpretation). It omits explicit rejection outcomes for triage (#1) and bundles/misplaces rejection logic in #2 and #4, diluting accuracy. The high-value branch (#3 in LLM) aligns with ground truth #2, but overall structure and count mismatch reduce fidelity.

- **Required documents (strong match, +1.0 from base)**: Lists all 7 documents identically, including the conditional note for AuditTrail. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's explicit disclaimer ("No other documents or legacy activities..."), which reinforces adherence to the prompt's "Do not introduce..." rule.

- **Overall adherence and style (minor issues, -0.5 points)**: Faithful to the process description without fabricating activities/artefacts (e.g., no mention of legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide"). However, bullet-point format vs. ground truth's table feels less structured, and phrasing like "move toward payment (subject to...)" introduces vague qualifiers not in the ground truth. No hallucinations, but strictness penalizes incomplete outcome specificity (e.g., no clear "process ends without payment" equivalent).

Base score starts at 10.0 for perfect match; deductions reflect content differences (not just format), emphasizing the prompt's focus on precise summarization without additions.
