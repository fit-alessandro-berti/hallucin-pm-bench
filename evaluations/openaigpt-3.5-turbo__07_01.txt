### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring):
- **Added tasks (partial credit, ~4/10)**: Correctly identifies the two added tasks by *name* ("Check Customer VIP Status", "Generate RMA QR Code"), matching XML `name` attributes exactly. However, fails to include `id` attributes (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`) as ground truth does (and implied by "element names exactly as in XML"). Adds extraneous "Task:" prefix not in XML or ground truth. Bullet formatting uses `-` instead of `*`.
- **Removed tasks (0/10)**: Completely incorrect—reports "(none)" but ground truth correctly identifies "Send RMA Label (id = `send_rma_label`)", which is present in v1 XML but absent in v2. This is a factual XML diff error.
- **Gateway type changes (partial credit, ~5/10)**: Detects correct change (exclusive to inclusive for `gw_valid`). However, uses display `name="Warranty Valid?"` instead of `id="gw_valid"`; capitalizes "ExclusiveGateway"/"InclusiveGateway" (XML uses lowercase "exclusiveGateway"/"inclusiveGateway"); lacks "(v1)" "(v2)" specificity; phrasing not exact.
- **Formatting/Structure (-2 overall)**: Headings use "###" instead of exact "• Added tasks" etc.; no final note "(No other differences...)".
- **Overall**: Major factual omission (removal) dominates; minor inexactitudes compound under "utmost strictness". Total reflects ~30% alignment.
