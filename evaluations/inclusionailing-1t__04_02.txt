4.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies compliance for R1, R3, R4, and R6 with appropriate justifications (minor wording variations do not detract significantly). The overall conclusion of NON-COMPLIANT is accurate. However, major errors undermine the score: R5 is incorrectly marked Compliant with flawed reasoning, ignoring that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occur after Change_Request but before the new Manager_Approval, violating the rule (status and justification both wrong). For R2, the status is correctly Violated, but the justification is incorrectâ€”it references the initial Finance_Approval (03-04) as the last, overlooking the new Manager_Approval (03-07) required post-Change_Request, making Ship_Goods (03-05) occur before the final approval rather than within 2 days after it. These are substantive errors in two rules, central to the analysis, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria.
