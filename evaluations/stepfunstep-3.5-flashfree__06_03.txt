The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, numbers them in order (1 and 2), uses bold formatting for task names (similar to ground truth's emphasis), and stays focused solely on Process B with no extraneous information about A or C. It accurately conveys parallelism via "and" paired with explicit branch references.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Stylistic differences: "and" instead of ‖ symbol (-0.2); parenthetical "(branches of Parallel Split #1)" vs. "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**" (-0.3); introductory sentence not in ground truth (-0.2); lacks closing "No other tasks..." sentence (-0.1).

No factual errors; highly faithful to ground truth content under strict evaluation.
