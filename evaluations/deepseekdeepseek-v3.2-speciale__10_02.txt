**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in nearly every aspect, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Structure and columns**: Missing "Operations Manager" column (present in ground truth). Headers differ ("Activity" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)").
- **Rows/tasks**: 8 rows vs. 6, with non-matching names (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; extras like "Send SWIFT message", "Notify Regulatory Liaison"; omissions/rephrasings like no "Screen Against Sanctions List" exact match, "Conduct KYC Review (sender and beneficiary)" vs. "**KYC Review**"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record").
- **RACI assignments**: No row matches exactly; all differ (e.g., Receive: LLM Analyst R/A vs. ground Analyst **R**/Liaison I/Ops **A**/IT C; Screen: LLM Analyst R/A vs. Analyst **R**/Liaison **A**/Ops I/IT C; KYC: partial overlap on Liaison R/A but others mismatch; Release: LLM Analyst R/Liaison A vs. Analyst **R**/Liaison I/Ops **A**/IT C).
- **Formatting**: No bolding on R/A, no **Legend**, uses "–" inconsistently vs. explicit R/A/C/I; numbered rows vs. clean list.
- **Coverage/omissions**: Splits/expands source steps inaccurately relative to ground truth (e.g., adds unmerged "Send SWIFT", explicit "Notify"); does not map precisely without "substitutions" as per ground truth note.

Even minor phrasing variances (e.g., "payment" vs. "Payment", "high‑risk" hyphen) compound errors. Total mismatch in content, assignments, and presentation.
