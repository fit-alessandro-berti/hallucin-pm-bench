9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, using all required activity names and correct terminology. The sequence of decision points and the branching logic are correct and comprehensive, though the LLM added slightly more explanation, e.g., indicating steps (“Step 5,” “Step 7,” etc.), which is not strictly required, but does not introduce any error.

The list of required documents matches the ground truth exactly, with correct names and brief clarifying notes in parentheses. The closing line (“No other documents are used or permitted per Acme’s May 2025 protocol”) is functionally equivalent to the ground truth’s note.

Minor issues:
- In “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” the LLM inserted “template,” which is slightly extra compared to “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” in the ground truth (very minor difference).
- “Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)” is worded more verbosely than the ground truth’s “pay-stub/tax slip” but does not introduce ambiguity.
- The phrase "advance to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" could more precisely mirror "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval," though the intent and terminology align.
- A small loss for not numbering the decision points as in ground truth.

None of these issues constitute major errors but in strict grading, even minor language or format deviations cost points.

**Hence, 9.0.**
