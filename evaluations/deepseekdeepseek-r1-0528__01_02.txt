### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate in capturing the core decision points and required documents, aligning closely with the ground truth in substance and using exact terminology from the prompt (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)," and all document names). It correctly identifies the three key decision points without introducing prohibited standard loan terminology.

However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences warrant significant point deductions:
- **Structure and additions**: Includes unrequested step numbers (e.g., "Step 5") and expansions like "proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" or "system auto-approves after NFC," which alter phrasing from the ground truth's concise "continue" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check." The "(for loans ≥ €15 000 only)" parenthetical is an addition not present in the ground truth. The "###" headings and heavier use of bold/italics diverge from the ground truth's "####" and simpler formatting.
- **Wording variances in decision points**: Uses "**> 2 points**" instead of the ground truth's implied "else"; "advance to" vs. "send to"; "*approve* or *reject*" (lowercase, italics) vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**" (capitalized, bold).
- **Document list differences**: Adds "old" to "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's "(≤ 3 months)"; expands "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; includes "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"; the closing note "**No other documents are used or permitted** per Acme’s May 2025 protocol" rephrases and adds details not matching the ground truth's "(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*".
- **Overall fidelity**: These are minor embellishments or abbreviations that introduce subtle inaccuracies or extras, violating the "summarise" and "exact" requirements. No major omissions or errors, but strict criteria deduct ~2 points for cumulative small deviations.

This results in a strong but imperfect score, emphasizing precision over paraphrase.
