9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: three added tasks, one removed task, and two gateway type changes, exactly matching the ground truth content. Formatting deviations are minor—extra Markdown headers (##), unnecessary backticks around IDs (not present in ground truth or strictly required beyond the instructional example), and lack of alignment spaces on the second gateway line—but do not alter verifiability or introduce errors. Under utmost strictness, these small inconsistencies warrant a 1.0 deduction from perfection.
