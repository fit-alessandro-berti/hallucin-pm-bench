### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Correctness of Answer**: The LLM correctly answers "No", matching the ground truth. It accurately identifies the counterexamples (C002 and C004) with precise intervening activities and timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim. No factual errors in the cited sequences.
- **Justification Quality**: The justification cites relevant CaseIDs (C002, C004) and activity sequences as required, using clear, evidence-based explanations. This is sufficient to refute the FACT without extraneous information, aligning with the task's focus on "relevant" evidence.
- **Differences from Ground Truth**: 
  - The LLM omits analysis of compliant cases (C001, C003), which the ground truth includes in a comprehensive case-by-case table for full transparency. This makes the LLM's response less exhaustive, though not incorrect—disproving "always" only requires counterexamples.
  - No table format or explicit quantification ("two out of four"), reducing structural similarity and thoroughness.
  - Minor: Slightly less formal phrasing (e.g., "disproven by" vs. ground truth's "violate the stated rule"), but this does not affect accuracy.
- **Strictness Applied**: Under utmost strictness, the incompleteness (missing compliant cases and table) warrants a deduction, as the ground truth sets a high bar for comprehensive verification. However, the core logic and evidence are nearly identical, so no major penalty beyond that. Small omissions reflect a 1-point loss from a perfect 10.
