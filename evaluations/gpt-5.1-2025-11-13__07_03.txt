8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (10/10)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: three added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), one removed task (Task_ManualReview), and two gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel; Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel). No extras, omissions, guesses, or commentary—fully matches the ground truth on verifiable differences.
- **Formatting Strictness Deductions (-2.0 total)**:
  - Headings: LLM prefixes each with "-" (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS"), while ground truth uses verbatim plain text (e.g., "ADDED TASKS"). This violates the "verbatim" instruction for headings, a small but consistent error across all three (-0.5 per heading, total -1.5).
  - List Items: LLM lists items as plain lines without the "-" bullet prefix used in ground truth for all six items (3 added, 1 removed, 2 gateways). Prompt does not explicitly require bullets, but ground truth sets the reference format; deviation is a minor inconsistency (-0.5 total).
  - Minor: Ground truth aligns the second gateway with extra spaces ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"); LLM lacks them, matching the prompt's example more closely but differing from reference (-0.0, negligible as it's not a content error).
- Overall: Excellent on substance, but strict adherence to ground truth formatting is required; small structural mismatches justify the deduction for a high-but-not-perfect score.
