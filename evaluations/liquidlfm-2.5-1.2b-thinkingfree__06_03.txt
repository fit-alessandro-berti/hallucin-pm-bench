9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt and process description. It adheres strictly to the user instructions by focusing solely on Process B, numbering the sets sequentially, and providing no extraneous information about other processes.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting differences** (significant deduction): Lacks the ground truth's bolded descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), backticks around task names, explicit parallel symbol (‖), and structured phrasing. Uses simple comma separation instead, which is semantically equivalent but not identical.
- **Missing confirmatory statement**: Omits "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel.", reducing completeness relative to ground truth despite not being explicitly required by the prompt.
- No factual errors, extras, or omissions in core content.

These presentation and minor completeness differences warrant a deduction from 10.0, but the semantic accuracy is near-perfect.
