7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth (3). Full points.
- **Q2**: Exact match to ground truth sequence, including order and separators. Full points.
- **Q3**: Partial matchâ€”correctly identifies and lists "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" in alphabetical order, with one-per-line formatting. However, includes a fabricated extra item ("Ship_Order"), which is a hallucination (no instance where "Ship_Order" immediately precedes itself). Under strict criteria, this extra erroneous element deducts significantly, treating it as a major factual inaccuracy despite the partial correctness.
