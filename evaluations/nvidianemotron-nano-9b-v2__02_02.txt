7.0

Q1: Correct — 3 distinct cases, matches ground truth.

Q2: Correct — Sequence for C002 exactly matches ground truth.

Q3: Partially correct — "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" are correct. However, "Ship_Order" is incorrectly listed as a preceding activity. In the provided log, "Ship_Order" never immediately precedes another "Ship_Order", so this is an extraneous, hallucinated answer.

Strictly speaking, per the instruction to penalize even small errors significantly, Q3 should receive a substantial point deduction for the extra, false activity. Since Q1 and Q2 are perfect but Q3 is only two-thirds right (2 correct out of 3 listed, but the third is invented), the overall answer is solid but impaired by the Q3 hallucination.

Thus: 7.0
