The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1 and 2 (numeric values and rounding). For question 3, it adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, explicitly references the single occurrence (low support: 1 event, 1 case), addresses variance/instability (skewing metrics via rarity/inflating variability/averages; overfitting to outlier), and cautions against over-generalization (misleading if assuming representativeness; poor accuracy/distortion on broader data). No inventions or deviations from the log; covers all required elements without errors.
