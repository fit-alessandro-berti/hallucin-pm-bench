8.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Factual accuracy (full credit)**: Correctly identifies exactly the added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway change (`gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`). No extra or missing items, no speculation. Matches prompt's required categories perfectly.
- **Headings (full credit)**: Exact match to prompt's specified format ("• Added tasks", etc.), including bullets. Ground truth uses different formatting (**bold** without bullets), so LLM is superior here.
- **Task listings (significant deduction -2.0)**: Uses only raw IDs (e.g., "check_vip"), while ground truth provides full descriptive names from XML (`name` attribute) as primary identifier with ID in parentheses (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`*)"). Prompt's "element names exactly as they appear" is ambiguous (id vs. name attribute), but ground truth's approach is more complete/readable; LLM's minimalism deviates in detail level.
- **Gateway description (minor deduction -0.5)**: Concise ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway") vs. ground truth's verbose ("`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"). Lacks explicit v1/v2 reference and formatting (backticks, bold).
- **List formatting/style (minor deduction -0.5)**: Plain indented lines vs. ground truth's bulleted `*` lists with code formatting and parentheses. Small but visible difference.
- **Extra content (full credit)**: No extraneous note like ground truth's "(No other differences should be reported.)"; adheres to "only" instruction.
- **Overall strictness**: Semantic match is excellent (10/10 facts), but presentation/detail differences vs. ground truth warrant deductions per "utmost strictness" and "small errors significant loss." No criminal/off-policy issues.
