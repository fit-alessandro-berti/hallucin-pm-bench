The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly stating that the value cannot be derived/computed, emphasizing the absence of timestamps/durations, and explaining the impossibility of calculation without fabricating data. It directly addresses both parts of the prompt (no average provided, with reasoning on why no calculation is possible). Minor deductions for added extras not in the ground truth (e.g., counting occurrences, specific duration interpretation examples, and an offer to assist with future data), which introduce slight verbosity and deviation from the concise structure, though they remain accurate and non-contradictory.
