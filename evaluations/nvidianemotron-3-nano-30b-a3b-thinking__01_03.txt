**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a) – Decision points (40% weight)**: LLM identifies 3 points vs. ground truth's exact 2. Correctly captures the risk-skip rule (minor phrasing diffs: "skip" vs. "bypass"; acceptable) and TriVote (close: "any two sign-offs granted" vs. "at least two record 'Approve'"; -0.3). **Major error**: Fabricates a 3rd "decision point" at Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome itself, which is not a gate/branch (just produces input for the actual conditional; -2.5). Over-strict deduction for invention/misinterpretation. Partial: 6.8/10.
- **Part (b) – Documents (60% weight)**: LLM lists only 5 vs. ground truth's 9, in partial order. Hits Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025 (+2.0). **Critical misses** (-4.0 total): Omits all 3 Scorecards (explicit "Inputs" in step 3, first appear before Deck Memo). Fails to list "Signed Offer Sheet 77" separately (distinct requirement in step 8, post-unsigning in step 7). Wrong order/granularity (e.g., ID Matrix as #4 ignores signed offer precedence in step 8; combines signed/unsigned). No hallucinations (good), but incompleteness is severe. Partial: 3.0/10.
- **Overall**: Significant deviations (incomplete list, extra invented point) outweigh partial matches; strict policy demands heavy penalty for misses/errors. No formatting/style issues. Total weighted: (6.8*0.4) + (3.0*0.6) = 4.52 → rounded down to 4.2 for strictness.
