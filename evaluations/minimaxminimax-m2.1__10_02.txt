**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance**: Perfect match (uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst” exclusively where applicable). No deductions here (+1.0 base).
- **Roles**: Major mismatch. LLM uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support (3 roles). Ground truth includes Operations Manager (4 roles). Missing role = critical omission (-2.0).
- **Tasks coverage/mapping**: LLM invents 8 tasks (splits source steps, adds "Notify Regulatory Liaison upon completion"). Ground truth has exactly 6 concise mappings from source without additions/omissions. Extra tasks and rewordings (e.g., "Receive and log customer's transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; separate "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" absent in GT; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record") = significant deviation (-2.0).
- **RACI assignments**: No task matches ground truth exactly. Examples:
  | Task (approx.) | LLM | Ground Truth | Diff |
  |----------------|-----|--------------|------|
  | Receive | TA:R | TA:R, RL:I, Ops:A, IT:C | Partial (missing others) |
  | Screen | TA:R, RL:C | TA:R, RL:A, Ops:I, IT:C | Wrong RL (C vs A), extras |
  | KYC Review | RL:R | TA:C, RL:R, Ops:A, IT:I | Missing others |
  | Approve | TA:A, RL:R | TA:C, RL:R, Ops:A, IT:I | Wrong TA (A vs C), extras |
  | Release | TA:R, RL:I | TA:R, RL:I, Ops:A, IT:C | Partial, extras |
  | Archive | IT:R, RL:I | TA:C, RL:I, Ops:A, IT:R | Partial, extras |
  - Fabricated entries (e.g., TA A for Approve – unsupported by source; RL C for Screen – invented). Every row differs substantially (-3.0).
- **Structure/Format**: Markdown table present, but bloated with unprompted extras (# title, ## Process Overview, ## Role Definitions, ## Responsibility Mapping Summary – ~50% non-table content). Ground truth is lean table + legend + minimal note. Prompt specifies *only* "create a RACI table... Put the table in Markdown" and "organise the RACI matrix clearly" (-1.0).
- **Fidelity to source/prompt**: Covers steps but distorts (e.g., TA accountable for Regulatory Liaison's approval; unnecessary Consulted/Informed). No bolding/legend matching GT style. Strictness applied: cumulative mismatches >> minor errors.

**Total: 2.0** (Minimal credit for table format, vocab, partial task coverage; heavy penalties for all other divergences).
