### Evaluation
The LLM answer is nearly correct, matching the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 (all values are accurate and properly formatted). However, under strict evaluation, Q5 contains a significant error: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list. This activity does appear as the first event in case C-77, so it should be excluded. The list has an extraneous item, introducing a factual inaccuracy that violates the prompt's instruction to use only facts directly from the log. This merits a 2-point deduction from a perfect 10.0 score, as small errors (misinterpreting case starts) must result in notable point loss per the guidelines. The JSON structure remains valid, which prevents further penalties.
