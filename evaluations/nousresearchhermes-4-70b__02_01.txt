8.0

The LLM answer is almost perfectly correct, matching the ground truth on Q1-Q4 and only making a single error for Q5: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as an activity that never appears as the first event of any case, whereas in the event log it indeed does appear as the first event of case C-77.

- Q1: Correct (3)
- Q2: Correct ("Pack_Items")
- Q3: Correct ("2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00")
- Q4: Correct (2)
- Q5: Incorrect (added "Quality_Check" which DOES appear as a first event)

Given the absolute strictness requested, even a single error (especially in an enumeration question) should result in a significant deduction, thus the score is a solid 8.0 out of 10.0.
