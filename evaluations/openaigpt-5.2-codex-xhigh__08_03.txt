**9.2**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in substance, correctly identifying "yes" with the same core shortest prefix sequence (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5, length 4) to fire T5 without prior T3 firing, matching the lower bound and query requirement for **shortest** sequence proving the possibility. Marking trace is equivalent (explicit states after each transition, pc=0 confirming no T3). Explanation captures the key shortcut bypass of pc/T3.

Minor differences (strictly penalized but small impact):
- Sequence presented as concise length-4 list (correctly shortest per query/ground truth's own lower bound) vs. ground truth's extended 6-step numbered list with continuation (T6, T3 unnecessary for proof, as query requires only T5 before T3, not both firing).
- Lacks ground truth's extra "Why this works" bullets on feedback/T6/T3 post-firing (unneeded) and final 6-step 〈...〉 notation.
- Slightly less verbose justification but equivalently proves shortness (T1 + path to pd/pe).

No factual errors; LLM is actually more precise/concise on shortness vs. ground truth's inconsistent "minimal" claim for length-6. High score reflects semantic match despite format/verbosity diffs.
