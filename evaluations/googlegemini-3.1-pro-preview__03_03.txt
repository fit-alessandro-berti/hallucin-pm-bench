**9.2**

The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth and correctly implements the prompt's requirements, including all explicitly mentioned flow elements (e.g., the "**checks warranty eligibility**" task omitted in ground truth), verbatim task names (better matching prompt casing/tense than ground truth's capitalized infinitive forms), required gateways, exactly two end events, and "wrc_" ID prefix. Minor deductions for: 
- Slight name variations on gateways/starts/ends (e.g., "Warranty active?" vs "Within warranty?", "online warranty claim" vs "Online warranty claim submitted", "end" vs descriptive—both invented but prompt doesn't specify verbatim).
- Descriptive flow names (verbatim from prompt text, e.g., "out of warranty", vs ground's generic "Yes"/"No").
- Verbose structure (incoming/outgoing attributes + separate flows: valid BPMN).
- Inclusion of DI for full diagram visualization (prompt requests "BPMN 2.0 XML diagram"; enhances self-contained nature without hallucinating flow logic).
- isExecutable="true" and process name (minor, not prohibited).

No deductions for extra/hallucinated flow elements (all from prompt; ground truth omits required "checks warranty eligibility" task and flows, making LLM more complete). Different IDs/ whitespace/structure allowed per rubric. Utmost strictness applied to small name/flow-name variances (-0.5), DI/process attrs (-0.3).
