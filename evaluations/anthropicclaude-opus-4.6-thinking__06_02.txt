The LLM answer is identical to the ground truth in content, structure, task names, order, numbering, and comma-separated format with appropriate spaces after commas. No deviations, extraneous text, or omissions detected, even under strict whitespace scrutiny (trailing spaces in ground truth appear to be formatting artifacts and do not alter equivalence).
