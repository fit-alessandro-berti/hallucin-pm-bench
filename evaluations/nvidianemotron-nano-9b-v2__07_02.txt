6.0

**Evaluation:**

- **Added tasks:**  
  The LLM's answer correctly identifies the three added tasks. **No deduction here.**

- **Removed tasks:**  
  The LLM claims that "Task_ApproveLoan (Approve Loan)" was removed.  
  *This is incorrect*: in v2, "Task_ApproveLoan" appears, albeit with a different name ("Auto-Approve Loan"), but task IDs are preserved and cosmetic renamings are to be ignored as per instructions.  
  So, **only "Task_RejectLoan"** (Reject Loan) is genuinely removed.  
  **Major error: Incorrectly claims an existing task was removed.**

- **Gateway-type changes:**  
  Correctly notes the gateway changed from Exclusive to Inclusive.  
  (Minor cosmetic error: doesn't specify that this is XORâ†’OR or source/target version explicitly, but the meaning is clear.)

**Deduction rationale:**  
- **Major deduction** for claiming an existing task as removed.
- Otherwise, the answer format is correct and the other changes are accurately captured.
- The grouping/formatting and the content otherwise meet requirements.

**Final Score:** 6.0
