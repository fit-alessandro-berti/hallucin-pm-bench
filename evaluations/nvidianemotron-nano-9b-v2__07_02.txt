4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (8/10)**: Correctly identifies all three added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject) with accurate IDs and names. Minor deductions for format differences (bullets vs. numbered list, no bolding or backticks) and not specifying "No other additions" explicitly, but content is precise. Strict policy requires format adherence for full points.
- **Removed tasks (0/10)**: Major error—incorrectly lists "Task_ApproveLoan (Approve Loan)" as removed, despite the instruction to ignore cosmetic renamings. The ID persists in v2 with only a name change ("Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan"), so it is not removed. Only "Task_RejectLoan (Reject Loan)" is correctly removed. This is a substantive misunderstanding of the prompt, warranting zero points for the section.
- **Gateway-type changes (7/10)**: Accurately notes the change from ExclusiveGateway to InclusiveGateway for "Gateway_Decision". Deductions for lacking detail on XOR/OR semantics, version references (v1/v2), and explicit "No other changes" note; format is concise but misses ground truth's structure (numbered, bolded).

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average (equal sections): (8 + 0 + 7)/3 ≈ 5, adjusted down to 4.0 for the critical error in removed tasks violating core instructions (strictness amplifies impact of misidentifying changes, as it inflates differences from ground truth by ~50% in that section). No other changes (e.g., flows, event renamings) were hallucinated, but the renaming oversight is disqualifying under utmost strictness.
