**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and directly fulfills the task requirements with no factual errors, omissions, or deviations from the log evidence. It correctly identifies "No", cites the exact violating CaseIDs (C002, C004) with precise sequences, notes the compliant cases (C001, C003), and explains why "always" fails. The ground truth provides equivalent information in table format for visual clarity, but the content matches precisely—no differences in analysis, citations, or conclusion warrant any deduction, even under strict evaluation.
