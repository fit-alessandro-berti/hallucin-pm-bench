7.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (exact count)**: Perfect match (both state "1"). +5.0 points.
- **Part 2**: Strong on small sample (3 cases, ~1.5h span) and label variation (cites exact examples). Word count compliant (~105 words). However, significant deductions for:
  - Missing quantitative precision: No mention of 14 events, "<2 hours", frequency volatility (0% to 7% swing), confidence intervals, or "rare events sampling error" – core to ground truth's statistical rigor. (-1.5)
  - Mild speculation ("If manual fraud checks are also logged under multiple names"; "confused with Manual Review") beyond data, diluting focus vs. ground truth's strict "strict/fuzzy matching distortion". (-0.8)
  - Less emphasis on needing "larger/random slice" for reliability. (-0.5)
  
Total: High fidelity but lacks ground truth's depth/strictness, justifying 7.2 (not 10 due to "utmost strictness" on differences).
