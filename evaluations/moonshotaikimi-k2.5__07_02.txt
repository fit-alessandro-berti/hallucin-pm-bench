**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core content accuracy (high marks base ~9.0)**: Correctly identifies all 3 added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), 1 removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway change (exclusive → inclusive). No misses, inventions, or failures to ignore cosmetics (e.g., name changes like "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name).
- **Significant deductions for deviations (-1.8 total)**:
  - **Extra interpretive phrasing (-0.8)**: "replaces the former reject task" (in Added) and "superseded by Final Reject" (in Removed) incorrectly imply modification/replacement, blurring pure add/remove categories. Ground truth treats as distinct (new ID = added; old ID = removed). Violates strict add/remove separation.
  - **Unnecessary positional/descriptive details (-0.6)**: Adds "inserted between Start and Review Application", "new branch ... for 'missing docs'", "enabling multiple outgoing ... simultaneously" – not in ground truth; exceeds minimal summary.
  - **Formatting/structure mismatches (-0.2)**: Uses bullet points vs. ground truth's numbered lists; retains full prompt heading "(e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)" vs. trimmed; "id: `...`" vs. plain `` `...` ``; no closing note "(No other ...)".
  - **Gateway phrasing (-0.2)**: Uses XML tags (`exclusiveGateway` → `inclusiveGateway`) vs. ground truth's semantic BPMN terms (**exclusive** (XOR) → **inclusive** (OR)); extra explanation.
- **Strictness applied**: Even accurate extras/phrasing count as differences per instructions; small stylistic mismatches amplify loss. Not a verbatim match, so capped below 8.0.
