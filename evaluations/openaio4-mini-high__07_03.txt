8.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, listing all the correct changes with accurate ids and names/type transitions. However, it deviates from the strict format demanded by the prompt and visible in the ground truth:

- List formatting: The ground truth uses a dash "-" before each item, while the LLM answer does not.
- Gateway type changes column alignment: The ground truth indents the change for Gateway_Payment for alignment; the LLM does not.
- For gateways, the ground truth includes a space after the colon and aligns the name changes, which the LLM omits.
- The LLM answer omits parentheses around task names in the listing itself, but correctly provides them in the name field (so this is not a point of loss).
- The LLM does not repeat the instruction headings verbatim, but in this case, the error on dashes and alignment is the most visible deviation.

Given the requirement for utmost strictness and that even small errors must result in meaningful point loss, the issues above are significant enough to warrant a 2-point deduction. Thus, score: **8.0**.
