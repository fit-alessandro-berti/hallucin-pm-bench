The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer; removed: Task_ManualReview; gateway changes: both ReviewNeeded and Payment from exclusive to parallel), matching the ground truth content verbatim. However, it omits the bullet points (-) used in the ground truth for all sections, and lacks the alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (e.g., no leading spaces before "Gateway_Payment"). These formatting differences, while minor, deviate from the ground truth structure and warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
