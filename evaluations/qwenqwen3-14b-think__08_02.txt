### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM correctly answers Q1 ("Yes") and provides the exact minimal firing sequence as the ground truth (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), demonstrating T5 firing before T3. This aligns well with the core requirements.

However, under strict evaluation:
- The explanation contains a significant error: "T3 ... would later fire if P2 remains unmarked" is factually incorrect and misleading. P2 must be marked for T3 to fire; after T5, P2 is consumed (unmarked), disabling T3 entirely, as the ground truth notes. This inverts the logic and contradicts the sequence's outcome.
- The explanation lacks the ground truth's marking details (e.g., M1 to M5) and explicit confirmation of T3's disablement, reducing precision and completeness.
- Word count (115) complies, but the flawed phrasing warrants a notable deduction for accuracy in a technical context.

Overall, strong on sequence and intent, but errors in explanation justify ~2.5-point loss from a perfect 10.
