**Score: 8.0**

**Rationale:**
- **Correctness:** The LLM answer correctly concluded "Yes" to Q1, and provided a correct minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3.
- **Conciseness/Adequacy:** The explanation gives a mostly accurate reasoning: that after the given sequence, T5 can fire before T3, and that T5 consumes P2, after which T3 is disabled.
- **Deviations:**
    - The LLM answer could have made the dependency/blocking relation clearer: it says "T3 (P2→P4) would later fire if P2 remains unmarked," which is a bit imprecise. After T5, P2 is gone, so T3 cannot fire. The ground truth specifies this explicitly: "Because T5 consumes the token in P2, T3 is subsequently disabled, confirming that T5 can indeed precede T3…"
    - Some minor imprecision: "T3 would later fire if P2 remains unmarked" is less clear/rigorous than the ground truth.
    - The explanation could be a bit more precise about the marking after each transition (as the ground truth provides), further justifying why T3 is, in fact, forever disabled after T5.
- **Minor issues:** The last part of the explanation could mislead someone into thinking T3 might be enabled later, when in fact it’s now impossible given the net's structure.

**Summary:** The answer is essentially correct, but small losses for not being maximally explicit about the irrevocable disabling of T3 after T5, and for not using the marking-by-marking justification given in the ground truth.
