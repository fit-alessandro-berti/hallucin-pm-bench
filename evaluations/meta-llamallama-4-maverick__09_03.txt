9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the requested metrics cannot be computed due to the absence of concrete event data and timestamps in Artefact A. It clearly and explicitly states that both the average cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval cannot be determined for the same reason, aligning with the ground truth.

However, there is a minor issue: the LLM repeats itself across the three points, making the explanation slightly redundant compared to the concise, strictly factual tone of the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM uses the phrase “cannot be done due to the lack of actual data in the event-log stub” instead of directly stating, as in the ground truth, that "the necessary data are absent.” This introduces an extra, small interpretive step. Also, the LLM’s reference to “not guess or draw on outside knowledge” is a reflection of prompt instructions rather than strictly about the data at hand.

These are minor stylistic and precision downgrades, but content-wise, the answer is correct and suffices. Hence, a 1-point deduction for stylistic and ultra-conciseness differences yields a score of 9.0.
