**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part a**: Complete failure (0/10). Ground truth identifies exactly **2 decision points** (the risk-skip conditional and TriVote gate) with precise one-sentence rules. LLM invents 8 non-decision steps as "decision points" (e.g., Receive-Application, Assign-Deck-Reviewer), entirely misses the risk-skip rule (step 4 conditional), mangles TriVote ("two prior approvals" vs. "any two of three"), and adds irrelevant details. No accuracy.
- **Part b**: Total miss (0/10). Ground truth lists exactly **9 documents** in first-appearance order, including the 3 scorecards (inputs to Tri-Color-Risk-Check). LLM omits all 3 scorecards, duplicates/invents non-documents (e.g., "Tri-Color-Risk-Check Scorecard," "Tri-Color-Risk-Rating," "Preparation of Ownership/Confidentiality Agreements"), hallucinates KYC/AML (explicitly forbidden), and misorders/rephrases (e.g., treats Signed Offer Sheet 77 as separate invention).
- **Overall**: Massive hallucinations, structural errors, and zero fidelity to process description. No partial credit under "utmost strictness"—even minor issues deduct heavily; this is wholesale inaccuracy.
