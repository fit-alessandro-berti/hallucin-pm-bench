The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in Process B and numbers them in order, matching the core content of the ground truth. However, it loses points for formatting differences (comma separation instead of the more precise ‖ symbol to denote parallelism, lack of bolded descriptive labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**", and absence of backticks around task names) and omission of the closing sentence ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel"), which explicitly confirms the scope. These are small but multiple presentational and completeness errors under strict evaluation, warranting a moderate deduction from a perfect match.
