The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks in the correct order and does not mention processes A or C, which complies with the instructions. The sets are properly grouped and each parallel block (split) is reflected by separate list items. However, the answer lacks explicit labeling about the "first/second parallel block", and does not specify that "no other tasks in Process B can run in parallel" as the ground truth does. These omissions, while minor, reflect a lack of completeness compared to the ground truth, warranting a notable (but not drastic) point deduction.
