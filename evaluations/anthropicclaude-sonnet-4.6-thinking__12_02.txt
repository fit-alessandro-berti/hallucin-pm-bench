**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in structure (bold "No" followed by justification citing the exact same counterexamples: C003 lines 6/7 and C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), accuracy (correctly disproves "always follows" via precedence and absence), and completeness (one-paragraph format per prompt). Minor stylistic additions (e.g., timestamps, interpretive phrases like "the opposite of what the claim asserts" or "nothing for it to 'follow'") are precise, non-contradictory enhancements that align perfectly with the log and do not introduce errors, deviations, or omissions. No differences warrant point deduction under strict evaluation.
