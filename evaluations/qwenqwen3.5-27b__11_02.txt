### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall: it correctly identifies the same three activities as the ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), structures a concise memo (≈140 words <200), bases explanations strictly on table metrics (e.g., wait times, throughput drops, rework, SLA breaches, processing time, stdev), and provides one concrete, data-driven action per activity tied to specific issues (e.g., automation for rework, checklists for variance).

**Strengths (aligning closely with GT):**
- Same activity ranking/selection, justified by multi-metric bottlenecks (wait, rework, throughput, SLA).
- Factual accuracy on most metrics (e.g., Request_Documents: 150 min wait, 22% rework, 190 throughput; Review_Documents: 25 min process, 9 min stdev, 12.4% SLA).
- Professional memo format with clear list and summary.

**Strict Deductions (significant for small errors per instructions):**
- **Factual error (-1.0):** For Initial_Assessment, claims "second-highest wait (18 min)" – incorrect; Review_Documents has 30 min (true second-highest after Request_Documents' 150 min). This misreads the table.
- **Less precise explanations (-0.3):** Omits Review_Documents' 30 min wait (cited in GT); Initial_Assessment throughput (270, high) not contrasted vs. downstream drops.
- **Actions vaguer/less quantifiable (-0.3):** E.g., LLM's "automate document triggers" vs. GT's "automatic...validation to...halve rework"; no projections or multi-metric ties like GT's "cut queueing and halve rework."
- **Minor stylistic diffs (-0.2):** No bolded metrics or end-to-end impact projection (GT adds ≈10% throughput lift, >40% SLA reduction – interpretive but data-implied).

High fidelity (85%+ match), but strict policy demands deduction for verifiable table misread and reduced precision.
