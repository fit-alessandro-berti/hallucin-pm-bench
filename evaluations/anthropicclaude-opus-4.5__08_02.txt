The LLM answer is factually correct, matches the "Yes" for Q1, provides the identical minimal firing sequence, and offers a clear step-by-step explanation with accurate markings demonstrating T5 firing before T3. It adheres to the ≤120-word limit (~85 words).

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Extra "## Analysis" header not in ground truth.
- Slightly different structure (explanation after Q2 vs. split; sequence as inline code vs. numbered list with inline M_i markings).
- Minor formatting variances (e.g., no spaces in markings {P2,P3} vs. { P2, P3 }; no explicit "T3 has not yet occurred" or "subsequently disabled" phrasing).

Utmost strictness applied, but core content is equivalently precise and complete.
