9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core correctness (high match, +9.0 base)**: Both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed and explain due to missing timestamps/elapsed times/durations. LLM phrasing aligns closely with system instruction ("cannot be derived").
- **Structural match (minor deduction, -0.3)**: LLM uses numbered 1)/2) matching user query format; ground truth is a single blockquote paragraph. Not identical structure.
- **Content fidelity (minor deductions, -0.5 total)**:
  - LLM adds accurate but extraneous detail on benchmarks (different segment, no value for "Review Contract")—not in ground truth, creating unnecessary difference.
  - LLM specifies "start and end times for individual occurrences"—precise but slightly more interpretive than ground truth's "no temporal value per event."
  - Ground truth mentions "ordering information" (arguably present in log sequence); LLM avoids this, correctly focusing on times—slight edge to LLM, but still a phrasing variance.
- **Conciseness and wording (minor deduction, -0.2)**: LLM is slightly longer/more verbose; words like "impossible" vs. ground truth's "no cycle-time calculation is possible" and "fabricated" are near-synonyms but not identical. No factual errors, but strict diff-based scoring penalizes variances.
- **No major errors**: No fabrication, no use of unavailable data. Overall ~92% semantic/lexical overlap, justifying 9.2 under utmost strictness.
