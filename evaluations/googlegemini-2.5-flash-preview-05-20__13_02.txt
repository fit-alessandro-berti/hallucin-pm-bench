**9.5**

1. The answer for occurrence count is fully correct: 1.
2. Percentages: Both (2.08% and 8.33%) are calculated correctly.
3. The explanation is well-worded, hits all required points: mentions the low frequency, risk of skewing performance metrics, and that generalizing would misrepresent true process behavior. There is ample caution about instability and unrepresentative sampling. The only extremely minor issue is that, while the answer touches on unpredictability/skew without directly using words like “variance” or “instability,” it covers the logical consequence thoroughly.

There are no fact errors. The only possible deduction is for not explicitly using statistical terms like "variance" or "instability" or "confidence interval," which were modeled in the sample answer, but the LLM's explanation is clear and analytically solid.

Thus, this answer rates 9.5/10.
