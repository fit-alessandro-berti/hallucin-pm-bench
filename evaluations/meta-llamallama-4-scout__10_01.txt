6.0

**Justification:**

- **Terminology**: The LLM answer uses the correct *mandated synonyms* (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”), with no mention of forbidden terms. Full marks for terminology.
- **Structure**: Presents a clear RACI table with correct orientation (activities as rows, roles as columns). The legend is helpful but not required.

**Major Errors (point deductions):**

1. **Incorrect RACI Assignments** *(Significant errors, -3 pts)*:
   - The allocation of R/A/C/I per activity is *mostly incorrect* and often incomplete compared to ground truth:
     - **Receive Application**: Only "R" under Account Manager, when ground truth has "R/A" and also shows other roles as "C" or "I".
     - **KYC Review**: Only "R" under Compliance Officer, ignoring that Account Manager is "A", and other roles are "C"/"I".
     - **Order Vetting**: Only "R" under Account Manager, missing that AM is "R/A", CO is "C", others are "I".
     - **Payment Clearance**: Only "R" under Finance Clerk, missing that FC is "R", AM is "A", CO is "C", IT is "I".
     - **Record Update**: Only "R" under IT; missing others' "C/I".
     - **Notify Customer**: Only "A" for AM, missing that AM is "R/A", others are "I".
   - *Responsible* and *Accountable* roles are not consistently or correctly assigned; consultation and information flows (C/I) are almost entirely omitted.

2. **Loss of Specificity in Assignment** *(Medium error, -1 pt)*:
   - The answer does not distinguish between activities where AM is both R/A, AM is only A, or any dual responsibilities as per ground truth.
   - For nearly every activity except KYC Review, the complexity of shared or supporting responsibility is omitted.

3. **Inaccurate Notes** *(Minor error, -0.5 pt)*:
   - The descriptive notes are oversimplified and sometimes misleading, e.g., suggesting AM is only accountable ("A") for "Notify Customer" (in reality, AM is both R/A).

4. **Formatting** *(Minor, no point):*
   - The formatting is adequate, though a more detailed legend does not compensate for missing "C" and "I" assignments.

**Summary**:  
- **Strengths:** Vocabulary rules are strictly followed; required alternate terms are present and correct. No forbidden terms. Structure is basically correct.
- **Weaknesses:** The RACI allocations ignore nearly all "C" (Consulted) and "I" (Informed) assignments and muddle accountability, which is the most critical aspect of a RACI matrix. Some roles miss their responsibilities entirely.

Thus, a *strict* assessment yields a score of **6.0**. The critical information mapped to each activity/role is missing or incomplete, though vocabulary and structure are correct.
