2.0

The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without forbidden variants, which aligns with the ground truth and rubric on correctness for vocabulary. However, the RACI matrix is severely incomplete and inaccurate compared to the ground truth:

- It omits nearly all Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments across all activities, leaving most cells blank instead of populating them as in the ground truth (e.g., no C for Compliance Officer in Receive Application; no A for Account Manager in KYC Review; no I for multiple roles in every row).
- It fails to reflect the full narrative implications for accountability and involvement, assigning only partial Responsible (R) roles in most cases and incorrectly using A (instead of R/A) for Notify Customer.
- Each ground truth activity has exactly one R and fuller cross-role participation; the LLM version has one entry per row but misses the "exactly one R" nuance in places and ignores broader RACI structure.
- Unwarranted content includes an added legend (not in ground truth) and explanatory notes that restate the matrix without adding value, introducing extra elements.
- Structural differences: Expanded column headers with abbreviations (e.g., Account Manager (AM)) and bolding inconsistencies (e.g., no bolding on key terms like ground truth's **KYC Review**).

These are major deviations, not minor errors, resulting in a matrix that only superficially matches ~25% of the ground truth content (primarily the core R assignments and terminology). Strict evaluation demands near-exact fidelity, so the score reflects minimal partial credit for vocabulary and basic structure.
