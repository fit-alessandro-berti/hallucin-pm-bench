The LLM answer correctly identifies that the value cannot be determined and provides a concise reason tied to missing data, aligning closely with the ground truth's core explanation (absence of timestamps/durations for computing intervals). Minor deductions for brevity: it omits explicit mention of "timestamps," "event counts only," and "start-to-completion intervals," making it slightly less precise under utmost strictness, though still fully accurate and responsive to the prompt's call for a single concise sentence.
