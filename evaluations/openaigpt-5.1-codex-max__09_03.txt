The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in substance, structure (one short paragraph explaining precisely why computation is impossible), and key details: redacted rows/timestamps in Artefact A, absence of start/complete times preventing duration calculations for "Approve Invoice", and explicit coverage of all three metrics (average cycle time, std dev, CI). Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., "I cannot compute... because" vs. "Impossible —"; no mention of "dispersion" phrasing or suggestion of "additional raw log entries," though neither is required or erroneous per task).
