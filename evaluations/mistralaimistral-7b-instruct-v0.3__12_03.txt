**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correct elements (+ points)**: Answer "No" matches ground truth (essential for partial credit). Correctly identifies counterexamples in **C002** (Pack_Items intervenes) and **C004** (Check_Fraud intervenes), providing relevant CaseIDs and sequences for these.
- **Major errors (- significant points, per strictness rule)**:
  - **Factual inaccuracy in C001**: Claims "Pack_Items" between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, but log shows Validate_Payment (09:15) *immediately after* Receive_Order (09:12), *before* Pack_Items (10:00). This misrepresents a compliant case as a violation.
  - **Factual inaccuracy in C003**: Claims "Ship_Order" between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, but log shows Validate_Payment (09:44) *immediately after* Receive_Order (09:40), *before* Ship_Order (11:00). Another compliant case wrongly labeled.
  - **Overgeneralization**: States "In all four cases, there are other activities...before Validate_Payment," which is false (C001/C003 comply). Ground truth precisely notes *two violations*, not four.
- **Structural/Completeness differences**: Lacks ground truth's case-by-case table, immediacy checks (✅/❌), and explicit "always" logic (2/4 violations). Justification cites sequences but with errors, reducing fidelity.
- **Overall**: Correct conclusion by accident (via valid C002/C004 cites), but ~50% of justification is factually wrong, violating "rely **only** on evidence" and "citing...sequences." Small errors would deduct notably; these are large, capping score mid-low.
