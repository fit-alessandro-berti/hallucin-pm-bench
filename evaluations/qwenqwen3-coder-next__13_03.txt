**7.2**

### Rationale (strict evaluation):
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: Exact count "1" confirmed with precise row evidence. No errors. (10/10)
- **Q2 (major partial credit, but significant deviations)**: 
  - Shares small sample (3 cases/1 day) and near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing distortion via conflation/fuzzy matching. (+4.5)
  - Misses core ground truth emphases: tiny scale quantified (14 events/<2 hours), frequency swing (0% to 7%), wide confidence interval, rare-event sampling error as primary driver. (-1.5)
  - Introduces ungrounded specifics: "overestimate" directionality (GT neutral on direction), "naming conventions", "case-type distributions/high-risk", "temporal patterns" (speculative, not data-derived). (-1.3)
  - Under 120 words, structured well, but emphasis shift (conflation > sampling variance) reduces fidelity. (7.0/10 overall for Q2 → blended score 8.6/10? No, strict weighting penalizes omissions heavily.)

Total reflects ~70% content/emphasis overlap; small omissions (e.g., no 14 events or %) and additions cost dearly per instructions.
