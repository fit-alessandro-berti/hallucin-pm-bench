9.0

The LLM answer lists both correct pairs, in correct alphabetical order within each pair, and in correct overall order, matching the prompt. However, the LLM fails to pad the spaces in the second pair as in the ground truth ("Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" instead of "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"), which, if strict formatting is required, constitutes a small error. There is also an omission of putting pairs within code block formatting as in the ground truth.

Given "utmost strictness" and the importance of even small formatting errors, a full point is deducted for these mistakes despite the correct content.

Final score: 9.0
