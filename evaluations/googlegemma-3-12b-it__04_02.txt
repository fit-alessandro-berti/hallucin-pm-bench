3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Incorrect status (Violated vs. Compliant) and justification (ignores initial sequence of approvals). Major error (-2.0 points).
- **R2**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification (fails to account for post-change approval timing). Major error (-2.0 points).
- **R3**: Correct status and justification matches closely. No deduction.
- **R4**: Correct status and justification matches. No deduction.
- **R5**: Correct status but incorrect justification (claims no new approval obtained, ignoring the late one after processing steps). Moderate error (-1.0 point).
- **R6**: Correct status and justification matches. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but format is informal (no table, though not strictly required). Starting from 10.0, deductions total -5.0 for errors; strictness amplifies impact of status mismatches.
