4.0

Rationale for scoring:

- **R1**: The LLM answer incorrectly marks R1 as Violated, stating approvals were not in sequence. In fact, they were in the correct order before Change_Request (Manager_Approval, then Finance_Approval); the violation in the case is *not* R1, but R5. This is a significant misunderstanding of the requirement, which leads to a -2.5 penalty.

- **R2**: The LLM answer says Compliant, but it is actually Violated. Because the Change_Request AFTER approvals required a new Manager_Approval *before any further processing* (R5), and Ship_Goods happened before this new Manager_Approval, so for purposes of R2, the Ship_Goods did not occur within 2 days of the "last required approval." Major reasoning error, -2 points.

- **R3**: Correctly identified as Violated and justification is accurate. Good.

- **R4**: Correctly Not Applicable; justification matches.

- **R5**: Partially correct—identifies a violation, but the justification says “no new Manager Approval was obtained,” when in fact there was a late Manager_Approval after subsequent processing steps (thus, it mostly captures the essence, but misses the detail that the new approval happened *after* unauthorized steps). Partial credit, -0.5.

- **R6**: Correctly identified as Compliant.

- **Overall Result**: Matches.

- **Other issues**: LLM answer did not use the tabular format or clearly separate rules, though the format is acceptable per prompt.

**Summary**: The LLM got the overall result and some rules correct, but made critical errors on R1 and R2, and was imprecise in its explanation for R5. Significant differences with ground truth. Thus, a strict score of 4.0 is justified.
