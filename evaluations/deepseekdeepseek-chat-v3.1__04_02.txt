The LLM answer has correct statuses for R1, R2, R3, R4, and R6, but incorrectly marks R5 as Compliant (should be Violated) due to failing to recognize that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice are further processing steps before the new Manager_Approval, violating the rule. Additionally, R2's justification is factually erroneous (Ship_Goods on 03-05 is within 1 day of Finance_Approval on 03-04, not more than 2 days; the violation stems from the post-change approval on 03-07, which the LLM misses). These are major conceptual and factual errors affecting rule interactions, warranting significant deduction despite overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion. Minor formatting alignment with prompt, but content differences are substantial under strict criteria.
