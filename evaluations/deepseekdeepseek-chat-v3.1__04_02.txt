4.0

**Evaluation:**

- **R1:** LLM correct ("Compliant").
- **R2:** LLM says "Violated" but justification is incorrect. It references the time since the original Finance_Approval, but per R5, a new approval is needed after Change_Request, so the 2-day window restarts. Also, Ship_Goods occurred before the new Manager_Approval and should not have occurred at all; main violation here is that it happened too early, not that it was too late.—Partial understanding only.
- **R3:** Correct ("Violated"), clear justification.
- **R4:** Correct ("Not Applicable").
- **R5:** Marked as "Compliant" (INCORRECT). The ground truth shows this is Violated because a Change_Request happened after all approvals but Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice ensued before a new Manager_Approval. This is a major error.
- **R6:** Correct.

**Key errors:**
- R2 justification shows misunderstanding of timing and interaction with R5—penalty.
- R5 is marked as Compliant instead of Violated—major penalty.

**Formatting:** Slightly verbose but within style.

**Conclusion:** The LLM gets 3 out of 6 rules correct (R1, R3, R4, R6), but it fails R5 in both judgment and explanation, and R2's justification is flawed and overlooks R5's interaction with R2. These are significant errors in a compliance/auditing context.

**Hence, under strict marking, the answer is a 4.0.**
