### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Functional correctness (high weight)**: Both implement the exact same improvement (interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` routing to existing `Activity_AMReview`), correctly using no new activities, enforcing ~48h SLA via escalation. Perfect match here (+10 base).
- **XML structure & validity differences (major deductions)**:
  - Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<bpmn:timeDuration>`: Ground truth includes it (matching original XML's style with `conditionExpression`); omission is a schema compliance error (-1.0).
  - Different element IDs (`Boundary_SLA_CreateAccount_48h`/`Flow_09` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`/`Flow_LateEscalation`) and `name` ("SLA 48h exceeded" vs. "48h breach"): Functionally irrelevant but literal differences (-0.3).
  - No matching comments (e.g., `<!-- ❶ -->`) or formatting flair (-0.2).
- **Justification (minor deductions)**: One sentence both; semantically near-identical, but LLM's wording varies slightly (e.g., "automatically escalates overdue executions... clear escalation path" vs. GT's "routing the timeout... without introducing any new activities"), missing explicit task echo (-0.0, as equivalent).
- **Overall strictness**: 90% match, but small XML error (xsi:type) warrants significant deduction per instructions; no other violations (e.g., no full model repeat, precise to task). Timer placement approximates SLA timing correctly (instant flows post-VerifyID).
