The LLM answer is accurate and concise. It correctly identifies the absence of timestamp data and clearly explains that only activity counts are available, which prevents calculation of cycle time. However, the wording is slightly less explicit than the ground truth in mentioning the necessity of â€œstart-to-completion intervals," and could more strongly emphasize that this specific information is required to compute durations. This minor lack of specificity results in a small deduction.
