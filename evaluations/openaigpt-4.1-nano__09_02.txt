The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of calculating the average cycle time due to the absence of timestamp data, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning. However, it loses a full point for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., omitting explicit mention of "duration information" and "start-to-completion intervals") and minor differences in wording and structure, which introduce small but noticeable deviations under strict evaluation criteria.
