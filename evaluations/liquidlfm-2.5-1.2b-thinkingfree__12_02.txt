**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it outputs **"Yes"** instead of the required **"No"**, directly contradicting the ground truth. Its justification is entirely flawed, misinterpreting the log by ignoring case boundaries (e.g., claiming Line 6 "post Receive_Order at 10:43 after Line 5", but Line 5 is C002 while Line 6/7 are C003 where Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order; it also completely overlooks C005's counterexample). No credit for partial correct observations (e.g., C001), as the claim requires "always" with zero exceptions, and the response fabricates compliance where none exists. Under utmost strictness, this total failure on binary verdict, citation accuracy, and logical reasoning warrants the minimum score.
