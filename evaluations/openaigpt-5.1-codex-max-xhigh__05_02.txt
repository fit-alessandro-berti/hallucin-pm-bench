The LLM answer perfectly matches the critical diff change (identical lines modified, single hunk format), adheres strictly to rules (only attribute modification, no add/delete/reverse), and provides a one-sentence rationale with equivalent intent (tightening the longest dueDate to meet SLA), but loses 0.5 points for minor wording deviations from ground truth (e.g., "Compressed ... five to two ... downstream delays ... onboarding SLA" vs. exact phrasing "**Collect Equipment** ... 5 ... **2** ... 3-day SLA ... no new activities"; no bolding; no explicit cycle time or rule-reaffirmation) under utmost strictness.
