6.0

The LLM answer proposes lowering the `camunda:dueDate` of **Sign Contract** from 3 days to 1 day, while the ground truth expects lowering **Collect Equipment** from 5 days to 2 days. Here is the strict evaluation breakdown:

- **Correctness of Target:**  
  - The LLM picked a different task (`Sign Contract`) than the one expected (`Collect Equipment`). This is a significant divergence.

- **Rule Compliance:**  
  - The LLM correctly made exactly one allowed change (modifying an attribute, not adding/removing elements).

- **Diff Format:**  
  - The diff format and one-sentence rationale conform to instructions.

- **Rationale:**  
  - The rationale is sound and process-architecture relevant, though not the approach specified in ground truth.

- **Process Impact:**  
  - Reducing the cycle time through an earlier task would speed up the process, but setting "Sign Contract" to P1D may not be as feasible as reducing "Collect Equipment" to P2D (as per the ground truth's concern for realistic compliance).

- **Small errors:**  
  - The LLM did not select the change that meets the specific SLA as referenced in the ground truth justification, and missed the precise target and metric (from 5 to 2 days).

**Result:**  
- Major deviation in selecting the task and attribute value leads to a significant point loss.
- Correct change format and rationale prevent a very low grade.

**Final strict score: 6.0**
