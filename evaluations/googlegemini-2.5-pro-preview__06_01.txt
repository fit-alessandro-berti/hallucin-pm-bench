The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel, and outputs them, but fails to follow the required output format with respect to spacing and alignment:

- The ground truth uses strict spacing/alignment (two spaces before/after the "â€”" and aligns tasks), while the LLM answer does not.
- The LLM does not surround the output with triple backticks as in the ground truth, nor does it strictly copy the format within those backticks.
- The prompt asks for results "in **alphabetical order**, both *within* each pair and in your overall list." While the pairs themselves are listed in alphabetical order, each pair is not strictly alphabetized internally by padding or spacing.
- There is a preamble ("Okay, I will list...") that was not requested and is absent from the ground truth output.

These formatting deviations constitute significant errors per the "utmost strictness" instruction and should reflect as a substantial deduction. The content (the correct pairs) is accurate, but the output format is non-compliant. Half points.
