4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer partially addresses the prompt but has significant deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points Summary (Major Partial Credit, but Inaccurate Structure and Omissions)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points with clear branching logic (eligibility rejection, amount threshold as a separate post-preapproval check, and final approval/rejection leading to payment or end). The LLM correctly identifies three points tied to key activities (triage, preapproval, auditor review) and notes the high-value branch (> €1,000), but it:
  - Fails to explicitly summarize the eligibility decision's rejection outcome ("Not eligible → claim rejected/returned").
  - Does not treat the "Amount threshold" as a distinct decision point after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** (per ground truth #2); instead, it embeds it implicitly in the auditor step, diluting the branching logic.
  - Attributes the final approval/rejection too narrowly to the auditor (or preapproval), without unifying it across both as in ground truth #3, and omits clear outcomes like "process ends without payment."
  This results in a less precise, table-like summary of branching, losing ~2-3 points for incomplete fidelity.

- **List of All Required Documents (Severe Omission, Major Deduction)**: The prompt requires a complete list of *all* required documents without introducing extras. The ground truth provides a exhaustive, numbered catalogue of 7 documents (including conditional ones like **AuditTrail**) in a dedicated section, explicitly noting no legacy elements. The LLM:
  - Only lists documents per decision point (5 in total: **RefundRequestForm**, **FlightManifest**, **WeatherReport**, **EligibilityChecklist**, **AuditTrail**), omitting **BankTransferAuthorization** (required for **Process_Refund_Payment**) and **RefundConfirmationPDF** (for **Issue_Confirmation_Letter**)—critical artefacts from steps 5-6.
  - Structures this as "required documents for each" decision, not a standalone "complete list," which fragments the response and fails the prompt's directive.
  - Introduces vague "Information derived from..." phrases, which border on non-defined artefacts (though not severely).
  This is a fundamental gap (missing ~30% of documents), costing ~3-4 points.

- **Overall Compliance and Fidelity**: No introduced activities/artefacts (positive), and the response stays on-topic without extras like the non-existent "CustomerService_Agent_Decide." However, the integrated/per-step format lacks the ground truth's clear separation (table for decisions + bulleted list for documents), making it harder to parse. Small errors (e.g., imprecise decision phrasing, no rejection paths) compound under strictness, but partial coverage of early process elements prevents a floor score.

A perfect match would score 10.0; this is ~40% aligned, hence 4.0.
