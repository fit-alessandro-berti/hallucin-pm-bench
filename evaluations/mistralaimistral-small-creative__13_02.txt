**9.8**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect. Questions 1 and 2 (a/b) are **exactly** correct: count (1), percentages (2.08%, 8.33%) match ground truth precisely, including calculations and rounding.

For 3 (≤100 words, ~92): Fully compliant. Mentions single-occurrence ("1/12 cases"). Notes variance/instability indirectly but effectively ("outlier or noise", "overlook its significance", "fail to detect deviations", "without sufficient data" implying high variance/unreliability). Cautions over-generalization ("if generalized", "trained on this slice", "risk being dismissed"). Explanation is process-mining relevant (metrics, conformance), concise, data-only. Minor deduction (-0.2) for not explicitly listing stats examples (e.g., "mean cycle time") or "confidence intervals" as in sample, per strictness on wording alignment.
