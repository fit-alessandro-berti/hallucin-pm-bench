The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth answer, listing the same sets of tasks that can execute concurrently, and in the correct order. It omits other process information and provides the required numbering and clear distinction of parallel tasks. However, there is a slight loss of fidelity in not labeling them as "first parallel block" and "second parallel block" â€” which is minor, but per strict grading, a 0.2 point deduction applies. Otherwise, all substantial requirements are perfectly met.
