6.2

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM answer over-elaborates the first decision point, giving a step for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as if it were a gate, rather than concisely summarizing the skip/bypass as a single decision ("Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"). The decision is not "assign risk" but "based on the risk and amount result, skip or not."  
- The LLM splits this into two decision points—the risk rating assignment (not a genuine 'gate') and the conditional skip (which is the real branch).  
- The "TriVote" gate is correctly characterized: "at least two out of three approvers."  
- Both decision points in the ground truth are ultimately present, but the LLM's answer is more verbose, with redundant decision points (the actual 'risk check' is not a gate; the skip/bypass is the gate).  
- Therefore, there’s a minor loss of points for conceptual imprecision and redundancy.

**b) Required documents**

- The LLM omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" in the document list; this is a significant error, as the signed offer sheet is explicitly required in Step 8 according to the process.
- The LLM merges the three scorecards ("Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow") into a single line, instead of listing them as distinct documents in the order requested.
- "ID Matrix Declaration" appears in the correct place.
- The rest of the documents are listed in correct order.
- Minor loss for collapsing the three scorecards into one, and major loss for omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77."

**Other issues**

- KYC/AML/credit bureau: The LLM answer avoids hallucinating these, which is correct.
- Some minor wording/format differences (e.g., short document names), which are not critical.

**Summary**

- Decision points: Redundant/incorrect splitting of steps, but both key gates covered.
- Documents: Omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (major error), and combining separate scorecards into a single line (minor error).
- No hallucinations or egregious inaccuracies.

Given the strict grading required, these errors cause substantial point loss, especially in the document section. Therefore, the answer is clearly *not passable as fully correct*, but above average for containing all major factual content.

**Final score: 6.2**
