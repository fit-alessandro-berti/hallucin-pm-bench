4.0

### Evaluation Explanation
The LLM answer demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the process but contains multiple inaccuracies and omissions when strictly compared to the ground truth, warranting a low score under the utmost strictness criterion. Even minor deviations (e.g., grouping distinct items or adding unsubstantiated elements) result in significant point deductions, as they alter the precision and completeness required.

#### Part a) Decision Points
- The ground truth identifies exactly **two** decision points: (1) the risk-based skip condition after Step 3 (combining the check and conditional branch), and (2) the TriVote gate.
- The LLM incorrectly introduces **three** decision points by treating Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) as a standalone "decision point" that "determines" skipping Step 5. This is a hallucination/misinterpretation—Step 3 only generates an outcome (risk rating); the actual decision/branch is the conditional rule in Step 4. This adds an extraneous element not present in the process or ground truth, directly contradicting the requirement to summarize "every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch)."
- The LLM's description of the Step 4 condition is mostly accurate but lacks the ground truth's precise phrasing (e.g., no emphasis on "Low or Medium *and* ≤ €250 000" as a single integrated rule post-check).
- The TriVote description is close but omits the ground truth's exact wording ("record 'Approve.'"), opting for a looser paraphrase ("approve it"), which introduces slight ambiguity.
- Overall for a): Incomplete and inflated list (extra point) reduces fidelity; deduct ~4 points from a potential 5 (half of total evaluation).

#### Part b) Required Documents
- The ground truth lists **nine** distinct documents/items in strict first-appearance order, separating the three scorecards (as individual inputs) and treating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate entry from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" (reflecting the process's explicit mention in Step 8).
- The LLM lists only **six** items, committing errors:
  - Groups "Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow" into **one** bullet (position 2), despite them being three separate documents that first appear individually in Step 3 inputs. This violates "list **all** documents" and order of first appearance, compressing three into one.
  - Lists "Offer Sheet 77" correctly (position 4, first in Step 7) but fails to include "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a **separate** entry (it only mentions "signed Offer Sheet 77" parenthetically in the description for position 5, without numbering it). This omits a explicitly named document from Step 8.
  - "ID Matrix Declaration" is correctly placed but tied to the unsigned offer in description, indirectly compounding the signed version error.
  - Other items (Form 14B, Deck Memo, Loan Dossier 2025) match, and the note on exclusions is appropriate but not evaluative.
- Overall for b): Incomplete enumeration (missing separation of scorecards and signed offer) and structural deviation; deduct ~4 points from a potential 5, as this halves the listed items' count and precision.

#### Holistic Assessment
- Strengths: Captures core elements without hallucinations like KYC/AML (aligning with the note). Structure is clear and process-ordered.
- Weaknesses: Adds non-existent decision point (affects accuracy); under-lists documents by merging/omitting distinct ones (affects completeness). These are not "small" under strictness—they fundamentally mismatch the ground truth's exact count, separation, and focus on conditional branches/gates/documents.
- Total score reflects ~40% alignment (major errors in both parts outweigh partial correctness), starting from 10.0 and deducting heavily for differences.
