**9.0**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligned with the ground truth, correctly identifying and describing all three decision points using exact terminology (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)) with precise conditions and flows. The required documents list is complete and matches the source exactly, superior in fidelity to the original phrasing (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)", "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template") where the ground truth abbreviates slightly.

Minor deductions for:
- Small additions not in ground truth: explicit "Compares scores from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**", "continue to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**", and "If approved, proceed to **Disburse Funds**" (accurate per process but extraneous to GT's concise style; -0.5).
- Formatting/structure differences: bullet points vs numbered list, bolding/headers vs #### and italics, intro sentence, "(submission time)" label (-0.3).
- No equivalent to ground truth's positional context ("branch after...", "after...") or closing note (-0.2).

No factual errors, no omissions, full compliance with prompt constraints.
