### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, capturing all three core decision points with precise terminology from the process (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," "Final Micro-loan Board Approval") and correctly describing their logic without introducing forbidden standard loan terms. The required documents list is complete and matches the ground truth in content, directly quoting the prompt's exact phrasing where relevant (e.g., "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)," "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)"). No factual errors or omissions occur.

However, under utmost strictness, minor differences warrant deductions:
- **Decision Points (0.8-point deduction)**: Includes unneeded step numbers (e.g., "(Step 5)"), which the ground truth omits for a cleaner summary. Phrasing is slightly more verbose/explanatory (e.g., "Decision based on whether..." vs. ground truth's concise "If... ⇒"), adds an implied continuation detail ("continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check") not explicitly in ground truth, omits contextual positioning (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split," "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), and lacks "(MBA)" abbreviation plus bolded "**Approve** or **Reject**." Uses "15k" shorthand instead of full "€15 000." These are small additions/abridgments but accumulate as non-exact matches.
- **Required Documents (0.2-point deduction)**: Minor extras like "(CIS) template" (ground truth shortens to "(CIS)"), while matching elsewhere; lacks ground truth's numbering and closing note emphasizing exclusions (though the prompt doesn't require it, ground truth includes it as part of the "complete list" framing).

Total score reflects near-perfect alignment (95% match) but penalizes phrasing/context variances as "small errors" per instructions.
