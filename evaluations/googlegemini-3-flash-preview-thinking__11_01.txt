9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 ranked correctly by avg waiting time; both avg and p95 quoted accurately (e.g., 36.5/120.0, decimals preserved). +10
- **No unwarranted content**: Fully compliant—no service times, throughput, or extra activities. +10
- **Format/structure**: Proper executive memo (To:, Subject:, concise <150 words), but differs from ground truth's terse #1/#2/#3 list (no header). Minor deduction. -0.3
- **Actions**: Logically tied to waiting times, concrete, automation-focused, promise ≥20% (via closing statement). Highly relevant/similar to ground truth (e.g., automation for #1/#2, rules/triage for #3), no unsupported data invented (unlike ground truth's "pilot tests"/"estimated"). Strong, but not identical phrasing/per-action % explicitness. -0.3
- **Strictness adjustment**: Small phrasing diffs (e.g., "36.5h average (120.0h 95p)" vs. "avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h"; "95p" vs. "p95") and general vs. per-action % are minor errors warranting deduction. Overall very close.
