The LLM answer is factually correct (Yes for Q1, identical minimal sequence T1-T2-T7-T4-T5 for Q2) and concisely explains the key mechanism (P2 token preserved via alternative path, competition with T3). Both are under 120 words. However, under utmost strictness: 

- Q1 explanation differs (LLM emphasizes P2 competition; ground truth specifies path T1→T2→T7→T4).
- Q2 lacks step-by-step markings (M₁={P1,P2} etc.), numbered/bolded format, and confirmatory sentence, reducing evidential rigor.
- Minor formatting/structure variances (inline vs. separated/numbered).

No factual errors, but omissions and wording differences warrant deduction from perfect match.
