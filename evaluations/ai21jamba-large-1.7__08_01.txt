The LLM answer is fundamentally flawed and fails to correctly address the prompt. It incorrectly claims a firing sequence where T5 fires immediately after T1 (p1=1, p2=1, p3=0), but T5 requires a token in p3 (normal input arc), which is absent, making the sequence impossible and T5 disabled at that marking. This invalidates the entire example and demonstration. Additional errors include: misstating T5's output as affecting p5 (it goes to p6); fabricating "two paths from p3 to p5"; and incorrectly describing T5's enabling ("p3 –|p4 → p6" implies inhibitor from p3, but it's normal from p3 and inhibitor from p4). The ground truth provides a valid sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3) and precise justification (T5 enabled only pre-T3 due to inhibitor), which the LLM entirely misses. These are not minor issues but core inaccuracies that render the response worthless for proving the claim, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
