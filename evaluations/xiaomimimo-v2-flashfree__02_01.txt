8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4**: Perfect match (identical values).
- **Q5**: Mostly correct (includes all 3 ground truth activities: "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"), but erroneously adds "Quality_Check". This is a clear factual error, as "Quality_Check" *is* the first (and only) event in case "C-77" (timestamp 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00). Per strict criteria, this incorrect inclusion warrants a significant deduction despite partial overlap (~75% accurate list). Unsorted order is acceptable as noted.

**Overall**: Excellent on 80% of questions, but Q5 error prevents a top score. JSON structure and format are flawless. Strict penalty applied for the semantic mistake.
