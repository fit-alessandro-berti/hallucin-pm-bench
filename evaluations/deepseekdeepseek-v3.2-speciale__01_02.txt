**8.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
The LLM answer is semantically accurate and covers all core elements from the prompt (3 decision points correctly identified with exact activity names, all 6 required documents listed verbatim from the process description). However, under utmost strictness, several small textual, phrasing, and structural differences from the ground truth result in point deductions (each ~0.3-0.5 loss for significance):

**Decision Points (high match but deductions for precision/phrasing):**
- Matches 3 points, branches, and logic exactly.
- Deductions:
  - Underwriter Alignment Gate: Uses generic "two independent risk scores" instead of exact "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B scores" (-0.5).
  - No explicit positioning context like GT's "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (-0.3); relies on step numbers instead.
  - Amount Threshold: Adds interpretive/extra "proceeds directly to fund disbursement" (not in GT; GT stops at "auto-approves") and uses "Micro‑loan Board Approval" (missing "Final") (-0.5).
  - MBA: Adds "Approved applications go to fund disbursement" (extra, not in GT); lowercase "approve/reject" vs GT's **Approve**/**Reject** (-0.2).
  - Verbose dashes/expansion vs GT's concise *If...* italics.

**Required Documents (close but deductions for wording/structure):**
- All 6 items present with exact names.
- Deductions:
  - Phrasing diffs: "≤ 3 months old" (+ "old", thin spaces) vs "(≤ 3 months)"; "single pay‑stub or tax slip" (+ "single"/"or") vs "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "(CIS) template" (+ "template") vs "(CIS)" (-0.4 total).
  - Bullet list vs GT numbered 1-6 (-0.2).
  - Misses GT's "(complete list)" subtitle and closing note "*(No credit bureau...)*" (-0.2).
  - Header "**Required Documents (at submission time)**" vs "#### Required documents (complete list)".

Total deductions ~1.5 from 10.0 → **8.5**. No factual errors or omissions of content, but strict textual fidelity penalizes additions/abbreviations/context mismatches.
