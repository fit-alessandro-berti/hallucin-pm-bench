9.5

- The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all factual respects: the number of distinct cases, the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" for C456, and the activity that appears exactly once.
- The only very minor deviation is a slightly more redundant answer style ("distinct cases (C456, C123, C789)" instead of the more concise "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"). However, since this does not introduce factual inaccuracy or ambiguity, the answer is almost perfect.
- Deducting 0.5 points to reflect very strict grading for the minor lack of format conciseness compared to the ground truth.
