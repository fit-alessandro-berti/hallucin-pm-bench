9.0  
- The LLM answer is factually correct across all three questions, accurately identifying the 3 distinct cases, the preceding activity "Pack_Items" for C456's "Ship_Order", and "Cancel_Order" as the unique activity.  
- Minor deductions for slight non-conciseness in Q2 and Q3 (full sentences vs. ground truth's direct naming) and case order difference in Q1 (C456 first vs. C123 first), per strict evaluation criteria.
