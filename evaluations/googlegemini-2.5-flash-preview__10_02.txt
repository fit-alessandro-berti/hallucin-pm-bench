4.0

---

**Justification and Error Analysis:**

- **Missing Role:** The LLM answer omits "Operations Manager" entirely, which is present in the Ground Truth as accountable ("A") for every task. This is a major deviation. The number of columns (roles) is insufficient.
- **R/A Role Assignments:** The LLM answer frequently combines R and A in the same cell (e.g., “R, A” for Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison), instead of separating these roles with only one “A” per task and distributing responsibility as in ground truth. This blurs accountability, which RACI is designed to clarify.
- **Mandated Wording for Tasks:** Some tasks do not strictly use mandated or source terminology; e.g., "Screen vs. Sanctions List" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List", "Be Informed of Case File Archival" vs. "Archive Record". There is also an invented activity: "Be Informed of Case File Archival"—the ground truth simply informs the Regulatory Liaison, not creates a full task.
- **Consulted/Informed:** Many tasks omit C/I markings, several are missing entirely. For example, the Transaction Analyst for KYC Review should be C (Consulted), not blank.
- **Over-split Tasks:** The LLM invents or needlessly splits steps, e.g., “Be Informed of Case File Archival” is not in the source or the ground truth.
- **IT Support:** Double-marks “R, A” for some tasks, when "Archive Record" should be R only, A belongs to Operations Manager per ground truth.
- **Table Format:** The required legend for RACI is missing, although markdown table format is followed.

**Summary:**  
The LLM output is missing an entire key role (Operations Manager), misassigns and conflates RACI roles, omits/hides much of the C and I, invents or muddles tasks, and is careless in task phrasing. These are critical RACI and vocabulary compliance errors.

**Score: 4.0—major gaps and non-compliances; substantial improvement needed to adhere to directions and match the ground truth.**
