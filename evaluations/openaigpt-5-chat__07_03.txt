The LLM answer contains all the required differences under the correct headings and does not introduce any commentary. However, it loses points for not following the exact formatting of the headings (adds dashes and spacing) and the formatting (not using a monospaced style or properly aligning IDs under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES as in the ground truth). These are minor formatting errors but, based on the requested strictness, they warrant a deduction. All substantive content is present and correct.
