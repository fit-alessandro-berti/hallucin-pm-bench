The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed task, and both gateway type changes) with accurate IDs, names, and type notations matching the prompt's format and the XML snippets. However, it introduces formatting errors: headings are incorrectly prefixed with "-" (treating them as bullets, unlike the ground truth's plain headings), sub-items have inconsistent indentation (extra spaces), and the gateway lines lack the exact spacing/alignment (e.g., no extra spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" to match the ground truth's aligned "exclusive"). These deviations from the required verbatim structure and ground truth exactness warrant a deduction, but the core content is precise without additions, omissions, or commentary.
