- The LLM answer does use only the four mandated terms for activity names, which is positive.
- However, several significant errors remain in activity structure and role mapping:

**Vocabulary/Activity Naming:**
- “Approval Decision” is a renamed activity and **not authorized** by policy; should be “Compliance Officer Approval”.
- “Release Funds” is permitted, but “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, and “Risk Scoring” are present as required, so no deduction here.

**RACI Assignment:**
- The ground truth has “R, A” for most main tasks, but the LLM sometimes assigns R/A, but elsewhere splits A or R incorrectly.
    - For “Risk Scoring”, ground truth has Compliance Analyst as R, Compliance Officer as A, and Front-Office Analyst as C—but the LLM answer lists Compliance Analyst as R/A and omits the “C” for others.
    - For “Release Funds”, LLM correctly lists Treasury Ops as R/A, but neglects to list Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer as C, and Front-Office Analyst as I only.

**Missing or Incorrect Consulted/Informed:**
- The LLM omits nearly all “C” assignments where required (Consulted), e.g., Compliance Officer as C during Intake Vetting/KYC Review/AML Screening, Compliance Analyst as C in Compliance Officer Approval.
- “I”s are sometimes missing or misassigned (e.g., in “Compliance Officer Approval”—should have Front-Office Analyst: I, Compliance Analyst: C, Treasury Ops: —).

**Omission of dashes:**  
- The LLM uses blanks where the ground truth uses “–”.

**Summary:**
- The overall structure is close, activities are mostly present and in correct terminology, but there is incorrect activity naming (“Approval Decision”) and major misassignments/omissions in RACI roles (especially C/I/– distinctions).
- No forbidden synonyms occur, but the RACI mapping fidelity is not adequate and the activity naming error is notable.
- These are significant, but not total, misses; hence a strict but fair score: **5.5**.
