2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +2.0)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no disallowed synonyms leaking in. This is a strong match to the ground truth and policy.
- **Activities Coverage and Structure (Major Deduction, -4.0)**: The prompt requires covering "every activity and role described" without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM adds unauthorized activities ("Approval Decision" and "Release Funds") with incorrect naming ("Approval Decision" vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval"). It omits or merges implied activities from the narrative (e.g., escalation/approval as a distinct step). The table uses empty cells instead of dashes (–) for no involvement, violating format consistency. Extra sections ("Key" and "Rationale") are unrequested additions, breaching "do not rename, merge, or add."
- **RACI Assignments (Severe Inaccuracy, -3.5)**: Assignments differ substantially from ground truth across all rows:
  - Intake Vetting: LLM limits to Front-Office R/A (empty elsewhere); ground truth adds Compliance C, Treasury I.
  - KYC Review/AML Screening: LLM assigns sole Compliance R/A (empty); ground truth adds Officer C, Treasury I.
  - Risk Scoring: LLM assigns Compliance R/A; ground truth splits as Front C, Compliance R, Officer A, Treasury I.
  - Added "Approval Decision": LLM's Officer A/Treasury I mismatches ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" (Front I, Compliance C, Officer R,A, Treasury –).
  - "Release Funds": LLM's Front I/Treasury R/A misses ground truth's broader involvement (Compliance C, Officer C).
  Notation uses "R/A" without commas or bolding (vs. ground truth's "**R, A**"), reducing clarity.
- **Overall Strictness**: Even minor format issues (e.g., no bolding, empty vs. dashes) and the rationale section warrant significant deductions. The output captures the core four activities but fails on process fidelity, resulting in a low score. No criminal/jailbreak issues detected.
