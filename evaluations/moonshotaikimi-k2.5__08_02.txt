**9.0**

The LLM answer is factually correct (Yes, with the exact minimal sequence T1-T2-T7-T4-T5 demonstrating T5 before T3), insightful (notes P2 token competition), and concise (<120 words). It matches the ground truth core content perfectly.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for:
- Lack of markings (M₁ to M₅) to explicitly verify reachability/step-by-step enabling, as in ground truth.
- Simpler sequence format (comma list vs. numbered list).
- Slightly less structured Q1/Q2 separation and no "minimal" label or disabling confirmation phrasing.

No errors, but strict per instructions on differences/presentation completeness.
