The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content, structure, and factual accuracy across all questions: Q1 is identical (3 distinct cases); Q2 lists the exact sequence for C002 without omissions or additions; Q3 correctly identifies the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock), lists them one per line, and orders them alphabetically, with only minor non-substantive formatting differences (e.g., absence of dashes, which are not required by the prompt). No hallucinations, errors, or deviations detected.
