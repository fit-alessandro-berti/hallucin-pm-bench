The LLM answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, matching the ground truth verbatim in content and format (minor heading bolding is a negligible stylistic difference). However, it omits the verifiable Gateway_Payment change (exclusive â†’ parallel), which is explicitly present in both XML snippets and required under "all functional changes" and "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES." This incompleteness is a significant error under strict evaluation criteria, warranting a substantial deduction despite perfection in the other sections.
