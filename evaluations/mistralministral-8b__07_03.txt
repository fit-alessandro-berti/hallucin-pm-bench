6.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in headings, format, and detail for added/removed tasks and correctly notes the change for Gateway_ReviewNeeded. However, it omits the second gateway type change:

- Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel

According to the standard and instructions, omitting a verifiable gateway type change is a significant functional error. All other parts are correct and formatted properly, but this substantial omission means a significant deduction is warranted, resulting in a score of 6.0.
