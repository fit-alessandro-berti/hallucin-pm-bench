The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (via the T2b shortcut) and provides a partial sequence demonstrating T5 firing without prior T3, but it fails to provide a complete shortest firing sequence that includes T3 after T5 to truly achieve and demonstrate the relative ordering (requiring T6 for re-enabling pc). This omits the feedback loop's role, making the response incomplete and differing significantly from the ground truth's full 6-step sequence, detailed explanation, and proof of minimality. Under strict evaluation, this substantial gap in completeness and accuracy warrants a low score despite the correct high-level insight.
