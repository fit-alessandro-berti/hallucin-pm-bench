10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1, 2a, and 2b (correct counts and percentages with proper calculations and rounding). For question 3, the response is concise (87 words), adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, and fully satisfies the criteria: it explicitly references the single occurrence ("one occurrence"), highlights variance/instability (e.g., "outlier," "anomalous observation," "statistically unsound," insufficient for reliable patterns), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "misrepresenting the activity's true efficiency," "inaccurate predictions when applied to new data"). No errors or inventions detected; response is data-driven and analyst-appropriate.
