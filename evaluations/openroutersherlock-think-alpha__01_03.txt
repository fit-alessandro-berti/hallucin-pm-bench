### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two decision points and describes their rules concisely in one sentence each, closely aligning with the ground truth in content and structure. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., not explicitly stating the "otherwise" branch for the risk skip, and "approvals are obtained" vs. "record 'Approve'") are present but do not alter the core rule meaning. This earns near-full credit (9/10 for this section), but strict evaluation deducts slightly for not matching the exact wording and structure (e.g., ground truth uses numbered list with bolded titles).
- **Part (b)**: The list is mostly accurate in order and inclusion of core documents up to "Offer Sheet 77" and beyond, with no hallucinations (e.g., no invalid KYC/AML mentions). However, it omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (explicitly listed in step 8 of the process and separated in the ground truth), resulting in an incomplete list of 8 items instead of 9. This is a significant error under strict criteria, as it fails to capture all "required" documents in first-appearance order, warranting a major deduction (4/10 for this section).
- **Overall**: Weighted equally, the strong performance in (a) is undermined by the clear omission in (b), leading to a composite score reflecting incompleteness despite no extraneous errors.
