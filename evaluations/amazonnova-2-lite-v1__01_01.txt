**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major differences, ~40% of weight, score 5.0/10)**: 
  - LLM identifies correct logical decisions (eligibility, amount threshold, approvals/rejections) faithful to process description, but structures as 4 separate points vs. GT's precise 3-point table. Introduces unnamed "**High-value refund threshold check (€1,000)**" as a bolded decision/activity (violation of "Do not introduce any activities"; GT neutrally calls it "*Amount threshold*").
  - Splits GT's combined #3 ("Final payment approval at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review**") into #2 and #4, altering grouping/placement.
  - Verbose additions (e.g., "Process terminates; no refund issued", detailed "Determine whether...") not in GT; assumes explicit rejection paths more than GT. Placement nuances differ (e.g., LLM's #2 outcome mentions "(or **Senior_Auditor_Review** if high-value)", but GT specifies threshold *after* Finance).
  - No table format; extra headings/outcomes inflate differences.
  - Small errors: mixed "€1,000"/"€1 000" notation vs. GT's consistent "€1 000"; "proceed to **Process_Refund_Payment**" vs. GT's precise "*Process\_Refund\_Payment** may start".

- **Required Documents (minor differences, ~40% of weight, score 9.5/10)**:
  - Exact same 7 documents listed, matching order/content/conditionals (e.g., AuditTrail "only for > €1 000").
  - Faithful extras like "(signed)" and usage contexts from process desc (GT omits some); "Generated and emailed..." aligns.
  - Minor: Descriptive bullets vs. GT's plain numbered list; no "(No other...)" note equivalent.

- **Overall Structure/Fidelity/Extras (~20% of weight, score 8.0/10)**:
  - Semantic accuracy to prompt high (covers all, no invalid intros except threshold naming), but text/structure diverges significantly from GT (headings, sections, verbosity vs. concise table + list + parenthetical).
  - Unasked "Constraint Reminder" section accurate but adds unmatching content (significant loss per strictness).
  - No legacy activity introduced (good).

**Weighted Total: 7.2**. Close semantically but strict textual/structural differences (count, naming, format, extras) deduct heavily; not a near-match.
