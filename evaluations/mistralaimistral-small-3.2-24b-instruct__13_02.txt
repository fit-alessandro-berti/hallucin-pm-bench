**9.5**

- **Q1:** Correct (Manual_Fraud_Check: “1 time”).
- **Q2a:** Correct (2.08%).
- **Q2b:** Correct (8.33%).
- **Q3:** The answer states: “Low-support activities … may appear rare or anomalous in small samples. Predictive models … overfit, treating the activity as an outlier … Performance metrics … could be skewed if the activity is underrepresented, leading to unreliable conclusions...”
    - (i) Mentions single occurrence/rarity ✅
    - (ii) Touches on instability (overfit, skewed metrics) ✅
    - (iii) Cautions against generalization (“unreliable conclusions in broader datasets”) ✅

**Deduct 0.5**: The answer could more explicitly discuss how “statistics based on one sample are highly unstable/vulnerable to noise, e.g. one odd duration can distort results.” The warning is present, but less concrete on the variance/instability aspect and doesn’t mention confidence intervals or effect of repeated sampling. This is a minor lack of technical specificity.

**Summary:** 9.5 — Very accurate; tiny deduction for not explicitly calling out the instability/variance of single-observation-based metrics.
