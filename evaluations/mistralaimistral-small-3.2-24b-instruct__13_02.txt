8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). Full credit.
- **Question 2a**: Exact match (2.08%, with correct calculation). Full credit.
- **Question 2b**: Exact match (8.33%, with correct calculation). Full credit.
- **Question 3**: Covers required elements (i) implicitly via "low-support" and rarity in small samples, (ii) via overfitting/skewed metrics implying instability/variance, (iii) via caution on unreliable generalization to broader data. However, deducting 1.5 points for lack of explicit "single-occurrence" mention and reliance on general ML concepts (e.g., overfitting, accuracy) rather than process-mining specifics (e.g., cycle time, transitions, confidence intervals) as in ground truth sample. Explanation is concise (68 words) and relevant but not fully aligned in PM context.
