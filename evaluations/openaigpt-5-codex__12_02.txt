The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a concise, accurate justification in one paragraph, citing the exact same counterexamples (C003 with Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order on lines 6-7, and C005 with Validate_Payment on line 11 but no Receive_Order). It fully aligns with the ground truth in substance, proving the claim false, though it uses a slightly less structured format (no bullets) and minor phrasing differences (e.g., "lines 11â€“12 show... with Validate_Payment but no Receive_Order at all" versus the ground truth's explicit "never contains *Receive_Order* at all"), which are negligible but warrant a tiny deduction for not mirroring the exact wording under strict evaluation.
