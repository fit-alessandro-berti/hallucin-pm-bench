### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (full credit)**: Correctly identifies *all* added tasks (3 IDs), the single removed task, and the exact gateway change. No extraneous changes mentioned. Grouped strictly under the 3 required headings. Ignores renamings (e.g., task/gateway names, ApproveLoan tweak) and non-relevant elements (flows, cosmetics).
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Missing task names**: Lists only cryptic IDs (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity`) vs. ground truth's readable **bold names** + `(ID)` format (e.g., **Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)). This omits key descriptive summary info from XML `name` attributes (-1.5).
  - **Gateway wording**: Uses raw XML tags ("exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway") vs. semantic/prompt-expected terms ("**exclusive** (XOR)" → "**inclusive** (OR)") with v1/v2 context (-1.0).
  - **Formatting mismatches**: Bullets (`-`) vs. numbered lists (`1.`); headings with colons and bold (`**Added tasks:**`) vs. italic-bold no-colon (`* **Added tasks**`); no final confirmatory note (-0.5).
- **Overall**: Core content accurate (80% match), but omissions and style deviations reduce readability/precision vs. ground truth. Strict policy applied: ~30% deduction for "small" (but multiple) differences.
