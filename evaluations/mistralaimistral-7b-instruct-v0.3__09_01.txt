**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and violates the system instruction to "Answer only if the question can be supported by the data; otherwise state clearly that the requested value cannot be derived." It fabricates nonexistent durations (e.g., "2", "1", "2", "2" hours), miscounts instances (claims 6 but log shows exactly 4), computes a fake average (1.1667 hours), and provides a misleading explanation. This directly contradicts the ground truth, which accurately identifies the absence of timestamps/durations and rejects computation. No alignment; full deduction for hallucination, factual errors, and policy violation.
