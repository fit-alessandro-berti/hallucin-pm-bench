The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of parallel tasks from Process B, listing "Quality_Check"/"Update_Inventory" as the first set and "Generate_Replenishment_Report"/"Notify_Procurement" as the second set. The numbering (Set 1, Set 2) is accurate and in correct order.

However, the answer omits brief context such as explicitly mentioning these are the "first parallel block" and "second parallel block" as in the ground truth, and does not explicitly state "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." The lack of these (minor, but present) clarifying details represents a small, though significant, difference from the ground truth, warranting a small deduction under strict grading.
