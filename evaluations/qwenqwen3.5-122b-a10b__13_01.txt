10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match in substance, accuracy, and adherence to the data for all questions:
- Q1: Identical count ("1").
- Q2: Precise calculation and rounding ("5.56%"), with explicit verification.
- Q3: Correctly lists the sole case ("A1002").
- Q4: Provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons (small sample size; temporal coverage/single-day bias) that align directly with ground truth options ("Small sample size"; "Temporal bias"), without hallucination or unjustified inference. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., conciseness) do not deviate from facts or requirements.
