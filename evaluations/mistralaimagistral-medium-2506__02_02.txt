The LLM answer is fully accurate and aligns precisely with the ground truth across all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the exact sequence for C002 without deviation; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line, with no extras, omissions, or fabrications. The extended reasoning shows no errors or hallucinations, only correct analysis leading to the final outputs.
