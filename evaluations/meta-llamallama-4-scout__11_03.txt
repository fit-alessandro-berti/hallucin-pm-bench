### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Identification (Activities)**: Correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and waiting times. No invention here. (+2.0 points)
- **Quantification**: Accurately states throughput times, SLAs, exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s), and waiting times for each, grounding in table data. Minor formatting difference (bullets vs. paragraph), but content matches. (+2.0 points)
- **Structure and Formatting**: Major deviations—lacks "From" and "Subject" lines; uses bullets for activity descriptions (violates "bullet points only for the recommendations"); includes an introductory paragraph not in ground truth; no analysis of total cases or bolding. Memo feels less executive and formal. (-2.0 points from potential)
- **Recommendations**: Provides one action per activity in bullets, but they are generic and weakly data-driven (e.g., "automated document review" lacks specificity like "rule-based pre-checks for low-risk"; no ties to peaks, thresholds, or projections). Ground truth's actions are more concrete and include projected impact (35% reduction), which is absent. Significant loss for lack of precision and depth. (-3.0 points from potential)
- **Overall Compliance**: Word count ≈130 (close to ≈150, minor); sticks to table data without inventions (good), but omits closing projection and process context (e.g., "loan-origination," total cases). Strict deduction for cumulative small errors in formality, specificity, and exact adherence to ground truth style. Total reflects partial match on essentials but substantial gaps elsewhere.
