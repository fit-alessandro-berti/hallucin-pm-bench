The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides accurate justifications by citing the two counterexample cases (C002 with "Pack_Items" intervening, and C004 with "Check_Fraud" intervening), which is sufficient to disprove the "always" claim. This aligns with the core reasoning in the ground truth. However, deductions are applied for: (1) irrelevant extraneous content in the summary (e.g., references to "high-level process model," "incoming initiatives," and adaptation suggestions, which go beyond the prompt's instruction to rely only on the log evidence and justify via CaseIDs/sequences); (2) lack of comprehensiveness by not analyzing all cases (ground truth includes C001 and C003 as compliant for fuller verification); and (3) slightly less structured presentation (no table or explicit case-by-case for all, though the justification section is clear). These are minor deviations but warrant a strict reduction from a perfect score under the evaluation criteria.
