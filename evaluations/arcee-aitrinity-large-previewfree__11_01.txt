**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 by avg waiting time correctly ranked (Request_Documents 36.5/120.0, Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0, Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4 h). Numbers quoted verbatim from table (+2.5/2.5).
- **No unwarranted content**: Minor violation – closing sentence discusses "throughput" (explicitly forbidden by prompt), though no figures/metrics given. No other activities, service-time, or extraneous data (+2.0/2.5, deduct 0.5 for throughput mention).
- **Action relevance**: All 3 actions concrete, logically tied to waiting times, promise >20% cut, no unsupported data invented. Data-driven as process analyst recommendations. However, completely different from GT actions/wording (e.g., automation vs reminders; batch vs e-signature; checklists vs rules-engine) and generic ">20%" vs GT's specific "≥25%", "30%", "20-25%" (+2.0/2.5, deduct 0.5 for divergence).
- **Format/structure/word count**: Polished memo format fits "executive memo" (≤150 words, ~110). GT is bare list – added headers/closing enhance but diverge (+1.5/2.5, deduct 0.5 for extras like "customer satisfaction", "**End Memo**").
- **Overall strictness**: Fulfills core prompt (9/10 alignment), but differences from GT (actions, phrasing, extras) and throughput violation cause targeted deductions. No small errors overlooked.
