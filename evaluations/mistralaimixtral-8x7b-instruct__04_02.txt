4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Format**: Matches prompt (status + ≤20-word justification per rule, overall result). Minor deduction for missing bolding (**Compliant** etc.). (-0.5)
- **R1**: Status correct; justification adequate but omits "followed by" sequence explicitly. (-0.5)
- **R2**: Status **wrong** (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores post-Change new approval as "last required," misapplying timeline. (-2.0)
- **R3**: Status correct; justification accurate on dates/precedence. (Full)
- **R4**: Status and justification correct. (Full)
- **R5**: Status **wrong** (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores "before any further processing step" (Ship/Pay pre-new approval). (-2.0)
- **R6**: Status and justification correct. (Full)
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but incomplete (misses R2/R5). (-1.0)

**Total**: Major conceptual errors on R2/R5 (change request implications) cause severe deduction under strict criteria; only partial credit for R3 catch.
