**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the deterministic ground truth exactly (count=1; 2a=2.08%; 2b=8.33%, rounded correctly to two decimals). For 3, it is ≤100 words (68), explicitly notes single-occurrence (1/48 events, 1/12 cases), addresses variance/instability (skewing averages, overfitting to outlier C05), and cautions against over-generalization (inflates perceived frequency/impact, poor generalization from slice, misleading insights). All criteria met with no invention, errors, or omissions; minor phrasing variations in explanation are permitted.
