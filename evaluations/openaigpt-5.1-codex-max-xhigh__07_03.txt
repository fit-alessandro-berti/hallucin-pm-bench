The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: the three added tasks, the one removed task, and the two gateway type changes, using the exact required format for ids, names, and change descriptions (e.g., "exclusive → parallel"). Headings are verbatim. No extras, omissions, or commentary.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Extra blank lines between sections (after each list, before next heading; absent in ground truth).
- Missing alignment spaces in second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive" vs. LLM's "Gateway_Payment: exclusive").

These whitespace/layout differences are small errors but warrant significant point loss per instructions (deducting 1.0 total). Content match is otherwise exact.
