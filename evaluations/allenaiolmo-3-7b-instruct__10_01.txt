**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Vocabulary Policy (STRICT)**: 10/10. Uses exact “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance” with proper capitalization; no forbidden terms (e.g., no “Customer Due Diligence”, “Order Validation”, “Payment Processing”).
- **Correctness of RACI Allocations**: 0/10. Completely fails to reflect the process narrative:
  - No activity has *exactly one Responsible* (all rows have multiple R's; violates standard RACI and ground truth).
  - Account Manager not *Accountable* where appropriate (e.g., not R/A for Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer).
  - Every single cell differs from ground truth (e.g., Receive Application: ground truth AM **R/A**, CO C, FC/IT I → LLM AM C, CO/FC A, IT R; total mismatch across all 24 cells).
  - Ignores narrative ownership (e.g., Compliance Officer owns KYC Review as R, not LLM's A with multiples).
- **Format & Structure**: 4/10. Basic table present with correct rows/columns/activities, but:
  - Column headers differ (adds abbreviations in parentheses; ground truth uses clean names only).
  - No bolding/emphasis on key R/A cells as in ground truth.
  - No **R/A** dual notation.
- **Unwarranted Content**: 0/10. Adds unrequested extras:
  - Intro text ("Certainly...", title "Order-to-Cash process", closing "Let me know...").
  - Legend (not in ground truth or prompt).
- **Overall Fidelity**: Major deviations in core deliverable (RACI content); minor credits for skeleton/table/terms insufficient under "utmost strictness" where "small errors" demand "significant loss" and differences dominate.

Total reflects ~20% alignment (terms + skeleton) vs. 80%+ errors/mismatches.
