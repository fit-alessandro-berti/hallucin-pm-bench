### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary policy (STRICT)**: Perfect compliance (10/10). Uses exact "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance" with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms appear.
- **Structure**: Activities and roles match exactly (rows/columns correct, no extras or unwarranted content) (8/10). Minor deductions for including role abbreviations in headers (e.g., "(AM)") not present in ground truth, and unnecessary "Legend" (incomplete, omits C/I definitions).
- **RACI Content & Allocations**: Major failures (0/10). 
  - Oversimplifies to only R/A on primary role per row (correctly identifies Responsible from narrative), with "—" everywhere else. Ground truth provides **full RACI designations** (R, A, C, I in every cell, no blanks).
  - Misses all secondary assignments: e.g., 
    | Activity | Key Differences |
    |----------|-----------------|
    | Receive Application | CO/FC/IT: — vs. C/I/I |
    | **KYC Review** | AM: — vs. **A**; FC/IT: — vs. C/I |
    | **Order Vetting** | CO/FC/IT: — vs. C/I/I |
    | Payment Clearance | AM/CO/IT: — vs. A/C/I |
    | Record Update | AM/CO/FC: — vs. C/I/C |
    | Notify Customer | CO/FC/IT: — vs. I/I/I |
  - Does not reflect nuanced narrative inference in ground truth (e.g., AM as A for KYC Review/Payment Clearance; distributed C/I).
  - Formatting diffs: No bolding on key activities (**KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**) or cells (**R**, **R / A**); "R/A" vs. "**R / A**" (spacing/bolding).
- **Overall**: Partial credit for vocabulary/structure/primary Rs matching narrative handlers, but fundamentally incomplete/wrong as RACI matrix (not full designations). Significant point loss per strictness rule for numerous cell-level differences. Equivalent to ~10% match on content cells.
