8.5

The LLM answer accurately states that the requested metrics cannot be computed due to the lack of timestamp data. It correctly identifies that start_time and complete_time are redacted and that without them, durations cannot be measured. This matches the core reasoning of the ground truth.

However, there are minor differences:

- The ground truth stresses that "all event rows" are missing and clarifies that no executions of "Approve Invoice" are available, not just that timestamps are redacted.
- The LLM answer is slightly less explicit about the total lack of event data and focuses more on the columns rather than explicitly indicating the entire absence of rows (case/activity data).
- The ground truth also highlights the requirement for additional raw log entries, which the LLM answer omits.

While these are subtle distinctions, they convey a little more context and completeness in the ground truth answer. Therefore, a notable but not severe deduction: 8.5.
