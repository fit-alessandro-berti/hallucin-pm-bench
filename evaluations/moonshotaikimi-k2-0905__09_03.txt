The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to redacted timestamps and explaining the core issue (lack of duration data) in a concise, single-paragraph format without guessing or extraneous details. It explicitly references the target activity and all required metrics, fulfilling the task's precision requirement. Minor deduction for slightly less emphasis on the full redaction of event rows (focusing more narrowly on timestamp columns/values) and not noting the need for additional data, which the ground truth includes for completenessâ€”though neither is strictly required by the prompt.
