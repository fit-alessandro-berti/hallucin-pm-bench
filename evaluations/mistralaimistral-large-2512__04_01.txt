**4.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as **Non-compliant** (matching ground truth) and accurately detects the Rule 2 violation (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods). Rule 4 and Rule 5 are correctly assessed as satisfied (despite confusing wording on Rule 4). However, major errors deduct heavily under strict criteria:

- **Rule 1**: Falsely claimed as violated due to a critical misreading of the trace (approvals at events 2–3 are *before* Expedite_Flag at 4 and Issue_PO at 5; LLM erroneously states approvals occur "after" event 4). Ground truth correctly marks satisfied. (-3.0 points)
- **Rule 3**: Falsely claimed as compliant by miscounting distance (events 7–9 intervene between 6 and 10, distance=3 > ≤2; LLM ignores event 9 and claims only "events 7 and 8 intervene, totaling 2 steps"). Ground truth correctly marks violated. (-2.5 points)
- **Format/Structure**: Deviates from ground truth's clean 1–5 numbered rule-by-rule assessment with summary; LLM uses inconsistent numbering, self-corrections, bolding, and "primary violations" summary. Minor but penalized. (-0.5 points)

Correct overall verdict and partial accuracy prevent a lower score, but factual trace errors and flipped Rule 1/3 assessments make it substantially divergent.
