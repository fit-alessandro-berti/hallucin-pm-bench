1.0

The LLM answer introduces completely invalid and non-standard BPMN 2.0 XML elements (e.g., `seqProp`, `messageOnlyPropProp`, `stageEventPropProp`), miscalculates the SLA duration as 120 minutes instead of 48 hours (PT48H), fails to properly enforce the deadline by interrupting or routing to the existing `Activity_AMReview` escalation path, and provides a justification that describes ineffective monitoring rather than true SLA compliance, resulting in near-total deviation from the ground truth solution.
