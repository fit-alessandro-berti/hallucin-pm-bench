The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and precision: both correctly identify the impossibility due to redacted event rows and absent timestamps in Artefact A, explicitly reference the lack of data for “Approve Invoice” durations, cover all required metrics (average cycle time, std dev/CI), form a single short explanatory paragraph, and avoid guessing or using external info/SLA. Minor deductions for slightly different phrasing (e.g., LLM's "row data—including every timestamp and case detail" vs. ground truth's "all event rows and every timestamp"; LLM omits explicitly naming "dispersion" but lists "standard deviation"; no mention of needing "additional raw log entries" which ground truth includes as a precise implication). These are trivial stylistic variances with no impact on correctness under strict evaluation.
