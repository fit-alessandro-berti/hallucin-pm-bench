8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of Core Answer**: The LLM correctly answers "No," matching the ground truth. It accurately identifies the contradicting cases (C002 and C004) and supporting cases (C001 and C003), with proper sequences cited for justification. This aligns well with the task requirements (Yes/No + case-based justification).
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive case-by-case breakdown, clear sequences, and logical conclusion that "always" is violated due to counterexamples. Covers all relevant CaseIDs from the log.
- **Differences and Errors (Strict Assessment)**:
  - **Minor Factual Overstatement**: The introductory justification includes "or where Validate_Payment does not follow Receive_Order at all." This is inaccurate—all cases show Validate_Payment following Receive_Order (just not immediately in C002/C004). No case lacks it entirely. This is a small but clear error in precision, warranting a deduction (e.g., ~1.0-1.5 points under strict rules).
  - **Format and Structure**: LLM uses a bulleted list, which is clear but less organized than the ground truth's table (with explicit ✅/❌ indicators and concise notes). This reduces fidelity slightly, as the table better highlights "immediate successor" visually (~0.5 point deduction).
  - **Completeness**: No omissions of log evidence; relies only on the snippet as instructed. No extraneous info.
- **Overall**: High fidelity (90%+ match in content), but strict penalties for the wording error and format divergence lower it from a perfect 10.0. If error-free and table-matched, it would score 9.5-10.0.
