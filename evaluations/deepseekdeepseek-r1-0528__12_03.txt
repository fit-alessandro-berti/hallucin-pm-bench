The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth: it answers "No," cites both violating cases (C002, C004), provides the precise sequences showing the intermediate activities, and briefly mentions that C001 and C003 do comply, making the reasoning clear.

However, compared to the ground truth—which systematically examines all cases in a table for completeness and explicitly labels the "immediate successor?" status for each, even for the compliant cases—the LLM answer's justification is slightly less thorough. In detail, it merely mentions (in passing) that C001 and C003 comply, rather than systematically presenting the sequences for all cases. It lacks tabular/numeric clarity on the "immediate successor" status for each case.

These are relatively minor omissions, but with "utmost strictness," completeness and direct alignment with the ground truth format should be rewarded. Thus, a 1-point deduction applies.
