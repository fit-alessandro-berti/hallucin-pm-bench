The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (matching ground truth), provides the exact minimal correct firing sequence ⟨T1, T2, T5⟩ to demonstrate T5 firing before T3 (matching core of ground truth), and offers a brief, accurate step-by-step justification with correct markings and inhibitor arc explanation. No factual errors, and it adheres precisely to the prompt's request for "one concrete firing sequence ... and justify briefly."

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Lack of ground truth's deeper insight ("must fire before T3 if ever to occur," with permanence proof via inhibitor behavior post-T3), which adds analytical value though not strictly required.
- Stylistic/presentation differences: compact ⟨σ⟩ vs. numbered list; {p1:1} notation vs. `p1 = 1`; no continuation to T3/T4 (ground truth includes, despite its own invalid T4 firing due to p3=0 post-T5).

Superior to ground truth in avoiding its simulation error (T4 impossible after sequence). Utmost strictness applied, but semantic fidelity and correctness warrant high score.
