9.5

The LLM answer is semantically perfect, identifying exactly the correct added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), removed task (Task_ManualReview), and gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with precise id-name formatting matching the prompt's instructions. No extra commentary, no unchanged elements mentioned, headings verbatim and in order.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for formatting differences from ground truth: absence of bullet points ("-") before each item (present in all ground truth lines) and lack of alignment spaces in the second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"). These are small visual/style variances, not content errors, but per strict criteria, they warrant a slight reduction from 10.0. Whitespace/newlines are equivalent.
