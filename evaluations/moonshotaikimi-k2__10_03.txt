3.0

The LLM answer demonstrates significant deviation from both the vocabulary policy and the ground truth process structure.

Major issues:
- The RACI table columns are labeled with activity names ("Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," etc.) instead of the required role headers. This is not compliant with the process narrative and the ground truth layout.
- The matrix omits two required activities: **Compliance Officer Approval** and **Release Funds**.
- Role involvement and RACI assignments are incorrect compared to the ground truth. For example, the Front-Office Analyst is not shown as "R, A" for "Intake Vetting".
- The answer doesn't use "R, A" or "–" per the prescribed conventions.
- “A” (Accountable) is not assigned as per the ground truth; often it is missing or misassigned.
- The output doesn't faithfully map roles and activities as described; for instance, Treasury Ops are not marked “R, A” for “Release Funds,” and so on.

Minor issues:
- The table lacks clarity—because activities are columns, roles are rows (opposite the provided standard), making it harder to compare.
- The "Consulted" (C) and "Informed" (I) assignments are not supported by the process flow.

Positive:
- The required strict vocabulary was used for activities, and no forbidden synonyms are present.

Due to the incorrect matrix structure, missing activities, numerous RACI misassignments, and deviation from output conventions, this answer merits a low score (3.0) despite respect for the naming policy.
