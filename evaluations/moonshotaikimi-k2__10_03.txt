### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is fundamentally flawed in several critical ways when strictly compared to the ground truth, resulting in a low score. Key issues include:

- **Incomplete Coverage of Activities**: The prompt explicitly requires covering "**every activity** described" in the process narrative. The ground truth identifies six distinct activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring, Compliance Officer Approval, Release Funds) to fully encompass the narrative, including escalation/approval and fund release steps. The LLM only includes the four mandated vocabulary terms, omitting "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". This violates the "covering every activity" directive and the "do not merge" rule by implicitly merging or ignoring later steps. Major deduction for incompleteness.

- **Incorrect RACI Assignments**: Numerous mismatches in responsibilities:
  - Intake Vetting: LLM assigns R to Front-Office Analyst (partial match) but adds erroneous C to Compliance Officer (ground truth has –) and C to Compliance Analyst (should be C, but combined with other errors).
  - KYC Review: LLM has R for Compliance Analyst (partial), but ground truth specifies R,A; LLM adds I to Front-Office/Treasury (correct) but erroneous C to Compliance Officer (should be C—wait, matches, but offset by others).
  - AML Screening: Similar partial R for Compliance Analyst, but ground truth R,A; erroneous C to Officer.
  - Risk Scoring: LLM has R for Compliance Analyst and A for Compliance Officer (partial match to ground truth's R for Analyst, A for Officer), but erroneous I for Front-Office (should be C) and C for Treasury (should be I).
  - No entries for the two missing activities, making the entire matrix invalid for full process coverage.
  These are not minor; they misrepresent accountability (e.g., no R,A combinations where ground truth specifies), leading to significant point loss per strictness guideline.

- **Structural Differences**: The LLM uses rows for roles and columns for activities, while ground truth reverses this (rows for activities, columns for roles). Though not explicitly prohibited, this inverts the typical RACI presentation and complicates direct comparison, especially with missing activities. Minor deduction, but contributes to overall inaccuracy.

- **Vocabulary Compliance (One Positive)**: The LLM correctly uses only the four authorized terms exactly as specified ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no synonyms or leaks from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment"). This prevents a total zero but does not offset the core failures.

Overall, the answer adheres to vocabulary policy but fails utterly on completeness, accuracy, and full process representation. Small errors (e.g., extra Cs) compound with major omissions, justifying a score near the minimum under utmost strictness.
