**8.0**

Q1-Q4 are exactly correct (no differences). Q5 has all correct items from ground truth but erroneously includes one extra incorrect item ("Quality_Check", which *does* appear as the first event in case C-77). Under utmost strictness, this factual error and mismatch in list contents (4 items vs. 3) deducts 2.0 points despite the partial match. JSON structure and format are otherwise perfect.
