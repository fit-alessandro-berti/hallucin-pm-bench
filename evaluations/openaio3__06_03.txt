The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, in the proper order, with no extraneous information about other processes. It adheres closely to the prompt's requirements for conciseness and focus. Minor deductions for formatting differences (use of curly braces {} instead of parallel notation like â€–, and lack of descriptive labels or the confirmatory sentence in the ground truth), which slightly deviate from the ground truth's structure and emphasis, even though the core content is identical and the prompt does not mandate those elements.
