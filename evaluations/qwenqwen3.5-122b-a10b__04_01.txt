**8.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" and accurately pinpoints the two violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event citations matching the ground truth. Descriptions of violations are substantively correct (e.g., reversed order for Rule 2; post-Goods_Received positioning for Rule 3, with intervening events listed accurately, even if "4 activities after" slightly differs from ground truth's "distance=3" phrasing—negligible as both confirm violation).

However, significant deductions for:
- **Incompleteness (major difference):** Ground truth systematically audits *all 5 rules* (satisfies 1,4,5; violates 2,3) with numbered structure aligned to rule numbers, plus summary conclusion. LLM omits verification of Rules 1,4,5 (critical for thorough audit, especially Rule 1 triggered by PO_Amount >€10k).
- **Structural mismatch:** Lacks full rule-by-rule enumeration, summary rationale ("because at least one violated"), and exhaustive coverage expected for a "senior process-audit bot."
- **Minor phrasing:** No explicit confirmation of compliant rules or final bolded recap.

Under utmost strictness, these omissions and mismatches (not minor errors) warrant deduction from perfect score, despite flawless violation analysis.
