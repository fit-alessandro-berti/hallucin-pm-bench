### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No"), aligning with the ground truth on the core decision. It accurately cites relevant counterexamples (C002 and C004) with timestamps and sequences, disproving the "always" claim by highlighting intervening activities (Pack_Items in C002, Check_Fraud in C004). This fulfills the task's requirements for justification using CaseIDs and sequences.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Incompleteness (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: The ground truth exhaustively analyzes *all* cases (C001–C004), confirming where the rule holds (C001, C003) to contextualize the violations. The LLM omits these, making its justification less comprehensive and potentially overlooking partial adherence in the log. For a "meticulous process-mining analyst," full case coverage is expected to rigorously assess the "always" assertion against the entire excerpt.
- **Phrasing inaccuracies (moderate deduction: -0.5 points)**: In C002, the LLM's wording ("Activity that should have occurred after Receive_Order is Pack_Items, not Validate_Payment") introduces an unintended normative tone ("should"), implying expectation rather than pure observation from the log. This subtly deviates from neutral, evidence-based analysis.
- **Structural differences (minor deduction: -0.0 points)**: No table or explicit "two out of four" quantification (as in ground truth), but this is stylistic and doesn't alter factual correctness; the prompt doesn't mandate a table.

Overall, the answer is strong on disproving the FACT but loses points for not matching the ground truth's thoroughness and precision. A perfect score would mirror the comprehensive case-by-case breakdown without phrasing quirks.
