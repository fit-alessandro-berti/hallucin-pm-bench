The LLM answer proposes the identical XML change (reducing `Task_CollectEquipment` dueDate from "P5D" to "P2D") as the ground truth, fully complying with rules by modifying only an existing attribute without adding/deleting elements. Minor deductions for: non-identical diff wrapper (extra file headers "--- OnboardingProcess.xml", line numbers "@@ -19,1 +19,1 @@" vs ground truth's minimal "@@ ... @@"), slightly different section headers ("### 1. Unified Diff" vs "### Diff (single hunk)"), leading "---", absence of bolding in rationale, and semantically equivalent but non-word-for-word matching rationale (e.g., "standard business week" and "late-stage SLA breaches" vs "contractual 3-day SLA" and "without introducing any new activities"). Under utmost strictness, these format and phrasing variances warrant a high-but-not-perfect score.
