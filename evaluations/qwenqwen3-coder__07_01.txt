### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences—added tasks (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive. It adheres strictly to the required headings (including the exact bullet format with "•"), uses XML-exact element identifiers (IDs and tag names), and avoids speculation or extraneous details.
- **Weaknesses (point deductions)**: 
  - For added and removed tasks, the LLM lists only IDs, omitting the descriptive `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" for `check_vip`), which the ground truth includes prominently. The prompt's instruction to "use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML" implies referencing the `name` attributes for clarity, making this an incomplete representation (significant deduction: -1.5 points).
  - Gateway change description lacks the ground truth's explicit versioning ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), using a simpler arrow notation instead. While concise, this deviates from the ground truth's structure and detail (minor deduction: -1.0 point).
  - No inclusion of the ground truth's formatting (bold headings, italic bullets, or final note), but this is secondary to content accuracy.
- **Overall Strictness**: Core facts match (80% alignment), but omissions in descriptive details and phrasing reduce precision against the ground truth, warranting a mid-high score rather than perfect. No major errors like fabricating differences, but strict criteria penalize incompleteness.
