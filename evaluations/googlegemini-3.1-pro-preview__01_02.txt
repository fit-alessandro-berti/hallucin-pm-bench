**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer is strong in content accuracy (correctly identifies the exact 3 decision points using precise terminology from the process, lists all 6 required documents verbatim from the source prompt without additions or standard loan terms) but incurs deductions for stylistic, structural, and minor fidelity differences versus the ground truth:

- **High fidelity strengths (+ base 9.0)**: Decision points match exactly in identity, conditions, and outcomes (e.g., ≤2 points difference, escalation to Harmonisation Committee, <€15k auto-approve vs ≥€15k to MBA, board approve/reject). Documents are **more faithful to source** than GT (e.g., retains "≤ 3 months old", "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template"), lists all completely without omissions.
  
- **Penalties (total -0.8)**:
  - **Structure/formatting (-0.3)**: Verbose headers ("### **Decision Points...**"), intro/outro phrases ("Here is the summary...", "Every application must include...", "***"), *Condition:*/*Outcome:* sub-bullets, unnumbered decisions vs GT's "####", concise numbered lists with *if* syntax, and numbered docs. No matching GT's minimal "#### Decision points" / "#### Required documents".
  - **Flow specificity missing (-0.2)**: Omits explicit positions like GT's "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" – critical for summarizing process branches strictly.
  - **Extra/verbose details (-0.2)**: Adds "Evaluates the independent risk scores (0–9) assigned during the Dual Underwriter Split by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" (unnecessary expansion), "(Only for amounts ≥ €15 000)", "before funds can be disbursed"; lowercase *approve*/*reject* vs GT's **Approve**/**Reject**; no GT's closing note "(No credit bureau...)" (a minor omission as it's extra, but contributes to mismatch).
  - **Doc phrasing micro-diffs (-0.1)**: While source-faithful, doesn't match GT's truncations exactly (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs "≤ 3 months"; bullets vs 1-6 numbering).

No factual errors or violations of prompt (exact names used, no standard terminology). Utmost strictness applied: perfect identicality = 10.0; cumulative diffs warrant 8.2 (excellent but non-identical).
