The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with the exact tasks in the correct order and no extraneous or missing elements. It adheres to the required format of numbered lines with comma-separated tasks. The only differences are minor formatting issues: lack of spaces after commas (e.g., "Drawing,Confirm" instead of "Drawing, Confirm"), which deviates slightly from the ground truth's spacing conventions. Under utmost strictness, this small inconsistency warrants a deduction, but the semantic accuracy is perfect.
