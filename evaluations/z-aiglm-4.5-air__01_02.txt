### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies the three core decision points and provides a complete, exact list of required documents matching the prompt's terminology without introducing standard loan terms. However, under strict evaluation, it incurs point deductions for several small but notable differences from the ground truth:

- **Decision Points**:
  - Misses precise underwriter names ("Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" in GT vs. shorthand "Underwriter A and Underwriter B" in LLM), violating "use exactly the activity names given."
  - Adds unnecessary step numbers (e.g., "(Step 5)") and flow details (e.g., "Proceed to Step 9" for auto-approval; "Proceed to Step 9 if approved" for board), which expand beyond GT's concise summary without adding value.
  - Omits contextual positioning (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" in GT).
  - Minor phrasing variances (e.g., "risk scores" vs. "scores"; "> 2 points" vs. implied "else"; "Continue after decision" vs. "for tie-break"; "send to" vs. "Proceed"; lowercase "approve/reject" vs. capitalized).

- **Required Documents**:
  - Mostly matches but includes extra prompt-sourced details omitted in GT's summarized version (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)"; "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"), making it slightly verbose.
  - Omits GT's optional closing note on excluded standard documents, though this is not required.

These differences, while not fatal, reflect deviations in precision, conciseness, and fidelity to GT's exact structure and wording, warranting a deduction from a perfect score. The response remains highly faithful overall.
