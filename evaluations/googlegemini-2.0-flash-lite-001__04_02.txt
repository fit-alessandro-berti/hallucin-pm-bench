5.0

Rationale:
- R1: Correctly marked as Compliant with an adequate justification.
- R2: Marked as Violated with a justification that says Ship_Goods occurred 1 day after the "final approval" (meaning Finance_Approval). However, **the ground truth states the final required approval is the Manager_Approval after the Change_Request, which the model misses**. This rule requires Ship_Goods within two days after the final required approval following a Change_Request, so the LLM justification is incorrect.
- R3: Correctly marked as Violated with correct justification.
- R4: Correctly marked as Not Applicable with correct justification.
- R5: **Incorrectly marked as Compliant**. The model fails to notice that after Change_Request, Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occur before the new Manager_Approval, so the rule is violated. This is a major error.
- R6: Correct.
- Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT, which is correct.

Main problems: The LLM did not recognize the need to consider the Manager_Approval after the Change_Request when evaluating R2 and R5 (especially R5, where it missed a clear violation). Inadequate justifications for R2 and R5.

Thus, while some rules are properly handled (R1, R3, R4, R6), the mishandling of R2 and R5, especially the lack of understanding regarding post-Change_Request process and sequencing, requires a substantial deduction.

Hence, 5.0.
