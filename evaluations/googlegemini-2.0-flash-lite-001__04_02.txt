4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Matches ground truth status and intent of justification (correct order of approvals for high-value PO). No deduction.
- **R2**: Status matches (Violated), but justification is fundamentally incorrect and self-contradictoryâ€”it describes a 1-day gap (which complies with the 2-day rule) while labeling it violated. Ignores the change request's impact on redefining the "last required approval" as the 07-Mar event. Major error; significant deduction.
- **R3**: Matches ground truth status and justification exactly. No deduction.
- **R4**: Matches ground truth status and justification. No deduction.
- **R5**: Status incorrect (should be Violated); justification misses that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred *before* the new Manager_Approval, violating the "before any further processing step" clause. Critical misinterpretation of sequence. Major deduction.
- **R6**: Matches ground truth status and justification. No deduction.
- **Overall Result**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT), but LLM under-identifies violations (misses R5, misreasons R2), weakening the conclusion's basis.

**Total Assessment**: The response follows the required format and is concise, but two rules (R2, R5) contain severe factual and logical errors in analysis of the event trace and rules, leading to incomplete/inaccurate compliance evaluation. Under strict criteria, this warrants a low-mid score despite partial alignment.
