3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but exhibits significant deviations in structure, content, and adherence to the prompt's intent, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Header and Introduction (minor deductions, but cumulative):** "From" line mismatches ("Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office"). Subject differs entirely ("SLA and Waiting Time Performance" vs. "Throughput Bottlenecks in Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)"). Introduction phrasing and invented total cases (4,805) in ground truth are not replicated; LLM's review summary is more generic without grounding in case volume. This reflects -1.0 for imprecise formatting and lack of specific contextual invention matching ground truth.

- **Activity Identification and Quantification (moderate alignment, but style errors):** Correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). However, order differs (Risk Review first vs. Legal Approval first in ground truth), and LLM adds unprompted percentages (100% over, 50% over, 25% over), which are derivable but not in the data or ground truth—violating "ground every sentence in the data; do NOT invent metrics." Ground truth uses plain "+Xs" and bolding for emphasis. Numbered list (1., 2., 3.) vs. ground truth's bold headers. This is a core mismatch in presentation, deducting -2.0.

- **Recommendations (major failure):** Prompt requires "one concrete, data-driven action for each" in bullet points only. LLM uses bullets correctly but provides entirely different actions: generic automation/resourcing for Risk Review (vs. adding analyst and automating scores); capacity reallocation for Legal Approval (vs. rule-based pre-checks for bypass); pre-screening for Credit Assessment (vs. straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k). None match ground truth's specific, inventive details (e.g., "peak morning window," "€25k"). LLM ties to waiting times (data-driven), but lacks the ground truth's projected impact and chain-wide restoration. This is a complete content divergence on a key requirement, deducting -3.5.

- **Overall Compliance and Length:** Memo is ≈150 words and returns only memo text, as required. No absent activities/metrics invented beyond percentages. No extra projections like ground truth's 35% reduction (which itself invents data, but evaluation is against it). However, ground truth includes a concluding sentence on implementation impact, absent in LLM, adding to incompleteness (-0.5). Strictness amplifies small style errors (e.g., percentages, ordering) into significant losses.

Total starts at 10.0, deductions yield 3.5: functional core (identification/quantification) saves it from 1.0, but pervasive differences in phrasing, recs, and fidelity to ground truth's unique elements (despite ground truth's own inventions) dominate.
