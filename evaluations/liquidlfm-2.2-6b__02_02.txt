6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Perfect match to ground truth (3 distinct cases). +3.3 points.
- **Q2**: Mostly correct sequence of activities, but includes extraneous "C002 →" at the start (case ID is not an activity, violating the prompt's focus on "sequence of activities"). Treated as a fabrication/extra element per ground truth instructions. +2.0 points.
- **Q3**: Major omission—lists only "Arrange_Delivery" (one of two distinct predecessors), missing "Check_Stock" (which immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in cases C001 and C003). Incorrectly alphabetizes/incompletely lists (ground truth requires both, one per line, alphabetically: Arrange_Delivery then Check_Stock). Also includes flawed reasoning with timeline errors and incomplete analysis (e.g., misstating C001/C003 sequences). Treated as hallucination/missing elements. +0.7 points.

**Total Score Calculation**: Weighted equally across questions (strict line-by-line factual precision as instructed), resulting in 6.0. The errors in Q2 and especially Q3 (half the required distinct activities omitted) warrant significant deductions, even though Q1 is flawless.
