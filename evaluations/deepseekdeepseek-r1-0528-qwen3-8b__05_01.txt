The LLM answer misplaces the timer on Task_Triage, which monitors completion time *after* reaching triage rather than ensuring *reaching* it within 48 hours from submission, failing the core SLA logic. It lacks specifics like "interrupting boundary," ID assignment, ISO duration (PT48H), and a direct bypassing flow, omitting the escalation mechanism to reuse elements without stalling (e.g., on doc requests). Vague on escalation details. Major conceptual errors outweigh the basic timer suggestion.
