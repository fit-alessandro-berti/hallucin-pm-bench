The LLM answer suggests placing a 48-hour timer boundary event on **Task_Triage**. This is incorrect:

- The timer needs to measure 48 hours from **claim submission** to ensure the claim reaches triage on time. Placing the timer on **Task_Triage** measures time after Task_Triage is active, which is too late (the breach occurs if Task_Triage is not started in time).
- The ground truth correctly applies the timer to **Task_Receive**, immediately after submission, ensuring the timer window starts at the process’s beginning.
- The LLM also vaguely refers to “escalate to an escalation handler,” suggesting something outside existing process flow, possibly requiring new activities, which is not allowed.
- No mention of reconnection of flows or reuse of Task_Triage as required.

This answer misunderstands timer event placement and slightly violates constraints on introducing new elements/handlers, warranting a low score.
