### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, and metrics)**: Full match. The three activities (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) are accurately identified and ranked by average waiting time. Both average and 95th-percentile times are quoted verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5h/120h, etc.). No mention of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities. (10/10)
- **Format and constraints**: Memo-like structure with header is appropriate for an "executive memo," and word count is well under 150 (~120 words). Concise and focused. (9/10; minor deduction for not mirroring ground truth's ultra-minimalist list format exactly.)
- **Actions**: Partial compliance. All recommendations are concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for documents, workflow integration for letters, triage for assessment). The first explicitly promises ≥20% reduction. However, the second and third lack any explicit ≥20% commitment or quantification (e.g., no "cut by X%" phrasing), violating the prompt's strict requirement. Additionally, none are clearly "data-driven" (ground truth includes specifics like "pilot tests show ≥25%," "estimated 30%," "targeting 20-25%"; LLM's are generic proposals without evidence or estimates, appearing unsubstantiated). This is a significant shortfall under strict evaluation. (4/10)

Overall, strong on facts but critically weak on action specificity and data-driven rigor, leading to notable divergence from ground truth.
