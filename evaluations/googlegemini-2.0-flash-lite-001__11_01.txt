### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three worst activities (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) are identified correctly based on average waiting time from the table. Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim without alteration or inclusion of service times/executions/throughput. No extraneous activities or metrics discussed. (+10% weight, full points)
  
- **Format and Structure**: Crisp memo style with header, under 150 words (~90 words). Ranks explicitly (#1–#3). Aligns with "executive memo" intent, though ground truth is more list-like and concise. Minor deduction for added arbitrary date/subject without strict necessity, but not a major deviation. (+20% weight, 95% alignment → -0.1)

- **Actions (concrete, data-driven, ≥20% cut)**: Each action is concrete and logically tied to waiting-time reduction (automation for documents/letters, module for assessment). No unsupported inventions beyond table data. However, strict shortfall: No explicit mention of ≥20% reduction per action (only vague "significantly" at end); lacks specific data-backing (e.g., no "pilot tests," "estimated," or % like ground truth's ≥25%/30%/20–25%). "Data-backed" claim is unsubstantiated in text, reducing "data-driven" fidelity. Significant loss for these omissions under utmost strictness. (+70% weight, 75% alignment → -1.8)

Overall: Strong core compliance but penalized heavily for action precision gaps versus ground truth, per strict instructions.
