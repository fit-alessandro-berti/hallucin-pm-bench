The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No"), fulfills the task by citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001, C002, C003, C004) with accurate activity sequences, and provides a clear justification highlighting counterexamples (C002 and C004) where intervening activities occur. This directly refutes the "always" claim. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's tabular structure and explicit violation count (e.g., "two out of four"), which adds precision but is not strictly required by the prompt; however, the content is factually identical and comprehensive.
