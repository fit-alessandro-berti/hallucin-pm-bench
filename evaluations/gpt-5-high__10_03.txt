4.5

Assessment:

**Vocabulary Policy Compliance (Major Issue):**
- The LLM answer mostly uses the correct vocabulary (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”), **but fails on activity names**:
  - It introduces "Escalate for Compliance Officer approval" (which is not a described activity, nor is it properly named, as the activity should be strictly "Compliance Officer Approval").
  - It uses "Schedule the payment" and "Release the funds and notify the originating analyst", which do not correspond exactly to the ground truth activities "Release Funds". "Schedule the payment" is not an authorized activity and "Release the funds and notify..." is an amalgamation.
- The LLM answer correctly **does not use disallowed synonyms**.

**Activity Set (Major Issue):**
- The LLM answer **adds/merges/renames activities**:
  - "Escalate for Compliance Officer approval" is an extraneous step, not present as a named activity in the ground truth; escalation is a process condition, not an activity to assign RACI.
  - "Compliance Officer Approval" is split into two rows -- "Escalate..." and "Compliance Officer approval".
  - "Schedule the payment" is not an activity in the ground truth.
  - "Release the funds and notify the originating analyst" is a merged/extended activity; it is strictly "Release Funds" in the ground truth.

**RACI Assignments (Significant Issues):**
- **Intake Vetting**: Missing "Consulted" (C) for Compliance Analyst and "Informed" (I) for Treasury Ops.
- **KYC Review, AML Screening**: Missing "C" for Compliance Officer and "I" for Treasury Ops.
- **Risk Scoring**: Misses "Consulted" for Front-Office Analyst, "Accountable" assigned incorrectly (should be Compliance Officer), "Informed" missing for Treasury Ops, Compliance Analyst incorrectly given both "R, A".
- **Compliance Officer Approval**: Split incorrectly; assignments wrong.
- **Release Funds**: Front-Office and Compliance Analyst should be "Informed" and "Consulted" respectively, not "Informed" only. Activity also improperly merged.

**Formatting:**
- Correct Markdown use, but key for non-involved roles ("–") is replaced by blanks.

**Conclusion:**
- The answer shows some understanding of the correct terms but structurally and procedurally diverges from the ground truth in both activity naming and RACI mapping.
- Significant deduction for not matching the activity names/structure (which the prompt prohibits) and for multiple RACI assignment errors.
- Small plus for avoiding forbidden synonyms.

**Hence, strict score: 4.5/10.**
