2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer violates the prompt's strict instructions in multiple ways, leading to a low score under utmost strictness. Key issues:

- **Activity Handling (Major Violation, -4.0 points)**: The prompt mandates covering *every activity* from the narrative *without renaming, merging, or adding*. The ground truth derives exactly 6 activities by mapping narrative steps to authorized terms (e.g., "Preliminary Assessment" → "Intake Vetting"; escalation/approval → "Compliance Officer Approval"; release/notify → "Release Funds"). The LLM adds 4 unauthorized activities ("Escalate for Compliance Officer approval", "Compliance Officer approval", "Schedule the payment", "Release the funds and notify the originating analyst"), renames others (e.g., verbose "Release..." vs. concise "Release Funds"), and granularly splits steps that ground truth merges. This is not faithful to the narrative and directly contravenes the rule, creating extraneous rows.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Violation, -2.5 points)**: Assignments diverge significantly from ground truth across nearly all cells (e.g., Intake Vetting: LLM gives R,A to Front-Office and I to Compliance, but ground truth adds C to Compliance and I to Treasury; Risk Scoring: LLM assigns R,A solely to Compliance, but ground truth splits R to Compliance, A to Officer, and C to Front-Office). No cell matches perfectly, indicating misinterpretation of responsibilities (e.g., ignoring consultations/informations like Treasury's I in early steps or Officer's A in scoring).

- **Formatting and Details (Minor but Strict Deductions, -1.0 points)**: Lacks ground truth's bolding for activities and key R,A entries. Uses blank cells instead of "–" for no involvement (e.g., many empty spots in LLM vs. explicit "–" in ground truth). Headers lack alignment with ground truth's spacing/emphasis. No explanatory notes, though not required.

- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +0.0 from base)**: Correctly uses the 4 mandated terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", etc.) without synonyms or leaks—aligns with the key points for the judge. However, this is insufficient to offset structural failures.

Base score starts at 10.0; deductions reflect differences from ground truth (more differences = lower score). Total adherence is ~25% (vocab only), justifying 2.5. Even small formatting errors compound under strictness, but core issues dominate.
