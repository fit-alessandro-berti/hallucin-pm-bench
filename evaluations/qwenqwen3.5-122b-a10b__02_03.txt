- Q1: Minor deduction for omitting case list (ground truth includes "(C123, C456, C789)"), though question asks only "how many" and "3" is correct/concise.  
- Q2/Q3: Exact match in content ("Pack_Items", "Cancel_Order"); minor format diff (no bold/labels, underscore escape irrelevant).  
- Overall: Highly accurate, follows "concise bullet-point" instruction perfectly; strictness applied only to explicit diffs.
