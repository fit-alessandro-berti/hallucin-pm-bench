9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It lists all added and removed tasks under the correct headings and accurately describes the gateway-type change, using the entity names and the transition from exclusive to inclusive. Minor deductions:

- It uses the names as presented in XML rather than in the full format shown in the ground truth (but this matches the user's request to ignore cosmetic renamings, so this is not strictly an error).
- For the "Approve Loan" â†’ "Auto-Approve Loan" task, the LLM correctly does not list this as an addition/removal (as per instructions to ignore renames).
- In the "Gateway-type changes" heading, the LLM's summary is concise but it lacks the additional "from XOR to OR" explanatory note found in the ground truth.

Given these are extremely minor issues (mostly stylistic rather than substantive), the answer deserves a 9.0. It cannot receive a perfect 10.0 due to the slight lack of detail in the gateway-type change description.
