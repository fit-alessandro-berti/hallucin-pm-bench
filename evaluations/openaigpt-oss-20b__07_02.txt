### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the ground truth on core content. No factual errors in what was added/removed/changed, and it adheres to the required headings without extraneous information. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Formatting inconsistencies (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: Uses bullet points (-) instead of numbered lists (1., 2., etc.); reverses order (ID first, then name) vs. ground truth (name bold first, then (ID)); bold headings vs. italicized; lacks the "## **Expected Answer Key**" prefix and closing parenthetical note. These are small but cumulative structural deviations.
  
- **Gateway details incomplete (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: Omits explanatory abbreviations (XOR/OR), version references (*v1* to *v2*), and full phrasing ("changed from...in *v1* to...in *v2*"); uses em dash (â€‘) instead of colon or escaped underscore. This misses nuance present in ground truth.

- **Minor stylistic issues (-0.5 point)**: Backticks around IDs (unnecessary in ground truth's parentheses style); no bolding of task names.

Overall, the answer is substantively accurate (80% match) but loses points for not mirroring the ground truth's precise structure, detail, and presentation, as required by strict evaluation criteria.
