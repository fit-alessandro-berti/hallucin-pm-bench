The LLM answer misplaces the timer on the Start_Claim event instead of a boundary timer on Task_Receive, fails to specify an interrupting boundary timer with proper duration syntax (PT48H), and incorrectly routes the escalation flow to Task_Assign, bypassing Task_Triage entirelyâ€”this directly violates the SLA requiring claims to reach Triage within 48 hours. While it references IDs and stays concise/under word limit, the core suggestion undermines the business rule, introducing a logical error that prevents SLA compliance. Minor positives for intent and no new tasks, but strict evaluation demands severe deduction for these inaccuracies.
