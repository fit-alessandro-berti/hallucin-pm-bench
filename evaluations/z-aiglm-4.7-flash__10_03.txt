**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment against ground truth):
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no synonyms or leaks. No deductions here.
- **Activities (major errors, -3.0)**: Covers the 4 mandated + 2 more (matching GT's 6 total), but **adds unauthorized "Schedule Payment"** (not in GT; narrative implies but GT merges/omits as separate). Renames final activity as "Release Funds and Notify" vs. GT's "Release Funds" (merge error, violates "do not rename, merge").
- **RACI assignments (severe mismatches, -3.0)**: ~70% of cells differ:
  | Activity | Matching cells | Errors |
  |----------|----------------|--------|
  | Intake Vetting | Front **R,A** | Misses Comp. Analyst **C**, Treas. **I**; Comp. Off. blank vs. **–** |
  | KYC Review | Comp. Analyst **R,A** | Misses Comp. Off. **C**, Treas. **I**; Front blank vs. **–** |
  | AML Screening | Comp. Analyst **R,A** | Misses Comp. Off. **C**, Treas. **I**; Front blank vs. **–** |
  | Risk Scoring | None | Entirely wrong (Comp. Analyst **R,A** vs. Front **C**, Comp. Analyst **R**, Comp. Off. **A**, Treas. **I**) |
  | Comp. Off. Approval | Comp. Analyst **C**, Comp. Off. **R,A** | Misses Front **I**; Treas. blank vs. **–** |
  | Schedule Payment | N/A | Extra/unauthorized row |
  | Release Funds(and Notify) | Front **I**, Treas. **R,A** | Name mismatch; misses Comp. Analyst **C**, Comp. Off. **C** |
- **Formatting/structure (minor but strict deductions, -1.0)**: Blanks vs. GT's **–** for no involvement (inconsistent). Extra unauthorized **Legend**. Simpler Markdown (no column-width dashes for alignment). Bolded cells match, but overall not identical.
- **Overall fidelity**: ~30% cell/row match; interpretive RACI heavily diverges from GT despite narrative. Strict policy: small errors (e.g., blanks vs. –) + cumulative mismatches = major loss. No 10.0 (not identical); caps at low score.
