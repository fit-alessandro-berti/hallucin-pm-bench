4.2

### Key Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Correct Identification of Top 3 Activities (jointly SLA breach + high wait)**: Correctly selects Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment (+1.5). Order roughly matches (Legal/Risk tie on breach magnitude, Legal higher wait).
- **Quantification of SLA Exceeds**: Fundamentally flawed (-3.5). Uses *waiting time* vs. throughput time for SLA comparison (wrong metric per table/SLA intent). Errors: Legal (0s vs. true +300s throughput), Risk (+180s vs. +300s), Credit (+40s vs. +60s, and 200s <240s so no exceed on wait). Ignores throughput entirely.
- **Recommendations**: Generic, non-data-driven inventions ("automated workflows", "increase capacity", "detailed analysis") violating "ground in data" (-1.8). Not concrete/specific like ground truth (e.g., no case volumes, peaks, thresholds tied to data).
- **Structure/Format**: Violates "bullet points *only* for recommendations" with numbered list for activities (-0.5). Adds extraneous greeting/closing/signature ("Dear COO", "Regards") vs. "only memo text" (-0.3). No subject/headers like ground truth.
- **Fidelity to Instructions**: ~120 words (under 150, minor -0.2). No invented activities/metrics obeyed, but sentences not fully grounded (e.g., recs ungrounded).
- **Overall Style/Executiveness**: Lacks ground truth's precision (total cases ~4805 implied sum, projections), reads as amateur (-0.5).
