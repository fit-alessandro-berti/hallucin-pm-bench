7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all the functional changes (added tasks, removed tasks, gateway type changes) and lists them under the required headings. However, there are several formatting issues compared to the ground truth:

- Headings are preceded by dashes and trailing spaces, while the prompt requires the headings to appear verbatim with no markup or trailing spaces.
- Items in each section are not preceded by hyphens, as shown in the ground truth.
- Gateway changes are not aligned or spaced as in the ground truth (second gateway line missing indentation).
- The answer is technically correct but deviates from the required output format, which the instructions say should be reflected in significant point loss even for small errors.

These issues warrant a substantial deduction, leading to a 7.0 rather than a higher score.
