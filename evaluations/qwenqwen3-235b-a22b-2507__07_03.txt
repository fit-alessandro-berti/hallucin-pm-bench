The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact IDs, names, and gateway type transitions, matching the ground truth content verbatim. However, under utmost strictness, it loses 1.0 point for formatting discrepancies: headings include extraneous leading dashes ("- ADDED TASKS" vs. plain "ADDED TASKS"), and list items lack the leading dashes present in the ground truth (e.g., "Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)" vs. "- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)"). The ground truth's extra alignment spaces in the second gateway entry are not replicated, but this is minor compared to the structural mismatches.
