The LLM answer is semantically perfect, accurately identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel; Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel) with exact IDs, names, and formats matching the prompt's specifications and examples. No extra commentary, no unchanged elements mentioned, headings verbatim and in order.

Minor formatting differences from ground truth deduct 1.0 point under utmost strictness:
- Missing leading "- " bullet on all 6 list items (3 added, 1 removed, 2 gateways).
- Missing alignment padding spaces after ":" in second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").

These are small visual/textual discrepancies but warrant significant deduction per instructions.
