### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using the exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without any forbidden variants, and it structures a basic RACI matrix with the specified activities as rows and roles as columns, without introducing extra tasks, roles, or unwarranted content. The legend is a minor addition but not explicitly prohibited. However, under strict evaluation, the RACI allocations deviate significantly from the ground truth in multiple cells, failing to accurately reflect the narrative's implications (e.g., exactly one Responsible per activity is maintained, but Accountable roles for AM are mishandled, and Consulted/Informed assignments are incorrect in key areas). Specific errors include:

- **Receive Application**: CO assigned I (should be C) – incorrect consultation.
- **KYC Review**: AM C (should be A); CO A/R (should be R, extra A); FC I (should be C) – major swaps and extras.
- **Order Vetting**: Minor notation difference (A/R vs. R/A), but functionally matches.
- **Payment Clearance**: All assignments wrong (AM I vs. A; CO I vs. C; FC A/R vs. R; IT C vs. I) – complete mismatch, including extra A for FC and misplaced C.
- **Record Update**: IT A/R (should be R) – unwarranted extra A.
- **Notify Customer**: Matches functionally.

These represent ~5-6 cell-level differences (out of 24), plus notation inconsistencies (A/R vs. R/A or **R / A**), violating the "reflect the narrative" criterion. No self-awareness issues apply. With utmost strictness, even partial matches (e.g., extra A implying unearned accountability) warrant significant deductions, yielding a low score despite terminology compliance.
