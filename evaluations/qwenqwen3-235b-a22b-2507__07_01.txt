• The LLM answer listed all factual differences and grouped them under the correct headings.

• However, it did not use the **exact element names as they appear in the XML** for the added/removed tasks—element IDs are missing (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`).  
• For the gateway change, the LLM did not use the required formatting (i.e., backticks and bold), nor did it specify the IDs in code style as in the ground truth.

• The LLM also used dash lists instead of bullet or star lists, and didn’t bold the headings or answers per the ground truth style.  
• Though the factual information is correct, these presentation errors and not adhering to the required format or including element IDs are significant and warrant a point reduction.

• No extraneous changes or speculations were made.

Overall: significant loss of points for formatting and not including IDs, but all facts were accurate.
