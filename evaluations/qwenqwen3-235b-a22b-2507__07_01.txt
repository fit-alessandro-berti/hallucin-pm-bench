The LLM answer correctly identifies the added tasks (using exact names from XML), removed task (exact name), and gateway change (using the ID and factual type shift), with no speculation or extra differences reported. However, it loses points for omitting the task IDs (present in ground truth for precise XML referencing), minor phrasing differences in the gateway description (lacks version indicators), and slight formatting variances (bullets and headings), which constitute small but notable deviations under strict evaluation criteria.
