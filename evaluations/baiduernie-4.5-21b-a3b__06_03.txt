The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks associated with the two parallel splits in Process B, listing exactly the same tasks for each set as the ground truth. The order, grouping, and content are all precise. The only slight deviation is that the answer adds Chinese translations for the tasks in parentheses, which is not part of the ground truth and constitutes minor additional information. Also, there is a heading sentence ("以下是按顺序列出的...") that restates the prompt in Chinese, which is unnecessary since the instructions called for strict focus and only listing the sets, as in the ground truth. These small differences result in a small deduction, but the answer is otherwise accurate and complete.
