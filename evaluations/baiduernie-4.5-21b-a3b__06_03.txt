6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Content Accuracy (Strong Match, +8 points base)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B (Quality_Check with Update_Inventory in the first parallel block; Generate_Replenishment_Report with Notify_Procurement in the second). It numbers them sequentially as required and focuses solely on Process B without mentioning A or C.
- **Language Mismatch (Major Deduction, -2.5 points)**: The entire response is in Chinese, while the prompt and ground truth are in English. This introduces unnecessary translations (e.g., "质量检验") and rephrasing (e.g., "并行构造的不同分支上"), deviating significantly from the ground truth's English-only format.
- **Formatting and Wording Differences (Moderate Deduction, -1.0 point)**: Uses bullet points, bolded split names, and descriptive Chinese phrases (e.g., "**Parallel Split #1** 的分支上可并发执行") instead of the ground truth's concise "Set 1 – first parallel block:" with ‖ symbol. This adds verbosity not present in the ground truth.
- **Missing Element (Minor Deduction, -0.5 point)**: Omits the ground truth's explicit "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," though the prompt doesn't strictly require it—still a small completeness gap under strict evaluation.
- **No Extraneous Errors**: No factual inaccuracies, hallucinations, or off-topic content.

Overall, the response is semantically identical in identifying the required sets but loses points for presentation and language issues, resulting in a strict mid-range score.
