9.2

The LLM answer is factually perfect (correct Yes/No, accurate rule assessments, precise violation identification matching the trace), with justifications directly referencing each rule as required. Minor deductions for: (1) format mismatch (bullets vs. ground truth table, -0.4); (2) slightly less explicit phrasing in Rule 2 (omits restating "Severity is High" in reasoning, -0.2); (3) Rule 3 reasoning less verbose/precise on "both QE and RA are finished" (-0.1); (4) trivial wording variances like "not compliant" vs. "non-compliant" and opening statement brevity (-0.1). Under utmost strictness, these stylistic differences warrant the deduction despite semantic equivalence.
