9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). No deductions.
- **Question 2**: Perfect match (5.56% with correct calculation). No deductions.
- **Question 3**: Near-perfect match (identifies A1002 correctly; minor phrasing difference from "only case A1002" but no factual deviation). No deductions.
- **Question 4**: Partial match. "Small Sample Size" fully aligns with one ideal reason (clearly stated with reference to 18 lines and variance). However, "Bias" is a vague, generic catch-all that loosely touches on representativeness (e.g., distribution across cases/times) but does not clearly state any of the other specific ideal reasons (Temporal bias, Case-mix bias, or Survivorship/truncation bias). Lacks the precision and direct derivation from the log fragment expected in the ground truth examples (e.g., no mention of the short time window, four cases, or potential omission of high-risk events). Significant deduction for this imprecision under strict criteria: 7.0/10 for this question.

Overall score reflects near-excellence in factual accuracy and adherence to the log data (no hallucinations), but penalized for Q4's lack of specificity in the second reason, as even minor deviations in reasoning quality warrant notable point loss.
