The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a valid short justification with evidence from Cases 1001 and 1003, accurately noting the reversed ordering in 1001. However, it omits Case 1002 entirely, where the absence of "Update_Inventory" directly disproves the "always" claimâ€”a critical piece of evidence highlighted in the ground truth. Additionally, for Case 1003, it focuses only on "Authorize_Refund" being final without explicitly noting the preceding "Update_Inventory" (as the ground truth does), making the justification less comprehensive. Under strict evaluation, these omissions represent significant differences in evidential coverage, warranting a deduction despite the overall correctness of the verdict.
