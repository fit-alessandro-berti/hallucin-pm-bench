7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
**Question 1 (Accuracy: Perfect match)**: The LLM correctly identifies the exact count of 1 occurrence for "Manual Fraud Check" (CaseID 1002), aligning verbatim with the ground truth. No errors.

**Question 2 (Explanation Quality)**: The LLM stays under 120 words and captures key themes like small sample size, sampling risks, label variability, and need for full data—mirroring the ground truth's focus on tiny excerpts distorting rare event estimates. Strengths: Bullet-point structure aids clarity; references data examples (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check"). However, strict deductions for:
- **Speculation beyond data**: Introduces unsubstantiated claims like "~0.001% of a month’s volume" (no full-log volume provided), clustering in "high-risk periods," omitted "rejected applications," and "weekend vs. weekday patterns" (data is only March 1st, no day-of-week info). Ground truth avoids this, sticking to observable snippet limits (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours).
- **Missed statistical precision**: Omits ground truth's core insight on frequency volatility (0% to 7% swing per event, wide confidence intervals, extreme sampling error for rares)—replaced with vaguer "sampling bias" and "statistically invalid."
- **Label example inaccuracy**: Hypothesizes "*“Fraud Check (Manual)”*" (not in data), while ground truth cites actual variants like "Fraud Check (Automatic)."
These deviations inflate wordiness with non-data elements, reducing fidelity (~20-25% content divergence). Overall score reflects strong conceptual overlap but penalizes speculation and omissions under utmost strictness.
