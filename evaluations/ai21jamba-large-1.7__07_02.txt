9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifying all added and removed tasks as well as appropriately describing the gateway-type change. However, there are minor differences that should result in a one-point deduction under strict grading:

1. The LLM includes short functional descriptions of the newly added tasks ("Verifies the identity...", etc.), which go beyond the required format of strictly listing under the prescribed headings without such embellishments.
2. In the **Gateway-type changes** section, the LLM includes some interpretive commentary ("This change reflects a broader decision-making process..."), which is unnecessary and not part of the requested strict summary.

Otherwise, the technical content matches the ground truth perfectly: all headings are correct, all tasks and gateway changes are correctly identified, and no superfluous changes are included.

**Deduction summary:**
- -0.5 for additional textual explanation under "Added Tasks"
- -0.5 for unnecessary interpretive note at the end

This results in a robust 9.0.
