**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and directly follows the task format (numbered 1 and 2). It correctly identifies "No" and justifies with precise counterexamples (C002, C004 sequences), explicitly notes where it holds (C001, C003) to address "always," and cites relevant CaseIDs/sequences from the log with no errors or omissions. Differences from ground truth are purely stylistic (text vs. table); semantic content, logic, and evidence match exactly.
