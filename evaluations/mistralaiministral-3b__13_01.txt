- The LLM answer is very strong:  
    - **Q1:** Correct, "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs exactly 1 time.
    - **Q2:** Total event count (18) and calculation/percentage (5.56%) are precisely correct and match ground truth. 
    - **Q3:** The case identifier is correct ("A1002").
    - **Q4:** The answer gives "Small Sample Size" (correct, explained well) and "Lack of Temporal Distribution."  
      - This is acceptably phrased, corresponding to "Temporal bias" in ground truth: the LLM explicitly notes the range is only a single day and not necessarily representative of monthly frequency.
    - Minor stylistic differences, e.g., "Lack of temporal distribution" rather than "temporal bias," do not misstate the underlying logic.

**Strictness & Deductions:**
- The LLM's rationale for Q4 omits mention of e.g., "case-mix bias" or "truncation/survivorship bias" but those were only examples in the ground truthâ€”any two valid sampling-related concerns suffice. Both provided reasons are direct, correct, and tied only to what's observable in the fragment.

- The LLM answer sometimes slightly loosens phrasing (e.g., "makes the estimate highly susceptible..." rather than "high variance; one more occurrence would change the % by..."), but no incorrect or extraneous inference or information appears.

**Loss of 1 point:** For not specifying "morning" or time-range as precisely (single day, not specifically the morning period) as in the ground truth, and for not giving a precise percentage-point effect for "small sample size" (though the fundamental concept is stated and explained appropriately).

**Conclusion:** No factual inaccuracies, no unjustified inferences, fully aligned with instructions to only use explicit data, and clear answers to all questions. Minor differences in wording cost 1 point.
