The LLM answer is fully correct, with no factual errors, and adheres to the prompt's request for concise bullet-point answers. Minor formatting differences (e.g., lack of explicit labeling as A1/A2/A3, no enumeration of case names, and no backslash escaping in activity names) do not detract from accuracy or completeness.
