9.5

- The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It answers each question concisely and correctly:

  1. "3" corresponds to "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" (just less explicit, but correct).
  2. "Pack_Items" matches the expected answer exactly.
  3. "Cancel_Order" matches the expected answer exactly.

- The only tiny deduction is for not spelling out the actual case IDs in the first answer, resulting in a slight loss of explicitness/clarity, but there is no error in the count itself.
