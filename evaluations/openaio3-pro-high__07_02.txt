The LLM answer accurately identifies all required changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the exact gateway type change) with no factual errors or omissions in content, fully adhering to the prompt's focus on tasks and gateways while ignoring renamings. However, under utmost strictness, deductions apply for minor presentation differences: reversed order of ID/name in listings (ID first vs. name first), bullet points instead of numbered lists, plain headings instead of bolded markdown, lack of XOR/OR terminology and version references (*v1*/*v2*) in the gateway description, and absence of the confirmatory note on no other changesâ€”resulting in a near-perfect but not identical match to the ground truth format and detail level.
