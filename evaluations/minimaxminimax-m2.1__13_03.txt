7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1 (40% weight)**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). Minor deduction (-0.1) for extraneous details (case/timestamp) beyond minimal "1" in ground truth, per strictness on fidelity.
- **Q2 (60% weight)**: Strong on sample size (14 events/3 cases) and rarity issues (7.1% ≈ ground truth's 7%). Word count compliant (118 ≤120). However, significant deviations: 
  - Introduces speculation ("thousands of cases", "high-risk applications", "seasonal patterns", full-month extrapolation)—violates "no speculation" policy (major -1.5).
  - Misses core ground truth points: sampling error/confidence interval quantification ("swings from 0% to 7%"), time span (<2 hours), near-synonyms/"strict vs fuzzy matching" distortion (-1.2).
  - Adds non-ground-truth concepts (selection bias, case routes bypassing) as primary explanation (-0.6).
- Overall: Content ~70% aligned; strict penalty for differences/speculation yields 7.2 (not 10 due to key omissions/additions; not <5 as core logic sound).
