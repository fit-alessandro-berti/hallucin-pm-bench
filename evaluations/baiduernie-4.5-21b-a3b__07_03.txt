The LLM answer identifies all three added tasks and correctly notes the gateway type change for `Gateway_ReviewNeeded`. However, it fails to:

- List the removed task (`Task_ManualReview`), which is a significant omission.
- Note the gateway type change for `Gateway_Payment`, which switched from exclusive to parallel.
- Use the requested dash "-" formatting for lists (minor, but required).
- It also inappropriately writes "None" under REMOVED TASKS instead of the actual removed task.

These errors and omissions mean the answer misses both concrete required elements and formatting detail, warranting a strict penalty.
