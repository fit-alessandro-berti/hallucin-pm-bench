### Evaluation Rationale
- **ADDED TASKS**: Fully correct in content (all 3 tasks identified with id and name in parentheses). Minor formatting differences (backticks and no bullet points) result in a small deduction, but content matches.
- **REMOVED TASKS**: Completely incorrect—misses the verifiable removal of `Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)` from v1 to v2. Stating "None" is a major error, as this is a clear functional change.
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: Partially correct (identifies the change for `Gateway_ReviewNeeded`), but misses the second verifiable change for `Gateway_Payment` (exclusive → parallel). This omission halves the accuracy of the section.
- **Overall**: Under strict criteria, the response omits two critical differences (1 removal + 1 gateway change) out of 6 total items in ground truth, leading to substantial point loss despite correct partial coverage. Formatting inconsistencies (bold headings, backticks, no dashes) add minor penalties, but content errors dominate. No extraneous commentary, which is positive.
