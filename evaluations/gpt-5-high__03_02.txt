4.0

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure (full BPMN 2.0 JSON with definitions, flowElements, messages vs. simplified custom {process_id, elements, flows}), inventing an extra "Parse E-mail" task (ground truth combines parsing/creation into "Create Ticket"), misplacing the parallel fork (after resolution to send/log/join/await vs. after send to await/log/join), using detailed BPMN types (e.g., UserTask, SendTask, EventSubProcess) vs. generic "task"/"event", differing cancellation modeling (event subprocess with interrupt vs. loose intermediate catch to terminate), varied names (e.g., "Wait for Reply or 24h" vs. "Wait 24h for Reply"; "Simple" vs. "simple"), and extraneous details (e.g., messageRefs, timeDuration, flow IDs). While no escalations are added and core flows are present, these structural, additive, and placement errors warrant a low score under strict evaluation.
