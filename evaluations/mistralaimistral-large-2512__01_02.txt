### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiencies, ~50% of grade weight)**: LLM identifies only 2/3 points (omits **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** entirely, despite GT explicitly listing it as the third with "board votes **Approve** or **Reject**"). No mention of contextual positions ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). Omits specific underwriter names ("Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B"). Phrasing deviations (e.g., "> 2 points" vs. precise "≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else ⇒ ... tie-break"; "proceed to" vs. "send to"; "€15,000" comma vs. "€15 000" space). No italicized conditional structure as in GT. Severe incompleteness warrants ~70% deduction here.
- **Required Documents (Minor but Cumulative Errors, ~30% weight)**: Lists all 6 correctly but deviates in phrasing/formatting vs. GT: adds "single" and "or" ("single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"); adds "template" ("(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"); "≤ 3 months old" vs. "(≤ 3 months)"; unnecessary bolding/emphasis. Omits GT's closing note ("*(No credit bureau...)*"). Numbered boldly vs. GT plain list. Strict nitpicks deduct ~40%.
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity (20% weight)**: Good separation/titles but introduces unrequested "**" emphasis, "---" divider, and capitalization inconsistencies (e.g., "€15,000"). Fails "exact terminology" by minor rephrasings. No intro of standard terms, but not faithful enough to GT.
- **Net**: Major omission + small errors = low score. Perfect match required for 10; this is ~30% accurate under strict criteria.
