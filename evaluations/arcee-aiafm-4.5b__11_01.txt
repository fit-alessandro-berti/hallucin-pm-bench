2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (Major Deduction: -5.0 points)**: Only #1 activity (Request_Documents) is correctly identified with verbatim waiting times (36.5h avg, 120.0h p95). #2 (Submit_Claim) and #3 (Approve_Payment) are grossly incorrect; worst by waiting time are #2 Send_Closure_Letter (12.2h avg, 44.0h p95) and #3 Assess_Liability (7.8h avg, 16.4h p95). Ranking violates the core "strictly by waiting-time" criterion, introducing non-worst activities.
- **No Unwarranted Content (Minor Gain: +1.0 point)**: Avoids service-time, throughput, or unlisted activities. No extraneous metrics, but includes irrelevant sections (e.g., "Next Steps") not in ground truth or prompt, slightly bloating structure.
- **Action Relevance (Minor Deduction: -1.5 points)**: Actions are concrete and claim ≥20% reduction, but not data-driven (no pilots, tests, or estimates like ground truth's "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%"). Tied to wrong activities, undermining logic.
- **Format & Constraints (Minor Gain: +2.0 points)**: Memo-like structure with ranking; under 150 words (~120). Crisp but deviates from ground truth's concise, bullet-free style.
- **Overall Strictness**: Core failures in activity selection/ ranking (prompt's primary task) warrant severe penalty despite partial adherence. Ground truth alignment is ~25% (only #1 matches).
