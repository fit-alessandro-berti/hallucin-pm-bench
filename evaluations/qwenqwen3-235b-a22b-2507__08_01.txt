7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer reaches the correct conclusion ("Yes") and provides a valid, minimal concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, fulfilling the prompt's requirements. The justification accurately describes T5's enabling condition (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0 via inhibitor arc) and why it's possible before T3 fires, aligning with the ground truth's core logic.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Structural messiness and initial error (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: The response begins with an incorrect "No" and a flawed "proof of impossibility" that self-contradicts and flips mid-way, showing confused reasoning. This undermines clarity and reliability, even though it corrects itself—small errors like this must reflect substantial loss.
- **Lack of depth and completeness (-1.0 point)**: The justification is brief but omits key ground truth insights, such as T5 *must* fire before T3 (if at all) due to the inhibitor arc's permanent effect after T3 (p4 never empties without T4), and no extended sequence (e.g., to T4) is shown. It stops at the minimal sequence without exploring implications.
- **Minor presentation issues (-0.0 additional, as not penalizing further)**: Repetition and formatting (e.g., "Wait!" interjections) make it less polished, but the core content is sound.

Overall match to ground truth: ~75% (strong on facts/sequence, weak on precision, reasoning flow, and nuance), justifying 7.5/10.0.
