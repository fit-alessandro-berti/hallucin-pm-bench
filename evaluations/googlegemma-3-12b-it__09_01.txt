The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core conclusion (impossibility of computation due to missing timestamps/durations) and structure (direct response to Q1, reasoning for Q2). It accurately reflects the data limitations, uses prompt-appropriate terminology ("cycle time" and "Review Contract"), and avoids fabrication, fulfilling the system instruction. Minor deductions for not explicitly mentioning "ordering information," "temporal value per event," or the risk of "fabricated" answers, which adds slight completeness to the ground truth's reasoning.
