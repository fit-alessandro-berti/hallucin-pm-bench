**3.0**

Major differences from ground truth: incorrect attachment point (`Task_RequestDocs` vs. `Task_Receive`), wrong timer specification (absolute `timeDate` from `Start_Claim` vs. relative `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H>`), different event ID (`BE_48h` vs. `Timer_48h`), extraneous "escalation flag/event" detail, and focus on "docs pending/main delay point" vs. general bypass. These alter the core suggestion, fail to match XML style/precision, and risk SLA gaps (e.g., LLM misses delays before `RequestDocs`). Similarities (interrupting timer to `Task_Triage`, no new tasks) warrant minimal credit under strict criteria.
