**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, +2.0 base)**: Uses exactly the 4 mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no synonyms, leaks, or variations. No disallowed terms appear.
- **Activities (major failure, -5.0)**: 
  - Covers only 4 mandated + 1 unauthorized addition ("Payment Scheduling", violating "do not add activities").
  - Misses 2 critical activities from narrative/GT ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds").
  - Merges/escalates incorrectly (e.g., no separation of scheduling/release/approval).
- **RACI assignments (major failure, -2.0)**: Almost entirely incorrect vs. GT:
  | Activity                  | Key LLM errors vs. GT |
  |---------------------------|-----------------------|
  | Intake Vetting            | Missing A (Front), C (Comp Analyst), I (Treasury); blanks ≠ –/involvement. |
  | KYC Review                | Missing A (Comp Analyst), C (Officer), I (Treasury). |
  | AML Screening             | Completely wrong (Treasury R); should be Comp Analyst R/A + others. |
  | Risk Scoring              | Partial (Comp R, Officer A); missing Front C, Treasury I. |
  | Payment Scheduling (extra)| Unauthorized; no GT match. |
  | Missing rows              | Zero coverage for Approval/Release. |
- **Format/Table (minor errors, -1.0)**: No bolds on activities/roles, blanks instead of –, imperfect alignment; not matching GT structure precisely.
- **Coverage of every activity/role (failure, -0.0 additional)**: Does not fully cover narrative (e.g., escalation, release, notify).

Total: Perfect vocab cannot offset ~80% content mismatch, wrong/missing activities, and RACI errors. Strict penalty for all deviations.
