The LLM answer is highly accurate, directly addressing the user's two-part query with a clear statement that the value cannot be derived, and providing a precise explanation aligned with the ground truth. It correctly identifies the absence of temporal data (timestamps/elapsed times) as the core issue, notes the irrelevance of historical benchmarks (an accurate extra detail not contradicted by the ground truth), and avoids any fabrication. Phrasing and structure are appropriate, with only negligible stylistic differences from the ground truth (e.g., explicit numbering for the response parts, which matches the prompt's format). No errors or deviations warrant point deduction under strict evaluation.
