10.0

The LLM answer is perfectly aligned with the ground truth answer:

- It explicitly states that the requested value cannot be derived due to lack of timestamps or elapsed-time fields.
- It accurately notes that the necessary data (timestamps, durations) is missing, making the calculation impossible.
- It recognizes that no relevant historical benchmark applies to "Review Contract."
- Both the direct answer and the explanation mirror the essential content and reasoning of the ground truth response.

There are no discrepancies or missing points; even small differences are absent. Thus, a strict evaluation yields a full score.
