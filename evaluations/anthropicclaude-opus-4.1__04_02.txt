5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification accurate and concise (under 20 words). No deduction.
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. ground truth Violated). Justification flawed, as it ignores the Change_Request triggering a new approval on 2025-03-07, making Ship_Goods non-compliant relative to the final approval. Major error; significant deduction.
- **R3**: Status matches (Violated). Justification accurate. No deduction.
- **R4**: Status matches (Not Applicable). Justification accurate. No deduction.
- **R5**: Status matches (Violated). Justification partially accurate but incomplete (focuses only on Ship_Goods; omits Pay_Invoice as a further step before new approval). Minor error, but strictness requires deduction.
- **R6**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification accurate. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT). No deduction.
- **General Notes**: Format follows prompt (status + justification per rule, conclusion). However, the critical R2 mismatch and R5 incompleteness indicate substantial deviations from ground truth, warranting a mid-low score under strict criteria.
