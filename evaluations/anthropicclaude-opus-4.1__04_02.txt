7.0

Rationale for scoring:
- R1: Correct – both in status and concise justification.
- R6: Correct – both in status and concise justification.
- R3 and R5: Correct status and clear, proper justification per trace.
- R4: Correctly flagged Not Applicable with correct reasoning.
- R2: **Error—should be Violated.** The LLM considers the "last required approval" for Ship_Goods to be Finance_Approval (2025-03-04), but because there was a Change_Request after approvals, the rule (per R5) requires Manager_Approval again before any further processing. Ship_Goods happened before the new Manager_Approval (2025-03-07), making the relevant “last required approval” actually the new Manager_Approval, so Ship_Goods was not within 2 days after it. Thus, calling R2 "Compliant" is incorrect.
- Additionally, in R5 justification, the LLM omits mentioning that Pay_Invoice (event 7) also occurred before new Manager_Approval; according to the format, it should name any "processing step" (not just Ship_Goods), so this is a slight lack of completeness.

Despite these errors, the structure is almost perfect and the rule analysis is mostly correct, with clear justifications. R2 is a significant error (and deserves heavy deduction), with a minor one for incomplete R5 justification, yielding a score of **7.0**.
