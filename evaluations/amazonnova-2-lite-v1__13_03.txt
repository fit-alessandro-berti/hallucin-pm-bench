**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (40% weight)**: Perfect match (exact count of 1, with case reference). +4.0
- **Part 2 (60% weight)**: Concise (≤120 words). Correctly notes small sample (3 cases, ~3h window—but actual span is ~1.75h, minor error -0.2). Identifies potential overestimation from 1 manual amid 2 autos (+1.5). However, significant deviations from ground truth: specifies "overestimate" vs neutral "misestimate" (-0.5); misses core sampling variance (0%-7% swing, wide CI, rare-event error) (-1.0); omits near-synonyms/"strict vs fuzzy matching" confusion (-1.0); adds speculation (seasonal/volume/routing, violating "no speculation") (-0.5). Total: +3.8/6.0.
- **Overall**: Strong structure/accuracy on count, but explanation diverges substantially on key statistical/observational points. Strict deduction for differences.
