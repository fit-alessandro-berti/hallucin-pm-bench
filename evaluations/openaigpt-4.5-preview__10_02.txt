4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates some understanding of the vocabulary mandate and the RACI requirements, but there are significant errors that result in a low score:

- **Enforced Vocabulary**: Mostly respects the vocabulary mandate, using "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst". However, in activities, the terms are not fully aligned with the requested phrasing (e.g., "Conduct KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" instead of simply "**KYC Review**" as in the ground truth; "Receive customer’s transfer instruction and log in system" vs. the ground truth's "**Receive Payment Instruction**").
- **Extra Tasks**: The LLM answer introduces two extra activities — "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archival completion" and splits "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and "Archive case file" into additional steps — which are not reflected in the ground truth. This results in an inaccurate mapping.
- **Missing Role (Operations Manager)**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role, which is a clear part of the ground truth and is assigned "A" (Accountable) in every activity. Since RACI matrices require both Responsible and Accountable assigned for each task, omitting this role is a substantial issue.
- **RACI Errors**: In some activities, "Transaction Analyst" is marked as both Responsible and Accountable ("R,A"), rather than splitting those responsibilities appropriately. Similarly, "Regulatory Liaison" is sometimes both "R,A", which does not align with the ground truth mapping.
- **Inconsistent Consulted/Informed Assignments**: The mapping of C and I are inconsistent with the ground truth. For example, IT Support is often set as "I" when the ground truth would have them as "C" or vice versa.

Strictly applying the stated criteria ("even small errors…significant loss of points"), these issues must be penalized heavily.

Thus, 4.0 is assigned due to:
- Use of correct role names but not mandated task/step phrasing,
- Omission of an entire required role,
- Invented activities/steps,
- RACI mapping errors throughout. 

The answer shows partial understanding but is seriously deficient in accuracy, fidelity to instructions, and strictness of RACI application.
