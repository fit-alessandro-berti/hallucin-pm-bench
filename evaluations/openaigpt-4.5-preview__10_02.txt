3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates basic adherence to the vocabulary mandate (correct use of "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and produces a Markdown RACI table, but it deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, completeness, and accuracy, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The LLM expands the source's 6 steps into 8 tasks, introducing unsubstantiated splits (e.g., separate rows for SWIFT sending and notification, which the ground truth consolidates into "Release Payment" and implies in "Archive Record"). This adds extraneous content (Task 8 is an inaccurate interpretation of the notification as a separate accountable action by IT) and fails to match the ground truth's concise 6-task organization.

- **Column Mismatch (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" column present in the ground truth, which handles many "A" (Accountable) roles. This results in incomplete role coverage, with the LLM incorrectly assigning "A" to "Transaction Analyst" in multiple places (e.g., Tasks 1, 2, 5) where the ground truth assigns it to "Operations Manager."

- **RACI Assignments Inaccuracies (Major Deduction: -2.5 points)**: Numerous mismatches in roles across tasks, even where descriptions align somewhat. Examples:
  - Task 1 equivalent: LLM assigns "R,A" to Transaction Analyst and "I" to IT Support; ground truth has "R" to Transaction Analyst, "A" to Operations Manager, "C" to IT Support.
  - Task 3/4 equivalents: LLM correctly identifies Regulatory Liaison as "R,A" but mismatches consultations (e.g., no "C" from Transaction Analyst in ground truth for KYC/Approval).
  - Task 5 equivalent: LLM has IT Support as "C" for release, but ground truth has "C" for IT in "Release Payment" while differing on accountabilities.
  - Archive (Task 6/7): LLM splits and assigns "R,A" to IT for both sending and archiving with "C" from Transaction Analyst; ground truth combines archiving under IT "R" with Operations Manager "A" and no split.
  These errors compound, as even minor role shifts (e.g., "I" vs. "C" for IT Support) violate strict mapping to the source and ground truth.

- **Task Descriptions and Formatting (Minor but Cumulative Deduction: -1.0 point)**: Descriptions are verbose and not fully mandated (e.g., "Conduct KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. ground truth's bolded "**KYC Review**"; no "Legend" section as in ground truth). Headers differ ("Activity Description" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), and the LLM lacks emphasis on mandated terms.

- **Strengths (Partial Credit: +3.5 points base)**: Covers the source material without omissions (though with extras), uses mandated vocabulary strictly, and formats as a valid Markdown table. No criminal or off-policy issues.

Overall, while the LLM attempts fidelity to the prompt, the proliferation of differences in tasks, roles, and assignments makes it a poor match to the ground truth, reflecting only ~35% alignment.
