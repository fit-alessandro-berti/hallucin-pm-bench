**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically: it introduces a new standalone `intermediateEvent` (violating the "no new activities/tasks" constraint, unlike the ground truth's attached boundary event); uses incorrect BPMN XML syntax (wrong tag `intermediateEvent` instead of `intermediateCatchEvent` or `boundaryEvent`, invalid `eventDefinition="timer"`, improper nesting); creates a parallel non-interrupting timer path from `VerifyID` that fires *unconditionally* after 48h (regardless of `CreateAccount` completion, causing false escalations and no enforcement); ignores the precise SLA timing (from *end of VerifyID*, but non-interruptive on the wrong path); and provides a misleading justification claiming escalation "if Create Account exceeds the SLA" when it does not check or interrupt `CreateAccount` at all.
