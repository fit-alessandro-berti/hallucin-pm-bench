**8.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "**No**" and provides accurate counterexamples for C003 (Validate_Payment before Receive_Order, citing lines 6-7) matching the ground truth precisely. It also correctly notes C005 as a counterexample (Validate_Payment at line 11 with no Receive_Order). However, deducting 2.0 points for significant differences: (1) unnecessary inclusion of positive examples (C001 lines 1-2, C004 lines 8-9) not in ground truth, adding irrelevant detail that dilutes focus; (2) suboptimal phrasing for C005 ("no subsequent Receive_Order" and mentioning Cancel_Order at line 12) which is technically true but indirectly addresses the issue (lack of prior Receive_Order) compared to ground truth's direct "never contains Receive_Order at all," introducing minor imprecision; (3) longer, less concise structure with extra bolding and introductory sentence ("The stated fact is **not** accurate") versus ground truth's tight bullets. Under utmost strictness, these extras and phrasing variances warrant deduction despite overall factual accuracy.
