3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points Section (Major Errors - Severe Point Loss)**: The ground truth strictly identifies only three true branching/decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval), focusing on points where the process flow branches based on conditions (e.g., score differences, amount thresholds, approve/reject vote). The LLM answer incorrectly expands this to six points, including non-branching steps like Quick KYC Verification and Neighbourhood Feedback Check as "decision points" with invented evaluations (e.g., "proceed if successful," "evaluate feedback quality"). It also misnames "Community Impact Assessment (CIA)" as "Impact Assessment" and implies a "decision to proceed based on community impact" not present in the process flow. The structure deviates (numbered list vs. ground truth's format), and it includes redundant details outside the prompt's exact terminology requirement. This fundamental misinterpretation of "decision points" (treating all steps as decisions) warrants a ~2.0 score for this section alone under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents Section (Minor Errors - Moderate Point Loss)**: The list is complete and matches all six items, adhering to exact terminology. However, small but penalized deviations include: adding "old" to "â‰¤ 3 months" in Proof of Address; inserting "single" in "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)"; adding "template" to "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template"; and using bullets instead of numbered list. The ground truth includes a clarifying note on excluded documents, which the LLM omits, slightly reducing completeness. These nitpicks deduct ~1.5 points under utmost strictness, but the core list is accurate.

- **Overall (Weighted Average)**: Decision points comprise the primary summarization task and show the most deviation (hallmarks of hallucination and non-adherence to "exact terminology and flow"), pulling the total down significantly. No introduction of standard loan terminology, which is a plus, but errors dominate. Strict holistic score reflects ~60-70% alignment at best.
