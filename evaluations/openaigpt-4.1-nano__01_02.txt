6.5

**Justification:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer correctly lists every required document with accurate names, order, and details matching the ground truth.
- The "Amount Threshold Decision" and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" decision points are precisely identified.
- The "Underwriter Alignment Gate" is described with proper logic and naming.
- No incorrect or extraneous documents are introduced.

**Errors (strictly penalized):**
- The LLM answer incorrectly includes **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** and **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)** as decision points. In the provided process, these are not **decision points**—they are mandatory process steps with no embedded branching logic or approval/rejection.
- Under **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**, the LLM answer suggests "evaluate feedback quality and completeness" as a decision point, but the process merely requires collection of at least three references without a documented decision gate there.
- The answer’s descriptions sometimes add superfluous interpretations (e.g., "proceed if successful," "decision to proceed"), despite the prompt’s instruction to follow the process strictly and avoid introducing steps/criteria not in the definition.
- Under "Impact Assessment", the LLM shifts from prescribed terminology to a hybrid ("Impact Assessment – Community Impact Assessment (CIA)") rather than using only the exact name (per instructions).
- Minor wording variances: e.g., "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" rather than "Community Impact Statement (CIS)"; "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" versus "Latest Income Statement (pay-stub/tax slip)".

**Summary:**  
The answer is mostly correct about the required documents, but the decision point summary includes steps that are not process branch points, causing meaningful deviation from the ground truth. Additional mild loss for minor deviations in terminology. Therefore, 6.5 is appropriate.
