The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false with a "No" response, followed by a single-paragraph justification citing the relevant cases (C003, C005) and lines (6, 11), aligning with the prompt's requirements. It accurately highlights the absence of a preceding *Receive_Order* in both cases, which directly counters the "always follows" claim. However, under utmost strictness, it loses a minor point for not explicitly noting (as the ground truth does) that C005 lacks *Receive_Order* entirely and that C003 shows a reversed order (line 7 after line 6), making the counterexamples slightly less detailed and comprehensive.
