The LLM answer is nearly entirely correct, with all factual questions (1â€“3) answered exactly and succinctly. Its percentage calculation matches the ground truth (5.56%). For question 4, both provided reasons are valid sampling issues ("insufficient sample size" and "sampling bias") and are explained clearly, though "sampling bias" could be more specific (e.g., referencing temporal bias or case-mix bias). The LLM does not hallucinate beyond the data. The only slight deduction is for not specifying "sampling bias" in a more concrete, fragment-specific way (such as explicitly noting the limited date coverage), which the ground truth prefers. Otherwise, the answer is fully aligned.
