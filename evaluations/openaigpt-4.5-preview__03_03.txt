10.0

The LLM answer is a semantically equivalent and correct BPMN 2.0 XML representation of the prompt's requirements. It includes all explicitly mentioned tasks verbatim (e.g., "validates the claim", "checks warranty eligibility", "send rejection notice"), uses the specified gateways (exclusive for validation completeness and warranty decision, parallel split/join for step 4), has exactly two end events, prefixes all IDs with "wrc_", and models only the described flow without inventions. Differences from the ground truth (e.g., IDs, casing in some names, namespace style without prefix, additional descriptive names on gateways/flows, inclusion of the required "checks warranty eligibility" task before the warranty gateway, extra XML attributes) are minor and stylistic, warranting full credit per the provided rubric. The ground truth itself omits the required "checks warranty eligibility" task and incorrectly routes directly from the completeness gateway to the warranty decision gateway, making the LLM answer superior in fidelity to the prompt. No deductions for hallucinations, omissions, or extras relative to the prompt.
