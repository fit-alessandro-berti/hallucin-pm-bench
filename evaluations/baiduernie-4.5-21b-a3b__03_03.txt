3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer attempts a BPMN 2.0 XML but deviates substantially from the prompt and ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key deductions (cumulative, with small errors compounded significantly):

- **Missing required elements (major omission, -4.0 points)**: No task for "checks warranty eligibility" (prompt step 3; implied as explicit activity). Flow from validation jumps incorrectly to a self-referencing sequence flow (`wrc_CheckWarrantyEligibility` sources/targets itself, invalid). Also missing task for "close the claim" (prompt step 5; ground truth has `wrc_close`). These are core flow elements explicitly mentioned—omissions break the process model.

- **Non-verbatim task names (multiple, -1.5 points)**: Prompt requires exact matching. Examples:
  - "validates the claim" → "Validate Claim" (missing "the", not verbatim; ground truth: "Validate the claim").
  - "requests missing information" → "Request Missing Information" (added capitalization, altered phrasing).
  - "Create shipment order for the replacement unit" → "Create Shipment Order for Replacement" (shortened, non-verbatim).
  - "Schedule courier pickup of the faulty product" → "Schedule Courier Pickup of Faulty Product" (capitalized, minor rephrasing).
  - "Send rejection notice" → "Send Rejection Notice" (capitalized, close but not exact).
  - "Update inventory records" matches, but others fail strict verbatim rule.

- **Invalid/undefined XML structure (critical errors, -2.0 points)**: 
  - Undefined sequence flows (e.g., `<outgoing>wrc_ValidationComplete</outgoing>` on `wrc_ValidateClaim`, but no `<sequenceFlow id="wrc_ValidationComplete">` defined in `<process>`; only referenced in DI).
  - Condition expressions misplaced (e.g., `${!isIncomplete}` on task outgoing, invalid—conditions belong on sequence flows from gateways per BPMN spec and prompt).
  - Broken flow logic: Validation gateway's "Yes" path (`wrc_ProceedToCheckEligibility`) targets a sequence flow ID instead of a task/gateway. Parallel join incoming refs itself (`<incoming>wrc_ParallelJoin</incoming>`). Self-referential flow for eligibility check renders XML non-executable/invalid.
  - Extra/invented elements: Start event name "Start Warranty Claim" (prompt: starts on "customer submits an online warranty claim"; ground truth: "Online warranty claim submitted"). Unnecessary condition expressions (e.g., `${isInWarranty}`) hallucinate beyond stated flows. Includes full `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` (extra; ground truth is minimal, no DI required).

- **Gateway and flow mismatches (-1.0 point)**: Uses required gateways (exclusive for completeness/warranty, parallel split/join), but flows are incomplete/incorrect (e.g., no loop-back wait explicitly modeled beyond basic flow; parallel split placed after undefined eligibility task). Ground truth has clean, numbered flows (`wrc_sf1`–`wrc_sf15`); LLM's are tangled and incomplete (e.g., no flow from eligibility task to gateway).

- **Minor semantic/ formatting issues (-0.5 points, strict penalty)**: Two end events present (good), IDs prefixed "wrc_" (good), but process ID "wrc_Process" vs. ground truth "wrc_process" (case mismatch). Namespace includes extras like `bpmndi`/`dc` (unnecessary bloat). Not "minimal-yet-complete" (LLM ~150+ lines vs. ground truth 34); includes hallucinatory names/descriptions.

Semantically, the model partially captures the loop, parallel branches, and rejection path but fails to model the full explicit flow accurately or validly. No credit for DI as it's not required and adds invalid refs. Overall, ~60% alignment at best, but strict rubric demands near-exactness for high scores—major flaws in completeness, validity, and fidelity drop it to 3.5.
