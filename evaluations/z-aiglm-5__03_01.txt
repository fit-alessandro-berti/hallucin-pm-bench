**5.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Line-by-Line Comparison)
The LLM answer captures the **core process flow correctly** (password reset path, diagnosis/forward/resolve, confirm loop to diagnosis, no inventions), matching the textual description and ground truth topology. However, under **utmost strictness**, it incurs **major deductions** for:

- **Functional errors (critical, -2.0)**: No `<conditionExpression>` on gw2/gw3 outflows (invalid exclusive gateways; ground truth has "yes"/"no"). gw1 conditions use non-standard `"Ticket == "Password Reset"`/`"Otherwise"` vs ground truth's `"yes"`/`"no"`.
- **Name mismatches (-1.5)**: t1 ("Classify Ticket" vs "Auto-Classification"); gw1 ("Classification Result" vs "Password Reset?"); gw2 ("Resolution Path" vs "Resolved Internally?"); gw3 ("Customer Confirmation" vs "Customer Confirms?"). Process lacks `name="Support-Ticket"`.
- **Structural/XML diffs (-1.0)**: Missing `<?xml version...?>`; targetNamespace mismatch (`http://acmetech.com/support` vs `/acmetech/support`); process `id` mismatch; inconsistent/missing `sequenceFlow id`s (e.g., gw2/gw3 flows unnamed/id-less vs f1-f13); gw2 flows misuse `name` attr without conditions.
- **Minor inconsistencies (-0.5)**: ID ordering (t4/t5 swapped vs ground, though logically equivalent); extra `name`s on flows.

**Total diffs**: ~25% elements/attributes mismatch or missing, including validity-breaking ones. No hallucinations, but not "exactly as stated" vs ground truth. Line count OK (34 vs 39).
