The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth and accurately models all explicitly mentioned flow elements from the prompt (including the required "checks warranty eligibility" task that the ground truth omits, making the LLM more complete without hallucinating extras). It uses the correct gateways, two end events, and wrc_ ID prefixes. The XML is valid BPMN 2.0 and self-contained. Minor deductions for: small task name deviations (e.g., "Validate claim" and "Close claim" omit "the" relative to ground truth and prompt verbatim intent, -0.3); invented condition expressions with specific values (beyond stated branches, -0.1); and non-minimal additions like exporter attributes, extra namespaces, verbose refs, and empty diagram section ( -0.1).
