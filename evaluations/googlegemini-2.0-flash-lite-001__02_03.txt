- The LLM answer is concise and correct in content for all three answers, matching the ground truth (A1: 3, A2: Pack_Items, A3: Cancel_Order). However, the LLM's formatting is slightly less explicit than the ground truth (ground truth uses "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" vs "3") and does not specify the case identifiers for question 1. While the substance is intact, the lack of explicit mention of the unique values for the `case` attribute (i.e., "C123, C456, C789") is a small but notable omission per the request to be strict, resulting in a loss of 1 point.
