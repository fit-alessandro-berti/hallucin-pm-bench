The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise as required by the prompt. All core facts match the ground truth: 3 cases (no need to list them, as the question only asks for the count), "Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" for C456, and "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once. Minor deduction for not explicitly stating "cases" in A1 (ground truth includes it for clarity) and slight formatting variance (numbered vs. A1/A2/A3 labels), treated as small stylistic differences under strict evaluation.
