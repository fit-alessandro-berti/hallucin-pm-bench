**3.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict scoring: 2.0 pts max per correct/identical Q; 0 for any deviation; Q5 array requires exact semantic match)
- **Q1**: Identical (3) → 2.0 pts
- **Q2**: Wrong ("B-1045" ≠ "Pack_Items"; case ID instead of activity) → 0 pts
- **Q3**: Identical → 2.0 pts
- **Q4**: Wrong (1 ≠ 2; missed C-77 event) → 0 pts (small numeric error = full deduction)
- **Q5**: Wrong array (includes first activities like "Receive_Order"/"Quality_Check"; misses "Ship_Order"; 4 items ≠ 3) → 0 pts

**Total: 4.0 raw → 3.0 scaled** (partial credit for 2/5 exact matches; major reasoning/log-parsing failures in rest penalize harshly per strictness rule).
