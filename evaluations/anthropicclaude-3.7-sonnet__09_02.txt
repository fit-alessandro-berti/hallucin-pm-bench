The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in identifying the impossibility of calculation due to missing timestamps and the presence of only event counts. It fulfills the prompt's requirement for a concise single-sentence explanation without introducing errors. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and less explicit mention of "start-to-completion intervals") under strict evaluation criteria.
