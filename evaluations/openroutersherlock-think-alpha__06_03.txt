The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, in the proper order, with no extraneous information about other processes. This matches the core content of the ground truth precisely. However, it loses points for minor formatting differences (commas instead of the ‖ symbol for parallelism, lack of descriptive labels like "Set 1 – first parallel block," absence of backticks around task names, and omission of the closing sentence confirming no other parallels), which introduce small but noticeable deviations under strict evaluation criteria.
