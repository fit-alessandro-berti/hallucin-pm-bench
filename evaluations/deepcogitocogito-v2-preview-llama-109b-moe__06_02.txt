The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the three parallel blocks with the exact tasks in the correct order, matching the ground truth content. However, it severely violates the prompt's instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" by including extensive unnecessary reasoning and explanation beforehand, which constitutes a major format and conciseness error. Minor spacing differences (single vs. double spaces after commas) also detract, but the primary issue is the extraneous text, leading to a strict deduction for not adhering to the expected output structure.
