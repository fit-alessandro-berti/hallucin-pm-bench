10.0

The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth answer in both content and format for the core requested output: each parallel block is enumerated on a numbered line, with the correct tasks listed and separated by commas. 

Although the LLM included an explanatory preamble and summary reasoning, the actual required output appears immediately after, clearly separated and formatted exactly as requested by the prompt and as shown in the ground truth answer. There are no extraneous lines, mistakes, or omissions in the answer section.

Therefore, the score is 10.0, as there are no errors—major or minor—in the required response.
