**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (perfect match)**: Correctly identifies **1** occurrence (case 1002), with exact string matching. No errors. (+5.0 points)
- **Part 2 (strong but imperfect)**: Core ideas align (small sample of 3 cases; naming variations like "Manual Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)" or "Automatic Fraud Check" causing estimation distortion). Word limit respected (~110 words). However:
  - Misses quantitative precision of ground truth (e.g., "14 events, <2 hours, swings 0%-7%, wide CI, extreme sampling error for rare events").
  - Adds minor speculation violating "no speculation" rule (e.g., hypothetical synonym "**Manual Fraud Review**" not in data; "outlier"; "end-of-month spikes").
  - Introduces extras like "temporal trends/clustering" and bullet structure not in ground truth, diluting focus on sampling error and strict/fuzzy matching.
  - Less concise/impactful than ground truth's statistical emphasis.
  
Overall: High fidelity (80%+ overlap) but strict deductions for speculation (-0.5), missing quant impact (-0.8), extras (-0.5).
