The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth across all questions, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. Question 1: Identical (1 occurrence). Question 2: Identical calculation and formatting (5.56%). Question 3: Identical (A1002 as the sole case). Question 4: Provides two clear, log-derived sampling reasons (temporal coverage and small sample size) that align directly with the ground truth's suggested examples (temporal bias and small sample size), without introducing external assumptions.
