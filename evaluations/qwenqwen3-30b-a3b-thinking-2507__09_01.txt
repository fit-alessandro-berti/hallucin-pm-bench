The LLM answer aligns closely with the ground truth in core conclusion (cannot derive/compute the value due to absent temporal data) and explanation (lack of timestamps/durations prevents calculation). Minor deductions for slight verbosity in addressing irrelevant benchmarks (not mentioned in ground truth, introducing a small extraneous element) and not explicitly noting "ordering information" or "fabricated" answers, though these are implicitly covered without error. Overall, highly accurate and strict adherence to system policy.
