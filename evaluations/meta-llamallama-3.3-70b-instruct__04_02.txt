4.0

R1: Correct (Compliant, reasonable justification).

R2: Incorrect. LLM says "Compliant," but the ground truth is "Violated"â€”the LLM did not account for the requirement for new approval after the Change_Request. Significant mistake.

R3: Correct (Violated, correct reasoning).

R4: Correct (Not Applicable, justification matches).

R5: Incorrect. LLM says "Compliant," but, per the trace, further processing (Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice) occurred before the new Manager_Approval, violating the rule.

R6: Correct (Compliant).

Overall: LLM's result (NON-COMPLIANT) matches the ground truth, but for the wrong reasons (misses R2 and R5 violations).

Other errors: Justifications for R2 and R5 are not strictly accurate.

Strict criteria: 3 major rule evaluation errors (R2 and R5 status, and their reasoning). Despite correct overall result, such mistakes warrant heavy penalties.

Final strict score: 4.0
