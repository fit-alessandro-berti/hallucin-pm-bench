The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth in content, structure, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and adherence to the specified output format (`Task_X  —  Task_Y` with appropriate spacing per line). The minor visual alignment differences in spacing (e.g., extra spaces in the ground truth's second line) are not required by the prompt and do not constitute an error. No other discrepancies exist.
