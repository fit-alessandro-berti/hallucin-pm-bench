**4.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria)
- **Task Compliance (Weight: 50%)**: Prompt requires **summarizing decision points** (branching/gating decisions only) and **listing every required document**. LLM fails critically on decision points by listing **8 process steps** (including non-decisions like KYC, CIA, Dual Underwriter Split, NFC, Disburse Funds) instead of the **exact 3 decision points** in ground truth (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, MBA). This introduces extraneous content, misrepresents "decision points" as full workflow, and deviates from ground truth structure/context (e.g., no "branch after Dual Underwriter Split"). Penalty: -8/10.
- **Accuracy & Fidelity to Ground Truth (Weight: 30%)**: Decision points mismatch (only partially overlaps 3/8 items, wrong emphasis/ordering). Documents match **perfectly** (exact list, terminology). No introduced standard terminology. Ground truth's note on exclusions absent but not required. Penalty: -4/10.
- **Format & Terminology (Weight: 20%)**: Uses exact activity names (good). But format differs (bulleted numbered list vs. ground truth's "#### Decision points" with inline conditions; no precise phrasing like "*If ... ⇒ ...*"). Overly verbose, includes process summaries not requested. Penalty: -3/10.

**Total: 4.2/10**. Major structural/interpretive error on core "decision points" (half the prompt) outweighs perfect documents; strictness demands heavy deduction for misrepresentation.
