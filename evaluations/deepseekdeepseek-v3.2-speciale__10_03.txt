**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary (perfect compliance, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact terms "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring". No leaks of disallowed synonyms.
- **Format/Structure (-4.0)**: Completely wrong RACI table orientation. LLM uses Activity | R | A | C | I (standard but not matching ground truth). Ground truth uses Activity | Role1 | Role2 | Role3 | Role4 with combined letters (e.g., **R, A**), bolding, and dashes (–). No bolding in LLM. Headers differ entirely.
- **Activities (-2.0)**: Adds unauthorized "Schedule Payment" (not in ground truth). Renames/merges "Release Funds & Notify" (ground truth has only "Release Funds"). Covers core 4 + extras, but violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities". 7 rows vs. ground truth 6.
- **RACI Assignments (major mismatches, -2.0)**: Systemic errors across nearly all cells:
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Missing Treasury Ops (I); Informed=Compliance Analyst (wrong, ground truth=Consulted). |
  | KYC Review | Compliance Analyst=**R** only (ground truth **R,A**); missing Compliance Officer (C), Treasury Ops (I). |
  | AML Screening | Same as KYC. |
  | Risk Scoring | Conditional Informed (wrong format/content); missing Front-Office Analyst (C). |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | Missing Front-Office Analyst (I), Compliance Analyst (C); wrong Informed (Treasury Ops vs. none). |
  | Schedule Payment | Unauthorized addition. |
  | Release Funds & Notify | Missing Compliance Analyst (C), Compliance Officer (C); renamed/merged. |
- **Overall**: Follows role roster and covers process, but differences are pervasive (format, extras, ~70% cell inaccuracy). Strict deduction for all violations yields 2.0.
