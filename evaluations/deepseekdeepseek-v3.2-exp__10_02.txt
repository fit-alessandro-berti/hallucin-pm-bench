3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
With utmost strictness, the LLM answer scores 3.5 due to substantial deviations from the ground truth, including structural, terminological, and content errors. While it correctly incorporates mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and produces a Markdown table covering the source steps (with minor mapping fidelity), it fails on multiple fronts:

- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: 
  - Missing "Operations Manager" column, which is central to the ground truth's RACI assignments (present as **A** in every row). The LLM uses only 3 columns vs. ground truth's 4, omitting a key role.
  - 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6; introduces an unmerged "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" row and numbers activities (1-7), splitting source step 5 incorrectly. Ground truth consolidates logically without numbering.
  - No use of **C** (Consulted) assignments at all, despite ground truth relying on them extensively (e.g., Analyst as **C** in KYC/Approval/Archive). LLM's assignments (e.g., excessive **I** for Liaison, no **A** separation) misalign completely with ground truth (e.g., Liaison as **A** only in screening, **R** in KYC/Approval).

- **Terminological and Wording Errors (Significant Deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Activity names differ: e.g., LLM's "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. bolded "**KYC Review**"; "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record". These are not exact matches, violating strict fidelity.
  - Uses "R/A" combined notation (non-standard for RACI, implying overlap), absent in ground truth, which separates **R** and **A** clearly.
  - Extra introductory text ("Of course...") and a full "RACI Key" explanation, while ground truth has only a brief "Legend" and meta-note. Prompt specifies "Put the table in Markdown" without extras.

- **Content Fidelity to Source and Ground Truth (Minor Positives, but Net Deduction: -0.5 points)**:
  - Covers all source tasks without omissions, mapping clerk to Analyst, CO to Liaison, and CDD to KYC Review correctly (partial credit).
  - Includes IT Support appropriately from source, but assignments diverge wildly (e.g., LLM has Analyst **R** for screening with Liaison **I**, vs. ground truth's Analyst **R**, Liaison **A**, Operations Manager **I**, IT **C**).

Base score started at 7.0 for mandated terms and table format, but deductions reflect "small errors" (e.g., wording variances) and larger ones (e.g., missing role, wrong assignments) per instructions. Perfect alignment would be 10.0; this is ~65% match at best.
