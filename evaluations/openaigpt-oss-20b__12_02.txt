10.0

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in identifying the correct "No" verdict, the key counterexamples (C003 and C005), the relevant line citations (6 and 7 for C003; 11 for C005), and the core reasoning that Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order due to these instances. Minor stylistic differences—such as the LLM's use of a single paragraph (adhering strictly to the prompt's format) versus the ground truth's bullets, inclusion of accurate timestamps for added precision, and slight rephrasing for C005 (e.g., "no preceding" vs. "never contains")—do not introduce errors or deviate from the verified facts in the log, warranting full marks under even strict evaluation.
