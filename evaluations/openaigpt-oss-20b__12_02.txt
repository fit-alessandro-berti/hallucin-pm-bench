9.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth: it correctly says "No," identifies both C003 (lines 6 and 7, order reversed) and C005 (Validate_Payment present without Receive_Order), and cites the line numbers as required. The justification is compact, accurate, and clearly references the key counter-examples.

Minor deduction: The LLM does not explicitly state “C005 never contains *Receive_Order*,” but instead says “with no preceding *Receive_Order* for that case-id,” which, while accurate, is slightly less explicit than the gold standard. Also, while the gold standard mentions "these instances prove..." (wrapping up with a clear logical conclusion), the LLM’s conclusion is a bit shorter and less formal.

Therefore, the small differences in phrasing and completeness justify a modest penalty: hence, 9.0.
