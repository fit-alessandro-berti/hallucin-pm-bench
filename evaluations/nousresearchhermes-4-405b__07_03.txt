The LLM answer closely follows the instructions, includes only the three required headings, and lists all relevant functional differences. However, there are several notable discrepancies compared with the ground truth:

- For ADDED TASKS, the LLM answer uses a colon and separates id and name with “:”, not parenthesis as instructed (`Task_FraudCheck: Automated Fraud Check` instead of `Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)`).
- Similarly, for REMOVED TASKS, the LLM answer uses a colon instead of parenthesis.
- For GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, while the changes themselves are correct, the LLM omits the required alignment of id and change (no space before or after the colon): it should be `Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel`, matching the formatting in the ground truth, but the LLM answer uses inconsistent or minimal spacing.
- The formatting overall is inconsistent with the strict formatting present in the ground truth, especially in the way names are shown for tasks and in the alignment for gateways.
- The LLM follows instructions well in not providing extraneous commentary or unchanged elements.

Due to these formatting and minor syntactic errors, which are important per instructions for strictness and verifiability, a significant penalty is warranted despite the overall completeness and correctness of substance.
