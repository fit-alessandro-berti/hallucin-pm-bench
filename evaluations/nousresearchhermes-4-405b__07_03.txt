7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (high marks)**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). No extraneous or missing changes, adhering to "verifiable differences only."
- **Format Deviations (significant deductions)**: Strict per prompt: Tasks must use "id followed by the name in parentheses" (e.g., "Task_X (Name)"). LLM incorrectly uses colon format (e.g., "Task_X: Name") for all 4 task bullets, violating the exact specification. This affects 100% of task listings. Gateways match the required "id: old â†’ new" format closely, though ground truth's alignment spaces on the second gateway line are absent (minor, but no deduction beyond tasks).
- **Structure Compliance (minor deduction)**: Headings are verbatim and in order, with no commentary or unchanged elements mentioned. Bullet consistency is good, but overall output fidelity is reduced by the pervasive task formatting error.
- **Strictness Applied**: Content perfection (10/10) but format errors across all tasks warrant a 3-point deduction (to 7.0), as small but repeated deviations from explicit instructions must reflect significant loss per guidelines.
