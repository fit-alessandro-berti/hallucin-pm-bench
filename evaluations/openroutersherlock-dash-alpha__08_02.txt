The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1 (claims "No" instead of "Yes"), misunderstanding the net's structure by ignoring the independent path via T2-T7 to mark P4 and enable T5 without T3. The Q2 explanation is flawed and does not provide a valid sequence, directly contradicting the ground truth's accurate analysis and firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5). This represents a complete failure to assess reachable markings correctly, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
