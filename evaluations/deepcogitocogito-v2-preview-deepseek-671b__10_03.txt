The LLM answer violates the strict vocabulary policy by repeatedly outputting disallowed synonyms (e.g., "Preliminary Assessment", "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)", "Sanctions Check", "risk rating") in its reasoning, even though the policy explicitly prohibits them "even in explanations". It fails to cover every activity by omitting the implied but described activities ("Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" from the process narrative's escalation, scheduling, and release steps), resulting in only 4 rows instead of 6. RACI assignments differ substantially in 3 of the 4 shared rows (e.g., Intake Vetting: Compliance Analyst I vs. C, Treasury Ops blank vs. I; Risk Scoring: Front-Office Analyst blank vs. C, Compliance Officer A,C vs. A). Formatting errors include blanks instead of dashes (â€“), lack of bolding, and no key points summary. The response includes excessive extraneous reasoning and explanations, violating the instruction to "Return the matrix as a Markdown table". These cumulative errors, including policy breaches and incomplete/inaccurate coverage, warrant a near-minimal score under strict evaluation criteria.
