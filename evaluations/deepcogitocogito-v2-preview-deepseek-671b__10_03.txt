**Evaluation of LLM Answer vs. Ground Truth:**

### Major Issues

1. **Missing Activities:**
   - The LLM only included four activities (“Intake Vetting,” “KYC Review,” “AML Screening,” “Risk Scoring”).
   - The ground truth matrix **includes six activities** (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”, “Compliance Officer Approval”, “Release Funds”).
   - The LLM explicitly refused to add “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds” as separate activities, despite these being clearly present in the process narrative.

2. **Incorrect Consulted/Informed Assignments:**
   - The LLM’s assignments for “Consulted” and “Informed” are frequently at odds with the ground truth:
     - For “Intake Vetting”, ground truth has Treasury Ops as “I” and Compliance Analyst as “C”; LLM assigns Compliance Analyst as “I” only and omits Treasury Ops.
     - “Risk Scoring” in the ground truth sets Compliance Officer as “A” and Compliance Analyst as “R”, with Front-Office Analyst as “C”; LLM gives Compliance Analyst “R”, Compliance Officer as “A, C”, and omits Front-Office Analyst.

3. **Incorrect Handling of “Accountable”:**
   - For "Risk Scoring", ground truth makes **Compliance Officer** solely “A”. In the LLM answer, “A” is given to “Compliance Officer”, but with the “A, C” blend, implying conditionality, which is not accepted in good RACI design, and more importantly, not done in the ground truth. LLM incorrectly blurs “A” and “C”.
   - In “KYC Review” and “AML Screening”, ground truth restricts “A” only to Compliance Analyst, which is mostly correct, but LLM also sometimes offers “C” to Compliance Officer with ambiguous justifications.

4. **Missing Dashes for No Involvement:**  
   - The ground truth output uses dashes to indicate roles with no involvement; LLM leaves these cells blank.

5. **Vocabulary Policy Compliance:**  
   - The LLM correctly uses only the strict mandated terms (no synonyms appear), which is a major positive.

6. **Justification Length and Output Format:**  
   - The LLM provides excessive justification and step-by-step thinking, contrary to the prompt’s instruction to “return the matrix as a Markdown table; do not rename, merge, or add activities”.
   - The Markdown table provided at the end isn’t formatted as tightly as the ground truth.

### Minor Issues

- The LLM’s matrix omits some required assignments (e.g., missing “I” or “C” in certain cells where the ground truth specifies those).
- “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds” are clear distinct activities—refusing to model them is an error, as they are not “added activities” but plainly described in the Process Narrative.
- Extra explanations clutter the output.

### Summary Table for Major Discrepancies:

| Error Type            | Severity | Example(s)                                                |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing activities    | Very High| Entire rows for “Compliance Officer Approval”, “Release Funds” absent |
| RACI mismatches       | High     | “Intake Vetting” and “Risk Scoring” assignments incorrect |
| Missing dashes        | Medium   | Roles uninvolved with activities left blank, not dashed   |
| Unnecessary prose     | Medium   | Long justification beyond required matrix-only output      |
| Vocabulary slip       | Low      | None observed – good compliance                           |

### Grading Rationale

- **10.0:** Perfect or near-perfect match, virtually no errors.
- **7.0–8.0:** Minor cell mismatches, but all activities represented and matrix structure intact.
- **4.0–6.0:** Major omissions (activity-level or entire roles), significant RACI misassignments.
- **1.0–3.5:** Numerous critical failures (wrong terminology, completely wrong structure, blends of synonyms, major format violations).

**This answer earns a 4.0.**  
- *Success:* No vocabulary leakage, matrix respects the “do not add or merge activities” policy in terms of terminology.
- *Failures:* Only ~2/3 of the needed activities modeled, several cell assignments erroneous (especially R vs. C vs. I), incomplete role representation, and lack of dashes marking non-involved roles.  
- *Conclusion:* Matrix structure is present, correct terms are used, but the omission of several key activities and frequent RACI assignment errors are significant and lower the grade sharply.
