The LLM answer accurately identifies that the claim is incorrect and cites the relevant cases (C003 and C005), referencing the correct line numbers and giving clear reasoning. The answer paraphrases the evidence correctly and matches the key logic of the gold-standard answer. There is a minor wording issue in the phrase "occurs without first following a 'Receive_Order' event" (should be "occurs without previously having a 'Receive_Order' event"), and in C005, it only implies but doesnâ€™t state explicitly that "Receive_Order" never appears in that case (whereas the gold-standard makes this explicit). These small imprecisions, though minor, reflect a slight but significant deviation from the most precise analysis, resulting in a loss of 1 point for strictness.
