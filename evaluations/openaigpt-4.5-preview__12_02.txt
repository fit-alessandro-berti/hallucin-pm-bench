The LLM answer is an exact match in accuracy, structure, and content to the ground truth: it correctly answers "No," identifies the same two counter-examples (C003 with reversed order on lines 6-7, and C005 with Validate_Payment on line 11 lacking any prior Receive_Order), cites the precise line numbers and case-IDs, and provides a concise one-paragraph justification that directly refutes the "always follows" claim without introducing errors, omissions, or extraneous details.
