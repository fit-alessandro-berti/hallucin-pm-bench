The LLM answer accurately identifies all changes: three added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), one removed task (Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision. It adheres strictly to the three required headings without extraneous details like the ground truth's markdown formatting, explanatory abbreviations (XOR/OR), version specifications (v1/v2), numbered lists, bolding, backticks, escaped underscore, or footer note. However, minor differences deduct points: (1) presentation of tasks as "ID (name)" instead of "name (`ID`)", (2) bullet points instead of numbered lists, and (3) slightly less verbose gateway description (though it matches the prompt's example phrasing). No factual errors, but stylistic variances warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
