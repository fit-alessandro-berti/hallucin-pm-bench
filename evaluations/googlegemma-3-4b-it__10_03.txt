The LLM answer violates the strict vocabulary policy by using the disallowed term "Preliminary Assessment" instead of "Intake Vetting," failing to include "Intake Vetting" at all, and introducing additional unauthorized activities ("Escalation," "Payment Scheduling," "Notification," "Funds Release") that merge, rename, or add beyond the prompt's narrative without matching the ground truth structure. RACI assignments are inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., Risk Scoring incorrectly assigns R to Front-Office Analyst instead of C, with no A for Compliance Officer; missing combined roles like R,A and consultations/informations). Formatting deviations include blanks instead of dashes (–), lack of bolding, and incomplete coverage of roles' involvements (e.g., no C or I entries matching ground truth). These errors—large in naming/policy adherence and pervasive in content/structure—result in minimal alignment with the ground truth under strict evaluation criteria.
