2.0

The LLM answer exhibits significant deviations from the ground truth, summarized as follows:

- **Vocabulary Violations (Major):** The LLM answer uses disallowed terms: "Preliminary Assessment" (should be "Intake Vetting"), missing the explicit term "Intake Vetting" entirely; "KYC Review" is present and correct, but "AML Screening" is used (acceptable); "Risk Scoring" is *incorrectly* assigned due to unclear role designation and is also out of alignment with the required vocabulary policy; most critically, the LLM uses additional activities wholly absent from the process narrative (e.g., “Escalation”, “Notification”, “Payment Scheduling”), violating the instruction not to add, merge, or rename activities.

- **Activity List Errors (Major):** The LLM invents or renames activities ("Escalation", "Payment Scheduling", "Notification") and omits some required ones ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). "Risk Scoring" is listed as a stand-alone activity, but the role assignments do not match the ground truth.

- **Role Assignment Errors (Major):** Responsibility (R), Accountability (A), etc. designations are incomplete or inaccurate throughout. For example, dual roles such as "R, A" for Intake Vetting, KYC Review, and AML Screening are not reflected; Accountable assignments (A) are missing or implied by single "R" only. The LLM also assigns improper responsibility for "Notification" and other non-existent activities.

- **Formatting Errors (Moderate):** The matrix does not bold or dash inactive roles as in the gold answer. "–" for no-involvement is omitted, and consult/inform roles are missing throughout.

Given these severe deviations from vocabulary, content, and role mapping instructions, especially the failure to use "Intake Vetting" and the introduction of new/renamed activities, the answer only minimally approximates the requirements and thus receives a strict score of 2.0.
