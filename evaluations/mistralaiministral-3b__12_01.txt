The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a concise, evidence-based justification citing all relevant cases (1001, 1002, 1003) with specific activities and timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's structure and key points (reversed ordering in 1001/1003, absence in 1002 disproving "always"). Minor deduction for not explicitly labeling a "verdict" section (as in ground truth) and for phrasing that implies focus on "immediately before" without emphasizing the full reversal or line numbers, though this does not alter the factual accuracy.
