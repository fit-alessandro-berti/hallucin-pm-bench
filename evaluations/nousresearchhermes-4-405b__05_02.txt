The LLM answer deviates critically from the ground truth and prompt rules by proposing two separate attribute modifications (violating "exactly ONE" improvement) on incorrect tasks and due dates (Sign Contract and Collect Equipment to P2D/P4D instead of only Collect Equipment to P2D), uses an improper multi-line diff format instead of a single minimal hunk, and provides a rationale that ignores the specific 3-day SLA context while falsely claiming a 2-day compression without evidence of compliance.
