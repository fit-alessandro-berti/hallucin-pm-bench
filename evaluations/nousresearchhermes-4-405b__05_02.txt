The LLM answer makes two unauthorized changes: it reduces the due date for "Sign Contract" from P3D to P2D **and** for "Collect Equipment" from P5D to P4D, thus performing more than one modification. The rules explicitly demand "exactly ONE" improvement. Furthermore, the due date for "Collect Equipment" is only reduced to P4D, not the required P2D as per the ground truth. While the format of the diff and rationale are acceptable, this answer makes multiple changes where only one is allowed, and fails to match the specific and necessary modification to meet the SLA as found in the ground truth. Each of these points is a significant error under strict grading.
