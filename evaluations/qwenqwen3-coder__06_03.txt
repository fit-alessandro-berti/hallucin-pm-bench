The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executed tasks within Process B, numbering them in order and specifying the members of each set accurately, matching the ground truth in content. The slight deduction is due to the presence of additional explanatory text in the LLM answer (“These sets represent...”), whereas the ground truth provides a very strict, concise format and explicitly states “No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel.” Additionally, the answer should have numbered the sets as “1.” and “2.” as in the ground truth and quoted the task names as code or in quotes for perfect match. Nevertheless, the core content is correct and complete.
