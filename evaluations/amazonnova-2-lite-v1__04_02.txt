**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Overall result correct (NON-COMPLIANT). R1, R3, R6 statuses and justifications closely match ground truth. Format approximates required structure (status + short justification per rule).
- **Major errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **R2**: Status correct (Violated), but justification fundamentally wrong—miscalculates days after *initial* approvals (Ship_Goods on 03-05 is *within* 2 days of 03-04 Finance_Approval); ignores change-triggered new approval (07-15) as "last required approval," mismatching ground truth reasoning. (-2.0)
  - **R4**: Wrong status (**Compliant** vs. **Not Applicable**)—prompt distinguishes NA for unmet preconditions (hazardous=false); justification similar but tied to error. (-1.5)
  - **R5**: Status correct, but justification incomplete/misleading—focuses only on Pay_Invoice, ignores Ship_Goods (first further step post-Change_Request) before new Manager_Approval; doesn't fully match ground truth. (-1.0)
- **Minor issues**: Slight format deviations (e.g., all-caps statuses, "Rule Replies:" intro, no table); R1/R3/R6 minor phrasing diffs (-0.5 total).
- **Total**: 10 - 5.0 = 5.0. Strict per instructions: 3/6 rules have substantive differences in status/justification accuracy; no perfection despite correct overall.
