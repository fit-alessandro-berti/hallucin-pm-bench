**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Q1-Q2 match ground truth exactly (counts, calculations, rounding, formatting minor variations irrelevant). Q3 (87 words) explicitly covers all required elements: (i) single occurrence ("only one occurrence"), (ii) variance/instability ("statistically insignificant", "outlier that skews average processing times", "noise"), (iii) caution against over-generalisation ("Generalizing from this data risks overlooking...", "failing to predict it for future"). Uses only supplied data; process-mining concepts (long-tail, aggregates) enhance relevance without invention. No errors.
