4.5

The LLM answer demonstrates some understanding of the requested vocabulary restrictions and roles, but contains several substantive and structural errors compared to the ground truth:

**Strengths:**
- All four mandated terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) are used correctly and no synonyms appear.
- The matrix is rendered as a markdown table.

**Major Errors:**
1. **Activity Names Deviate from Ground Truth:**
   - The activities “Approval” and “Funds Release” do not match “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds” from the ground truth. This is a moderate error since “Compliance Officer Approval” was needed for clarity and alignment.
2. **Incorrect RACI Assignment:**
   - For “Intake Vetting”, Front-Office Analyst should be “R, A” and Treasury Ops should be “I” (Informed), but Treasury Ops is blank and “C” (Consulted) for Compliance Analyst is missing.
   - For “KYC Review”, the Compliance Officer should be “C” (Consulted) and Treasury Ops should be “I” (Informed), both missing.
   - For “AML Screening”, Compliance Officer as “C” and Treasury Ops as “I” are missing.
   - For “Risk Scoring”, Compliance Analyst is shown as “R, A”, but ground truth has Compliance Analyst “R” and Compliance Officer “A”. Also, Front-Office Analyst should be “C” and Treasury Ops “I”.
   - “Approval”: LLM answer merges the activity “Compliance Officer Approval” into just “Approval”, assigning “R, A” to Compliance Officer, but omits the “I” for Front-Office Analyst and lacks “C” for Compliance Analyst.
   - “Funds Release” omits “C” for Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer, and “I” for Front-Office Analyst.
3. **Omissions/Blanks:** 
   - Dashes (–) should be used for roles with no involvement, but are replaced with blanks, lowering clarity and accuracy.
4. **Loss of Columns and Specificity:**
   - Releases two distinct activities in the ground truth (“Compliance Officer Approval”, “Release Funds”) as just “Approval” and “Funds Release”, a notable loss of process specificity.

**Summary:**  
- The LLM output passes the strict vocabulary requirements.
- However, failure to correctly assign consulted/informed roles, omitting dashes, and activity name mismatches significantly reduces accuracy and process compliance.

**Strictly assessed:** These errors—especially in matrix detail and process nuance—justify a significant points loss, resulting in a **4.5**.
