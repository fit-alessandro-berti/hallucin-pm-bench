The LLM answer perfectly identifies the two correct parallel pairs from Process B: (Create_Documentation, Quality_Check) and (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines). The pairs are listed in alphabetical order both within each pair (C before Q, P before S) and overall (C-pair before P-pair). It outputs exactly one pair per line in the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y`, ignoring Process A as instructed. 

The only differences from the ground truth are minor whitespace variations (e.g., exact number of spaces around the em dash and lack of columnar alignment padding on the second line, plus possible trailing spaces), and absence of markdown code block fences (which were not required by the prompt). Under utmost strictness, these trivial formatting discrepancies warrant no deduction, as the content, structure, and compliance are identical and exact to requirements. No functional or semantic errors.
