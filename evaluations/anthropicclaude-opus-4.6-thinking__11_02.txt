**9.4**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high alignment, minimal loss):** Perfect match on the **three worst-performing activities** (Request_Documents #1, Review_Documents #2, Initial_Assessment #3), correctly ordered by clear data differentiation (e.g., Request_Documents dominates wait/rework/throughput drop; Review_Documents leads proc time/SLA/stdev/rework; Initial_Assessment tops remaining wait/SLA). Explanations strictly table-based, citing exact metrics (e.g., 150 min wait, 22% rework, 270→190 throughput drop; 25 min proc, 12.4% SLA, σ=9; 18 min wait, 3.2% SLA). One concrete, data-driven action per activity, tied to metrics (e.g., rework-driven checklist; variability/SLA-driven tiering). No absent activities mentioned. Concise memo format (<200 words, ~185 estimated). Data-driven closing projection (~100 cases/day) plausible from table drops (280→179 total).
- **Differences/Deductions (strict penalties for variance):** Stylistic (elaborate header vs. GT's simple; σ notation extra but accurate). Explanations reorder/omit minor metrics (e.g., LLM skips Review_Documents' 30 min wait, emphasizes stdev instead). Recommendations creative but fully divergent (e.g., LLM: registration checklist vs. GT digital validation; tiered protocols vs. AI squad; template vs. triage engine)—valid but not matching. Closing projection differs (~100 cases vs. 10% throughput/40% SLA). No factual errors/hallucinations, but ~6% content divergence = 0.6 point loss from 10.0.
