2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM correctly uses only the four authorized terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. No deductions here, but this is the only strong match.
- **Coverage of Activities (Major Failure)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** described in the narrative, which includes six distinct steps: the four mandated ones plus escalation/Compliance Officer Approval and fund release/scheduling by Treasury Ops. The LLM omits the last two entirely, violating "covering every activity" and effectively merging or ignoring parts of the process. This alone warrants severe deduction (~ -4 points).
- **RACI Assignments (Numerous Errors)**: Even for the four shared activities, assignments diverge significantly from ground truth, indicating misinterpretation of roles/responsibilities:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM incorrectly informs CO (I) where ground truth has no involvement (-); consulted CA matches, but overall incomplete.
  - **KYC Review & AML Screening**: LLM wrongly consults FOA (C) where ground truth has none (-); treats CO as informed (I) instead of consulted (C). Combines R/A for CA (matches), but extras distort.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Major mismatches—LLM assigns A to CA instead of CO; R to CA matches but lacks FOA as C (LLM informs FOA instead); CO as C only vs. A. This inverts accountability.
  These per-activity errors (small but cumulative, per strictness rule) compound to show poor process comprehension (~ -2.5 points total).
- **Matrix Structure & Formatting (Inconsistencies)**: LLM uses R/A/C/I as columns with role abbreviations in cells, while ground truth uses roles as columns with R/A/C/I in cells—both valid RACI formats, but LLM's adds a non-requested title and legend, and uses abbreviations without full expansion in-table. Ground truth uses bolding, commas (e.g., "R, A"), and dashes consistently; LLM's single letters without combos feel abbreviated/incomplete. Minor but deducts for not mirroring ground truth fidelity (~ -1 point).
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, small errors (e.g., I vs. C for CO, extra I for FOA) each cost significantly, as do omissions. The LLM captures ~40% accuracy on the core four activities but fails holistically on completeness and precision, yielding a low score.
