9.0

The LLM answer contains both correct pairs, matching the ground truth in terms of content:

- Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
- Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check

However, the order does not match the requested alphabetical order of pairs in the overall list; "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" should come before "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines". This small error in overall pair ordering warrants a significant penalty according to the strictness instructions, dropping the score from 10.0 to 9.0. The within-pair alphabetical order is correct. No other content deviations are present.
