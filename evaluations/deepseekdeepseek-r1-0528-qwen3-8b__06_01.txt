### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct Identification of Pairs (Strength)**: The LLM correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B: (Create_Documentation, Quality_Check) and (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines). This matches the ground truth exactly in content and within-pair alphabetical ordering (C before Q; P before S). No extraneous or missing pairs are included, aligning with the description's explicit parallelism (post-Fabricate and post-Create_Work_Order).
- **Overall Alphabetical Order (Major Error)**: The pairs are listed in reverse alphabetical order (starting with "P" then "C"), directly violating the prompt's requirement for "alphabetical order... in your overall list." Ground truth starts with "C" then "P." This is a clear, non-trivial deviation, warranting significant deduction under strict evaluation.
- **Output Format (Moderate Error)**: The LLM includes unnecessary introductory text ("Okay, here is the list..."), which deviates from the specified format of "one pair per line" with no preamble. Ground truth outputs only the pairs (plus optional rationale not required by the prompt). Minor formatting (e.g., spacing around em dashes) is consistent, but the extra text disrupts adherence.
- **Absence of Rationale (Minor Error)**: The ground truth includes a rationale explaining the pairs and confirming no others qualify, but the prompt does not require it. Omitting it is not a deduction-worthy flaw but highlights incomplete alignment with the full ground truth structure.
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the core content is 90% accurate, but the ordering error alone (a explicit instruction) and format deviation reduce the score substantially. No criminal or off-policy issues apply.
