The LLM answer is entirely incorrect:

- It does not correctly list any valid pairs of tasks from Process B that can be executed in parallel.
- The output contains nonsensical or garbled text ("Procure theaterial  — B B_M_M_M_M" and "— — — Documentation Documentationationation — — — — —"), which does not correspond to actual process steps.
- It fails to follow the required output format (proper task names, line per pair, alphabetical order within and between pairs).

No part of the answer matches the ground truth, and it does not reflect any accurate understanding of the process steps or instructions. Even small errors are significantly penalized per your instructions; here, the errors are total.
