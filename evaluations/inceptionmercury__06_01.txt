1.0

The LLM answer is completely incoherent, fails to list any valid pairs in the required format, uses garbled and incorrect task names (e.g., "Procure theaterial" instead of "Procure_Materials", nonsensical "B B_M_M_M_M"), includes irrelevant repetitions and dashes, and does not adhere to alphabetical ordering or the specified output structure. It differs entirely from the ground truth, identifying no accurate parallel pairs and providing no usable information, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
