**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision Points (major deductions: ~4.5 points lost)**: Ground truth identifies **exactly 3 precise decision points** with specific locations, branching logic, and outcomes (e.g., eligibility rejection explicit; amount *after* PreApprove; final approval *at* PreApprove/Auditor). LLM invents **4 points**, misgroups (treats PreApprove as standalone #2, vague "after amount known" for #3 instead of *after PreApprove*, adds ungrounded #4 "payment authorization" as separate despite constraints folding into prerequisites), omits rejection in #1, and adds interpretive details/phrasing not in process/GT (e.g., "operational records", "gateway", sub-conditions in #4). This is a structural/content mismatch, not a summary of *every* process decision point per GT.
- **Documents List (minor deductions: ~0.5 points lost)**: Matches GT's 7 items exactly (including conditional AuditTrail note), no extras/omissions. Structure similar but adds parenthetical for PDF (unnecessary verbosity).
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity (minor deductions: ~0.8 points lost)**: LLM uses verbose bullets/headings with per-decision docs (not requested/separated as in GT table + list); introduces minor inferences (e.g., RefundRequestForm as "customer’s submission" in #1); no undefined elements added, but paraphrasing deviates from GT's concise, tabular precision.
- **Strictness Applied**: Even "small" mismatches (vague timing, extra point, missing rejection outcome) incur outsized penalties per instructions; core prompt (every decision point + docs list) ~60% aligned due to decisions flaw. No criminal/policy issues.
