5.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence, tied to CaseID 1002). Full credit (10/10).
- **Question 2**: Response stays under 120 words (118) and addresses potential misestimation via string matching issues, but introduces unsupported speculation about non-existent variations (e.g., "Fraud Check (Manual)"), violating the "no speculation" rule. Misses core ground truth emphasis on tiny sample size (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), statistical sampling error, frequency swings (0% to 7%), and wide confidence intervals for rare events in a month-long log. Incorrectly highlights "Manual Review" as a likely alias without data support, while ground truth correctly references actual log variants like "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)". Major deviations in reasoning and adherence to data-only constraint justify substantial deduction (2/10). Overall score averages the two parts, weighted toward the explanatory depth required in Q2.
