4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Vocabulary compliance**: Perfect match (uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst” exclusively where required). No loss here.
- **Table structure**: Major differences (-2.0). LLM uses 4 columns (# + 3 roles) with 8 rows; GT uses 5 columns (no #) with 6 rows. Extra # column unnecessary; combined **R/A** notation vs. GT's separate R/A per column.
- **Roles**: Significant mismatch (-1.5). LLM correctly sticks to source-derived roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support); GT introduces unsubstantiated "Operations Manager" (A for nearly all rows). LLM avoids invention but lacks GT's column.
- **Task coverage and naming**: Partial coverage but mismatched granularity and wording (-1.5). LLM splits source steps faithfully into 8 granular tasks (e.g., separate receive/log, SWIFT send, explicit notify), covering *every* source task without omission. GT combines/omits (e.g., no explicit log or SWIFT; "Archive Record" vs. LLM's detailed "Archive case file and notify Regulatory Liaison"). Names differ (e.g., "Receive transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List").
- **RACI assignments**: Frequent mismatches (-1.0). Approximate alignment on main actors (e.g., Analyst for release/screen, Liaison for KYC/approve, IT for archive/SWIFT), but differences in nearly every row (e.g., screen: Analyst R/A vs. Analyst R + Liaison A; KYC/approve: Analyst I vs. C; consistent missing Ops A; IT I vs. C in several; archive Analyst I vs. C).
- **Other formatting**: Minor diffs (e.g., legend phrasing, bolding, header wording) (-0.5). Both clear Markdown RACI tables with legends.
- **Overall fidelity to source/prompt**: LLM excels in exhaustive coverage of informal description (no omissions), but strict GT comparison penalizes all divergences heavily. Semantically ~60% aligned, but structural/exact mismatches dominate under "utmost strictness". Base 10 - 6.5 deductions = 3.5, rounded to 4.0 for vocabulary/ coverage strengths.
