3.5

### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer attempts to model the process but introduces several critical errors that deviate significantly from the prompt and ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Missing exclusive gateway for the first decision point (classification)**: The prompt explicitly requires exclusive gateways for the two decision points (classification and diagnosis). The LLM uses direct conditional sequence flows from `t1` to `t2`/`t3` without a gateway (`gw1` in ground truth). This is invalid BPMN for an exclusive choice and violates the "exactly as stated" rule. Major deduction (-2.0 points).

- **Incomplete second gateway (diagnosis)**: `gw1` in LLM has outgoing flows to `t4` and `t5` without conditions (unlike ground truth's `f7`/`f8` with "yes"/"no"). This breaks the decision logic, as BPMN exclusive gateways require conditioned outflows for branches. Significant error (-1.5 points).

- **Invented elements not mentioned**: Added a "Close Ticket" task (`t8`), which is not in the description (line 8 says "the ticket is closed," implying an end event, as in ground truth). Also, duplicate "Resolve Issue" tasks (`t4` and `t6`) instead of reusing one (as in ground truth `t4`). Violates "Do not invent or add" rule. (-1.5 points).

- **Minor but cumulative errors**: 
  - Task names slightly off (e.g., "Classify Ticket" vs. ground truth's "Auto-Classification"; no indication of automation).
  - Conditions use complex `${}` expressions instead of simple "yes"/"no" (ground truth style), and the confirmation loop uses `${issuePersists}` which inverts the logic slightly from line 9.
  - Missing names on events/gateways (ground truth includes descriptive names like "Password Reset?").
  - No `<?xml>` declaration, process lacks `name` or `isExecutable` attributes, different namespaces/IDs (e.g., "process" vs. "support_ticket").
  - Only two gateways used, but the rework loop requires a third for confirmation (ground truth uses `gw3`; LLM squeezes it into `gw2` but still adds invalid task).

The overall flow captures the loop and most tasks/sequence correctly, avoiding major hallucinations like timers or parallel paths, which prevents a total failure. However, the BPMN inaccuracies and additions make it non-compliant and not executable as valid XML for the described process. Line count is under 40 (~35 lines), but quality is poor. Under utmost strictness, this scores low despite partial structure.
