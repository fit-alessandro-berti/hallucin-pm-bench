2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and adherence to the prompt's requirements, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Columns/Roles (Major Error, -3.0 points)**: The ground truth uses "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "Operations Manager", and "IT Support". The LLM incorrectly treats "KYC Review" (a mandated *activity* term, not a role) as a column/role, omits "Operations Manager" entirely, and reorders columns inconsistently. This violates the prompt's mandate to use *only* specified terms for roles and introduces a fundamental misuse, creating invalid RACI assignments (e.g., "KYC Review" assigned "R" to itself in task 3).

- **Tasks/Activities (Major Error, -2.5 points)**: The ground truth has exactly 6 tasks with precise, mandated wording (e.g., "**KYC Review**" as a bolded task, "Receive Payment Instruction", "Archive Record"). The LLM expands to 8 tasks, adding unsubstantiated ones like "Send the SWIFT message" (split from task 5), "Archive the case file" (as separate task 7), and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion" (as new task 8, with invented self-assignment). This omits faithful mapping (e.g., no combined "Release Payment" equivalent) and ignores the source text's 6 steps, introducing extras and substitutions not in the informal description or mandates.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Error, -1.5 points)**: Assignments rarely match. For example:
  - Ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction": TA **R**, RL I, OM **A**, IT C. LLM: Only TA R (misses others).
  - Ground truth's "**KYC Review**": RL **R**, OM **A**, TA C, IT I. LLM: Misassigns "R" to invalid "KYC Review" role.
  - Ground truth's "Approve High-Risk Transactions": RL **R**, OM **A**, TA C, IT I. LLM: RL A (partial match but misses others and lacks accountability depth).
  - Similar mismatches across all tasks, with LLM using excessive "C" for RL and ignoring "Operations Manager" accountabilities.

- **Formatting and Adherence (Minor Error, -0.5 points)**: LLM adds an unnecessary "Legend" section and explanatory text post-table, while ground truth keeps it concise with legend inline. LLM's task titles are verbose and not mandated (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. ground truth's succinct "**KYC Review**"). Dashes for empties are acceptable but inconsistent with ground truth's implied sparsity.

Overall, the LLM captures the basic RACI concept and some mandated terms (e.g., correct use of "Transaction Analyst" and "Regulatory Liaison" in places) but fails to mirror the ground truth's fidelity to the source, vocabulary, and structure, resulting in a fragmented, inaccurate table. No perfect matches in rows or holistic coverage.
