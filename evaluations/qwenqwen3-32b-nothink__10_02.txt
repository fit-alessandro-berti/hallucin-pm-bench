4.0

**Comments and Justification:**

- **Vocabulary Compliance:** The answer abides by the vocabulary mandate for roles ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") but **incorrectly adds a column for "KYC Review" as if it's a role**, which it is not—it's an activity. The ground truth uses only the allowed role names as columns.
- **Missing Role:** The "Operations Manager" role, which is present and central in the ground truth answer, is **completely omitted** from the LLM answer.
- **Activity Wording:** The activity/task wording is partly inconsistent with the mandated wording. For example, the LLM answer lists "Send the SWIFT message" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion," which are not mapped to the mandated vocabulary or matching the ground truth structure. The ground truth uses, e.g., "**KYC Review**", "Archive Record"—the LLM answer is inconsistent here.
- **Task Structure & Mapping Errors:** The LLM answer introduces extra tasks (e.g., "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion") not present in the ground truth and merges or splits activities in ways that do not map cleanly from the source text.
- **Assignment of RACI Values:** The RACI assignments often differ from the ground truth (e.g., in "Screen Against Sanctions List," the ground truth makes Regulatory Liaison Accountable; in the LLM answer, Regulatory Liaison is only Consulted).
- **Overall Structure:** The ground truth presents a more accurate mapping between mandated wording, roles, and activities—while the LLM invents or mislabels both rows and columns.  
- **Strictness:** These are substantial errors given the instructions, especially regarding the use of activity vs. role naming, omission of a mandated role, and inaccuracies in mapping RACI responsibilities.

**Conclusion:** Serious adherence problems with both structure and mandated vocabulary mapping, though the answer makes an attempt at the format and partial vocabulary. Thus, 4.0.
