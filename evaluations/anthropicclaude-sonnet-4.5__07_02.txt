7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key structural changes (added tasks: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject; removed: Reject Loan; gateway: exclusive to inclusive) and adheres to the core headings without introducing unmentioned categories. It properly ignores cosmetic elements like the Task_ApproveLoan name change, with an accurate note on this.

However, under strict evaluation criteria:
- **Mischaracterization in Added tasks**: Describing `Task_FinalReject` as "replaces the previous reject task (renamed/re-purposed)" is incorrect and misleading. It is a distinct new task (new ID, new branch/path), not a renamed replacement for `Task_RejectLoan` (which is separately removed). This blurs added vs. removed changes, warranting a -1.5 deduction (significant interpretive error).
- **Extra descriptive text**: Unnecessary details (e.g., "inserted after the start event", "as one of the gateway outcomes") deviate from the ground truth's concise listing, adding non-essential analysis (-0.5).
- **Format inconsistencies**: Uses bullets and ID-first order vs. ground truth's numbered list with name-first; includes unrequired title and bolding (-0.5). While not core, these reduce fidelity.
- **Gateway precision**: Omits BPMN-specific abbreviations "(XOR)" and "(OR)" used in ground truth, slightly less precise (-0.5).
- **Extra note**: The Task_ApproveLoan note is accurate but extraneous, as the instructions require strict adherence to headings only (-0.25).

No other additions/removals are missed or fabricated. Overall, the answer is 75% aligned but loses points for the interpretive error and extras, reflecting strictness on even minor deviations.
