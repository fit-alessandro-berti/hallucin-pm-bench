**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **R1**: Status correct; justification similar (≤20 words). +1.7
- **R2**: **Status wrong** (Compliant vs. Violated); misses post-change final approval (07-Mar) linkage to R5, critical misinterpretation. -2.0
- **R3**: Status correct; justification matches closely. +1.7
- **R4**: Status correct; justification equivalent. +1.7
- **R5**: Status correct; justification semantically close but exceeds 20 words (~22) and adds unmentioned Receive_Goods. -0.5
- **R6**: Status correct; justification matches. +1.7
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but lists only 2 violations (misses R2). +1.0
- **Format/Extras**: Deviates heavily (unsolicited event table, re-sorting note, headers, verbose summary > required simple list/table); not "for each rule say [status], followed by ≤20-word justification" + conclusion. -2.3
- **Total**: Major R2 error + format bloat outweigh partial matches; strict deduction for differences.
