4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Positive, ~2 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This matches the ground truth and prompt policy perfectly.
- **Structure and Format (Partial, ~1.5 points)**: The response produces a valid RACI matrix with activities as rows and roles as columns. Abbreviations in the header are acceptable per the prompt's role listings (e.g., "AM"), and the legend is a minor addition not present in the ground truth but not "unwarranted" per the rubric. However, use of "–" for blanks is inconsistent with the ground truth's explicit "I" or "C" entries (implying no true blanks), and the title/intro text adds slight extraneous content. No extra tasks or roles are introduced.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Deductions, ~1 point)**: This is the core failure, with numerous mismatches to the ground truth despite a basic one-Responsible-per-activity structure (which aligns with the narrative). Specific errors (strictly penalized as small differences warrant significant loss):
  - **Receive Application**: CO "I" vs. "C" (-0.5); FC "–" vs. "I" (-0.5).
  - **KYC Review**: AM "I" vs. "A" (-1.0); CO "R / A" vs. "R" (-0.5, unwarranted "A"); FC "–" vs. "C" (-0.5); IT "–" vs. "I" (-0.5).
  - **Order Vetting**: FC "–" vs. "I" (-0.5); IT "–" vs. "I" (-0.5).
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM "I" vs. "A" (-1.0); CO "I" vs. "C" (-0.5); FC "R / A" vs. "R" (-0.5, unwarranted "A"); IT "C" vs. "I" (-0.5).
  - **Record Update**: IT "R / A" vs. "R" (-0.5, unwarranted "A").
  - **Notify Customer**: FC "–" vs. "I" (-0.5).
  These ~10 differences show poor reflection of the narrative's implied consultations/informations (e.g., AM's accountability in KYC/Payment, consistent "I" for IT/FC in several steps). Each activity's RACI does not fully match, violating the rubric's "reflect the narrative" criterion with unwarranted "A" additions and missing entries.
- **Overall Strictness**: The response is a reasonable attempt but riddled with cell-level inaccuracies (no self-awareness issues, as N/A). It captures ~50% of the ground truth correctly (e.g., primary Rs and some R/As) but fails on details, justifying a low-mid score. No criminal/jailbreak concerns.
