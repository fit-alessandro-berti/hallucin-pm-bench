The LLM answer adheres to the strict terminology guidelines—“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” are all used, and the forbidden terms do not appear. The activities and roles are matched to what was assigned.

**However, there are errors with RACI assignments:**

- **Receive Application:**  
  - LLM: AM = R / A, CO = I, FC = –, IT = I  
    *Ground Truth:* AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = I, IT = I  
    **Error:** CO should be C (Consulted) and FC should be I (Informed); FC is blank in the LLM.
- **KYC Review:**  
  - LLM: AM = I, CO = R/A, FC = –, IT = –  
    *Ground Truth:* AM = A, CO = R, FC = C, IT = I  
    **Errors:**  
      - CO should be only R, not R/A.  
      - FC and IT are blank, where they should be C and I.  
      - AM should be A, not I.
- **Order Vetting:**  
  - LLM: AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = –, IT = –  
    *Ground Truth:* AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = I, IT = I  
    **Errors:** FC and IT are missing (should be I).
- **Payment Clearance:**  
  - LLM: AM = I, CO = I, FC = R/A, IT = C  
    *Ground Truth:* AM = A, CO = C, FC = R, IT = I  
    **Errors:**  
      - AM should be A (not I).  
      - CO should be C (not I).  
      - IT should be I (not C).
- **Record Update:**  
  - LLM: AM = C, CO = I, FC = C, IT = R/A  
    *Ground Truth:* AM = C, CO = I, FC = C, IT = R  
    **Error:** IT should be only R, not R/A.
- **Notify Customer:**  
  - LLM: AM = R/A, CO = I, FC = –, IT = I  
    *Ground Truth:* AM = R/A, CO = I, FC = I, IT = I  
    **Error:** FC should be I, not blank.

**Summary:**  
- Terminology is perfect.
- Structure and semantic mapping (no added tasks/roles) is correct.
- Across most activities, the RACI role mapping has omissions (“–” instead of “I” or “C”), and (less severely) some mislabeling (R/A vs R or A, I vs C).
- No forbidden language or extra content.

**Thus, the response is mostly correct, but the RACI assignment errors—especially omissions—are serious, causing a significant deduction.**
