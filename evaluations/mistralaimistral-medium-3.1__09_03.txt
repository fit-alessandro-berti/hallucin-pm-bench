The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core content—correctly identifying the impossibility of computation due to the redacted event log (only headers, no timestamps or rows)—and adheres to the task's requirement for a precise, one-short-paragraph explanation without guessing. It accurately explains the data absence for "Approve Invoice" durations and avoids using external knowledge. Minor deductions for slight over-elaboration (e.g., explicitly deeming the SLA "irrelevant" and adding process-mining context, which the ground truth omits for brevity) and phrasing differences (e.g., bolded summary vs. ground truth's direct "Impossible —"), which introduce negligible but detectable variances under strict evaluation. No factual errors or non-compliance with plain-text response.
