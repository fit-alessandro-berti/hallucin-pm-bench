The LLM answer is fully correct and detailed: it explicitly identifies that all necessary data for the requested calculations are missing from Artefact A, explains the lack of raw timestamps, elaborates that Artefact B’s historical average pertains to a distinct process segment (not the requested activity), and correctly refuses to guess. However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer is longer, adds slightly superfluous process mining context (“Process mining requires instance-level event data,” “no assumptions or external data can substitute”), and elaborates more on the nature of Artefact B than strictly required. While thorough and accurate, that additional detail goes slightly beyond the clear, *precisely* focused, minimal explanation of the ground truth; thus, under strict evaluation, a minor penalty applies.
