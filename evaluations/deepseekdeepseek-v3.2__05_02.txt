The LLM answer correctly identifies the breaching task and attribute to modify (no add/delete violations), provides a valid single-hunk unified diff structure with accurate context lines, and a one-sentence rationale aligned in intent (reduce longest task duration to fix SLA), but loses significant points for: incorrect dueDate value ("P3D" vs. ground truth "P2D"), wrong line numbers in diff hunk ("-17,7" vs. actual ~line 12), added unnecessary file headers ("--- original.xml +++ modified.xml"), and rationale mismatch (generic "end-to-end cycle time" and "3 days" vs. specific "contractual 3-day SLA" with exact numbers and phrasing).
