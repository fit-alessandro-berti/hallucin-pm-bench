The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt by correctly identifying the lack of timestamp data as the reason the average cycle time cannot be determined. It matches the ground truth's core reasoning and structure (one sentence explanation), uses appropriate formatting for the activity name, and avoids any factual errors. Minor deductions for slightly less detailed phrasing (e.g., omits explicit mention of "event counts" or "start-to-completion intervals"), per strict evaluation criteria.
