### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, ~2.0 points)**: The LLM correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions or omissions, and maps them explicitly in "Key Mappings". However, it does not emphasize "mandated wording" in task descriptions as strictly as the ground truth (e.g., no bolding consistency or notes on "without omissions or substitutions"). Minor deduction for not mirroring the ground truth's exact phrasing in notes.
  
- **Table Structure and Formatting (Low, ~1.0 point)**: Markdown table is clear and includes a legend, which aligns somewhat with the ground truth's simpler legend. However, significant differences: LLM uses 3 columns (missing "Operations Manager", a key role in ground truth); tasks are combined (e.g., #5 includes SWIFT transmission, not split; #6 includes "Notification", absent in ground truth); wording varies (e.g., "Receive and Log Transfer Instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Sanctions List Screening" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"). Ground truth has precise, split tasks with mandated bolding (e.g., **KYC Review**). Extra header and mappings in LLM add unrequested elements, deviating from ground truth's concise format.

- **RACI Assignments and Coverage (Very Low, ~0.5 points)**: Major deviations in assignments, failing to match ground truth's logic (e.g., assuming "Operations Manager" for accountability). Examples of differences:
  - Task 1: LLM (Analyst R/A, Liaison C, IT I) vs. GT (Analyst R, Liaison I, Ops A, IT C) – Wrong accountability and consultation.
  - Task 2: LLM (Analyst R/A, Liaison C, IT I) vs. GT (Analyst R, Liaison A, Ops I, IT C) – Misplaces A on Analyst instead of Liaison; ignores Ops I.
  - Task 3: LLM (Analyst I, Liaison R/A, IT I) vs. GT (Analyst C, Liaison R, Ops A, IT I) – Analyst I vs. C; missing Ops A split.
  - Task 4: Similar mismatch (no Ops A; Analyst I vs. C).
  - Task 5: LLM combines release/transmission (Analyst R, IT R/A) vs. GT's "Release Payment" (Analyst R, Ops A, IT C) – Omits transmission; wrong R/A.
  - Task 6: LLM (IT R/A, others I) vs. GT "Archive Record" (IT R, Ops A, Analyst C, Liaison I) – Includes extraneous "Notification"; misplaces C/I; no Ops A.
  All tasks covered from source, but assignments are ~70% mismatched, with no evidence of hierarchical A (e.g., Ops Manager). Small errors like I vs. C amplify to large losses per instructions.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt and Source (Low, factored in)**: Covers every source task without omissions, but introduces unmandated combinations and ignores implied oversight role in GT. Strictness demands near-exact match; cumulative differences (roles, assignments, wording) justify low score. No criminal/offensive issues, but evaluation is purely on accuracy.
