The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in identifying the core issue (no data rows or timestamps in the event log, preventing computation of cycle time, std dev, or CI for "Approve Invoice"). It precisely explains the data absence and distinguishes activity cycle time (requiring start/complete per instance) from irrelevant SLA lead times, adding clarifying value without guessing. Minor deductions for: slightly longer phrasing (not as concise as ground truth's "Impossible —"); explicit mention of SLA (accurate but absent in ground truth, introducing a non-identical element); and phrasing like "per‑activity durations" vs. ground truth's "concrete times for any “Approve Invoice” execution" (semantically equivalent but worded differently, warranting strict penalty per instructions). No factual errors, fully compliant with task (one short paragraph, no tables/guesses).
