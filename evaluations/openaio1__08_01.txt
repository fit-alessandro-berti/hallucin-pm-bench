The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible for T5 to fire before T3, provides a valid and concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3) with accurate marking updates, and offers a brief justification centered on the inhibitor arc's role in enabling T5 when p4=0. This directly addresses the prompt's requirements without factual errors. However, it loses a full point for being less comprehensive than the ground truth: it omits the insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 (if it fires at all) due to permanent disablement post-T3, does not elaborate on T3's token addition to p4 as a one-way disablement, and excludes the optional but illustrative T4 step showing downstream effects. These omissions represent minor differences in depth and completeness, penalized strictly per instructions.
