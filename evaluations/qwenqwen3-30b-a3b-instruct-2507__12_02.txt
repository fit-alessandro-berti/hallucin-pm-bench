7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a valid counterexample from case C003 (lines 6-7), accurately explaining the reversed sequence as a contradiction to the claim, with proper citation of lines and case-ID in a single paragraph as required. However, under strict evaluation criteria, it loses significant points (deducting 2.5) for incompleteness by omitting the second key counterexample from case C005 (line 11, where Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order), which the ground truth explicitly highlights as proof that Validate_Payment does not "always" follow Receive_Order; this omission reduces the comprehensiveness and fidelity to the ground truth, though the provided justification remains factually sound and directly relevant to the log.
