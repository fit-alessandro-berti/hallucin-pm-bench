**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (9.5/10):** Accurately identifies both decision points with correct rules and substance. Minor deductions for phrasing differences ("€250,000 or less" vs. "≤ €250 000"; "votes...to pass" vs. "record 'Approve'" to advance; "approved" vs. "advance"; bullet format vs. numbered) and slightly less precise description of the skip condition (omits explicit "otherwise proceeds" clause).
- **Part (b) - Documents (0.5/10):** Critically flawed. Lists only 5/9 required documents (misses **Scorecard–Cyan**, **Scorecard–Magenta**, **Scorecard–Yellow**, **Signed Offer Sheet 77**). Order is incorrect due to omissions (e.g., **Deck Memo** wrongly #2 instead of #5; skips scorecards that first appear in step 3). Fails to distinguish **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (step 8) from **Offer Sheet 77** (step 7). No hallucinations, but incompleteness and order errors are major failures under strict criteria.
- **Overall:** Weighted average heavily penalized for (b)'s ~56% missing content and structural errors (small errors demand significant loss); total reflects utmost strictness on differences from ground truth.
