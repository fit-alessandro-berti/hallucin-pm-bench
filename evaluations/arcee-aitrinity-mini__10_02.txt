**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically on core requirements, warranting the minimum score under utmost strictness:

- **Vocabulary mandate violations (fatal, multiple instances)**: Retains forbidden terms verbatim in tasks ("*payment clerk*", "the clerk", "*compliance officer*", "**customer due diligence**"), directly contravening "use ONLY the mandated terms... strictly in every output" and "never [those terms]". Ground truth rephrases all to mandated wording (e.g., "**KYC Review**", "Transaction Analyst").
- **Incomplete/invalid RACI structure**: Uses dashes ("-") filling ~80% of cells, rendering it not a functional RACI matrix (no proper Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed assignments across roles). Ground truth fully populates with R/A/C/I and logical assignments (one A per row).
- **Missing roles/columns**: Omits "Operations Manager" and "IT Support" (explicit in source text step 5-6; ground truth includes them). Headers don't match ground truth format.
- **Task phrasing**: Copies informal text verbatim instead of mandated, clean rephrasing (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "Screen Against Sanctions List").
- **No legend**: Ground truth includes explicit "Legend".
- **Partial mappings incorrect/incomplete**: E.g., task 5 assigns only "Transaction Analyst" R (ignores IT Support for SWIFT); task 6 ignores IT archiving; task 4 uses A instead of full RACI.

Even minor attempts (e.g., some role mappings) are negated by pervasive violations; zero tolerance for "strictly" mandated elements.
