9.0  
- The LLM answer is factually correct on all points, with accurate identification of the 3 cases, the preceding activity (Pack_Items), and the unique activity (Cancel_Order).  
- Minor deductions for slight deviations in conciseness and formatting: extra explanatory phrasing in Q2 and Q3 (e.g., "immediately precedes 'Ship_Order'" and "appears exactly once") beyond the minimal ground truth style, and use of numbered bullets with labels instead of the ground truth's labeled asterisk format. These are small stylistic differences but warrant a strict point loss per instructions.
