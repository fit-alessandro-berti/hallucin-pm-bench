8.0

The LLM answer closely matches the required content from the ground truth but shows minor deviations that warrant a noticeable deduction under strict grading:

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time.
- Accurately quotes the required average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each activity; numbers match source table.
- Provides one actionable, data-driven recommendation per activity aiming to reduce waiting time by ≥20%.

**Weaknesses/Issues:**
- The first recommended action (“automated document checklist generation & proactive outreach”) for *Request_Documents* is not as direct or concrete as the ground truth’s “automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation triggers,” and lacks the specificity and escalation guarantee (this softens the precision/type of action).
- The second action for *Send_Closure_Letter* (“Automate letter generation triggered immediately after payment approval/rejection”) is close but omits the key point of “same-day e-signature” letters and specifically replacing “manual batch printing.” The solution is a bit generic and loses actionable detail, though the intent is matching.
- The third action for *Assess_Liability* suggests “prioritizing high-value claims” for senior assessors, while the ground truth recommends rules-engine pre-classification to bypass queues for simple cases. The given answer shifts focus from simple/complex case flow to claim value, which is arguably less relevant to waiting-time reduction for the overall queue and can be considered a material deviation.
- The memo includes non-essential introductory and closing lines (“impacting customer satisfaction…”, “Full supporting data…”) which dilute the crispness and word economy required by the prompt (also, 168 words—just above the limit).
- Omits quoting figures strictly “verbatim” as in the ground truth (e.g., “avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h” exact format).

**Summary:**  
While the answer gets most of the facts and structure right, there are several notable deviations in recommended actions (especially for Assess_Liability), some loss in actionable specificity, and minor non-compliance with the 150-word crispness and precise quoting requirements. These justify a two-point deduction for strictness.
