The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact content matching the ground truth (added tasks, removed task, and both gateway changes). However, it omits the bullet points ("-") before each item in all sections and lacks the alignment spaces in the second gateway entry under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, deviating from the ground truth's formatting. These small formatting inconsistencies warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
