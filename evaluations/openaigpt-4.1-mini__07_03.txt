7.5

The LLM answer lists all required differences and no extra ones, matching the ground truth in substance. However, it fails to include dashes (“-”) before each item, which was explicitly requested by the formatting in the ground truth (“- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)”). This is a formatting error, and per the instructions, even small errors should result in significant point deductions. Otherwise, the content and ordering of the answer are correct.
