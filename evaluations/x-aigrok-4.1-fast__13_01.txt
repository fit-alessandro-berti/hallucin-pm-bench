9.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1**: "1" vs. GT "`1` occurrence" → Minor omission of "occurrence" (small wording difference, but strictness deducts slightly).
- **Q2**: "5.56%" vs. "`5.56 %`" → Correct calculation/rounding, but missing space before "%" (tiny formatting error, minor deduction).
- **Q3**: "A1002" vs. "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”." → Correct identifier listed, but lacks GT's confirmatory phrasing, bolding, and full activity reference (notable brevity difference, moderate deduction).
- **Q4**: Provides exactly two clear, valid sampling reasons matching GT examples (small sample size with specifics from log; temporal bias with accurate ~5-hour span) → Strong match in substance/accuracy, no hallucination, full credit.
- **Overall**: Near-perfect adherence to log data, correct facts, no inferences beyond evidence. Total deductions only for non-verbatim phrasing/formatting (0.5 total loss under utmost strictness).
