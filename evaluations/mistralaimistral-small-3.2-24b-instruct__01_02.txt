6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
This score reflects a strict assessment, penalizing incompleteness and minor deviations heavily. The LLM answer captures the core structure but omits a key decision point, lacks contextual precision, and includes slight phrasing inconsistencies in the documents section. Below, I detail the differences by section.

#### Decision Points (Major Issues - ~4/10 Weight):
- **Incompleteness**: The ground truth identifies **three** decision points: (1) Underwriter Alignment Gate (with specific underwriter names and "tie-break" phrasing), positioned after Dual Underwriter Split; (2) Amount Threshold Decision (explicitly after Neighbourhood Feedback Check, with "send to" phrasing); and (3) Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as a distinct voting decision (approve/reject). The LLM omits the third entirely, treating MBA only as a downstream step in point 2. This is a significant gap, as MBA is a clear branch (approve or reject leads to disbursement or not).
- **Lack of Context and Precision**: 
  - LLM uses generic "two underwriters'" instead of naming "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" (as in ground truth and prompt flow).
  - No mention of "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check," reducing accuracy to the process flow.
  - Phrasing: "proceed" vs. ground truth's "continue" / "send to"; "escalate" vs. "escalate ... for tie-break." These are small but, per instructions, warrant point loss for not mirroring the exact terminology and structure.
- **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the two main gates and uses activity names (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision") without introducing forbidden standard terminology.

This section is ~60% accurate but critically incomplete, justifying a heavy deduction.

#### Required Documents (Minor Issues - ~6/10 Weight):
- **Completeness**: Both list all six required documents from the prompt, with no additions or omissions. No introduction of standard loan docs (e.g., no credit bureau mentions in the list itself).
- **Phrasing Deviations** (small but penalized strictly):
  - "Proof of Address": LLM adds "old" ("≤ 3 months old") vs. ground truth's concise "≤ 3 months" – unnecessary elaboration, though prompt has "≤ 3 months old."
  - "Latest Income Statement": LLM includes "single" ("single pay-stub or tax slip") matching the prompt exactly, but ground truth abbreviates to "pay-stub/tax slip" – minor mismatch.
  - "Community Impact Statement": LLM adds "template" ("CIS template") per prompt, but ground truth shortens to "(CIS)" – slight over-inclusion.
  - Formatting: LLM uses bullets with bolding/parentheses inconsistently (e.g., **ML-APP-01**, **CIS** template); ground truth uses a clean numbered list. LLM omits the ground truth's explanatory note ("No credit bureau report..."), but this isn't required by the prompt.
- **Strengths**: Faithful to prompt's exact items and terminology; no major errors.

This section is ~85% aligned, but strictness on phrasing/formatting costs points (e.g., no numbering, extra words).

#### Overall Structure and Adherence:
- Follows the prompt's directive to summarize decision points and list documents separately, using bolded activity names without standard terminology.
- Minor positives: Concise, well-formatted sections.
- However, the response is shorter and less precise than ground truth, missing ~20-30% of the detail (e.g., no process positioning, incomplete points). Strict policy demands near-exact fidelity, so no bonus for brevity.

Total: A solid but flawed effort—strong on documents, weak on full decision coverage—lands at 6.0, not higher due to the omission's impact.
