5.5

**Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer avoids introducing non-process terminology and uses exact activity names as instructed.
- All required documents are listed, in generally correct format and order.
- The answer identifies the two central decision points: Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision, and explains the branch logic correctly for both.

**Major Problems:**
- **Misses a Required Decision Point:** The LLM answer leaves out “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)” as an explicit decision point. In the process, this is a stand-alone approval step (after Amount Threshold Decision, for loans ≥ €15,000), and its explicit presence as a decision point is required.
- **Context on Underwriter Alignment Gate is Shallow:** It doesn't specify that the gate is *after the Dual Underwriter Split*, nor clarify the meaning of escalation (i.e., that a tie-break decision is made and the process then continues).
- **Omissions in Document Listing:** The required documents are present and correctly named (except for some minor wording discrepancies), but omits to state "complete list," and doesn't explicitly say that *no* other documents (e.g., credit bureau, collateral, etc.) are needed. The ground truth explicitly clarifies this.
- **Does not describe full context/branch for each decision** (e.g., fails to mention that system auto-approves for < €15,000 and that loans sent to MBA are "voted approve/reject").
- **Formatting:** The ground truth provides clear subsection labels (“Decision points”, “Required documents (complete list)”), which helps reader orientation. The LLM answer is somewhat less clear about scope and completeness.

**Minor Problems:**
- “Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)” instead of “pay-stub/tax slip”.
- Slight lack of specificity in document descriptions (“CIS template” vs. “Community Impact Statement (CIS)”).

**Conclusion:**
The LLM answer has the basic logic and all document names, but the omission of a key decision point (MBA), failure to communicate complete process flow, and lack of explicit completeness/clarification in the document list lead to significant point loss. Some minor inaccuracies further reduce the score.
