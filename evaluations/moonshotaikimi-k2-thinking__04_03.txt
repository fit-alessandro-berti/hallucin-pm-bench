The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in correctness, completeness, and structure: it correctly identifies "No" compliance, assesses all four rules with accurate satisfaction/violation reasoning (referencing order, positions implicitly via sequence, and severity), and justifies the overall violation solely on Rule 3. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "executed before" vs. "occurs before"; bullet vs. table format) do not alter meaning or violate the prompt's requirements for a short justification referencing each rule, warranting no deduction under strict evaluation.
