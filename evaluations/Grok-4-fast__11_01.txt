7.0

**Rationale:**

**Positives:**
- The memo correctly identifies the three activities with the longest average waiting times—Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, and Assess_Liability—as per the table and ranks them #1→#3.
- Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each activity are quoted, matching the table.
- Only the three worst activities are discussed, and unrelated activities or metrics are omitted.
- Memo is concise and meets the ≤150-word limit.

**Errors/Losses:**

1. **Actions Not Optimal or Not Fully Aligned to Ground Truth**  
   - For Request_Documents, the proposed action (API integration and instant notification) is logical but differs from ground truth's "automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation triggers," which is more specifically designed to cut queue time on unresponsive cases—a stricter, empirically supported intervention.
   - For Send_Closure_Letter, "batch-process letters weekly" contradicts ground truth (which calls for eliminating batching via instant same-day e-letters); batching could actually worsen waits rather than reduce them for some claims.
   - For Assess_Liability, assigning "dedicated assessors for high-priority" is vague and not as targeted as the rules-engine pre-classification in the ground truth.

2. **Quantification of Wait-Time Cuts**
   - Though the memo claims percentage reductions (25%, 30%, 22%), the rationale is less data-driven than the ground truth’s reference to pilots/estimates. The batching suggestion for closure letters specifically is unlikely to cut wait as asserted and may be misleading.

3. **Minor Formatting/Linguistic Issues**
   - The memo generally fits executive standards but could be more crisp and direct, as in the ground truth.

**Conclusion:**  
Solid identification, numbers, and focus, but substantive errors in two of three remediation recommendations (especially for Send_Closure_Letter) and less specific, empirically grounded actions warrant a significant deduction. Strict scoring per the prompt puts this at 7.0.
