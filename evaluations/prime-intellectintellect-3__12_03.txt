9.5

The LLM answer is factually perfect (correctly identifies No, cites exact counterexamples C002 and C004 with precise sequences and timestamps from the log, notes compliant cases C001/C003 for completeness, and concludes accurately that "always" is violated). It fully meets task requirements (Yes/No + justification via CaseIDs/sequences). However, under utmost strictness, deduct 0.5 for stylistic/presentation differences from ground truth: narrative/lists vs. tabular case-by-case format; explicit "two out of four" quantification absent; minor redundancy in "for completeness" phrasing (though not erroneous). No factual/content errors.
