3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, -1.5 points)**: The four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) are used exactly and correctly without synonyms or leaks. However, added activities use new names ("High-Risk Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Final Notification") that interpret/expand the narrative without strict adherence to "do not rename, merge, or add activities," deviating from the ground truth's precise naming ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). This introduces unauthorized phrasings.

- **Activity Coverage and Structure (Major Deduction, -3.0 points)**: The matrix covers the core four activities but adds/merges/splits others incorrectly (8 rows vs. ground truth's 6), including extras like "Payment Scheduling" and "Final Notification" not distinctly separated in the narrative or ground truth. No merging is evident, but additions violate the "do not add" rule. Prompt specifies "covering every activity and role described," but LLM over-interprets, leading to incomplete fidelity. Markdown table format is used, but introductory text ("Of course. Here is...") is extraneous.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction, -2.0 points)**: Significant mismatches across all rows, even for core activities:
  - Intake Vetting: Front-Office correct (A/R), but Compliance Analyst is "I" (should be "C"); missing Treasury Ops "I"; Officer empty (matches "–").
  - KYC Review/AML Screening: Compliance Analyst "R" only (missing "A"); Officer "A" (should be "C"); missing Treasury Ops "I"; Front-Office empty (correct "–").
  - Risk Scoring: Compliance Analyst "R" correct, Officer "A" correct, but missing Front-Office "C" and Treasury Ops "I".
  - Added rows (High-Risk Approval, etc.): Entirely misaligned with ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" (e.g., Officer "A,R" correct there, but extras like "Payment Scheduling" invent roles not in ground truth). "Release Funds" row misses multiple "C" and "I" assignments.
  No notification activity in ground truth, so "Final Notification" is an invalid addition.

- **Formatting and Precision (Minor Deduction, -0.5 points)**: Empty cells as | | (vs. ground truth's "–"); no bolding for **R,A**; commas in "A, R" (vs. ground truth's **R, A**). Small but strict per instructions.

Overall, the response attempts the task but has structural deviations, extra content, and numerous RACI errors, resulting in low alignment (about 35% match). Strict evaluation penalizes all discrepancies heavily.
