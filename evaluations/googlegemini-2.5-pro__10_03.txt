6.5

- The LLM answer uses only the allowed terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring"): **+1.0**
- No disallowed synonyms ("Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", etc.): **+1.0**
- Activities not merged or renamed—"High-Risk Approval" vs. "Compliance Officer Approval" is a partial mismatch, but the basic activities appear: **-0.5**
- Some activities deviate from the ground truth:
  - The LLM answer introduces "High-Risk Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Final Notification"; however, only "Release Funds" and "Compliance Officer Approval" are required by the ground truth. This creates unnecessary and incorrect activity granularity: **-1.0**
  - LLM omits a distinct "Compliance Officer Approval" row and splits approval and notification into unnecessary extra activities.
  - "Risk Scoring": The LLM gives Compliance Analyst both R and A, when ground truth gives Analyst R, Officer A: **-0.5**
  - "KYC Review" and "AML Screening": LLM gives Officer A, which is not in the ground truth (should be C): **-0.5**
  - "Intake Vetting": LLM gives Analyst A, R only (missing C for Analyst, I for Ops), ground truth includes C for Analyst, I for Ops: **-0.5**
  - Notification is handled incorrectly (adds "Final Notification"); should be I for several roles in earlier activities: **-0.5**
  - "Payment Scheduling" and "Funds Release": LLM merges/splits activities, which isn’t accurate: **-0.5**
- Errors in RACI assignments (see above): **-0.5**
- Presentation clear, Markdown table correct: **+0.5**

**Summary:** The answer avoids forbidden synonyms and uses mandated terms, but it introduces and merges activities not in the ground truth, misassigns some RACIs, and improperly splits/handles notification. Substantial—but not catastrophic—errors result in significant point loss, per the strictness requirement.
