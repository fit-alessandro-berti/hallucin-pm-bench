### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (major deduction)**: The LLM correctly identifies three added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject) but erroneously lists `Task_ApproveLoan` (renamed to "Auto-Approve Loan") as an addition. This violates the "ignore cosmetic renamings" rule, introducing a significant factual error. Ground truth has exactly three; LLM has four with one invalid. Verbose descriptions add unrequested details, deviating from the concise format.
- **Removed tasks (minor deduction)**: Correctly identifies the single removal (`Task_RejectLoan`), but includes extraneous explanation about functionality incorporation, which is interpretive and not in the ground truth.
- **Gateway-type changes (moderate deduction)**: Accurately notes the change from ExclusiveGateway to InclusiveGateway for `Gateway_Decision`, but adds unnecessary details (e.g., name change from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check", flow name updates) that should be ignored as cosmetic. Lacks the ground truth's explicit "XOR" and "OR" terminology for precision. Extra interpretive narrative ("more nuanced decision-making") bloats the response.
- **Overall structure and completeness**: Follows the exact headings and focuses on requested categories without inventing others. Covers all actual changes but inflates with ignored elements and verbosity, reducing fidelity to the minimal, strict ground truth format. No mention of "no other changes," but this is minor. Strict scoring penalizes the core error in additions heavily (loss of ~3 points) and extras (~0.5 points each section).
