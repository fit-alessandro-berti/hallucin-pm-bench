6.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies statuses for R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6, with justifications under 20 words and overall result matching ground truth. However, R2 is entirely incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated), with flawed justification ignoring the post-change approval timing, representing a major compliance misanalysis that warrants significant deduction under strict criteria. Minor variations in phrasing (e.g., R3 lacks dates) add slight penalties.
