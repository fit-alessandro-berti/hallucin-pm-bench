4.5

R1: Correct (Compliant with correct justification).

R2: Incorrect (Should be Violated, not Compliant â€“ LLM failed to recognize that after Change_Request, final approval is the 2nd Manager_Approval on 07-Mar, so Ship_Goods is more than 2 days before that. The LLM mistakenly uses the earlier approvals).

R3: Correct (Violated, justification matches).

R4: Correct (Not Applicable, concise and accurate justification).

R5: Mostly correct (Violated, but LLM says "A new Manager_Approval was required before Ship_Goods but occurred afterwards." The justification is too vague and does not mention that Pay_Invoice also happened before the new Manager_Approval, unlike the ground truth).

R6: Correct (Compliant, justification matches).

Overall result: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).

Major error: R2 misclassified (critical), and R5 justification incomplete (misses Pay_Invoice aspect), causing significant information loss.

Scoring with strictness, these errors are severe and reflect a lack of careful logical sequencing and precise reasoning.

**Final score: 4.5**
