The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and outputs one per line without extraneous content. However, it deviates slightly from the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` by using single spaces instead of double spaces around the em dash (—), and lacks the alignment padding in the second line seen in the ground truth. Under utmost strictness, this minor formatting inconsistency warrants a deduction, though the core content matches perfectly.
