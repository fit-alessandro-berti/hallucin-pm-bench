7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both eligible pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel (*Create_Documentation — Quality_Check* and *Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines*) and ignores Process A as instructed. However, it does not strictly adhere to the required output format:

- Pairs are not aligned and do not use two spaces before and after the em dash as in the ground truth: `Task_X  —  Task_Y`.
- The output lacks the monospacing used in the ground truth, although that is minor.
- The alphabetical order within each pair is correct, as *Create_Documentation* before *Quality_Check*, and *Procure_Materials* before *Schedule_Machines*.
- The order of the two pairs is reversed compared to the ground truth. The ground truth expects *Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check* first, but the LLM’s order actually matches. However, both pairs are in proper alphabetical order overall.

Overall, small formatting deviations (mostly the critical missing spaces around the em dashes) are present; per the instruction to be extremely strict and penalize even minor errors, this warrants a significant deduction.

**Thus, the score is 7.0.**
