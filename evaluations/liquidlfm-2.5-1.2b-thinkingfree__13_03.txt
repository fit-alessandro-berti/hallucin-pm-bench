**3.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Exact match to ground truth ("1"). **10/10**
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Fails utterly. Ground truth provides data-specific reasoning (tiny 14-event sample over 3 cases/<2hrs; frequency swings 0-7%; wide CI; rare-event sampling error; near-synonyms like “Automatic Fraud Check”/“Fraud Check (Automatic)” confuse matching). LLM gives vague platitude ("limited data... overlook trends... underestimation") ignoring all specifics, no quantification, no synonyms, no error types. Misses "misestimate" nuance (could over- or under-). Under 120 words but empty. **1/10** (strict deduction for zero substantive overlap).

**Weighted total: 5.5/10 → Adjusted to 3.0 for extreme brevity/superficiality vs. detailed ground truth.**
