### Evaluation Breakdown
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 4.0/10):**  
The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two actual decision points (the risk-based skip in Step 4 and the TriVote gate in Step 6), with rules that closely match the ground truth in substance (e.g., Low/Medium risk + ≤ €250,000 skips Step 5; any two approvals suffice). However, it erroneously includes the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3) as a "decision point," which the ground truth explicitly treats only as an input/assessment feeding into the true conditional branch, not a gate or branch itself. This adds an invalid third point with a vague description ("determines... for subsequent underwriting") that doesn't capture a rule-based decision. The ground truth strictly limits to two points, so this inflation and misclassification is a significant error, warranting deduction despite partial accuracy.

**Part (b) - Documents (Score: 2.0/10):**  
The LLM lists only 6 documents in correct relative order but omits the three critical inputs to Step 3 (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow), which the ground truth explicitly includes as required documents in first-appearance order. This is a major omission, as these are unambiguously part of the process description. It also fails to note their sequence before the Deck Memo, disrupting the full ordered list (ground truth has 9 items total). Signed Offer Sheet 77 is appropriately distinguished from the unsigned version, but the incompleteness alone is a severe flaw under strict evaluation—no hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions), but profound gaps in coverage.

**Overall Justification:** The response is incomplete and inaccurate in key areas, with small wording alignments unable to offset the structural errors (wrong count of decision points; missing 33% of documents). Strict scoring reflects these as non-trivial failures against the ground truth.
