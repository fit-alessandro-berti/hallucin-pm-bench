**Evaluation:**

a) **Decision Points**
- The LLM answer includes three bullet points, but only two true decision points exist in the process:  
  1. The conditional branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check (whether to skip or require underwriting).
  2. The TriVote approval gate (pass if 2/3 approve).
- The LLM incorrectly characterizes the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a decision point, although per the process description, it is an assessment, not a gate/branch.
- The LLM does, however, properly capture the conditional branch logic and the TriVote rule, but the TriVote description is slightly less precise (uses "to pass" instead of specifying the process can advance only if two of three approve).
- The LLM omits explicit mention of the "otherwise" path in the first conditional (i.e., that Manual-Underwriting-Review is required for High risk or > â‚¬250k), making for incomplete clarity compared to the ground truth.

b) **Required Documents**
- The LLM lists most of the documents but omits the three "Scorecard" documents (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicitly listed as required **inputs** for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check step in the process.
- All subsequently required documents are in the correct order.
- This is a significant omission, as the prompt emphasizes strictness and includes all nine documents in ground truth.

**Summary of errors and point deductions:**
- Marked down for:
  - Counting an assessment as a decision point (+ imprecise statement of decision rules).
  - Not precisely mirroring the rule phrasing.
  - Omitting three required input documents (scorecards), which is a major accuracy fault.

Overall, the answer demonstrates partial but incomplete process understanding, missing both completeness and precise mirroring of criteria, as required by the prompt.
