The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1 and 2 (counts and percentages are precise, with correct calculations and formatting). For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (48 words), addresses the single-occurrence issue ("1 occurrence"), notes variance/instability ("lacks sufficient data for reliable patterns or trends"), and cautions against over-generalization ("overemphasize rare behaviors, skewing process models or predictions"). No inventions or deviations from the log data; it fully satisfies the specified criteria.
