The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No"), matching the ground truth. However, it introduces major errors in the justification: incorrectly claims Rule 1 is violated (QE precedes RA with both occurring once, satisfying the rule despite NA in betweenâ€”the rule requires only order and uniqueness, not consecutiveness); falsely deems Rule 4 violated (CC occurs after NA and VP, and VP is after QE/RA, so it's satisfied); and while correctly noting Rule 3's violation, it overstates by implying broader order issues. These inaccuracies misrepresent two of the four rules (50% error rate), leading to a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria. Omission of explicit satisfaction for Rule 2 (VP after QE/RA for High severity) is a minor additional flaw.
