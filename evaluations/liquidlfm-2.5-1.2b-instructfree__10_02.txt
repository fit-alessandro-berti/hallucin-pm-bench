**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Mandate Violations (Fatal, -4.0 points)**: LLM repeatedly uses forbidden terms ("Payment Clerk" x3, "Compliance Officer" x2) and invents non-mandated terms ("Payment Analysis", "Transaction Analysis", "Approver", "All"). Never uses required "**KYC Review**" for step 3 (CDD). No "**Regulatory Liaison**" or "**Transaction Analyst**". Ground truth uses *only* mandated terms + logical extensions (e.g., Operations Manager, IT Support).
- **Task Coverage & Mapping Errors (-3.0 points)**: Splits step 1 into two rows (unnecessary); omits/excludes logging integration; misassigns screening (step 2: clerk/Transaction Analyst → wrongly Compliance Officer); alters "archives the case file" to "Archiving the case file"; misses "notification" precision for Regulatory Liaison (I). Ground truth precisely maps all 6 source steps without splits/omissions.
- **RACI Assignments Incorrect (-1.5 points)**: Wrong roles/responsibilities (e.g., screening R to Compliance Officer vs. Transaction Analyst; no Operations Manager equivalent; arbitrary "All"; SWIFT ensuring wrongly standalone R to IT Support vs. integrated post-release). Ground truth accurately derives R/A/C/I per source logic.
- **Format & Structure Deviations (-0.5 points)**: Unnecessary title; generic R/A/C/I columns with role names in cells (valid but mismatches ground truth's role-columns/letter-cells); no **Legend**; extraneous false claim ("strictly adheres").
- **Total**: 1.0 (minimal effort/structure, but core mandate/source fidelity obliterated; no partial credit for intent under "utmost strictness").
