**9.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1**: LLM says "One time." Ground truth: "`1` occurrence". Minor phrasing difference (spelled out vs. numeric + "occurrence"); loses 0.3 pts for non-exact match.
- **Q2**: "5.56% (1 of 18 events)." Matches "5.56 %" exactly in value/rounding; parenthetical is extra but accurate, no calculation shown (ground truth includes it). No deduction.
- **Q3**: "A1002." Functionally matches "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”."; concise but omits "only" and full phrasing. Minor loss: -0.2 pts.
- **Q4**: Provides two clear, valid sampling reasons directly derivable from log (non-random/convenience + small N=18; short temporal window lacking variability). Aligns with "temporal bias" and combines "small sample size"/representativeness perfectly ("any two" allowed). No hallucination. Minor loss for not quantifying variance (±5.56 pp.) or using exact ground truth phrasing: -0.3 pts.

**Total**: Excellent fidelity (no hallucinations, all data-bound), but small phrasing/verbosity mismatches deduct per strict criteria.
