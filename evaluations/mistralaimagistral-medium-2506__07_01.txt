6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). However, under strict criteria, it incurs significant point loss for the following mismatches with the ground truth:

- **Formatting inconsistencies (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: Headings use bullets (â€¢) as per prompt, but content lacks the * bullet points and backtick formatting (`id`) used in ground truth. Instead, it uses plain text with inconsistent spacing and parens. Ground truth prioritizes names as primary (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"), while LLM reverses to id-first (e.g., "check_vip (name=...)"), deviating from XML element presentation where `name` is the human-readable label.
  
- **Extra unnecessary text and speculation (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: Includes verbose phrasing in "Removed tasks" (e.g., "removed in v2; present in v1 as"), which adds non-factual commentary not in XML or prompt. The trailing "---" and "*Note: ..." section speculates on unchanged elements and sequenceFlow renumbering, violating "list **only** the factual differences" and "Do **not** speculate." Ground truth avoids this, ending with a minimal disclaimer.

- **Precision errors in XML fidelity (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: Gateway types are capitalized ("ExclusiveGateway" vs. ground truth's lowercase "**exclusiveGateway**" matching XML tags <exclusiveGateway>). Lacks version specifics "(v1) to (v2)" and bolding for emphasis. No "(none)" for empty categories, though not needed here.

These errors, even if minor individually, compound to show incomplete adherence to the prompt's exact structure and XML-exactness, pulling the score below a perfect match (10.0 would require near-identical replication of ground truth format and content).
