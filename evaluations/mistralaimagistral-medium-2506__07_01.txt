9.0

The LLM answer lists all factual differences, under the required headings, using the correct element names and labels, and omits speculation.

**Deductions:**
- The "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" sections use a slightly inconsistent format from the ground truth: the LLM lists label first and id after, rather than the other way around. The LLM omits "id = ..." formatting, instead giving only name and id. Strictly speaking, the instructions require to use the exact element names as in XML, but do not prescribe the precise format for reporting; however, the ground truth includes both label and id in parens, and the LLM's variant, while clear, is not a perfect match.
- The LLM states "check_vip (name="Check Customer VIP Status")" and "generate_qr (name="Generate RMA QR Code")", whereas the ground truth uses bullets and explicit "id = ...". For maximum strictness, this is a small formatting deviation, and should result in a significant deduction.
- The LLM includes an extra note after the headings (“renumbered sequenceFlow ids...”)—this is additional, and not permitted per the prompt to only list factual, element-level differences in the requested format.
- The LLM does not bold any headings or text as in the ground truth, but there is no requirement for markdown.

**No content errors** are present: all changes are accurately captured, and there are no spurious or speculative items.

**Summary:** Only formatting and overly verbose explanations are cause for deduction. Thus, 9.0.
