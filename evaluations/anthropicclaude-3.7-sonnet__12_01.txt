10.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, comprehensive, and closely aligned with the ground truth. It correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate, cites all relevant cases (1001, 1002, 1003) with precise evidence from the data (using timestamps instead of line numbers, which is equivalently rigorous), explains the reversed ordering where both activities appear, notes the absence in Case 1002 to disprove "always," and implies the failure of the "immediately before" condition by demonstrating the opposite sequence. Minor differences in phrasing (e.g., not explicitly reiterating "immediately" in the conclusion or referencing lines) and structure (slightly more formatted but still concise) do not constitute errors, as the core justification is evidence-based, non-speculative, and directly responsive to the prompt without additions or omissions.
