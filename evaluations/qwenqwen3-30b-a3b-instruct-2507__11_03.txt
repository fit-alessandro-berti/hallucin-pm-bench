7.0

The LLM answer identifies the correct three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment), correctly quantifies the SLA breaches and high waiting times for each, and avoids mentioning activities or metrics not present in the table. The structure is coherent and uses bullet points only for recommendations, in line with the instructions.

However, noticeable shortcomings reduce the score:

1. The memo omits references to total case volume (4,805 cases) and the time/sample frame from the source data as the ground truth does ("April 2025 sample"), which establishes analysis credibility—deducting for lack of grounding in all provided data.
2. The recommendations are plausible but slightly less data-driven than those in the ground truth:  
   - For Legal Approval, suggesting a "dedicated legal review team for high-priority cases" isn’t directly based on supplied data (no high-priority breakdown). The ground truth proposes rule-based pre-checks for low-risk files, which can be inferred from throughput and case data.
   - For Risk Review, the LLM proposes a real-time alert system without case-time segmentation from the data. The ground truth recommendation to add a risk analyst in peak periods and automate score retrieval is more directly justifiable from throughput time.
   - For Credit Assessment, the LLM’s recommendation to "integrate automated validation tools for 30% of low-risk applications" invents a percentage (~30%) and a low-risk classification not present in provided data, violating the instruction of, "do NOT invent activities or metrics."
3. The LLM’s memo lacks the explicit projected outcome found in the ground-truth answer (35% cycle time reduction), though "these inefficiencies significantly delay" is a relevant but vague statement.
4. The LLM answer does not specify that the numbers (+300s, etc.) are the amount above the SLA until explained in context, whereas the ground truth is clearer and more direct in its comparative quantification.
5. Wording of the recommendations is less concrete and precise compared to ground truth, which explicitly links actions to the contents of the table.

Due to these issues—particularly minor invention of unsupported figures/criteria (e.g., "30%," "low-risk applications" for Credit Assessment), and less explicit grounding in the full dataset—the answer does not earn full marks but demonstrates credible analytic effort and correct identification of the key process bottlenecks.

Strict grading, as instructed, results in a 3-point loss for these accumulative discrepancies.
