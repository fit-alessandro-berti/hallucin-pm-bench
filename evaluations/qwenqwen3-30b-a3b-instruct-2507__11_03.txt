### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the same three activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) based on SLA breaches and waiting times. Quantifications are exact matches (e.g., +300s for Risk Review and Legal Approval, +60s for Credit Assessment; waiting times cited accurately). Uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations, adhering to that instruction. Stays within table data without inventing absent metrics/activities. Approximate word count (~180) is close to 150.
- **Weaknesses (major deductions for strictness)**: Lacks formal memo structure (no "To/From/Subject" header, as in ground truth), making it feel like a fragment rather than a complete executive memo. Introduction is simplistic and omits ground truth's contextual elements (e.g., total cases reference, "materially breach" phrasing). Activity order differs (Risk Review first vs. ground truth's Legal Approval first), altering emphasis. Recommendations are entirely different and less precisely data-driven (e.g., LLM's "real-time alert at 200s" vs. ground truth's "add one risk analyst to peak morning"; no ties to specifics like "â‚¬25k" or "35% reduction"). No closing projection on impact, missing a key executive summary element. These structural/content deviations (even small phrasing mismatches like "throughput time" vs. "throughput s") compound to show significant divergence, warranting a low-mid score under utmost strictness.
