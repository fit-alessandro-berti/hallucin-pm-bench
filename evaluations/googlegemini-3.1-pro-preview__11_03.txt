### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) in same order, based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times. Quantifies excesses precisely matching GT (+300s Legal, +300s Risk, +60s Credit) and lists waiting times exactly (600s, 480s, 200s). Uses bullets exclusively for recommendations. Stays grounded in table data only (no inventions like GT's case total, date, currency, or % projection). ~160 words ≈150 target.
- **Major differences/Errors (severe deductions)**:
  - **Structure/Phrasing (-2.0)**: Prose paragraphs for activities vs GT's concise bulleted list with bolding/**emphasis**. No subject line; headers differ ("Orion COO" vs "Chief Operating Officer"; "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs "Process Performance Office").
  - **Introduction (-0.5)**: Different phrasing ("Our data identifies..." vs "Analysis of 4 805..."); adds case volumes selectively (465, 1175) not in GT.
  - **Recommendations (-3.0)**: Completely different content/actions (quantified waiting reductions vs GT's process changes like "rule-based pre-checks", "add analyst", "straight-through heuristic"). LLM's are data-driven targets but not matching GT's concrete steps; intro sentence before bullets differs from GT's header.
  - **Formatting/Minor (-0.3)**: "seconds"/singular inconsistencies vs GT's "s"; no markdown bold/italics.
- **Overall**: Core facts match (60% alignment), but structural, stylistic, and full recs mismatch warrant low score under "utmost strictness" and "significant loss for small errors/differences". LLM superior to GT on no-invent rule, but graded purely on divergence.
