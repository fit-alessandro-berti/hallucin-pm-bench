3.0

The LLM answer has serious issues compared to the ground truth:

1. **Missing RACI assignments**: The LLM assigns only **R (Responsible)**, omitting **A (Accountable)**, **C (Consulted)**, and **I (Informed)**. The prompt requests a full RACI matrix, with all assignments reflected (including “R, A” when the same role is both Responsible and Accountable, etc.).
2. **Activities missing or renamed**:
   - The LLM uses "Approval" instead of "Compliance Officer Approval" (lacks mandated term and specificity).
   - "Releasing Funds" and "Release Funds" are minorly different but should match the terminology for maximum accuracy.
   - The activity "Scheduling Payment" appears in the LLM output but not in the ground truth, so this is an unauthorized addition.
3. **Role assignments are incomplete**:
   - For each activity, only one role has “R”; the rest have blank entries, missing the matrix design (e.g., Front-Office Analyst should be “R, A” for Intake Vetting, with others marked as C, I, or dash as appropriate).
4. **Markdown formatting/layout**: Acceptable, but the content does not properly reflect the full RACI assignments.
5. **Vocabulary**: The LLM correctly uses “Intake Vetting,” “KYC Review,” “AML Screening,” and “Risk Scoring.” However, the activity names in the table are not complete matches to the required ground truth (e.g., missing “Compliance Officer Approval” as an explicit row).
6. **Key details missing**: The LLM claims certain RACI indicators (A, C, I) are "not used explicitly in the matrix," which is not actually stated in the user prompt, and contradicts observed ground truth output.

Even though the mandated terminology is respected and no forbidden synonyms appear (preventing a grade of 1.0 or 2.0), the LLM fails to deliver the question’s most critical requirement: a strict, full RACI matrix covering all activities and all roles with complete designations.

Hence, **3.0/10.0**.
