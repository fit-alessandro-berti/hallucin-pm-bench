3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, without leaks of disallowed synonyms (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating" appears). It also covers all roles in the table structure. However, it fails significantly in other areas, leading to a low score under strict criteria:

- **Activities (major deviation, -4 points)**: The prompt requires covering "every activity... described above" without renaming, merging, or adding. The narrative describes: Preliminary Assessment (mapped to Intake Vetting), CDD (KYC Review), Sanctions Check (AML Screening), risk rating (Risk Scoring), escalation/approval by Compliance Officer, scheduling/release by Treasury Ops (implying a combined payment execution step), and notification. The ground truth consolidates these into six activities (e.g., "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"). The LLM incorrectly adds "Scheduling Payment" and "Releasing Funds" as separate activities (adding/merging violation) and uses vague "Approval" instead of "Compliance Officer Approval". This introduces 2 extra/renamed activities, altering the process coverage.

- **RACI Completeness (major deviation, -3 points)**: A full RACI matrix requires assigning Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) across roles for each activity, with blanks/dashes for no involvement, as in the ground truth. The LLM only assigns R (performers) and leaves others blank, claiming "not used explicitly... per user constraints"â€”but the prompt explicitly defines and requires all four (R, A, C, I). This results in an incomplete matrix; e.g., ground truth shows C and I for multiple roles in every activity (reflecting process flow like notifications/escalations), which the LLM omits entirely. No A is assigned anywhere, missing accountability (e.g., Compliance Officer as A for Risk Scoring).

- **Fidelity to Process Narrative (moderate deviation, -1 point)**: Assignments loosely match responsible roles (e.g., Front-Office for Intake Vetting, Compliance Analyst for the next three), but ignore consultations, accountability, and informing (e.g., no I for Treasury Ops on early steps, no C for Compliance Officer on screening). The narrative implies broader involvement (e.g., file movement suggests informing/consulting), which ground truth captures but LLM ignores.

- **Output Format and Extras (minor deviation, -0.5 points)**: Markdown table is used, but adds unrequested sections (Definitions, Notes) that misinterpret constraints and explain omissions. Ground truth is clean, with only the matrix and minimal key points.

- **Strengths (partial credit, +3 points base)**: Correct vocabulary enforcement and basic role-activity mapping provide some alignment, avoiding total failure.

Total: Starts at 7.0 for partial positives, deducts to 3.5 for critical incompleteness and additions. Even small errors (e.g., extra notes) compound under strictness, but vocabulary compliance prevents a 1.0.
