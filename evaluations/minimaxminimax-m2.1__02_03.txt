**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, accurately addressing all three questions with correct facts derived from the log (3 cases listed correctly; Pack_Items immediately precedes Ship_Order for C456; Cancel_Order appears once). Minor formatting variations (e.g., "-" bullets vs "*", no **A1:** labels, "distinct" phrasing matching prompt wording exactly, no header, unescaped underscore) do not constitute errors under the prompt's "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction and do not alter meaning or accuracy. No deductions applied.
