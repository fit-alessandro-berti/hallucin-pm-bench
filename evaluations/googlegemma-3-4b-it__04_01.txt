The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant overall, earning minimal credit. However, it fails catastrophically in justifications, omitting rule 2 entirely (a clear violation per ground truth), incorrectly deeming rule 3 satisfied (distance is 4 events, not â‰¤2), falsely claiming rule 4 is violated (Intern at event 7 follows event 6, not CFO at 3), and inverting the trace order to wrongly violate rule 5 (Ship_Goods precedes Archive_Record). Rule 1 is partially muddled but not egregiously wrong. These errors misidentify violations and omit key ones, rendering the response unreliable and divergent from ground truth.
