7.5

**Evaluation:**

The LLM answer is **largely correct structurally**—all explicitly mentioned flow elements are present, and the parallel, cyclical, and exclusive logic is well-modeled. It produces a BPMN 2.0 XML document with correct use of start/end events, tasks, gateways with correct types, parallel split/join, and the correct parallel flows.

**Strengths:**
- **No major elements omitted**. All flow nodes (tasks, events, gateways) required by the prompt and ground truth are present.
- **Gateways are of the correct types**. Exclusive for claim completeness and warranty check, parallel for split/join.
- **Sequence flow logic** is correct: claim completeness loop, eligibility split, rejection path, and parallel handling.
- **Exactly two end events** are present as required.

**Minor/Critical Errors:**
- **Naming deviations (moderately severe):**
  - The **start event name** is lowercased ("online warranty claim") instead of the required "Online warranty claim submitted".
  - **Task names** do not match **verbatim** with the ground truth—they are lowercased ("validates the claim" vs. "Validate the claim"), in some cases use third person verb ("validates", "checks") which doesn't match the prompt's imperative tense ("Validate", "Check"), or deviate in small ways ("requests missing information" vs. "Request missing information")—this is repeatedly called out as "verbatim" in the prompt and so every deviation is a point-losing error under strict grading.
  - End event names are "Rejection"/"Successful Completion" instead of "Rejected"/"Successful end". These are synonymous but **not verbatim**.
- **Extra elements present**:
  - The LLM provides graphical notation (`bpmndi`, etc.), which is not required; the ground truth omits this. While including DI is not an error, it adds unneeded verbosity and goes beyond "single self-contained document" when not required.
  - Minor superfluous names on exclusive/parallel gateways and tasks could be considered unnecessary, but they're not hallucinated paths or processes.

**Other:**
- **IDs** all have the required “wrc_” prefix.
- **No hallucinated tasks or flows**.
- **Sequence flows** and gateways are configured semantically as required.

**Summary of Deductions (strict)**
- –0.6: For every task/event name not matching prompt/ground truth verbatim (6–7 errors at 0.6 each? Capped at 2.5 points).
- –0.5: For additional unnecessary graphical extensions and markup.
- –0.5: For gateway names ("Parallel Split," etc.) that weren't required by the requirements.

**Conclusion**

**Score: 7.5**
- The answer is functionally sound and (structurally) semantically correct, but repeated *verbatim* naming errors and some excess markup cost several points as required by the "strictness" rule. The prompt explicitly says "**Task names must match the text verbatim**", so all deviations (which are present in all tasks and events) and verbose unnecessary DI cost a significant portion of the score. If these were verbatim, score would be 9.5–10. The submission deserves a **strict 7.5/10**.
