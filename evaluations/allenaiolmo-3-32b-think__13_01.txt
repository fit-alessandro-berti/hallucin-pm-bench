**9.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1 (minor phrasing difference)**: LLM gives "1" (correct count), ground truth "1 occurrence". Deduct 0.2 for missing explicit "occurrence" (small error, significant per instructions).
- **Q2 (notable format omission)**: "5.56" correct numerically/rounding, but question asks for *percentage*, ground truth explicitly "5.56 %". Missing % symbol/unit is a clear deviation. Deduct 0.5.
- **Q3 (phrasing incompleteness)**: "A1002" correctly lists the identifier, but ground truth ideal is fuller ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”."). List question allows brevity, but not exact match. Deduct 0.3.
- **Q4 (strong match)**: Provides exactly two clear, valid reasons directly matching ground truth examples ("small sample size" with specifics on 18 events/1 instance/uncertainty; "temporal bias" on single-day coverage/variations). No hallucination; phrasings aligned conceptually without unjustified inference. Full marks.
- **Overall**: No hallucinations/inferences beyond log (adheres to system rules). Structure clean. Total deductions: 1.0 from 10.0. High fidelity despite minor strict deviations.
