The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Question 1, stating "No" when the ground truth is "Yes," missing the alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) that enables T5 without T3 firing. The explanation for Question 2 is flawed, incorrectly asserting T3 is a prerequisite for T5, ignoring the independent token flow to P4 via T2/T7. No valid sequence is provided, and the reasoning contradicts the Petri net structure, warranting the minimum score for complete inaccuracy.
