7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities as ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), matching the clear data-driven hotspots (throughput drops, extreme waits/rework/SLA breaches). Structure mirrors ground truth closely: numbered list with explanations tied to table metrics and one concrete action per activity. Concise (≈150 words <200). Actions are data-driven and feasible.
- **Major Deductions (strict penalties for errors)**:
  - **Factual inaccuracies in data quotes** (-1.5 total): Review_Documents rework misstated as "9%" (table: 5.3%); Initial_Assessment SLA breach as "1.8%" (table: 3.2%; confuses with rework). These are not "small" errors—direct violations of "based strictly on the table" and ground truth's precision.
  - **Mischaracterization** (-0.5): Initial_Assessment throughput called "low (270 cases/day)" despite being high (second to Register_Claim's 280); ground truth avoids this by focusing on upstream wait/processing/SLA impact.
  - **Minor differences** (-0.5): Lacks ground truth's bolded metrics, upstream congestion emphasis, and projected impacts; slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "outliers" vs. "hotspots").
  
Overall: Strong alignment in intent/selection but compromised by data errors, warranting ~25% deduction from 10.0 under utmost strictness.
