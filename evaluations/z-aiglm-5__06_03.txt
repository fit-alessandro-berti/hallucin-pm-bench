7.5  
The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, numbers them in order, and stays focused without mentioning A or C. However, it loses points for:  
- Using "and" instead of the precise "‖" notation for parallelism (-1.0).  
- Lacking descriptive labels like "Set 1 – first parallel block" (-0.5).  
- Missing the explicit closing statement "No other tasks..." confirming completeness (-0.5).  
- Minor formatting differences (bold on tasks vs. code blocks; unnecessary intro sentence) (-0.5).  
Core content matches, but strict format and notation deviations warrant deductions.
