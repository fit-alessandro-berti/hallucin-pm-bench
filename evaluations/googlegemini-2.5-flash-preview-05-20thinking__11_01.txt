7.0

The LLM answer is broadly correct in ranking and quantifying the top three activities by waiting time (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability – with correct averages and 95th percentile numbers), and it does not mention service time or unrelated activities. 

However, applying strictness per instructions:

- The recommendation for "Request_Documents" is reasonable but less crisp and specific than the ground truth. The original specifies "automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation," citing evidence from pilot tests. The LLM reply lacks this concrete trigger or benchmark.
- For "Send_Closure_Letter," the LLM suggests automation but doesn't specifically mention switching to e-signature or same-day delivery; "automate generation and dispatch" is vaguer than the original and leaves ambiguity regarding actual changes from the current process.
- For "Assess_Liability," "standardize assessment criteria and tiered workflows" is plausible, but less targeted than "rules-engine pre-classification so simple cases bypass queues."
- The actions allude generally to ≥ 20% reductions but do not provide test/pilot data or precise projected percentages as in the reference.
- Structure and concise adherence to memo format are achieved. All data (avg and p95) are reported verbatim and nothing irrelevant is introduced.

Each less-specific action and omission of concrete, data-driven benchmarks and mechanisms as in the model answer dock at least a point each. No severe factual errors, but the absence of specifics, less forceful linkage to ≥ 20% reductions, and the lack of pilot-based confidence prevent a higher score.

Hence, a 7.0 – solid but notably short of exemplary precision and rigor.
