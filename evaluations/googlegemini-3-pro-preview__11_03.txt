6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer aligns well with the ground truth in core requirements: it correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, quantifies excesses accurately (+300s for Legal and Risk, +60s for Credit), uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations, and sticks to ~150 words while grounding in table data without inventions (e.g., no fabricated totals like GT's "4 805 cases" or projections). Structure is memo-like with To/From/Subject.

However, strict deductions for differences:
- **Introduction and descriptions (-1.5 points)**: LLM's phrasing is more summary-focused (e.g., "most severe total duration" without explicitly stating throughput values like GT's "average throughput **900 s** vs. 600 s SLA") and lacks GT's bolded activity names, queue emphasis, or sample period in subject. Waiting times are noted but not listed per activity as in GT.
- **Recommendations (-2.0 points)**: Major divergence; LLM's actions are data-driven (citing specific wait/throughput figures) but vague/generic ("investigate bottleneck," "restructure queue," "target waiting time"), lacking GT's concrete, specific interventions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst"). No shared actions or projected impacts.
- **Format and extras (-0.5 points)**: No bolding, no "Recommended actions" header (GT has it), minor wording variances (e.g., From line, subject). LLM avoids GT's inventions, which is faithful to prompt but creates content gaps.

Overall, strong on identification/quantification (70% match) but weaker on descriptive detail and recommendation specificity, warranting a mid-range score under strict criteria.
