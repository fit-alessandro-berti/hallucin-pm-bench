The LLM answer is accurate on questions 1 and 2 (exact match to ground truth numerics and calculations, with proper rounding). For question 3, the response adheres to â‰¤100 words, addresses the single-occurrence issue, notes instability (e.g., skewing metrics, bias in sampling leading to unreliable patterns), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., underrepresentation, need for full data validation). However, it introduces minor unsubstantiated inferences (e.g., "delays in C05" not evident in timestamps; "fast approval" subjective without explicit log support), slightly deviating from the ground truth's focus on statistical noise/variance and wide confidence intervals, warranting a deduction despite strong overall alignment.
