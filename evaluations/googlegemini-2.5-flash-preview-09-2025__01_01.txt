4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially addresses the prompt but has significant omissions and inaccuracies when strictly compared to the ground truth, warranting a substantial deduction under the utmost strictness criterion (even small errors, like incomplete branching logic or undocumented artifacts, lead to major point loss). Here's a breakdown:

#### Strengths (Supporting ~4.5 Score)
- Identifies two of the three core decision points accurately in structure and location: (1) Eligibility validation in Step 2 (matches GT #1), and (2) High-value threshold check after Step 3 (matches GT #2).
- Correctly avoids introducing undefined activities (e.g., no mention of legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide").
- Lists some relevant documents per decision/activity without fabricating new ones (e.g., correctly ties *RefundRequestForm*, *FlightManifest*, *WeatherReport* to eligibility; *EligibilityChecklist* to threshold; *AuditTrail* and *BankTransferAuthorization* to later steps).
- Uses clear markdown tables for readability, aligning with summarization intent.

#### Major Errors and Omissions (Deductions)
- **Incomplete Decision Points (Major Loss: -3.0)**: Identifies only "two distinct decision points," missing the third and critical "Final payment approval" at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** / **Senior_Auditor_Review** (GT #3), which explicitly handles approval/rejection branching before **Process_Refund_Payment**. This is a core constraint in the process description (payment only after successful approvals), and omitting it fails to "summarise every decision point." Branching logic is also underdeveloped—even for identified points, it lacks explicit outcomes like "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → reject" (GT #1) or "≤ €1 000 → skip" (GT #2), reducing completeness.
- **Incomplete/Inaccurate Document List (Major Loss: -2.0)**: The prompt requires listing **all required documents** explicitly as a complete catalogue. LLM fragments this across tables (per-decision and "subsequent"), omitting **RefundConfirmationPDF** entirely (used in Step 6: **Issue_Confirmation_Letter**). It also doesn't compile a full, unified list like GT's (which includes all 7: *RefundRequestForm*, *FlightManifest*, *WeatherReport*, *EligibilityChecklist*, *AuditTrail*, *BankTransferAuthorization*, *RefundConfirmationPDF*). Minor addition: Infers "*EligibilityChecklist* (containing the approved amount)"—not defined in the process, introducing unsubstantiated detail (small error, but strictness demands -0.5 equivalent via overall deduction).
- **Minor Structural/Interpretive Issues (Additional Loss: -0.5)**: Phrasing like "the system/process determines" for the threshold is vague (GT specifies "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**"). No explicit note on *AuditTrail* being conditional (GT clarifies "only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue"), and no closing disclaimer on "no other documents or legacy activities" as in GT.

Overall, the answer covers ~60-70% of the content accurately but critically fails on exhaustiveness (all decisions and full document list), which the prompt mandates. A perfect score requires near-identical completeness; this is a solid partial response but not comprehensive.
