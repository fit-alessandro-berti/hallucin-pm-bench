### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1 (Accuracy)**: The LLM correctly identifies the count as 1, matching the ground truth exactly. No deduction here (full points equivalent).
- **Part 2 (Explanation Quality and Adherence)**: Significant deviations warrant a substantial deduction under strict criteria. The LLM's response (92 words, within limit) touches on sample shortness and automatic variants but introduces speculation (e.g., "conditional or less frequent," "trigger a follow-up," "bypass... straight to manual")â€”violating the system's "no speculation" rule, which the ground truth avoids. It misses core ground truth elements: tiny sample size (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), frequency volatility (0% to 7% swing), wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events, and specific risks of strict vs. fuzzy string matching with near-synonyms. Instead, it qualitatively infers process logic without data support, diluting analytical rigor. These omissions and additions create moderate-to-high divergence, justifying a lowered overall score despite partial overlap on limited timeframe and variants.
