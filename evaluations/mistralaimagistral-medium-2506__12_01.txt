The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in verdict (both deem the fact inaccurate/false), structure (case-by-case evidence-based justification), and key details (correctly identifies reversed ordering in cases 1001 and 1003, absence in 1002 disproving "always," and no instance of the claimed sequence). It adheres strictly to the data without guessing. Minor deductions for slight additions beyond the requested "short justification" (e.g., explicitly stating an unprompted "correct pattern" and irrelevant mention of Refund_Issued in case 1002) and less precise formatting (no explicit line references, though timestamps suffice as evidence), but these are small deviations without factual errors.
