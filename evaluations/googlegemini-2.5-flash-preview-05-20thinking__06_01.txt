The LLM answer lists the correct two pairs allowed to be executed in parallel in Process B. However, it fails to strictly comply with the required output formatting:

- **Missing spaces for alignment**: The ground truth uses two spaces padding around the dash (`—`), and aligns the task names for readability, as required by the prompt instructions and shown in the ground truth.
- **Order within pairs**: The LLM answer writes the pairs in correct alphabetical order within the pair (e.g. “Create_Documentation — Quality_Check”, “Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines”) which matches the alphabetical requirement.
- **Order overall**: The LLM answer matches the overall pair order of the ground truth, consistent with instructions.
- **Format**: The LLM answer omits the exact format shown in the ground truth (aligned with padding for each task and the specified spacing around the dash).

Given the prompt's requirement for utmost strictness, missing the specified output format (particularly the spaces and alignment) constitutes a significant error, justifying a loss of about 4 points from a perfect score, even though the substantive content is otherwise correct.
