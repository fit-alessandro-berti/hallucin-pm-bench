7.5

### Evaluation Notes (for transparency, not part of the scored response):
- **Correctness of overall answer**: The LLM correctly identifies the trace as "No" (non-compliant) and pinpoints Rule 3 as the key violation, aligning with the ground truth.
- **Strengths**: Accurate assessment of Rules 2, 3, and 4, including reasoning. Conclusion correctly emphasizes Rule 3's impact.
- **Weaknesses (strict deductions)**: 
  - Major flaw in Rule 1: Contradictory phrasing ("Violated" followed by "technically satisfied") creates confusion and inaccuracy. Introduces irrelevant concern about "other activities interfering with strict sequencing," which misinterprets the rule (it only requires order and uniqueness, not exclusivity). This is a significant error in justification, warranting a ~2-point deduction.
  - Minor issues: Slightly verbose/hedging language; format differs (list vs. table) and lacks the clean ✔/❌ markers, reducing precision (-0.5).
- **Overall**: High alignment on outcome and most rules, but Rule 1 error prevents a top score under strict criteria.
