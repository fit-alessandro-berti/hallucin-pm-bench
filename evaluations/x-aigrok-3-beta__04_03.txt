9.0

**Evaluation:**

The LLM answer is accurate, clear, and directly addresses each rule, coming to the correct non-compliance conclusion. The answer provides justification for each rule, correctly noting that:

- Rule 1: Is satisfied (“technically satisfied” with a slightly awkward phrasing, but correctly identifies that QE and RA both occur, and in the required order).
- Rule 2: Is satisfied.
- Rule 3: Is violated and clearly explained.
- Rule 4: Is satisfied.

**Notable Issues:**
- There is some unnecessary, slightly ambiguous language in the justification for Rule 1: “other activities interfere with the assessment of strict sequencing…” (which is not required, since only the order of QE and RA matters, not the activities between them). The sentence “this rule is technically satisfied as QE precedes RA” is true, but the extra wording might confuse a strict process auditor (the ground truth is more succinct).
- The tabular format of the ground truth answer is absent, and some of the language is less precise than the gold standard.
- For the “justification,” the ground truth uses a clearly laid-out table for clarity. The LLM’s answer is slightly less structured but functionally accurate.

**Summary:**  
All substantive content matches the gold standard and the conclusion is correct. The only deductions are for minor imprecisions, the lack of concise tabular/structured format, and slightly confusing phrasing in Rule 1 justification.

**Strict grading applied: 9.0**
