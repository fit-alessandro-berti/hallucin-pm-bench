The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth: correct "Yes" for Q1, same minimal sequence ⟨T1, T2, T7, T4, T5⟩ demonstrating T5 before T3, accurate explanation of the P1-P3-P4-P5 path preserving P2 token. Concise (∼70 words <120 limit), directly addresses both questions.

Minor deductions (-0.5): lacks explicit Q1/Q2 labels, numbered steps, intermediate markings (M₁–M₄ for verification), and confirmatory note on T3 disablement. Format less structured than ground truth, but prompt requires only "ordered list of transition names" (provided), not markings. No factual errors.
