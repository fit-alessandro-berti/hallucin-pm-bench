6.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s)—core matching ground truth. Quantifies excesses accurately. Uses bullets *only* for recommendations. Memo format and ~150-word length appropriate. Grounds most in table data.
- **Major deductions (-2.0)**: Completely different recommendations (no overlap in actions; LLM's are generic automation/staffing vs. ground truth's specific pre-checks/analyst timing/heuristic—big content divergence). 
- **Significant errors (-1.0)**: Invents unprovided metrics (% over target: 50%, 100%, 25%) violating "no metrics not provided"—strict loss. Interpretive case mention ("480 of 1,175 assessed cases") adds unsubstantiated narrative.
- **Minor differences (-0.5)**: Phrasing/structure varies (e.g., no bold throughput values like "**900 s** vs."; different headers/From/closing; extra cycle time claim). No total cases or projections matching ground truth.

Semantically ~70% aligned but textual/precise violations prevent higher score under utmost strictness.
