**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary adherence (mandated terms)**: Perfect match (10/10). Uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst” exactly; no violations like CDD or Compliance Officer.
- **Task coverage and phrasing**: Partial (5/10). Covers all source tasks (8 rows including splits for SWIFT/notify, faithful to source details like "transfer instruction", "sender and beneficiary", "case file"). Ground truth has only 6 rows, omits explicit SWIFT sending and notification as tasks, rephrases (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" omits "log"; "Archive Record" vs. "case file"). LLM better covers "every task" from source but differs from GT phrasing/structure.
- **Table format/structure**: Poor match (2/10). Uses standard vertical R/A/C/I columns (valid Markdown RACI style) with title/notes/legend-like explanations. GT uses horizontal roles columns with **R/A/C/I** symbols in cells, different header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), legend format, bolding. Introduces mismatch; GT invents unmandated "Operations Manager" (nowhere in prompt/source).
- **RACI assignments**: No match (0/10). LLM assigns R/A to same performing role per task (logical but simplistic, empty C/I except final). GT distributes across invented roles (e.g., Operations Manager as frequent A; Analyst C for KYC). Zero tasks align (e.g., KYC: LLM Liaison R/A; GT Liaison R/Ops A/Analyst C/IT I).
- **Overall fidelity/extras**: Low (3/10). Markdown table present; covers source comprehensively without omissions/inventions beyond source (IT Support from text). Extras (title, detailed notes) helpful but diverge from GT's minimalism. Core RACI content/format differs fundamentally.

**Total: 3.0** (significant losses for mismatched format, assignments, and structure despite vocab/task strengths; strict penalty for non-identical output per criteria).
