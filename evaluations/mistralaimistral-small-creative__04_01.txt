**2.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" (matching ground truth), but the justification is fundamentally flawed and diverges sharply from the ground truth:

- **Factual error**: Claims event #6 (`Goods_Received`) was executed by **CFO**, but the trace explicitly states **Warehouse_Clerk**. This alone warrants major deduction under strictness.
- **Wrong rule violation**: Cites **Rule 4** as violated, but ground truth confirms Rule 4 is **satisfied** (Intern at #7 follows Warehouse_Clerk at #6, not CFO; prior CFO at #3 has intervening events).
- **Misses actual violations**: Ignores **Rule 2** (violated: `Risk_Assessment` at #9 follows `Ship_Goods` at #8) and **Rule 3** (violated: `Three_way_match` at #10 is distance 3 from `Goods_Received` at #6, exceeding ≤2).
- **Incomplete analysis**: Fails to assess all rules (ground truth systematically checks 1–5, noting satisfactions and violations), providing only a single, incorrect point instead of comprehensive, accurate justification.
- **Format partial match**: Uses "Non-compliant" + numbered list citing a rule, but content is irrelevant/wrong, violating the intent of "cites the relevant rules."

Verdict match prevents a 1.0, but errors are severe (fabricated violation, missed real ones, factual inaccuracy), justifying low score.
