**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally invalid BPMN 2.0 XML and fails to model the process correctly:

- **Structural errors**: Nested `<definitions>` (invalid); non-BPMN elements like `<gateways>` wrappers, `<incomingEdge>`, `<outgoingEdge>`, `<decision>`, `<thenBranch>`, `<elseBranch>`, `<condition>`; duplicated `sf10`; invalid `fromRef`/`toRef` on some flows; `title=` instead of `name=`.
- **Missing/invented elements**: No "Provide Reset Instructions" task; start event separate from submit (invents extra "Customer Submits Ticket" task); specialist path invents "Resolve Issue by Specialist" (should reuse "Resolve Issue"); ends incorrectly from diagnosis; no proper conditionExpressions (uses fake attributes).
- **Flow errors**: Password reset path broken (gw1 refs undefined `a5`, skips to wrong targets); no flow from reset instructions to confirm; gw2 misplaced (after forward, but desc has resolve/forward after diagnosis); loop uses fake `<decision>` branching to diagnosis but with invalid refs/conditions; no gw3 for customer confirm; ends prematurely.
- **Violations**: Adds unmentioned elements (e.g., separate specialist resolve task); exceeds concise ≤40 lines with junk; doesn't use exclusive gateways properly for both decisions or loop as described; XML won't validate/parse.
- **Ground truth diffs**: ~90% mismatch in elements, IDs, flows, conditions; hallucinates non-BPMN syntax instead of standard sequenceFlows with `conditionExpression`. Total failure.
