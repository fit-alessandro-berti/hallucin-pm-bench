**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision Points (major partial credit, -2.5 deduction)**: LLM identifies 2/3 key decision points from ground truth (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision correctly named and described in substance, using exact terminology). However:
  - Misses **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** entirely (GT's #3: explicit approve/reject vote).
  - Wrong order (Amount before Alignment; process/GT flow is Alignment → Amount → MBA).
  - Adds unnecessary process step references ("step 6", "step 8") not in GT or required.
  - Lacks GT's precise contextual phrasing (e.g., "branch after Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") and formatting (bold, ⇒ arrows).
- **Required Documents (strong match, -0.3 deduction)**: Lists all 6 exactly as in process/GT. Minor wording diffs penalized strictly:
  - "≤ 3 months old" vs. GT's "≤ 3 months" (extra "old").
  - "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. GT's "pay-stub/tax slip" (extra "single").
  - "(CIS) template" vs. GT's "(CIS)" (extra "template").
  - Misses GT's "(complete list)" header and explanatory note (emphasizes "no standard loan documents", aligning with prompt's "do not introduce standard loan terminology").
- **Overall Structure/Formatting (-0.0 further)**: Clean lists, follows prompt (exact activity names, no standard terminology introduced). No hallucinations.
- **Strictness Applied**: 10.0 = pixel-perfect GT match. Big miss (MBA + order) costs heavily; minor doc tweaks add loss despite fidelity to source process. Total aligns ~75% match → 7.2.
