The LLM answer incorrectly places a non-interrupting timer on `Task_Triage` (which cannot monitor time from submission, as Triage occurs later in the process) instead of an interrupting timer on `Task_Receive` to track from the start. It escalates by skipping to `Task_Notify` (bypassing Triage entirely, violating the SLA's core requirement to reach Triage), rather than jumping directly to `Task_Triage`. The "48-hour cycle" is unclear and non-standard for a one-time SLA timer. While it avoids new tasks and uses a timer/flow, these fundamental errors in placement, type, target, and SLA compliance prevent effectiveness, warranting severe deduction.
