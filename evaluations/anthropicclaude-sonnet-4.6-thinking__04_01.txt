8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the verdict ("Non-compliant") and accurately classifies all 5 rules (satisfied for 1,4,5; violated for 2,3), matching the ground truth. Justifications cite relevant rules, events, and trace details correctly, with similar phrasing (e.g., reversed order for Rule 2). However, under utmost strictness:

- **Significant deduction for Rule 3 distance calculation**: LLM states "distance **4**" for event 10 (counting sequential positions post-event 6: 7=1,8=2,9=3,10=4). Ground truth states "distance = 3" (consistent with intervening events: 3 between 6 and 10). This is a clear numerical error in justification, despite correct violation conclusion.
- **Format deviations**: Required " “Compliant” or “Non-compliant”, followed by a numbered justification". LLM uses heavy Markdown (##, ###, **bold**, ✅/❌, table, dashed lines, repeated "Verdict" section), verbose headers ("Rule-by-rule analysis"), and non-plain numbered list. Ground truth uses plain "Justification" with numbered 1-5 bold rule refs and concise overall summary. Extra elements deviate from specified format.
- Minor: Rule 4 analysis correct but less precise than ground truth's direct predecessor check; extra table in Rule 2 unnecessary.

Core compliance correct (9.5+ potential), but small numerical error + format issues warrant -2.0 per strict criteria.
