9.0

The LLM answer accurately lists both sets of tasks that can execute concurrently and does so in the correct order. The formatting and naming are correct, mirroring the process logic. However, the LLM answer omits explicit reference to "parallel block" or "parallel construct" labels, and does not add a clarifying statement such as "No other tasks... can run in parallel" (as in the ground truth). These are relatively minor omissions, but under utmost strictness, they merit a deduction. Thus, the score is 9.0.
