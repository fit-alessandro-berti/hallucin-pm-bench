The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in the exact order and with the precise task names, fully complying with the prompt's focus on listing and numbering without extraneous information. However, it loses points for minor but noticeable deviations from the ground truth: using plain "and" instead of the parallel symbol "‖"; omitting the descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"); lacking backticks for task names; and excluding the confirmatory statement ("No other tasks..."), which ensures completeness under strict evaluation. These formatting and stylistic differences, while not altering the core accuracy, reflect in a deduction for imperfect alignment.
