6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Under strict evaluation criteria, the LLM answer captures the core elements of the prompt (identifying decision points and listing documents without introducing undefined activities or artifacts) but incurs significant deductions for incompleteness, inaccuracies in framing, and lack of depth in summarizing decision points. Here's a breakdown of key differences from the ground truth:

#### Decision Points (Major Deductions: ~3.0 points lost)
- **Identification and Number**: Both identify three decision points, which aligns broadly. No extras introduced, avoiding violations of the prompt.
- **Depth and Accuracy**:
  - LLM's #1 (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility) describes the decision superficially ("Whether the claim is eligible") but omits explicit branching logic/outcomes (e.g., "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → claim rejected/returned"), which the ground truth mandates as essential for summarizing decision points. This is a critical omission, as decision points inherently involve branches.
  - LLM's #2 (Finance_Controller_PreApprove) frames it as an isolated approval decision, but the ground truth integrates it into #3 as part of "Final payment approval" (with explicit branches: "Approved → Process_Refund_Payment; Rejected → process ends"). This misaligns the sequence and misses rejection paths.
  - LLM's #3 (High-Value Threshold Check) correctly notes the €1,000 threshold but doesn't specify its timing ("after Finance_Controller_PreApprove") or full branching ("Amount > €1 000 → include Senior_Auditor_Review; Amount ≤ €1 000 → skip"). It treats this as a standalone "check" rather than a post-PreApprove branch.
  - Overall, LLM lacks the tabular structure and explicit "Branching logic / outcomes" from ground truth, resulting in shallower summaries. No mention of rejection/end paths in multiple points, which ground truth covers comprehensively. Small errors like vague phrasing (e.g., no "final payment approval" synthesis) compound to significant loss.
- **Extra Content**: The closing note on Process_Refund_Payment restates constraints accurately but is extraneous to the prompt's focus, slightly diluting focus (minor deduction).

#### Required Documents (Minor Deductions: ~0.5 points lost)
- **Completeness**: Lists all seven documents correctly (RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF). No introductions of undefined artifacts.
- **Differences**:
  - LLM uses bullets with step references (e.g., "(Step 2)"), while ground truth uses a clean numbered list without steps. This adds unrequested detail, but it's not erroneous.
  - Both note AuditTrail's conditional use (LLM: "for high-value claims"; ground truth: "only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue"). However, LLM doesn't explicitly frame it as "part of the catalogue" or add the ground truth's disclaimer "(No other documents or legacy activities...)".
  - Minor formatting variance (bullets vs. numbers) and lack of the exact closing parenthetical note reduce precision.

#### General Strictness Factors
- **Fidelity to Prompt**: LLM stays within bounds (no legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" or extras), but summaries are not as exhaustive or structured as ground truth, missing the "utmost" detail in decision logic.
- **Strictness Impact**: Even small issues (e.g., omitted rejection branches, imprecise sequencing) warrant ~0.5-1.0 point losses each per criterion. Total alignment is ~65% due to incomplete branching and framing, yielding 6.5. A perfect match would require identical structure, explicit outcomes, and phrasing.
