**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a) (partial credit: ~5/10)**: Identifies both decision points correctly but with errors. First point is mostly accurate (minor notation nit: "€250K" vs. "€250 000"), but second severely misstates the rule—claims it "requires approvals from all three" without noting "any two suffice to pass" (directly contradicting process description and ground truth phrasing). Lacks precise one-sentence rule summaries matching ground truth.
- **Part (b) (minimal credit: ~1.5/10)**: Catastrophically incomplete—lists only 4/9 documents (misses all three Scorecards, Deck Memo, Signed Offer Sheet 77). Order is invalid due to skips (e.g., jumps from step 1 to 7). Extraneous sentence ("These documents...") adds irrelevant content. No hallucinations, but omissions are disqualifying.
- **Overall**: Formatting mimics ground truth superficially, but substantive differences (rule inaccuracy + 55% document omission) warrant major deduction under strict criteria. Small errors (e.g., "€250K") alone cost ~0.5; larger ones dominate.
