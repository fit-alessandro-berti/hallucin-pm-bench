The LLM answer is factually correct (Yes, same minimal 5-step sequence T1→T2→T7→T4→T5 reaches {P2,P5}, enabling T5 pre-T3). Explanation accurately summarizes the P1-branch independence.

Differences causing deduction (-0.8 total):
- No intermediate markings (ground truth lists M₁–M₅ explicitly, proving reachability step-by-step; LLM asserts without verification, minor imprecision under strictness).
- Presentation: Inline arrow sequence vs. numbered list; "Answer 1/2" vs. "Q1/Q2"; summary "Why" vs. integrated explanation + disabling note.
Minor formatting/style variances, but core matches closely. Under 120 words.
