The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel sets with the exact tasks from Process B, in the proper order, adhering to the prompt's focus without mentioning other processes. However, it incurs deductions for minor formatting differences from the ground truth: using simple comma separation instead of the ‖ symbol for parallelism notation, lacking descriptive bolded headers (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), omitting backticks around task names, and excluding the confirmatory sentence "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." These small deviations from the ground truth's structure and completeness warrant a noticeable but not severe point reduction under strict evaluation criteria.
