The LLM answer accurately identified both sets of concurrently executable tasks in Process B and presented them in the correct order. However, it omits explicit references to the parallel constructs ("first parallel block", "second parallel block") and does not specify that no other tasks can run in parallel, unlike the ground truth.

These omissions—minor though they are—represent a lack of full correspondence to the ground truth's clarity and completeness, warranting a significant but small deduction when strictness is applied.
