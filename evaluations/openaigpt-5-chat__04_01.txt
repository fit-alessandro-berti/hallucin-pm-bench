The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying "Non-compliant" status and the exact same violations (Rules 2 and 3) with appropriate citations, while confirming satisfaction of Rules 1, 4, and 5. Justifications are detailed, numbered, and align closely with the ground truth in structure, content, and reasoning (e.g., correct event references for approvals, reversed order in Rule 2, and positioning in Rule 3). Minor deductions for: (1) imprecise distance phrasing in Rule 3 ("4 steps after" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"), which introduces a small numerical discrepancy despite correct violation conclusion; (2) addition of a "Conclusion" section not present in ground truth, slightly deviating from the requested format; (3) minor wording variations (e.g., "Approve_PO_CFO" vs. ground truth's "CFO at event 3"; bolding inconsistencies). These are small but warrant point loss under strict evaluation criteria.
