7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Accuracy (high marks)**: The LLM correctly identifies all factual differences: added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, and the gateway change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive. No extraneous or speculative content is added, aligning with the prompt's restrictions.
- **Differences from Ground Truth (point deductions)**:
  - **Task Descriptions**: LLM uses only IDs (e.g., `- `check_vip``), while ground truth includes full names from the XML `name` attribute (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)*"). This omits key readable details present in the XML, leading to a significant loss (~1.5 points) for incompleteness under strict evaluation.
  - **Gateway Formatting**: LLM includes XML tags with angle brackets (e.g., `<exclusiveGateway>`), which are not "element names exactly as they appear" (the prompt/XML uses just the name like "exclusiveGateway"). Ground truth avoids brackets and adds version context "(v1) to (v2)", making LLM's version imprecise (~0.5 points loss).
  - **Structure and Headings**: LLM uses plain headings (e.g., "Added tasks") and hyphens for bullets, while ground truth uses bolded headings (e.g., "**Added tasks**") and asterisks for list items, plus a trailing note. This mismatches the "exact headings" requirement and overall presentation (~0.5 points loss).
- **Overall Strictness**: No major factual errors, but multiple small deviations in detail, exactness, and formatting accumulate to prevent a perfect score. The response is functional but not as comprehensive or precisely formatted as the ground truth.
