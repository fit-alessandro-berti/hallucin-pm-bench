**8.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria)
- **Strengths (aligning closely with GT and prompt)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), justified by table metrics (low throughput, high wait/processing/stdev/rework/SLA). Explanations cite specific table values strictly (e.g., Request_Documents: 150 min wait, 22% rework; Review_Documents: 25 min processing, 12.4% SLA). Provides one concrete, data-driven action per activity, benchmarked to table (e.g., <30 min vs. Review_Documents' 30 min; stdev 2 min vs. Approve_Claim). Concise memo format ≤200 words (148). No hallucinations or extraneous activities.
- **Weaknesses/Deductions (significant per strictness rule)**:
  - Factual error: Initial_Assessment SLA breach labeled "second-highest" (3.2%); actually **third** (behind 12.4%, 5.5%) – -0.8 points.
  - Incomplete explanation for Initial_Assessment: Omits its 12 min processing (second-highest, as in GT); relies on subjective "highest early-stage" wait (18 min is third overall, after 150/30) – weaker "why" vs. GT's upstream congestion tie-in – -0.5 points.
  - Minor divergences from GT phrasing/emphasis: Less focus on Review_Documents' 30 min wait; actions/projections differ (e.g., LLM's staffing/automation vs. GT's digital/AI/triage; 20% throughput vs. 10%/40% SLA) but remain valid/data-driven – -0.3 points.
  - Superfluous elements: Full memo header/Date/word count not in GT (slight bloat) – -0.2 points.

Overall: Highly similar (same activities, data fidelity), but factual inaccuracy and explanation gaps prevent perfection under utmost strictness.
