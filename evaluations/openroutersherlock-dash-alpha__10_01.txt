2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with no forbidden terms appearing. The activities listed match the process description without extras, and no additional roles or columns are introduced. However, the RACI assignments deviate significantly from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Major errors in RACI allocations (core content failure, -5.0 points)**: 
  - Each activity in the ground truth includes multiple "C" (Consulted) and "I" (Informed) assignments across roles, reflecting nuanced involvement implied by the process narrative (e.g., Account Manager as Accountable or Consulted in several steps). The LLM omits all "C" and "I" entirely, using dashes to imply no involvement, which ignores the collaborative aspects and mismatches the ground truth completely (e.g., every activity in ground truth has at least 2-3 "C/I" entries).
  - Incorrect "A" (Accountable) assignments: For "KYC Review", LLM assigns "A" to Compliance Officer (CO) instead of Account Manager (AM); for "Payment Clearance", "A" to Finance Clerk (FC) instead of AM; for "Record Update", unwarranted "A" to IT Support where ground truth has none (only "R" for IT). This violates the rubric's emphasis on allocations reflecting the narrative, where AM often holds accountability.
  - While each activity has exactly one "R" (Responsible) matching the performer from the description (partial credit), the lack of separation between "R" and "A" where needed (e.g., ground truth splits them for KYC and Payment) compounds the inaccuracy.

- **Format and presentation issues (minor but penalized strictly, -1.5 points)**:
  - Uses "R,A" without slashes (vs. ground truth's "R / A"), bolding inconsistently (e.g., all "R,A" bolded vs. selective bolding in ground truth).
  - Adds a title ("Order-to-Cash Workflow RACI Matrix") and a full RACI legend, which are unwarranted extras not present in the ground truth or prompt (rubric notes no extra content).
  - Column headers include abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") vs. ground truth's plain full names.

- **Partial correctness (baseline +1.0 point)**: Terminology and basic structure (rows/columns/activities) are intact, with one "R" per activity aligning loosely with the narrative's "handled by" phrasing.

Overall, the answer captures only ~25% of the ground truth's detail (terminology and "R" assignments), but fails on the matrix's primary purpose (comprehensive RACI mapping), resulting in a 2.5 score. Even small omissions like missing "C/I" or format tweaks deduct heavily per instructions.
