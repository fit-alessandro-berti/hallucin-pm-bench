**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict grading per instructions):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct overall structure with required start event, 2 exclusive gateways (claim completeness + warranty decision), parallel split/join pair, exactly 2 end events, all IDs prefixed "wrc_", all required tasks present (no omissions), correct parallel flows, rejection path, success path, loopback logic for incomplete claim semantically matches requirements.
- **Major deductions (significant point loss for strictness)**:
  - **Hallucinated/extra flow elements** (-2.0): Added unmentioned `intermediateCatchEvent` ("wrc_wait_for_info") + 2 extra sequence flows ("wrc_flow5", "wrc_flow6"). Requirements state "requests missing information and waits [...] before re-validating" but specify **only** listed gateways/events/tasks—no explicit wait event. Ground truth uses direct loopback task→task (no extra event), as per "model **only** explicitly mentioned" and "do **not** invent [...] beyond what is stated." This is a clear hallucination.
  - **Output format violation** (-1.0): Prompt demands "**single self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document**." LLM prefixes with prose ("Here's the BPMN..."), wraps in ```xml block, adds post-explanation. Ground truth is pure XML.
  - **Task name mismatches** (-0.5): Not verbatim per prompt/description. E.g., "validate the claim" vs "**validates the claim**"; "request missing information" vs "**requests missing information**" (removed 3rd-person 's'). Ground truth alters too (capitalizes/infinitive) but closer to expected convention.
- **Minor deductions** (-0.5 total):
  - Namespace/style diffs: No `bpmn:` prefix (uses default NS, potentially less standard/parsable than ground truth's prefixed). Extra unused `xmlns` (bpmndi/omgdc/omgdi). Different `targetNamespace`/IDs/names (e.g., start "Start" vs "Online warranty claim submitted"; gw names vary).
  - Non-minimal (ground truth: 34 lines, ~15 flows; LLM longer with extras).
- **No credit for extras like flow labels/names**: Semantically OK but deviates from minimal ground truth.
- **Total**: Starts at 10, deducts to 6.0. Semantically ~90% equivalent but strict rubric penalizes extras/format/name precision heavily.
