The LLM answer is factually accurate, covers all three cases with correct observations on ordering (reversal in 1001 and 1003) and absence (1002), and directly contradicts the claim including the "immediately" aspect implicitly through sequence analysis. It adheres to the prompt's request for a short justification citing case IDs and activities (using timestamps for evidence, which effectively demonstrates order). Minor deductions for stylistic differences: lacks the ground truth's bulleted structure, explicit line references (though not required by the prompt), and a more emphatic final summary phrasing on "none of the cases" and "immediately precede"; these are small variances but warrant a slight reduction under strict evaluation criteria.
