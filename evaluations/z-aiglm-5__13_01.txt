**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1 (Perfect match, minor deduction for unnecessary extra detail)**: Core answer "1" matches exactly. Extra "(appears explicitly only once, in line 7)" is accurate (verifiable from log lines) but exceeds the concise ground truth "`1` occurrence", introducing non-essential info. Strict policy: small extras cost points (-0.2).
- **Q2 (Near-perfect)**: "5.56%" matches "`5.56 %`" semantically; calculation identical and correctly rounded. Minor formatting diff (no space before %) is a small error (-0.1).
- **Q3 (Excellent match)**: "**A1002** (This is the only case...)" is functionally identical to "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”." Slight phrasing variation but captures essence precisely (0 deduction).
- **Q4 (Strong, but not verbatim)**: Provides two clear sampling reasons matching ground truth categories ("Small sample size" via "Insufficient Sample Size: 18 events/single day/high variance implied via extrapolation issues/statistical insignificance"; "Temporal bias" via "Timeframe Bias: few hours/specific day, lacks daily/seasonal representativeness"). Reasons are derived solely from log (18 events, one day 2025-05-01 ~09:00-14:00). However, not exact phrasing (e.g., misses "four cases/high variance ±5.56 pp" specificity; adds "week-vs-weekend/end-of-month" which is reasonable but slightly inferential beyond strict "no infer events"). Covers "any two" well but strict diff in articulation (-0.2).

**Overall**: 95% alignment (no hallucinations, all data-faithful, answers every question accurately). Deductions only for minor extras/formatting/phrasing variances per "utmost strictness/small errors significant loss". No policy violations.
