The LLM answer aligns closely with the ground truth in core conclusion (impossibility of computation) and reasoning (absence of temporal data like timestamps or durations), directly addressing both prompt questions without fabrication. Minor deductions for slight phrasing variations (e.g., "cycle time (i.e., the duration)" vs. ground truth's broader "cycle-time calculation"; explicit mention of historical benchmarks' irrelevance, which is implied but not stated in ground truth) and formatting differences, per strict evaluation criteria.
