3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer attempts a BPMN XML structure but deviates significantly from the ground truth and prompt requirements, resulting in a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Structural Errors (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: 
  - The "Provide Reset Instructions" task (id="reset") has no outgoing sequence flow, causing a dead-end path that violates the process flow (should connect to "Confirm with Customer" as in ground truth f5: t2 → t6). This breaks the model for the password reset scenario.
  - Gateway gw2 lacks outgoing flows to both "Resolve Issue" and "Forward to Specialist" with proper conditions; only a flow to "resolve" exists, leaving "forward" disconnected from gw2 (invented flows from forward → specialist → resolve are misplaced). Ground truth uses f7 (yes → t4) and f8 (no → t5).
  - Duplicate/incorrect flows from "confirm": One to gw3 (correct) but an extra direct flow to "end" with a condition (bypasses gw3, altering logic). Ground truth routes confirm → gw3 → end (f11, f12) or loop (f13).

- **Invented Elements (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Added unmentioned "Specialist Work" task (id="specialist"), violating the "Do not invent... activities" rule. Ground truth implies specialist work via direct flow (f9: t5 → t4) without a separate task.
  - Invented conditions like `class == "Password Reset"`, `class != "Password Reset"`, `persists == true`, `persists != true`, and `confirmed == true` instead of simple "yes"/"no" as in ground truth (e.g., f3/f4, f7/f8, f12/f13). This adds unmentioned logic.

- **Missing/Incorrect Elements (Moderate Deduction: -1.0 points)**:
  - No sequenceFlow IDs (ground truth uses f1–f13 for all flows).
  - Gateways lack names (e.g., gw1 should be "Password Reset?"; gw2 "Resolved Internally?"; gw3 "Customer Confirms?").
  - Task names imprecise: "Classify Ticket" vs. ground truth "Auto-Classification"; no name for start ("Ticket Submitted") or end ("Ticket Closed").
  - Loop modeled to "diagnose" (correct per line 9), but conditions are invented/wrong.
  - Process attributes differ: id="supportProcess" isExecutable="true" vs. ground truth "support_ticket" isExecutable="false"; targetNamespace="AcmeTech" vs. "http://acmetech/support".

- **Minor Issues (Minor Deduction: -0.0 additional, as cumulative)**:
  - No <?xml declaration (ground truth has it, but prompt doesn't mandate).
  - XML is under 40 lines (~35), but bloated by errors.
  - Only two exclusive gateways (gw1, gw2, gw3—wait, three? Prompt specifies "two decision points"; LLM has gw1 for classification, gw2 for diagnosis outcome, gw3 for confirmation—extra gw3 not flagged as "two," but description implies three decisions. Ground truth has exactly three gateways for the three decisions, so this is neutral but inconsistent with "two" prompt phrasing—minor mismatch).

The model captures ~60% of the core flow (start → classify → gw1 split → diagnosis → resolve/forward → confirm → gw3 split/loop → end) but fails on completeness, accuracy, and fidelity to "exactly as stated." No hallucinations like timers/escalations, but inventions and breaks justify a failing grade equivalent (3.0 reflects partial skeleton with critical flaws).
