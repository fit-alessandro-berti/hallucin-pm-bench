7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in capturing the core content but incurs deductions for omissions and minor phrasing variances relative to the ground truth, evaluated with strictness as instructed. Key differences:

#### Decision Points (partial match, ~7/10):
- **Strengths**: Correctly identifies all three decision points using exact activity names (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)"). Logic flows (e.g., ≤2 difference, <€15,000 threshold, approve/reject vote) align closely.
- **Differences/Deductions**:
  - Omits contextual positioning: Ground truth specifies "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for #1 and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for #2; LLM lacks this, reducing process-flow accuracy (significant loss for strict evaluation of completeness).
  - Formatting and precision: Ground truth uses arrows (⇒) for branching logic and bold/capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**"; LLM uses simpler parentheses and italics (*approve* or *reject*), plus adds extraneous phrasing like "the loan" in #3 and an intro sentence ("Here's a summary..."), which deviates from ground truth's concise structure.
  - No introduction of standard terminology, which is good, but overall less precise than ground truth's enumerated, detailed format.

#### Required Documents (strong match, ~8/10):
- **Strengths**: Lists all six exact documents in the ground truth without additions or omissions. Uses bullet points (vs. ground truth's numbering), but this is minor formatting.
- **Differences/Deductions**:
  - Phrasing variances from ground truth (though they match the original prompt more closely): "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. "≤ 3 months" (adds "old"); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (adds "single" and changes "/" to "or"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (adds "template"). These are small but require point loss per instructions.
  - Omits ground truth's extra note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which emphasizes the process's non-standard nature; while not explicitly required by the prompt, its absence is a completeness gap against ground truth.
  - Ground truth labels it "(complete list)"; LLM does not, but implies completeness.

Overall score averages the sections, penalizing for strict adherence to ground truth's structure, context, and exact wording—core elements are present (80% alignment), but omissions and tweaks prevent a perfect score.
