**Score: 7.0**

**Evaluation:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3, which is the correct high-level conclusion.
- It provides a correct concrete firing sequence: T1, T2, T5, T3, and shows the markings after each firing.
- The basic logic that T5 needs p3 to have a token and p4 to have zero is stated.

**Deficiencies:**  
- The answer does not explicitly recognize or state that firing T3 **necessarily disables T5 permanently** (since once p4 gets a token, T5 is never again enabled, because p4 is never emptied except simultaneously with p3 by T4)—a key structural reason that T5 can only fire before T3 and only under those conditions. This insight is a major part of a complete minimal proof.
- The LLM answer is a bit verbose and sometimes repetitive in describing basic preconditions, but does not sharply spell out the *necessity* as in "T5 must fire before T3 if it ever fires".
- The answer does not briefly note the impact on the reachability graph or explicitly remark that after T3, T5 is *permanently* disabled (whereas the ground truth does).
- It does not describe the consumption of tokens precisely after T5 fires (i.e. that p3 is emptied), nor does it mention whether T5 can ever re-enable.
- The legend for inhibitor arcs is repeated but not referenced again in the proof or explanation.

**Strictness:**
- The primary error is *lack of a formal, crisp justification for necessity* (“...must fire before...”) and a missing explanation about the permanent disabling of T5 after T3. While the LLM answer is correct in process, it fails to fully justify why T5 can only fire before T3, which the prompt insists upon. In strict grading, this must result in a substantial deduction.
- The firing sequence is correct and shows the right insight (hence not a failing score), but the missed formal justification costs several points.

**Summary:**  
- Accurate sequence and diagrams: **+3**
- Correct high-level conclusion (“Yes”): **+2**
- Adequate enabling/disabling logic for T5: **+2**
- Lacks proof of necessity (T5 must fire before T3), no mention of permanent disabling, less formal reasoning: **-3**
- Verboseness and lack of clarity in key steps: **-1**

**Final strict score: 7.0**
