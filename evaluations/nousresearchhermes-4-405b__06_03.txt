The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks in the specified order, with no factual errors or extraneous information about other processes. However, it includes an unnecessary introductory sentence, parenthetical explanations (not requested in the prompt), and plain formatting without the ground truth's bold labels, backticks, or parallel symbol (â€–), resulting in minor stylistic and structural deviations that warrant a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria. The absence of the ground truth's closing sentence (which affirms completeness) is a negligible omission since the prompt does not explicitly require it.
