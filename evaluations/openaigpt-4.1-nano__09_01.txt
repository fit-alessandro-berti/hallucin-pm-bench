The LLM answer is accurate, clearly stating that the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be computed from the provided data, due to the lack of timestamps or durations. The explanation is correct and justifies why the calculation cannot be performed. The only minor deviation is that the LLM refers to "cycle time" as needing start and end timestamps "for each occurrence," whereas the ground truth more strictly emphasizes the complete absence of any temporal value and specifically mentions the impossibility of computation in any sense. This is a subtle nuance, since the LLM could be interpreted as suggesting that partial cycle time calculations might be possible with “start or end” timestamps (whereas at least one is necessary), but the practical impact is negligible.

Because the answer is essentially correct, complete, and aligns closely with the ground truth, but is not a word-for-word match with the slight distinction in reasoning emphasis, a 0.5 point deduction is applied for maximum strictness.
