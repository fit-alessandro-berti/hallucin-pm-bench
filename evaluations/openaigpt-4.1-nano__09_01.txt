The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly refusing to provide a numeric value and explaining the absence of necessary temporal data (timestamps/durations) as the reason, adhering to the system's instruction to only answer if supported by the data. Minor deductions for slight wording variances (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed"; omission of "ordering information" and explicit warning against fabrication) and not explicitly addressing the multi-part query structure, which introduces small but noticeable differences under strict evaluation criteria.
