3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **R1**: Status and justification match closely (correct sequence of approvals for high-value PO). No deduction.
- **R2**: Major error—status incorrectly "Compliant" (should be "Violated"); justification ignores impact of Change_Request requiring new approval on 2025-03-07, misidentifying last approval as 2025-03-04 and failing to assess Ship_Goods timing relative to it. Critical violation of rule logic, causing -4.0 points.
- **R3**: Status and justification match (correct timestamp violation). No deduction.
- **R4**: Status and justification match (correctly NA due to hazardous=false). No deduction.
- **R5**: Status correct ("Violated"), but justification incomplete—omits Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) as a further processing step before new Manager_Approval, focusing only on Ship_Goods. Partial match, causing -1.0 point.
- **R6**: Status and justification match (correct termination). No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct ("NON-COMPLIANT"), but undermined by R2 error affecting compliance assessment.
- **Format**: Adheres to bolded statuses, ≤20-word justifications, and all-caps conclusion; table not required by prompt. Minor deduction (-0.5) for not mirroring ground truth structure exactly, per strictness.
- **Total**: Strong on 4/6 rules, but R2's fundamental misanalysis (inter-rule dependency) and R5 incompleteness warrant severe penalty under utmost strictness guidelines.
