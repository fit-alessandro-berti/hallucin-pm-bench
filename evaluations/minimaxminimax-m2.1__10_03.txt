**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, ~3/10)**: Correctly uses all four mandated terms (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) exactly once each, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms. However, adds unauthorized activity names (e.g., "High-Risk Escalation Review", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Originating Analyst Notification").
- **Structure & format violations (0/10)**: Adds title (# header); 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6; no bolding on activities or **R, A** cells; uses "I" universally for uninvolved roles instead of "–"; splits/merges activities differently (e.g., separate escalation/payment/notification rows explicitly forbidden by "do not rename, merge, or add activities").
- **Activity coverage (1/10)**: Covers the four core activities but incorrectly infers/expands others (e.g., no "Compliance Officer Approval" or "Release Funds"; adds non-matching extras like "Payment Scheduling (non-escalated)").
- **RACI assignments (1/10)**: Major mismatches even on first four rows:
  | Activity       | Matching cells |
  |----------------|----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | 2/4 (CA: I vs. **C**; CO: I vs. –) |
  | KYC Review     | 2/4 (FOA: I vs. –; CO: I vs. **C**) |
  | AML Screening  | 2/4 (same as KYC) |
  | Risk Scoring   | 1/4 (CA: **R, A** vs. **R**; FOA: I vs. **C**; CO: I vs. **A**) |
  - Remaining rows entirely absent/mismatched.
- **Overall fidelity**: ~25% cell-level similarity on core rows, but prompt requires exact coverage of **every activity** without additions/changes. Cumulative errors (additions, wrong inferences, format, assignments) warrant severe deduction under "utmost strictness" and "small errors reflect in significant loss."
