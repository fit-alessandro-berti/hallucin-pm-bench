**9.0**

The LLM answer is functionally identical and correct, providing the exact same BPMN improvement (interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` with 48h duration routing to the existing `Activity_AMReview`), with a nearly matching one-sentence justification. Deductions for minor XML differences (-0.5: missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` to match original/ground truth style; -0.3: different `id` attributes, boundary event `name`, absence of explanatory `<!--` comments with ❶/❷ numbering; -0.2: minor formatting like ```xml block and justification phrasing/label not bit-for-bit identical). No semantic or compliance errors.
