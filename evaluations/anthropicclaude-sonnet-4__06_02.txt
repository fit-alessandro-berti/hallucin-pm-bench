The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names and sequencing, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it includes an unnecessary introductory sentence, which deviates from the prompt's strict instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" (implying no additional text), resulting in a minor format violation under utmost strictness. No other errors in task enumeration, exclusivity to Process B, or exclusion of sequential tasks.
