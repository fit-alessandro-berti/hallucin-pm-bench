**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high alignment, minimal deductions):**
  - Identifies exactly the 3 correct decision points using precise terminology: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
  - Conditions/outcomes match ground truth semantically (e.g., ≤2 vs >2 points equivalent; auto-approve <€15k vs ≥€15k to MBA; board approve/reject).
  - Lists **all 6 required documents** verbatim from source prompt, more faithfully than ground truth in some phrasings (e.g., "(CIS) template", "(single pay-stub or tax slip)").
  - No introductions of forbidden standard terminology; sticks to given names.

- **Deductions (significant for small errors/omissions under strictness):**
  - **-0.5**: Omits positional context in #2 ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") and #1 ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split")—explicit in ground truth.
  - **-0.3**: Minor phrasing diffs in docs vs ground truth (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs "pay-stub/tax slip"; no "(complete list)" or trailing note).
  - **-0.2**: Added verbosity/extras (e.g., "the file escalates/proceeds", "reviews the application", sub-bullets, italics vs bold)—not in ground truth's concise style.
  - **-0.1**: Formatting diffs (### headers + bullets vs #### + inline/numbered; *** separator).
  - **-0.2**: #3 condition adds "(for amounts ≥ €15 000)" (accurate but extra vs ground truth's implication).

Semantically near-perfect (content fidelity ~98%), but strict policy penalizes all observable differences proportionally. No major errors (e.g., wrong points, missing items).
