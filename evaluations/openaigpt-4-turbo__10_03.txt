**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance**: Perfect (10/10). Uses exactly “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”; no leaks of disallowed terms.
- **Coverage of activities**: Major failure (-4.0). Prompt requires covering **every activity** described (narrative implies 6 distinct: the 4 mandated + "Compliance Officer Approval" escalation + "Release Funds"/scheduling/notify). LLM only covers 4, omitting 2 critical ones. "Do not ... add activities" prohibits extras but does not excuse incompleteness.
- **RACI assignments**: Severe inaccuracies across all rows (-2.5). E.g.:
  | Activity | Key Differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Missing Front-Office **A** & Compliance **C**; blanks ≠ "–". |
  | KYC Review | Missing Compliance **A** & Officer **C**. |
  | AML Screening | Same as KYC (Compliance **R** only, missing **A** & Officer **C**). |
  | Risk Scoring | Missing Front-Office **C**. |
  No coverage of remaining activities.
- **Formatting**: Multiple small-but-significant errors (-0.5). Header "Activity/Role" ≠ "Activity"; blanks ≠ "–"; no **bold** on activities/**R,A**; misaligned columns.
- **Output structure**: Extraneous content (-1.0). Added intro ("Below is..."), RACI legend, and explanatory paragraph; prompt specifies **only** "Return the matrix as a Markdown table".
- **Overall**: Partial credit for vocab/table skeleton, but wholesale deviations from ground truth (missing content, errors) yield low score under "utmost strictness".
