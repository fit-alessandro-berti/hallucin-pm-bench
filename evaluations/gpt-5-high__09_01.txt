10.0

The LLM answer receives a score of 10.0 because it precisely matches the ground truth in content, structure, and strictness:

- It clearly states that the average cycle time cannot be derived from the provided data.
- It offers a detailed and correct explanation, explicitly mentioning the absence of necessary timestamp or duration fields, and correctly ignores the irrelevant benchmark data.
- It does not attempt to fabricate an answer or infer data not present.

There are no errors, omissions, or unwarranted extrapolations; even minor details are perfectly aligned with the ground truth.
