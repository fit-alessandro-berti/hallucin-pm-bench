The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in refusing to provide a numeric value, correctly citing the absence of timestamps/durations as the core reason impossibility, and emphasizing that derivation is not feasible. Minor deductions for slight structural differences (numbered response vs. single paragraph) and additional detail on the benchmark (not in ground truth, though factually correct and relevant), but no substantive errors or fabrications.
