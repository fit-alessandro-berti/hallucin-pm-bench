### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core content of the ground truth but introduces several discrepancies, particularly in structure, completeness, and precision, warranting deductions under strict criteria:

- **Decision Points (major section, ~60% weight)**: Score 6.5/10. 
  - Correctly identifies and describes the three primary decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval), with accurate branch logic (e.g., ≤2 points difference, <€15,000 auto-approval, board vote).
  - Significant errors: Treats "Harmonisation Committee" as a standalone decision point, which the ground truth integrates as a sub-step/escalation within the Underwriter Alignment Gate—violating the prompt's emphasis on exact flow and activity names without introducing extras. Omits explicit sequencing (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), making the summary less precise about process flow. Minor: Does not bold/capitalize "Approve" or "Reject" as in ground truth; phrasing like "continue to NFC" is implied but not positioned as clearly in ground truth.

- **Required Documents (minor section, ~40% weight)**: Score 8.5/10.
  - Lists all six items correctly, matching the complete set without additions or omissions.
  - Small wording errors (significant per instructions): "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (adds "single" and "or" vs. "/"); " (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (adds "template"). Omits the ground truth's explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which reinforces the prompt's non-standard focus and lack of typical loan docs— a completeness gap. Formatting uses bullets vs. ground truth's numbered list, reducing alignment.

Overall, the answer is substantively strong (no major factual errors or introduced standard terminology) but loses points for structural deviations, extra sub-element promotion, and minor phrasing mismatches that dilute fidelity to the ground truth.
