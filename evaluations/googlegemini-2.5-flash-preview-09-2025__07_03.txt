8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes in content (added tasks, removed task, and gateway type changes), matching the ground truth exactly on verifiable differences without extras or omissions. However, under utmost strictness, the absence of bullet points ("- ") before each item in all three sections constitutes a formatting difference across 6 total list items, warranting a deduction (2.0 points total: 1.0 for inconsistent list structure and 1.0 for lack of alignment in the gateway section, where the ground truth uses spacing for the second entry). No other errors.
