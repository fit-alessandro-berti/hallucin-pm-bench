The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No") and provides a valid counterexample (Case C004) with the relevant sequence, sufficiently disproving the "always" claim under strict logical evaluation. However, it deducts points for incompleteness: it omits the second counterexample (Case C002, where Pack_Items intervenes), failing to match the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case analysis across all four cases. This partial justification, while adequate for refutation, lacks the exhaustive detail expected for a "meticulous process-mining analyst," resulting in a strict deduction despite no factual errors in the cited evidence.
