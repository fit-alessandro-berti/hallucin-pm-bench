**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a): High fidelity (9.5/10)**  
  - Identifies exactly 2 decision points, matching ground truth.  
  - Rule summaries are accurate to the process description and nearly verbatim in logic/content:  
    - #1: Precise match on condition (Low/Medium **AND** ≤ €250k skip), with minor extras ("Outcome Gate" title, "Step 5" reference, "loan amount" vs "requested amount", "skip/proceed" vs "bypasses/proceeds").  
    - #2: Accurate ("any two suffice"), faithfully reflects process ("requires all three" clause included, unlike ground truth's paraphrase); minor phrasing divergence ("only two out of three" vs "at least two... record 'Approve'").  
  - One small error: Currency "€250,000" (comma) vs ground truth/process "€250 000" (space) → -0.5.  
  - Each is one clear sentence; no omissions/hallucinations.

- **Part (b): Near-perfect (9.0/10)**  
  - Exact 9 documents, precise order of first appearance, no extras/omissions/hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML).  
  - Matches ground truth list verbatim (including "Signed Offer Sheet 77" distinction).  
  - Deductions for additions not in ground truth: parenthetical step references (e.g., "(Step 1: *Receive-Application*)"), verbose header, italics/bolding → -1.0 (unnecessary verbosity under strict diff matching).

- **Overall Structure/Formatting (9.5/10)**: Clean, labeled (a)/(b), but extra markdown (###, **bold**, italics, --- separator, gate numbering/titles) deviates from ground truth's concise style → minor -0.5 cumulative.  
- **Total**: Excellent accuracy/content (no substantive errors), but strict diff-matching penalizes phrasing/formatting minutiae/small notation variance → 9.2 (not 10.0).
