9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks within Process B, matching the two parallel splits described in the prompt and ground truth. The sets are also numbered sequentially as instructed. However, minor issues lead to a deduction:

- The answer omits explicit reference to "parallel block" or "parallel construct", using only "sets," which causes a very slight loss of precision compared to the ground truth.
- The notation used is less formal (it does not use "â€–" or explicitly label the blocks).  
- The LLM answer introduces a small amount of non-essential wording ("Here are the sets..."), rather than matching the extremely succinct and structured format of the ground truth.

These are small errors but warrant a point deduction given strictness expectations. The core content and order are correct; thus, 9.0.
