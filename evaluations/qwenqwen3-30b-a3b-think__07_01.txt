6.0

• Added tasks  
The LLM answer lists only the element names ("check_vip", "generate_qr") but does not provide the full task names or clearly include the IDs in parentheses as the ground truth does. This omission of full names and less explicit ID formatting is a significant detail loss.

• Removed tasks  
As above, the LLM answer lists only the element name ("send_rma_label") without the full descriptive label ("Send RMA Label") or the id formatting. Again, critical context is lost compared to the ground truth.

• Gateway type changes  
The LLM answer is accurate in reporting "gw_valid (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway)", matching the correct identification and direction of change as in the ground truth, though the formatting could be more explicit.

The LLM answer does not overreport or introduce extra details, which is good. However, the absence of full task names, missing explicit ID-and-name pairs, and less formal formatting of headings and items means it falls short of the strict detail and accuracy of the ground truth. These errors are significant in exact change-log contexts.

Thus, a 6.0 reflects that the factual content is mostly present, but the precision, formality, and completeness are lacking.
