The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content for all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 lists the exact sequence for C002; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line. Minor formatting differences (e.g., extra correct explanation in Q1, absence of dashes in Q3) do not introduce errors, extras that are fabricated, or omissions, so no point loss under strict evaluation.
