The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and accuracy: it correctly starts with "No.", identifies the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11), and provides a concise one-paragraph justification that cites lines and case-IDs while proving the claim false. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "happens without any preceding Receive_Order" vs. "never contains *Receive_Order* at all") convey the same precise meaning without errors, and the lack of markdown does not violate the prompt's format requirements.
