The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and concisely identifies both key counterexamples: C003, where Validate_Payment happens before Receive_Order, and C005, where Validate_Payment occurs despite no Receive_Order at all. It correctly cites the pertinent line numbers and case IDs. 

However, the answer could be slightly improved by more explicitly stating the absence of Receive_Order in C005 (the phrase "without any preceding Receive_Order" is good, but "never contains" as in the gold-standard is clearer). Also, it does not mention as strongly as the ground truth that these represent "counter-examples" or directly address the "always" in the claim's wording.

These are mostly minor omissions/slight differences, but per instructions, even minor differences must count. Thus, a deduction is warranted, but the answer still demonstrates a very strong and strictly correct justification.
