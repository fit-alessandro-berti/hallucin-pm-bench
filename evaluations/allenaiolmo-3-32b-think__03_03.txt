**3.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Structural Validity (Major Deduction: -4.0)**: No `<process>` element (BPMN requires it; all elements dumped under `<definitions>` makes invalid XML). No `<?xml>` declaration. Wrong namespace (`20190702` vs. expected `20100524`). Parallel gateways have invalid `type="parallel"` attribute.
- **Hallucinated/Extra Elements (Major Deduction: -2.0)**: Invented second `validate_claim_2` task (prompt specifies one validation with re-validation loop, not separate task). Invalid `<waitEvent>` (non-BPMN element; prompt forbids inventing beyond stated flows).
- **Task Names Not Verbatim (Significant Deduction: -1.0)**: Mismatches include "validate claim" (vs. "**validates the claim**", missing "the"/"s"), "request missing information" (vs. "**requests missing information**"), case errors ("create shipment order" vs. "**Create shipment order**", "schedule courier pickup" vs. "**Schedule courier pickup**").
- **Semantic Flow Errors (Significant Deduction: -1.5)**: No proper loop—re-validation skips completeness gateway (goes directly to warranty gateway, assuming completeness without re-check; ground truth loops correctly via single `validate` task). Extra/missing flows break step 2 logic.
- **Minor Omissions/Mismatches (-0.5)**: No sequence flow IDs/names/labels. Untitled events/gateways (ground truth has descriptive names). Only ~28 lines vs. ground truth's minimal 34 (but bloated with extras).
- **Partial Credits (+1.0 base)**: Correct gateways (2 exclusive, parallel split/join), 2 end events (rejection/success), `wrc_` ID prefix, core parallel tasks/sequence after join, rejection path.

Not semantically equivalent (wrong loop, invalid XML); fails prompt's "model **only** explicitly mentioned" and "verbatim" rules. Unrunnable BPMN tool output.
