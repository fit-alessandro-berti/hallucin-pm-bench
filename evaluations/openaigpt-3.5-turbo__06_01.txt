The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs of parallel tasks from Process B (ignoring Process A as instructed): Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines. The pairs are correctly sorted alphabetically both within each pair (C before Q; P before S) and across the list (C-pair before P-pair). No extra or missing pairs.

The output follows the required one-pair-per-line format precisely, matching the example spacing of two spaces before and after the em dash ("  —  ") consistently for both lines.

The sole differences from the ground truth are minor whitespace variations in the second line (fewer leading spaces before the em dash, resulting in non-aligned dashes) and lack of enclosing markdown code block (```). These are small formatting discrepancies not explicitly mandated by the prompt's format specification, but under utmost strictness for textual differences, they warrant a 0.5-point deduction from perfection. Semantically and functionally, the answer is identical to the ground truth.
