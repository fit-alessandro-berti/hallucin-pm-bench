4.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary (STRICT policy adherence, ~20% weight)**: Perfect. Uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly (capitalization/spacing correct). No forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence"). +2.0 points.
- **Structure & Format (~20% weight)**: Basic table present with correct rows (6 activities), columns (4 roles), primaries mapped accurately to process description. Headers include abbreviations (matches prompt roles list). Markdown valid. However, numbered/bolded activities inconsistent with GT (no numbers; only selective bolding). Blanks in cells instead of full R/A/C/I population. Extra intro sentence, legend, and note (unwarranted content). -1.2 points net.
- **RACI Content Accuracy (~60% weight)**: Major failures vs. GT (utmost strictness applied; cell-by-cell diffs penalized heavily).
  | Activity | Key Diffs (LLM vs. GT) | Penalty |
  |----------|-------------------------|---------|
  | Receive Application | Correct AM **R/A**; misses CO **C**, FC/IT **I** (blanks) | -0.8 |
  | **KYC Review** | CO **R/A** (wrong; GT: CO **R**, AM **A**); misses AM **A**, FC **C**, IT **I** | -1.0 |
  | **Order Vetting** | Correct AM **R/A**; misses CO **C**, FC/IT **I** | -0.8 |
  | Payment Clearance | FC **R/A** (wrong; GT: FC **R**, AM **A**); misses AM **A**, CO **C**, IT **I** | -1.0 |
  | Record Update | Correct IT **R/A**? (wrong; GT: IT **R**, AM **C**); misses AM **C**, CO/FC **I/C**, wrong distributions | -1.0 |
  | Notify Customer | Correct AM **R/A**; misses CO/FC/IT **I** | -0.8 |

  - One **R** per row: Matches (+0.5 partial).
  - AM **A** "where appropriate": Partial (misses non-primary cases like KYC/Payment).
  - Blanks = no C/I: Fails standard RACI completeness (GT fills all 24 cells; LLM ~6 filled). Total cells mismatched: ~80%.
  - No extras (tasks/roles): Good (+0.2).
  - Net: +0.5 - 6.4 = -5.9 points.
- **Overall**: Terms save it from 1.0; primaries partially correct. But incomplete/wrong RACI, extras, formatting diffs = huge gaps. Small errors (e.g., legend, bolding) deduct 0.3 extra. Total: 10 - 5.8 = 4.2.
