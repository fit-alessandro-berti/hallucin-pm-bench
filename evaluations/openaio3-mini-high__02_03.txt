9.5

- The LLM's answer is very concise, accurate, and nearly identical to the ground truth.
- Small deviations:
    - The answer for question 1 omits specifically listing the three case IDs (“C123, C456, C789”), merely stating “3 distinct cases”. While correct in count, missing the explicit enumeration is a minor loss of precision per the strict guidelines.
    - Answer 2 and 3 both correctly match the ground truth.
- Per the instruction to penalize even small deviations, a 0.5 point deduction is justified.
