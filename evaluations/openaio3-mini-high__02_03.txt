The LLM answer is factually correct across all three questions and uses bullet points as required, but loses half a point for slight verbosity in Q2 and Q3 (rephrasing questions instead of minimal responses) and for omitting the explicit case list in Q1 despite the ground truth including it (though not strictly required by the prompt).
