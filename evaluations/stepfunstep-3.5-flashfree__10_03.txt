**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance**: Perfect match for the 4 mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring)—no leaks of disallowed synonyms. (+1.0)
- **Structure**: Markdown table format used correctly; headers match roles. Minor deduction for no bolding on activities/R,A and "-" vs "–". (-0.5)
- **Activities**: Major violations—added 4 unauthorized activities (Approval, Schedule Payment, Notify Analyst) vs ground truth's 2 specific additions (Compliance Officer Approval, Release Funds). "Approval" is renamed/incomplete vs "Compliance Officer Approval". Violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities". Covers extras from narrative but incorrectly. (-3.0)
- **RACI assignments**: Extensive mismatches across nearly all cells (20+ differences out of ~24 comparable):
  | Activity | Key Differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Comp Analyst: I vs C; Treasury: - vs I (+ Officer match) |
  | KYC Review | Officer: - vs C; Treasury: - vs I; Front match |
  | AML Screening | Officer: - vs C; Treasury: - vs I |
  | Risk Scoring | Front: - vs C; Comp Analyst: R,A vs R; Officer: I vs A |
  | Approval/etc. | Extra rows; partial overlap on Officer R,A but Front/Treasury wrong; no "Compliance Officer Approval"; extras like Schedule Payment/Notify not in ground truth |
  | Release Funds | All others -: misses Front I, Comp C, Officer C |
- **Overall fidelity**: ~20% cell-level accuracy; ignores narrative nuances (e.g., escalation only for high-risk, originating analyst notifications, consultations). Significant errors in every row warrant severe penalty. Total reflects partial vocab/structural credit amid wholesale content failure.
