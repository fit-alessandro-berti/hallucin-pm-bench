The LLM answer accurately identifies that the average cycle time cannot be derived due to the absence of timestamps or elapsed-time data, directly aligning with the system's instruction to state when a value cannot be supported by the data. It mirrors the ground truth's core reasoning (insufficient temporal information prevents computation) without introducing errors, fabrications, or extraneous details, while being concise and focused on the requested activity. No meaningful differences exist.
