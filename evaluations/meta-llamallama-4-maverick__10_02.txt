### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Mandated Terms)**: The LLM answer correctly and strictly uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, and “Transaction Analyst” throughout, mapping them to the source text without deviations. This matches the ground truth. No deduction here (+2.0 base).
- **Table Structure and Markdown**: Both use Markdown tables with RACI elements. However, the LLM provides an initial simplified table (mostly R and I, minimal C/A), then an "adjusted" version assuming A (e.g., combining R/A for many tasks), plus unnecessary keys, explanations, and a full rewritten process description. The ground truth is concise: one clean table with full R/A/C/I populated and a brief legend. Extra content in LLM introduces clutter and assumptions, deviating from "create a RACI table... Put the table in Markdown." Significant deduction for extraneous material (-1.5).
- **Roles/Columns**: LLM sticks closely to source roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), avoiding unsubstantiated additions. Ground truth introduces "Operations Manager" (not in source or mandated), using it as a blanket A for most tasks. This is a key mismatch—LLM interprets RACI without fabricating roles, but ground truth alters the role set. Partial credit for fidelity to source, but columns differ (-1.0).
- **Tasks Coverage and Wording**: LLM covers every source step but splits them into 8 granular tasks (e.g., separate "Ensure SWIFT message is sent", "Archive case file", "Notify Regulatory Liaison"), using descriptive phrasing like "Receive and log customer's transfer instruction". Ground truth consolidates into 6 broader tasks (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" omits "log"; "Archive Record" combines archive + notify, omits SWIFT specificity; "**KYC Review**" as standalone without "on sender and beneficiary"). LLM's granularity better "covers every task" without omissions, but wording isn't identical to ground truth's shortened versions, and extra splits create non-matching rows. Strict loss for imperfect alignment (-1.8).
- **RACI Assignments**: Major divergences. LLM's first table is sparse (heavy on R, light on C/A; e.g., KYC: only Regulatory Liaison R). Second table adds assumed A (e.g., Release Payment: Analyst R, implied Liaison A), but still omits C broadly and mismatches specifics (e.g., no broad I/C for Analyst/IT like ground truth's Receive: Analyst R, Liaison I, Manager A, IT C). Ground truth fully populates all R/A/C/I per task with logical (if assumptive) distributions. Assignments align in only ~30% of cases (e.g., partial overlap on core R for screening/KYC/release). Strict penalty for incomplete/inaccurate mappings (-2.5).
- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness**: The LLM answer is a reasonable but verbose interpretation, correctly using mandates and source roles/tasks, but fails to match the ground truth's exact structure, task phrasing, role additions, and balanced RACI fills. Small errors (e.g., splitting notify as separate R/I, sparse C) compound to show ~60% similarity. No criminal/jailbreak issues. Total: Start at 10.0, deduct for cumulative differences = 4.2.
