4.0

- **Major Issues:**
  - *Missing Role*: The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely, while the ground truth includes it and assigns crucial "Accountable" functions to it in every process step.
  - *Accountabilities*: The LLM answer almost always conflates "Responsible" and "Accountable", rather than distributing distinct "Accountable" assignments as shown in the ground truth. When it does list "A", it often assigns it to the same actor handling the task, never introducing a distinct accountable party.
  - *Consulted/Informed*: The LLM answer rarely uses "Consulted" or "Informed", failing to mark important real-world process relationships (e.g., the Regulatory Liaison is "Informed" on final archiving, Transaction Analyst is often "Consulted" or "Informed" on actions they're not responsible for, etc.)
  - *Task Names*: Task descriptions do not always mirror the ground truth's mandated vocabulary (e.g. "KYC Review" is correct, but others like "Receive and log customer's transfer instruction" are not aligned with expected concise process terms like "Receive Payment Instruction").
  - *Sanctions Task*: "Screen payment against sanctions list" is not mapped exactly as "Screen Against Sanctions List" per the specific language in the ground truth.

- **Vocabulary Mandate**: The LLM output does use the mandated synonyms and avoids forbidden terms, which is why it is above 1.0.
- **Step Coverage**: All basic process steps are presentâ€”but lack proper relational mapping and RACI fidelity.
- **Formatting**: Markdown table structure is acceptable, but the content mapping is insufficient.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer covers primary process steps using mandated terms, but it fails strictly on (1) role inclusion/omission (no Operations Manager), (2) proper RACI distribution (particularly for Accountable and Consulted), and (3) exact process term alignment. Even minor differences were to cost significant points, but these are fundamental structural gaps. Thus, 4.0 is a strict but fair score.
