The LLM answer is semantically accurate and correctly identifies the impossibility due to missing data in Artefact A, precisely citing the absence of timestamps and rows needed for "Approve Invoice" durations, std dev, and CI. It adheres to the "one short paragraph" instruction and avoids guessing. Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary reference to Artefact B (not in ground truth, slightly dilutes focus on log); (2) phrasing like "header structure with no data" vs. ground truth's exact "column headers; all event rows and every timestamp... redacted"; (3) lacking ground truth's specificity on "concrete times for any 'Approve Invoice' execution" and "additional raw log entries required"; (4) less punchy opener ("It is not possible" vs. "Impossible"). These are small stylistic/precision differences under utmost strictness.
