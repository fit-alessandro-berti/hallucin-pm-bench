7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Factual Accuracy (Strong, but incomplete detail)**: The LLM correctly identifies the added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway change (`gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). No extraneous or speculative items are included, aligning with the prompt's restriction to only listed categories. However, it uses only task IDs instead of the full names from the XML `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" vs. just `check_vip`), which the ground truth includes for clarity and fidelity to the XML structure. This omission of names is a notable error under strict scrutiny, as the prompt specifies using "element names exactly as they appear," and names are explicit in the XML. The gateway description is factually right but lacks the versioning detail ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), making it less precise.
  
- **Structure and Formatting (Partial match, with deviations)**: Headings match the required text ("Added tasks", etc.) but lack the bolding and exact bullet-style presentation in the ground truth (e.g., **Added tasks** with * sub-bullets). Lists use `-` instead of `*`, and there's no final note "(No other differences should be reported.)". The prompt specifies "exact headings" with bullets (•), which the LLM approximates but does not replicate precisely. No "(none)" is needed here, so that's fine.

- **Overall Strictness Penalty**: Core facts are captured without speculation, earning a solid base score, but small-to-medium errors (missing names, incomplete gateway phrasing, formatting mismatches) warrant a deduction of 2.5 points. This reflects significant loss for not fully mirroring the ground truth's detail and presentation, as even minor deviations in XML fidelity and structure reduce completeness. A perfect 10.0 would require near-identical replication.
