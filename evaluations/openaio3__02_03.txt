• The LLM answer matches the ground-truth in all substantive respects:  
  - The count and identities of cases are correct.
  - The predecessor activity is correct.
  - The activity appearing once is correct.
• However, the format is not strictly as "concise, bullet-point answers only"—the LLM answer uses slightly more elaborate language in the first bullet ("Distinct cases: **3** (C123, C456, C789)" instead of just "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)").  
• The ground truth is more concise and strictly follows the instructions.  
• This minor verbosity is a small deviation but must result in a deduction under the "utmost strictness" criterion.

**Reasoning**: Nearly perfect on content, but very slight deduction for not being maximally terse as explicitly requested.

**Score: 9.7**
