The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a single-paragraph justification citing the exact same counter-examples (C003 with lines 6-7 showing Validate_Payment before Receive_Order, and C005 with line 11 lacking any Receive_Order, referencing lines 11-12). It adheres closely to the prompt's structure, with accurate line and case citations. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., including precise timestamps not in the ground truth, and "with no Receive_Order activity present" vs. "never contains *Receive_Order* at all"), lack of bullet formatting, and absence of a concluding explanatory sentence, but these do not alter the factual accuracy or core reasoning.
