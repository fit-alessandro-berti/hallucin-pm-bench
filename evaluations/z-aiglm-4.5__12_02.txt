The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides evidence with line numbers and case-ids. It cites that in C003, *Validate_Payment* occurs before *Receive_Order* (lines 6 and 7), and that C005 contains *Validate_Payment* without any *Receive_Order* (lines 11 and 12). However, it makes a very minor omission by not explicitly stating that these cases prove that *Validate_Payment* does **not always** follow *Receive_Order*, as done in the ground-truth answer. The justification is succinct and precise but could be strengthened by a slightly clearer statement that these instances *contradict* the claimed invariant, not just that they are observed. This minor lack of explicit contradiction-wording and the slightly terser explanation justifies a deduction of 1.5 points, but the core information and correct citations are provided.
