6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies the core changes—three added tasks (by ID), one removed task (by ID), and the gateway type change (Exclusive to Inclusive). Headings match exactly, and no extraneous or incorrect changes are mentioned, aligning with the prompt's focus on structural changes only.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: 
  - **Detail omission**: Added and removed tasks list only IDs, omitting descriptive names (e.g., "Verify Identity" for Task_VerifyIdentity), which are essential for a complete summary of "every change." Ground truth includes both for clarity and accuracy, making the LLM answer less informative.
  - **Gateway specificity**: The response is vague ("Exclusive → Inclusive") compared to ground truth's detailed explanation (gateway ID, XOR/OR terminology, version context). This misses nuance in a process-mining context.
  - **Format differences**: Uses unnumbered bullets instead of numbered lists; lacks bolding/emphasis on names, parenthetical IDs, and the closing note confirming no other changes. These are small but compound errors under "utmost strictness," reducing completeness.
- **Overall**: Accurate on what changed but incomplete and less precise, warranting a mid-range score with deductions for missing elements that affect summary quality.
