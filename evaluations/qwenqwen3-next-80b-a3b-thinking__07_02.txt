9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and covers all required points, but a couple of small issues warrant a deduction for utmost strictness:

1. **Added tasks**: The answer gives only the ID (e.g., Task_RequestDocs) instead of the required “name (ID)” format as in the ground truth (e.g., **Request Additional Documents** (`Task_RequestDocs`)). Since the prompt requests summary and IDs, this omission counts as a detail error.
   
2. **Removed tasks**: Similarly, only the ID is provided, not the name + ID.

3. **Gateway-type changes**: The answer is concise (“Exclusive → Inclusive”), but doesn’t specify the gateway ID as in the ground truth. This is minor but counts as a loss of detail.

4. The heading format lacks bolding and literal reproduction of the heading phrases, but this is quite minor.

**No factual errors or missing changes are present.** If only the content were considered, this would approach 10, but in accordance with maximum stringency and the loss of identifying detail, a deduction of one full point is warranted.

**Final grade: 9.0**
