7.5

### Explanation of Score
- **Question 1 (Perfect match, no deduction)**: The LLM correctly identifies exactly 1 occurrence of “Manual Fraud Check,” aligning precisely with the ground truth (1 time, in case 1002). No speculation or error here.
- **Question 2 (Partial match, 5/10 deduction impact)**: The LLM provides a concise (98 words), logical explanation focused on the snippet's small size (14 events, 3 cases, ~2 hours), temporal limitations, and risks of extrapolation (e.g., clustering, process changes), which captures the core idea of sampling bias well. However, it diverges significantly from the ground truth by omitting key elements: (1) quantitative illustration of error (e.g., frequency swinging 0%–7% with tiny changes, wide confidence intervals); (2) sampling error for rare events; and (3) critical nuance on near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check,” “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) and strict vs. fuzzy string matching, which could distort estimates. The LLM introduces mild speculation (e.g., triggers by loan types/regions/shifts, automation "later in the month") despite the system prompt against it, further reducing fidelity. These omissions and additions create substantive differences, warranting a strict penalty under the evaluation criteria. Overall, the response is helpful and on-topic but not a close replica.
