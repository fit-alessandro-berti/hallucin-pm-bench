9.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, accurately identifying both sets of concurrently executable tasks in the correct order, and with no extraneous information about Processes A or C as instructed.

**Minor issues resulting in a point deduction:**
- The LLM omits explicit labeling of the sets with terms like "Set 1" and "Set 2" or mentioning which parallel block each set refers to. The ground truth includes these contextual labels.
- The answer could be even clearer by marking that these refer specifically to the first and second parallel constructs, as the ground truth does.

Otherwise, the content and sequence are perfectly correct. Hence, the answer receives a 9.0.
