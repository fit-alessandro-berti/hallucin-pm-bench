8.0

The LLM answer is factually correct in substance and direction, identifying both added and removed tasks and the gateway type change, with element names matching the XML. However, it does not strictly follow the required answer format:

- Category headings are not verbatim as instructed (e.g., "â€¢ Added tasks" instead of "**Added tasks**").
- The element names and descriptions are sometimes merged or not formatted as in the ground truth, e.g. not explicitly specifying both name and id in parentheses (only the label and id together or alone); in the added/removed tasks section, it uses only one of them or mixes them in a non-standard way.
- For gateway type changes, the presentation is less formal than the ground truth.

Per your guidance to penalize even small format/precision errors, this warrants a significant deduction, but the core factual accuracy remains. Therefore, score is 8.0.
