**1.2**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a near-minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Timer placement/type**: Intermediate catch event after Task_Check (delays process unnecessarily) vs. interrupting boundary timer *on* Task_Receive.
- **Flows modified/added**: Replaces f3 with f3a/f3b, adds invalid "default flow" from timer vs. new flow *from* Timer_48h *to* Task_Triage (no f3 changes).
- **Escalation outcome**: New End_Escalated (ends process, skips Triage) vs. direct to *existing* Task_Triage (ensures SLA compliance by reaching Triage).
- **BPMN validity**: Misuses intermediate catch timer (forces 48h wait post-Check; no "expiry branch" via default flow) vs. correct interrupting boundary semantics.
- **New elements**: Adds new end event vs. none (reuses all except one timer/flow).
- **Logic/SLA fit**: Fails to enforce reaching Triage ≤48h from submission; adds delay vs. bypass to Triage.
- **Conciseness**: ~140 words vs. ground truth's tighter format.

Minor matches (PT48H, Timer_48h ID, no new tasks) insufficient to offset errors.
