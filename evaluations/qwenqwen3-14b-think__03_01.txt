3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer attempts a BPMN 2.0 XML structure but contains critical structural and fidelity errors when strictly compared to the ground truth and prompt requirements. I evaluated line-by-line for exactness, validity, and adherence, penalizing even minor deviations heavily as instructed. Key issues:

- **Major Structural Errors (Severe Deduction: -4.0 base from 10)**:
  - No sequence flow from `t2` ("Provide Reset Instructions") to `t6` ("Confirm with Customer"). This disconnects the "Password Reset" path entirely, violating the description (lines 3, 7) where it must lead to confirmation/closure. In ground truth, this is `f5` (t2 → t6). The process is invalid BPMN as `t2` is unreachable in execution.
  - Exclusive gateway `gw2` has unconditional outgoing flows (`f6` to `t4`, `f7` to `t5`), making it non-functional for decision logic (description line 5: "either Resolve Issue or Forward to Specialist"). Ground truth uses explicit conditions ("yes"/"no"). This renders the diagnosis branch broken.

- **Fidelity to Description and Ground Truth (Deduction: -1.5)**:
  - Task names differ: "Classify Ticket" vs. ground truth "Auto-Classification" (line 2: "automatically classified"). Minor but strict per instructions.
  - Missing names on gateways (`gw1`, `gw2`, `gw3`) and events (`start1`, `end1`), while ground truth includes descriptive ones (e.g., "Password Reset?", "Customer Confirms?") aligned with decisions.
  - Start event unnamed vs. "Ticket Submitted" (line 1); end unnamed vs. "Ticket Closed" (line 10).
  - Conditions syntax differs: LLM uses executable-style `##{ticketType == 'Password Reset'}` and `#{confirmed}` (not in ground truth's simple `<conditionExpression>` with "yes"/"no"). Ground truth avoids process variables, matching non-executable intent.
  - Re-work loop (line 9) is partially correct (`f12`: gw3 → t3 on `!confirmed`), but ineffective due to upstream issues.

- **XML and Format Deviations (Deduction: -0.5)**:
  - Unnecessary `xmlns` for diagram elements (`bpmndi`, `di`, `dc`), violating "no diagram/interchange" instruction, even if unused.
  - `isExecutable="true"` vs. ground truth "false"; process ID "SupportTicketProcess" vs. "support_ticket" with name "Support-Ticket".
  - No `targetNamespace` or XML declaration, minor mismatch to ground truth.
  - Line count: LLM ~25 lines (concise, compliant), but errors outweigh this.
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no added timers/escalations), earning partial credit for restraint.

The loop and basic skeleton (e.g., flows from diagnosis/specialist to resolve/confirm) show partial understanding (+1.5 credit), but the broken paths make it non-equivalent to ground truth. Total: 3.5/10—functional but flawed, far from "exact" translation.
