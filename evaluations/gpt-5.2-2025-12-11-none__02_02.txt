**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect and precisely matches the ground truth in all content:
- Q1/A1: Correct count (3); listing cases is accurate supplementary detail, not erroneous.
- Q2/A2: Exact sequence match, including order and activities (no escapes needed as per log format).
- Q3/A3: Exact distinct activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), alphabetically ordered, one per line as prompted (bullets in ground truth are stylistic, not required).

No errors, hallucinations, extras that fabricate/mislead, or omissions. Minor formatting differences (bolding, headers) do not impact factual precision.
