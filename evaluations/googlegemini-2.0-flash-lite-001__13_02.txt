9.2

1. The answer for the count of "Manual_Fraud_Check" (1) is correct (matches ground truth).
2. The calculations for (a) events (1/48 = 2.08%) and (b) cases (1/12 = 8.33%) are correct with correct rounding and percentages.
3. The explanation for question 3 covers:
   - The rarity of the event (single occurrence);
   - Cautions about minimal impact and risk of generalising;
   - Notes on misleading analysis and lack of generalisability.
   However, it is slightly weaker than the ground truth on specific terminology (e.g., variance/instability, cycle time, resource load, confidence intervals), and could better highlight how a single occurrence increases noise/variance and the instability of conclusions. There's also a redundant hypothetical about "if the dataset was larger," which could be phrased tighter.

Given the requirements for strictness and significant point loss for even small errors, the numeric answers are perfect (no deduction), but the explanation could benefit from more technical precisionâ€”thus, a deduction of 0.8.

**Final score: 9.2**
