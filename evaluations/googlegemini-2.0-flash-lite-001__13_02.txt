The LLM answer is accurate and complete for questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth exactly on counts and percentages (minor formatting differences like spacing before % are negligible). For question 3, it adheres to the word limit, mentions the single occurrence (i), cautions against over-generalization (iii) by highlighting risks in model building and snapshot limitations, but only weakly addresses variance/instability (ii)â€”focusing on minimal impact rather than explicit issues like noise, skewed metrics (e.g., cycle times), or wide confidence intervals. Strict evaluation deducts for this shortfall in depth on statistical unreliability.
