9.5

The LLM answer is factually perfect: correctly identifies "No" compliance, accurately assesses all four rules (with explicit checks for "once each" in Rule 1, proper sequencing, and the sole Rule 3 violation due to NA before RA), and provides a concise summary. No errors in logic, references, or reasoning—all match the ground truth exactly.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic differences under utmost strictness:
- Bullet list vs. ground truth's table format (less structured visually, no ✔/❌ symbols).
- Opening "**No**" is direct per prompt, but ground truth expands to "**No – the trace is not compliant.**" with a "**Justification**" header and table.
- Trivial wording variances (e.g., "breached" vs. "violated"; "is executed before ... is completed" vs. "occurs before ... is completed").

These are non-substantive but count as small differences per evaluation criteria.
