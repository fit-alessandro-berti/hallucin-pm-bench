1. The LLM answer correctly states that “Manual_Fraud_Check” appears 1 time.  
2. The answer computes the percentage as 5.56%, with the correct calculation.  
3. Correctly identifies that only case A1002 contains the activity.  
4. The two sampling-related reasons provided are valid: (a) very limited time window and sample size, and (b) selection/temporal bias from a single date and few cases. Both correspond closely to the ground truth’s approved reasoning.

Minor deduction:
- In 4a (“very limited time window and sample size”) the LLM notes “the fragment covers just one day (18 events)”, but the dataset timestamps confirm this is a partial day (“morning of 1 May 2025”), so stating “just one day” is a slight overreach: strictly, it’s not necessarily a full day. Similarly, “selection/temporal bias” could be expanded to mention lack of case-mix or survivorship/truncation bias, but it’s not wrong. 
- The answers are otherwise precise and closely adhere to the facts in the logs, with no invented data.

Given the instruction for utmost strictness and penalty for minor errors, a small deduction is warranted for the “just one day” overstatement in reason 4a.

Final score: 9.0
