### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Format Compliance**: The LLM answer follows the prompt's specified structure (per-rule status with bolded terms and ≤20-word justifications, followed by all-caps overall result) more closely than the ground truth's table format. No deduction here, but strict adherence doesn't compensate for content errors.
- **R1**: Exact match in status and justification intent (both confirm approvals for high amount). Full credit.
- **R2**: Major error—status incorrectly "Compliant" (should be "Violated"); justification ignores Change_Request's impact on "last required approval" (new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07 makes Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 non-compliant, as it's neither after nor within 2 days). Significant deduction (this alone warrants ~50% point loss due to misunderstanding rule interaction).
- **R3**: Status matches ("Violated"); justification correctly identifies temporal precedence via events/dates (Pay_Invoice 2025-03-06 before Receive_Goods 2025-03-07), despite trace's non-chronological listing. Minor phrasing difference, but strictness deducts slightly for not specifying exact dates as in ground truth.
- **R4**: Exact match in status and justification (hazardous=false). Full credit.
- **R5**: Status matches ("Violated"); justification notes Change_Request after approvals and Ship_Goods before new approval, but omits Pay_Invoice (which also violates "before any further processing step"). Incomplete coverage deducts moderately.
- **R6**: Exact match in status and justification. Full credit.
- **Overall Result**: Matches "NON-COMPLIANT", but ground truth specifies violating rules (R2, R3, R5); LLM implies via listings but doesn't list them explicitly—minor deduction for less precision.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Even small omissions (e.g., R5, date specifics in R3) incur significant loss; the R2 error is a critical misinterpretation, preventing a passing score above mid-range. Total differences: 2 full mismatches/partials across 6 rules + minor format/precision gaps = low score.
