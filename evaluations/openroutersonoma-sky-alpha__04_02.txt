7.0

Rationale for Scoring:
- R1: **Correct**. Justification aligns with the facts.
- R2: **Incorrect**. The LLM incorrectly states "Compliant," missing that after the Change_Request, a new Manager_Approval is required before further processing, so Ship_Goods should be within 2 days after the *latest* required approval (which was on 07-Mar, but Ship_Goods happened on 05-Mar—thus, a violation). Clear, critical error.
- R3: **Correct**. Clearly identifies the violation.
- R4: **Correct**. Correctly marked not applicable.
- R5: **Correct**. Violation and justification are fully in line with ground truth.
- R6: **Correct**. Justification and finding match.
- Overall: The final compliance determination ("NON-COMPLIANT") is correct, which demonstrates general understanding, but the significant misassessment of R2 is a major flaw.

Per instructions ("small errors should reflect in significant loss of points"), the wrong assessment of R2—a direct contradiction to the ground truth—warrants a heavy penalty, though the rest is handled accurately and concisely in the required format. Thus, 7.0 reflects a clear but not catastrophic error.
