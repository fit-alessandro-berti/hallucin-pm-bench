**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, structure of reasoning, cited evidence (exact same CaseIDs C001–C004, same intervening activities "Pack_Items" in C002 and "Check_Fraud" in C004, same compliance in C001/C003), and conclusion. It correctly interprets "immediately after... with no other activities in between" as requiring no interveners, cites precise sequences with timestamps (bonus precision matching log order), and adheres strictly to the task (Yes/No + justification via CaseIDs/sequences). Stylistic differences (text lists vs. table) are irrelevant as the task specifies no format; zero errors or deviations warrant full marks under strict evaluation.
