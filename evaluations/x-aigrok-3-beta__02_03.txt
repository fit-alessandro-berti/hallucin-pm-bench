- **Evaluation Notes**: The LLM answer is factually correct across all three questions, matching the ground truth content precisely (3 cases with identifiers, "Pack_Items" as predecessor for C456's Ship_Order, and "Cancel_Order" as the unique activity). However, it loses a full point due to minor deviations in conciseness and structure: (1) Restates questions in Q2 and Q3 instead of providing terse direct answers like the ground truth's "Pack\_Items" and "Cancel\_Order"; (2) Uses plain bullet points without the ground truth's labeled (* **A1:** etc.) format, slightly reducing adherence to the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction despite overall brevity. No factual or major errors, but strict criteria penalize these small presentation differences.
