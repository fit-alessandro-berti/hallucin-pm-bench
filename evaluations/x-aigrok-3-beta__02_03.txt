9.5

- The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth:  
    - The count of distinct cases is correct.
    - The activity immediately preceding “Ship_Order” for C456 is correctly identified as “Pack_Items”.
    - The activity appearing exactly once, “Cancel_Order”, is also identified correctly.
- The only (very minor) deviations are:
    - The ground truth explicitly numbers each item (A1, A2, A3) where the LLM answer uses unnumbered bullet points.
    - The LLM answer adds slight rewording (e.g., “There are 3 distinct cases: ...” instead of strictly “3 cases (C123, C456, C789)”).
- Although these are only presentational and not substantial differences, per the instruction to deduct even for small errors, a loss of 0.5 points is appropriate.
