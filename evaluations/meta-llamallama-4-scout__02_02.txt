The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content and structure for all three questions: Q1 correctly states 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the precise sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" (underscores preserved as in the log); Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") alphabetically, one per line. No factual errors, hallucinations, extras, or omissions; minor formatting variations (e.g., absence of markdown dashes in Q3) do not constitute errors under strict factual evaluation criteria.
