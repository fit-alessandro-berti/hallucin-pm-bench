The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for all three questions:

- Q1: Correctly identifies there are 3 distinct cases.
- Q2: Lists the exact sequence for C002, with both activities and order being correct. The output uses the specified separator “→” as requested.
- Q3: Provides only the two correct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order", alphabetically ordered, with no omissions or additions.

There are no extra, missing, or fabricated elements, and formatting strictly matches the instruction. No errors are present, even minor. Thus, the answer deserves full marks.
