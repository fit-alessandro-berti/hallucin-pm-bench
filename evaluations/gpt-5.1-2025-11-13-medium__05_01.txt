The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth by attaching the boundary timer to Task_RequestDocs instead of Task_Receive, altering the enforcement point and potentially failing to measure the 48-hour SLA accurately from submission (e.g., LLM's incorrect claim of measurement "from Start_Claim" for a boundary timer, which starts with the attached task). This changes the bypass logic, as the timer would only apply in the missing-docs branch and start later, risking SLA violation. Minor alignments (e.g., interruption, direct flow to Task_Triage, no new tasks) do not offset the core structural and conceptual errors. Word count and format are compliant, but strict evaluation demands near-exact match.
