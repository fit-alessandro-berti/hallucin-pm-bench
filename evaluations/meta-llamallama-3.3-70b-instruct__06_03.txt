The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two concurrent task sets in the exact order they appear, matching the core content of the ground truth without referencing Processes A or C. However, it deducts points for minor but noticeable differences under strict evaluation: (1) unnecessary introductory phrasing not present in the ground truth; (2) added explanatory parentheticals referencing "Parallel Split #1/#2" that provide extra procedural details beyond a simple list of tasks; (3) use of "and" instead of the ground truth's parallel symbol (‖) for denoting concurrency; (4) lack of bolded headers like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**" and code-style backticks around task names; and (5) omission of the ground truth's closing statement affirming no other parallel tasks. These formatting and extraneous details deviations, while not altering the factual accuracy, warrant a significant deduction for not precisely mirroring the ground truth's concise, structured presentation.
