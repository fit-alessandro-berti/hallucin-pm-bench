9.5

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth answer: it lists the two sets of concurrently executable tasks, correctly naming all four tasks and enumerating the sets in the correct order. The only (minor) deviations are:

- The ground truth labels the sets with more explicit block names (“first parallel block”, “second parallel block”), whereas the LLM answer refers to splits (“after Parallel Split #1”), which is a stylistic rather than content difference.
- The ground truth explicitly notes “No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel.” The LLM answer omits this clarifying sentence, which does add a tiny bit of completeness.

However, the sets and the interpretation of the parallel constructs are both correct. The differences are minimal, but according to the instruction, even small omissions should reflect in some points lost. Thus, 9.5 is warranted.
