5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part (a) Accuracy (Decision Points):** The LLM correctly identifies the two key decision points and provides rules that are substantively accurate, closely aligning with the ground truth descriptions. Minor wording differences (e.g., "skip" vs. "bypass... otherwise proceeds"; "approvals are obtained" vs. "record 'Approve'") introduce small imprecisions under strict evaluation, warranting a deduction. Score: 8.5/10.
- **Part (b) Accuracy (Documents List):** Major omissions—the three scorecards (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow) are explicitly required as inputs in Step 3 and must appear in first-appearance order before the Deck Memo, but they are entirely absent from the LLM's list. This results in an incomplete list (6 items vs. ground truth's 9), disrupting the order and failing to capture all required documents. The inclusion of explanatory notes is extraneous and does not compensate. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), but the core errors are severe. Score: 1.5/10.
- **Overall Structure and Fidelity:** Clear formatting matches the ground truth style, but the critical flaws in part (b) dominate. The response is responsive but not exhaustive or precise enough under utmost strictness. Total weighted score: 5.0/10 (averaged, with heavier penalty for incompleteness in document enumeration).
