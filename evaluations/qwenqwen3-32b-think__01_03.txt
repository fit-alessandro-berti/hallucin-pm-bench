5.5

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM answer correctly identifies both decision points:
  - The risk-based branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check (step 4).
  - The TriVote multi-approver gate (step 6).
- The wording in both cases is accurate and precise, matching the intent of the process.
- However, there is some minor loss in precision:
  - For TriVote, the LLM says “the gate passes if at least two out of three required approvals...are obtained.” This is clear, but the original process states that approvals must come specifically from named roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer). The LLM does state the roles, so this is not a significant fault.

**b) Required Documents**

- Significant errors are present here:
  - The LLM omits the three **scorecards** (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) that are required as explicit inputs to the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (step 3), which appear in the ground truth as documents 2-4.
  - All other required documents are correctly listed and in proper order.
  - The LLM treats "Signed Offer Sheet 77" and "Offer Sheet 77" as two separate documents, which matches the process intent.

**Extra scrutiny:**
- The LLM does not hallucinate any non-existent documents.
- The LLM explains document context but is slightly verbose.

**Point deductions:**
- Omission of three required documents (scorecards) is a major factual error.
- Wording in decision point summaries is sound, but not significantly more precise than the ground truth.
- Minor issues in phrasing and excessive commentary, but these are less important than the document omission.

**Final Assessment:**
- Major point loss for failing to list all required documents (scorecards), as explicitly required.
- Correct and concise decision point summaries.

**Score: 5.5**
