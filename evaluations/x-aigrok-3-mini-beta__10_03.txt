4.0

### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer correctly uses the four authorized activity terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without any synonym leaks, which is a strong point. However, under strict evaluation criteria, it incurs severe penalties for multiple violations:

- **Addition of unauthorized activities**: The prompt explicitly instructs "do not ... add activities," yet the LLM introduces four new ones ("Escalation for Approval," "Schedule Payment," "Notify Originating Analyst," and a partial mismatch in "Release Funds" handling). The ground truth limits to six activities (the four core plus "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"), interpreting the narrative without expansion. This alone warrants a major deduction (e.g., -3.0 points).

- **Incomplete or incorrect RACI assignments**: Significant deviations from the ground truth across all activities:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Misses "C" for Compliance Analyst (-0.5).
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: Misses "C" for Compliance Officer and "I" for Treasury Ops (-1.0 each).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Incorrectly assigns "A" to Compliance Analyst (should be Compliance Officer); misses "C" for Front-Office Analyst (-1.5).
  - **Compliance Officer Approval** (implied in LLM as "Escalation for Approval"): Wrong assignments (e.g., Compliance Analyst as "R" instead of "C"; Front-Office as "I" correct, but Officer only "A" not "R,A"; added Treasury "I" not in ground truth) (-1.5).
  - **Release Funds**: Misses "C" for Compliance Analyst and Officer; incorrectly assigns "A" to Officer (should be Treasury "R,A" with others "C" or "I") (-1.0).
  - Extraneous activities like "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst" are not in ground truth and misalign with the narrative (e.g., notification is implied in "Release Funds" without separate RACI) (-1.5).

- **Formatting and minor issues**: Uses blank cells instead of dashes (â€“) for no involvement, as in ground truth (-0.2). No bolding for emphasis on R/A, though not strictly required (-0.1). Table structure is otherwise clean.

These errors (structural additions, ~70% mismatch in assignments, omissions) result in low fidelity to the ground truth and prompt constraints, justifying a score well below passing despite partial correctness on core vocabulary and some basic R/A roles. Total deductions accumulate to limit the score to 4.0, reflecting strictness for even small inaccuracies.
