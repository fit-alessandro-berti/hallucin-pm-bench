The LLM answer correctly identifies that the fact is inaccurate and accurately cites Case 1001 as an example where the order is reversed. However, the justification is incomplete when compared to the ground truth:

- It does **not** mention Case 1002, where `Update_Inventory` is entirely absentâ€”an important point, since the "always" claim is falsified by any counterexample.
- It does **not** mention Case 1003, where the order is also reversed.
- It only cites one relevant case, not all available evidence, and does not make clear that "immediately before" *never* happens in the data fragment provided.

Due to this lack of full coverage and specificity, especially regarding Cases 1002 and 1003, and not fully addressing the "always" aspect, significant points must be deducted for completeness and strict evidence-based reasoning. However, the basic verdict and the supporting logic for the one case it cites are correct.
