The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate/not accurate), coverage of all cases, correct sequences/orders/absence noted, and proper disproof of "always" via counterexamples. Justification cites case IDs and activities as required (sequences explicitly list relevant activities). Minor deductions for: (1) lacking line citations (GT specifies lines 3-4, 11-14 for precision, enhancing verifiability); (2) not explicitly referencing "immediately" in counters/conclusion despite it being in the claim (GT does: "immediately precede"); (3) slightly less structured format (no "Short verdict"/bullets, full sequences mildly verbose vs. GT's concise bullets). No factual errors or guesses; strictly data-based.
