7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a precise counterexample from case C003 (lines 6-7), accurately disproving the "always follows" claim with proper citations. However, under strict evaluation, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it omits the second clear counterexample in case C005 (line 11, Validate_Payment without any prior Receive_Order), which the ground truth explicitly includes as part of proving the claim false. Additionally, minor phrasing deviations (e.g., embedding "No" into a full sentence with "the fact is not accurate because" instead of standalone "No" followed by justification) violate the prompt's exact format instruction ("Answer **“Yes” or “No” only**, then justify"), warranting further deduction despite overall factual accuracy.
