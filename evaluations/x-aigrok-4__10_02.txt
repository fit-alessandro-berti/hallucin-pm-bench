2.5

### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Structural and Formatting Differences (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The LLM answer uses a simplified Markdown table with only three role columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting the "Operations Manager" column present in the ground truth. It lacks the precise header "Task / Activity (mandated wording)", bolding for "**KYC Review**", and the explanatory legend at the bottom. Task descriptions in the LLM are verbose and directly copied from the informal text (e.g., full phrasing for Task 1 and 5), rather than the concise, rephrased versions in the ground truth (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction"). Task 5 in the LLM incorrectly combines "release the payment" and "ensure the SWIFT message is sent" into one row, while the ground truth separates concerns and omits explicit SWIFT handling. No coverage of notifications in a distinct way matching ground truth.

- **Vocabulary and Mandate Compliance (Partial Credit, but Inconsistent: -1.5 points)**: Correctly uses "KYC Review" in Task 3 and mandated roles ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison"). However, it does not strictly enforce "mandated wording" across all tasks (e.g., no bolding or explicit labeling as required). IT Support is retained appropriately, but the addition of unnecessary combinations deviates from "only the mandated terms."

- **RACI Assignments (Fundamental Errors: -2.0 points)**: Assignments diverge significantly from the ground truth across all tasks. For example:
  - Task 1 (Receive): LLM assigns "AR" to Transaction Analyst (invalid combined notation; implies dual role without clarity), with no involvement for others; ground truth has R (Analyst), I (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), C (IT Support).
  - Task 2 (Screen): Partial match (R for Analyst, A for Liaison), but omits I (Operations Manager) and C (IT Support).
  - Task 3 (KYC Review): LLM assigns "AR" to Regulatory Liaison only; ground truth has C (Analyst), R (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), I (IT Support).
  - Task 4 (Approve): LLM has I (Analyst) and "AR" (Liaison); ground truth has C (Analyst), R (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), I (IT Support).
  - Task 5 (Release): LLM assigns R (Analyst), A (Liaison), R (IT Support), but ground truth has R (Analyst), I (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), C (IT Support), and does not include SWIFT.
  - Task 6 (Archive): LLM has I (Liaison) and "AR" (IT Support); ground truth has C (Analyst), I (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), R (IT Support). The use of "AR" (or implied combinations) in multiple cells is non-standard RACI notation, violating clarity and the ground truth's single-letter-per-cell format.

- **Coverage of Source Text (Incomplete Alignment: -0.5 points)**: The LLM covers all six steps from the informal description, including SWIFT sending and notifications, but this leads to mismatches with the ground truth's streamlined six tasks (which consolidate and omit some details like SWIFT). No omissions, but the mapping is not faithful to the ground truth's interpretation.

Overall, the LLM answer shows basic awareness of the task (e.g., Markdown table, some mandated terms) but fails on accuracy, completeness, and strict adherence, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Small issues like "AR" notation alone would deduct points; combined with structural and assignment errors, it severely underperforms.
