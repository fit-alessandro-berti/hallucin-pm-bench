5.5

**Justification:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer uses only the mandated role words (“Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “KYC Review”) throughout, as required by the vocabulary mandate.
- The table is formatted in Markdown as instructed.
- All steps from the informal process are accounted for, and the roles included are consistent with the vocabulary directive.

**Serious Issues (major point deductions):**
- **Incomplete Roles:** The LLM answer omits the “Operations Manager” column, despite its central presence and assignment of Accountable (A) status in the ground truth for every activity. This is a serious omission, as Operations Manager is needed for completeness in RACI.
- **Activity Naming:** The task names in the LLM answer are mostly raw sentences from the prompt. The mandate is clear that mandated phrasing/terminology and abstraction of the task names is needed—ground truth tightly maps to “Receive Payment Instruction”, etc., while LLM just pastes the informal text or long-winded paraphrases for step names.
- **Legend Missing:** There is no legend in the LLM answer explaining RACI letters, which is present in the ground truth. While minor, for strictness this is an error.
- **Incorrect RACI Assignments:** For several activities, the LLM answer assigns both A and R to the same person for the same task (e.g., step 1), which is not standard RACI practice. In the ground truth, the Accountable assignment goes to the Operations Manager, never to the same person as Responsible. LLM also sometimes assigns AR to Regulatory Liaison together, which is not correct.
- **Consulted and Informed Underutilized/Inaccurate:** The ground truth has broad use of Consulted and Informed for all stakeholders in each step. The LLM answer leaves entire rows and columns blank, omitting some Consulted and Informed relationships.
- **“Release payment AND ensure the SWIFT message is sent”** is merged; ground truth splits “Release Payment” and “Archive Record” as two activities.

**Other Issues (minor but relevant for strictness):**
- LLM occasionally uses “AR” for a single cell, which isn't standard and wasn’t done in the ground truth (where A and R are different people).
- No bolding or clear highlighting as in the ground truth.

**Summary:**  
While the LLM answer makes a creditable attempt and gets the mandated vocabulary right, the RACI mapping is notably inferior to the ground truth and lacks completeness of accountable roles, abstraction in activity naming, and full allocation of Inform/Consult relationships. These substantial structural and accuracy lapses are significant and warrant a strict penalty.

**Score: 5.5/10**  
- Minus significant points for role and activity omissions, RACI allocation errors, and table clarity/structure.  
- Minus further points for missing Consulted/Informed and legend.  
- Credit retained for mandated vocabulary fidelity and Markdown formatting.
