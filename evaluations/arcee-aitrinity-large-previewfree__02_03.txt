**10.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content (correct counts, activity names, and facts), with equivalent conciseness in bullet-point format. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "distinct cases:" vs. "cases (", full sentence vs. bare name for Q2/Q3) are stylistic, not errors, and align with "concise, bullet-point answers only." No factual discrepancies or small errors present.
