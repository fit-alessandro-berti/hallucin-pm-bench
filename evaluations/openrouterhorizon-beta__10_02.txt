5.5

**Evaluation:**

**Mandated Terms & Fidelity**  
- The LLM answer uses the mandated terms: "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", and "KYC Review" correctly.
- It never uses forbidden terms like “Compliance Officer”, “CDD”, etc.
- Step activities are reworded but maintain process intent.

**Major Errors:**  
- **Omission of “Operations Manager”:** The ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as the Accountable role for every activity. The LLM output omits this role completely, assigning "Accountable" almost always to the same Responsible party (often a best-practice violation in RACI and not matching the brief).
- **Some redundant tasks:** The splitting of steps (5a, 5b, 6a, 6b) is somewhat unnecessarily granular, diverging from the ground truth, which is tighter and clearer.
- **Consulted and Informed column assignment:** There’s a mismatch and occasional redundancy, e.g., Regulatory Liaison is both Informed and Consulted in archiving, but ground truth marks only specific parties C/I per task. The ground truth is more precise on RACI allocation, such as only IT Support being Responsible for archiving while the LLM answer lists Regulatory Liaison as Consulted and Informed for several tasks without justification.
- **Responsible vs. Accountable**: The LLM assigns both R and A to the same party in multiple tasks ("Transaction Analyst" or "Regulatory Liaison" often R/A for the same row), not following the RACI principle (and not matching the source table).

**Minor Errors:**  
- Activities are more wordy and not always strictly in the mandated vocabulary style (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" rather than just "**KYC Review**") – not maximal but not strictly as concise as the ground truth.

**Strengths:**  
- Proper Markdown table.
- Activities mapped to mandated role terms.
- Attempts to cover each step without omission.

**Final**: The LLM output gets the vocabulary and core mapping right but majorly fails by omitting an entire required role and not accurately matching RACI assignments, which are specified explicitly in the ground truth. These are significant process documentation flaws and would be unacceptable in a regulated payment setting. Thus, 5.5/10.
