### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly adopts the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") throughout, mapping them accurately from the source text without substitutions or omissions. This aligns with the ground truth's use of these terms (e.g., "**KYC Review**"). However, the ground truth integrates them more concisely into task names, and the LLM's phrasing (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary") adds unnecessary details not in the ground truth, leading to minor deductions.
  
- **Table Structure and Format (Low Alignment)**: The LLM uses a standard RACI column structure (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) with full words and Markdown, which is clear but deviates from the ground truth's role-based columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) using single letters (R, A, C, I) with bolding and a legend. The LLM adds a title and uses em-dashes (—) for empty cells, while the ground truth is more compact without these. This structural mismatch is a significant error under strict evaluation, as it doesn't replicate the ground truth's exact organization.

- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Poor Alignment)**: The LLM covers all source steps but over-splits them (e.g., 5a/5b for release/SWIFT, 6a/6b for archive/notify), introducing sub-rows not present in the ground truth, which consolidates into fewer tasks (e.g., "Release Payment" combines release and sending; "Archive Record" implies notification without splitting). Task phrasings differ (e.g., LLM's "Receive customer transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"), adding verbosity. The source text's "SWIFT message" and explicit "notify" are fragmented in the LLM but merged/absent in the ground truth, creating inconsistency. No omissions, but the expansions and differences result in substantial divergence.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Errors)**: This is the weakest area, with pervasive mismatches across all tasks:
  - E.g., Task 1: LLM assigns R/A to Transaction Analyst, I to Regulatory Liaison; ground truth has R (TA), I (RL), A (Operations Manager), C (IT Support).
  - Task 2: LLM R/A (TA), Consulted (RL); ground truth R (TA), A (RL), I (OM), C (IT).
  - Task 3: LLM R/A (RL), Consulted (TA); ground truth C (TA), R (RL), A (OM), I (IT).
  - Similar discrepancies in Tasks 4–6, including the LLM's introduction of IT Support as R/A in splits (e.g., 5b, 6a/6b), while ground truth assigns varied roles (e.g., A to OM consistently, R to IT only for archive).
  - The LLM omits "Operations Manager" entirely (a role in ground truth, potentially inferred but not mandated), leading to incomplete role coverage. Assignments rarely match (e.g., no task fully aligns), indicating fundamental misinterpretation of responsibilities from the source text.

- **Overall Strictness**: Under utmost strictness, even small phrasing differences (e.g., task wording) and empty cells deduct points, but the core failures in structure, role inclusion (missing OM), task consolidation, and RACI accuracy dominate. The LLM attempts a complete process but fails to mirror the ground truth's specific design and assignments, justifying a low score. A perfect match would require identical structure, tasks, and letters; here, it's a reinterpretation rather than replication.
