**9.2**

The LLM answer is factually correct (properly identifies "No" and cites the exact counterexamples C002 and C004 with accurate sequences, sufficient to falsify "always"). It follows the prompt's exact structure (numbered 1. and 2., cites relevant CaseIDs and sequences). No errors in logic or log interpretation.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total, per strict criteria):**
- Not fully exhaustive (omits compliant cases C001/C003 analyzed in ground truth; relevant for completeness but not required).
- Simpler format (bullets vs. ground truth's detailed case-by-case table with columns/notes/quantification of "two out of four").
- Slightly less emphatic on "always" (implies via counterexamples but lacks explicit "violates in X/4 cases").

High score reflects near-perfect alignment on core task despite stylistic/presentational differences.
