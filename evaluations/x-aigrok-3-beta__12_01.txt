The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a solid, evidence-based justification covering all three cases with accurate sequences and timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's structure and conclusion. It effectively disproves the "always" and "immediately before" claims through contradictions in Cases 1001 and 1003. However, a minor deduction is warranted for the phrasing in Case 1002 ("relationship cannot be evaluated"), which is less precise than the ground truth's explicit disproof via absence ("'always' is already disproved"), slightly weakening the universality argument without fully undermining the overall response.
