The LLM answer is almost entirely correct and matches the ground truth for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. The only discrepancy is in Q5: the LLM incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list of activities that never appear as the first event, when in fact "Quality_Check" is the first event for case C-77 (so it should NOT be in that list). All other elements of the list are correct.

Under strict grading, the presence of this small but clear error (inclusion of an element that should not be there) justifies a significant deduction, though not the loss of a majority of points. Overall, this answer is highly accurate but not perfect.
