The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering **No** and providing a precise justification that cites the exact relevant CaseIDs (C002, C004) with activity sequences and timestamps proving intervening activities, while acknowledging C001/C003 as compliant (aligning with "always" being falsified). It strictly adheres to the task format (1. Answer; 2. Justification) and relies solely on log evidence.

**Minor deductions (-0.2):** 
- Lacks the exhaustive case-by-case table format of the ground truth, which explicitly sequences *all* cases with ✅/❌ markers for visual clarity (LLM infers C001/C003 compliance without quoting their sequences verbatim).
- No significant content errors, omissions, or deviations; stylistic/presentation differences only.
