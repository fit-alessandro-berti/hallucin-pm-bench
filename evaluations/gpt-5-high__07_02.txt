9.0

The LLM answer is generally correct and delivers all substantive changes under the three requested headings.

**Positives:**
- It correctly identifies the three added tasks, providing both IDs and names.
- It correctly identifies the single removed task.
- It accurately captures the gateway-type change for Gateway_Decision.

**Minor Issues:**
- The LLM answer does not indicate the direction of the gateway change as explicitly as the ground truth ("Exclusive → Inclusive" is less specific than "Gateway_Decision changed from exclusive (XOR) in v1 to inclusive (OR) in v2"), though it is functionally equivalent.
- The format/order is slightly less verbose than the ground truth and doesn't bold the names, but those are cosmetic (which should not affect the score as per instructions).

**Strict deduction:**  
Because the answer could be more explicit regarding which gateway changed and from what (source and target type, as spelled out in the expected answer), I deduct 1 point for not providing the precise name/context and explanation of the gateway change. This loss—while relatively minor—reflects the instruction that even small errors result in significant deduction.

**Final score: 9.0**
