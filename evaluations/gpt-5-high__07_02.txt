9.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (Perfect Match)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all relevant changes: three added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), one removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway change (Exclusive to Inclusive). No extras or omissions, aligning fully with the ground truth facts. Ignores non-relevant elements (e.g., name changes, flows) as instructed.
- **Structure and Headings (Near Perfect)**: Uses the exact required headings ("Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway-type changes") with bullet-style grouping, matching the prompt's format specification. Ground truth uses slightly more formal markdown (e.g., asterisks, bolding, numbering), but this is a minor stylistic variance, not a substantive error.
- **Detail Level (Minor Deduction)**: Task listings reverse the order (ID then (Name)) compared to ground truth's (Name then (`ID`)), and the gateway description is concise ("Exclusive â†’ Inclusive") versus ground truth's expanded explanation ("exclusive (XOR) ... inclusive (OR) ... in v1 to v2"). These are small presentation differences, but under utmost strictness, they warrant a 0.5-point deduction for not mirroring the expected phrasing and structure precisely. No inclusion of the ground truth's final note, but this is optional.
- **Overall Strictness**: Factual summary is exhaustive and precise; deductions only for formatting/verbosity mismatches, which are minimal but noted as "small errors." A perfect 10.0 would require identical presentation.
