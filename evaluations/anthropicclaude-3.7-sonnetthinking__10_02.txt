### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates basic adherence to the prompt's vocabulary mandate (correct use of "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", and "Regulatory Liaison") and produces a Markdown table covering most tasks from the informal description without omissions. However, under strict evaluation criteria, it incurs significant point deductions for multiple deviations from the ground truth:

- **Structural differences (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: The table omits the "Operations Manager" column entirely, which is present in the ground truth and alters the RACI distribution. It also splits tasks differently (e.g., separate rows for "Release payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" vs. ground truth's combined "Release Payment"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"). Cells use non-standard "R/A" combinations instead of separate assignments per role, violating typical RACI clarity.
  
- **Assignment inaccuracies (major deduction: -2.5 points)**: RACI roles differ substantially across nearly every row. Examples:
  - "Receive and log transfer instruction": LLM assigns R/A to Transaction Analyst only; ground truth distributes R to Transaction Analyst, A to Operations Manager, I to Regulatory Liaison, C to IT Support.
  - "Screen payment against sanctions list": LLM R/A to Transaction Analyst; ground truth R to Transaction Analyst, A to Regulatory Liaison.
  - "Perform KYC Review": LLM R/A to Regulatory Liaison; ground truth R to Regulatory Liaison, A to Operations Manager, C to Transaction Analyst.
  - Similar mismatches in approvals, release, SWIFT, and archiving (e.g., ground truth has no "I" for Transaction Analyst in approvals, but LLM does).
  These are not minor; they fundamentally change responsibility mappings.

- **Wording and formatting errors (moderate deduction: -0.5 points)**: Task names vary (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"). Extra introductory/concluding text and a non-bolded legend add unnecessary content, deviating from the ground truth's concise table-focused format. "KYC Review" is used but prefixed with "Perform", unlike the ground truth's exact "**KYC Review**".

Overall, while the LLM captures the process flow and mandated terms, the core RACI content and structure diverge too much from the ground truth to score higher, reflecting poor fidelity even in small details like phrasing and distribution.
