4.0

**Justification and errors:**
- The answer used only the approved vocabulary for the three key roles and for the activity "KYC Review", which is good.
- **Major error:** The entire "Operations Manager" role from the ground truth is omitted. In the ground truth, this role is the Accountable party for every task. This is a significant deviation, as it removes the correct structure of governance/accountability.
- Several **Accountable assignments** are missing or misapplied. In the LLM answer, “Accountable” is only ever used paired with “Responsible,” which is usually incorrect for a RACI table. For example, Transaction Analyst cannot be both Responsible and Accountable for most tasks; this does not align with the ground truth.
- **Consulted** assignments are completely missing. For every activity in the ground truth, relevant C and I roles are present; the LLM answer omits all 'C' (Consulted) designations.
- **Task names** are sometimes non-standard or imprecise compared to the ground truth. Some tasks reflect the informal language (“Receive and log transfer instruction”) rather than the enforced phrasing (“Receive Payment Instruction”, “KYC Review”, etc). This goes against the prompt mandate to map every step to the exact organization vocabulary.
- The roles in each activity are mapped inadequately—e.g., in "Approve high-risk transactions", only Regulatory Liaison is noted (as Responsible/Accountable), but in ground truth, Transaction Analyst is Consulted, Operations Manager is Accountable, and IT Support is Informed.
- “Release payment” has Transaction Analyst as both Responsible and Accountable (incorrect) and Regulatory Liaison only Informed (it should be “I”).
- **Activity coverage** is not always complete and not always mapped to the correct vocabulary. E.g., “Archive case file” vs “Archive Record”, and activity phrasing is inconsistent.
- There are no explanations or mapping references; the ground truth cleanly traces wording.

**Summary:**  
The answer demonstrates broad understanding but fails by omitting an entire key role (“Operations Manager”), missing all Consulted assignments, mismapping Accountable parties, and not always strictly following mandated vocabulary for activities. These issues are significant and justify a strict score of 4.0.
