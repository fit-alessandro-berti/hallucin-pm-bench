The LLM answer correctly identifies the same task (`Task_CollectEquipment`) and attribute (`camunda:dueDate`) for modification, adheres to the rules by not adding/deleting elements, and provides a properly formatted unified diff with context, but loses significant points for changing the value to "P3D" instead of the ground truth "P2D" (a factual error that may not resolve the 3-day SLA breach as intended, assuming cumulative or max deadline logic), an imprecise rationale that introduces unsubstantiated "standard onboarding practices" and vaguely references "cumulative SLA breach" without explicitly matching the ground truth's "3-day SLA" and "overall onboarding cycle" details, and a diff hunk that includes unnecessary surrounding lines not present in the minimal ground truth format.
