The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in content, structure, and fidelity to the prompt's requirements (starting with "No." followed by a single-paragraph justification citing lines and case-IDs). It correctly identifies the key counterexamples in C003 (Validate_Payment before Receive_Order, with precise line references) and C005 (Validate_Payment without any Receive_Order). Minor differences include slight rephrasing (e.g., "inaccurate" vs. "false," adding timestamps which are factually correct but extraneous, and noting "before Cancel_Order" in C005 which is true but not emphasized in the ground truth), as well as paragraph-style vs. bulleted justificationâ€”these are stylistic and do not introduce errors, warranting only a small deduction for not matching the ground truth's exact formatting. Under utmost strictness, this reflects near-perfect adherence without factual inaccuracies.
