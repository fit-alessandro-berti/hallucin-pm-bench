The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying "No" and justifying with precise case-by-case sequences from the log, citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001–C004) and noting violations in C002 and C004 due to intervening activities (Pack_Items and Check_Fraud). The conclusion aligns perfectly with the ground truth's reasoning that "always" is invalidated by two cases. Minor deduction for stylistic differences: bullet-point format vs. ground truth's table (less structured for visual comparison of "Immediate successor?" marks), and inclusion of extraneous post-Validate_Payment activities (e.g., → Pack_Items in C001) that, while accurate, slightly deviate from the ground truth's focused sequences around Receive_Order only. No factual errors, but utmost strictness penalizes the subtle formatting and brevity mismatch.
