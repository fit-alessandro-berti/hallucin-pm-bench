7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all substantive changes (added tasks: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject; removed: Reject Loan; gateway change: exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision), adhering to the prompt's core requirements without mentioning ignored elements like name changes or flows. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth reduce the score significantly:

- **Formatting inconsistencies** (1.0 point deduction): Headings use "###" instead of "* **bold**"; lists use unnumbered bullets ("-") instead of numbered lists ("1.", "2.", etc.); names are in plain quotes after IDs, rather than bolded names first with IDs in backticks.
- **Content presentation differences** (1.5 point deductions): In added/removed tasks, order is ID-first instead of name-first; gateway change uses raw XML tag names ("exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway") without the ground truth's conceptual terms ("exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)"), version references ("in *v1* to ... in *v2*"), or escaped underscore in the ID ("Gateway\_Decision").
- **Missing elements** (0.5 point deduction): No concluding note like "(No other additions, removals, or gateway-type changes are present.)", which explicitly confirms completeness as in the ground truth.

These stylistic and minor descriptive variances, while not altering facts, deviate from the ground truth's exact structure and phrasing, warranting a mid-high score rather than perfect.
