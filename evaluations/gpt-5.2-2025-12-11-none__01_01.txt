**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision points (major flaws, ~50% accuracy penalty)**: 
  - Correctly identifies #1 (eligibility at Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility) but adds unrequested/inaccurate per-decision docs (e.g., includes *RefundRequestForm* which precedes it) and lacks explicit "rejected → ends" branching.
  - #2 (amount threshold): Conceptually close but **misplaced** (listed after Triage, not "after Finance_Controller_PreApprove" as in process order and GT); adds per-decision docs unnecessarily.
  - #3: **Fundamentally wrong** – attributes "gating decision" to *Process_Refund_Payment* (an execution step per process description), not to "Final payment approval at Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review" as in GT. Misses Finance as explicit decision point. No rejection outcomes emphasized.
  - Overall: Wrong order, incomplete coverage (ignores Finance_PreApprove decision), introduces false decision location → severe deduction.
- **Documents list (strong, minimal penalty)**: Complete list matches GT exactly (all 7 artefacts, AuditTrail caveat). No introductions. Per-decision docs are extraneous/unasked → minor deduction.
- **Other strictness penalties**: 
  - No table format (GT uses for clarity/precision); verbose extras (e.g., titles, sub-bullets).
  - Implicitly skips rejection logic detail.
  - No violations of "do not introduce" rule, but strict content fidelity lacking.
- **Total**: Half-credit for docs; heavy loss on core decisions (small/mid errors compounded: -2.8 total).
