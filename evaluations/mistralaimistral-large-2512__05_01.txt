**4.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Core Idea (Partial Credit)**: Correctly identifies boundary timer on `Task_Receive` jumping to `Task_Triage` to bypass for SLA. References relevant IDs. No new tasks added. Word count compliant (~60 words).
- **Major Errors (Heavy Deduction)**:
  - **Timer Type**: "Non-interrupting" vs. ground truth **"interrupting"**. Critical flaw—non-interrupting creates parallel execution without canceling/bypassing main flow (e.g., Check/GW/RequestDocs continue), failing true auto-escalation. (-4.0 points)
  - **Duration**: Vague "48 hours" vs. precise **`<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`** (BPMN ISO 8601 standard). Imprecise for XML context. (-1.0 point)
  - **New Flow ID**: Unnecessary `f10`; ground truth omits, focusing on essentials.
  - **Explanation**: Misleading ("won’t disrupt in-progress claims", "skipping if at risk")—contradicts interrupting need for enforcement; implies optional parallel path.
- **Minors**: No XML notation matching ground truth style; slightly optimistic phrasing on preservation.
- **Overall**: Functional mismatch prevents SLA compliance; ~60% alignment structurally, but semantics fail strict BPMN correctness.
