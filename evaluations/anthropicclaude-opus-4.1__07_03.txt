8.0

The LLM answer correctly lists all the functional changes and under the correct headings. However, it introduces minor formatting deviations which are significant per the instruction for utmost strictness:

- The answer adds markdown headers ("##") to each heading, deviating from the instruction to use the headings verbatim and in order, with no additional symbols or formatting.
- The enumeration of gateways includes no space between the 'Gateway_Payment:' and its change, while the ground truth has spaces for alignment. While less critical, it slightly diverges in presentation.
- The gateway changes lack the extra indentation/alignment present in the ground truth for 'GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES'.

These are minor but noticeable presentation errors when compared with the strict requirement for exact adherence to headings, their formatting, and ordering. For these reasons, the answer loses 2 points, resulting in a score of 8.0.
