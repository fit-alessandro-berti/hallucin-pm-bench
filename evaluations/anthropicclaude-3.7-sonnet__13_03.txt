### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (both correctly identify 1 occurrence in case 1002). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Strong alignment on core issues (small sample of 3 cases/<2 hours, naming inconsistencies in fraud checks). LLM's bullet-point structure is clear and stays under 120 words (~85 words). However, it lacks ground truth's quantitative precision (e.g., 14 events, frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence interval, sampling error for rare events) and deeper tie-in to matching methods (strict vs. fuzzy distortion). Additions like "case routing" and "selection criteria" are data-supported but slightly speculative in tone, diluting focus compared to ground truth's statistical emphasis. Minor losses for depth and specificity under strict criteria. Overall, highly relevant but not identical.
