5.0

Analysis:

Strengths:
- The LLM answer obeys the vocabulary mandate, correctly using "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst."
- Table is in Markdown and includes a Legend.
- Expands steps into logical discrete tasks.

Errors & Discrepancies:

**1. Missing "Operations Manager," Missing Accountability**
- The ground truth answer includes an "Operations Manager" role which acts as "Accountable (A)" for every step, but the LLM answer omits this role entirely. This is a major structural omission.

**2. Activity Wording**
- The activity wording in the ground truth is strict and, for some tasks, the LLM answer does not use the exact mandated (bolded) task names. E.g., "KYC Review" is correctly named, but the steps are at times paraphrased: "Conduct KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" instead of "KYC Review." However, this is a minor issue compared to other errors.

**3. RACI Mapping Inaccuracies**
- Several tasks are mapped imprecisely:
  - For "Screen Against Sanctions List," Regulatory Liaison should be Accountable ("A"), not just Consulted ("C") as in the LLM answer.
  - "Approve flagged high-risk transactions," Regulatory Liaison should be Accountable and Transaction Analyst should only be Consulted, not both C for both.
  - Several tasks omit the necessary division of R/A/C/I between roles.
- The LLM answer sometimes marks a role as both Responsible and Accountable (R, A), whereas the ground truth always divides accountability to "Operations Manager."

**4. Superfluous/invented tasks**
- The LLM adds "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archived case file." This is not a separate codified task in the ground truth and needlessly expands beyond requirements.

**5. Role Assignments & Participation**
- The LLM uses only three roles (omitting Operations Manager) while the ground truth includes four, which changes the RACI relationships.
- IT Support’s role is sometimes expanded inappropriately, e.g., "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archived case file."

**Overall Impact:**
- The major omission of "Operations Manager" and improper RACI mapping are significant structural flaws.
- Usage of mandated terms and generally keeping accurate task mapping are positive.
- Wording and structure errors (activity phrasing, role omissions, incorrect RACI splits) weigh heavily.

**Conclusion:**  
Due to the significant, foundational errors—particularly the absence of "Operations Manager," consistently incorrect R/A/C/I assignments in the table, and the introduction of unnecessary tasks—a strict scoring yields a **5.0**. This recognizes basic compliance with the vocabulary mandate and correct general direction, but fundamental errors and strictness of evaluation preclude a higher mark.
