### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer strictly adheres to the vocabulary mandate, using "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", and "Regulatory Liaison" exclusively without substitutions (e.g., no "CDD" or "Compliance Officer"). It covers all elements from the source text without omissions, mapping tasks like receiving/logging, screening, KYC, approval, release, SWIFT sending, archiving, and notification. The Markdown table format is clear, and the legend is provided.
- **Major Weaknesses (significant deductions)**: 
  - **Roles mismatch**: Uses only 3 roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting "Operations Manager" which is central in the ground truth (serving as Accountable for nearly all tasks). This creates incomplete coverage of the RACI framework as per the benchmark.
  - **Task breakdown and naming differences**: Expands to 8 tasks with splits (e.g., separate "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archived case file"), altering the structure. Ground truth consolidates into 6 tasks (e.g., "Release Payment" implicitly includes SWIFT; "Archive Record" includes notification via "I" to Liaison). Namings deviate slightly (e.g., "Conduct KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. concise "**KYC Review**"; "Approve flagged high-risk transactions" adds "flagged" not in source or GT).
  - **RACI assignments diverge substantially**: Even where tasks overlap, assignments rarely match. Examples:
    - Receive: LLM (Analyst R/A) vs. GT (Analyst R, Operations Manager A, Liaison I, IT C) – misses accountability and consultations.
    - Screen: LLM (Analyst R/A, Liaison C) vs. GT (Analyst R, Liaison A, Operations Manager I, IT C) – wrong accountability (Liaison as C vs. A).
    - KYC Review: Partial overlap (both have Analyst C, Liaison R/A), but GT adds Operations Manager A and IT I.
    - Approve: Similar partial overlap, but again misses Operations Manager A and IT I.
    - Release: LLM (Analyst R/A, Liaison C) vs. GT (Analyst R, Liaison I, Operations Manager A, IT C) – incorrect accountability and consultation.
    - Archive/Notify: LLM splits into two tasks with IT R/A and Liaison I; GT combines with Analyst C, Liaison I, Operations Manager A, IT R – structural and assignment mismatch.
  - No bolding or exact formatting match to GT (e.g., GT bolds R/A and uses "**KYC Review**").
- **Overall**: While vocabulary is perfect (worth ~2 points), the structural, role, task, and RACI deviations are core failures against the ground truth, warranting strict penalties. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply.
