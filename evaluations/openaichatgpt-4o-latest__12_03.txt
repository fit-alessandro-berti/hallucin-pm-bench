9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and parallels the ground truth answer very closely:

**Strengths:**  
- Correct answer ("No").
- Explicitly analyzes each case with correct activity order.
- Justifies the answer by naming cases and providing the sequence.
- Clearly identifies where the "immediately after" condition fails (C002 and C004), matching the ground truth.

**Minor issue:**  
- The answer formats the justification as a bullet list, not a markdown table. While this is a stylistic rather than a substantive difference, part of the ground truth's reasoning is its tabular clarity and inclusion of a "Immediate successor?" column and "Notes." The LLM answer, though thorough, is a bit less structured and doesn't explicitly call out the ‘immediate successor’ status for each as in the table, nor the “2 out of 4 cases” final quantitative comparison.

As per the instructions, even small differences should result in significant point losses. Thus, for the slightly less precise structure and minor omissions, a 1-point penalty is applied.

**Final score:** 9.0
