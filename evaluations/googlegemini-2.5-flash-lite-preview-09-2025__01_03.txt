7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM accurately identifies and summarizes the two decision points with phrasing that closely aligns with the ground truth (e.g., correct conditions for the risk-based skip and the "at least two approvals" rule for TriVote). Minor wording differences (e.g., "does not exceed €250,000" vs. "≤ €250 000"; "provide their approval" vs. "record 'Approve'") are semantically equivalent and do not alter meaning, warranting no significant deduction. Score: 9.8/10.
- **Part (b)**: The list is mostly correct in order and content but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document (explicitly listed in the ground truth and process step 8, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7). This results in an incomplete enumeration of *all* required documents (8 items vs. 9), a clear factual error that violates the "list **all** documents" instruction. No other errors or hallucinations. Score: 5.0/10.
- **Overall**: Weighted average (equal parts) with strict penalties for incompleteness yields 7.5. The response is structured well and avoids extraneous content, but the document omission is a non-trivial gap under strict criteria.
