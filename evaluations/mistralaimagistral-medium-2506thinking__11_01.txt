7.5

The LLM answer is largely accurate in identifying and ranking the three worst-performing activities by waiting time, precisely quoting the average and 95th percentile wait times from the table:

1. **Request_Documents – avg 36.5 h, p95 120.0 h**
2. **Send_Closure_Letter – avg 12.2 h, p95 44.0 h**
3. **Assess_Liability – avg 7.8 h, p95 16.4 h**

**Strengths:**  
- The memo stays strictly within the requested activities and waiting-time metrics.
- Waiting-time numbers quoted verbatim from the input.
- Each action recommendation is plausible and data-driven (though not as concrete or grounded in empirical results as the ground truth).
- The response is under 150 words.

**Errors (strict):**
- **Request_Documents**: “the system complaints for frequent document types” is a fragmented, likely erroneous phrase. Also, the recommendation is not as concrete as the ground truth, which cites pilot test evidence and a quantified impact.
- **Send_Closure_Letter**: While pre-generating templates and automating dispatch is sensible, the ground truth specifies a switch to e-signature letters, which is more specific and practical; the LLM's recommendation could be interpreted as procedural optimization rather than tech transformation. Impact estimates (“estimated 30% reduction” in ground truth) are missing.
- **Assess_Liability**: The LLM recommends redistributing claims by workload, whereas the ground truth calls for rules-engine pre-classification to let simple cases bypass the senior queue—a more targeted and technologically informed fix.
- Extra non-memo content appears: “*Author: Core Process & Automation, 2025*” and a [Summary] section, which directly violate the prompt (should be only the memo text, ≤150 words, no summary, no credits).
- The LLM repeats instructions about service time/throughput (“…without focusing on service times or throughput”), which the ground truth does not do.
- The action recommendations mostly lack explicit prediction (“cut wait by 20%+”), as required.

Overall, the answer is essentially correct in data and scope but loses substantial points for missing elements of specificity, explicit quantified impact, slightly off-target actions, minor textual errors, and the addition of extraneous non-memo content.
