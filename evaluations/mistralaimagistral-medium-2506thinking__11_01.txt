### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match—top three activities ranked correctly by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), with verbatim quotes for avg and 95th-percentile times. No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities mentioned. (+10 points base)
- **No unwarranted content**: Core memo adheres, but extraneous additions ([Summary], *Author* line, \boxed{150}) bloat the response beyond a "crisp executive memo," violating the ≤150-word crispness and introducing meta-commentary not requested. (-1.5 points)
- **Action relevance**: All actions are concrete, tied to waiting-time issues, and implicitly data-driven (e.g., leveraging analytics/workflows). However, they differ notably from ground truth: #1 has a clear typo ("complaints" likely meant "complements," undermining professionalism); #2 is similar but lacks ground truth's "estimated 30%" specificity; #3 proposes redistribution vs. ground truth's pre-classification, making it less aligned. No per-action ≥20% quantification or supporting data (e.g., "pilot tests" or estimates), weakening "data-driven" claim despite overall memo statement. Strict penalty for deviations and lack of verbatim-like precision. (-1.5 points total)

Overall: Strong on essentials but penalized heavily for phrasing/action differences, typo, and extras under utmost strictness (adjusted from 8.5 base). Memo word count ~120, compliant.
