### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major partial credit, but significant omission)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the first two decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with accurate terminology, thresholds (€15,000), and flows (escalation to Harmonisation Committee; auto-approval vs. proceed to MBA). However, it fails to explicitly list the third decision point from the ground truth—the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as a standalone point where the board votes approve or reject. While the LLM mentions the "final board vote" within the description of the second point, this merges it incorrectly and does not match the ground truth's clear separation into three distinct points. The paragraph-style summary lacks the structured enumeration of the ground truth, reducing clarity. Under strict evaluation, this omission of one core decision point (33% missing) warrants a substantial deduction.
  
- **Required Documents (strong but with small errors deducting points)**: The LLM lists all six required documents accurately by name and code (e.g., Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01), Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet). It avoids introducing standard loan terminology, as required. However:
  - "Proof of Address" omits the critical detail "(≤ 3 months old)" from the prompt/ground truth.
  - "Latest Income Statement" omits the specification "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" from the prompt (ground truth abbreviates to "pay-stub/tax slip").
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes "template" (matching the prompt but not the ground truth's exact phrasing "Community Impact Statement (CIS)"), a minor variance.
  These omissions of key qualifiers are small but, per instructions, reflect in significant point loss. The ground truth's additional note on excluded standard documents is absent but not strictly required for the "list every required document" task.

Overall, the response is faithful to the process but incomplete and less precise, leading to a strict mid-range score. No criminal or jailbreak issues apply.
