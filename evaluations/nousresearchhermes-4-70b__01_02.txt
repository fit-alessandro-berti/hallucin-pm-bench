8.0

The LLM answer demonstrates good understanding of the process, uses almost all the required terminology, and explicitly covers the two main decision points (**Underwriter Alignment Gate**, **Amount Threshold Decision**) and their criteria. It also enumerates all six required documents using correct names.

However, there are noticeable deviations from the ground truth:

- The LLM omits the explicit mention of the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a standalone decision point; it refers to the board's involvement but doesn't distinctly label this as a separate decision gate.
- The answer’s description of the Amount Threshold Decision point is accurate but slightly less precise—it doesn't explicitly mention the sequence ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
- There is some slight paraphrasing ("the system issues an auto-approval," "the loan proceeds to... MBA") rather than following the process wording as in the prompt.
- It does not mention that "no credit bureau report, collateral forms..." are needed, which rounds out the full required-documents instruction in the ground truth.
- For document details, it omits the "≤ 3 months" for Proof of Address, doesn't specify that the income document can be either "pay-stub or tax slip," and could be more explicit with "CIS template" (it says "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template," which is mostly correct but could be more categorical with "template").

Given these lapses in exactness, adherence to terminology, and omission of secondary clarifying points, a strict score of 8.0 is warranted: complete in main contents but penalized for deviation from exact phrasing, partial omission, and partial loss of detail.
