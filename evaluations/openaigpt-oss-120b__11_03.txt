### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying the exact three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, with precise quantification of exceedances (+300 s, +300 s, +60 s) and matching waiting time figures. Structure follows the memo format, uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations, and sticks to provided data without extraneous activities or metrics. Word count is approximately 150, and it returns only the memo text.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Header differences** (-0.5): Missing "From" line; subject phrasing varies ("Performance Gaps" vs. "Throughput Bottlenecks"); no date/sample specifier (e.g., "April 2025 sample"), which grounds the GT more specifically.
- **Introduction variances** (-0.5): Less precise than GT's reference to "4 805 completed cases" (derivable from table totals) and "largest queues"; LLM's "end-to-end processing" is vaguer.
- **Activity listing minor formatting** (-0.2): Similar content but differences in emphasis (e.g., LLM uses asterisks/em-dashes; GT uses bold and semicolons).
- **Recommendations mismatch** (-1.0): Core content differs entirely in actions (e.g., LLM's "fast-track legal review with 50% cut" vs. GT's "rule-based pre-checks bypass"; similar for others). LLM invents unsubstantiated percentages (50%, 30%, 40% reductions), violating "data-driven" by introducing non-table metrics; GT's inventions (e.g., "â‚¬25 k") are less quantified but still diverge. No concluding projection sentence in LLM, which GT includes for impact.
- **Overall fidelity** : Strong on facts (85% match) but loses significantly on creative yet mismatched recommendations and subtle grounding details.

Total deductions reflect strict penalty for any deviation, prioritizing exact alignment to ground truth.
