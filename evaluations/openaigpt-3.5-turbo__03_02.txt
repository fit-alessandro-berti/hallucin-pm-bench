**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major structural deviations (critical loss: -4.0)**: LLM uses a non-BPMN-standard schema ("process" > "tasks"/"flows" only, no element types like `startEvent`, `exclusiveGateway`, `parallelGateway`, `eventBasedGateway`, `intermediateCatchEvent`). Ground truth is explicit BPMN 2.0 with typed elements and conditions. No `startEvent`, `endEvent`, or `terminateEndEvent`.
- **Incomplete/missing core elements (-2.5)**: No `cancelEvent`/`terminate` (point 10 explicit). No proper classification `exclusiveGateway` or conditions ("simple"/"complex"). No `eventBasedGateway`/`timer`/`message` events for wait/reply/reminder logic (points 7-9). No `parallelGateway` fork/join for send/log parallel (point 6; LLM forces sequential `send -> log`).
- **Broken flows/logic (-1.0)**: Complex path dead-ends (`root-cause-analysis` has no outgoing flow to `provide-resolution`). `wait-customer-reply` unconditionally flows to `close-ticket` (ignores distinct reply vs. timeout paths). Boundary event mis-models timer/reminder (not a task, no "once" logic).
- **Hallucinations/inventions (-0.5)**: Invented `route-to-resolution` task/gateway substitute (not described).
- **Minor mismatches**: Combined "parse & create" (ground truth separates); imprecise names/flows.

Total fidelity ~20% (basic tasks/sequence partially match, but core BPMN logic fails entirely). Strict penalty reflects "faithful" requirement and "utmost strictness".
