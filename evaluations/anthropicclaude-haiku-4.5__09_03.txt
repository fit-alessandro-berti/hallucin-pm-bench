The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of computation due to redacted data in Artefact A, precisely explains the need for start_time and complete_time values specifically for "Approve Invoice" instances, and notes that Artefact B cannot substituteâ€”mirroring the ground truth's core reasoning on absent timestamps, event rows, and inability to calculate average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval. However, it incurs significant deductions for violating the "Respond in plain text, no tables" instruction by using Markdown formatting (# headers, ## subheaders, **bold**, and --- separator), adding unrequested extra content (a "Recommendation" section with suggestions for proceeding, which exceeds the task's scope of stating why in "one short paragraph" without guessing or outside input), and being more verbose and structured than the concise, direct plain-text style of the ground truth. These formatting and extraneous elements introduce deviations that dilute adherence to the prompt's constraints.
