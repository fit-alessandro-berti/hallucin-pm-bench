**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment, justifying high score):** Identical three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), correctly selected based on multi-metric table data (high wait/rework/SLA drops). Explanations strictly table-based, citing precise metrics (e.g., LLM accurately flags 150min wait, 22% rework, 12.4% SLA, stdev=9; ranks "third-longest wait/third-highest SLA" correctly). One concrete, data-driven action per activity, tied to cited issues (e.g., digital tools for wait/rework; workflows for variability/SLA). Concise (<200 words), executive format, no hallucinations or absent activities.
- **Differences/deductions (-0.8 total, strict per instructions):** Stylistic/phrasing variances (LLM formal header/Date/Note vs. GT simpler title/narrative; different metric emphases, e.g., LLM omits throughput drop/12-25min processing highlighted in GT, adds unmentioned "propagates downstream"). Actions similar in intent but non-identical wording/specificity (e.g., LLM "centralized portal" vs. GT "same-day digital + validation"; LLM tiered workflow vs. GT AI/squad; minor mismatch in Initial_Assessment variability emphasis). No GT projection or bolding. No guessing on differentiation (both imply clear). Small extras (Note) and omissions prevent perfect 10.0.
