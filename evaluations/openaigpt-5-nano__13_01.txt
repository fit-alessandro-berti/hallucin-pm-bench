9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer against the ground truth with utmost strictness, penalizing even minor deviations in wording, formatting, precision, or completeness. The total score reflects near-exact alignment but docks points for small phrasing inconsistencies, slight incompleteness in Q3, and minor elaborations in Q4 that, while not hallucinatory, exceed the "directly derived" ideal without adding error.

- **Q1**: "1 time" is functionally equivalent to "1 occurrence" but uses different wording ("time" vs. "occurrence"), violating strict case-sensitive and precise matching. Deduction: -0.3.
- **Q2**: "5.56%" matches the calculation and rounding exactly, but lacks the space after the percentage (ground truth: "5.56 %"). Minor formatting error. Deduction: -0.1.
- **Q3**: "A1002" correctly identifies the case but omits the explicit "Only case" qualifier and formatting (e.g., bolding), making it less precise as a full list description. Ground truth emphasizes singularity. Deduction: -0.4.
- **Q4**: Provides two valid reasons (small sample size with variance/extrapolation details; temporal bias with single-day coverage and non-representative sampling). These align with ground truth options (small sample size; temporal bias) and are clearly stated without hallucination, though elaborations like "high sampling variance" and "seasonal...variation" add slight interpretive depth not in the ideal. No major deduction: -0.0.
