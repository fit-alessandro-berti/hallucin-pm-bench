9.0

1) The answer "1 time" is fully correct.
2) "5.56%" is matched and correct, though the explicit calculation is absent; since the "round to two decimals" is respected, the omission of the calculation merits a small deduction.
3) "A1002" is the precise and complete list of case identifiersâ€”correct.
4) Both reasons are valid and clearly stated. The first point covers small sample size with adequate detail. The second correctly highlights the non-representativeness of the temporal window (single day) and lack of seasonal/daily/weekly coverage. Minor reductions for not explicitly mentioning "case-mix bias" or "survivorship/truncation bias", but since at least two are required and these are among those possible, the expectations are met.

Strictly applying the grading rubric: a small deduction (1 point) for not stating the calculation explicitly in Q2. Otherwise, all information matches the ground-truth and does not overstep what is supported in the data.
