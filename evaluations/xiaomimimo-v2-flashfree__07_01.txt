The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes per the prompt (added: check_vip, generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway: gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway). It uses exact headings with • as specified, lists only ids (which are the precise element identifiers in XML), and avoids extras/speculation. Ground truth differs in: headings (**bold** without •), list style (* vs -), task presentation (full name + id=`id` vs id only), gateway phrasing (explicit v1/v2 + bold vs concise arrow), and extra note. Semantic match is perfect (100% accurate diffs), but strict textual/format differences deduct 1.0 point total.
