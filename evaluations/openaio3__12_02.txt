The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It answers "No" (as required), then justifies with specific references to case-ids and line numbers. Both counterexamples (C003: lines 6/7; C005: line 11) are clearly stated, and it references which cases do match the rule as well. The only reason for a minor deduction is that the justification is slightly more verbose and "front-loads" the conforming cases (C001, C002, C004) before mentioning the relevant violations, whereas the gold-standard focuses only on the counterexamples. However, there are no material factual or interpretational errors. Thus, the answer is nearly perfect but could be a touch more direct in citing only the necessary counterexamples.
