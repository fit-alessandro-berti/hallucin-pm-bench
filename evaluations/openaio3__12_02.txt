The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, correctly identifying "No" as the response and providing a precise justification focused on the key counterexamples in cases C003 (lines 6-7) and C005 (line 11), with identical line citations and reasoning about the absence of Receive_Order where needed. The only minor deviation is the inclusion of unnecessary positive examples (C001, C002, C004), which slightly dilutes conciseness compared to the ground truth's direct bullet-point focus on counterexamples alone, warranting a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria despite no factual errors.
