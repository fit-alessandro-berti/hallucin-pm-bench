The LLM answer gets Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 correct. However, for Q5 it omits "Validate_Order" and "Pack_Items" (which do never appear as a first event), and incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which is the first event for C-77). This is a significant factual error and critical for process mining analysis. Though 4 of 5 answers are correct, the miss on Q5 is substantial, so a strict evaluation deducts significant points.
