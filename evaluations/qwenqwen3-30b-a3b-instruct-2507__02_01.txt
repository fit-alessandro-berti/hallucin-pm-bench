### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1-Q4**: Identical to ground truth (perfect match, no deductions).
- **Q5**: Significant errorsâ€”list includes "Quality_Check" (which incorrectly appears as a first event in case C-77, per log) and "Ship_Order" (correct), but omits "Validate_Order" and "Pack_Items" (both never first events). This is a major deviation (2/3 items wrong/missing), warranting heavy deduction under strict criteria. Overall answer is 80% accurate but fails exactness in a multi-element field.
