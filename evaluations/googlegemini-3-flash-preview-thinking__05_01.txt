**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core idea partially correct (+2.0)**: Suggests interrupting boundary timers jumping directly to **Task_Triage** to bypass delays and meet SLA, aligning with reuse of existing elements and no new tasks.
- **Major deviations (-4.0 total)**:
  - Suggests **three timers** (on **Task_Receive**, **Task_Check**, **Task_RequestDocs**) vs. ground truth's **one timer** on **Task_Receive** only. Violates "one improvement"; adds unnecessary redundancy/complexity.
  - Wrong placements: Timers on later tasks (**Task_Check**, **Task_RequestDocs**) fail to measure from submission (**Start_Claim**), allowing >48h total before firing.
  - Vague config: "48-hour duration relative to **Start_Claim** timestamp" unspecified (no XML like `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`); boundary timers measure from *task start*, not process start.
  - Multiple "new sequence flows" vs. one; no specific timer ID (e.g., "Timer_48h").
- **Minor issues (-0.5)**: Longer explanation; doesn't precisely note "bypassing outstanding document requests."
- Strict scoring: Significant structural/accuracy gaps outweigh partial match; not interchangeable with ground truth.
