**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Identification of three worst-performing activities (major failure, ~40% weight)**: Ground truth correctly identifies **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment** based on clear table leaders in low throughput (190/185), high wait (150/30/18 min), high proc time (25/12 min), high rework (22%/5.3%/1.8%), and high SLA breach (5.5%/12.4%/3.2%). LLM picks **Request_Documents** (correct), but **Check_Coverage** (mid-tier: throughput 270, wait 4 min *low*, SLA 1.5% *low*) and **Register_Claim** (best: throughput 280 *highest*, wait 2 min *lowest*, SLA 0.1% *lowest*). Wrong picks = total mismatch on 2/3.
- **Explanations (major failure, ~30% weight)**: Request_Documents ok (cites 150 min wait, 22% rework). Check_Coverage fabricates "12.4% SLA breach" (*actual 1.5%; that's Review_Documents* – blatant table misread/hallucination). Register_Claim falsely claims "high variability: stdev 1 min" (*low; others 2-9*) and "large processing-time variation" (*proc 3 min lowest*). No strict table fidelity.
- **Recommendations (partial failure, ~20% weight)**: Semi-concrete but not data-driven (e.g., automation for Request ok-ish; checklists/training generic, not tied to stdev/SLA; studies vague). Ground truth ties precisely (e.g., "halves rework", "trim proc time").
- **Other (minor deductions, ~10% weight)**: ≤200 words ok (185). Memo format ok. No absent activities. But invents issues ("inconsistent staff handling" unsupported).

**Cumulative**: 1/3 activities correct + factual errors + weak data linkage = severe deviations. No guessing noted despite unclear diffs, but LLM guessed wrongly.
