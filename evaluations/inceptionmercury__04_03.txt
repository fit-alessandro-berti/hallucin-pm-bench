The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and pinpoints the key violation in Rule 3, matching the ground truth. However, it deducts significant points due to factual inconsistencies and errors in the justification for Rules 1 and 2: it erroneously labels them as "Violations" while correctly stating they are satisfied, introducing contradictory and misleading phrasing. Rule 4 is accurately assessed. The format deviates from the ground truth's table but aligns with the prompt's request for a short justification; minor structural differences alone warrant no further deduction, but content errors reflect substantial loss under strict evaluation criteria.
