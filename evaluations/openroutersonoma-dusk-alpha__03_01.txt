### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the overall flow structure, including the start, classification, password reset path, diagnosis branch, resolution/forwarding, confirmation, and rework loop back to "Initial Diagnosis" (line 9). It correctly uses three exclusive gateways (despite the prompt mentioning only "two," which appears to be a prompt oversight, as the ground truth uses three) and keeps the output concise (<40 lines). However, under utmost strictness, several critical differences from the ground truth and prompt result in significant deductions:

- **Invented activities (major hallucination, -4.0 points)**: Adds unmentioned tasks "Submit Support Ticket" (t1) and "Specialist Work" (t7). The prompt explicitly forbids inventing activities (line 1 starts the process at submission via start event; line 6 implies forwarding directly leads to "Resolve Issue" without a separate specialist task). This violates the "do not invent" rule and the hallucination trap's focus on fabricated elements.
  
- **Naming inaccuracies (-1.0 point)**: "Classify Ticket" (t2) vs. ground truth "Auto-Classification" (prompt line 2 specifies "automatically classified"). Gateways unnamed (ground truth names them descriptively, e.g., "Password Reset?"). Start event unnamed (ground: "Ticket Submitted"); end unnamed (ground: "Ticket Closed").

- **Missing BPMN standards (-0.5 point)**: No `<conditionExpression>` on gateway flows (ground truth uses `yes`/`no` for exclusive gateways; LLM relies on flow `name` attributes, which is non-standard for decisions).

- **Structural extras (-0.5 point)**: Includes unnecessary diagram namespaces (`bpmndi`, `dc`, `di`) despite prompt stating "No diagram/interchange elements are required."

These errors deviate from the exact translation required, introducing fabrications that alter the process model. The core loop and paths are intact, preventing a total failure score, but the inventions alone warrant a low rating.
