**9.2**

The LLM answer is factually accurate, correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate, cites all relevant case IDs (1001-1003) with precise timestamps and activities from the log, and provides a valid short justification disproving "always immediately before" via reverse order (1001, 1003) and absence (1002). However, strict evaluation reveals minor differences from ground truth warranting deductions:

- **No explicit verdict structure** (GT: "**Short verdict:** The fact is **inaccurate**."; LLM embeds in paragraph without bolding/headers; -0.3).
- **Less explicit on ordering** (GT clearly states "**before**", "**reversed**", "**not after it**", "**in none**; LLM relies on timestamps alone without verbalizing "reversed" or "never"; reader must infer from times; -0.3).
- **No line citations** (GT uses "lines 3-4", "11 & 14"; LLM uses timestamps instead, equally valid but not matching GT format; -0.1).
- **Slightly wordier/repetitive** (LLM intro + cases + repeat conclusion; GT more concise bullets + summary; -0.1).

No factual errors or guesses; high fidelity but not identical in phrasing/structure.
