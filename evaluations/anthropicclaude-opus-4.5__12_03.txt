The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in all key respects: correct "No" verdict, exhaustive coverage of all four relevant cases (C001–C004), precise sequences with intervening activities correctly identified for counterexamples (C002: Pack_Items; C004: Check_Fraud), confirmation of holding cases (C001, C003), and conclusion that "always" fails due to two violations. Justification cites exact CaseIDs and sequences as required. Minor stylistic differences (narrative with subheadings and timestamps vs. table with ✅/❌) do not constitute errors, as the task specifies no format and prioritizes accuracy/content. No factual deviations, omissions, or inaccuracies under strict evaluation.
