**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (full credit areas)**: Correctly identifies **all** changes under **exactly** the required headings. Added tasks (3 correct by name), removed tasks (1 correct by name), gateway-type change (correct type shift: exclusive → inclusive). No extraneous changes mentioned (ignores renamings like "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name, flows, etc.). Complete and accurate summary of substance.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Missing IDs** (-1.0 total): Ground truth includes precise BPMN IDs (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity`) for all added/removed tasks; LLM omits entirely. Meticulous XML analysis requires IDs for unambiguity.
  - **Gateway details incomplete** (-0.5): Omits specific ID ("Gateway_Decision"), technical terms (XOR/OR), and version refs (*v1*/*v2*). Vague phrasing ("Exclusive gateway" vs. explicit "**Gateway_Decision** changed from **exclusive** (XOR)...").
  - **Formatting/Structure deviations** (-0.5): Bullets vs. numbered lists; plain text vs. **bold** names/backticks; no final completeness note. Minor but "small errors" warrant loss per instructions.
- **Overall**: Semantically 95%+ match (no factual errors), but precision/detail gaps vs. ground truth drop from 10.0. Utmost strictness applied proportionally.
