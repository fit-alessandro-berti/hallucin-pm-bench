The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B, lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format per line. It ignores Process A as instructed. The sole issue is a minor formatting discrepancy: a leading space on the second line and lack of alignment padding (e.g., extra spaces before the em dash in the second pair to match the first pair's length), which deviates slightly from the ground truth's precise whitespace. Under utmost strictness, this small error warrants a deduction, but the content is otherwise identical to the ground truth.
