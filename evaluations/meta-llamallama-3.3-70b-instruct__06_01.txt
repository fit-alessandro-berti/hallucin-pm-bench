7.5

The LLM answer provides both correct task pairs and no incorrect ones. However, there are noticeable formatting errors:

1. There is an extra space at the beginning of the second line, before "Procure_Materials".
2. The dash separator in the first line does not strictly match the required format (should be '  —  ' with two spaces on either side, but only one space is used).
3. The order is not strictly respected: the overall list should be alphabetically ordered, but "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" comes before "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines", whereas "Create_Documentation" comes after "Procure_Materials" alphabetically.

These issues, though minor, violate the formatting and ordering requirements and thus should be penalized according to the instruction to be strict and allow even small errors to result in significant point loss. However, the content (correct pairs) is entirely accurate, so the majority of the score is preserved.
