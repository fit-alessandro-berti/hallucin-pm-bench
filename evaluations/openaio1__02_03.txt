The LLM answer is semantically identical and correct in content, accurately identifying the 3 cases, the preceding activity (Pack_Items) for C456, and the unique activity (Cancel_Order). However, it incurs a minor deduction for slight verbosity (e.g., full sentences instead of minimal phrases) and lack of exact labeling (A1/A2/A3), deviating from the ground truth's concise, labeled format despite the prompt's call for "concise, bullet-point answers only."
