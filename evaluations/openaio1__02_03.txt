9.8

- The LLM answer is clear, accurate, concise, and uses bullet points as requested.  
- All three answers are fully correct, clearly addressing:
    1. The correct number and list of distinct case values.
    2. The preceding activity for the specified case/activity.
    3. The activity appearing exactly once.
- The only minor deviation from ground truth is that the LLM formats the answer with slightly more words (e.g., "There are 3 distinct cases: ..." instead of just "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"). This introduces slight verbosity and a formatting difference (using a bullet character instead of *). 
- Since the instruction is to penalize even small errors, this very minimal discrepancy results in a very small deduction.

**Lost 0.2 for formatting/concisenessâ€”but substantively perfect.**
