4.0

- **Terminology:** The LLM answer correctly uses all three required terms (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”) and avoids the forbidden words. This is a major strength.
- **Column headers:** Uses abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of the required full role names (“Account Manager”, etc.), which is a significant deviation from the ground truth.
- **RACI assignments:** 
    - The LLM answer assigns only R/A parings, omitting “C” (Consulted) and “I” (Informed) responsibilities entirely. This fails to accurately map the multi-role involvement shown in the ground truth.
    - In several activities (e.g., Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer), the LLM answer assigns only to Account Manager, ignoring other roles that should be Consulted or Informed.
    - KYC Review assigns both R and A to Compliance Officer, whereas the ground truth assigns only R to Compliance Officer, but A to Account Manager.
    - Payment Clearance assignment is “R/A” solely to Finance Clerk, while ground truth has R for Finance Clerk, A for Account Manager, and others as C/I.
- **Formatting:** The matrix is formatted correctly otherwise, and does not add or omit activities.
- **Summary:** 
    - Correct process activity terms.
    - Major errors in role header labeling.
    - Major errors in RACI task allocations (missing C/I, and misattributed A’s and R’s).
    - No forbidden terms or extra content.

Strictly following the guidelines, these serious omissions and misassignments warrant a strong point deduction. Thus, a 4.0 score is appropriate.
