5.0

The LLM answer incorrectly assesses R2 as Compliant, missing that the Change_Request triggers a new required Manager_Approval (on 07-Mar), making Ship_Goods (05-Mar) occur before the last approval and outside the 2-day window post-approval. This is a major analytical error, as it overlooks the interplay between R5 and R2. R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6 match status and are justified adequately (all â‰¤20 words). Overall result matches, but the incomplete violation identification reduces score significantly under strict criteria. Format is mostly compliant but lacks table structure of ground truth.
