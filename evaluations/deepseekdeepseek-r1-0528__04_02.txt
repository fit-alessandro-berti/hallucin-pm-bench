6.5

**Justification:**  
- R1: Correct (Compliant, explanation sufficient).
- R2: **Incorrect.** LLM claims Compliant, but according to the rules, after a Change_Request post-approval, a new Manager_Approval is required before further processing (per R5), and since Ship_Goods occurred before the new Manager_Approval on 7-Mar, it violates R2 because the correct "last required approval" is not the Finance_Approval but the new Manager_Approval after the Change_Request. LLM overlooked this, resulting in a substantive rule misinterpretation.
- R3: Correct (Violated, reason correct).
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable; justification matches).
- R5: Correct (Violated, reason matches).
- R6: Correct.

**Additional Notes:**  
LLM’s justification for R2 is a common error: it used the “Finance_Approval” timing, missing that new approvals were required due to the Change_Request (see ground truth). This is a significant compliance logic miss. Justifications are otherwise concise and accurate. All other rules are handled well.

**Score loss reasons:**  
- Major error in R2 (compliance logic/sequence misunderstood): −2.5 points  
- Otherwise accurate and concise, but small language variances/justification detail differences mean −1 point

**Total: 6.5**
