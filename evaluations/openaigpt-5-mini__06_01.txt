The LLM answer precisely matches the required output format, content, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and across the list), and identifies exactly the two parallel pairs described in Process B ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"). Minor presentational differences in spacing/alignment (e.g., ground truth's aligned dashes) do not constitute errors under the prompt's specifications, which focus on pairs, order, and format rather than visual alignment. No rationale was requested or included, aligning with instructions.
