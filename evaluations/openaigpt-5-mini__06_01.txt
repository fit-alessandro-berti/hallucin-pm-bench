9.0

The LLM answer is mostly correct: it lists exactly the two pairs that can occur in parallel according to Process B, and it ignores Process A. However, it loses a full point for *not strictly adhering to the output format* in the instructions:

- The pair "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" is missing the **required padding/alignment** between task names as shown in the ground truth. Ground truth specifies two spaces (at least) after "Procure_Materials" before the dash, whereas the LLM used just one.
- There is also no use of code block formatting (the triple backticks), but since only the textual output format is demanded ("Output one pair per line, using the format `Task_X — Task_Y`"), and the LLM did output one per line, this is a very minor point.
- The order within each pair is alphabetical, and the overall list is in alphabetical order per the first task.

Overall, the answer is semantically complete but slightly careless in formatting (spacing). Given the "utmost strictness" instruction, this earns a **9.0**. If the formatting deviated further or there were any content errors, it would be lower.
