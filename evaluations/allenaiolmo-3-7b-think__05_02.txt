The LLM answer fails catastrophically on format (full XML instead of single-hunk unified diff), targets the wrong task/attribute/value (Task_GrantAccess to P6D instead of Task_CollectEquipment to P2D), and provides an incompatible rationale (extending a deadline vs. contracting the bottleneck for a 3-day SLA), violating the strict output rules and ground truth entirely.
