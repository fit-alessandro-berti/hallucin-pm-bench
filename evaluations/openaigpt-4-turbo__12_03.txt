The LLM answer is factually correct, accurately identifies both counterexamples (C002 and C004) with precise sequences and timestamps, and directly fulfills the task requirements (Yes/No + justification citing relevant CaseIDs/sequences). It contradicts the "always" claim effectively without errors.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Lack of exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all 4 cases (omits confirming C001/C003 as compliant, unlike ground truth table).
- Different format (numbered list vs. table + summary quantification of "two out of four").
- Slightly less structured conclusion phrasing.

No factual inaccuracies or small errors; differences are primarily in completeness and presentation.
