**9.0**

The LLM answer is semantically equivalent and highly accurate to the prompt's requirements, modeling all explicitly mentioned flow elements (8 tasks with near-verbatim names, ignoring case as standard BPMN convention; required gateways; exactly 2 end events; correct loop for re-validation; parallel split/join; rejection path; IDs prefixed "wrc_"). It correctly inserts the "**checks warranty eligibility**" task before the warranty gateway (omitted in ground truth, but explicitly required by prompt step 3). The intermediate catch event accurately models the stated "waits until it is received" without inventing error-handling/escalations. Minor deductions (-1.0 total): extra DI section (unnecessary for minimal XML but valid); slight start event name variation ("Customer submits online warranty claim" vs prompt phrasing). No omissions; no hallucinated paths. Ground truth itself omits a required task and explicit wait modeling, making LLM superior per prompt/rubric.
