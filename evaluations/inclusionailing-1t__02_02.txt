3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1 (Distinct Cases)**: Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003). However, the reasoning is convoluted with fabricated set notations (e.g., "{“C”, “C”, “”} = {“”, “”} = {}") and typos, indicating confusion and minor hallucinations. Strict deduction: 0.8/1.0.
- **Q2 (Sequence for C002)**: Sequence is factually correct (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order) and uses the required "→" separator with underscores matching the log. However, presentation is messy with inconsistent separators (e.g., ">" or "- >" in drafts), backslashes, and embedded meta-comments (e.g., "Error Correction Notice"). Strict deduction for formatting noise: 0.9/1.0.
- **Q3 (Predecessors of Ship_Order)**: Fundamentally incorrect. Fabricates "Receive_Order" as a predecessor (hallucination—it does not immediately precede Ship_Order in any case; Check_Stock does for C001 and C003). Lists three items instead of two distinct ones. Alphabetical order attempted but flawed (includes wrong item). Formatting errors: missing underscores (e.g., "Check_stock"), lowercase ("receive_order"), and inconsistent capitalization. No match to ground truth (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock only). Strict deduction: 0.0/1.0.
- **Overall Response Quality**: Buried in excessive rambling, meta-thoughts (e.g., "Q&A time:)Q&A based on data:)"), emojis (e.g., "✅✅✅Done!"), abbreviations (e.g., "C3 – Receive_Order → 9:21:3"), and irrelevant asides (e.g., timestamp validity digressions). Violates clean, direct response expectation; treats as severe hallucination and noise. Deduction: -0.7 overall (compounds errors).
- **Total Score Calculation**: (0.8 + 0.9 + 0.0)/3 - 0.7 = ~3.0. Strictness applied: Even partial correctness in Q1/Q2 cannot offset Q3 failure and pervasive disorganization, per instructions emphasizing hallucinations and precision.
