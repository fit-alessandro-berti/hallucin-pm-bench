9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks in Process B, numbers them in the correct order, and lists the correct task names as per the ground truth. The answer also refrains from providing any information about Processes A or C, as instructed. 

The only minor deviation is the presence of brief explanatory notes in parentheses after each set, which, while not strictly necessary per the prompt and the compact style of the ground truth, do not introduce incorrect content. However, the instructions suggest utmost strictness, and the inclusion of explanatory text rather than only the bare list as in the ground truth warrants a notable, if modest, deduction.

Therefore, the answer earns a 9.0.
