7.0

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of response):
- **Strengths (high marks basis)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst based on joint SLA breaches (throughput excesses: +300s, +300s, +60s – precise matches) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s – all explicitly stated). Quantifications are accurate and data-grounded without invention. Uses bullets exclusively for recommendations. Memo length ≈150 words. No forbidden inventions of activities/metrics. Structure is executive memo format.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions under strictness)**: Recommendations are data-referenced but generic/vague ("allocate resources", "optimize workflows", "enhance data inputs") vs. GT's highly concrete, specific actions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks", "add one risk analyst", "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k") – major content difference in ~1/3 of memo. No total cases mention (GT: "4 805"). Different header (From, Subject). Paragraph-style activity details vs. GT's bolded list format. Extra intro sentence before rec bullets. No projection/impact estimate. Phrasing/style variances accumulate under "utmost strictness/small errors = big loss". Net: Strong factual core (8-9 range) pulled down by recs/structure diffs to 7.0.
