The LLM answer proposes an entirely different modification (changing "Task_SignContract" dueDate from P3D to P1D) than the ground truth (changing "Task_CollectEquipment" dueDate from P5D to P2D), with mismatched rationale focused on digital signing bottlenecks instead of fitting a 3-day SLA, rendering it non-compliant with the expected solution and warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
