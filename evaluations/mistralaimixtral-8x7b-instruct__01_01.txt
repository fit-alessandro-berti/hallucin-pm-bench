**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% penalty)**: Ground truth identifies **exactly 3 precise decision points** with clear branching logic (eligibility pass/fail, amount threshold post-PreApprove, final approval/rejection). LLM incorrectly lists **5 "decision points"** that are mostly sequential *activities* (e.g., treats linear steps like Process_Refund_Payment and Issue_Confirmation_Letter as decisions). Misses explicit rejection outcomes (e.g., no "claim rejected" for eligibility or final step). Amount threshold is misplaced (under PreApprove, not "after"). No table or structured summary matching ground truth format/logic. Significant invention of structure.
  
- **Required Documents (Major Errors, ~25% penalty)**: Ground truth provides **one complete, numbered list of all 7 documents** (with AuditTrail caveat). LLM scatters docs *cumulatively per point* (repetitive, incomplete per section, e.g., point 5 lists only 1 doc). No single comprehensive list. All defined docs mentioned but not catalogued cleanly/accurately as required.

- **Fidelity to Prompt/Process (Moderate Errors, ~10% penalty)**: Adds unrequested activity descriptions (e.g., full steps under each "point"). Introduces chit-chat ("Sure, I'd be happy to help!", "I hope this helps!") violating concise summary. No undefined activities/artefacts introduced (minor positive).

- **Overall Structure & Precision (Minor Errors, ~5% penalty)**: Verbose, non-tabular, non-matching format. Small issues (e.g., phrasing like "Decision Point 1: Triage Agent Validates Eligibility" conflates steps) compound.

Total: Poor match (~20% alignment); strict deduction for all mismatches yields 2.0. Perfect would be 10.0 (exact replication).
