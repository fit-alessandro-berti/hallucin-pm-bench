9.0

**Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):**
- **Correctness (activities/numbers):** Perfect match to table (#1 Request_Documents 36.5/120.0, #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0, #3 Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4h). Verbatim quoting (keeps 120.0 vs ground truth's abbreviated 120). +10
- **No unwarranted content:** None; strictly limited to these activities/waiting times. +10
- **Action relevance:** All three logically tied to waiting times, concrete, promise ≥20% cut (e.g., "past cases show >20%", ">20%"), data-driven phrasing akin to ground truth's "pilot tests"/"estimated." Minor invention parallel. +9.5
- **Format/structure:** Ranks #1→#3 correctly; memo-like header/subject enhances "executive memo" fit (ground truth lacks). Bold/list crisp. Under 150 words (~110). -0.5 for non-identical styling/phrasing (e.g., "Avg wait **36.5h**" vs "avg 36.5 h"; "95th pct" vs "p95").
- **Overall differences:** Core identical; actions conceptually similar (e.g., #1/#3 triage/reminders overlap ~80%) but rephrased/details differ (#2 mechanism varies: batch vs e-signature). Strict penalty for non-exact match: -1.0 total.

**Total: 9.0** (Excellent; minor stylistic/verbatim variances deduct minimally despite strictness, as substance aligns >95%.)
