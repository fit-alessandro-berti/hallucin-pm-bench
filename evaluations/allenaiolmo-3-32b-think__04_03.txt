The LLM answer is fully correct, complete, and directly matches the ground truth in substance: correct "No" verdict, accurate assessment of all four rules (violation only in Rule 3, with precise reasoning tied to the trace order), and a short justification referencing each rule as required by the prompt. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., no table format, step numbering, phrasing on "both" in Rule 3) are cosmetic and do not alter correctness or completeness under strict evaluation.
