**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a)**: Major errors. Identifies only **2/2** actual decision points correctly (the risk-based skip and TriVote), but **adds an extraneous third** (Tri-Color-Risk-Check), misclassifying a data-production step as a "decision point (gate or conditional branch)." Ground truth explicitly treats the skip as the sole post-Tri-Color decision; this inflation and mischaracterization is a significant deviation (-4.0 points). Minor wording diffs (e.g., "€250,000 or less" vs. "≤ €250 000"; "approve" vs. "record 'Approve'") incur further strict penalty (-1.0).
- **Part (b)**: Severe omissions and incompleteness. Lists only **5/9** documents, **entirely missing** the 3 Scorecards (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow, first-appearing in step 3 as explicit "Inputs" documents; critical error as they precede Deck Memo) and **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (distinct from unsigned Offer Sheet 77 per steps 7-8). Order is partially correct for listed items but disrupted by misses. Adds unrequested descriptions (minor formatting/style deviation). No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC), but incompleteness warrants heavy deduction (-5.0+).
- **Overall**: ~40% alignment (core rules partially captured but structurally flawed/missing elements); strict policy demands substantial loss for these inaccuracies/omissions.
