### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: Partial credit (incomplete). The LLM correctly identifies the two added tasks by ID (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), which align with the XML elements present only in v2. However, it fails to use the full element details as they appear (e.g., the `name` attributes "Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code"), listing only IDs without context. The ground truth explicitly includes names with IDs for clarity and fidelity to XML content. This is a significant deviation under strict evaluation, as the prompt requires factual XML-readable differences without speculation, and names are directly in the XML. Format uses simple dashes instead of structured bullets, but headings match.
  
- **Removed tasks**: Major error (no credit). The LLM incorrectly states "(none)", overlooking the clear removal of `<task id="send_rma_label" name="Send RMA Label"/>` from v1 (present after `approve_return` with flow `f5` to `end`) to v2 (replaced by `generate_qr` with flow `f6` to `generate_qr` then `f7` to `end`). This is a factual, directly readable difference in the XML snippets, and missing it violates the core instruction to list *only* factual differences without omission. Ground truth correctly identifies it with name and ID.

- **Gateway type changes**: Strong match (full credit). The LLM accurately notes the change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` (v1) to `inclusiveGateway` (v2), using the exact element types and ID from the XML. Minor phrasing difference (arrow notation vs. explicit "from...to" with versions) is negligible, as it conveys the same fact without speculation.

**Overall**: With utmost strictness, the complete miss on removed tasks (a core category) and incomplete details on added tasks result in substantial point loss (-6.0 total from 10.0 baseline). The gateway section saves partial value, but small errors (e.g., missing names/IDs in added) compound the deduction as instructed. No other differences (e.g., sequence flows, ID renumbering like f3/f4 shifts) are reported by either, aligning with the prompt's focus. Total reflects ~40% accuracy in capturing all required factual changes.
