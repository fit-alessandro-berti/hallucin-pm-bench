**4.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Top 3 correctly identified/ranked by 95p waiting time (#1 Request_Documents: 36.5/120.0; #2 Send_Closure_Letter: 12.2/44.0; #3 Assess_Liability: 7.8/16.4). Numbers quoted accurately (minor .2f formatting diff, but verbatim match). +3.0 pts.
- **Format/Structure**: Fails entirely—not a "crisp executive memo" (≤150 words, prose). Instead, verbose Python code blocks with prints, extraneous sorting of *all* activities, gibberish snippets (e.g., "Top_3_Worst_Performing_Activities", pandas on nonexistent CSV), and generic "Measurement Improvement Plan". Ranking as "S.No" not "#1→#3". No memo structure. -4.0 pts base, partial credit for printed section. Net: +1.0 pt.
- **No Unwarranted Content**: Lists all activities in code (violates "only these three"). No service/throughput mentioned. Minor ding. +0.5 pt.
- **Actions**: One per activity, waiting-time tied (e.g., automation for docs), but not "concrete, data-driven" (generic "review/streamline" vs. ground truth's "pilot tests show ≥25%"; no specific ≥20% evidence/estimates per action—generic footer only). Weak relevance. +0.2 pt.
- **Overall Strictness**: Major format failure dominates; small errors (e.g., output style, action specificity) compound. Ground truth is clean, precise memo excerpt—LLM is unusable code dump.
