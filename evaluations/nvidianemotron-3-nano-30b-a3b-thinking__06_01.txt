The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"), in correct alphabetical order both within pairs (C before Q, P before S) and overall list (C-pair before P-pair). No extra or missing pairs, fully ignores Process A, matches the semantic ground truth perfectly.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for small formatting discrepancies under utmost strictness:
- Lacks precise spacing/alignment around "—" matching the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` and ground truth (e.g., consistent padding spaces before/after em dash, columnar alignment on second line via extra spaces after "Procure_Materials").
- No enclosing code block (```), as in ground truth presentation.

Content is flawless; formatting is near-exact (one pair per line, em dashes used).
