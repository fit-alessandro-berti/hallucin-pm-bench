- The LLM answer correctly identifies all three required elements: 3 distinct cases, "Pack_Items" as the preceding activity for C456's "Ship_Order", and "Cancel_Order" as the unique activity (appearing once).  
- Minor deduction for Q1: The response provides only the number "3" instead of specifying "3 cases" with the explicit list (C123, C456, C789) as in the ground truth, which introduces a small but notable formatting/content difference under strict evaluation criteria. All other aspects match precisely in content and conciseness.
