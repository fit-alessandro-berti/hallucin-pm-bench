- The LLM answer provides the correct information to all three questions.
    - Q1: LLM says "3", while the ground truth writes out "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)". The value is correct, but the LLM omits the explicit list of case IDs, which is a small (but very minor, since prompt did not ask for listing them) omission of detail.
    - Q2: LLM matches the expected answer exactly ("Pack_Items").
    - Q3: LLM matches the expected answer exactly ("Cancel_Order").

Deducting 1 point for not being explicit as in ground truth for Q1, as strictness is requested. Otherwise, all substantive content is correct and not misleading.
