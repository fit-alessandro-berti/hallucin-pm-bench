**7.3**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment) as ground truth, with throughput drop noted accurately for Request_Documents. Memo format is executive-appropriate, concise (~140 words <200), structured as list with explanations and one action per activity. Actions are concrete and loosely data-driven (e.g., rework → automation; stdev → standardization).
- **Major deductions (-1.5 total)**:
  - **Factual error**: Claims Initial_Assessment has "second-highest SLA breach (3.2%)" – strictly false per table (Review_Documents 12.4%, *Request_Documents 5.5%*, Initial_Assessment 3.2%; it's third). Small but clear misread of data = significant penalty per instructions.
  - **Incomplete explanations** (-0.8): Review_Documents omits key table metrics emphasized in ground truth (longest processing 25 min, 30 min wait); relies only on SLA/stdev. Initial_Assessment explanation vaguer ("early capacity constraints compared to other activities") vs. ground truth's upstream congestion tie-in.
- **Minor deductions (-1.2 total)**:
  - Actions less precise/quantifiable than ground truth (e.g., LLM: "reduce manual follow-ups" vs. GT: "cut queueing and halve rework"; no "measurable improvement" as GT note specifies).
  - Speculative projection ("recovery... to 270+ cases/day") not in ground truth and not clearly data-derived (ignores multi-drop throughput).
  - Missing bolding/emphasis on key figures; less comprehensive metric coverage overall.
- **No worse performers hallucinated**; stays within table. Overall ~75% alignment, downgraded strictly for differences/errors.
