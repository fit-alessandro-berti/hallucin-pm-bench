The LLM’s answer contains all the correct differences, fully capturing every change required by the prompt—no missing items or extras. However, it does not follow the prescribed output format strictly:

- The answer uses hyphens ("-") as bullet points for the section titles instead of rendering them as plain section headings as in the ground truth.
- The answer indents task entries with an additional two spaces, and gateway changes with an extra space; the ground truth uses consistent, no-indentation formatting.
- There is misalignment in the gateway change for “Gateway_Payment”. The ground truth uses padding (“Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel”) while the answer uses (“Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel”); although this is a superficial formatting difference, the prompt specifically requires output fidelity.
- The ground truth writes the three section headings without punctuation after them, while the LLM answer puts colons after each heading.

Given the explicit instruction for strictness, these formatting issues are significant and warrant a substantial deduction, despite the factual accuracy.
