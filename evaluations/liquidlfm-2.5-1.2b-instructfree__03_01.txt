**1.0**

The LLM answer is invalid BPMN 2.0 XML and fails every core requirement:
- **Malformed structure**: No `xmlns`, no `<process>`, no standard BPMN elements (e.g., `<task>`, `<exclusiveGateway>`, `<sequenceFlow>`). Uses invalid tags like `<t1>`, `<gw1>`, `<id>` outside attributes.
- **No process flow**: Absent `<startEvent>`, `<endEvent>`, or any `<sequenceFlow>`s—impossible to model the described sequence, gateways, or loop.
- **Invented/missing elements**: Adds non-mentioned activities ("Support Ticket Created", "Resolve & Close"), wrong gateways (e.g., "Initial Classification Decision" as task?), no rework loop (f13 missing). Descriptions hallucinate details (e.g., "Agency decides").
- **Violates constraints**: >40 lines if cleaned; not concise IDs in proper context; gateways not exclusive or positioned correctly.
- **0% fidelity to ground truth**: No matching topology, conditions (e.g., `yes`/`no`), or exact task names/ordering.

This is non-functional gibberish, not BPMN.
