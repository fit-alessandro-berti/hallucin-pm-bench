**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect match, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Activities match exactly.
- **Structure & Format (partial, +1.0)**: Basic RACI table present with correct rows/columns/roles. However, minor diffs (e.g., abbreviated role headers like "(AM)", centered alignment, **R/A** vs **R / A**, inconsistent bolding on GT-bolted activities).
- **RACI Content (major errors, -3.0)**: Substantial mismatches across **all 6 rows** (24 cells total; ~12-15 cells differ):
  | Row | Mismatches |
  |-----|------------|
  | Receive Application | CO: C → I; IT: I → - |
  | KYC Review | AM: A → I; CO: **R** → **R/A**; FC: C → -; IT: I → - |
  | Order Vetting | IT: I → - |
  | Payment Clearance | AM: A → I; CO: C → -; FC: **R** → **R/A** |
  | Record Update | CO: I → -; FC: C → I; IT: **R** → **R/A** |
  | Notify Customer | IT: I → C |
  - Violates GT rubric: Not all RACI allocations match narrative-derived GT (e.g., no exact one Responsible per row in same way; AM Accountable not preserved where GT has it separate).
- **Unwarranted Content (penalty, -2.0)**: Adds # title, Legend section, Activity Ownership Summary (GT has none); introduces self-description not requested.
- **Overall**: Core matrix intent captured but undermined by pervasive cell errors, notation diffs, and extras. Strict rubric demands near-identical match; small/pervasive diffs = major deduction. No self-awareness issue.
