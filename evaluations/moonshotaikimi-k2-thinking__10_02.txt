### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit basis):** The LLM answer uses Markdown for a RACI table (+0.5). It correctly applies mandated vocabulary: "KYC Review" in task 3, "Transaction Analyst" for clerk-related tasks, "Regulatory Liaison" for compliance tasks (+1.0). It covers core tasks from the informal description without omissions in intent (e.g., screening, approval, release, archive), though with a split/addition (+0.5). Basic RACI structure (R, A, C, I) is present without invalid entries (+1.0).
- **Major Errors (significant deductions):**
  - **Roles/Columns:** Missing "Operations Manager" column entirely, which is present in ground truth as a key accountable role across all tasks (-2.0). Only partial role mapping (TA, RL, IT Support), violating full coverage of RACI dynamics in ground truth.
  - **Tasks/Activities:** Incorrect breakdown—splits task 5 into separate "Release payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" (adds unneeded granularity, creates 7 tasks vs. ground truth's 6) (-1.5). Task 6/7 mishandles archiving (adds as 7th, no "Record" wording, misses consultation) (-0.5). Wordings differ (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record") (-1.0). No header emphasis on "mandated wording" or legend (-0.5).
  - **RACI Assignments:** Near-total mismatch across all tasks, failing to replicate ground truth logic (e.g., Receive: LLM TA R/A vs. ground TA R/OM A/IT C/RL I; Screen: LLM TA R/A/RL I vs. ground TA R/RL A/OM I/IT C; KYC: partial overlap on RL R/TA C but misses OM A/IT I; Approve: LLM TA I/RL R/A vs. ground TA C/RL R/OM A/IT I; Release: partial on TA R but misses OM A/IT C/RL I; extra SWIFT task has no ground truth equivalent; Archive: misses TA C/OM A, wrong on RL I/IT R/A) (-3.0). Bold formatting inconsistent (e.g., groups **R, A** vs. individual **R**/**A**).
- **Overall Strictness:** As a reference-based evaluation, even partial alignments (mandated terms) cannot offset structural, content, and assignment divergences. Ground truth emphasizes precise mapping, accountability distribution, and clarity (e.g., legend, headers), which LLM ignores. Cumulative errors indicate poor fidelity (~70% deviation), justifying low score. No criminal/offensive content issues.
