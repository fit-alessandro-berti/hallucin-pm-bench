The LLM answer is an excellent match to the ground truth: both correctly identify the impossibility of computation due to the redacted event log (headers only, no timestamps or rows), explain the precise reasons (lack of start/complete times for "Approve Invoice"), cover all required metrics (average, std dev, CI), and adhere to the one-short-paragraph format without guessing or extraneous details. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "unable to compute" vs. "Impossible"; no explicit mention of needing more entries in LLM) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as the core content, precision, and compliance are identical.
