9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Both correctly conclude the value **cannot be derived/computed** (core match to system policy and ground truth). Both emphasize missing timestamps/durations as the reason, preventing any calculation. LLM follows user query structure (1) and 2)) precisely, with clear, data-supported explanation.
- **Differences (point deductions under strictness)**: 
  - Phrasing: "cannot be derived" vs. ground truth's "cannot be computed" (-0.3); minor but strict loss for non-identical wording.
  - Explanation details: LLM adds benchmark irrelevance (accurate but extraneous to ground truth's focus) and general calc method; ground truth specifies "lacks ... ordering information" and "temporal value per event" + "fabricated" warning (LLM implies but doesn't state explicitly, -0.3).
  - Ground truth notes log contents explicitly ("only case-id, activity name and resource"); LLM references redaction but not contents list (-0.2).
- No factual errors or fabrication; substance ~95% identical, but strict diff-based grading docks for non-exact match.
