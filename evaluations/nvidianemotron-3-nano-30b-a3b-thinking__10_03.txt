**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly uses **exactly** the 4 mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no synonyms or leaks. Basic Markdown table structure with all 4 roles as columns. Some RACI partial matches (e.g., Compliance Analyst R/A for KYC/AML; Risk Scoring Comp R + Officer A + Treas I).
- **Major failures (severe deductions)**:
  - **Missing 2 entire rows** ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"): Fails "covering **every activity** described" (narrative explicitly includes escalation/approval, scheduling/release, notification). Ground truth covers 6 activities; LLM only 4 → ~33% coverage loss (-3.0).
  - **Incomplete/wrong RACI assignments** (per row comparisons, strict matching):
    | Activity | Key diffs from GT | Impact |
    |----------|-------------------|--------|
    | Intake Vetting | Front OK (R/A ≈ R,A); Comp I vs **C**; misses Treas **I**, Officer **–**; empties vs **–** | High inaccuracy (-1.0) |
    | KYC Review | Comp OK (R/A); misses Officer **C**, Treas **I** | Significant gaps (-1.0) |
    | AML Screening | Same as KYC | Significant gaps (-1.0) |
    | Risk Scoring | Misses Front **C**; OK otherwise | Minor gap (-0.5) |
  - **Formatting errors**: No **bold** on activities/R,A (GT standard); "R/A" vs "**R, A**"; empties/spaces vs **–** for no involvement → inconsistent/readability fail (-0.5).
- **Overall**: ~40% alignment (vocab/structure) but critical omissions/errors in completeness, accuracy, format justify low score. Strictness applied: each small cell/RACI mismatch = -0.5+; missing rows = outsized penalty.
