The LLM answer correctly identifies all three concurrent task sets from Process B with exact task names, order, and comma separation matching the ground truth. No extraneous tasks or processes are mentioned, and sequential tasks are excluded as required.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Adds an unnecessary introductory paragraph (2 lines, ~80 characters) not present in the ground truth or explicitly requested ("Return your answer as numbered lines").
- Applies bold markdown (** **) to the process title and all three list items, altering the plain-text format of the ground truth.
- Minor spacing/alignment differences due to bolding.

These format deviations and extra content represent small but clear differences from the ground truth's pure, unadorned numbered list, warranting a significant deduction from 10.0 despite perfect content accuracy.
