9.0

- Q1 matches core answer (3) but lacks "cases" phrasing and case list from ground truth (-0.5 for incomplete detail under strictness).
- Q2 matches exactly in substance, minor potential escaping difference ignored as rendering artifact (+3.25).
- Q3 matches exactly (+3.25).
- Format is concise bullet-points as prompted but differs slightly in labeling/style from ground truth (-0.5). Overall high due to factual accuracy.
