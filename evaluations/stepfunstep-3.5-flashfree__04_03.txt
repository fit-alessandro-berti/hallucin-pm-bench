9.5

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in correctness: correctly identifies "No" compliance, accurately assesses all four rules (satisfied: 1,2,4; violated: 3 due to NA before RA), and provides equivalent reasoning with precise rule references. Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic differences—bullet list vs. table format, slightly less emphatic "No" header (plain "No" vs. "**No – the trace is not compliant.**"), and marginally wordier phrasing in some bullets (e.g., "contravening the requirement that it must happen only after both QE and RA are finished" vs. concise "NA must wait until **both** QE and RA are finished")—which deviate from the ground truth's exact structure and brevity under strict evaluation. No factual errors.
