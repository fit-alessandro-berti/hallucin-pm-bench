8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both pairs and lists them in correct alphabetical order both within pairs and overall. However, it does not match the specified output format exactly: the "Procure_Materials  â€”  Schedule_Machines" line is misaligned compared to the ground truth, which uses extra whitespace between the task names and the dash for perfect alignment. While the difference is minor and the substantive information is correct, the instructions specify strict adherence to the output format as demonstrated in the example. According to your grading criteria ("small errors should reflect in significant loss of points") such a formatting inconsistency should result in a notable deduction, hence the 8.0 score.
