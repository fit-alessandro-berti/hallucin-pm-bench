The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth in content, pair identification, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall), and format (one pair per line with the specified structure). The minor visual alignment in the ground truth (extra spaces in the second pair for column-like presentation) is not a requirement of the prompt and does not constitute an error in the LLM's output.
