### Evaluation Rationale:
**Part 1 (exact count):** Perfect match (both correctly identify 1 occurrence, with matching case/timestamp details). No deduction.

**Part 2 (explanation):** Strong overlap on core ideas (tiny sample of 3 cases/short window; naming variants like “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)” risking under/over-counting). LLM word count ≈112 (≤120). However, strict deductions for:
- Missing precise data-derived details: 14 events, <2-hour span (09:02–10:45).
- No quantitative sampling volatility (e.g., 0%–7% frequency swing per event, wide confidence interval, extreme error for rare events)—key analytical strength of ground truth.
- Minor additions (e.g., "non-random," "atypical routing") are valid but dilute focus vs. ground truth's statistical precision.
- Does not repeat count in explanation or emphasize "randomly drawn" full log need.

Overall: High fidelity (80%+ alignment) but lacks ground truth's data-specific rigor and statistical depth, warranting deductions under utmost strictness.
