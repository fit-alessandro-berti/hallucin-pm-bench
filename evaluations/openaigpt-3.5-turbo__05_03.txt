**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core correctness (major deductions)**: Adds a boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` with correct `PT48H` duration and routes to existing `Activity_AMReview` (+partial credit), but timer starts *at CreateAccount start* (after gateway), not precisely "within 48 hours of finishing Verify Identity" as SLA specifies (-1.0). Fails to make it explicitly *interrupting* (`cancelActivity="true"` omitted, defaults uncertain).
- **BPMN validity & minimalism violations (heavy deductions)**: Introduces **invalid BPMN** by adding `Flow_09` from `Activity_VerifyID` to `Activity_CreateAccount` with `${VerificationComplete}`, bypassing `Gateway_VerifyOutcome` and creating multiple unmerged outgoing flows from `VerifyID` (-2.0). Adds irrelevant/unnecessary `<ioSpecification>`, data I/O elements, and standalone `<bpmn:timerEventDefinition id="TimerDef_01">` (unused XML fragment) (-1.5). Repeats full task element instead of *only* changed/added fragments (-0.5).
- **Justification**: Vaguely correct but omits "pre-existing" escalation path emphasis, adds inaccurate data-condition dependency not in ground truth (-0.5). Longer than "one-sentence".
- **Fidelity to ground truth**: High-level idea overlaps (~30% match), but structural differences (wrong flows, extras) make it non-equivalent and broken; not minimal or precise (-2.5 total differences impact).
- **Strictness adjustment**: No new activities respected, but errors compound to significantly flawed output vs. ground truth's clean, precise 2-element addition. Baseline 10 → 3.0 after deductions.
