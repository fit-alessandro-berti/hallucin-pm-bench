The LLM answer is semantically perfect and follows the prompt's instruction for concise bullet-point answers exactly. All three responses are correct:

- Q1: "3" precisely answers "how many distinct cases," matching the core fact in ground truth.
- Q2: "Pack_Items" exact match (underscore rendering minor).
- Q3: "Cancel_Order" exact match.

Deductions under utmost strictness for textual/format differences vs. ground truth:
- Q1 omits "cases (C123, C456, C789)" (lists verify distinctness).
- No **A1:**/**A2:**/**A3:** labels or bold/* bullets.
- No introductory "**Expected answer**".

These are small but result in ~10% loss for non-identical match.
