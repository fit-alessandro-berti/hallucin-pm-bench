**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (40% weight)**: Perfect match—correct count (1), cites exact case (1002). +4.0/4.0.
- **Q2 (60% weight)**: Concise (<120 words), identifies core issue (small sample of 3 cases/~2hrs, 1 occurrence, non-representative). However, significant omissions vs. ground truth: no quantification of frequency swing (0%-7% of events), no wide confidence interval or rare-event sampling error emphasis, **no mention of near-synonyms** ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing matching confusion (key data-driven misestimation risk). Adds mild speculation (spikes, profiles) despite "no speculation" rule. +3.2/6.0.

Overall: Strong but incomplete; misses data-specific nuances and stats rigor for full alignment.
