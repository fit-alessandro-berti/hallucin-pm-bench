10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth across all four questions: correct count (1), precise percentage (5.56%), accurate case identifier (A1002), and two valid sampling-related reasons (temporal bias via narrow time frame and small sample size via single instance), all derived solely from the provided log without hallucinations or inferences. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., spacing in percentage) are negligible under strict evaluation.
