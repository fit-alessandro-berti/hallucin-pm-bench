3.5

The LLM answer follows the required vocabulary mandate, consistently using the enforced terms (“KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”), and avoids forbidden synonyms. However, there are major issues compared to the ground truth:

**Major Errors and Omissions:**
- Completely omits the “Operations Manager” role, which is present in the ground truth as the Accountable (“A”) for every task. Instead, the LLM answer frequently assigns “A” to the same person as “R” (Responsible), which is rarely correct: “A” and “R” serve distinct purposes.
- Roles such as “Accountable” for key activities (e.g., KYC Review, approving high-risk transactions) should be “Operations Manager” strictly according to the ground truth, but the answer puts “Regulatory Liaison” or “Transaction Analyst” as both “R” and “A.”
- The structure of the table is inconsistent with the ground truth: The LLM splits roles into columns whereas the ground truth creates a cross-matrix for all mandated participants, marking proper R/A/C/I in each cell.
- The LLM answer uses task wording that's not consistently aligned with the precise ground-truth task wording (e.g., “Transmit SWIFT message” instead of “Archive Record”).
- Omits “Consulted” and “Informed” parties where the ground truth explicitly lists them, instead putting dashes or empty cells.
- Mishandles particular step responsibilities: For example, in “Screen payment against sanctions list,” LLM makes “Regulatory Liaison” Accountable when ground truth correctly has “Operations Manager” as Accountable.

**Minor Issues:**
- Small but strict adherence: Some task names slightly differ from ground truth; while not fatal, accuracy was mandated.

**Summary:**
- Heavily penalised (down to 3.5) for absence of defined roles (“Operations Manager”), incorrect RACI mapping, incomplete role consultation, and granularity mismatch, although vocabulary rules were followed well.
- Strictness is applied: these errors are non-trivial and reflect a misunderstanding of the difference between “Responsible” and “Accountable,” as well as incomplete table structure per the provided standard.

**If the roles were mapped and split correctly, and the table followed the ground truth structure, this would have scored much higher even if minor errors remained.**
