3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: The ground truth uses a standard RACI format with tasks in rows and roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) as columns, populating cells with R/A/C/I letters and bolding for emphasis. It includes a clear legend. The LLM answer inverts this by using R/A/C/I as columns and leaving most cells empty, which fails to distribute responsibilities across roles effectively and resembles a simplified assignment list rather than a true RACI matrix. This is a fundamental mismatch in presentation and clarity, violating the "organise the RACI matrix clearly" requirement.
  
- **Task Coverage and Wording (Moderate Deduction: -1.5 points)**: The LLM covers all source steps, including a separate "Transmit SWIFT message" task (accurate to step 5), but the ground truth omits this and combines it implicitly into "Release Payment," while rephrasing tasks more precisely (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. LLM's "Receive and log transfer instruction"; "**KYC Review**" bolded as mandated). LLM's task names are closer to raw source text but lack the "mandated wording" emphasis and polish. Small rephrasing errors accumulate strictly per instructions.

- **Role Usage and Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: LLM correctly uses only mandated terms (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst) and retains "IT Support" without forbidden synonyms. However, it omits the ground truth's "Operations Manager" (used for accountability) and makes overly simplistic assignments (e.g., R and A always the same role per task, minimal C/I usage). Ground truth distributes roles nuancedly (e.g., Operations Manager as A across tasks, adding C/I where implied). This results in incomplete RACI logic, ignoring potential consultations/informations from the source (e.g., no C for IT Support in screening/release).

- **Overall Fidelity and Extras (Minor Positive: +0.5 points offset in total)**: LLM maps source text without omissions or invalid terms, and includes notification in archiving (I for Regulatory Liaison, matching ground truth intent). No extraneous content, but lacks ground truth's bottom note on vocabulary adherence, reducing completeness.

Total reflects strict scoring: base 10.0 minus deductions for pervasive differences in format, nuance, and completeness, with even small wording/structure gaps penalized heavily. The LLM answer is functional but not a close match to the benchmark.
