8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (weight ~20%)**: Correct (1 occurrence). Minor wording ("1 time" vs. "1"), no deduction.
- **Q2a/b (weight ~30%)**: Exact match on numbers (2.08%, 8.33%) and calculations. Perfect.
- **Q3 (weight ~50%)**: Covers required elements—(i) single occurrence explicitly; (iii) cautions over-generalization ("may not generalize"); (ii) implies instability via "specific to a single case"—but lacks explicit statistical variance examples (e.g., skewing averages, noise, confidence intervals) as in GT sample. Factual error: claims "support < 1%" despite own 2a calc showing 2.08% (self-contradictory; -1.0). Under 100 words, on-topic. Strong but imperfect.

Overall: 95% alignment, downgraded for error and indirect (ii) (-1.5 total). Strict per instructions.
