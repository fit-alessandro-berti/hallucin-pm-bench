9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly answering **No** and justifying with precise citations to counterexample CaseIDs (C002, C004) including activity sequences and timestamps from the log, while noting compliance in C001/C003 to affirm the "always" violation. No factual errors. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking the explicit "**Answer:** No." phrasing and case-by-case table structure of ground truth (more concise bullet format instead); (2) inclusion of timestamps (accurate but extraneous to strict sequence focus). These format/content presentation differences prevent a perfect 10.0 under utmost strictness.
