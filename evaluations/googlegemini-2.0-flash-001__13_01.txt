**Score: 8.0**

**Evaluation and breakdown:**

**Q1:** “The activity ‘Manual_Fraud_Check’ occurs 1 time in this fragment.”  
- **Correct.**

**Q2:** “This represents 5.56% of all logged events.”  
- **Correct.** (Calculation: 1 ÷ 18 × 100 = 5.56%)

**Q3:** “A1002”  
- **Correct identifier, but answer omits the explicitly requested phrasing (‘case identifier(s)’) and does not specify "only" or list as "case(s)". Minor deduction for lack of clarity/explicitness, as seen in the ground truth ("Only case A1002 contains...").**

**Q4:**  
- “Small Sample Size: The fragment contains only a few cases, which may not be representative of the entire population of cases.”  
- “Short Timeframe: The fragment covers only one day, which may not be representative of the entire month.”  
Both reasons are broadly correct, but the "Short Timeframe" answer is less precise than the ground truth’s "morning of 1 May 2025," missing the point that it may not even cover a whole day, much less the month—so it could be more precise. The secondary biases (case-mix, survivorship) are not mentioned, though only two are required.

**Deductions:**  
- **Q3:** Not using the explicit or comprehensive phrasing requested (e.g., “case identifier(s)” and “only”)—minor but relevant for strict grading.  
- **Q4:** Sampling issues not explained with maximum precision (e.g., does not mention just “morning,” nor addresses other possible biases), although two major points are covered.

**No major hallucinations or inaccuracies. All answers are factually anchored in the data, and calculations are correct. However, minor style/precision issues prevent a perfect score.**

**Final Score: 8.0**
