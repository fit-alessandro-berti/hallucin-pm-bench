### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (answering "Yes") and provides a valid, concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, with accurate marking updates and a brief justification tied to the inhibitor arc (p4=0 enabling T5). This directly addresses the prompt's requirements without errors in the sequence or basic logic.

However, under utmost strictness:
- It omits the deeper insight from the ground truth: T5 *must* fire before T3 (if T5 occurs at all) due to the permanent disablement of T5 after T3 (via the inhibitor arc and p4's behavior). The LLM's justification is minimal and doesn't explain this irrevocability or the full enabling condition (`p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0`), missing ~30% of the ground truth's explanatory depth.
- The sequence is shorter and doesn't extend to show T3 firing afterward (as in ground truth), which, while not strictly required, reinforces the "before" ordering more completely.
- Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "precede T3 in some reachable marking" vs. ground truth's sequence-focused proof) introduce slight imprecision, though not incorrect.

These differences in completeness and thoroughness warrant a deduction from a perfect score, but the core correctness keeps it high.
