The LLM answer provides two sets of concurrently executable tasks corresponding exactly to the two parallel blocks in Process B, using the correct task names and correct order. However, it omits explicit labeling ("Set 1", "Set 2", mention of "first/second parallel block") and the clarifying note "No other tasks...". Although the core content is fully correct, these small omissions constitute minor errors and thus a small loss of points.
