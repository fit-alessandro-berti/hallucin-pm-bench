The LLM answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, matching the ground truth in content (though lacking the bullet formatting, a minor deviation from the ground truth's style but aligned with the prompt's unspecified list format). However, it omits the second gateway type change (Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel), which is a verifiable and significant functional difference present in the XML snippets. This incompleteness in the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section warrants a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria, as it fails to cover all required differences despite the prompt's emphasis on summarizing *all* functional changes.
