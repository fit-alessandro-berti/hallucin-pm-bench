6.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all the added and removed tasks, as well as the gateway type change for `Gateway_ReviewNeeded`. However, it completely omits the required change for `Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel` under "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES," despite this being a verifiable difference from the XML snippets.

Additionally, the format does not use bullet points as shown in the ground truth (though this is less impactful than the content error). Still, the main and most significant error is the missing gateway type change.

Strictly, this major omission results in a significant loss of points from a perfect score, warranting a 6.0.
