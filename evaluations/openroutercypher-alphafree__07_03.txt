7.0

**Justification:**

- **ADDED TASKS:**  
  - LLM answer uses an inconsistent and incorrect format compared to the instructions: it prepends "ServiceTask:" or "SendTask:" and encloses IDs with backticks, while the ground truth omits task type labels and uses dashes. The prompt demands the format `id (name)` only. This deviation is a concrete error.
  - Task order is fine and all tasks correctly identified.

- **REMOVED TASKS:**  
  - Same formatting errors as above: wrong prefix ("UserTask:"), backticks on IDs, and inconsistent with the prompt's strict requirements.

- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES:**  
  - Correct identification of changes.
  - Formatting is partially correct (uses correct arrow notation), but the prompt requires a dash prefix and alignment (see ground truth), which is missing. Backticks used unnecessarily.

**Summary:**  
All semantic differences are correctly found, but the format deviates notably from the prompt and ground truth. These formatting errors warrant a strict deduction (at least 1-1.5 points for headings, 1-1.5 for repeated per-line output formatting errors), resulting in a 7.0/10.0.
