6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer; removed: Task_ManualReview; gateway changes: both to parallel), matching the ground truth content exactly. However, under strict evaluation criteria, several formatting and content deviations result in deductions:

- **Extra information**: Includes task types (e.g., "ServiceTask:", "UserTask:", "SendTask:") in ADDED and REMOVED sections, which are verifiable but not requested by the prompt (specifies only "id followed by the name in parentheses"). This violates "list only verifiable differences" and adds unneeded details, leading to a -1.5 point deduction.
- **Formatting inconsistencies**:
  - Uses backticks around all IDs (e.g., `Task_FraudCheck`), while ground truth omits them (-0.5).
  - Lacks bullet points ("- ") used in ground truth for all items (-0.5).
  - No alignment or spacing in GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES (ground truth aligns the second entry with spaces) (-0.5).
  - Added "REMOVED TASKS" has inconsistent capitalization and structure compared to headings (-0.3).
- **Minor structural issues**: Items are listed as plain lines under headings without the dashed bullet style, making it less precise to ground truth (-0.2).

These are small but cumulative errors in a highly prescriptive prompt requiring verbatim headings and exact output structure. Content accuracy prevents a lower score, but strictness demands significant penalties for deviations.
