6.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies that the trace is **not compliant**, referencing the appropriate rules and giving brief justifications.
- However, there is a significant error: **Rule 1 has been incorrectly marked as "Violated."** In the trace, QE occurs *before* RA, which is the required order, and each only occurs once, so this rule is satisfied. This is a substantial mistake.
- For Rule 2, the LLM gives the correct outcome (Satisfied) and the correct reasoning.
- For Rule 3, the LLM correctly points out the violation and why.
- For Rule 4, the LLM marks it as satisfied and gives a correct rationale.

**Strict deduction rationale:**
- Incorrect assessment of Rule 1 (marking as Violated instead of Satisfied) is a serious error (approx. -2.0).
- The answer format is acceptable (brief bulleted structure).
- All other rules are assessed correctly, but confusion from the Rule 1 error could mislead stakeholders (-1.0 more).
- The main conclusion ("No") is correct.

**Net score: 6.0** (Major deduction for Rule 1 error, otherwise good structure and analysis.)
