3.0

The LLM answer captures the overall structure with three exclusive gateways (despite the prompt mentioning two decision points), most tasks, the specialist path, and the loop back to Initial Diagnosis, but it contains significant errors that deviate from the exact description and ground truth:

- **Critical flow error**: After "Provide Reset Instructions" (t2), the LLM incorrectly routes to "Resolve Issue" (t3) instead of directly to "Confirm with Customer" (t6), adding an unmentioned step for the password reset path (lines 3 and 7 imply direct resolution via instructions, skipping general diagnosis/resolve). This fabricates a path not in the description, violating "do not invent or add activities."
- **Invalid condition expressions**: Uses plain `<conditionExpression>` without `xsi:type="tFormalExpression"`, incorrect labels (e.g., "Password Reset", "Resolve Issue" instead of "yes"/"no"), and inappropriate text for branches (e.g., task names as conditions for gw2). Ground truth uses proper formal expressions with yes/no.
- **Missing element attributes**: No names on start event ("Ticket Submitted"), end event ("Ticket Closed"), gateways (e.g., "Password Reset?", "Customer Confirms?"), or process. Task t1 is "Classify Ticket" instead of "Auto-Classification" (omitting "automatically" from line 2).
- **Minor omissions**: No XML declaration, targetNamespace, or process attributes (id/name/isExecutable). While not explicitly required, these align with ground truth's standard BPMN XML.

These differences, especially the invented flow and improper conditions, represent major hallucinations and non-exact translation, warranting a low score under strict criteria. The output is concise (<40 lines) and uses simple IDs, providing minimal credit.
