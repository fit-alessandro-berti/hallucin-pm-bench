The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring Process A as required), lists them in alphabetical order both within pairs (Create_Documentation before Quality_Check; Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines) and overall (C-Q pair before P-S pair), and uses the specified format of one pair per line with "—". No extraneous pairs or content are included. The only minor discrepancy is exact whitespace alignment: the ground truth uses additional spaces in the second line ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines") for visual alignment of the em dashes, while the LLM uses consistent but unaligned spacing (likely two spaces after the task name in both lines, matching the prompt's example format). This is a trivial formatting nitpick but warrants a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria. The provided rationale in the ground truth is not required by the prompt and does not factor into scoring the output list itself.
