**4.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria)
- **Decision Points (major errors, ~60% weight)**: 2.0/10. LLM incorrectly identifies **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** and **Dual Underwriter Split** as decision points (they are linear steps: verification and score assignment, not branches). Ground truth lists *only* true decision branches (3 total): Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA). LLM adds 2 extraneous points (total 5 vs. 3), omits sequential context (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), and lacks precise phrasing (e.g., "**Approve** or **Reject**" capitalization). These are not minor—core misinterpretation of "decision points" (if/else gates).
- **Required Documents (~30% weight)**: 8.5/10. Complete list matches exactly (all 6 items verbatim from process). Minor deductions for: no explanatory note "(No credit bureau...)", slight phrasing diffs tolerated but strictness applied (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "CIS template" vs. "CIS").
- **Structure/Formatting (~5% weight)**: 7.0/10. Uses exact activity names (good), no standard terminology introduced (good), but mismatched headers/numbering/style vs. ground truth (####, italics for conditions).
- **Overall Fidelity (~5% weight)**: 4.0/10. Prompt requires *exact terminology/flow*; LLM deviates significantly on core "decision points" summary, inflating list with non-decisions.

Total weighted: Significant point loss for fundamental errors in identifying/summarizing decisions, despite strong documents section.
