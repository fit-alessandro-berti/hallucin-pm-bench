8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall (captures all 3 decision points accurately using exact activity names, lists all 6 required documents without omissions or additions, follows process flow precisely, avoids disallowed credit/loan terms except one slip). However, under utmost strictness:

**Major deductions (-1.5 total):**
- Introduces "requested principal" and "€15,000 ceiling" – violates "do **not** introduce standard loan terminology" (uses process-exact "amount" instead).
- Minor formatting/structural diffs (bold vs ####, bullets vs numbered lists; verbose headers).

**Minor deductions (-0.5 total):**
- Phrasing diffs in decision points vs. GT's concise "*If... ⇒ ...*" style (e.g., LLM more explanatory: "compares... produced by... proceeds to NFC... moves toward Disburse Funds"; adds redundant "(amounts ≥ €15,000)"; omits "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
- Document phrasing not identical (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"; lacks GT's extra disclaimer note).

No factual errors or missing content, but cumulative small diffs warrant ~20% loss from 10.0.
