The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and core format (one pair per line with the specified structure). The minor whitespace differences (alignment on the second line) do not constitute an error under the prompt's instructions, which do not require visual alignment. No other discrepancies exist.
