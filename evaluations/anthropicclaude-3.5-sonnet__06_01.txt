8.5

The LLM answer is almost entirely correct: it lists both correct pairs, uses the right format, and puts the task names in alphabetical order within each pair. However, it does not align the pairs vertically using spaces (so that both column names line up), which is a minor but notable formatting errorâ€”especially as the ground truth displays this formatting explicitly. Given the instructions demand highest strictness and that "Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," a 1.5 point penalty is appropriate for this relatively minor formatting flaw. The substance and logic are flawless, but attention to exact output format reduces the score.
