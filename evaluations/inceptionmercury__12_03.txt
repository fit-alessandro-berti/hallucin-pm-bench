The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate (No) and provides a valid counterexample from Case C004, accurately describing the intervening activity (Check_Fraud). This suffices to disprove the "always" claim. However, under strict evaluation, it incurs significant point loss for incompleteness: it fails to cite all relevant CaseIDs (plural, as required), omitting the violation in C002 where Pack_Items intervenes between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment. The ground truth's case-by-case analysis (including a table) demonstrates full log scrutiny, which the LLM answer lacks, representing a notable difference in thoroughness despite the core correctness. Minor formatting differences (no table or explicit "always" refutation summary) further deduct points for not mirroring the ground truth's structure and detail.
