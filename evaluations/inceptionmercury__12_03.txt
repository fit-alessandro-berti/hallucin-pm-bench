The LLM correctly answers "No" and gives a relevant justification, explicitly citing CaseID C004 as a counterexample, including the specific sequence with "Check_Fraud" occurring between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment." This directly invalidates the FACT.

However, the answer is incomplete in its analysis:

- It only cites one (C004) of the two relevant counterexamples. C002 also violates the rule (with "Pack_Items" between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment"), but is not mentioned at all. This is a significant omission, as strictness requires all violations to be cited.
- There is no systematic or case-by-case analysis of all four cases; the answer gives the minimum evidence without exhausting all possibilities.
- The answer does not affirm the cases where the FACT would hold (C001 and C003), nor does it provide a table or similarly thorough structure for transparency, as the ground truth does.

Overall, the answer is correct but lacks completeness and detail, resulting in a loss of three points.
