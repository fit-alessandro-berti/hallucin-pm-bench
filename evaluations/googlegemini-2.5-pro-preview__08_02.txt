The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth, both in verdict and reasoning. It answers "Yes" to Q1 (correct). For Q2, the minimal firing sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] is correct and matches the ground truth both in content and order. The explanation succinctly details markings and token movement, aligning with the expected reasoning.

Minor issues that warrant a deduction:
- The explanation for why T3 cannot fire after T5 could be phrased more clearly. The last sentence ("T3 did not fire before T5 because T5 consumed the token from P2 which T3 also required.") is correct but lacks the explicit statement in the ground truth that T3 is now disabled after T5.
- The answer does not note that "T3 is subsequently disabled," as explicitly stated in the ground truth.
- The explanation, though accurate, is slightly less formal than the ground truth.

Otherwise, technically, the LLM answer is solid and not missing in terms of logical correctness. The issues are mainly in depth and explicitness of explanation, resulting in the loss of 2 points.
