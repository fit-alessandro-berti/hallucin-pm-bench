The LLM answer is almost correct: it lists both correct pairs, spells the tasks correctly, and uses the right format per instructions. However, there is a small formatting issue: the required answer aligns both task names in each pair by whitespace, as seen in the ground truth (second pair has spaces to align with the first). The LLM omitted this detail, resulting in a non-aligned output:

- LLM:  
  Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check  
  Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

- Ground Truth:  
  Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check  
  Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines

Since the prompt stresses strictness and penalizes small errors, this formatting mismatch warrants a deduction. Otherwise, the answer is conceptually and content-wise perfect.
