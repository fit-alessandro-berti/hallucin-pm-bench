The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel: (Create_Documentation, Quality_Check) and (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines). These are listed in the required alphabetical order (within pairs and overall), one per line, and in the specified format (`Task_X  â€”  Task_Y` with appropriate spacing around the em dash). No extraneous pairs are included, and the content precisely matches the ground truth, including no reference to Process A. The minor visual alignment (extra leading spaces on the second line in the ground truth) is not required by the prompt's instructions and does not constitute an error.
