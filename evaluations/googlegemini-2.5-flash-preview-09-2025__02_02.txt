10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content and factual precision across all questions: Q1 is correctly 3; Q2 provides the precise sequence; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically on separate lines with no extras, omissions, or errors. Explanatory text is accurate and supportive, not hallucinatory. Minor formatting differences (e.g., absence of ground truth's dashes) do not deviate from the prompt's requirements.
