The LLM answer is an exact match in substance to the ground truth across all four questions, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log, or factual errors. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., adding the case in Q1 or full sentences in Q4 explanations) do not constitute deviations, as they align precisely with the required content and intent. The two reasons in Q4 are directly from the acceptable list (small sample size and temporal bias), stated clearly and derived solely from the fragment's scope.
