7.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
**Part a) Decision Points (8.5/10):**  
- Both decision points identified correctly (risk-skip and TriVote).  
- Phrasing nearly identical: conditions ("Low or Medium **AND** ≤ €250 000"), skip to gate, and "at least two of three" approvers match closely.  
- Minor deductions: (1) LLM omits explicit "otherwise proceeds to Manual-Underwriting-Review" clause (ground truth includes both branches for completeness); (2) "either" in approvers list is awkward/unnecessary; (3) step references and bolding differ slightly from ground truth format.

**Part b) Documents List (6.5/10):**  
- Lists 8/9 items correctly, in mostly proper first-appearance order (Form 14B → Scorecards → Deck Memo → Offer Sheet 77 → Loan Dossier 2025).  
- **Major error (significant deduction):** Omits **Signed Offer Sheet 77** entirely (ground truth lists it as distinct #7, first appearing in Step 8 after unsigned Offer Sheet 77 in #6). This violates " **all** documents" and disrupts order (LLM jumps ID Matrix Declaration to #7, treating Step 8 incompletely).  
- Minor: Step parentheticals absent in ground truth; comma in "€250,000" (prompt uses space).  
- No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML).

**Overall (weighted average, strict):** 7.5/10. Excellent structure/content match (~90% alignment), but missing document + incomplete branch description = notable flaws under "utmost strictness" (deduct ~2.5 total points; small omissions scaled heavily).
