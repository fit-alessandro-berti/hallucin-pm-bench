**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Mandate Violation (Critical Failure, -4.0 points):** LLM uses forbidden terms throughout ("Clerk", "Compliance Officer", "Manager"). Does not use mandated "Transaction Analyst" or "Regulatory Liaison" *at all*. Only partially uses "**KYC Review**" once; ignores mandate to use *only* these in every output for activities/roles. Ground truth enforces exactly.
- **Task Mapping Errors (-2.0 points):** 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6; splits/invents tasks (e.g., "Log..."/"Screen..." separate from "Receive"; adds "Notify compliance officer" as separate). Descriptions deviate (e.g., "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" omits release; no "Receive"). Ground truth precisely maps source's 6 steps with mandated wording.
- **RACI Assignments Completely Incorrect (-2.0 points):** No match to ground truth (e.g., LLM: Clerk R for logging/screening/release; ground truth: Transaction Analyst R for receive/screen/release). Fabricates "Manager" as universal A. Ignores proper R/A/C/I distribution.
- **Structure/Extras (-1.0 points):** Wrong column headers/roles ("Activity / Task", lists wrong roles). Adds unauthorized "Notes" section repeating violations. No legend. Ground truth is clean, precise Markdown with legend.
- **Overall Fidelity (0.0 bonus):** No alignment to ground truth's enforced mapping, coverage, or clarity. Total differences warrant minimum score under "utmost strictness" – even minor term errors deduct heavily; this is wholesale non-compliance.
