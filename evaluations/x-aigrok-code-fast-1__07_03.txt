The LLM answer correctly identifies all the verifiable functional changes (added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway type changes) matching the ground truth content. However, it severely violates the prompt's strict output requirements by including extensive extraneous material: repetitive sections labeled "(collected)", "(COMBINED)", "(RESULT)", and "(composed)", empty listings for BPMN_v1, and multiple redundant reproductions of the output. This adds unauthorized commentary and structure, failing the mandate to "output must contain only the three required headings and the concrete differences." Additionally, the primary listing lacks the bullet points (-) used in the ground truth for consistency, and formatting (e.g., spacing after colons) is inconsistent. Under utmost strictness, these format and extraneous content issues constitute major deviations, warranting a low score despite factual accuracy.
