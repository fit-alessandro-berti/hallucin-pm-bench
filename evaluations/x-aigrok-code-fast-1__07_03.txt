The LLM answer contains all required, verifiable functional changes as specified in the ground truth, and does not include any spurious elements or commentary, which is good. However, the output departs noticeably from the required format and structure:

- The headings are repeated several times, including "collected", "BPMN_v1", "BPMN_v2", "(COMBINED)", "(RESULT)", and "(composed)" sections, which are not required by the prompt and add unnecessary clutter.
- The main list (although correct) is not formatted with dashes as bullets as in the ground truth (e.g., "- Task_FraudCheck...", etc.), making it less readable and not matching the requested structure.
- Headings are not consistently followed by list items with dashes, and sometimes the items are not indented or clearly grouped.
- There is some duplication (the functional content is accurate, but output is verbose and not concise as per instructions).

Despite enumerating all differences correctly and not guessing or commenting, these formatting and structure issues represent significant departures from strict compliance, leading to a substantial deduction.
