**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer fails on multiple critical dimensions with utmost strictness applied, resulting in a low score. Key failures:

#### 1. **Added/renamed activities (major violation)**:
   - Prompt: "do not rename, merge, or add activities." Must use **only authorized vocabulary** (4 terms) while covering described activities.
   - LLM adds "Approval (Compliance Officer)" and "Funds Release & Notification" — names differ from ground truth ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds").
   - Extra bold list of 4 terms above table is extraneous/unrequested.

#### 2. **RACI assignments severely inaccurate** (core output failure):
   | Activity                      | Key Mismatches (LLM vs. Ground Truth) |
   |-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
   | **Intake Vetting**           | Missing **A** (Front); blank ≠ **I** (Treasury) |
   | **KYC Review**               | Missing **A** (Comp Analyst); blank ≠ **I** (Treasury) |
   | **AML Screening**            | Wrong: Officer **R** (should be **C**); Treasury **C** (≠**I**); Comp Analyst blank (≠**R,A**) |
   | **Risk Scoring**             | Wrong: Treasury **R** (≠**I**); blanks ≠ **C/R/A** across roles |
   | **Approval**                 | Wrong names; partial **R** (Officer, missing **A**); Treasury **C** (≠–) |
   | **Funds Release**            | Wrong name (& Notification extra); blanks ≠ **I/C/C**; missing **A** (Treasury) |

   - Blanks used inconsistently (vs. ground truth **–** or explicit **I/C**).
   - No bolding for **R,A** as in ground truth.
   - Only ~20-30% partial cell matches; rest incorrect.

#### 3. **Extraneous/contradictory content**:
   - Unrequested **RACI Legend** and **Notes** section (prompt: "Return the matrix as a Markdown table").
   - Notes contradict table (e.g., "Risk Scoring executed by Compliance Analyst" but table assigns Treasury **R**; false claims like Front does **KYC Review**).
   - "This matrix ensures..." closing sentence unrequested.

#### 4. **Minor positives (insufficient to offset)**:
   - Correctly uses 4 authorized terms (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) without leaks/synonyms.
   - Markdown table structure basically sound.
   - Covers all roles.

**Overall**: Matrix is the required output; it's fundamentally broken (wrong activities, RACI, extras). Small errors (e.g., blanks, missing **A**) compound to major loss. Equivalent to ~20% fidelity to ground truth.
