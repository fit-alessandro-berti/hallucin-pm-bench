**6.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major mismatches, -2.5 pts)**: LLM correctly identifies eligibility check (#1 matches GT). However, it incorrectly embeds the amount threshold decision *within* **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** (error: branch occurs *after* PreApprove per process flow/GT #2). It splits final approval into separate Finance (#2) and Auditor (#3) decisions instead of combining as GT #3. Extraneous listings for non-decision activities (Payment/Letter as N/A) introduce unrequested content (+1 minor decision point overcount).
- **Outcomes/Logic (small errors, -0.8 pts)**: Adds unsubstantiated details (e.g., "audit standards," explicit "process ends" phrasing differs from GT's "rejected/returned" or "ends without payment"). Verbose vs. GT's concise table.
- **Documents (strong match, -0.0 pts)**: Lists all 7 exactly (matching GT), with AuditTrail condition noted similarly. Extra descriptions harmless but verbose.
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity (infidelity, -0.5 pts)**: No table; headings/numbered verbosity deviates from GT's clean format. No new activities/artefacts introduced, but infers beyond prompt's "summarise."
- **Base (perfect=10)**: Starts at 10, deducts for strict diff count (3 significant + 2 minor = 40% penalty equiv., capped).
