**10.0**

The LLM answer is a near-perfect match to the ground truth across all questions, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log, or factual errors. Strict evaluation:

- Q1: Exact match ("1").
- Q2: Exact match (5.56%, correct calculation shown; minor formatting difference in "%" spacing irrelevant).
- Q3: Exact match (A1002 only).
- Q4: Provides exactly two valid reasons from the ground truth list ("small sample size" with apt elaboration on size/cases/day; "temporal bias" with clear single-day limitation and variation examples). No extras or deviations.
