6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Factual Accuracy (High, but incomplete)**: The LLM correctly identifies all key changes—added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive. No extraneous or speculative content is added, aligning with the prompt's restrictions.
- **Format and Headings (Partial Match)**: Headings use the specified bullet style (•), which matches the prompt exactly. Sub-bullets use - (acceptable, though ground truth uses *). No "(none)" is needed, and it's correctly omitted.
- **Use of Element Names (Significant Shortcoming)**: The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML." The XML includes both `id` (e.g., "check_vip") and `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status"). The LLM lists only `id` values, omitting the descriptive `name` attributes entirely. The ground truth includes both (name primary, id secondary), providing fuller fidelity to the XML content. This is a strict violation, as it reduces readability and completeness—small but impactful error per instructions.
- **Phrasing and Detail (Minor Differences)**: Gateway change phrasing is concise but lacks ground truth's explicit versioning ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)") and bolding. No extra note like "(No other differences should be reported.)" is included, but this isn't strictly required.
- **Overall Strictness**: Factually sound but diminished by incomplete element representation (missing names) and slight phrasing variance, warranting a mid-range score with notable deduction (~3.5 points off perfect for detail omissions).
