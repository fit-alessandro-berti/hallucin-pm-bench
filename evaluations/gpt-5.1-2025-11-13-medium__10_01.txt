4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology Compliance (Vocabulary Policy)**: Perfect adherence. The LLM answer uses exactly "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with correct capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This is a strength, but it alone cannot salvage the score given the strict rubric. (+2.0 points)
  
- **Structure and Format**: The table structure is mostly correct (activities as rows, roles as columns, all six activities included, no extras). However, column headers differ slightly: LLM uses abbreviations like "AM (Account Manager)" vs. ground truth's full names without abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager"). No unwarranted content (e.g., no extra tasks/roles/columns). Minor formatting inconsistency (e.g., bolding absent in LLM, spacing in "R / A"). (-0.5 points deduction)

- **RACI Allocations (Core Correctness)**: This is the primary failure point, with significant differences from ground truth across multiple cells. The rubric emphasizes that RACI must reflect the narrative with exactly one Responsible per activity and appropriate Accountable roles (e.g., AM where fitting). While LLM maintains one Responsible per row and uses correct terms, the assignments deviate substantially:
  - **Receive Application**: CO is "I" (should be "C"). 1 error.
  - **KYC Review**: AM "C" (should be "A"); CO "R / A" (should be "R"); FC "I" (should be "C"). 3 errors (including unwarranted "A" on CO).
  - **Order Vetting**: Matches exactly. 0 errors.
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM "C" (should be "A"); CO "I" (should be "C"); FC "R / A" (should be "R"). 3 errors (unwarranted "A" on FC).
  - **Record Update**: IT "R / A" (should be "R"). 1 error (unwarranted "A").
  - **Notify Customer**: FC "C" (should be "I"). 1 error.
  
  Total: 9 errors across 24 cells (~38% mismatch rate). These are not minor; they alter accountabilities, consultations, and responsibles in ways that misrepresent the process narrative (e.g., shifting A's from AM to performers like CO/FC/IT). Even small discrepancies (e.g., "R" vs. "R / A") count as significant per the strictness directive. (-5.0 points deduction)

- **Overall Correctness and Self-Awareness**: Aligns with narrative in having one R per activity and AM accountable in key spots (e.g., Receive, Order Vetting, Notify), but fails to match ground truth's specific nuances (e.g., FC as C in KYC, AM as A in Payment). No self-awareness issues (N/A). The matrix is functional but inaccurate, warranting a low-mid score for partial structural/terminology success amid core content flaws.

This strict evaluation yields 4.5/10.0: Credit for policy adherence and basics, but heavy penalties for RACI inaccuracies that undermine the matrix's purpose.
