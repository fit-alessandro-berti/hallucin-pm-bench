**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, +1.0 base)**: Uses exactly the four mandated terms (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) with no synonyms or leaks. No deductions here.
- **Completeness of activities (-4.0)**: Covers only 4/6 activities from ground truth (misses **Compliance Officer Approval** and **Release Funds**, both explicitly described in narrative as escalation/approval and fund release/scheduling). Prompt requires "covering **every activity**"; failure to infer/distinguish all is a major omission despite "do not add" (GT shows they must be added as distinct).
- **RACI assignments (-2.5)**: Almost entirely incorrect vs. ground truth:
  | Activity | Key mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | **Intake Vetting** | Wrong: Comp Analyst I (GT: C), no Treasury I, Officer – (LLM implies -). Front R/A ok but notation wrong. |
  | **KYC Review** | Wrong: Officer I (GT: C), no Treasury I explicit. |
  | **AML Screening** | Identical errors to KYC. |
  | **Risk Scoring** | Major errors: No Front C; Comp R/A (GT: only R); Officer I (GT: A). |
  | Missing rows | Zero coverage for Approval (Officer R,A etc.) and Release (Treasury R,A etc.).
- **Notation/formatting (-1.5)**: Uses "R/A" (non-standard) vs. ground truth "**R, A**" or "**R**"/"**A**"; "-" vs. "–"; inconsistent bolding (only activities vs. GT's R/A); minor header/MD diffs.
- **Roles coverage (-0.5)**: Misses Consulted (C) entirely (uses I instead); incomplete per role/activity (e.g., no Front in later activities).
- **Overall**: ~70% deviation (missing content + errors). Strict penalty for incompleteness/small diffs yields low score; partial vocab credit prevents 1.0.
