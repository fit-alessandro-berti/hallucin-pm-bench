4.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No"), aligning with the ground truth. However, the justification contains critical errors: it incorrectly claims violations of Rules 1 and 2 (QE does precede RA in the trace, and VP follows both QE and RA), misstates the sequence for VP (it occurs after RA), and dismisses Rule 4 as inapplicable despite it being satisfied (CC follows NA and VP). Only Rule 3 is accurately assessed. These factual inaccuracies in referencing the trace and rules represent substantial deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria.
