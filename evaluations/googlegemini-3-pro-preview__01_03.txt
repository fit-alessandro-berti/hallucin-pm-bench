6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) (Decision Points)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two decision points and provides concise one-sentence descriptions that are substantively accurate. However, under strict evaluation, there are minor but notable differences in phrasing and precision: (1) The bypass rule uses "skipped *only* if" without explicitly stating the "otherwise proceeds" branch, slightly altering the conditional logic's clarity compared to the ground truth. (2) The TriVote description uses "vote in favor" instead of "record 'Approve'" and frames it as "approved for an offer" rather than "advance only when," introducing subtle deviations from the exact rule wording. These small wording discrepancies warrant a deduction, as the instruction demands utmost strictness even for minor variances. Score for (a): 8.0/10.0.
  
- **Part (b) (Documents List)**: The LLM lists documents in correct chronological first-appearance order for most items and avoids hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions). However, it omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" entirely, which first appears in Step 8 as a distinct required document (separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in Step 7). This results in an incomplete list of 8 items instead of 9, violating the "all documents required anywhere" criterion. The conditional note on "Deck Memo" is extraneous (ground truth lists it unconditionally as it is required in some paths), adding unnecessary detail that deviates from the simple ordered list format. These errors—especially the outright missing document—are significant under strict rules, causing major point loss. Score for (b): 4.0/10.0.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: The response is well-organized with headings, but includes extra elements (e.g., step references, italics, asterisks) not present in the ground truth, slightly inflating it beyond a direct match. No major hallucinations, but the combined issues (especially the omission in (b)) prevent a high score. Total: Weighted average yields 6.0/10.0, reflecting strict penalties for incompleteness and phrasing variances.
