### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (Full Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all verifiable functional changes: three added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), one removed task (Task_ManualReview), and two gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment, both exclusive → parallel). No unchanged elements, guesses, or commentary are included, fully adhering to the prompt's instructions on verifiable differences.
- **Structure and Headings (Full Credit)**: The three required headings are used verbatim and in the exact specified order. Output contains only these elements and the differences, with no extraneous content.
- **Formatting Details (Minor Deduction)**: 
  - Task listings: The prompt specifies "give the `id` followed by the `name` in parentheses" but does not mandate bullets or specific list styling. The LLM uses one item per line without bullets, which is a close but not identical match to the ground truth's bulleted list (using "-"). This is a small deviation in presentation.
  - Gateway changes: Matches the prompt's example format (e.g., `Gateway_X: exclusive → parallel`) exactly in syntax and symbol ("→"). However, the ground truth includes minor alignment spacing on the second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel") for visual parallelism, which the LLM omits (both on unaligned separate lines). This is a trivial formatting inconsistency.
- **Overall Strictness**: Content is 100% aligned, with differences limited to non-mandated stylistic choices (bullets and alignment). Under utmost strictness, these small presentation variances warrant a 0.8-point deduction from a perfect 10.0, as they create minor visual/output differences from the ground truth without violating core rules.
