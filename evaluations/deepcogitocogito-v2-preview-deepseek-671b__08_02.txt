The LLM answer correctly answers Q1 as "Yes" and provides the exact minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), with step-by-step reasoning that accurately describes enabling T5 via the alternative path while preserving P2. The explanation is concise (under 120 words in the summary) and aligns closely with the ground truth's logic.

Minor deduction for a factual error in the explanation: stating "Once T5 fires, T3 could follow later if needed" is incorrect, as T5 consumes the P2 token required by T3, disabling it afterward (as noted in ground truth). This small inaccuracy slightly undermines the completeness, but does not affect the core demonstration.
