The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. The answer correctly identifies:

- All three tasks added, using their IDs.
- The one task removed, using its ID.
- The gateway-type change, correctly specifying the gateway's ID and the nature of the change.

Small differences:
- The LLM only lists the task IDs, not both ID and name as the ground truth does (e.g., Task_VerifyIdentity vs. **Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)). While it does show the IDs, it omits the friendly task names, which the ground truth gives. That is a (minor) fidelity issue.
- In the gateway-type change, the LLM uses a concise style ("Gateway_Decision: Exclusive â†’ Inclusive") while the ground truth spells it out with both name and symbol. Again, that's a minor loss of explicitness and context.

Since answer content is 100% correct but formatting/context is not as rich as the ground truth, a point is deducted for strictness. Thus:

**Score: 9.0**
