10.0

The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the required BPMN 2.0 model per the prompt and superior to the ground truth in key respects: it includes all explicitly mentioned activities as tasks (e.g., the "checks warranty eligibility" task omitted in ground truth), uses verbatim task names with original casing from the prompt (e.g., "validates the claim" vs. ground truth's capitalized "Validate the claim"; "send rejection notice" lowercase vs. ground truth's "Send"), correctly sequences the warranty check task before its decision gateway, and includes no hallucinated elements beyond the prompt. Minor syntactic variations (e.g., default namespace vs. prefixed, isExecutable="true" vs. "false", descriptive flow IDs/conditions vs. numbered flows with name attributes, added but non-conflicting gateway directions/names, process name attribute, start event lacking a descriptive name present in ground truth) are allowable per the rubric's examples (e.g., different IDs/whitespace) and do not alter semantics or completeness. No omissions of prompt-required elements; two end events as specified; exact gateway types and count; all IDs prefixed "wrc_".
