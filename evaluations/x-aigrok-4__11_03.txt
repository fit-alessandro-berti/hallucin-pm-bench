8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in core requirements: correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, with identical quantification of excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s respectively) and waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). It also includes case volumes (465, 480, 1175), which are data-grounded and contribute to context, and uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations as instructed. The memo is concise (~140 words), formal, and limited to provided data/metrics without extraneous inventions.

However, under strict evaluation, deduct points for:
- **Structural differences (significant loss: -1.0)**: Lacks "From" and "Subject" fields present in ground truth; uses a simpler title instead of full header. No mention of total cases (e.g., ground truth's "4 805 completed cases").
- **Content omissions/additions (moderate loss: -0.5)**: No closing projection (e.g., ground truth's 35% cycle time reduction). Adds interpretive phrase "contributing to overall delays" not in ground truth.
- **Recommendations mismatch (significant loss: -0.5)**: All three actions differ entirely—LLM's are generic and tied to cases/wait times (e.g., "allocate additional resources," "streamline reviews," "prioritize automation"), while ground truth's are more specific but inventive (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"). Though LLM adheres better to "no inventions" rule, the deviation from ground truth wording/content reduces alignment.

Overall, high fidelity on identification/quantification (90% match) but clear divergences in format and recommendations prevent a perfect score.
