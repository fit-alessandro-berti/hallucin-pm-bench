7.0

- The LLM correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on SLA breaches and high waiting time. 
- It quantifies SLA overages and waiting times accurately for each activity.
- It avoids mentioning activities or metrics not in the table.
- It structures the recommendations as bullets per instructions.
- HOWEVER, it suffers notable issues:
    - Recommendations are generic and lack concrete, data-driven specificity. For example, "allocate additional resources," "streamline reviews," and "prioritize automation" are much vaguer than the ground truth actions based on the data (such as "add one risk analyst to the peak morning window," or "use a straight-through heuristic for loans under €25 k").
    - The LLM introduces imprecise targets in its recommendations (like "33% reduction in waiting time") not supported explicitly by the table or grounded in the data given.
    - The numbers for “cases” are stated within the recommendations despite the prompt not requesting this granularity in the recommendation bullet points.
    - The memo is less formal and lacks the specific, concrete improvement suggestions found in the ground truth.
    - The summary (“contributing to overall delays”) is less precise than the ground truth discussion of end-to-end cycle impact and restoring SLA compliance.
- These omissions and vague recommendations warrant a deduction of 3 points, as the recommendations and some summary points are not as data-driven or actionable as required.
