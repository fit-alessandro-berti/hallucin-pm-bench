**9.5**

The LLM answer correctly answers **No**, and cites the key counterexamples:  
- C003 (lines 6–7), where *Validate_Payment* comes before *Receive_Order*.  
- C005 (lines 11–12), where there is *Validate_Payment* without any *Receive_Order*.  

It accurately references line numbers and case IDs, and explains that the claim fails due to these counterexamples. The explanation is clear, precise, and justifies the answer logically.  

The only minor flaw (warranting a 0.5 point penalty):  
In C005, the LLM says: "Cancel_Order follows Validate_Payment without a prior Receive_Order (lines 11–12), further illustrating inconsistency with the stated rule." The ground-truth is stricter and simply notes that *Receive_Order* is absent in that case — referencing *Cancel_Order* is a minor distraction as the relevant logic is the absence of *Receive_Order*. This is an extremely small imprecision, but in strict marking, should cost the answer half a point.

Otherwise, the answer is fully correct and well justified.
