The LLM answer accurately responds with "No" and provides a precise, one-paragraph justification that correctly identifies and cites the key counterexamples (C003 lines 6–7 and C005 lines 11–12), directly aligning with the ground truth's emphasis on these instances to refute the "always" claim. Minor additions, such as noting compliance in other cases (C001, C002, C004), are factually correct, non-contradictory, and enhance clarity without introducing errors or deviations from the required format or log-based reasoning.
