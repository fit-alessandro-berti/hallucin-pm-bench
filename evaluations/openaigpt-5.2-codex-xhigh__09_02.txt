The LLM answer is highly similar to the ground truth in identifying the core issue (no timestamps/duration data, only counts) and conciseness, but loses points for: (1) omitting explicit reference to “Dual Authorization” (GT includes it for precision); (2) using “cannot be determined” vs. “impossible to compute” (slightly less emphatic); (3) “duration data” vs. “duration information” (minor wording); (4) lacking the explanatory clause “so the required start-to-completion intervals are absent” (GT provides fuller reasoning on why counts fail for cycle time). These small differences warrant deduction under strict criteria.
