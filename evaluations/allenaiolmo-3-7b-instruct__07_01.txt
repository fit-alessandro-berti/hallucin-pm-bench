3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks**: Items correctly identified (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), but listed **only IDs** instead of full names with IDs as in ground truth (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Format uses "-" bullets vs "*" bullets. Significant deviation (-2.0 points).
- **Removed tasks**: **Completely incorrect** – "(none)" instead of correctly identifying "Send RMA Label (id = `send_rma_label`)", which is present in v1 XML but absent in v2. Major factual error, violates "factual differences" requirement (-4.0 points).
- **Gateway type changes**: Core fact correct (gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway), but phrasing lacks "(v1)" and "(v2)" specificity, no backticks/bolding, minor format mismatch (-0.5 points).
- **Overall structure/headings**: Matches prompt's "•" bullets exactly, but differs from ground truth's **bold** headings and final note. No speculation (good), but strict format/content mismatch.
- **Strictness adjustment**: Ground truth is precise benchmark; LLM misses key removal (obvious from XML diff), uses incomplete task refs, and format variances. Partial credit for 2/3 categories partially right, but errors compound to low score.
