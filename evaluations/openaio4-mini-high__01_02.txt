### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is mostly accurate in identifying and summarizing the core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing all required documents without introducing unauthorized terminology. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth result in point deductions:

#### Decision Points (Partial Match, ~7.5/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the three key decision points and their branching logic (e.g., ≤2 vs. >2 difference; amount thresholds; board vote approve/reject). Uses exact activity names like "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Harmonisation Committee," "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)," "Amount Threshold Decision," and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)."
- **Errors/Deductions** (significant loss for precision and conciseness):
  - Adds unnecessary explanatory details not in ground truth, e.g., "Compare Senior Underwriter A’s score vs. Shadow Underwriter B’s score" (introduces phrasing absent in the concise ground truth condition).
  - Specifies next steps explicitly ("proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" or "proceed to NFC"), while ground truth uses neutral "continue" and omits explicit step names in branches for brevity.
  - Uses "requested amount" instead of exact "amount."
  - "Route to" vs. ground truth's "send to" for the ≥ €15,000 path.
  - "If difference > 2" is correct but phrased less elegantly than ground truth's "else ⇒ escalate" (implying >2 without stating it).
  - "Board votes to approve or reject" uses lowercase and lacks bolding/capitalization on "Approve" and "Reject" as in ground truth.
  - Omits positional context from ground truth: "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (this alters flow precision).
  - No use of italics or asterisks for conditions, reducing structural fidelity.

#### Required Documents (Partial Match, ~7.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Lists all six exact documents from the prompt without additions or omissions of core items. Matches terminology like "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)," "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet," etc.
- **Errors/Deductions** (significant loss for exact phrasing and completeness):
  - Formatting mismatch: Bullets vs. ground truth's numbered list (1–6), which affects presentation fidelity.
  - Minor phrasing additions not in ground truth or prompt:
    - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" adds "old" (ground truth/prompt: "≤ 3 months").
    - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" adds "single" and "or" (ground truth: "pay-stub/tax slip"; prompt: "single pay-stub or tax slip" – but ground truth simplifies, so extra word is a deviation).
    - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds "template" (ground truth: "(CIS)"; prompt: "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" – but ground truth omits "template," creating inconsistency).
  - Omits ground truth's closing note: "*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*" (this reinforces the non-standard process and is part of the expected output for completeness, per the prompt's emphasis on avoiding standard terminology).

Overall, the answer captures ~85% fidelity but incurs deductions for non-exact phrasing (5+ small additions/rephrasings), formatting variances, omitted context/note, and slight expansions that dilute conciseness. No major factual errors, but strict criteria treat these as significant (e.g., -0.5 to -1.0 per instance). A perfect match would require verbatim alignment where possible.
