**6.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies 3 decision points covering core elements (triage eligibility, finance pre-approval, value routing ≈ amount threshold). Documents list is **identical** (all 7 artefacts, conditional note on *AuditTrail* matches). Closing note on no others aligns. No introductions of undefined elements.
- **Major deductions (significant point loss per instructions)**:
  - **Decision points mismatch (-2.0)**: GT specifies exact 3 with precise naming, positions (e.g., "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**"), and **Senior_Auditor_Review** folded into #3 "final payment approval". LLM renames/invents ("Triage Agent Eligibility Decision", "Value-Based Routing Decision"), missequences (finance as #2 before value, no "after PreApprove"), omits senior as decision node.
  - **Missing branching logic/outcomes (-1.0)**: GT table explicitly details all paths (*Eligible* → continue / *Not* → reject; **> €1 000** → senior; *Approved* → payment / *Rejected* → end). LLM vague/implicit ("determines whether", "confirm validity", "if yes triggers"); **no rejection paths** mentioned—critical omission for "every decision point".
  - **Structure/format divergence (-0.5)**: GT uses table for decisions (#, description, logic) + numbered docs list. LLM uses informal numbered + bulleted; lacks tabular clarity/precision.
- **Net**: ~65% content fidelity; good but inexact/incomplete on core prompt ("summarise **every** decision point"). Strict policy penalizes phrasing, omissions, mismatches heavily.
