### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of core content (pairs identified and parallelism logic)**: Full marks here—the LLM correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can run in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), based on the description. No additional or missing pairs, aligning perfectly with the ground truth rationale.
- **Alphabetical ordering**: Perfect—pairs are sorted alphabetically both within (e.g., Create_Documentation before Quality_Check) and overall (C-pair before P-pair).
- **Format adherence**: Mostly good—the pairs use the required `Task_X  —  Task_Y` structure with proper em dashes and spacing around them. However, minor deduction for inconsistent spacing in the second pair (LLM uses single spaces after "Procure_Materials", while ground truth aligns with extra spaces for visual consistency), which is a small formatting error under strict evaluation.
- **Conciseness and output structure**: Significant deduction—the prompt specifies "Output one pair per line" in the exact format, implying a clean list without extraneous text. The LLM adds verbose explanations ("After carefully analyzing...", "These are all the task pairs...", "Thus, the complete list..."), repeats the list multiple times, includes unnecessary markdown blocks, and references a non-existent "process flowchart" (the description is purely textual, not a flowchart). This introduces inaccuracies and violates the implied minimalism, differing notably from the ground truth's streamlined list + concise rationale.
- **Overall strictness**: Core accuracy is strong (no factual errors on tasks/process), but the added fluff, repetition, and small inaccuracies (e.g., "flowchart") represent avoidable differences that inflate the response beyond the prompt's expectations. Under utmost strictness, this warrants a noticeable point loss despite the correct essence.
