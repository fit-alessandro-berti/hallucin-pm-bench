9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and almost perfectly matches the ground truth. The correct pairs are identified and outputted, the format is adhered to (with slight differences: the LLM did not use extra spaces to align the em dash as in the ground truth, and omitted code formatting). The answer includes a redundant markdown code block and some unnecessary explanatory justification, slightly deviating from the strict, concise output requested by the prompt and the ground truth.

**Errors:**
- Did not maintain double spaces for alignment before/after the em dash in the second pair, as in the ground truth.
- Includes extra narration and explanation not present in the ground truth.
- Provided output outside a code block, whereas the ground truth is fully within a code block.

These issues are minor but, as per the instruction to be "utmost strict," they warrant a point deduction.

**Final score:** 9.0
