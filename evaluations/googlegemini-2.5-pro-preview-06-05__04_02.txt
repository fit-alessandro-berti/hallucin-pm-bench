6.0

Rationale:
- R1: Correct (Compliant, good justification).
- R2: INCORRECT (LLM marks "Compliant", but ground truth says "Violated" because the correct reference is the *final* approval after the Change_Request, i.e., Manager_Approval on 07-Marâ€”Ship_Goods happened before this final approval and outside the allowed window; this is a significant error).
- R3: Correct (Violated, with appropriate justification).
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable).
- R5: Correct (Violated, proper justification).
- R6: Correct (Compliant).

Summary: The answer has 1 significant rule misjudged (R2), undermining compliance evaluation, although most justifications are correct and other rules are evaluated properly. Given the strictness required, this substantial rules-misinterpretation merits a pronounced deduction; thus, a 6.0.
