7.5

- **Q1**: Correct number (3), but omits the explicit list of cases (C123, C456, C789) as in ground truth, reducing precision despite conciseness.
- **Q2**: Identifies the correct activity ("Pack_Items"), but adds unnecessary explanatory text ("immediately precedes 'Ship_Order' in case C456"), deviating from the ground truth's direct format.
- **Q3**: Correct activity ("Cancel_Order"), but includes extra phrasing ("appears exactly once"), not matching the ground truth's brevity. Overall factual accuracy is high, but strict format differences warrant deduction.
