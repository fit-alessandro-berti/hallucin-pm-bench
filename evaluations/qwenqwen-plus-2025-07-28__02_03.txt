- The LLM answer gives the correct enumeration for each question: it states there are 3 distinct cases, correctly identifies "Pack_Items" as immediately preceding "Ship_Order" in C456, and recognizes "Cancel_Order" as the activity that appears exactly once.
- Points deducted: The answer omits naming the actual case values for question 1 ("C123, C456, C789"), which are included in the ground truth. Although the numeric answer is correct, the omission of actual case names constitutes a small but relevant loss of information.
