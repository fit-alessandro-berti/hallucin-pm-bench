The LLM answer proposes a fundamentally different solution: a new parallel gateway (GW_Parallel, not an allowed "event"), parallel branch with intermediate timer to Task_Triage, always firing after 48h (causing duplicate Triage execution, functionally incorrect). Ground truth uses interrupting boundary timer on existing Task_Receive (allowed event), one new flow to Task_Triage, only firing if stuck there. LLM violates constraints (adds unallowed gateway), mismatches placement/method/flows/XML impact, ignores "no new activities" spirit, and fails SLA logic. No structural/textual overlap beyond generic timer-to-Triage idea; total divergence.
