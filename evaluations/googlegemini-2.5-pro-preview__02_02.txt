The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth for all three questions:

**Q1:** Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases, with both enumeration and final answer matching the ground truth.

**Q2:** Correctly extracts and orders the activities for case "C002" as "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"—punctuation and sequence match perfectly.

**Q3:** Accurately finds and alphabetizes "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" as the distinct immediate predecessors to "Ship_Order", presented on separate lines.

There are no extraneous elements, errors, or omissions. The answer is precise, strictly follows the prompt's requirements, and matches the expected output in every detail.
