**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core content accuracy (high marks base: ~9/10)**: Correctly identifies *all* added tasks (3 exact: Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), *all* removed tasks (1 exact: Task_RejectLoan), and the sole gateway change (exclusive → inclusive on Gateway_Decision). No missed changes, no fabricated changes.
- **Penalties (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Extra interpretive notes (-1.5)**: Unauthorized notes ("*Note: New task ID replaces...*" and "*Note: Task ID removed and replaced...*") imply semantic replacement/renaming, violating "ignore cosmetic renamings" and "strictly under headings." Introduces misleading analysis not in ground truth or prompt. Small but significant error per instructions.
  - **Formatting/structure mismatches (-0.8)**: Headings use `###` (H3 markdown) vs. ground truth `* **Heading**`; bullets (`•`) vs. numbered lists (`1. 2. 3.`); ID-first `(name)` vs. name-first `` `id` ``; no final "(No other...)" disclaimer. Deviates from "exactly these headings" bullet style and ground truth presentation.
  - **Wording variances (-0.5)**: Gateway uses full BPMN terms ("**Exclusive Gateway**...**Inclusive Gateway**") vs. ground truth abbreviations ("**exclusive** (XOR)"..."**inclusive** (OR)"); minor phrasing ("(v1) to (v2)" vs. "*v1* to *v2*").
- **Overall**: Strong on facts (no hallucinations/misses), but extras, interpretation, and format drift reduce score significantly under "utmost strictness" and "small errors...significant loss." Perfect match would be 10.0; this is close but flawed.
