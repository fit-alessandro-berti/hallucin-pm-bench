**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer is strong overall (correctly identifies exactly 3 decision points and all 7 required documents without introducing undefined activities/artefacts), but loses points for **precision, structure, and exact alignment** with the ground truth under utmost strictness. Key deductions:

#### Decision Points (-1.5 total):
- **Correct count and core concepts**: Matches 3 points, covers eligibility (triage), amount threshold (>€1,000 branch), and pre-payment gate (approvals/prerequisites). Mentions rejection potential implicitly/explicitly where relevant. No extras introduced.
- **Deductions**:
  - #2: Omits precise timing ("*after* **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**" in ground truth); LLM vaguely says "If the refund amount exceeds €1 000, the process branches" without location anchor (-0.6). Names it "**High-Value Threshold Check**" (introduces phrasing not in process/ground truth, which uses "*Amount threshold*") (-0.4).
  - #3: Framed as "**Process_Refund_Payment Prerequisites**" (activity-focused gatekeeping) vs. ground truth's "*Final payment approval* at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review**" with explicit "*Approved* → payment; *Rejected* → ends" branching (-0.5).
  - Structure: Descriptive paragraphs vs. ground truth's precise table with "#", bold activity refs, and explicit "Branching logic / outcomes" columns (-0.3 for format mismatch impacting clarity/conciseness).

#### Required Documents (-0.1 total):
- **Near-perfect**: Exact 7 documents listed, correct associations, accurate high-value note for AuditTrail (universal applicability implied). Table adds value (shows "Activity Where Required" – all accurate, no inventions).
- **Minor deduction**: Lacks ground truth's simple numbered list + explicit catalogue note + "(No other documents or legacy activities...)" disclaimer (-0.1). Extra "Seven documents are mandated" phrasing is fine but not matching.

#### Other (-0.2):
- Unasked title/sections (##) and elaborate formatting: Helpful but deviates from ground truth's concise table/list style (-0.1).
- Fully adheres to "Do not introduce..." rule (+ bonus avoided).

**Summary**: 82% alignment – excellent content fidelity (no major factual errors, covers prompt fully), but strict penalties for non-identical phrasing, timing omission, decision framing, and structure reduce from 10.0. Perfect match would be 10.0; this is high-quality but differentiated.
