8.0

The LLM answer closely follows the ground truth, listing the three main decision points with the correct activity names and capturing the required logic at each point. It also lists every required document at submission time, using the correct names as stated.

Strengths:
- All decision points are present and clearly described.
- Document list is complete, with accurate names.
- No introduction of standard loan terminology.
- Correct order of activities and decisions.

Errors and reasons for point deduction:
- The description under "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" says "Only applies to amounts ≥ €15,000"; this could be clearer by retaining the explicit step logic as in the ground truth.
- The document list says "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" instead of "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months)", and "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" versus "pay-stub/tax slip". These are minor differences, but per the evaluation guidelines, exact wording matters.
- Doesn't restate the fact that "No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed," which—while not strictly asked for, is clarified in the ground truth answer.

These errors are minor but relevant under strict grading; thus, a deduction of 2 points is warranted for precision and completeness.
