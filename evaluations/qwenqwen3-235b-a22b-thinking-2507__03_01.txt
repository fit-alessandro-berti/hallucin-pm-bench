6.0

### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer captures the core process flow, including the start event, automatic classification, the two exclusive gateways (gw1 for password reset classification, gw2 for post-diagnosis decision), the rework loop from customer confirmation back to initial diagnosis, direct closure on confirmation, and end event. It correctly models the password reset path skipping diagnosis to instructions then confirmation, the diagnosis-to-resolve/forward branch, specialist forwarding leading to resolution, and overall sequencing without adding unmentioned elements like timers, escalations, or parallel paths. The XML is a single <definitions> block under 40 lines (~35), uses concise IDs, and includes valid sequence flows. No extraneous diagram/interchange elements are present.

However, under utmost strictness, several significant deviations from the ground truth and prompt warrant major deductions (each small-to-medium error deducts ~0.5-1.0 points from a base of 10.0):

- **Invented extra activity (major error, -2.0)**: The description mentions "Resolve Issue" only once as a singular activity (reused semantically for both agent and specialist paths per lines 5-6). The ground truth correctly reuses a single <task id="t4" name="Resolve Issue"/> for both (t5 → t4). The LLM invents a second <task id="t6" name="Resolve Issue"/> after forwarding (t5 → t6), adding an unmentioned duplicate activity element despite the prompt's explicit "Do not invent or add ... activities ... that are *not* mentioned." This fabricates structure and inflates task count to 7 elements vs. ground truth's efficient 6.

- **Invented decision conditions (medium error, -1.5)**: BPMN conditions should not introduce unmentioned variables/logic (prompt forbids inventing gateways/events/activities). LLM adds specific, hallucinatory expressions like `classification == 'Password Reset'`, `diagnosis == 'resolve'`, `diagnosis == 'forward'`, `confirmation == 'yes'`, and `confirmation == 'no'`, implying nonexistent process data/variables. Ground truth uses neutral, non-inventive `yes`/`no` tied to gateway names (e.g., "Password Reset?" branches). This violates "exactly as stated" and adds ~5 lines of fabricated XML.

- **Missing/incomplete element attributes (small errors, cumulative -0.5)**: No names on startEvent, endEvent, or gateways (ground truth includes descriptive names like "Ticket Submitted", "Ticket Closed", "Password Reset?", "Customer Confirms?" for clarity). Process lacks `name="Support-Ticket"` and `isExecutable="false"` (ground truth has them). Minor task name variance ("Automatic Classification" vs. ground's "Auto-Classification"). gw1's default flow (to t3) lacks a condition (ground has `no` on both branches for symmetry).

- **XML structure deviations (small errors, cumulative -0.5)**: Missing `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` declaration (present in ground). Different `targetNamespace` ("http://acmetech.example.com" vs. "http://acmetech/support"). Unnecessary `xmlns:xsi` and `xsi:type="tFormalExpression"` in conditions (ground omits, keeping it minimal). Process `id="process"` is generic vs. ground's descriptive `id="support_ticket"`.

These issues show partial hallucination (extra task, invented conditions) despite correct high-level logic, misaligning with the prompt's anti-invention rule and ground truth's concise, reusable model. No criminal/escalation additions, so no full refusal, but strict grading yields 6.0—functional but flawed XML.
