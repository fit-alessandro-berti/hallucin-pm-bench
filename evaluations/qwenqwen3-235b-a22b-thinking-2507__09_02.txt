The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, conciseness, and core reasoning (impossibility due to absent timestamp data preventing duration calculation), with only minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; omission of explicit "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals" references) that do not alter accuracy but slightly reduce completeness under strict evaluation.
