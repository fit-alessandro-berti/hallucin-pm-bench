9.0

The LLM answer delivers the key point concisely: that the lack of timestamp data makes it impossible to calculate cycle times for "Dual Authorization." However, it omits the explicit mention of both the *absence of duration information* and does not explicitly say that "only event counts" are provided, both of which the ground truth answer makes clear. Strictly interpreted, these small omissions (not spelling out explicitly that only counts are present and no intervals are available) reflect a minor but significant loss from full accuracy and completeness, hence a 9.0 score.
