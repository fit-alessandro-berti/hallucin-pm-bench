**9.5**

The LLM answer is semantically perfect, accurately identifying all changes (3 added tasks, 1 removed task, 1 gateway change from exclusive to inclusive) with no misses, extras, or violations of instructions (e.g., ignores renamings like name changes). It strictly uses the exact required headings and groups content appropriately.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for:
- Stylistic formatting differences (bullets vs. numbered lists; ID-first vs. name-first order; ### headings vs. * **bold**).
- Gateway phrasing uses precise XML tags ("exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway") vs. semantic terms ("exclusive (XOR) → inclusive (OR)"), slightly diverging from prompt example ("Exclusive → Inclusive").

No content errors; utmost strictness applied only to small presentational variances.
