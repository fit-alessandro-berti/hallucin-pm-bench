8.0

- The LLM answer includes all structural changes: it correctly identifies the added tasks, the removed task, and the change in gateway type.
- However, there are **notable issues**:
  - It unnecessarily lists the gateway name change ("Gateway name changed from “Eligible?” to “Eligibility Check”") as a gateway-type change, which the prompt explicitly says to ignore cosmetic renamings.
  - The formatting does not fully align with the example in the ground truth (e.g., providing both label and ID in parentheses), though this is more minor.
- No actual change from exclusive to inclusive is missed, but calling out the name change when told to ignore such changes is a fairly major reading adherence error.

**Strictness per instructions:** The answer is otherwise complete but loses substantial points for the inclusion of the disallowed name change detail (a small but explicitly ruled-out error), and the minor mismatch in label/ID detail, resulting in a score of 8.0.
