The LLM answer is correct in stating that it's impossible to calculate the average cycle time for "Dual Authorization" due to lack of timestamps or duration data. However, it could be more explicit by mentioning that only event counts (i.e., occurrences) are provided, as the ground truth answer does. The absence of this detail—stating explicitly that only event counts are given—represents a minor omission, hence a one-point deduction.
