The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), matching the ground truth content exactly with proper id (name) format and «old → new» syntax.

However, under utmost strictness, there are small but verifiable formatting differences resulting in significant point loss:
- Extra blank lines after each heading (3 instances).
- Extra blank lines between bullet points in ADDED TASKS (2 instances).
- Missing alignment spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" (approximately 5 spaces in ground truth for visual alignment of "exclusive → parallel").

These whitespace discrepancies prevent a perfect match to the ground truth's compact, aligned structure. Content perfection merits high score, but strict formatting deducts 1.0 point.
