7.5

The LLM answer is correct and precise on questions 1 and 2, with exact matches to the ground truth values, calculations, and formatting (minor notation differences like "%" placement are negligible). For question 3, the response is concise (under 100 words) and touches on misrepresentation and skewing risks, aligning broadly with caution against over-generalization (iii). However, it fails to explicitly mention the single-occurrence issue (i) or detail variance/instability (e.g., noise from one case, wide confidence) (ii), making it generically superficial rather than analytically rigorousâ€”deducting 2.5 points for these omissions under strict criteria.
