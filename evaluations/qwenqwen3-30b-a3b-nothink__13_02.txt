**8.0**

**Rationale:**

1. The numeric answers (1, 2a, 2b) are **precisely correct**: "1 time", "2.08%", and "8.33%" match the ground truth computation and rounding.
2. The explanation for question 3 is **generally correct but lacks technical specificity**. The LLM answer mentions that the activity may not be representative and its use can "skew models or performance metrics," which aligns in general terms with (i) the single-observation issue and (iii) the risk of over-generalizing. 
   - However, the answer **omits explicit reference to instability/variance (ii)** (e.g., that a single case leads to high variance or wide confidence intervals).
   - It also **lacks a concrete example or reference** (e.g., cycle time, transition probability, or resource load) found in the model answer.
   - The answer is *slightly vague* and could be improved by more precisely highlighting instability and impact on metrics.
3. No extraneous information or invention, and the response is within the word limit.

**Point deductions:**  
-1.0 for not mentioning statistical instability/variance/consequence of single observation  
-1.0 for not providing specifics/examples of metrics that may be affected

Thus, **8.0/10.0**.
