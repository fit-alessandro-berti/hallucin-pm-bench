The LLM answer is factually precise and fully aligns with the ground truth across all questions, with no differences, errors, omissions, or fabrications. Minor elaborations (e.g., timestamps and per-case explanations) are accurate and do not deviate from the required content, so they do not warrant deductions under the strict criteria.
