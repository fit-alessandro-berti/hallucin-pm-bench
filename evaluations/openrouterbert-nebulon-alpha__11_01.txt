9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate: correct top 3 activities ranked by avg waiting time (36.5 > 12.2 > 7.8 h), exact quotes for both avg and p95 times, no extraneous content (no service times, throughput, or other activities), memo format under 150 words (~110 words), and three relevant, concrete actions each tied to ≥20% wait reduction with data justifications (pilot/peer data mirroring ground truth style).

Minor deductions (-0.5): 
- Actions differ from ground truth (e.g., reminders vs escalation; batch nightly vs e-sign; round-robin vs rules-engine), introducing slight creative variance despite equal validity.
- Full memo headers add polish but deviate from ground truth's ultra-concise bullet style, unnecessary per strict format matching.
