3.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Decision Points (Major Deviation, -4.0 points)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 precise decision points with clear branching logic (eligibility check, amount threshold, final approval/rejection). The LLM inflates this to 6 points, inventing or over-interpreting non-decision steps as decisions (e.g., treating **Process_Refund_Payment** and **Issue_Confirmation_Letter** as explicit decision points with checks for preconditions like *BankTransferAuthorization* or payment success, which are not described as decisions in the process; adding "implicit" elements like prior outputs). This introduces undefined branching and violates the prompt's rule against adding activities/artifacts. The high-value check is correctly placed but framed inaccurately as a standalone "decision" without exact outcomes. Small additions like "confirm legitimacy" in auditor review are not in the description, amplifying errors.
  
- **Required Documents (Moderate Deviation, -1.5 points)**: The ground truth provides a single, complete, exhaustive list of all 7 defined documents, noting conditionality for *AuditTrail* without extras. The LLM scatters documents across steps (no unified list), redundantly mentions *RefundRequestForm* in non-submission steps, includes undefined "outputs" or "implicit information" as documents (e.g., prior step outputs, refund amount info), and omits a clear catalogue. While it covers most documents, the lack of structure and additions (e.g., implying *EligibilityChecklist* as input to unrelated steps) create inconsistencies and bloat.

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness (-1.0 points)**: The LLM correctly excludes the legacy activity and follows the process order broadly but introduces verbosity, implications, and structures (e.g., numbered summary with bolding) not in the ground truth, diluting precision. No hallucinations of new activities, but embellishments count as errors under strict criteria. Base score starts high for relevance but drops sharply for mismatches.
