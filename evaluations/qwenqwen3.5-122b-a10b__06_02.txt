The LLM answer is semantically and structurally identical to the ground truth: it correctly identifies and lists exactly the three parallel blocks from Process B only, in the correct order, with tasks separated by commas on numbered lines, adhering precisely to the prompt instructions. No extraneous content, sequential tasks, or references to other processes. Minor whitespace variations (e.g., single vs. potential double spaces after commas) are insignificant and do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they do not alter meaning, readability, or compliance.
