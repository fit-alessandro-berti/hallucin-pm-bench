6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**  
- The "decision points" and "required documents" are clearly separated and labeled.
- Uses exact activity names where it matters (e.g., Quick KYC Verification, Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision).
- Required documents are correctly listed by name and match the ground truth.

**Errors and Omissions:**

1. **Incorrect Decision Point Inclusion:**
   - The LLM includes **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** as a "decision point," but this is incorrect. The process does not branch or require a decision at this stage; it's a verification step, not a decision point. (Major error.)
   - The ground truth identifies only three decision points: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA). The LLM's answer misses the explicit mention of the Final Micro-loan Board Approval as a separate, third decision point; instead, it only references it within the amount threshold, losing separation/clarity.

2. **Activity Sequence/Context:**
   - The answer doesn't clarify that the Underwriter Alignment Gate comes **after Dual Underwriter Split** or that the Amount Threshold Decision comes **after Neighbourhood Feedback Check**. The ground truth shows correct sequencing and context. (Moderate error.)

3. **Level of Detail:**
   - For **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**, the LLM only says that "≥ €15 000 → requires Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" but doesn't state that the board votes approve/reject (as required by ground truth). (Minor but relevant error.)

4. **Document List Minor Detail:**
   - "Latest Income Statement (pay-stub or tax slip)" is fine, but for maximal fidelity, should mirror ground truth wording exactly ("pay-stub/tax slip" instead of "pay-stub or tax slip," though this is extremely minor).

5. **Terminology:**
   - LLM answer does quite well not introducing standard loan terminology, and uses required terminology.

6. **Additional (Though Minor) Flaws:**
   - Does not explicitly state that "No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard documents are needed" (as in the ground truth's footnote). Strict marking counts this as a minor deduction.

**Summary:**  
The inclusion of KYC as a decision point and the failure to list the Final Micro-loan Board Approval as a clearly distinct decision point are the main reasons for this substantial deduction. Sequence/context clarity is also missing. While the required documents list is essentially correct, these moderate errors result in a 6.0.
