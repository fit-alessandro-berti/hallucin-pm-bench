### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% of Score Weight)**: The ground truth identifies exactly three decision points: Underwriter Alignment Gate (with precise conditional logic and context), Amount Threshold Decision (with context after NFC), and Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as a binary vote. The LLM correctly describes two (Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold), but incorrectly includes Quick KYC Verification as a "decision point" (it is a mandatory verification step, not conditional or decisional). It also entirely omits the MBA as a distinct decision point, treating it only as an outcome of the threshold. No contextual positioning (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") is provided, violating the prompt's emphasis on exact flow and terminology. This introduces inaccuracies and incompleteness, warranting severe deduction.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors, ~40% of Score Weight)**: The list is nearly complete and accurate, matching all six items verbatim where possible. However, small inconsistencies include: "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"; "pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (formatting/ wording); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "Community Impact Statement (CIS)" (extra "template" from prompt but not echoed exactly in ground truth). The added note on the variant is extraneous but not harmful. These are trivial phrasing issues but, per instructions, reflect in point loss.

Overall, the response is partially helpful but deviates significantly from the ground truth's structure, completeness, and fidelity to the process flow, especially in misidentifying and omitting core decision points. Strict grading penalizes these as foundational flaws.
