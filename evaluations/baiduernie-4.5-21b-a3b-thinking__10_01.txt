2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (strong match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This adheres strictly to the vocabulary policy.
  
- **Structure and Format (partial match, +0.5 points)**: The table format is correct (activities as rows, roles as columns). Activities match the six process steps. However, roles are abbreviated (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of using full names (Account Manager, etc.) as in the ground truth, which is a deviation from the provided roles listing and process description. The LLM introduces an explanatory "Key" and "Terminology Note", which are unwarranted extras not present in the ground truth, violating the "no unwarranted content" rubric.

- **RACI Allocations (major errors, -7.0 points for significant deviations)**: This is the core failure. The ground truth reflects a detailed inference from the narrative, with exactly one Responsible (R) per activity, appropriate Accountable (A) roles (often AM), and populated Consulted (C)/Informed (I) entries for multi-role involvement. The LLM oversimplifies, leaving most cells blank (e.g., no C/I for CO/FC/IT in Receive Application; misses A for AM and C for FC in KYC Review), incorrectly combines R/A in places where ground truth separates them or assigns A differently (e.g., Payment Clearance lacks A for AM and C for CO; Record Update has I for AM instead of C, and no I for CO or C for FC), and adds ungrounded entries (e.g., C for IT in Payment Clearance, where ground truth has I). Each activity has mismatches in 2–4 cells, failing to "reflect the narrative" with full RACI detail. No activity fully matches.

- **Overall Correctness and Strictness Adjustment**: Under utmost strictness, even minor formatting differences (abbreviations, extras) deduct heavily, but the RACI content errors are disqualifying—small details like blank cells or role abbreviations compound to show incomplete adherence. Base score starts high for terminology but collapses due to core mismatches. No self-awareness issues apply.
