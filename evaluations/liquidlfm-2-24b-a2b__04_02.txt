The LLM answer fails critically on R2 (ignores post-change final approval timing), R3 (inverts clear date sequence: Pay_Invoice 2025-03-06 before Receive_Goods 2025-03-07), and R5 (ignores Ship_Goods/Pay_Invoice before new Manager_Approval post-Change_Request). Correct on R1/R4/R6 only. Wrong overall (COMPLIANT vs NON-COMPLIANT). Format minorly acceptable but content has 50% rule errors + justification flaws; strict deduction for factual misreads.
