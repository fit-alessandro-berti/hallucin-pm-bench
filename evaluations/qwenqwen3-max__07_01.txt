5.0

• Added tasks  
— check_vip  
— generate_qr  

• Removed tasks  
(none)  

• Gateway type changes  
— gw_valid (from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway)

Rationale:  
- Correctly identified the two added tasks and the gateway type change.
- Did NOT list the removed task send_rma_label (id = send_rma_label), which is a core omission; this is a significant factual error and deserving of major point loss.
- Did not use the exact display formatting or inclusion of names and IDs as suggested in the ground truth, but mostly adhered to XML element names.
- The output is concise and not speculative, but failing to report a removed task is a major error; therefore, 5.0 is an appropriate grade.
