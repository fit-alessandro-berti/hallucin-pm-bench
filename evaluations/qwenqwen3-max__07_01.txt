### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: Partial credit (incomplete matching). The LLM correctly identifies the two added tasks by their IDs (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), which align with the XML elements. However, it fails to use the full names as in the ground truth ("Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code"), violating the prompt's requirement to use "element names exactly as they appear in the XML" (interpreting "element names" as the `name` attributes for tasks, per ground truth). This is a small but strict error, warranting deduction. No speculation or extras, which is good.
- **Removed tasks**: Major failure (0/10 for this section). The LLM incorrectly states "(none)", missing the clear removal of `send_rma_label` (present in v1, absent in v2). This is a factual omission directly readable from the XML snippets, contradicting the ground truth and prompt's emphasis on listing *only* factual differences without speculation. This alone justifies a severe penalty under strict evaluation.
- **Gateway type changes**: Strong match (near-full credit). The LLM accurately notes the change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`, closely mirroring the ground truth in content and structure. Minor formatting differences (e.g., no explicit v1/v2 labels) are negligible but noted for strictness.
- **Overall Structure and Compliance**: Headings match the prompt exactly (â€¢ Added tasks, etc.), and "(none)" is used appropriately where applicable (though incorrectly for removals). No speculation or extras reported, adhering to instructions. However, the critical error in removed tasks dominates, leading to a low total score. With utmost strictness, even partial mismatches compound the major issue.
