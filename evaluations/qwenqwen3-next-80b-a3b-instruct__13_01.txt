10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt's constraints (no inferences beyond the log lines). All four questions are answered correctly without hallucination:

- Q1: Exact match (1 occurrence, stated clearly).
- Q2: Exact match (5.56%, with transparent calculation).
- Q3: Exact match (identifies only A1002, no extras).
- Q4: Provides two valid, clearly stated reasons that align directly with ground truth options (temporal bias matches exactly; selection bias encompasses small sample size and case-mix bias without deviation or unjustified additions).

Minor phrasing differences (e.g., wording in Q3 or elaborative examples in Q4's temporal bias) are stylistic and do not introduce errors or inferences.
