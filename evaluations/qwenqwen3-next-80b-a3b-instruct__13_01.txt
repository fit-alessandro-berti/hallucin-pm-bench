9.2

**Justification:**

1. **Question 1:** Correct: "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs exactly once. (Fully correct, matches ground truth.)
2. **Question 2:** Calculation and rounding are fully correct: (1/18)×100 ≈ 5.56%. (Matches ground truth.)
3. **Question 3:** Correctly identifies case "A1002" as the only containing "Manual_Fraud_Check."
4. **Question 4:** 
   - The LLM gives: 
     - "Temporal bias" (matches one of the ground truth points, though the LLM says "the fragment covers only a single day," slightly overstating—strictly, we see only times from 09:00 to 14:05, not a *full* day. Minor imprecision.)
     - "Selection bias: only four cases… potentially non-random sample." This is less precise than "small sample size" or "case-mix bias," but within strictness bounds, "very small and potentially non-random sample" is quite close to "small sample size" and somewhat overlaps with case-mix bias.
   - Both listed reasons are relevant, and based strictly on the fragment (no hallucinated data).

**Deductions:**
- There is a minor loss for not explicitly quantifying "small sample size" in the "selection bias" reason, and for the slightly loose wording on the time window for temporal bias. However, these are minor, and don't constitute added information or hallucination.

**Conclusion:** Closely matches the ground truth, with only very minor differences in phrasing and explicitness. Hence, 9.2.
