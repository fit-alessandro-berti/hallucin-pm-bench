1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Question 1, asserting "No" when the ground truth is "Yes," and provides a flawed explanation that ignores the alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) to enable T5 without T3. It fails to provide the required minimal firing sequence and instead erroneously claims none exists. This is a complete reversal of the fact, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
