1.0

The LLM answer is entirely incorrect:

- For **Q1**, the correct answer is "Yes", but the LLM incorrectly asserts "No".
- For **Q2**, instead of providing the minimal sequence T1, T2, T7, T4, T5, it states "No sequence exists" and provides a logically flawed explanation.
- The explanation shows misunderstanding of the synchronisation in the net and overlooks the fact that P2 can remain unconsumed while the token in P5 is produced independently of T3.

These errors reflect a fundamental misreading of the Petri net's behaviour and requirements for transition firings. Thus, the answer merits the lowest possible score: 1.0.
