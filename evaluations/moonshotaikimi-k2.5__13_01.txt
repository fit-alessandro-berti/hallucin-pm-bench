**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match in substance, accuracy, and adherence to the system prompt (no inferences beyond the log data, all answers derived directly from the 18 lines). 

- Q1: Correct count ("1"), precise (line 7 reference optional but factual).
- Q2: Exact value ("5.56 %"), correct calculation shown.
- Q3: Exact case ID ("A1002"), correct exclusivity.
- Q4: Two valid reasons from ground truth options ("small sample size" verbatim match; "temporal bias/limited coverage" as strong variant of "temporal bias," with precise data reference to single day and no unjustified assumptions—superior to ground truth's minor "morning" inaccuracy, as logs span to 14:05).
