2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, +1.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) with no synonyms or leaks. No violations.
- **Structure & format (poor, -3.0)**: Markdown table present, but deviations include: no dashes (–) for no involvement (uses I incorrectly); **R/A** shorthand vs **R, A**; inconsistent bolding; short Activity header vs padded; extra parenthetical in activity name ("(for cases with Risk Scoring > 70)").
- **Activities (major violation, -4.0)**: Prompt forbids adding/renaming/merging. LLM adds 4 extra ("Schedule the payment", "Release the funds", "Notify the originating analyst") not matching ground truth's exact 6; splits/merges narrative elements incorrectly (e.g., no "Schedule" or "Notify" in ground; "Release the funds" mismatches "Release Funds"; descriptive approval name).
- **RACI assignments (mostly incorrect, -3.0)**: Only **Risk Scoring** matches perfectly (4/4 cells). Core 4 activities: **Intake Vetting** 2/4; **KYC Review** & **AML Screening** 1-2/4 each (wrong: Front C vs –; Comp Analyst R vs **R, A**; Comp Officer A vs C). Added rows fully mismatch (e.g., **Release Funds**: Comp Analyst/Comp Officer C vs I).
- **Completeness/coverage (partial, -1.0)**: Covers all roles but inflates with extras; misses ground truth's precise involvement (e.g., – vs I).
- **Total**: Heavy penalties for content/format mismatches outweigh vocab adherence. Strict deduction for every cell/activity difference yields 2.0.
