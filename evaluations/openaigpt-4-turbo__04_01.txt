**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Final verdict**: Correctly identifies "Non-compliant" (matches ground truth).
- **Rule 1**: Correct assessment (satisfied/complies).
- **Rule 2**: Correct assessment and reasoning (violated; `Ship_Goods` at #8 before `Risk_Assessment` at #9).
- **Rule 3**: **Major error** (says "complies" but ground truth correctly flags as violated). LLM incorrectly claims `Three_way_match` (#10) is "within two activities" after `Goods_Received` (#6) via "6 -> 7 -> 10", blatantly misreading/skipping events #8 and #9 (actual distance = 3 > 2). This is a fundamental trace misinterpretation, warranting severe deduction under strictness rules.
- **Rule 4**: Correct assessment (satisfied/complies).
- **Rule 5**: Correct assessment (satisfied/complies).
- **Overall structure/summary**: Minor format differences (e.g., bolding, "complies/violation" phrasing vs. "Satisfied/Violated"), but identifies only 1/2 violations. Misses Rule 3 violation entirely, reducing completeness.
- **Strictness adjustment**: Single major factual/trace error + missed violation = significant penalty (equivalent to ~40% inaccuracy in justifications); no credit for final verdict alone. Small trace-reading issues compound under "utmost strictness/small errors = significant loss."
