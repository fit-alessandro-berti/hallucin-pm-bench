The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately assesses R1, R3, R4, and R6 statuses and justifications with minimal differences. However, it commits a major error on R2 by marking it Compliant with flawed reasoning (failing to account for the change request requiring a new approval, making Ship_Goods untimely relative to the final approval on 03-07), which is a core misinterpretation of the rules' interactions. R5 justification is slightly imprecise in wording but captures the violation. Under strict evaluation, this substantive error on one rule deducts significantly, though the format and brevity are adhered to well.
