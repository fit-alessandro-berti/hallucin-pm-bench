R1: Correct evaluation and justification.

R2: Incorrect. The LLM answered "Compliant" because Ship_Goods is within 2 days of the Finance_Approval. However, for "expedited" cases with a Change_Request after approvals, a new Manager_Approval is required, and the 2-day timer must start after the final approval (which is actually on 07-Mar). So, according to the rules, this is a violation. That's the most serious flaw.

R3: Correct evaluation and reasoning.

R4: Correct, matches ground truth.

R5: Correct violation and sound justification.

R6: Correct, matches ground truth.

Overall: Correct, matches ground truth.

Most of the answer aligns well with the ground truth (including the format), but the R2 error is significant. There are no other substantial differences. Because R2 is an essential compliance criteria, this warrants a loss of two full points out of ten. Premises and short justifications are otherwise adequate.
