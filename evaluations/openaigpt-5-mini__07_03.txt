7.0

- The LLM answer correctly identified all added and removed tasks and accurately listed the gateway type changes.
- However, it omits the required hyphens ("-") before each list item, as shown in the ground truth, and does not precisely match the formatting (e.g., gateway changes are surrounded by « » rather than the ground truth's use of ": " and alignment; though this is a very minor issue).
- More strictly, the LLM answer also omits the spaces after colons in the "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" section and does not align the gateway names or formatting exactly to the ground truth.
- While these are minor formatting errors, per instruction, small errors must lead to significant loss of points. Therefore, a deduction of 3 points is justified. The answer would functionally receive full marks for content, but format errors reduce its strict score.
