8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the two gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), matching the ground truth content exactly. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for formatting deviations: absence of bullet points (-) in ADDED TASKS, REMOVED TASKS, and GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES (present in ground truth); incorrect inclusion of guillemets (« ») around gateway type changes (not in ground truth or prompt example); and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry. These small but verifiable inconsistencies result in a deduction from a perfect score.
