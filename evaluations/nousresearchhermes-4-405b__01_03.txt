4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM identifies three decision points, but the ground truth specifies only two (the risk-based skip conditional and the TriVote gate). The first LLM point (Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome) is not a decision point or conditional branch—it is merely an input step producing a rating; this is a clear misidentification and hallucination of an extra element (major deduction: -3 points). The second point accurately captures the skip rule but uses slightly imprecise phrasing (e.g., "→ Skip Manual Underwriting" vs. ground truth's explicit "bypasses... otherwise proceeds"). The third point is mostly accurate but abbreviates officer names (e.g., "Credit/Regulatory/Sustainability" vs. full "Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer") and simplifies the rule wording (e.g., "to pass" vs. "record 'Approve'"), introducing minor inaccuracies (further deduction: -1 point). Overall, partial credit for covering the core elements but penalized heavily for the extraneous and incorrect point, resulting in ~4/10 for this section.
- **Part (b)**: The list is incomplete and partially disordered relative to first appearances. It correctly includes the first five documents and Offer Sheet 77 (step 7), but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (explicitly required in step 8 as a distinct signed version, separate from the unsigned preparation in step 7; major deduction: -3 points for missing a required document). It then incorrectly places ID Matrix Declaration (step 8) immediately after Offer Sheet 77, skipping the signed version in sequence, and ends with Loan Dossier 2025 (correct). No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), but the omission and sequencing error make the list inaccurate (further deduction: -1 point). Overall, ~5/10 for this section due to the critical gap.
- **Overall Score Calculation**: Averaging sections with strict weighting for differences (e.g., extra/missing elements treated as substantial deviations per instructions) yields 4.0. The response is directionally helpful but diverges meaningfully from the ground truth in structure, completeness, and precision, warranting a low-mid score under utmost strictness.
