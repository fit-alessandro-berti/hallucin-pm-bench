6.0

**Assessment and Justification:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM divides the decision points into three:
  1. Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome (simply determines risk).
  2. Conditional branch after risk-check for skipping underwriting.
  3. TriVote Decision-Gate.
- The **ground truth** lists only *two* actual *decision points*: the risk-based branch (combined with the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome) and the TriVote approval gate.
- The LLM's **first point—Risk-Check outcome—is not a decision point** per process (it only sets up the branch, not a gate itself). This is a conceptual error. Deduct significant points.
- The exact wording for the TriVote and risk-based branch is present but less clear/specific than the ground truth (e.g., the LLM doesn't precisely articulate the “bypass” logic and underplays the exact composition/rule for the TriVote).
- The LLM does **not explicitly note that Sustainability Officer participation is mandatory** (though arguably not required in this summary).
- The ground truth’s branches are described more fully and precisely.

**b) Document List**

- The **first five documents** (Form 14B, Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow, Deck Memo) are correct.
- The LLM then lists "Offer Sheet 77", "ID Matrix Declaration", and "Loan Dossier 2025".
- **Critical missing item:** “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is omitted, even though it is specifically required in the process at the “Request-Applicant-Confirmation” step before “ID Matrix Declaration”. This is a clear factual error, and the ordering is therefore off from the ground truth.
- No hallucinations (e.g., KYC, AML, credit-bureau files).

**Overall:**  
- Clear error in the number and nature of decision points outlined (3 instead of 2, includes a non-decision action).
- Omission of a required signed document that appears in the process.
- Ordering of the latter documents is somewhat imprecise.
- These issues (one extra false point, a missing required document, an imprecise formulation of rules) merit a **significant deduction** but do not warrant a failing score since no hallucinated items or completely fabricated steps appear, and major process elements are represented.

**Strict score: 6.0**
