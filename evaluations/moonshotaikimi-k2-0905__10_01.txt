5.0

**Justification:**

- **Vocabulary adherence:** The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" and does not mention any forbidden terms. No deduction here.
- **Structure:** The matrix itself is correct in terms of orientation and role names (AM, CO, FC, IT), but abbreviates roles rather than writing them in full (as required by the ground truth).
- **RACI assignments:** There are **significant errors and omissions** in the responsibility assignments:
  - *Accountable (A)* designations are largely omitted from the LLM answer; ground truth uses R/A (Responsible/Accountable) for Account Manager in several steps, which is not captured.
  - The LLM mixes up roles on several activities (e.g., for "Receive Application" only Account Manager is marked R, while ground truth has the AM as R/A, and other roles as C or I).
  - The LLM omits participation (C/I) of most roles outside the principal one in each activity, which **misses important collaborator/informed/consulted assignments** that are present in the ground truth.
  - The LLM is inconsistent with the use of “Consulted” and “Informed”—for example, it lists only one primary role for each step, whereas the ground truth often has three or four roles per row.
- **Formatting:** The use of role abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full role names (Account Manager, etc.) is a non-trivial deviation given the ground truth.
- **Severity:** Because several activities miss co-responsibility and consultation, omitting the full mapping of roles to each step, this is a **critical flaw** for a RACI matrix.

**Summary:**  
The answer avoids the major vocabulary error but **significantly fails** to replicate the full set of RACI responsibilities and proper formatting. Partial credit is appropriate for partial role mapping and full compliance with terminology, but strictness demands significant penalty for missing “Accountable,” underusing “C” and “I,” and not using full role names. Hence, **5.0**.
