### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance appear exactly as specified, with no forbidden terms). It also adheres to the core narrative by assigning exactly one Responsible (R) per activity, matching the process description's "handled by" or "performed by" assignments: AM for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Notify Customer, CO for KYC Review, FC for Payment Clearance, and IT for Record Update. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced, satisfying the "unwarranted content" criterion.

However, under utmost strictness, the answer diverges significantly from the ground truth in several critical ways, warranting substantial point deductions:
- **Column headers**: Uses abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full names (Account Manager, Compliance Officer, Finance Clerk, IT Support). This is a clear formatting and precision error (4 differences).
- **RACI assignments**: While Rs are correctly placed, the answer omits all Accountability (A) designations, which the ground truth explicitly assigns to AM for most activities (e.g., R/A vs. just R). It also under-assigns Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles across nearly every cell:
  - Receive Application: Missing C (CO), I (FC), I (IT); AM is R vs. R/A (4 errors).
  - KYC Review: AM is C vs. A; missing C (FC), I (IT) (3 errors).
  - Order Vetting: Missing I (FC), I (IT); AM is R vs. R/A (3 errors).
  - Payment Clearance: AM is I vs. A; missing C (CO), I (IT) (3 errors).
  - Record Update: AM is I vs. C; missing I (CO), C (FC) (3 errors).
  - Notify Customer: Missing I (CO), I (FC), I (IT); AM is R vs. R/A (4 errors).
  This results in ~20 cell-level mismatches, failing to "reflect the narrative" fully as per the notes (e.g., no accountability for AM where "appropriate").
- **Formatting and extras**: Includes an unwarranted title ("RACI matrix – FinCo order-to-cash activities"), lacks bolding on key elements (e.g., **KYC Review**, **R**), and uses dashes (–) instead of explicit blanks or matches GT's style. These are small but compound errors under strict evaluation.
- **Overall fidelity**: The answer provides a minimal, inferred RACI but ignores the implied fuller involvement of roles (e.g., consultations/informations based on workflow sequence), leading to an incomplete matrix compared to the ground truth's comprehensive version.

The score reflects partial credit for terminology, core Rs, and no extras (boosting from ~1.0), but heavy penalties for the pervasive mismatches (~60% of content differs), omission of As/Cs/Is, and formatting issues.
