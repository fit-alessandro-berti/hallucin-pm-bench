- Minor deductions for: non-matching label format (descriptive headers vs. **A1/A2/A3**), different case order in A1 (C456/C123/C789 vs. sorted C123/C456/C789), inconsistent backtick formatting on activity names, and slight header verbosity in A2. Content accuracy perfect, but strict format adherence lacking.
