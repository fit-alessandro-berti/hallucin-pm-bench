10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth answer exactly:

- Q1: "3 distinct cases" (correct: C001, C002, C003).
- Q2: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" (sequence for C002, correctly extracted and ordered).
- Q3: Lists "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" as the only (distinct, alphabetically sorted) activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" (verified by traversing the cases).

The reply is also clear, justifies each decision with extracts from the provided data, and neither omits nor invents any information. No factual, logical, or formatting errors are present.

There are no errors, so the answer receives a strict 10.0.
