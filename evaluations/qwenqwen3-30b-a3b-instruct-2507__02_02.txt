The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, structure, and precision for all three questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the identical sequence without deviations; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line, with no extras, omissions, or formatting errors. No hallucinations or inaccuracies detected, warranting full marks under strict evaluation.
