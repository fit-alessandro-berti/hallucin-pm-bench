The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] for Q2, with a concise explanation that accurately describes the enabling of T5 via the alternative path while P2 remains tokenized, confirming T5 precedes T3. It stays within the 120-word limit. However, it deducts points for lacking the step-by-step markings (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}) and the explicit note on T5 disabling T3 afterward, reducing thoroughness compared to the ground truth's structured detail. No factual errors, but minor omissions in analytical depth warrant a strict deduction.
