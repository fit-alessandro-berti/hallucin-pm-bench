5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Correct status (Compliant) and justification (matches ground truth intent; ≤20 words). No deduction.
- **R2**: Major error—incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification ignores impact of Change_Request requiring new approval on 2025-03-07, making Ship_Goods non-compliant (>2 days after final approval). Significant deduction for misinterpreting rule sequence.
- **R3**: Correct status (Violated) and justification (exact match; ≤20 words). No deduction.
- **R4**: Correct status (Not Applicable) and justification (matches; ≤20 words). No deduction.
- **R5**: Correct status (Violated), but justification incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice as a further step before new approval, unlike ground truth). Minor deduction for partial mismatch.
- **R6**: Correct status (Compliant) and justification (matches; ≤20 words). No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by R2 error. Format adheres to prompt (status bolded, justifications concise), but content errors dominate under strict criteria. Total reflects ~70% accuracy (5/6 rules correct, one critically wrong).
