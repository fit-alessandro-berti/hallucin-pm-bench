6.0

- R1: Correct (Compliant, correct justification).
- R2: Incorrect (LLM marks Compliant, but a Change_Request happened after approvals, requiring a new Manager_Approval; Ship_Goods occurred before that — so it's Violated, per ground truth).
- R3: Correct (Violated, with correct justification).
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable, correct reason).
- R5: Correct (Violated, correct reasoning).
- R6: Correct (Compliant, correct justification).
- Overall result: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).

**Deductions:**
- Major error in R2, which is a strict rules reasoning error, indicating a lack of careful attention to process logic (−2 pts).
- The justification for R2 is insufficient: it ignores the “last required approval” after Change_Request, which is a substantial accuracy error (−1 pt).
- The rest of the points are accurate and justifications mostly concise and correct (no stylistic deduction).
- Total: starting from 10, −4 for above, leaving a 6.0 due to a major process logic flaw.
