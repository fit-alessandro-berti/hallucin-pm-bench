The LLM answer is functionally perfect, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with exact IDs, names, and change notation matching the prompt's specifications and XML diffs. No extraneous content, commentary, or unchanged elements mentioned.

However, under utmost strictness, formatting differences from the ground truth deduct points significantly despite being minor:
- Missing "- " bullet prefixes on all 6 list items (3 added, 1 removed, 2 gateways).
- Lacking column alignment spaces in the second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" vs. LLM's "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel").

These are small but consistent deviations (no bullets anywhere, no alignment), warranting deduction from perfection but not major content errors. Content fidelity: 100%; format match: ~85%. Overall: 9.0.
