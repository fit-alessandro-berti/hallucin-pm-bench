5.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs but incurs significant deductions for: (1) failing to output *only* the pairs in the specified format (adds unnecessary introductory and closing text, uses bullet points instead of plain lines); (2) incorrect alphabetical order within the second pair (Quality_Check before Create_Documentation, violating C before Q); (3) incorrect overall list order (starts with "P" instead of "C" for the first task in each pair); and (4) minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., extra spaces, bolding not required). These deviations from the prompt's strict instructions, even if small, result in a mid-range score under utmost strictness.
