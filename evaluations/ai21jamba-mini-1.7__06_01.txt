7.5

The LLM answer is mostly correct but loses points for the following reasons:

- The pair “Quality_Check — Create_Documentation” is returned, but not in strict alphabetical order within the pair. The ground truth specifies alphabetical order within each pair, which means this should have been “Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check.”
- For the second pair, “Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines,” the order is correct within the pair.
- The overall list contains the pairs in the same logical order as the ground truth, so no reproduction penalty accrues there.
- The instruction to output one pair per line and to use a specific format is mostly followed, though the bullet points (“-”) are not part of the required output format; the correct output is to have each pair on its own line, with no extra symbols.

Due to these issues (especially the lack of strict alphabetical ordering within the first pair and a slight formatting inaccuracy), I deduct 2.5 points from a perfect 10.0.
