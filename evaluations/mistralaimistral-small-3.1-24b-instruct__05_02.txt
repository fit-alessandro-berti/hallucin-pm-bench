6.0

The LLM answer correctly follows instructions to propose exactly ONE SLA-compliance improvement and does not add or delete any activity elements or sequence flows. It makes a valid change by reducing a due date (on "Prepare Contract") and provides a clear, reasonable rationale.

However, this does not match the ground truth, which specifically requires changing "Collect Equipment" from 5 days to 2 daysâ€”an action that would be much more impactful for SLA compliance (since it's the largest due date and directly affects total process duration). Instead, the LLM answer reduces "Prepare Contract" from 2 days to 1 day, which only gains 1 day, leaving the largest bottleneck unaddressed.

The LLM answer does not introduce prohibited modifications and is well-formatted, but misses the key improvement needed per the ground truth. For this significant error, a substantial loss of points is warranted, hence 6.0.
