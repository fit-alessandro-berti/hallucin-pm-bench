The LLM answer proposes an entirely different modification (changing "Prepare Contract" dueDate to P1D instead of "Collect Equipment" to P2D), uses an incorrect and non-standard diff format (multi-line hunk without proper @@ markers and including unnecessary context), and provides an unrelated rationale that does not reference the 3-day SLA, resulting in complete misalignment with the ground truth.
