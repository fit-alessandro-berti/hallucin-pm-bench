6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, and metrics)**: The LLM correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120.0 h; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44.0 h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4 h). All quoted figures match the table verbatim. No other activities or service times are discussed. (+3.0)
- **No unwarranted content**: Includes forbidden throughput metric ("Total Executions: 1,920"), which violates the prompt's explicit rule against discussing throughput. Also adds an extraneous general recommendation on customer satisfaction, not requested. (-1.0)
- **Action relevance and adherence**: Actions are concrete and logically tied to waiting times, each promising ≥20% reduction. However, they lack "data-driven" support (e.g., no pilots, estimates, or table-referenced evidence, unlike ground truth's specifics like "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%"). This is a key prompt requirement, treated strictly as a significant shortfall. Memo stays ≤150 words (~120) and focuses on waiting times. (-1.5, adjusted up slightly for concreteness but penalized for data gap)
- **Overall structure and fidelity to ground truth**: Crisp memo format, but less concise than ground truth's bullet style; extras dilute focus. Strict lens on differences (format, unsupported actions, forbidden metric) warrants deduction from perfect score.
