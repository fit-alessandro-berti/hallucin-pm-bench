7.0

The LLM answer does several things well:

- Correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities strictly by waiting time, quoting both avg and 95th percentile for each, all matching the data.
- Only those activities are discussed, and waiting-time metrics are correct.

However, notable errors and strictness must penalize:

1. **Action Specificity and Data-Driven Nature:**  
   - The actions are too generic compared to the ground truth. For example, "implement a document digitization and automated verification process" is less targeted than "deploy automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation triggers," which directly addresses waiting (queue) time for collecting documents, as per the ground truth.  
   - The actions lack mention of supporting data (e.g., pilot test results, estimated % reductions), which are required to be "data-driven."

2. **Exceeding Scope and Word Limit:**  
   - It includes a "Total Executions" line (not asked for).
   - The memo closes with a general recommendation about customer satisfaction and efficiency, adding superfluous content (redundancy per the prompt: “omit all non-waiting metrics”).
   - The memo slightly exceeds the word count (157 words versus the ≤ 150 words constraint), unless section headings are excluded, but formatting style differences could have been tighter/clearer to fit the 150-word requirement.

3. **Action Promises:**  
   - While actions say "to reduce by 20%" or similar, they don't state supporting evidence or actual projected/observed reductions (the ground truth is explicit, e.g., "pilot tests show a ≥25 % cut").

Given the prompt's demand for "utmost strictness" and visible deficiencies primarily around the specificity, data-driven detail, and minor excess/unwarranted content, a 3-point deduction is warranted, resulting in 7.0.
