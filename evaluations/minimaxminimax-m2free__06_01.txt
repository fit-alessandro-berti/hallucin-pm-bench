The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel, in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall list), and outputs one pair per line. The pairs match the ground truth semantically and in task names. However, it deviates slightly from the specified format by omitting spaces around the em dash ("—")—the prompt shows `Task_X  —  Task_Y` with spaces (two after X, one after —)—and lacks alignment spacing in the second pair for visual neatness as in the ground truth. This minor formatting inconsistency warrants a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria. No other errors or extraneous content.
