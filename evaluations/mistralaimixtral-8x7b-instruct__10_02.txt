**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Major structural error (-3.0)**: Incorrect RACI format. Standard RACI (as in ground truth) has *roles as columns* and *R/A/C/I letters in cells*. LLM inverts this (R/A/C/I as columns, roles scattered in cells), rendering it non-standard and unusable.
- **Role mismatches (-2.0)**: Missing "Operations Manager" (present in every ground truth row). Uses "IT Support" (ok, from source) but no comprehensive role set matching ground truth. Fills with conditionals ("if needed", "if high-risk") not in ground truth or source—pure invention.
- **Assignment errors (-2.0)**: No row matches ground truth RACI letters exactly (e.g., "Receive": LLM has TA as R only vs. ground truth TA-R, RL-I, OM-A, IT-C). Empties abound (e.g., no Accountable for several tasks—critical RACI flaw). Invents Informed/Consulted roles without source basis (e.g., IT Support Informed on release).
- **Task wording deviations (-0.5)**: Minor but strict: "transfer instruction" vs. "Payment Instruction"; "perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**"; combines "Release payment and ensure SWIFT" vs. "Release Payment"; "case file" vs. "Record". Misses bolding mandated "**KYC Review**".
- **Missing elements (-0.5)**: No **Legend**. No mandated task phrasing consistency (e.g., ground truth headers precise).
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit +1.0)**: Correctly uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst” where applicable—no violations there.

Total differences are extensive (format, roles, assignments, details); score reflects ~80% mismatch under strict criteria. LLM covers source tasks but fails as faithful RACI reproduction.
