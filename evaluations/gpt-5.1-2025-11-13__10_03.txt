### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, without synonyms or leaks (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", or "Sanctions Check"). This avoids a complete failure but is undermined by additions elsewhere. (+2 points baseline; no deduction here.)
- **Activity Identification and Structure (Major Violations)**: The prompt strictly forbids adding, renaming, or merging activities, requiring coverage of *every activity described* using authorized vocabulary. The LLM adds 4 extraneous activities ("Approval of cases...", "Scheduling payment...", "Releasing funds...", "Notifying...") not directly named in the narrative, splits "release funds" and "schedule payment" into separate rows, and treats "notify" as a distinct activity. The ground truth consolidates into exactly 6 activities ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring", "Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"), mapping narrative elements without extras. This over-expansion and invention is a core breach. Added parenthetical descriptions (e.g., "(paperwork completeness)", "against global watchlists", "on a 0–100 scale") further alter activity phrasing unauthorizedly. (-5 points; severe deviation.)
- **RACI Assignments (Significant Inaccuracies)**: Assignments differ in 12+ cells across rows, including critical mismatches:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst (I vs. C), Compliance Officer (I vs. –).
  - **KYC Review** & **AML Screening**: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. –).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Compliance Analyst (R, A vs. R), Compliance Officer (C vs. A), Front-Office Analyst (I vs. C). This misattributes accountability (narrative implies Compliance Analyst derives but Officer oversees escalation).
  - Extra rows introduce ungrounded RACI (e.g., "Scheduling payment" assigns Compliance Analyst C and Compliance Officer I, but ground truth merges into "Release Funds" with different consultations).
  - Use of "I" for non-involvement instead of "–" (as in ground truth) is inconsistent with the key points provided.
  These errors compound, as even minor cell differences (e.g., I vs. – or C) indicate flawed process mapping. (-3 points; strict penalty for per-cell variances.)
- **Formatting (Minor Issues)**: Markdown table is produced, but lacks bolding on activities and R,A designations (present in ground truth for emphasis). No explanatory text or merging, but extras inflate the table unnecessarily. (-0.5 points.)
- **Overall Fidelity**: The output captures the process outline superficially but deviates substantially in structure (8 vs. 6 rows), content additions, and RACI precision, failing to mirror the ground truth's concise, narrative-faithful mapping. Under utmost strictness, this warrants a low score despite vocabulary adherence—differences are numerous and material, not trivial. Total: 2.0 (minimal credit for core terms; heavy deductions for additions, splits, and inaccuracies).
