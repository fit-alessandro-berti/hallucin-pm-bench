8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, `gw_valid` type change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway) with no extras or misses, adhering to the prompt's categories and "only factual differences" rule. Structure matches headings exactly.

Deductions for strict comparison to ground truth:
- **Significant**: Tasks listed by `id` only instead of descriptive `name` + `(id = \`id\`)` format (e.g., "check_vip" vs. "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)" – core content mismatch in presentation).
- **Moderate**: List markers use `-` vs. `*`; gateway phrasing is concise ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway") vs. verbose ("`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), lacking backticks, bolds, and version labels.
- **Minor**: Lacks final note "*(No other differences should be reported.)*"; slight spacing differences post-headings.

Semantically perfect (10.0 base), but textual/format differences warrant -2.0 under utmost strictness.
