**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" and the key shortcut via T2b to enable T5 without prior T3, with accurate markings and prefix sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5). However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:

- **Major difference in firing sequence**: LLM provides a 4-step sequence where T3 never fires, interpreting "T5 before T3" as T5 firing without T3 ever occurring. Ground truth provides the 6-step sequence 〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉, explicitly demonstrating both transitions fire with T5 first (using feedback T6). This misses the intended ordering proof.
- **Incorrect "shortest" claim**: LLM calls 4 steps "shortest"; ground truth proves 6 is minimal for the full order (acknowledging 4-step lower bound but requiring +2 for T3 post-T5).
- **Incomplete explanation**: LLM emphasizes permanent skip of T3 ("may never fire"); ground truth explains bypass + feedback enabling T3 *after* T5, with bullets on why it works and minimality proof.
- **Structural differences**: LLM uses numbered list + conclusion; ground truth uses inline markings, bullets, and formal ⟨sequence⟩ notation.

These are substantive content errors (wrong sequence, missed feedback loop, flawed "before" interpretation), warranting major point loss despite partial overlap. No minor errors tolerated per instructions.
