The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets in the exact order, using accurate task names and referencing the parallel constructs as described in the prompt. It adheres strictly to focusing only on Process B with no extraneous information. Differences are limited to minor stylistic elements: an introductory phrase (not present in ground truth), use of "and" instead of the "â€–" symbol for parallelism, parenthetical references to splits (vs. ground truth's "parallel block" phrasing), bold formatting vs. backticks, and absence of the ground truth's explicit closing statement on no other parallels. These do not alter the factual content or completeness but represent small presentational variances, warranting a minor deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
