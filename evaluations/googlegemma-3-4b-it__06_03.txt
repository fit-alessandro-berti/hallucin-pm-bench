**9.0**

The LLM Answer closely matches the ground truth answer in both content and order:

- It correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks.
- It numbers the sets in the right order.
- It precisely lists only the relevant tasks and ignores Processes A and C as instructed.

However, some minor points of strictness (per instructions):

- The ground truth answer clearly labels the sets as "Set 1 – first parallel block" and "Set 2 – second parallel block," including a brief clarifying phrase in each item. The LLM's answer, while functionally equivalent, omits these explicit labels and explanatory wording.
- The ground truth also finishes by explicitly noting: "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." The LLM answer omits this disclaimer.

These omissions, although minor, mean the answer is not a perfect formal match. Therefore, I deduct 1 point for strictness and give it a **9.0**.
