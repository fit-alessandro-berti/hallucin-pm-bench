The LLM answer is fully correct in content, matching the ground truth exactly on all three answers (number of cases, preceding activity, and unique activity). Minor differences in formatting (e.g., no labels like "A1:", no case listing in A1 despite it not being required by the prompt, simple bullets) and rendering (escaped underscore) do not constitute errors under the prompt's "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction, as the core responses align precisely. No deductions applied.
