4.5

Rationale:
- R1: The LLM marks this rule as "Violated" incorrectly. The ground truth marks R1 as "Compliant" since the initial sequence (Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval) is correctly present for the amount > €10 000; the Change_Request is handled under R5, not R1. This is a significant error and affects the outcome substantially.
- R2: Incorrectly marked as "Violated" in the LLM, but the explanation is contradictory. The LLM says, "Last required approval was 2025-03-04 08:17, Ship_Goods occurred 2025-03-05 10:26 (within 2 days), but compliant." However, based on the rules and ground truth, R2 should be "Violated" because, after the Change_Request, the last required approval is 2025-03-07 15:10 (Manager_Approval), and Ship_Goods was shipped before that—not within 2 days after the last approval. The justification fails to capture the correct post-Change_Request approval logic, but the final status "Violated" incidentally matches.
- R3: Correctly identified as "Violated," with correct justification.
- R4: Correctly marked as "Not Applicable," with an accurate justification.
- R5: Correctly marked as "Violated," but the justification misses that both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before the new Manager_Approval, only mentioning Ship_Goods.
- R6: Correctly marked as "Compliant," justification is briefly sufficient.

Other issues:
- The answer is formatted almost according to instructions.
- The overall result, "NON-COMPLIANT," is correct.

Points mainly lost due to:
- Critical error on R1 assessment.
- Poor/confused justification in R2.
- Justification for R5 omits parts of the violation.
- Minor wording and format deviations.

Therefore, strict grading dictates a significant loss of points, leading to a score of 4.5.
