4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Major error (wrong status: Violated vs. Compliant; justification confuses R1 with R5, ignoring initial approvals) → Significant deduction.
- **R2**: Partial match (status correct, but justification contradictory and uses wrong "last approval" date, missing post-change approval impact) → Major deduction.
- **R3**: Exact match (status and justification align) → Full credit.
- **R4**: Exact match → Full credit.
- **R5**: Status correct, but justification incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice, focuses only on Ship_Goods) → Moderate deduction.
- **R6**: Exact match → Full credit.
- **Overall**: Correct, but format deviates (no table structure as in ground truth; bullet-style instead) → Minor deduction.
- **General Notes**: Strict assessment penalizes inaccuracies heavily; content accuracy ~60% due to key rule misinterpretations, despite correct overall conclusion. Justifications exceed brevity in places (e.g., R1 >20 words indirectly via confusion).
