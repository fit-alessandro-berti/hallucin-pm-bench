7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of Overall Conclusion (Weight: High)**: Both the LLM answer and ground truth correctly conclude "Non-compliant" based on violations of rules 2 and 3. This is a strong match (+2.5 points).
- **Identification of Violations (Weight: High)**: The LLM accurately identifies the key issues in rules 2 (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods) and 3 (Three_way_match too far after Goods_Received). It cites the correct events (#4, #8, #9 for rule 2; #6, #10 for rule 3), aligning well with the ground truth (+2.5 points).
- **Completeness (Weight: Medium)**: The LLM provides a numbered justification but only addresses the violated rules (2 and 3), omitting explicit checks for rules 1, 4, and 5 (which are satisfied per ground truth). The prompt requires "a numbered justification that cites the relevant rules," and while violations are "relevant," the ground truth's comprehensive coverage of all rules demonstrates thoroughness. This partial coverage is a notable gap (-1.0 point).
- **Accuracy of Details (Weight: High, Strictness Applied)**: For rule 2, the explanation is precise and matches ground truth. For rule 3, the LLM correctly notes the violation (>2 distance) but inaccurately states "distance of 4" instead of the ground truth's "distance = 3" (intervening activities: #7, #8, #9). This is a small but clear calculation error in interpreting "distance ≤ 2" (likely confusing index difference of 4 with intervening count of 3), warranting significant deduction under strictness guidelines (-1.5 points).
- **Format and Clarity (Weight: Low)**: The LLM follows the required format ("Non-compliant" followed by numbered justification) concisely, with clear event citations. Minor deduction for less detailed phrasing compared to ground truth's bolded rule headers and explicit satisfaction statements (-0.5 point).

Total: Starts at 10.0 base for correct conclusion; deductions for incompleteness, error, and format yield 7.5. The answer is effective for the core task but lacks the ground truth's exhaustive rigor and precision.
