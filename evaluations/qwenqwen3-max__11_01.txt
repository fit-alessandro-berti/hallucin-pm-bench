7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities and metrics)**: Perfect match. The LLM correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) and quotes the exact avg and 95th-percentile values from the table (e.g., 36.5h/120.0h, etc.). No errors here.
- **No unwarranted content**: Fully compliant. No mentions of service times, throughput, or other activities. Stays focused on waiting times only.
- **Memo structure and constraints**: Strong. Formatted as a crisp executive memo (header, subject, concise body <150 words), which aligns with the prompt better than the ground truth's raw bullet style. Signed appropriately.
- **Actions**: Partial match, leading to point deduction. Each action is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation to reduce delays), and implies ≥20% reduction, but they differ entirely from the ground truth's specifics (e.g., LLM suggests auto-emails vs. ground truth's reminders/escalations; no "data-driven" elements like pilot tests, estimates, or percentages per action—only a generalized claim at the end). This lacks the ground truth's evidence-based phrasing (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%"), violating "data-driven" strictness. Minor formatting in metrics (e.g., "h" vs. " h") is negligible but noted per instructions.

Overall, high fidelity on facts and structure (boosting score), but significant divergence in action details/content (20%+ penalty for strictness on differences).
