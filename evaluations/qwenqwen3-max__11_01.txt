7.2

The LLM answer closely matches the required output but loses points for several issues:

**Positives:**
- Identifies correctly the three activities by highest average waiting time and ranks them, quoting both average and 95th-percentile waiting times exactly as in the table.
- Does not include service-time or throughput figures.
- All recommendations are data-driven and logically target waiting time.

**Deductions:**
- The actions offered, while plausible, are less concrete/specific than the ground truth:
    - For #1 (Request_Documents), "auto-send" is less targeted than the ground truth's specific use of "automated reminders with escalation triggers," and lacks mention of proven pilot/tested effectiveness or quantified impact.
    - For #2 (Send_Closure_Letter), "auto-trigger" is vaguer than the ground truth's replacement of manual batch printing with same-day e-signature letters, again missing quantified effectiveness.
    - For #3 (Assess_Liability), "pre-load claim data" is plausible but weaker and less targeted than "rules-engine pre-classification so simple cases bypass queue," and lacks any outcome estimate.
- "Ranked by avg. waiting time" is imprecise wordingâ€”the ground truth uses "strictly by waiting-time" and provides a full, standard ranking.
- Slightly verbose sign-offs ("Process-Mining Team").
- "Eliminating manual triggers or prep delays" is extra/summary commentary, not present in ground truth.

**Summary:**  
- Minor verbatim inaccuracies.
- Actions are less specific, less data/impact-supported than the ground truth.
- Slightly imprecise/extra wording.

Thus, 7.2 reflects good structure, ranking, and figures, but significant loss from less concrete, less quantified, and less tightly worded recommendations.
