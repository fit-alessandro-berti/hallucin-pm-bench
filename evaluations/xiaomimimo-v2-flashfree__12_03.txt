7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correct core answer ("No")**: Matches ground truth (+2.0 points).
- **Correct identification of counterexamples (C002, C004)**: Accurately cites sequences with intervening activities, directly refuting "always" (+3.0 points).
- **Partial justification**: Focuses on violations (sufficient for disproving "always"), but lacks exhaustiveness by omitting compliant cases (C001, C003), unlike ground truth's case-by-case table (+1.5 points).
- **Factual error**: Claims "where the order of these activities is reversed" – no such reversal exists (Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order); this introduces inaccuracy (-2.0 points).
- **Structure and completeness**: Less structured (no table, no summary of compliant cases or quantification like "two out of four"), reducing alignment with meticulous analysis (-1.0 points).

**Total differences from ground truth**: Minor incompleteness + clear extraneous error warrant deduction under strict criteria, but core logic holds.
