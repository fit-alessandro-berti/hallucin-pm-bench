6.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Factual correctness (full credit: +10 base)**: All changes are accurately identified—no additions, removals, or gateway changes missed or invented. Matches XML diffs precisely (added: `check_vip`, `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; `gw_valid`: exclusive → inclusive).
- **Categories complete (no deduction)**: All three required headings present; none incorrectly marked "(none)".
- **Strict deductions for differences vs. ground truth (-3.5 total)**:
  - **Headings not exact** (-1.5): Prompt requires "• Added tasks" etc.; LLM uses `##` markdown headers; ground truth uses `**bold**` without bullets. Significant deviation from "exact headings".
  - **Item format mismatch** (-1.5): LLM uses verbose full XML tags (e.g., `<task id="check_vip" name="Check Customer VIP Status"/>`), including unnecessary XML syntax, spaces, and full attributes. Ground truth uses concise "Name (id = `id`)" format. Violates "use the element names exactly" (interpreted as id/name values, per ground truth).
  - **Gateway phrasing/style** (-0.5): LLM verbose with full tags; ground truth concise "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)". Minor but adds unneeded details.
- **Minor style diffs** (-0.0, no further deduct as covered): Bullets (`-` vs `*`), no final note in LLM (extra in ground truth anyway).
- **Overall**: Perfect facts but presentation deviates notably from ground truth/prompt format → 6.5 (mid-tier; strict penalty for non-textual match despite semantic accuracy).
