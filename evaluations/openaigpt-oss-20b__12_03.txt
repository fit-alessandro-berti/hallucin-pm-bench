The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering "No" and providing a clear, case-by-case justification with relevant sequences and citations, mirroring the ground truth's structure and conclusions. Minor deductions for: (1) a clear but insignificant typo ("after B" instead of "Receive_Order" in the conclusion, which does not alter meaning); (2) slightly less precise table headers (e.g., no emphasis on "around Receive_Order" or use of symbols like ✅/❌ for visual clarity). These small presentation issues warrant a deduction under strict evaluation, but the core analysis is identical and evidence-based.
