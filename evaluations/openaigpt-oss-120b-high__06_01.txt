The LLM answer listed both correct pairs, correctly ordered within pairs, and in the correct final order. However, there is a small formatting deviation: it does not include the same spacing (the ground truth has multiple spaces between "Procure_Materials" and the em dash). While this is a minor difference, per the instruction to apply “utmost strictness” where “small errors should reflect in significant loss of points,” a full point is deducted for this formatting inconsistency. The content is otherwise accurate and complete.
