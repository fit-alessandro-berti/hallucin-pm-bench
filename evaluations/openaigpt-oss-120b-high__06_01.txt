The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs identified (the only two parallel pairs: Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), alphabetical ordering within pairs and overall list, and one-pair-per-line format. The minor difference in spacing (no alignment padding in LLM output) is cosmetic and does not affect correctness per the prompt's format specification.
