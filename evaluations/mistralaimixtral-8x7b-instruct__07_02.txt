**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks (8/10)**: Correctly identifies all 3 added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), matching ground truth content. However, lists only IDs without bolded names as primary (e.g., **Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)), deviating from GT format/structure. Minor but penalized per strictness.
- **Removed tasks (1/10)**: Major factual error—incorrectly lists **Task_ApproveLoan** as removed (same ID exists in v2; only name changed from "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan", which is cosmetic renaming to ignore). Correctly lists Task_RejectLoan, but extra wrong item + erroneous note ("new task with same name but different behavior") invalidates section entirely.
- **Gateway-type changes (7/10)**: Correctly notes change from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision. However, less precise (no "XOR"/"OR", no explicit "*v1* to *v2*", phrasing "formerly Gateway_Decision" implies renaming which is cosmetic).
- **Overall structure/compliance (-3 penalty)**: Adds unrequested "Additionally..." paragraph discussing ignored cosmetics (flows, renaming), violating "exactly these headings" and "ignore cosmetic renamings". Bold headings and numbering ok but not matching GT's markdown precisely (e.g., no italics for *v1*/*v2*, different list style).
- **Total**: Significant deviations, especially factual error in removals, warrant low score despite partial correctness elsewhere. No credit for ignored elements like flow changes.
