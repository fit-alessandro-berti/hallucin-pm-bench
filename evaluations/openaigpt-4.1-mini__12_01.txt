The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in content, verdict, and evidence (correctly identifying reversed ordering in cases 1001/1003 and absence in 1002, disproving the "always immediately before" claim). Justification cites cases, activities, and supporting details (timestamps vs. line numbers) equivalently. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: direct phrasing ("not accurate") vs. labeled "Short verdict" ("inaccurate"); bullet format vs. inline bullets; no explicit "reversed" or "false" summary phrasing; and omission of "evidence-based" header, despite identical factual fidelity. No substantive errors, but strict evaluation penalizes format variances.
