8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120.0h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44.0h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4h), quotes metrics verbatim, stays under 150 words (~120), and avoids prohibited topics. Actions are concrete and logically tied to waiting-time reductions.

However, strict deductions apply for deviations from ground truth and prompt:
- **Actions lack "data-driven" specificity**: No references to pilots, estimates, or data (e.g., ground truth cites "pilot tests show ≥25%," "estimated 30%"). LLM actions are logical but unsupported by data, violating "data-driven" requirement (-1.0).
- **No per-activity ≥20% claim**: Prompt requires each action to "cut its waiting time by ≥20%"; LLM only has a collective summary ("20-40%"), plus unsubstantiated "within 90 days" (-0.5).
- **Format differences**: Elaborate memo structure vs. ground truth's concise bullets adds fluff (e.g., "Immediate Action Required"), slightly inflating length and diverging from crispness (-0.5).

Core correctness is strong (per scoring notes), but these errors warrant significant loss under utmost strictness.
