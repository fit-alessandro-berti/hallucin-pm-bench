8.0

The LLM answer is generally strong and matches ground truth on the three activities, correct ranking, and waiting time values. However, there are several areas of deviation and minor error, leading to a notable point deduction:

- **Correctness of Activities and Order:** The three activities and ranking exactly match the ground truth: #1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability.
- **Waiting Time Figures:** The averages and 95th-percentiles are quoted accurately from the table.
- **No Unwarranted Activities/Service-Time:** The memo does not discuss any other activities or non-waiting metrics, as required.
- **Action Recommendations:**
    - All actions are broadly relevant, but are either more general or more speculative than the ground truth (e.g., "implement automated document request system" is less specific and not supported by a cited pilot result, "deploy auto-generation for standard closure letters" lacks specificity about batch printing and e-signatures, "specialized fast-track queue" is similar in intent to pre-classification but less precise).
    - None of the actions *explicitly* mention the ≥20% reduction or cite supporting evidence (e.g., pilot, estimates, targets), whereas the ground truth does for all.
- **Memo Length and Formatting:** Memo is within 150 words and properly structured.
- **Minor Faults:** The phrase "These targeted interventions should reduce waiting times by 20-40% within 90 days of implementation" invents a quantitative projection not in the ground truth or table, and thus introduces an unsupported claim.

**Strict Scoring Justification:**  
Full points would require each action to be as specific and evidence-based as the ground truth (explicit reduction target, supporting detail, e.g. "pilot shows ≥25%", "estimated 30% reduction"). The offered actions, while plausible, lack these anchors. The minor claim at the end about "20-40%...within 90 days" is a small overstep. These small errors and lack of alignment with the supporting data called for by the ground truth amount to a loss of 2 points.

**Final Score:** 8.0
