**9.2**

The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the exact same XML modification as the ground truth (changing `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" on the identical element), fully complying with rules (one attribute change, no add/delete, no flow reversal). The rationale is a concise one-sentence explanation that accurately justifies the SLA improvement via duration reduction, semantically equivalent to the ground truth's focus on fitting a 3-day SLA. Minor deductions for: (1) standard unified diff extras (file headers `---/+++`, line numbers `@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@`, 5 extra context lines vs. ground truth's ultra-minimal 0-context `@ @` hunk), slightly deviating from the "single hunk" minimalism; (2) lacking ground truth's bolding/formatting and exact phrasing (e.g., no "contractual 3-day SLA" or "without introducing any new activities"); (3) no top-level headings like "## **Expected answer**". Under utmost strictness, these format/wording diffs warrant ~0.8-point loss from 10.0 despite perfect functional match.
