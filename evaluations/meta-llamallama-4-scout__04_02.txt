3.5

Rationale:

- R1: Correct (Compliant, justification OK).
- R2: Incorrect. The LLM considers the "last required approval" as the Finance_Approval, but per R5, a new Manager_Approval is required after a Change_Request before any further step. The correct last required approval should be the second Manager_Approval (07-Mar). Ship_Goods (05-Mar) is before this approval, so the rule is **Violated**, not Compliant. Major error.
- R3: Correctly identified as Violated; justification is good.
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable).
- R5: Incorrect. The LLM marks this as Compliant, but Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice both occur after the Change_Request (04-Mar) but before the required new Manager_Approval (07-Mar), thus Violated. Major error.
- R6: Correct (Compliant).

- The LLM overall result (**NON-COMPLIANT**) matches ground truth, but the rule-level analysis is significantly wrong: R2 and R5 marked as Compliant when both are Violated. These are critical misinterpretations of dependencies caused by the Change_Request and subsequent required approvals, meaning the analysis fails to catch the processâ€™s key compliance violations.

- Although presentation and summary structure are clear, systematic misinterpretation of rules and event order (especially dependencies introduced by R5) represent severe evaluation failures.

**A strict assessment yields a score of 3.5/10. Errors on R2 and R5 are too significant for anything higher, despite some correct points.**
