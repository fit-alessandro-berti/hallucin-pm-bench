### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies compliance for R1, R3, R4, and R6, and the overall NON-COMPLIANT result, but commits major errors in R2 (incorrectly Compliant; misses that Change_Request resets the "last required approval" to the 2025-03-07 Manager_Approval, making Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 violate the 2-day post-approval rule) and R5 (incorrectly Compliant; ignores that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occur as "further processing steps" before the new Manager_Approval). These are substantive misinterpretations of rule dependencies and event sequencing, leading to under-detection of violations. Format deviates from prompt (elaborate sections instead of concise â‰¤20-word justifications per rule; some explanations exceed limit). Under strict criteria, two critical rule errors (out of six) warrant a low score, despite partial alignment.
