The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with correct identification of all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). However, under strict evaluation, the minor formatting difference in spacing after the colon in "Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel" (LLM has no extra spaces, while ground truth appears to have alignment spaces) constitutes a small but verifiable discrepancy in output format, warranting a deduction. No other errors or omissions.
