9.2

The LLM answer is factually correct, provides the exact minimal sequence (T1,T2,T7,T4,T5) matching ground truth, and includes a concise, accurate verbal demonstration under 120 words. It correctly answers Q1 as "Yes" and shows T5 fires with P2/P5 available pre-T3.

Deductions (-0.8): 
- Lacks explicit markings (e.g., M1={P1,P2}, M4={P2,P5}) for rigorous state verification, present in ground truth.
- Explanation prose-only vs. ground truth's structured Q1 brief + numbered Q2 list with bolded transitions and final confirmation note.
- Minor header diffs (Question vs. Q) and unnumbered list.

High score reflects core match; strictness penalizes detail/format gaps.
