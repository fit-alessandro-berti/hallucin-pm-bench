The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the prompt by starting with "No" and providing a single-paragraph justification that correctly cites the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11 lacking Receive_Order), with no factual errors, omissions, or extraneous information beyond helpful timestamps. Stylistic differences (e.g., bolding, semicolon structure vs. bullets) do not detract from content equivalence to the ground truth.
