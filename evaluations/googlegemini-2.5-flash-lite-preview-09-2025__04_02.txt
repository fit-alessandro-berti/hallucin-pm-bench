3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Format Compliance**: The LLM answer partially follows the required structure (status + justification per rule, all-caps overall result), but adds unnecessary "Analysis" preambles and bolding that deviates slightly from "say **Compliant**, **Violated**, or **Not Applicable**, followed by ≤ 20-word justification." Justifications are mostly ≤20 words but not strictly concise or exact. Minor deduction (-0.5).
- **R1**: Status matches (Compliant); justification similar but not identical (e.g., LLM emphasizes "sequentially" vs. ground truth's "present"). Minor wording difference, but correct. Full points here.
- **R2**: Status wrong (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores the Change_Request triggering a new approval on 2025-03-07, misidentifying the "last required approval" as 2025-03-04. Fails to recognize Ship_Goods timing relative to post-change approval. Major error (-2.0).
- **R3**: Status matches (Violated); justification accurate and concise, aligning closely with ground truth. Full points.
- **R4**: Status matches (Not Applicable); justification equivalent. Full points.
- **R5**: Status wrong (Compliant vs. Violated); justification overlooks that Ship_Goods (Event 5) and Pay_Invoice (Event 7) are "further processing steps" occurring before the new Manager_Approval (Event 8), directly violating the rule. Major error (-2.0).
- **R6**: Status matches (Compliant); justification equivalent. Full points.
- **Overall Result**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT), but LLM identifies only one violation (R3) while ground truth has three (R2, R3, R5), understating non-compliance severity. Partial credit.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Two critical rule misclassifications (R2, R5) with flawed reasoning represent ~33% error rate on core task; even partial correctness elsewhere doesn't offset, per instructions for significant loss on errors. Base score ~5.0 reduced to 3.0 for substantive inaccuracies.
