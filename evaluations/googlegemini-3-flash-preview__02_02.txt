**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict line-by-line assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Q1 (A1)**: Matches "3" factually, but adds unasked extra "(C001, C002, and C003)" and sentence structure. Minor extra → deduct 1 point (9/10).
- **Q2 (A2)**: Exact match on sequence, formatting, and content (underscores, arrows, order). Perfect (10/10).
- **Q3 (A3)**: Correct distinct activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), correctly alphabetized, listed one per line. However, adds substantial unasked extras "(Precedes Ship_Order in C002)" and case specifics, plus different bullet style (* vs. -). Treated as extras/"hallucinations" per instructions → significant deduct (6/10).
- **Overall structure**: Adds intro sentence and bolding not in ground truth table format; minor deduct.
- **Total**: Weighted average ~8.0. No factual errors/missing elements, but strict penalty for extras and non-exact formatting/presentational differences.
