3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks (partial credit, 2/3 points)**: Correctly identifies `check_vip` and `generate_qr` by ID, but fails to use full element details (names) as in ground truth ("Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)", etc.). Prompt requires "element names exactly as they appear in the XML" – IDs alone are incomplete vs. ground truth's name+ID format. Bullet style differs slightly.
- **Removed tasks (0/3 points)**: Major error – incorrectly states "(none)" despite `send_rma_label` ("Send RMA Label") clearly absent in v2 but present in v1. This is a factual omission directly contradicting XML and ground truth.
- **Gateway type changes (1/3 points)**: Correctly notes change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway, but omits specific ID (`gw_valid`) and versioning (v1/v2) as in ground truth. Vague phrasing ("Exclusive gateway...") vs. exact tags.
- **Format/Structure (-1 point penalty)**: Headings use **bold** + colons (:) instead of exact prompt spec ("• Added tasks" etc.). No "(none)" where applicable beyond error. Overall, significant content diffs (esp. missed removal) warrant low score despite partial accuracies. Total: 3.0 (strict deduction for errors/omissions).
