The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate/not accurate), coverage of all three cases, and evidence-based justification citing case IDs and activities. It correctly identifies reversed ordering in cases 1001 and 1003, absence in 1002, and intervening activity in 1003 (implying lack of immediacy). Minor deductions for lacking structured headers, line references, and a slightly awkward phrasing in case 1003 ("not after"), which reduces precision without altering the core correctness.
