7.5

**Evaluation Rationale** (strict assessment vs. ground truth and prompt):

- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match—#1 Request_Documents (36.5h/120.0h), #2 Send_Closure_Letter (12.2h/44.0h), #3 Assess_Liability (7.8h/16.4h). Exact quotes, correct ranking by avg wait. (+10/10)
- **No unwarranted content**: Violates by including throughput figures (275/255/310 executions) in actions, explicitly forbidden ("no ... throughput"). No service times/other activities. (-2.0)
- **Action relevance**: Concrete, logically tied to waits, data-driven via precise ≥20% calcs (e.g., ≤29.2h = 36.5×0.8). Promises met, no unsupported invention beyond table-derived math. But fully divergent from ground truth actions/wording. (-0.5)
- **Format/length**: Crisp memo ≤150 words (98), professional header enhances "executive memo" vs. ground truth's bare list. Minor plus, but differences in structure/style. (0)
- **Overall differences**: Core identical, but throughput inclusion (violation), divergent actions/specifics reduce similarity. Strict deducts for extras/errors yield 7.5.
