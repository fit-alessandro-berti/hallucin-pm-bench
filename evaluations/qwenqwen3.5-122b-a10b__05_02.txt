**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Diff (major match, minor format differences):** Both target the exact same element (`Task_CollectEquipment` `camunda:dueDate`), identical line content/context, proper single-hunk unified diff structure; LLM uses valid `@@ -10,5 +10,5 @@` (accurate per XML line count), while ground truth uses malformed `@@` without line numbers/context—LLM superior here (+0.5 relative). Deduct 0.5 for extra context lines not in ground truth.
- **Change value (significant error):** P1D vs. P2D is a clear mismatch in the core modification (-2.0; strict per instructions—wrong attribute value is not minor).
- **Rationale (partial match):** Correctly identifies same task/bottleneck, reduction rationale, no new activities; deducts for wrong days (P1D/P5D vs. 5-to-2), vague "standard SLA targets" vs. specific "3-day SLA", missing bolding/formatting, wordier phrasing (-1.0).
- **Overall compliance:** Perfectly follows rules (one attribute mod, no add/delete, exact output format), logical improvement—base 10.0, total deductions -3.0.
