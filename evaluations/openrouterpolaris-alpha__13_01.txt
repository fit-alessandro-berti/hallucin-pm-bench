9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match in content (1 occurrence confirmed from log lines 7-8 for case A1002). Minor deduction for unnecessary introductory phrasing ("Count of ... : - "), which deviates slightly from the concise ground truth format. (-0.2 points)
- **Question 2**: Perfect match, including calculation and rounding to two decimals (5.56%). No deviations. (+2.0 points, full credit)
- **Question 3**: Correctly identifies the sole case (A1002, from log lines). Lists it accurately per prompt instruction to "list the case identifier(s)". However, ground truth explicitly states "Only case A1002 contains...", adding emphasis on singularity; LLM omits this phrasing, making it slightly less precise. (-0.3 points)
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, valid reasons directly aligning with ground truth examples (small sample size with variance explanation; temporal bias with single-day limitation and monthly non-representativeness). No hallucinations or inferences beyond log. Fully satisfies "any two" criterion without errors. (+2.0 points, full credit)

**Overall**: The response is highly accurate, with all facts derived strictly from the 18 log lines and no assumptions. Total deductions are minimal for phrasing/formatting inconsistencies, but strict evaluation penalizes any non-identical wording. Base score 10.0 minus 0.5 = 9.5.
