6.5

### Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Part 1 (40% weight)**: Perfect match (exact count of 1/"once"). +10/10.
- **Part 2 (60% weight)**: Captures core idea of small sample (3 cases, ~1 hour) risking misestimation of frequency/proportion (+4). Concise and under 120 words (+1). But major deductions for: no quantification (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours, 0%-7% swing, confidence interval, rare-event sampling error: -2); ignores data-evident near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and strict/fuzzy matching risks (-2); mild speculation on "workloads/case mixes/triggering rules" violating "no speculation" rule (-1). Superficial vs. ground truth's precise, data-grounded analysis. Total: 2/10 → weighted 1.2.
- **Overall**: 10*0.4 + 2*0.6 = 6.5. Strict per instructions—content/insight gaps are substantial differences.
