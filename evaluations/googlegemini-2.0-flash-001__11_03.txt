8.0

The LLM answer is clearly grounded in the supplied data and correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times. It quantifies by how much each activity exceeds its SLA, directly referencing throughput times and their overages, as shown in the table. The recommendations are concrete, match each activity, and refer to the contained data (case counts, waiting times), and are provided in bullet point form as required.

However, there are some notable errors and omissions compared to the ground truth, which warrant a significant deduction, in line with the request for strictness:

- The original instruction asks for ≈150 words, and the memo (excluding heading/dates) stretches this slightly (~180 words), partly due to a more verbose introduction and sign-off.
- The recommendations, while data-driven, are noticeably less precise and actionable than the ground truth. The ground truth recommends, for example, "rule-based pre-checks" and adding "one risk analyst to the peak morning window," while the LLM gives more generic actions like "reallocate resources" or "implement a parallel-processing system."
- The LLM answer omits the overall case volume summary and the impact statement (“Implementing these changes is projected to reduce...”) present in the ground truth.
- The LLM does not mention specific actionable details such as the “loans under €25k” threshold or “straight-through” heuristics.
- The LLM refers to dates (“October 21, 2024”) not present in the prompt or ground truth and formats the memo heading differently.
- There’s a minor inaccuracy in the number of cases per activity: the sum of “cases” (reported one per row in the table) is not described as part of overall analysis as in the ground truth (“4 805 completed cases”).

Given these issues—primarily the loss of substance and precision in recommendations, omission of impact, extra memo header details, and absence of specific improvements suggested by the ground truth—a deduction of 2 points reflects the significant yet non-disqualifying nature of the differences. The LLM answer is solidly grounded but clearly less actionable and precise than the benchmark.
