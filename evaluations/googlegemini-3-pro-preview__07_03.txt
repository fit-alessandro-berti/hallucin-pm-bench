The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with correct identification of all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the single removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). Headings and formatting are consistent with the prompt's requirements and example. The sole difference is minor whitespace inconsistency in the second gateway line (ground truth has extra spaces after the colon for apparent alignment, while LLM omits them, matching the prompt's example more closely). Under utmost strictness, this small formatting discrepancy warrants a deduction, but the response remains highly accurate overall.
