4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt's requirements but exhibits numerous significant differences from the ground truth, warranting a moderately low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: 
  - Missing "Operations Manager" column, which is present in the ground truth. This omits assignments for a key role, making the table incomplete relative to the ground truth.
  - Extra rows for "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archive completion," which are not in the ground truth (SWIFT is implicitly part of "Release Payment," and notification is handled via "I" in "Archive Record"). This adds unsubstantiated granularity, deviating from the ground truth's 6 tasks.
  - No "Legend" section, unlike the ground truth.
  - Header row differs: LLM uses simple "Task," while ground truth specifies "Task / Activity (mandated wording)."
  - No post-table explanatory notes in LLM, unlike ground truth's confirmation of vocabulary adherence.

- **Task Wording and Coverage (Moderate Deduction: -1.5 points)**:
  - Tasks are mostly mapped from the source but not identically phrased or organized. Examples: LLM's "Receive transfer instruction and log in the system" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM splits and expands (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" adds details not in ground truth's concise "**KYC Review**"). The ground truth uses mandated wording more precisely and concisely, with bolding for emphasis (e.g., "**KYC Review**").
  - Covers all source elements but introduces separation (SWIFT, notification) not present in ground truth, leading to over-coverage.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -1.5 points)**:
  - Assignments frequently mismatch. Examples:
    - "Receive...": LLM assigns TA as R/A only; ground truth spreads R (TA), A (Operations Manager), C (IT Support), I (Regulatory Liaison).
    - "Screen...": Partial match (TA R, Regulatory Liaison A), but misses Operations Manager I and IT Support C.
    - "KYC Review": Close but differs (LLM: Regulatory Liaison R/A, TA C, IT Support I; ground truth: Regulatory Liaison R, Operations Manager A, TA C, IT Support I). LLM combines R/A incorrectly for strict RACI separation.
    - "Approve...": LLM TA I vs. ground truth TA C; extra IT Support I in LLM.
    - "Release...": Similar but LLM TA R/A vs. ground truth TA R / Operations Manager A.
    - "Archive...": LLM lacks TA C; ground truth includes it explicitly.
  - Use of combined "R/A" in cells deviates from ground truth's separate bolded indicators (e.g., **R**, **A**), which is a formatting and conceptual error.

- **Vocabulary and Prompt Adherence (Minor Credit: +1.0 point)**:
  - Correctly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions, aligning with the prompt and partially with ground truth.
  - Markdown table is present and clear, covering source tasks without omissions (though with extras).

Overall, while the LLM answer is functional and prompt-compliant in vocabulary and format, the extensive mismatches in roles, tasks, assignments, and structure result in only partial fidelity to the ground truth. Small errors (e.g., no bolding, combined R/A) compound to significant deviations, justifying deductions for strictness. A score above 5.0 would require near-exact replication.
