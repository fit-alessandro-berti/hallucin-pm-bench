3.0

### Reasoning:
- **Core idea similarity (+3.0 base)**: Both suggest an interrupting boundary timer event attached to an existing task, with a flow to `Task_Triage` to bypass delays and enforce SLA. Concise plain English, <120 words, references IDs.
- **Major differences (strict deductions)**:
  - **Wrong attachment point**: `Task_RequestDocs` vs. ground truth `Task_Receive` (-2.5). Fundamentally different element, alters bypass logic (only affects doc-missing path vs. early path).
  - **Timer specification mismatch**: Vague "deadline = `Start_Claim` time + 48h" (requires unmentioned variable/expression) vs. explicit `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>` (-2.0).
  - **No new IDs/XML details**: Lacks `id="Timer_48h"`, new sequenceFlow description (-1.0).
  - **Hedged routing**: "escalation end event (or directly to `Task_Triage`)" introduces potential new end event vs. precise "new sequenceFlow ... to existing `Task_Triage`" (-1.0).
  - **Explanation inaccuracy**: Claims enforcement for "any claim ... by 48 hours" but timer on `Task_RequestDocs` doesn't cover full path/from-submission timing (-0.5).

Total differences too significant for higher score under utmost strictness.
