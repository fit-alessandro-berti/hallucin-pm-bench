### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deviations, ~50% Penalty)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 precise decision points with explicit branching logic (e.g., eligible/not eligible leading to rejection; amount threshold >€1,000/≤€1,000; final approval approved/rejected). The LLM answer lists 5 items, but only #3 accurately matches a decision (threshold). #1 and #2 are descriptive steps without rejection branches or outcomes (omitting "claim rejected/returned" and process end without payment). #4 and #5 are not decisions—they are sequential constraints/outcomes (payment execution and confirmation are automatic post-approval, not branching points). This introduces extraneous non-decision elements, dilutes focus, and ignores failure paths, violating the prompt's call for "every decision point" with strict summarization. No table or structured logic as in ground truth, reducing clarity and fidelity.
  
- **Required Documents (Moderate Deviations, ~30% Penalty)**: The LLM lists 6 documents, missing *RefundConfirmationPDF* entirely (a core artefact from step 6, explicitly "required" in the process for completion). It correctly includes conditionals for *AuditTrail* but phrases it as "required only if" without noting it's "part of the catalogue" (as in ground truth), slightly underemphasizing its process role. No extraneous introductions, but incompleteness is a critical error under strict rules—no partial credit for near-misses.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor but Cumulative Errors, ~20% Penalty)**: Rephrasing (e.g., "Eligibility Validation" instead of exact activity name *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*) introduces subtle deviations. No mention of legacy activity exclusion (as prompted/ground truth). Response is concise but structurally mismatched (bullets vs. table/list), and assumes linear success without ground truth's emphasis on rejections/ends. Small errors compound: no exact match in wording, completeness, or exhaustive branching, warranting severe deduction per instructions.

This score reflects utmost strictness: the LLM captures ~60% of core content but with transformative errors in accuracy, completeness, and focus, far from ground truth equivalence.
