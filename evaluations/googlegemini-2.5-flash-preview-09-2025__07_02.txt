8.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all key changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the precise gateway type change), matching the ground truth content without factual errors, omissions, or additions. It ignores cosmetic elements (e.g., task name changes like "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name changes, or flow renamings) as instructed.

However, under strict evaluation criteria, deduct points for the following differences, which introduce minor but noticeable deviations:
- **Formatting inconsistency (significant deduction: -1.0)**: Uses a table structure instead of the ground truth's bulleted/numbered lists under plain headings. While functional, this alters the expected direct, list-based presentation and adds unnecessary markdown elements (e.g., table pipes and rows), violating the "strictly under the three requested headings" emphasis on simplicity.
- **Presentation of tasks (minor deductions: -0.25 each, total -0.5)**: For added and removed tasks, reverses the order (ID first with **bold**, name in quotes) compared to ground truth (name bold first, ID in backticks). Lists without numbering, differing from ground truth's enumerated style. These are small stylistic errors but warrant point loss per strictness rules.
- **Gateway wording and extras (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Includes XML tag references (e.g., `exclusiveGateway`) and full phrases ("Exclusive Gateway"), which are accurate but extraneous and not in ground truth. Omits version references ("in *v1*" and "*v2*") and abbreviations like "XOR/OR". Lacks the ground truth's closing note ("No other..."), though this is not required.
- **Introductory text (minor deduction: -0.25)**: Adds an unprompted preamble ("As a meticulous... specified headings"), which deviates from the direct start in ground truth and prompt's "strictly" directive.

No major content errors, so base score starts high (10.0 potential), with deductions only for presentation/style mismatches. Total deductions: -1.5 from 10.0, but adjusted upward slightly to 8.5 for overall fidelity to the task.
