9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two required pairs from Process B, lists them in the proper alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format. However, it deducts a full point for including unnecessary introductory text ("Here's a list... as requested:"), which deviates from the prompt's instruction to output one pair per line without additional content, as mirrored strictly in the ground truth (which begins directly with the pairs). Minor potential formatting inconsistencies in spacing/alignment (e.g., the ground truth appears to use extra spaces for visual alignment in the second pair, while the LLM uses standard spacing) are noted but do not further impact the score, as they are not substantive errors in content. No other differences exist, confirming the pairs' accuracy and completeness per the rationale.
