The LLM answer is correct in terms of substance: both listed pairs are indeed the only pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel, according to the given process description.

However, there are minor formatting issues that warrant a deduction:

1. The pairs are listed with a single space between task names (e.g., `Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`), whereas the ground truth uses *aligned formatting* with extra space to ensure both sides visually line up (`Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines`). The prompt does not explicitly require this alignment, but it does ask for "alphabetical order" and a specific output format. However, the LLM reproduces the line format (single space between task names and em-dash separating), which is acceptable and not explicitly wrong.

2. The LLM omits the ``` code block wrapper shown in the ground truth output, though this is not strictly required by the prompt.

Given the utmost strictness required and the instruction that even small errors should result in significant loss of points, the lack of code block formatting and the minor space misalignment (which affects the output's neatness and readability) justify the deduction of 1 full point. If the prompt had required the code block or strict visual alignment, a larger deduction would be warranted.

Therefore, the answer earns a **9.0**.
