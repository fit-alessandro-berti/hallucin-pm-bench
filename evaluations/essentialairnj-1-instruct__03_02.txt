**2.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in schema (custom task-list with implicit flows vs. explicit elements/flows), BPMN fidelity (no exclusiveGateway for classification routing, no parallelGateway/fork-join for log/send, incorrect event types like Message task-join hybrid and TimerThrowEvent, inconsistent incoming/outgoing definitions, direct Timeout-to-Close bypassing sequential reminder), extra hallucinated task (ParseEmail), flawed terminate (misused BoundaryEvent with invalid multi-incoming), absent proper eventBasedGateway/timer/messageCatch for 24h wait, no endEvents, no flow conditions, and logical errors (e.g., Timeout splits to parallel reminder/close, CustomerReply precedes Timeout). Even minor inconsistencies (e.g., unlisted SendReminder incoming on CloseTicket) compound failures. Minimal alignment on task names/sequence only.
