**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct status and similar justifications for R1, R3, R4, R5, R6. Overall result matches (NON-COMPLIANT).
- **Major errors (significant deductions under strictness)**:
  - R2: Wrong status (Compliant in table/summary vs. ground truth Violated); incorrect justification (ignores post-change approval as "last required," claims timing met); internal inconsistency (text says "Violated" but table "Compliant").
  - Misses R2 in "critical violations" list.
- **Format/Structure issues**: Adds unrequired headings, summary table, extra explanations (e.g., "see R5 interaction"); deviates from simple per-rule bold status + ≤20-word justification + overall conclusion.
- **Minor issues**: R5 justification omits Pay_Invoice (ground truth includes it); word counts ok but not exact matches.
- **Overall**: One core rule fully mismatched + inconsistency + format bloat = substantial deviation from ground truth (~30% error rate), warranting mid-low score despite mostly correct rules.
