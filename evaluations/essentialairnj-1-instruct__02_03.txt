**6.0**

- **Q1 major error**: Incorrect count (4 vs. 3); false claim "each event tag has unique case value"; missing case list (C123, C456, C789); not concise.
- **Q2 correct**: Matches "Pack_Items" (chronologically precedes Ship_Order for C456).
- **Q3 correct**: Matches "Cancel_Order" (appears once).
- **Format**: Numbered list vs. requested bullets; extra verbiage reduces conciseness. Overall: 2/3 accurate but strict deduction for Q1 inaccuracy and extras yields 6.0.
