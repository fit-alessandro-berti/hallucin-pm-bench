The LLM answer violates the core rule of proposing exactly ONE SLA-compliance improvement by modifying three separate dueDate attributes, resulting in multiple changes instead of a single targeted adjustment; the diff, while in unified format, incorporates these extraneous modifications in one hunk, and the rationale incorrectly justifies multiple alterations without addressing the implied 3-day SLA bottleneck (the 5-day Collect Equipment task) as in the ground truth, making it fundamentally non-compliant and earning the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
