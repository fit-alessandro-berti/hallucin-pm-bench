The LLM answer is mostly accurate but has a critical error on R2 (incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated, with flawed justification ignoring the new Manager_Approval as the final required approval post-Change_Request). Statuses correct for R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 (5/6). Justifications are concise (≤20 words) and similar except R2 (wrong) and minor differences in R5 (omits Pay_Invoice). Format close to prompt but statuses not bolded as **Compliant** etc. Overall correct despite error. Strict deduction for major R2 mismatch.
