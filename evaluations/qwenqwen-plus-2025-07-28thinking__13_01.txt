7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
This score reflects a strict assessment prioritizing fidelity to the ground truth across all questions, with the LLM answer losing substantial points for the critical error in question 2 (miscounting total events as 17 instead of 18, leading to an incorrect percentage of 5.88% vs. 5.56%). This is a fundamental deviation, indicating a failure to accurately parse the provided log lines, which violates the "no assumptions" rule and constitutes a hallucination. Questions 1, 3, and 4 are accurate and well-supported, but the quantitative error in 2 (affecting ~25% of the evaluation weight) results in a significant deduction. Minor strengths like clear explanations do not offset this.

- **Question 1**: 10.0 (Exact match: correctly identifies 1 occurrence with accurate explanation.)
- **Question 2**: 0.0 (Major error: Wrong total events (17 vs. 18) and percentage (5.88% vs. 5.56%); explanation explicitly justifies the miscount, showing misinterpretation of the 18 log lines.)
- **Question 3**: 10.0 (Exact match: Correctly lists A1002 with accurate explanation.)
- **Question 4**: 10.0 (Strong match: Provides two valid, clearly stated sampling reasons—small sample size and temporal bias—that align directly with ground truth options without extraneous inference.)
