7.0

1. **Event count:** Correctly states "1", matching the ground truth.

2. **Percentage calculation:** The LLM answers 5.88% (1 ÷ 17), but the fragment is 18 events (including header it’s 19, but the header must be excluded). The correct denominator is 18, so correct answer is 5.56%. The 1-event numerator is correct, but using 17 as total events is wrong—this is a significant but not catastrophic error. (−1.5 points)

3. **Case identifiers:** Correctly identifies A1002.

4. **Sampling reasons:** The reasoning is solid and consistent with the sample size and temporal coverage points. It misses case-mix or survivorship bias, but this was not required; the two points given are legitimate. The LLM discusses high variability due to small sample size and poor temporal representativeness, which is accurate and faithful to the data (no hallucinations, and grounded only in what’s observable). Small deduction for not mentioning case-mix or survivorship bias, but these were not required for full credit as per the ground truth (“any two”).

**Major deductions:**  
- Very notable error in percentage calculation (using 17 instead of 18), which would result in a different interpretation in some business contexts.
- Minor: percentage is correct to two decimal places for their incorrect denominator, but the denominator itself is wrong.

**Minor deduction**: explanations are otherwise precise and don’t include any information not present in the fragment.

**Summary deductions:**  
- −1.5 point for denominator error in Q2  
- −0.5 for not specifically calling out possible case-mix or truncation bias, but the two reasons provided are both direct and accepted by the ground truth.

**Total: 7.0**
