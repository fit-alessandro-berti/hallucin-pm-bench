7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence correctly identified with reference to Case 1002). Full credit: 10/10.
- **Part 2**: Covers small sample size (3 cases/1 day) and naming inconsistencies, aligning partially with ground truth. However, under strict criteria: (1) Less precise (omits event count=14, <2-hour span; uses "1 day" which is accurate but vague); (2) Introduces speculation (e.g., "time-bound fraud patterns," "hidden business rules," "correlation with manual review") violating "no speculation" rule; (3) Misses key ground truth elements like sampling error quantification (e.g., 0%-7% swing, wide confidence intervals) and risks of strict vs. fuzzy matching; (4) Word count is under 120 but explanation is wordy on non-data elements. Significant deductions for deviations: 5/10.
- **Overall**: Strong on accuracy of count but flawed explanation reduces total. Minor precision issues and speculation cause notable point loss per instructions.
