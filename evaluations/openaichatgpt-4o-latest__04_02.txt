The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall NON-COMPLIANT status and handles R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6 accurately in status and justification (all within format and word limits, with minor phrasing variations but no factual errors). However, R2 is critically flawed: it incorrectly marks Compliant instead of Violated, with a justification that ignores the Change_Request's impact on requiring a new approval (on 2025-03-07), misapplying the 2-day rule to the initial Finance_Approval. This major interpretive error—missing a key violation—warrants a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria, as it substantially deviates from the ground truth.
