7.5

R1: Correct status and justification.
R2: Incorrectly marked as compliantâ€”in reality, final approval after Change_Request was on 07-Mar, so Ship_Goods (05-Mar) falls outside the required window after the necessary new approval (should be Violated). 
R3: Correct status and clear justification.
R4: Correct.
R5: Correct status and clear justification.
R6: Correct.
Overall result: Correct.

While the answer demonstrates a mostly strong understanding, the R2 error is substantial, as it fails to recognize that the 2-day window is counted relative to the new (post-Change_Request) Manager_Approval. The justification for R1 could be slightly clearer, but is acceptable. Due to this, a significant but not devastating penalty is merited for the R2 error, and small further deductions for not explicitly stating the "final approval after change" in any justification.
