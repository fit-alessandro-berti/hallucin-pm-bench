9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both parallel sets in Process B, accurately grouping the tasks under each parallel split. The numbering is correct, and only Process B is addressed, as instructed.

However, there are minor differences compared to the ground truth that should result in point loss due to strictness:

- The LLM answer uses slightly less explicit labeling for the parallel blocks (“Set 1”/“Set 2” vs. “Set 1 – first parallel block”).
- Task separation is presented as bullet points rather than with the “‖” notation.
- The explicit note “No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel.” from the ground truth is missing.

While factually complete, these stylistic and completeness differences justify a deduction. Thus, the appropriate strict score is **9.0**.
