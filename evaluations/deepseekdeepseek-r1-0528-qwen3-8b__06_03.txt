7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets from Process B, matching the core content of the ground truth (the exact tasks and their grouping/order). It adheres to the prompt by focusing solely on Process B, numbering the sets in sequence, and excluding any mention of Processes A or C. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Formatting and phrasing differences (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: The ground truth uses a precise structure with inline notation (`‖` for parallelism), labels like "Set 1 – first parallel block:", and bolding only for set names. The LLM uses a more verbose intro ("Okay, focusing solely on..."), bullet points instead of inline lists, markdown italics/bolding inconsistently, and simpler "Set 1:" labels without specifying "parallel block" descriptors. This deviates from the ground truth's concise, structured format.
  
- **Extra/omitted content (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: The LLM adds an unnecessary introductory phrase ("Okay, focusing solely on...") and a header-like explanation ("Each set of tasks executing concurrently due to a parallel construct:"), which aren't in the ground truth. It also omits the ground truth's closing sentence ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel."), making it less comprehensive despite the prompt not explicitly requiring it.

No factual errors in task identification, but these presentational mismatches and minor verbosity reduce the score from a potential 10.0. A perfect match would require near-verbatim replication of the ground truth's style and completeness.
