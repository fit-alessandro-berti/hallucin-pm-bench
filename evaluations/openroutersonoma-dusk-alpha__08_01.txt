The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, asserting "No" with a flawed proof that misstates markings (e.g., claiming p4=1 after T1 when p4=0; ignoring the path firing T2 before T3 enables T5). This directly contradicts the ground truth's "Yes," supported by a valid sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3). The error in yes/no alone warrants minimal score under strict criteria; additional logical gaps (e.g., not exploring reachable states post-T2) compound the failure.
