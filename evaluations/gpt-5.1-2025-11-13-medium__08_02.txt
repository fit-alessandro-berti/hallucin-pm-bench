The LLM answer correctly answers Q1 with "Yes" and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) as the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3 without T3 occurring. It accurately explains postponing T3 via the alternative path, staying within the word limit. Minor deductions for lacking intermediate markings (M₁–M₅) and not explicitly noting T5's consumption of the P2 token (disabling T3 subsequently), which adds confirmatory detail in the ground truth. These omissions are small but, per strict criteria, warrant a slight point loss despite overall equivalence in logic and completeness.
