The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a near-minimal score under strict evaluation criteria. It correctly employs the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without forbidden variants, earning minimal credit there. However, the output is not a coherent RACI matrix: it provides only a partial, broken table (covering just the first three activities incompletely, with Payment Clearance row garbled and marked with an erroneous "❌ Correction"), then devolves into an excessively long, unwarranted prose explanation filled with self-doubts, rationalizations, hypothetical reassignments, and discussions of "best practices" or "ambiguities" not present in the prompt or narrative. No complete, finalized matrix is delivered, violating the core task of producing a clean RACI matrix (activities as rows, roles as columns).

RACI allocations in the partial table starkly mismatch the ground truth:
- Receive Application: LLM assigns only AM=R (others blank); ground truth has AM=R/A, CO=C, FC=I, IT=I.
- KYC Review: LLM assigns only CO=R (others blank); ground truth has AM=A, CO=R, FC=C, IT=I.
- Order Vetting: LLM assigns only AM=R (others blank); ground truth has AM=R/A, CO=C, FC=I, IT=I.
- Payment Clearance: LLM's row is malformed (e.g., "R A I C" jumbled across roles) with no stable assignments; ground truth has AM=A, CO=C, FC=R, IT=I.
- Entirely omits Record Update and Notify Customer rows, which ground truth includes with precise allocations (e.g., IT=R for Record Update, AM=R/A for Notify Customer).

The narrative-driven allocations (e.g., exactly one Responsible per activity, AM as Accountable where appropriate) are ignored in favor of simplistic or inconsistent minimalism. Unwarranted content dominates (e.g., extended footnotes on RACI standards, reassignment logic, industry conventions), introducing extra "tasks" like interpretive notes and failing the rubric's prohibition on extraneous elements. No self-awareness issues apply, but overall, this is a non-responsive, error-ridden output with zero fidelity to the ground truth's clean, complete format and specifics—small errors like blank cells compound into total structural collapse, justifying severe deduction.
