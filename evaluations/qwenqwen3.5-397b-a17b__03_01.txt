**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer captures the **exact topology and flow connectivity** of the ground truth (100% match on sequenceFlow source/target refs, element order, loop to t3, direct t2→t6, t5→t4, three exclusiveGateways despite prompt mentioning "two"). No hallucinations (no added timers, tasks, parallels, etc.). Concise IDs used (s1/t1/gw1 etc.). Line count ~25 (<40). Task names match quoted text perfectly except t1 ("Classify Ticket" vs ground "Auto-Classification"—small invention, but both reasonable).

**Significant deductions (-3.0 total)**:
- **No conditionExpressions on decision flows** (major semantic error: 6 flows f3/f4/f7/f8/f12/f13 use flow `name=` labels instead of `<conditionExpression xsi:type="tFormalExpression">yes/no</conditionExpression>`; BPMN decisions require conditions for proper execution/orchestration. Flow names are descriptive but not functional equivalents. Missing `xmlns:xsi` declaration exacerbates. -2.0).
- Task t1 name mismatch ("Classify Ticket" ≠ "Auto-Classification"). -0.5.
- Missing/partial element names/attrs (no gw names like "Password Reset?", no start/end names, no process `name`/ `isExecutable`; different process `id`/`targetNamespace`). -0.5.

**Minor deductions (-0.5 total)**:
- Missing `<?xml declaration?>`. -0.3.
- Flow `name=` attrs descriptive but diverge from ground's no-names + conditions. -0.2.

Perfect structure outweighs details under strictness, but functional/condition gaps prevent 10.0. Equivalent to ~70% XML/ semantic fidelity.
