3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer with utmost strictness against the ground truth, penalizing all differences—including omissions, additions, inaccuracies, and structural mismatches—severely, even if minor. The assessment is broken down by part for transparency, leading to an overall score reflecting substantial cumulative deficiencies.

#### Part (a): Summary of Decision Points
- **Ground Truth**: Identifies exactly two decision points: (1) the post-Tri-Color-Risk-Check conditional skip (precise rule: "Low or Medium *and* ≤ €250 000" bypasses step 5; otherwise proceeds); (2) TriVote gate (at least two of three specific approvers record “Approve” to advance).
- **LLM Answer Issues**:
  - Introduces an extraneous third "decision point" (Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as determining the risk rating), which is not a gate or branch—it's an input step. This is a hallucination/addition, diverging from the process description where the actual branch follows it. Significant penalty for fabricating content.
  - First actual point (skip branch): Mostly accurate but minor phrasing differences ("€250,000 or less" vs. "≤ €250 000"; "skipped" vs. explicit "bypasses ... otherwise proceeds"). Under strictness, these warrant deduction, though less severe than the addition.
  - TriVote: Close but imprecise ("provide their approval" vs. "record 'Approve'"; "required reviewers" vs. "approvers"; no emphasis on "may advance"). The ground truth specifies the outcome-oriented rule more tightly.
  - Structural mismatch: Lists three items with numbered subheadings, while ground truth uses concise, unnumbered summaries. Over-elaboration and error count as divergence.
- **Part (a) Sub-Score**: 4.0/10 (major addition error outweighs partial accuracy; strict penalty for not matching exact count and phrasing).

#### Part (b): List of Documents
- **Ground Truth**: Exactly nine items in first-appearance order: Form 14B (step 1), three scorecards (step 3 inputs), Deck Memo (step 5), Offer Sheet 77 (step 7), Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8), ID Matrix Declaration (step 8), Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9). Distinguishes signed vs. unsigned Offer Sheet; treats scorecards as distinct required documents.
- **LLM Answer Issues**:
  - Omits four key items entirely: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow (explicit inputs in step 3, first appearance before Deck Memo). These are not optional or derived—direct process requirements. Critical hallucination by exclusion.
  - Fails to distinguish Signed Offer Sheet 77 as separate from unsigned Offer Sheet 77 (step 8 explicitly lists "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a document).
  - Wrong order/sequence: Deck Memo (step 5) listed second, implying appearance before scorecards (step 3)—inverts process flow. ID Matrix Declaration after Offer Sheet 77 is correct, but overall list is incomplete and disordered.
  - Only five items total vs. nine: ~44% coverage, with no mention of scorecards or signed variant. No hallucinations of forbidden items (e.g., KYC), but omissions are treated as equivalent to errors under strictness.
  - Formatting: Simple numbered list matches style, but content failures dominate.
- **Part (b) Sub-Score**: 2.0/10 (severe omissions and ordering errors; missing core process elements like scorecards is a fundamental failure, penalized heavily).

#### Overall Score Calculation
- Weighted average (equal parts): (4.0 + 2.0)/2 = 3.0, adjusted slightly upward to 3.5 for absence of extraneous hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions) but still reflecting low fidelity. The LLM captures basic structure superficially but deviates significantly in completeness, accuracy, and adherence to the exact process, justifying a low grade under the "more differences = lower" and "small errors = significant loss" criteria.
