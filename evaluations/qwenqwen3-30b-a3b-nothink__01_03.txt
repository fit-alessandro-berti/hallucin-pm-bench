4.5

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM answer partially fulfills the prompt. It identifies:  
  1. The Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a “decision point,” which is inaccurate as a decisive gate; the gate is after, based on the risk rating **and** amount.
  2. The conditional branch (skip or perform Manual-Underwriting-Review) is well described.
  3. The description of the “TriVote” approval is essentially correct.

- *Problems:*  
  - The answer incorrectly treats the risk-rating determination itself as a decision point, rather than the skip/bypass gate following it (significant loss: -1 point).
  - The wording for the skip gate is acceptable but less precise than the reference (“If... then step 5 is skipped”) compared to ground truth’s explicit branch logic.
  - For TriVote: correct on the two-out-of-three rule, and all approvers are included by name.
  - Failure to clearly number or explicitly reflect that only these two points are the sole “decision points” (-0.5 point, lack of concise mapping).

**b) Required documents**

- The LLM answer omits scorecard documents (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are required at step 3.
- It omits “Signed Offer Sheet 77” (requested after the offer is prepared, as per step 8).
- Order is close but incomplete versus the ground truth.

*Major omissions:*
  - Missing three core scorecards (high penalty, -2 points).
  - Missing “Signed Offer Sheet 77” (additional -1 point).

*Positives:*
  - No hallucinations (no KYC/AML/credit-report references).
  - All document names otherwise accurate when listed.

Overall, the answer covers most key steps, but omits four required documents and misidentifies the nature of one decision point and omits precise mapping to the supplied process (steps). On a 10-point scale with strict detection of even small errors, this yields a 4.5.
