### Evaluation Rationale (strict grading):
- **Structural differences from ground truth (major deductions)**: 
  - Extra hallucinated task (`wrc_WaitForInfo`) and associated flow (`wrc_SequenceFlow_4`, `wrc_SequenceFlow_6`) for "waits until it is received" – prompt conjoins it with "requests missing information" as descriptive, not separate explicit task. Ground truth correctly loops `request_info` directly to `validate` without inventing. (-1.5)
  - Added `wrc_CheckWarranty` task – semantically reasonable for explicit "checks warranty eligibility", but ground truth omits it (models as direct flow from complete GW to warranty GW). Introduces difference in topology (extra task/flow). (-0.5)
  - 17 sequence flows vs ground's 15; extra due to wait loop. (-0.5)
- **XML validity and technical errors (major deductions)**:
  - Missing `xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"` – renders `<conditionExpression xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression">` invalid; BPMN parser would fail. (-1.0)
- **Extra content (deductions)**:
  - Full `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` section (~200+ lines) with shapes/edges – ground truth is minimal (34 lines, no DI). Prompt requests BPMN XML, not layout diagram. (-0.5)
- **Minor differences (cumulative deductions)**:
  - Task/start names not identical (e.g., start "Customer submits an online warranty claim" vs "Online warranty claim submitted"; casing variations like "validates" vs "Validate"). Matches prompt verbatim better than ground in some cases, but differs from ground. (-0.3)
  - Added unrequired flow names/conditions (e.g., "complete", expressions). Ground has minimal "Yes"/"No". (-0.1)
  - Different IDs/names on gateways/ends/process (ok per rubric, no deduct).
- **Strengths (no full deduct)**: All required gateways (2 exclusive, parallel pair), exactly 2 ends, ID prefix "wrc_", core flow semantically matches process description (validation loop, warranty branch, parallel, success path), task names mostly verbatim to bolded prompt text, no omissions of explicit elements.
- **Overall**: Semantically close (~80% equivalent process model) but structural extras, invalid XML, and bloat prevent higher score. Strict per instructions: significant loss for extras/errors.
