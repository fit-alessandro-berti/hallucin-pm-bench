The LLM answer identifies the correct functional changes and no extraneous information is introduced. However, several formatting deviations from the specified requirements result in substantial point penalties:

- Uses inline notation (no bullet points) instead of the explicit list formatting with hyphens ("-") that is present in the ground truth.
- The required heading order is respected, but the formatting within sections is inconsistent with ground truth (should be hyphen-prefixed lines for each item).
- For gateways, the LLM answer omits the hyphenated list format present in the ground truth, and does not align the column under gateway changes as the ground truth does.
- For gateway changes, the "Gateway_Payment" line in ground truth includes extra spaces for column alignment, but the LLM answer does not (though this is a minor style aspect).
- The gateway changes and the task entries themselves are correct in content and sequence.

While there are no factual errors or omissions in the changes listed, strict adherence to instructions and formatting was explicitly required, so these relatively small but clear formatting issues warrant a significant penalty for strict evaluation.
