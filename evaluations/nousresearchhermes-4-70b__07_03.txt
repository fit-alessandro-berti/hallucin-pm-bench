The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all content (exact tasks added/removed and gateway changes), with no additions, omissions, or commentary. However, it lacks the bullet points (-) used in the ground truth for each list item, which introduces minor formatting differences across all sections (e.g., items are plain lines instead of bulleted). Additionally, the ground truth includes minor alignment spacing in the second gateway entry, which is absent. Under utmost strictness, these small formatting deviations warrant a deduction, but the core functional accuracy remains excellent.
