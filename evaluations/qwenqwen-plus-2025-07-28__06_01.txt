The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order both within pairs and overall, and uses the specified format with one pair per line. Under utmost strictness, it loses a full point for the minor formatting discrepancy in the second pair (lacking the exact multi-space alignment present in the ground truth for column neatness, despite matching the base format `Task_X  —  Task_Y`). No other errors or omissions.
