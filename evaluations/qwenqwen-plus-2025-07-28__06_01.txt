7.5

The LLM answer correctly identified both parallel-executable task pairs in Process B and listed them. However, it lost points for two strict reasons:

- The pair "Procure_Materials  â€”  Schedule_Machines" contains only one space between the task names and the en dash, instead of matching the two spaces before and after the en dash found in the ground truth.
- The answer did not use code block formatting or otherwise match the exact output format as the ground truth.

These are small formatting issues, but per the instruction for "utmost strictness" and "also small errors...reflect in significant loss," they result in a significant reduction from a perfect score. The content is otherwise accurate, so the answer remains high (7.5), but formatting precision was not met.
