10.0

The LLM answer correctly and clearly states that the average cycle time of "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the data provided, as the log lacks any timestamps or duration information. The explanation accurately notes which fields are present and absent, and explicitly states that the calculation cannot be made without temporal data.

The answer does not attempt to fabricate a number, nor does it misuse the provided benchmarks or other data irrelevant to "Review Contract." The reasoning closely matches the ground truth, and all critical aspects (clear answer, justification, specific mention of missing data) are present and stated precisely.

No errors or omissions are present relative to the ground truth, so the strict score is 10.0.
