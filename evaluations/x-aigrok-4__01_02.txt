8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and complete, closely aligning with the ground truth in identifying the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and their branching logic, while using exact activity names from the prompt without introducing unauthorized terminology. The document list is nearly identical, faithfully reproducing all items with wording that matches the prompt's details (e.g., including "single pay-stub or tax slip" and "CIS template," which the ground truth slightly abbreviates). However, under utmost strictness, deduct points for the following small but notable differences:

- **Structure and Conciseness**: The LLM uses a more verbose, explanatory format with headings, bullets, and added implications (e.g., "proceed to Disburse Funds" in Amount Threshold Decision and Underwriter Alignment Gate; specifying "only for amounts ≥ €15 000" in MBA; and an explanatory note on non-decision steps). The ground truth is more concise, using numbered lists without these additions or next-step details, and includes precise flow context (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") that the LLM omits or implies indirectly. This introduces minor expansions not present in the ground truth, violating strict summarization.

- **Wording Precision in Decisions**: Subtle variances include lowercase "approve or reject" vs. ground truth's bolded/capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**"; "proceed to" vs. "send to" for MBA; and "> 2 points" vs. ground truth's exact "differ by ≤ 2" phrasing without the inverse. The added note on other steps being "not explicit decision gates" is accurate but extraneous to the ground truth's direct list.

- **Document List Details**: Minor phrasing differences, such as "≤ 3 months old" (LLM) vs. "≤ 3 months" (ground truth) for Proof of Address, and bullet vs. numbered format. The ground truth includes an extra clarifying note ("No credit bureau report...") that the LLM lacks, though this is not required by the prompt. The LLM's inclusion of "Latest Income Statement" matches the prompt but the ground truth abbreviates the parenthetical slightly differently.

These small deviations (additions, omissions of context, and formatting mismatches) result in a significant but not drastic point loss, as the core content remains faithful and no major inaccuracies or omissions occur. A perfect 10.0 would require an exact replica of the ground truth's structure, wording, and brevity.
