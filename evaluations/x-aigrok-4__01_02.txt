8.0

The LLM answer generally adheres to both the instruction and the ground truth, with fairly strong alignment in terminology, structure, and logic, but there are minor deviations that warrant a significant—but not maximum—penalty.

**Strengths:**
- Uses the correct activity names for all decision points.
- Lists all required documents with proper names and sequence.
- Correctly avoids introducing standard loan terminology.

**Weaknesses:**
- Adds a parenthetical "(only for amounts ≥ €15 000)" at the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA), which is accurate but not in the ground truth structure.
- The phrasing in the Required Documents section slightly deviates ("Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" instead of the original format), which could be considered a small but noticeable inexactness.
- Adds a somewhat unnecessary note: About which steps are or are not decision points; this is not present in the ground truth and, while not misleading, introduces non-essential commentary.
- Adopts a slightly editorial explanatory tone rather than listing the decision points and documents strictly as in the ground truth.

**Total deductions reflect:**
- Non-verbatim listing of document names (e.g., “single pay-stub or tax slip” instead of ground truth “pay-stub/tax slip”).
- Slightly off structure, with embedded explanations that deviate from the ‘list’ style requested.
- Small but repeated deviations in wording and list formatting.

Larger errors or missing items would merit a lower score; here, the answer is very competent but not maximally faithful to the ground truth.
