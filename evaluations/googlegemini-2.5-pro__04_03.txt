The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in content, structure, and reasoning: it correctly identifies "No" compliance, references all rules individually with appropriate satisfaction/violation assessments, and pinpoints the exact violation in Rule 3 based on the trace sequence (NA before RA). Minor deduction for format (bullets vs. table) and slightly less tabular/emoji-based visual clarity, which deviates from the ground truth's presentation despite equivalent information density and no factual errors.
