4.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major failures, ~60% of score weight)**: LLM incorrectly identifies and lists **activities** as "decision points" without any summarization of logic, branches, or outcomes (violates "summarise every **decision point**"). 
  - Includes **Process_Refund_Payment** (step 5), which is an *execution* step per constraints—not a decision (extraneous introduction; -2.0 pts).
  - Misses explicit **amount threshold** as distinct decision post-**Finance_Controller_PreApprove** (-1.0 pt).
  - Misses **final approval/rejection** at approvals (-1.0 pt).
  - No branching logic (e.g., eligible/rejected, >€1000/skip, approved/ends)—just bare names vs. GT's detailed table (-1.5 pts).
  - Result: superficial, inaccurate (2.0/10 subsection).

- **Required Documents (strong match, ~40% of score weight)**: Exact list of 7 documents, no extras introduced (matches GT catalogue). Minor ding for omitting GT's conditional note on **AuditTrail** and closing parenthetical (-0.5 pt). (9.5/10 subsection).

- **Overall Structure/Fidelity**: No table or precise phrasing (e.g., "*Eligibility check* during..."); ignores process nuances/inferences in GT. Strict penalty for incompleteness and errors despite prompt's "Do not introduce...". Total weighted: 4.5/10.
