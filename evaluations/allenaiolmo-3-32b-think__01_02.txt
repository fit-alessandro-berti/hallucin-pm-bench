**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision points (major failures, ~60% weight)**: Correctly identifies the exact 3 decision points using precise names (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)). However, fails entirely to *summarize* them—no conditions (e.g., "≤ 2 points" vs. escalate; "< €15 000" auto-approve vs. ≥ to MBA; "Approve or Reject" vote), no flow context/positions (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split"; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), no descriptive details as in ground truth. Just bare list = incomplete response to "summarise". Deduct 6+ points.
- **Required documents (minor issues, ~40% weight)**: Lists all 6 exactly, matching prompt/content. But phrasing mismatches ground truth: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"; unnumbered bullets vs. numbered list; lacks explanatory note/parenthesis. Small errors → -1.5 points per strictness rule.
- **Structure/Formatting**: Informal bullets vs. ground truth's "#### headers", numbered lists, italics/bold. No adherence to ground truth style. Minor deduct.
- **Overall**: Partial credit for identification/accuracy of items (avoids 1.0), but severe lack of summary depth/details and phrasing slips = low score. Utmost strictness applied.
