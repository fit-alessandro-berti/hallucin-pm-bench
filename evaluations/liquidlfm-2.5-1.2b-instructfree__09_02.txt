The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, correctly identifying the impossibility due to absent timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning (lack of timestamps/durations and reliance on counts only). Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "start or completion times" vs. explicit "start-to-completion intervals" and "duration information"; "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute") and not emphasizing "event counts" explicitly, per strict evaluation criteria.
