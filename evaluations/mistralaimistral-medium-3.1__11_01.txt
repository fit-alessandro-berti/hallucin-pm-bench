8.0

**Justification:**

- **Correctness:** The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by waiting time (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability), using the exact average and 95th-percentile numbers from the table.
- **No Unwarranted Content:** No extraneous activities or metrics (such as service time or throughput) are mentioned. The word count is within 150.
- **Action Relevance:** All three recommendations are data-driven and plausibly aimed at reducing waiting time by ≥ 20%.

**Deductions for Strictness:**
- **Action Specificity:** The LLM answer’s proposed actions are a little less concrete than the ground truth:
    - For Send_Closure_Letter, it suggests hourly batch processing and escalation, rather than the stronger automation (e-signature) in ground truth.
    - For Assess_Liability, the recommendation is to pre-assign based on claim type, which is related but less impactful than bypassing the senior adjuster queue for simple cases via a rules engine.
- **Extra Commentary:** The memo includes sidebar comments like "Prioritize #1—its 95th-percentile wait (5 days!) dwarfs all others." and "Data source: ..." which were not in the template and risk wordiness.
- **Formatting:** The LLM introduces subject lines and sign-off not required in the ground truth, which consumes words and could be considered as slight non-adherence to the "crisp" and ≤150 words brief.
- **Paraphrasing vs. Verbatim:** While the numbers are correct, terms like "Avg wait" and "95th %" are not verbatim, as the ground truth expects.

**Summary:**  
The answer is strong, correctly extracts and ranks activities, and proposes generally plausible waiting-time reductions. Points are lost for not being verbatim or as concrete as the reference and for minor, though not excessive, extra commentary/formatting.
