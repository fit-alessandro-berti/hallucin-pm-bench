### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, rankings, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) are correctly identified and ranked by average waiting time. All quoted averages and 95th-percentile values are verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5h/120h, 12.2h/44h, 7.8h/16.4h). No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities mentioned. (+2.5/2.5)
- **Structure and Constraints**: Crisp memo format with headers, under 150 words (~140). Ranks clearly, focuses solely on waiting times. However, adds minor unwarranted elements like execution counts (275–320, borderline "throughput" discussion per prompt) and interpretive note ("5 days! dwarfs all others"), which ground truth omits entirely. (-0.3)
- **Actions**: Each is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues, and claims ≥20% reduction. Relevant and data-driven in spirit (e.g., proactive nudges for #1). But significant differences from ground truth: #1 adds "self-service portal" (not in ground); #2 suggests batching/escalation vs. ground's e-signature replacement; #3 uses "pre-assign by claim type" vs. ground's "rules-engine for simple cases bypass." Ground specifies "pilot tests/estimated" for data-driven basis; LLM uses "projected" without such support. These variations deviate from the exemplar, warranting strict deduction. (-1.0)
- **Overall Fidelity**: Fulfills prompt requirements effectively but diverges in action specifics and adds fluff, reducing closeness to ground truth's concise, exact style. Strict scoring penalizes these as "small errors" cumulatively.
