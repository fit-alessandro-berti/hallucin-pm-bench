### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, Significant Deduction)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points with precise locations, branching logic, and outcomes (eligibility check with pass/fail, amount threshold with branches, and final approval/rejection leading to payment or termination). The LLM only covers two (eligibility and high-value threshold), omitting the critical final approval decision at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** / **Senior_Auditor_Review**, which is implied by the constraint requiring "success" before **Process_Refund_Payment**. This is a substantial incompleteness, as the prompt demands "every decision point." Additionally, the LLM's summaries lack detail on outcomes (e.g., no mention of rejection paths) and precise sequencing (e.g., high-value decision is "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**" in ground truth, but vaguely placed in LLM). Structure is simplistic (bullets vs. ground truth's detailed table), reducing clarity. This alone warrants a score below 5.0 for this section.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Strengths, but Imperfect)**: The LLM correctly lists all seven documents without introducing extras, aligning closely with the ground truth. It appropriately notes **AuditTrail** as "required for high-value claims," similar to the ground truth's qualification ("only for claims > â‚¬1 000, but still part of the catalogue"). However, it misses the ground truth's explicit parenthetical note reinforcing no other documents or legacy activities, which directly echoes the prompt's warning. This is a small but notable omission under strict evaluation, deducting ~1 point.

- **Overall Adherence to Prompt**: The LLM stays within defined elements (no inventions), but fails on completeness and precision for decision points, violating "summarise every decision point." No extraneous intro or content, but the response is less structured and exhaustive than the ground truth. Strictness applied: ~40% deduction for missing core element, ~20% for detail gaps.
