2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (positive, but minor weight)**: The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization and no mention of forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). This aligns perfectly with the vocabulary policy and ground truth. (+1.0 point)
- **Structure and Completeness (partial credit)**: The table format is appropriate (activities as rows, roles as columns), with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. Activities match the six steps without additions. However, the LLM includes an unnecessary introductory sentence ("Of course. Here is...") and a RACI key, which adds unwarranted content not present in the ground truth. Activity numbering (1.-6.) and selective bolding are deviations from the ground truth's clean, unnumbered presentation. (-1.0 point for extras; +0.5 for basic structure = net -0.5)
- **RACI Allocations (major failures, strict deduction)**: This is the core of the task, and the LLM's assignments deviate substantially from the ground truth, violating the rubric's correctness criteria (e.g., each activity must have exactly one Responsible; Accountable roles, especially for AM, must be reflected appropriately; full allocations including C, I where specified). Key errors:
  - **Receive Application**: LLM only AM=R (blanks elsewhere); ground truth AM=R/A, CO=C, FC=I, IT=I. Missing A, C, I assignments. (-0.8)
  - **KYC Review**: LLM AM=I, CO=R (blanks elsewhere); ground truth AM=A, CO=R, FC=C, IT=I. Missing A, C, I; AM incorrectly I instead of A. (-0.8)
  - **Order Vetting**: LLM AM=R, CO=C (blanks elsewhere); ground truth AM=R/A, CO=C, FC=I, IT=I. Missing A and I assignments. (-0.7)
  - **Payment Clearance**: LLM AM=I, FC=R (blanks elsewhere); ground truth AM=A, CO=C, FC=R, IT=I. AM incorrectly I instead of A; missing C and I. (-0.8)
  - **Record Update**: LLM AM=I, IT=R (blanks elsewhere); ground truth AM=C, CO=I, FC=C, IT=R. AM incorrectly I instead of C; missing CO=I and FC=C. (-0.8)
  - **Notify Customer**: LLM only AM=R (blanks elsewhere); ground truth AM=R/A, CO=I, FC=I, IT=I. Missing A and all I assignments. (-0.7)
  - No use of combined R/A notation; excessive blanks imply incomplete matrix (RACI typically populates most cells based on narrative). Overall, ~70% mismatch in assignments, with no Accountable (A) roles despite rubric emphasis on AM accountability. (-4.5 total for this category)
- **Adherence to Narrative/Rubric (failure)**: The process description implies primary handlers (e.g., AM for 1,3,6; CO for 2; FC for 4; IT for 5), but the ground truth expands logically to full RACI (e.g., consultations, informations). The LLM under-assigns, ignoring implied interactions (e.g., no FC I in several rows). Rubric requires allocations to "reflect the narrative" preciselyâ€”LLM does not. Strictness demands heavy penalty for these core errors.
- **Overall Score Calculation**: Starts at 10.0 max. +1.0 (terms) -0.5 (structure/extras) -4.5 (RACI) = 6.0 base, then -3.5 additional for incomplete/inaccurate reflection of narrative and rubric (e.g., no A roles, pervasive blanks). Final: 2.5. Small errors (e.g., numbering, bolding) contribute to loss, but RACI mismatches dominate.
