6.0

**Justification for Scoring:**

**Vocabulary Validity:**  
- The LLM answer correctly uses all three preferred terms: "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance", and never uses forbidden terms.
- Capitalization and formatting requirements are fully satisfied.

**Major Deviations (Strict Penalties):**
1. **RACI Assignments:**
   - **Responsible vs. Accountable:** The LLM never distinguishes between Responsible (R) and Accountable (A); it uses only "R", and never "A", even where, in the ground truth, "A" or "R/A" is marked. This is a major error. In a strict rubric, failure to distinguish between R and A is a significant deficiency, especially when explicit in the ground truth.
   - **Consulted (C) and Informed (I):** The assignment of "C" and "I" diverges from the ground truth in several cases (see below), which affects correctness.

2. **Incorrect Activity-Roles Assignments:**  
   - *Receive Application*:  
     - LLM gives only "R" to Account Manager; ground truth is "R/A" for AM, but also C for CO, I for FC and IT—all missing from LLM.
   - *KYC Review*:  
     - LLM gives "R" to CO, but only "I" to AM (should be "A"), and ignores FC (should be C) and IT (should be I).
   - *Order Vetting*:  
     - LLM gives only "R" to AM, and "C" to CO; ground truth is "R/A" to AM, C to CO, I to FC and IT.
   - *Payment Clearance*:  
     - LLM gives "R" to FC, "I" to AM (omits "A"); ground truth is A to AM, C to CO, R to FC, I to IT.
   - *Record Update*:  
     - LLM gives "R" to IT, "I" to AM (should be C), omits CO (should be I), and FC (should be C).
   - *Notify Customer*:  
     - LLM gives only "R" to AM; ground truth is "R/A" to AM, I to others.

**Other Noted Issues:**
- **Unwarranted Content**: None. The LLM answer does not add extra steps, roles, or columns—correct in this respect.
- **Self-awareness:** N/A, as per judging rubric.

**Overall:**  
The LLM strictly follows the vocabulary policy—no penalty here. However, it falls substantially short in role assignments and in using both "R" and "A" (it only uses "R"). Given the importance of these elements in a RACI matrix and process-mapping context (where accountability distinction is critical), a loss of 4 points is merited. Minor mapping errors with C/I further justify a strict markdown.

**Final strict score:** 6.0
