3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Strength, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This fully matches the ground truth and policy.
  
- **Structure and Format (Partial, +1.0 point)**: The matrix includes all six activities as rows and the four roles as columns, with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced (meets "unwarranted content" criterion). However, column headers use abbreviations (e.g., "AM (Account Manager)") instead of full names as in the ground truth, and it includes an unnecessary legend (not present in ground truth). Slashes for combined "R/A" are used inconsistently with ground truth's bolding and separation.

- **RACI Allocations (Major Weakness, -5.5 points)**: This is the core failure, with significant deviations from the ground truth, violating the "reflect the narrative" criterion. Strict assessment:
  - **Receive Application**: Correctly assigns AM as R/A, but omits CO (C), FC (I), IT (I) – incomplete.
  - **KYC Review**: Assigns CO as R/A (wrong; ground truth has CO as R only, AM as A); omits AM (A), FC (C), IT (I) – incorrect and incomplete. No single Responsible is properly isolated.
  - **Order Vetting**: Correctly assigns AM as R/A and CO as C, but omits FC (I), IT (I) – incomplete.
  - **Payment Clearance**: Assigns AM as C (wrong; should be A), FC as R/A (wrong; should be R only); omits CO (C), IT (I) – incorrect and incomplete.
  - **Record Update**: Correctly assigns AM as C and IT as R/A (minor issue: ground truth has IT as R only, no explicit A); but omits CO (I), FC (C) – incomplete.
  - **Notify Customer**: Correctly assigns AM as R/A, but assigns IT as C (wrong; should be I) and omits CO (I), FC (I) – incorrect and incomplete.
  - Overall: Fails to ensure exactly one Responsible per activity in alignment with ground truth/narrative (e.g., combined R/A misrepresents separations). Many blanks where ground truth specifies C or I, indicating lack of full RACI coverage. Account Manager accountability is partially correct but not where required (e.g., Payment Clearance).

- **Overall Strictness Penalty (-1.0 point)**: Small errors (e.g., formatting inconsistencies, legend addition) compound the major RACI inaccuracies, leading to significant point loss as per instructions. The answer is ~50% aligned on primary R/A but fails on completeness, accuracy, and narrative reflection, resulting in a low score despite terminology success. No self-awareness issues apply.
