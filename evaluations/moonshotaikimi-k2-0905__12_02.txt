The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid justification citing the key counter-example in case C003 (lines 6 and 7), which alone disproves the "always" claim by showing Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order. However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits the additional counter-example in case C005 (line 11), where Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order at all, which the ground truth explicitly highlights as a second clear violation. The justification is also briefer and less structured, lacking the ground truth's emphasis on multiple "clear counter-examples" and the explicit proof that it "does not always follow," resulting in a partial but not fully comprehensive match.
