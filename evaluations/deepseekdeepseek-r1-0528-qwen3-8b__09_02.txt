The LLM answer clearly and concisely states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to lack of timestamps or duration data. Although the wording is slightly more brief than the ground truth answer, it correctly identifies and explains the key limitation (no timestamp/duration information). There are no factual errors or omissions relevant to the prompt. Given the guidance for strictness, this is a maximally correct, if slightly more concise, response.
