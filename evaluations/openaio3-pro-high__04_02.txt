9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth and mostly accurate. Here’s a breakdown:

- **R1:** Correctly marked as Compliant, good brief justification.
- **R2:** Correctly marked as Violated and gives a correct brief explanation. "Not after last required approval within 2 days" matches the ground truth, but it could be clearer that the last valid approval was 07-Mar.
- **R3:** Correctly marked as Violated, with correct explanation.
- **R4:** Correctly marked as Not Applicable, with appropriate reasoning.
- **R5:** Correctly marked as Violated. The justification identifies Ship_Goods as lacking fresh approval, but doesn't explicitly mention Pay_Invoice (both events occurred prior to the new approval, and ground truth points out both). Still, Ship_Goods is the first step processed and would validate the rule as violated, so this is only a slight omission.
- **R6:** Correctly marked as Compliant, concise and correct reasoning.

**OVERALL RESULT:** Correctly stated as NON-COMPLIANT.

**Point deduction:**  
- R5's justification is a little less complete than the ground truth (mentions only Ship_Goods; a stricter interpretation penalizes for omitting Pay_Invoice).
- R2's justification, although accurate, could explicitly mention which approval is the relevant “last required approval” (03-07).

**Conclusion:** A very strong answer with only minor omissions in justification detail. Thus, 9.0 is appropriate.
