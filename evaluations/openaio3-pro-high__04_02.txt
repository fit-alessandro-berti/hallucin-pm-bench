The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all rule statuses, overall result, and core violation rationales. Justifications are accurate, concise (all â‰¤20 words), and factually correct, with only minor wording variations (e.g., date formats like "03-05" vs. "05-Mar"; R2 phrasing slightly less precise on timing but still captures the essence) and lack of table formatting (not required by prompt). Strict deduction for these small stylistic differences, but no substantive errors.
