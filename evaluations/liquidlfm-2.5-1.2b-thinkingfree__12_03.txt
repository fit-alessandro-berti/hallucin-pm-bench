**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and fails every aspect of the task with utmost strictness applied:

- **Wrong core answer**: Claims "Yes" instead of "No", directly contradicting the ground truth and evidence (ignores C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment; C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment).
- **No case-specific justification**: Task mandates citing "relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences"; LLM provides zero CaseIDs or sequences, offering vague, fabricated generalizations (e.g., "~1.5 minutes" is invented and irrelevant; "strict sequential order" is false).
- **Misrepresents evidence**: Asserts "no intervening activities" universally, but log shows interventions in 2/4 cases, invalidating "always".
- **No alignment to ground truth structure**: Ground truth uses case-by-case table with sequences/notes; LLM's response is generic, non-evidentiary prose.

Total mismatch = minimum score.
