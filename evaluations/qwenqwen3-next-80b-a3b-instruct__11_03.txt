3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct Identification of Activities (Partial Credit, +2.0)**: The LLM correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches (throughput > SLA) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s respectively, the highest in the table). This matches the ground truth.
- **Quantification of SLA Exceeds (Major Deduction, -4.5)**: Critical error in interpreting and calculating SLA breaches. The table's Target_SLA[s] aligns with Avg_Throughput_Time[s] (as confirmed by ground truth, e.g., Legal Approval: 900s throughput vs. 600s SLA = +300s exceedance). The LLM incorrectly sums throughput + waiting to create an "average total time" metric (not provided in data), then compares this invented total to SLA (e.g., Risk Review: 1080s total vs. 300s SLA = +780s, vs. ground truth +300s on throughput). This fabricates metrics, misrepresents breaches by 2-3x the actual values, and violates "ground every sentence in the data" and "no metrics not provided." Small errors in metrics warrant significant loss; this is a foundational miscalculation.
- **Recommendations (Partial Credit, +1.5)**: Uses bullet points only for recommendations, as required. Each is concrete and somewhat tied to activities (e.g., automation for Risk Review). However, they are not strictly data-driven (e.g., "FICO > 700" and "low-to-medium risk cases" invent thresholds absent from data; "pre-populating from Draft Offer" loosely ties to table but extrapolates). Ground truth's actions are similarly inventive but more directly linked to process steps without external metrics like FICO. Lacks the ground truth's projection of impact.
- **Overall Memo Structure and Compliance (Minor Credit, +1.0; Deduction -2.5)**: Outputs only memo text (no extras), ~120 words (close to ≈150). Lacks executive formatting (e.g., To/From/Subject, case summary like "4,805 completed cases"—derivable from table but omitted, missing grounding). Does not mention absent activities/metrics otherwise. No invented activities, but the total time invention counts as a metric violation. Strict evaluation penalizes incomplete professional tone and omissions heavily.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, even small derivation errors (summing unprovided totals) and misalignments with ground truth (e.g., no end-to-end impact statement) result in outsized deductions. The response is functional but undermined by core analytical flaws, yielding a low score.
