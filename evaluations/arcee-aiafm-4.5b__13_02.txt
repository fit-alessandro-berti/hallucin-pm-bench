2.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Completely incorrect. The LLM states 3 occurrences, but the log shows only 1 (in C05). This is a factual error in counting from the provided data, warranting a full deduction for this section.
- **Question 2a**: Incorrect calculation based on the wrong count (3/48 = 6.25% vs. ground truth 1/48 ≈ 2.08%). No points here due to compounding error.
- **Question 2b**: Incorrect (3/12 = 25.00% vs. 1/12 ≈ 8.33%). Again, deterministic math error tied to Q1 miscount.
- **Question 3**: Partially addresses low-support issues (e.g., poor generalization, bias from rare events), meeting (iii) caution against over-generalization and somewhat (ii) instability/uncertainty. However, it fails (i) by not mentioning the single occurrence, instead referencing a "small number" (implying 3), and the explanation is generic rather than tied to specifics like noise, skewing averages, or collapsing estimates. Word count is under 100, but content misalignment reduces value. Minor partial credit.

Overall, the core numeric answers are fundamentally wrong, violating the "only from the data supplied" rule and deterministic nature, leading to a low score despite some explanatory effort. Strict evaluation penalizes these heavily.
