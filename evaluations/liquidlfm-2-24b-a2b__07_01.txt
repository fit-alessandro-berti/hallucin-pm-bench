**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks**: Completely incorrect ("(none)" vs. ground truth lists 2 tasks with exact names and IDs). Major omission = -4.0 points.
- **Removed tasks**: Completely incorrect ("(none)" vs. ground truth lists 1 task with exact name and ID). Major omission = -4.0 points.
- **Gateway type changes**: Partially correct (identifies type shift "exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway"), but misses critical specifics: gateway ID (`gw_valid`), versions (v1/v2), and exact phrasing. Minor accuracy but lacks precision = -2.0 subtotal loss from partial credit (starts at ~4.0 potential, nets 2.0).
- **Formatting/Headings**: Matches prompt exactly (• headings, "(none)" usage), no deduction here.
- **Overall**: Fails core task of factual XML diffing (misses 3/4 key items). Strict policy: significant errors → severe penalty. Total reflects ~50% gateway partial credit, zero elsewhere.
