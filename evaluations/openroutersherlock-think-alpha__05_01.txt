The LLM answer proposes a fundamentally different mechanism (parallel fork with intermediate timer and exclusive OR-join gateway before Task_Triage, modifying f1, f5, f6, and adding multiple flows) compared to the ground truth's simpler interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive with a direct flow to Task_Triage. This introduces extra elements (two gateways) not in the ground truth, alters more flows, and changes the timer's placement/scope (from submission vs. Receive start), violating strict similarity. While both aim to enforce the 48h SLA via timeout to Triage and stay within constraints (no new tasks), the structural and descriptive divergences are substantial, warranting major point loss for lack of alignment.
