**9.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all three questions, with correct identification of 3 cases (listed matching ground truth), "Pack_Items" as the predecessor for C456's Ship_Order, and "Cancel_Order" as the unique activity. Bullet-point format aligns with the prompt's instruction. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., full phrases in Q2/Q3 restating the question vs. ground truth's ultra-concise single terms; extra "distinct" in Q1; quotes and "in the fragment") and lack of exact labeling (**A1** etc.), despite "concise, bullet-point answers only" being followed reasonably. No factual errors, but strict textual/format differences prevent a perfect 10.
