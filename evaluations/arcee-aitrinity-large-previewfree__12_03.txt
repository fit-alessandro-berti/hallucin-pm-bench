9.2

The LLM answer correctly answers **No** and provides accurate counterexamples (C002 and C004) with precise sequences, fully disproving the "always" claim per the task requirements. Justification cites relevant CaseIDs and sequences as instructed, with no factual errors.

**Penalties (-0.8 total, strict evaluation):**
- **-0.4**: Omits exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all 4 cases (C001/C003 comply but are unmentioned, unlike ground truth table).
- **-0.3**: Simpler bullet format vs. ground truth's structured table (less meticulous visualization for process-mining context).
- **-0.1**: Minor phrasing/structure diff (e.g., "**No** **Justification:**" vs. "**Answer:** No. **Justification (case-by-case)**").

Fully sufficient and correct, but differences in completeness/presentation prevent perfect score.
