**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it wrongly concludes "No" for Q1 (ground truth is "Yes"), misinterprets the net structure (claims T4 requires T3, ignoring the T7 path alone suffices for P4→P5 while P2 token persists), provides no valid sequence, and offers flawed reasoning (e.g., T5 consuming P2 prevents prior firing, but sequence shows T5 fires with P2 intact pre-T3). Total inversion of truth; zero alignment on facts, sequence, or explanation.
