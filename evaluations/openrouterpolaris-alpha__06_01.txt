The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from the ground truth (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines) and formats them appropriately, including internal alphabetical ordering within pairs. However, it incorrectly adds two non-parallel pairs (Create_Work_Order — Procure_Materials and Create_Work_Order — Schedule_Machines), as these tasks cannot execute in parallel—Create_Work_Order is a strict predecessor that completes before the others start. This introduces significant factual errors, violating the prompt's requirement to list *only* pairs that "can be executed in parallel." The overall list is also not in alphabetical order due to the erroneous insertions (e.g., Create_Work_Order pairs disrupt the sequence after Create_Documentation but before Procure_Materials). Under strict evaluation, these additions represent major deviations from the ground truth, warranting substantial point deduction despite partial accuracy.
