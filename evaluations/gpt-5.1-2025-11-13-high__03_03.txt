### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is semantically correct and more complete than the ground truth, faithfully modeling all explicitly mentioned flow elements from the prompt (including the required "checks warranty eligibility" task, which the ground truth omits, incorrectly collapsing it into the warranty gateway). It uses the specified gateways (exclusive for completeness and warranty, parallel split/join for step 4), exactly two end events, and prefixes all IDs with "wrc_". The loop for incomplete claims (request info → re-validate) is accurately represented, and no unmentioned elements (e.g., escalations, errors) are invented.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Task name verbatim mismatches (significant deduction, -1.0 total)**: The parallel tasks shorten the prompt's exact phrasing. Prompt specifies "Create shipment order for the replacement unit" and "Schedule courier pickup of the faulty product"; LLM uses "Create shipment order" and "Schedule courier pickup" (matching ground truth's incompleteness but violating the "verbatim" rule). Other task names match prompt text closely (e.g., "validates the claim", "checks warranty eligibility"), with appropriate sentence-case casing.
- **Start event name (-0.5)**: "online warranty claim" is partial/incomplete vs. prompt's "customer submits an online warranty claim"; ground truth's "Online warranty claim submitted" is closer but still interpretive.
- **Minor structural/attribution differences (-0.5 total)**: Extra descriptive names on gateways/ends (e.g., "Product within warranty?", "Claim rejected") and process (name, isExecutable="true"); unnecessary xmlns:xsi; flows defined separately (valid but deviates from ground's inline style). IDs, namespaces, and whitespace differ but are semantically equivalent (no deduction per rubric).
- No omissions or hallucinations; parallel flows and ends are precise. Overall, high fidelity to prompt despite small verbatim and stylistic issues; ground truth's omission of a required task highlights LLM's superiority, but differences in details prevent a perfect score.
