**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Added tasks (major errors, -3.5 points)**: Ground truth lists 3 (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, **Final Reject**). LLM misses **Final Reject** entirely (critical omission; treats as "rename" instead of new task with distinct ID `Task_FinalReject`). Includes unrequested details (e.g., positions like "preceding").
- **Removed tasks (significant error, -1.5 points)**: Ground truth lists 1 (`Reject Loan` / `Task_RejectLoan`). LLM lists it but incorrectly qualifies as "cosmetic rename and ignored" (violates "ignore cosmetic renamings" only for true cosmetics; different ID/name = removal + addition).
- **Gateway-type changes (minor issues, -1.0 point)**: Correctly identifies exclusive → inclusive (XOR/OR). But adds unrequested cosmetic details (names: "Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check").
- **Structure/extras (penalties, -0.5 point)**: Uses correct headings but adds unrequested "Summary of Changes", "Notes", implications, and reordered irrelevancies (violates "strictly under the three headings"; ignores "cosmetic renamings").
- **Overall strictness**: ~70% accurate (2/3 added correct, removal hedged, gateway ok) but misses core change (Final Reject), misapplies rules, adds noise → low score. No leniency for partial credit on errors.
