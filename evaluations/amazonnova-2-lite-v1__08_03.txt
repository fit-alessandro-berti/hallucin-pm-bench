**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" and uses the critical shortcut (T2b) to enable T5 without T3, with accurate step-by-step markings up to T5 matching the ground truth's first four steps. However, under strict evaluation, there are significant differences from the ground truth:

- **Wrong shortest sequence**: Provides `T1 → T2b → T4 → T5` (length 4) as the "shortest firing sequence achieving this order," but ground truth provides `T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3` (length 6) as the shortest sequence *containing both* T5 before T3. The 4-step sequence does not include T3 firing, failing to fully demonstrate "T5 before T3" (interpreted as a trace with both events, T5 preceding T3).
- **Missing key elements**: Omits T6 and T3, and does not explain or show how the feedback loop (T6) enables T3 *after* T5 (essential, as pc requires T6 post-T5). Ground truth explicitly proves this ordering is possible via loop-back and argues minimality (lower bound 4 + 2 extra steps).
- **Incorrect implication**: Claims success "without ever involving ... T3," but ground truth shows T3 *is* involved later, proving the order in a complete trace.
- **No minimality proof**: Lacks ground truth's formal lower bound argument for why 6 is minimal.

These are major content errors (wrong core sequence, incomplete demonstration), warranting major point loss despite good formatting, partial match, and valid prefix. Minor matches (yes, shortcut insight, markings) prevent lower score.
