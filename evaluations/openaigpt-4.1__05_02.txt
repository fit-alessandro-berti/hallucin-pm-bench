9.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, providing the correct unified diff (reducing camunda:dueDate from P5D to P2D for the Collect Equipment task) and a concise rationale that accurately reflects the change. However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM's rationale is slightly less explicitâ€”it does not mention the specific SLA boundary of "3 days" or the contractual aspect found in the reference. This omission, while minor, is a factual incompleteness in the rationale and warrants a deduction. Therefore, the answer earns a 9.0 for accuracy, strictly penalizing the missing, more precise justification.
