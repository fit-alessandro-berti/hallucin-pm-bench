The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in the proposed XML modification (reducing `camunda:dueDate` for "Collect Equipment" from "P5D" to "P2D"), adheres to the output format of a single unified diff hunk followed by a one-sentence rationale, and correctly identifies the improvement's intent to enhance SLA compliance. Minor deductions for slight diff formatting inconsistency (missing closing `@@` line present in ground truth) and rationale differences (e.g., LLM emphasizes "bottleneck" generically without referencing the "3-day SLA" or "no new activities," introducing semantic variance despite overall alignment).
