The LLM answer correctly identifies the factual inaccuracy ("No") and provides a precise, case-by-case justification citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001â€“C004) and sequences, mirroring the ground truth's core analysis of immediate succession. It accurately flags violations in C002 (Pack_Items intervenes) and C004 (Check_Fraud intervenes), supporting the "always" claim's falsehood. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: non-tabular format (bullets vs. ground truth's table), inclusion of extraneous post-Validate_Payment activities (e.g., Ship_Order in C003, Pack_Items in C004), and slight phrasing variances (e.g., "The FACT is incorrect" vs. ground truth's summary). No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes non-identical presentation under "utmost strictness."
