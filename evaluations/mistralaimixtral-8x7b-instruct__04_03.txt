3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct overall verdict ("No")**: Matches ground truth (+2.0 base).
- **Rule 1 & 2**: Accurate assessments (+1.0 each).
- **Rule 3**: Correct violation identified, but garbled/typo-ridden text ("NAsynchronous event_Details...") renders justification partially unreadable (-1.5).
- **Rule 4**: Assessment marked satisfied (correct), but reasoning flawed ("not necessarily after VP"; ignores that rule explicitly requires after VP for High severity, misstates trace implications) (-1.5).
- **Structure/Format**: Informal list vs. clear table; lacks precision/table headers (-0.5).
- **Strictness penalty**: Minor errors (imprecision, garble) compounded into major deviations from gold standard's clarity and exactness (-2.0 total deduction beyond specifics).

Net: Significant differences in justification quality/accuracy justify low-mid score.
