The LLM answer correctly identifies the core factual differences (added tasks by ID, removed task by ID, and the specific gateway type change) and follows the required headings structure without speculation or extraneous details. However, under strict evaluation criteria, it incurs significant point loss for the following differences from the ground truth:

- **Incomplete task descriptions**: Uses only task IDs (e.g., "check_vip") instead of the full element names as they appear in the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). This omits key factual details from the <name> attributes, making it incomplete and not "exact" per the prompt's emphasis on XML content. Similar error for removed task.
- **Gateway phrasing and detail**: Concise but lacks the ground truth's explicit "changed from ... (v1) to ... (v2)" structure, which provides clearer versioning context directly inferable from comparing the snippets. The arrow notation (→) is functional but deviates from the more descriptive format.
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Plain text and • bullets instead of bold headings and * bullets; lacks backticks and emphasis (e.g., **bold** for types), reducing precision and readability relative to the ground truth.
- **Missing closing note**: Omits the ground truth's "(No other differences should be reported.)", though not strictly required by the prompt, it aligns with the instruction to report only what's present and avoid implying more.

These are not minor oversights; they represent incomplete fidelity to the XML's explicit content (names and types) and the ground truth's presentation, warranting a mid-low score despite accurate high-level facts.
