9.5

The LLM answer is nearly identical in content and completeness to the ground truth answer. It correctly states that none of the required metrics can be computed and explains that this is due to the absence of data rows and timestamps in Artefact A. The explanation is precise, accurate, and does not make any unwarranted assumptions or guesses, as required.

The only (very minor) discrepancy is in the degree of detail and phrasing. For example, the LLM answer phrases "because the event log contains no actual rows or timestampsâ€”only column headers are shown" rather than specifying the precise fields ("all event rows and every timestamp"). While this is slightly less specific than the ground truth, it fully satisfies the prompt. The LLM answer is also slightly more concise, which is not penalized in the prompt, but the ground truth gives a tiny bit more explicit detail.

On the basis of "utmost strictness" and penalizing even small errors, I deduct 0.5 points for the answer being less explicit about redacted data than the ground truth, resulting in a score of 9.5.
