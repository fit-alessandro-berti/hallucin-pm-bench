The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false with "No" and provides a one-paragraph justification that accurately cites the key counterexamples from cases C003 and C005, referencing the relevant line numbers (6-7 and 11-12). This closely aligns with the ground truth's structure, reasoning, and evidence, proving the claim does not hold. Minor deductions for small differences, including: inclusion of unnecessary timestamps (not in ground truth), phrasing "without any preceding *Receive_Order* in its trace" versus the ground truth's clearer "but never contains *Receive_Order* at all," and referencing line 12 for C005 (which includes an irrelevant event, Cancel_Order, potentially implying a slight imprecision in scope). Under utmost strictness, these warrant a small but noticeable point loss despite overall high fidelity.
