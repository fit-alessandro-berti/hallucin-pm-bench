The LLM answer correctly identifies the "No" response and provides a valid justification by citing the two relevant counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with accurate sequences and timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns well with the task's requirements for justification via relevant CaseIDs and sequences. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for incompleteness: the ground truth exhaustively analyzes *all* cases (including C001 and C003, where the FACT holds), using a structured table for clarity and to demonstrate the full evidence base from the log. The LLM omits these confirming cases, which, while not erroneous, reduces thoroughness in a process-mining context where comprehensive log review is expected. No factual errors, but the partial coverage reflects a moderate deduction (1.5 points).
