7.0

The LLM answer lists all functional changes correctly and in the right sections, but there are notable errors in formatting that should result in a significant loss of points, given the strictness required:

- The headings are not verbatim as instructed: Dashes ("-") precede each heading, which is not in the ground truth.
- The task entries do not have dashes at the start of each line (the ground truth uses "- ").
- Gateway change entries lack the dash prefix ("-").
- There is a missing space before the parentheses for each task entry.
- In ‘Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel’, the LLM answer omits extra spacing before the new type as shown in the ground truth.
- The order and pairing of fields in the LLM answer is technically correct for content, but the precise formatting (indentation, layout, bullet usage) does not precisely match.

Because the evaluation requires utmost strictness and even small errors are heavily penalized, these formatting deviations—despite correct content—warrant a deduction of three full points.
