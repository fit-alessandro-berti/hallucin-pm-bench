The LLM answer correctly identifies all verifiable functional changes (added tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer; removed: Task_ManualReview; gateway changes: both from exclusive to parallel), with no extras, omissions, or commentary, matching the ground truth content verbatim. However, strict evaluation penalizes formatting discrepancies heavily: leading dashes before headings (absent in ground truth), lack of bullet points ("- ") before all list items (present in ground truth for added, removed, and gateway entries), and absence of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (e.g., no padding after "Gateway_Payment:" to align "exclusive"). These are small but multiple structural differences from the ground truth presentation, warranting a significant deduction from a perfect score.
