The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, directly addressing the impossibility due to absent timestamps while mirroring the ground truth's core reasoning on missing duration data and event counts only; minor wording variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and phrasing of the timestamp absence) prevent a perfect score under strict evaluation.
