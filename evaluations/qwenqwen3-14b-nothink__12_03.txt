The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, structure of justification (case-by-case analysis of all relevant sequences), and conclusion, with no errors or omissions. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., bullet points vs. table format, wording variations like "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate") do not constitute errors under the prompt's requirements, as the core task demands a Yes/No answer and justification via CaseIDs and sequences, both of which are precisely met.
