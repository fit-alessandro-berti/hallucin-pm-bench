6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial match, ~65% alignment)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact changes (added: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). Headings match the prompt's required format exactly (• Added tasks, etc.). No speculation or extra content is added, and no irrelevant differences are reported.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences, strict scoring applied)**: 
  - **Task listings**: Uses only IDs (e.g., "- check_vip") instead of full names with IDs as in ground truth (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). This omits key XML details (the "name" attributes), creating a factual incompleteness—prompt requires "element names exactly as they appear," and names are explicit in XML. Deduct 2.0 points.
  - **Gateway description**: Concise arrow notation ("exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway") vs. ground truth's verbose phrasing with versions ("changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"). Misses explicit versioning and bolding/formatting, reducing precision. Deduct 1.0 point.
  - **Formatting inconsistencies**: Bullet style ("-") vs. ground truth's ("*"), and no backticks or bolding. While headings are correct, list details don't align, treated as small errors warranting deduction. Deduct 0.5 point.
- **Overall**: Core facts are accurate, but deviations in detail, phrasing, and format prevent a higher score. No other categories (e.g., no erroneous "(none)") are mishandled.
