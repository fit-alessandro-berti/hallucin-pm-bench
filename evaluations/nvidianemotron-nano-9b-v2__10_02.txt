1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in nearly every aspect, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key failures include: (1) Incorrect table structure—vertical tasks with horizontal R/A/C/I columns filled with role names, rather than the standard horizontal roles with letters in cells and a legend; (2) Mismatched and incomplete task coverage—extra granular tasks (e.g., separate "Log," "Send SWIFT," "Notify") not in ground truth, omissions of combined elements (e.g., no explicit "Receive"), and rephrasing (e.g., "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"); (3) Omission of the "Operations Manager" role, leading to absent accountability assignments across all tasks; (4) Simplistic and inaccurate RACI assignments—mostly self-assigned R/A with no C/I distribution, ignoring ground truth's nuanced mappings (e.g., for "KYC Review," LLM has solo R/A for Regulatory Liaison, vs. ground truth's C for Analyst, R for Liaison, A for Operations Manager, I for IT Support); (5) Vocabulary violation—uses forbidden "compliance officer" in the "Notify" task; (6) Lack of bolding, mandated wording header, and legend; (7) No post-table notes or exact mappings as in ground truth. These are not minor errors but fundamental mismatches in format, content, roles, assignments, and adherence to the prompt's intent as reflected in the ground truth.
