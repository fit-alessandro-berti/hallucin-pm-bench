**Score: 4.0**

**Evaluation:**

**1. Vocabulary adherence:**  
- The LLM answer correctly uses only the mandated role vocabulary (“Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “KYC Review”), so no points lost here.
- However, for tasks, the LLM sometimes invents unmandated wording like "Log transfer instruction," "Notify compliance officer," or "Send SWIFT message," rather than aligning all activity wording to the stylized, rigorous terminology in the ground truth ("Receive Payment Instruction," "Screen Against Sanctions List," "Archive Record," etc.).

**2. Role coverage:**  
- The LLM answer ignores the “Operations Manager” role, which in the ground truth is consistently used as “Accountable” for every task (except for SWIFT/archiving task, where it’s missing by necessity), so this is a serious deviation.

**3. Mapping accuracy:**  
- The activities are mapped less rigorously. The breakdown of tasks is somewhat reasonable, but the granularity occasionally differs (e.g., “Log transfer instruction” vs. “Receive Payment Instruction”; separately listing “Notify compliance officer,” which is not needed in the ground truth approach).  
- In the ground truth, each task corresponds exactly and explicitly to the steps and uses precisely controlled vocabulary for activities and roles. The LLM is looser in both selecting terminology and decomposing activities.

**4. RACI correctness:**  
- The LLM generally assigns “Responsible” and “Accountable” to the same people for all tasks, which is a marked difference from the ground truth, where “A” is always assigned to the Operations Manager, with “R” and “C” specifically designated for the other roles. That’s a structural, not just a terminology, error.
- Does not assign “Consulted” or “Informed” values adequately according to the more nuanced assignments in the ground truth (e.g., correctly making Transaction Analyst “R” and Regulatory Liaison “A” for sanctions screening).

**5. Table structure & clarity:**  
- The LLM table format is similar but not as rigorous as the prescribed ground truth, and is missing a legend for clarity.

**Conclusion:**  
Because of the above errors — particularly the failure to replicate the critical “Accountable = Operations Manager” mapping across all tasks, the looser activity wording, and different breakdown of tasks — but with some redeeming adherence to enforced vocabulary and table formatting, the score is a **4.0**. The answer demonstrates broad understanding but falls short in the specifics, as required by the prompt and shown in the ground truth.
