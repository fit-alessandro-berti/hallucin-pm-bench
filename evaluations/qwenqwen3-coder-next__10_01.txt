**1.0**

The LLM answer fails on multiple critical criteria with utmost strictness applied:

- **Vocabulary policy violation** (major deduction): Forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") explicitly mentioned in notes, despite strict rule against use "even in brackets or quotes".
- **RACI allocations incorrect** (13/24 cells differ from ground truth; e.g., no **R/A** combos, missing AM Accountable roles, swapped C/I assignments like CO C→I, IT I→C, FC C→I):
  | Activity | Key differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Receive Application | AM: R vs **R/A**; CO: I vs C; IT: C vs I |
  | KYC Review | AM: C vs A; FC: I vs C |
  | Order Vetting | AM: R vs **R/A**; CO: I vs C; IT: C vs I |
  | Payment Clearance | AM: C vs A; CO: I vs C |
  | Record Update | FC: I vs C |
  | Notify Customer | AM: R vs **R/A**; IT: C vs I |
- **Unwarranted content** (extra legend, notes, bolding "**strictly required terminology**", explanatory text on A not used; headers include (AM) etc. vs plain names).
- **Formatting deviations**: Different bolding (e.g., no **KYC Review** bold in LLM row), extra table rows/sections.
- Partial credit only for correct Responsible (R) per row and matrix terms in rows themselves, but overwhelmed by errors. Minimum score warranted.
