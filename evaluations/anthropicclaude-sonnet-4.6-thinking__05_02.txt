8.2

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Core Change (major positive)**: Identical modification (camunda:dueDate="P5D" → "P2D" on Task_CollectEquipment), complying perfectly with rules (one attribute change, no add/delete, single improvement). +9.0 base.
- **Diff Format (significant deductions)**: LLM provides standard unified diff with file headers (---/+++), line numbers (@@ -12,7), and 7-line context hunk—technically correct but deviates from ground truth's ultra-minimal @@-only single-line hunk with no headers/context/line nums. Strict loss: -0.5.
- **Output Structure (minor deduction)**: LLM uses "## 1. Unified Diff" / "## 2. Rationale"; ground truth uses "### Diff (single hunk)" / "### Rationale" under header. Close but not identical. -0.1.
- **Rationale (moderate deductions)**: Both one-sentence, justify same change for SLA. But LLM's is longer/more detailed (accurate 12→9 day calc, % breakdown, escalation reference); ground truth shorter, introduces unprompted "3-day SLA" (inaccurate vs cumulative ~9 days post-change) and rule reminder. Semantic overlap but wording/content mismatch. Strict loss: -0.2.

Total reflects utmost strictness: high for substance, penalized for non-identical format/content.
