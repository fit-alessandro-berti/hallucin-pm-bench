The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation & Quality_Check; Procure_Materials & Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and outputs one per line in a format closely resembling the specified `Task_X  â€”  Task_Y`. However, it deviates slightly from the exact spacing in the format example (e.g., uses single spaces around the em dash instead of the apparent double spaces before/after as shown, and lacks alignment padding in the second line to match the ground truth's table-like formatting). Under utmost strictness, these minor formatting inconsistencies warrant a deduction, but the core content and structure are precise, preventing a larger loss.
