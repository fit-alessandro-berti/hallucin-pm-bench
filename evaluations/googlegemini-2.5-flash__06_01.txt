6.5

The LLM answer identifies the correct two pairs of tasks that may be executed in parallel in Process B, but it loses points for the following issues:

- The required output format is not followed:
  - The answer omits *double spaces* on both sides of the em dash (—) as specified in the ground truth (`  —  ` vs the submitted single space or no space).
  - The output is not in a code block as in the ground truth. (This was not required, but affects closeness.)
- The order of the pairs is correct (alphabetical), and the pair members are listed alphabetically within each pair.
- The line for “Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines” is missing the spaces aligning the two pairs, which the ground truth provides for visual alignment.

Given the instruction to grade with the utmost strictness, these formatting errors (especially the spacing around the em dash, which was explicitly required in the format) are significant and reduce the grade substantially, despite the substantive correctness.
