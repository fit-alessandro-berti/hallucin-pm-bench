7.5

The LLM's answer closely identifies the correct three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment) based on SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth.

Strengths:
- Activities selected are correct.
- Over-SLA amounts and waiting times are quantitatively correct.
- Only table activities and metrics are mentioned, adhering to instruction #2.
- Recommendations are concrete, data-related, and in bullet points.

Weaknesses and point deductions:
- The LLM omits explicit numerical activity headers (i.e., doesn't clearly format with bold activity names and numbers as in the ground truth).
- Recommendations for improvement, while reasonable and plausible, lack the specificity and grounding in operational detail found in the ground-truth answer (e.g., "introduce rule-based pre-checks" vs. "optimize Risk Review by improving the initial information provided"—the LLM’s proposals are more generic and less data-driven/specific).
- Minor formatting differences: The LLM's format is less clear/concise compared to the structured ground truth.
- No mention of sample size or cycle time improvement as in the ground truth, though this is a less significant issue.
- The LLM memo repeats "concrete action is..." for each bullet, which could be more tightly worded.

In summary, the main metrics, findings, and structure are present, but the lack of implementation detail, operational specificity, and precise phrasing/summarizing leads to a stricter deduction under the given grading policy.
