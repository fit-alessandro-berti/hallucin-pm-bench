The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a concise justification citing the key counter-example in case C003 (lines 6-7), where Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order, directly contradicting the "always follows" claim. However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for omitting the second counter-example in case C005 (line 11), where Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order in that case, which the ground truth explicitly highlights as additional proof. This incompleteness in the justification, despite the overall correctness, represents a notable gap relative to the gold-standard response's comprehensive coverage of all relevant instances.
