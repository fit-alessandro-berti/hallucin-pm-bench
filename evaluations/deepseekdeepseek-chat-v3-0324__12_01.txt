The LLM answer is accurate, clearly structured, and correctly cites relevant case IDs and activity sequences as justification. The answer correctly identifies that in all cases where both activities occur, "Update_Inventory" comes before "Authorize_Refund" (not after), and points out that in one case "Update_Inventory" never occurs. It also explicitly states that there is no instance where "Authorize_Refund" immediately precedes "Update_Inventory", matching the key verdict.

Small points deduction:

- The LLM answer says: "In Case 1003, 'Update_Inventory' ... occurs *before* 'Authorize_Refund'", which is correct, but does not mention the intervening activity ("Quality_Check") that shows the activities are not even adjacent. The ground truth more precisely references line numbers, making the evidence slightly stronger.
- The LLM answer says "after" for Case 1001 but does not as explicitly state that the claimed order is "reversed" (though by context this is clear).
- The phrase "the claimed sequence cannot apply" could be slightly tighter if it said "'always' is disproved" as the ground truth notes, but the meaning is effectively similar.

These are minor stylistic differences, not major factual errors, but strictness requires minor penalties for these subtle differences.

Overall, the substance and logic are correct, precise, and well-justified, earning a high but not perfect score.
