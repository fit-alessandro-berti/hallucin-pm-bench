The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt and ground truth. It adheres strictly to the user instructions by focusing solely on Process B, numbering the sets sequentially, and providing no extraneous information about Processes A or C.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total):
- Formatting of parallel sets: Uses commas instead of the explicit ‖ symbol (-0.3), lacks backticks around task names (-0.2).
- Missing descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**") (-0.2).
- Omits confirmatory sentence "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel" (-0.1), though not explicitly required by the prompt.

Semantically and functionally identical to ground truth; differences are purely stylistic and do not impact accuracy or completeness.
