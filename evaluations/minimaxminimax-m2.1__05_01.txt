The LLM answer captures the core idea (interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive routing to Task_Triage for 48h SLA enforcement) and stays within constraints (plain English, ≤120 words, no new tasks, references IDs). However, strict deductions for: (1) missing ID for new timer event ("Timer_48h"); (2) imprecise connection ("route directly" vs. explicit "add new sequenceFlow from Timer_48h to Task_Triage"); (3) vague duration ("48-hour" vs. BPMN-standard "PT48H" in XML tag); (4) minor phrasing ("reconnected flow" implies reuse vs. new flow; no "bypassing document requests"). Functionally equivalent to ground truth but lacks precision/details, costing 1.5 points.
