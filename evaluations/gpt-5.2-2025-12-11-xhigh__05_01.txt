**3.0**

The LLM answer incorrectly attaches the interrupting boundary timer to **Task_RequestDocs** (only covers missing-docs branch after GW_Docs), failing to handle delays in **Task_Receive** or **Task_Check**—critical paths to **Task_Triage**. This violates SLA for those cases, as the timer never activates. Ground truth correctly uses **Task_Receive** for full coverage from near-submission. LLM complicates with unspecified *timeDate* (requires unmentioned variable setup from **Start_Claim**) vs. ground truth's simple **PT48H**. Adds extraneous "escalated flag" and lacks XML details/IDs (e.g., no "Timer_48h"). Partial concept match, but major functional flaws and mismatches deduct heavily.
