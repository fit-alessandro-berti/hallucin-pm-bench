The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth in content, pairs identified (only the two correct parallel pairs from Process B), alphabetical ordering within pairs and overall list, and format (one pair per line with the specified structure). Minor whitespace variations (e.g., exact spacing around the em dash) are negligible and do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they do not alter meaning, readability, or compliance with the prompt.
