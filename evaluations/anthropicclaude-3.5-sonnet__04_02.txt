4.0

### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification similar and concise (under 20 words). Full points here.
- **R2**: Status correct (Violated), but justification factually incorrect—Ship_Goods (05-Mar) is actually *within* 2 days of initial Finance_Approval (04-Mar), not ">2 days." Fails to account for post-change final approval (07-Mar) as the "last required approval," linking to R5 dynamics. Significant error; major point loss.
- **R3**: Status correct (Violated). Justification accurate and concise. Full points.
- **R4**: Status correct (Not Applicable). Justification equivalent. Full points.
- **R5**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated). Justification wrong—ignores that Ship_Goods (05-Mar) and Pay_Invoice (06-Mar) are "further processing" steps after Change_Request (04-Mar) but *before* new Manager_Approval (07-Mar). Critical misinterpretation of rule and trace; severe point loss.
- **R6**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification accurate. Full points.
- **Overall**: Result correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but explanation incomplete/misleading (omits R5 violation, incorrectly attributes only R2/R3). Partial credit.
- **Format/Strictness**: Follows required structure (status + ≤20-word justification per rule, all-caps conclusion). No intro/table issues, but content errors dominate. With utmost strictness, the wrong R5 status and R2 justification flaws represent substantial deviations from ground truth, warranting a low score despite partial accuracy (e.g., 5/6 statuses correct).
