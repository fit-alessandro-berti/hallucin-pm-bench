5.5

Rationale:

Strengths:
- The LLM gives concise, clear rule-by-rule answers and justifies each in <20 words.
- Correctly flags R2 and R3 as violated, R1, R4, R6 as compliant/not applicable.
- Correct overall non-compliant assessment.

Major Issues:
- **R5 is inaccurately marked “Compliant”**: The LLM fails to notice both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before the second Manager_Approval. This is a critical error, as R5 is violated per the trace and ground truth.
- LLM’s justification for R2 is ambiguous (“after last approval”), not specifying which approval is relevant post-change.
- Justification for R5 is incomplete and inaccurate.

Grading:
- One major rule misapplied (R5) = severe deduction.
- Justifications for R2 and R5 are less precise.
- Otherwise, structure and most judgments match ground truth.

Deduction for critical error and minor justification imprecision leads to 5.5.
