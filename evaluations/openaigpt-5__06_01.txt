The LLM answer lists both correct pairs of parallel tasks as per the ground truth. However, it loses points for a small, but significant formatting error: the answer omits the extra spaces in the second pair ("Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" instead of "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"), which the instructions imply should be strictly followed in line with the ground truth output shown. According to the guidelines to be "utmost strict" and penalize even small errors, this deviation justifies a deduction from a perfect score. The content and order are otherwise correct.
