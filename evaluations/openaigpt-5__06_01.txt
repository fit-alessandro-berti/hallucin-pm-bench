The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B, lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified one-pair-per-line format with the em dash. However, it fails to match the exact spacing/alignment in the ground truth for the second pair (lacking the additional padding spaces after "Procure_Materials" to align the em dash column), which constitutes a minor but detectable formatting discrepancy under strict evaluation criteria. This results in a deduction from a perfect score.
