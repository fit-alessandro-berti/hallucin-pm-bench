The LLM answer identifies only the first parallel set correctly but omits the second set entirely, which is a critical incompleteness representing half the required content. It also fails to structure the response as numbered *sets* (instead numbering individual tasks within a single implied set) and lacks clear indication of concurrency (e.g., no parallelism notation like "‖"). The ground truth requires explicit numbering of sets in process order, full coverage of both parallel constructs, and a note on no others—none of which are met. This results in major deviations, warranting substantial point deduction under strict criteria.
