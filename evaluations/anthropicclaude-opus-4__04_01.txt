6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Compliance Verdict**: Both correctly identify "Non-compliant," earning partial credit for the high-level match (2/10 weight).
- **Rule 1**: LLM's justification is confused and self-contradictory (initially claims "Violated" but then describes it as correct), differing from ground truth's clear "Satisfied." This is a significant error in clarity and accuracy (-1.5 points).
- **Rule 2**: Exact match in identifying violation (Ship_Goods before Risk_Assessment), including event citations. Strong alignment (+2.0 points).
- **Rule 3**: Major discrepancy—LLM incorrectly deems "Compliant" with a flawed distance count (ignores event 9, claims "exactly 2" instead of exceeding limit), while ground truth marks "Violated" (distance=3). This misses a key violation, warranting strict deduction (-2.0 points).
- **Rule 4**: Matches ground truth's "Satisfied/Compliant," with accurate reasoning (no direct Intern after CFO) (+1.0 point).
- **Rule 5**: Exact match in "Satisfied/Compliant," including event reference (+1.0 point).
- **Structure and Completeness**: LLM uses a similar numbered format with rule citations and concludes with the violation summary, but fails to note multiple violations (only cites Rule 2) and has formatting inconsistencies (e.g., inconsistent bolding/emphasis). Ground truth is more precise and comprehensive (-1.0 point total).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, the Rule 3 error and Rule 1 confusion are not minor—they alter the justification's validity and completeness, leading to a mid-range score despite the correct verdict. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply.
