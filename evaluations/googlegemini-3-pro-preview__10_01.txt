4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Compliance (Strong Match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all three mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This fully aligns with the vocabulary policy and rubric's correctness criterion.
  
- **Matrix Structure and Format (Partial Match, +1.5 points)**: Activities are listed as rows and roles as columns, matching the prompt. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced (rubric compliance). However, the table is Markdown-formatted but lacks full role names in headers (uses abbreviations only, unlike ground truth's full names). The added "RACI Definition" is unwarranted explanatory content, though minor and not violating the "no extra tasks/roles/columns" rule directly. Bolding of **R** is present but inconsistent with ground truth's selective bolding of R cells only.

- **RACI Allocations (Major Mismatch, -4.0 points, strict penalty applied)**: This is the core failure. The LLM provides only the Responsible (R) role per activity, leaving all other cells blank, resulting in an incomplete RACI matrix. A full RACI requires specifying R, A, C, I (or blanks) across roles for each activity to show accountability, consultation, and information flow. The ground truth infers these from the narrative (e.g., Account Manager as A/R in multiple steps, CO as C in several). Specific errors include:
  - No Accountable (A) designations, especially for Account Manager where "appropriate" per rubric (e.g., Receive Application should be R/A for AM, not just R).
  - No Consulted (C) or Informed (I) roles (e.g., KYC Review misses A for AM, C for FC, I for IT; Record Update misses C for AM/FC, I for CO).
  - While each activity has exactly one R (matching rubric partially), this ignores the narrative's implied interactions (e.g., Compliance Officer involved post-documents in step 2, suggesting consultation elsewhere).
  - Strictness penalty: Even if inferring full RACI from the sparse narrative is interpretive, the LLM's output deviates substantially from ground truth, treating RACI as a simple "who does it" list rather than a comprehensive matrix. Small omissions (e.g., missing I for IT in most rows) compound to major incompleteness.

- **Overall Correctness and Fidelity to Narrative (Low, +1.0 point)**: Allocations partially reflect the process description's "handled by/performed by" assignments for R (e.g., AM for Receive Application, CO for KYC Review). However, it fails to expand into a true RACI as shown in ground truth, which better captures workflow interdependencies. No self-awareness issues (N/A per rubric).

- **Total Score Calculation**: Starting from a baseline of 0, +4.5 for partial matches, heavily deducted for incomplete core content. This is not a minor error but a fundamental misrepresentation of RACI, warranting significant loss under strict evaluation. A perfect score would require near-identical full matrix to ground truth.
