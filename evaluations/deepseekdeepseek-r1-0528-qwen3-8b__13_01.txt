The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt's constraints (no inferences beyond the log lines). For Q1-Q3, responses match exactly on key facts, calculations, and listings. For Q4, the two reasons provided (temporal bias and small sample size) directly align with two of the specified ground-truth options, clearly stated without hallucination or deviation. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., phrasing in Q3 lacks explicit "only," but correctly lists the sole case as requested) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they preserve factual integrity and completeness.
