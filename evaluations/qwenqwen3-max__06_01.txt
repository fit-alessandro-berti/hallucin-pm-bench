The LLM answer perfectly identifies the two required parallel pairs from Process B, lists them in the correct alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and adheres to the specified output format with one pair per line and the exact "Task_X  —  Task_Y" structure (including two spaces before and after the em dash). The minor spacing variation in the ground truth's second line appears to be an alignment artifact for presentation in a code block, not a required element of the format—thus, no errors or differences impacting accuracy.
