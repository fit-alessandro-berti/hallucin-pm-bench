The LLM answer contains both correct pairs, with correct task names, and omits any incorrect or extraneous pairs. However, it does not strictly follow the format specified in the ground truth answer: the pairs are not aligned (the second pair is not padded with spaces for alignment). The ground truth aligns the pairs for neatness, so this minor format inaccuracy should result in a small but significant penalty.

Content-wise, the answer is accurate and complete. Format-wise, it is almost perfect but loses 1 point for lack of alignment that was present in the ground truth.
