The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth in content, pairs identified (only the two correct parallel pairs from Process B), alphabetical ordering within pairs and overall list, and the specified output format (one pair per line with the em dash). The minor difference in spacing/alignment on the second line of the ground truth (likely for visual monospaced formatting) does not constitute an error, as the prompt does not require alignment—only the general format `Task_X  —  Task_Y`. No deviations in task references, no inclusion of Process A, and adherence to ignoring non-parallel tasks.
