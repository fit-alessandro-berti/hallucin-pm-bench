The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content and intent across all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 cases; Q2 provides the exact sequence; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities alphabetically, one per line, with no additions, omissions, or factual errors. Minor formatting differences (e.g., lack of dashes in Q3) do not constitute errors given the prompt's instructions.
