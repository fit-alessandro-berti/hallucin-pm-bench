9.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, with all substantive changes correctly identified and attributed under the correct headings:

- **Added tasks**: All three expected new tasks are listed, with both IDs and labels.
- **Removed tasks**: The only removed task is listed, with both ID and label.
- **Gateway-type changes**: The exclusiveâ†’inclusive conversion for the correct gateway is captured.

Minor issues that penalize the score slightly:
- The LLM mentions a name update ("Eligibility Check") in the gateway change, which the prompt said to ignore as "cosmetic renamings". The ground truth does not mention this at all.
- LLM formats the changes similarly but doesn't quite strictly use the boldface and bullet/numbering style from the ground truth (minor stylistic issue).

These are subtle, but as per the request for "utmost strictness," such a deviation costs a notable fraction. The essence and completeness are strong, but there is a very slight over-description regarding the gateway name change.

**Overall: 9.5**
