7.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), the single removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the core gateway-type change (exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision). It uses the exact required headings and groups changes appropriately without fabricating details.
- **Errors/Differences (strict deductions)**:
  - Includes irrelevant detail in "Gateway-type changes" by mentioning the gateway name update ("Eligibility Check"), which violates the instruction to "Ignore cosmetic renamings" (significant deduction for non-compliance; ground truth omits this entirely).
  - Minor formatting/ordering inconsistencies: Lists IDs before names in "Added tasks" (ground truth reverses this); uses numbered bullets under headings (ground truth uses simpler numbered lists with bold names); bolding and terminology differ slightly (e.g., LLM uses full "Exclusive Gateway" vs. ground truth's "exclusive (XOR)"; no italics for version references).
  - Lacks ground truth's precise BPMN shorthand (XOR/OR) and closing note, making it slightly less meticulous.
- **Overall**: 90% content match, but strict policy on errors (even small ones like ignoring instructions) warrants deduction from a potential 10.0 to 7.0â€”no major omissions, but precision and adherence issues prevent higher.
