**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and invalid BPMN:
- Proposes invalid "timer start event on Task_Triage" (start events initiate processes, not attach to tasks; cannot measure time *to* reach Triage).
- Fails SLA: Does not ensure reaching **Task_Triage** within 48h from submission (**Start_Claim**); escalation *after* Triage via **f7** is irrelevant/opposite.
- Introduces multiple invalid/undefined events ("escalation event", "intermediate escalation event") vs. ground truth's single boundary timer.
- No interrupting mechanism or bypass to **Task_Triage**.
- Wrong timing origin (not from submission).
- No XML details like `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`.
Massive deviations; zero functional equivalence.
