9.0

**Evaluation Rationale (strict line-by-line assessment):**

- **Q1/A1**: Core answer "**3**" matches exactly (+3.33/3.33 points). Extra phrase "There are **3** distinct cases: C001, C002, and C003." is unrequested detail (treated as extra element per instructions; -0.33 for verbosity beyond ground truth "**3**").
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match, including "→" separators and activity names (+3.33/3.33 points). Minor intro text "The sequence... is:" ignored as non-factual wrapper.
- **Q3/A3**: Core list content exactly matches distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered (+2.34/3.33). Deductions for: format differences (bold ** instead of "-", no "<br>" explicit, intro phrase; -0.33); full "### Explanation" section with redundant (though factually correct) details (-0.66, significant extra elements treated as hallucinations per instructions).

**Total: 9.0/10.0**. Perfect factual accuracy and core compliance, but strict penalties applied for all extras/formatting diffs vs. concise ground truth (no fabrications/missing elements).
