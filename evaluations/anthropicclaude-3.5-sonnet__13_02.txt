10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match precisely (2.08% and 8.33%, with correct calculations). For question 3, the response is under 100 words (~85), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue (low support, only one instance/case), notes variance/instability (unreliable metrics, outlier risk, insufficient evidence for patterns), and cautions against over-generalization (unreliable predictions, incorrect insights from limited data). All ground truth criteria are met without deviation or invention.
