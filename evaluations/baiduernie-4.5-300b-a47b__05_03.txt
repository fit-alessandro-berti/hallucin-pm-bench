2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria: (1) Incorrect attachment of the boundary timer to "Activity_VerifyID" instead of "Activity_CreateAccount," fundamentally misaligning with the SLA's timing (from end of Verify Identity to completion of Create Account, not duration of Verify itself)—a critical conceptual error deducting ~4 points; (2) Malformed XML with invalid dual event definitions (timer and escalation in one boundaryEvent, non-standard in BPMN 2.0) and no cancelActivity="true" for interruption, plus an external escalation definition without a proper catching mechanism—technical inaccuracies deducting ~2 points; (3) Incomplete implementation, as no sequence flow connects to the existing "Activity_AMReview" (merely referenced in justification with an admission of needing "implementation"), failing to reuse the unused task effectively without new activities—structural omission deducting ~1 point; small justification phrasing issues (e.g., vague "automatically triggers an escalation" without specifying path) deduct ~0.5 points. Partial credit for identifying the unused "Activity_AMReview" and attempting a timer-based enforcement (+1 point total), but overall mismatches in XML elements, correctness, and completeness dominate.
