8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in core requirements: correctly identifies the **same three activities** (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst-performing based jointly on SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s), quantifies exceedances precisely, uses bullets exclusively for recommendations (one concrete action per activity), and structures as an executive memo (~220 words vs. ground truth ~140, minor deviation from ≈150). Data-grounding is strong—no absent activities/metrics invented; derived work times (e.g., 120s = 600s-480s) are legitimate inferences from provided throughput/waiting.

**Point deductions (strict assessment, -0.5 to -1.0 per category for differences):**
- **Structure/Phrasing (-0.5):** Headers/subjects/from differ (e.g., "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" matches system role vs. ground's "Process Performance Office"); order of activities reversed; intro basis "total excess time across cases" vs. "largest queues" (both valid but divergent); extra derived % (e.g., 100% exceedance, 80% waiting share) not in ground truth or table.
- **Recommendations (-1.0):** Completely different content (e.g., LLM: FTE capacity, triage juniors, automate checks vs. ground: pre-checks bypass, add analyst+automate, straight-through heuristic); both data-driven via derived work times/waiting but no overlap; LLM bullets use "-" + bold activity vs. ground's "•" post "**Recommended actions**".
- **Minor inventions/extras (-0.5):** Placeholder "[Current Date]" vs. ground's invented "April 2025"; post-recs closing paragraphs diverge; slightly over word limit.

High fidelity on prompt essentials (90% alignment) yields 8.0; rec/content variances prevent 9+ under strictness.
