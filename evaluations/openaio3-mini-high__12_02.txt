The LLM answer gives the correct "No" and correctly identifies both counterexamples (C003 and C005), referencing the correct lines and activity order. However, the justification omits explicitly stating that C005 never contains a "Receive_Order" event at all (it implies this by saying "without a preceding Receive_Order," but does not clearly state there is no such event in C005). Also, it does not clearly articulate that the fact is about "always" and that any one counterexample is sufficient. The gold-standard answer is much clearer and more explicit in both its explanation and logical structure. These small lapses merit a significant points loss for strict grading.
