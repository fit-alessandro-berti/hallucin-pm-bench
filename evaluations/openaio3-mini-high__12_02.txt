The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a concise, accurate justification in one paragraph, citing the key counterexamples (C003 with lines 6â€“7 showing reversed order, and C005 with line 11 lacking any prior Receive_Order). This aligns closely with the ground truth's substance and emphasis on these instances disproving the "always" claim. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., not explicitly stating C005 "never contains Receive_Order at all" and adding unnecessary timestamps, which are correct but extraneous) and less structured formatting compared to the ground truth's bullets, per the strict evaluation criteria.
