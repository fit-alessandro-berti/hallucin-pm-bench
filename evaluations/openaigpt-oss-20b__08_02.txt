The LLM answer correctly identifies the possibility (Q1) and provides an accurate minimal sequence matching the ground truth (Q2). The explanation is concise, factual, and under the 120-word limit (actual ~85 words, despite the erroneous "(120 words)" claimâ€”a minor inaccuracy deducting 1 point). However, it omits explicit marking states (e.g., M1={P1,P2}), which are essential for precise verification in Petri net analysis, and the confirmation of T3's subsequent disablement. These small omissions reduce completeness without affecting core correctness.
