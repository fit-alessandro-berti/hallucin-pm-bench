### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiency, ~60% penalty)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points: (1) eligibility validation (implied rejection/continuation in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility), (2) amount threshold branching (post-Finance_Controller_PreApprove), and (3) final approval/rejection (at Finance_Controller_PreApprove/Senior_Auditor_Review). The LLM answer only covers the amount threshold (decision #2) and misplaces it "at" Finance_Controller_PreApprove instead of after. It entirely omits the eligibility and final approval decisions, which are core to summarizing "every decision point" per the prompt. This incompleteness is a critical error under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Strengths with Issues, ~20% penalty)**: The LLM correctly lists all seven documents from the process description without introducing extras (e.g., no legacy artefacts). However, it structures them per step with added interpretive descriptions (e.g., "to verify passenger/booking details" for FlightManifest), which are logical inferences but not explicitly defined in the promptâ€”potentially bordering on "introducing" unstated details. The ground truth provides a flat, exhaustive list with a conditional note on AuditTrail, which the LLM handles adequately but less concisely. The added "Key Constraints" section is redundant and not requested.

- **Overall Fidelity and Adherence (Additional ~20% penalty)**: The response is well-organized and avoids prohibited elements (e.g., no legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide"), but it deviates structurally from the ground truth's tabular/numbered format and injects unprompted summaries/explanations. Strictness demands near-exact alignment; these differences, combined with incompleteness, prevent a higher score.
