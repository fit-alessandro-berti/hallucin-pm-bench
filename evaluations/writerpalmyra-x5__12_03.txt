The LLM answer is factually correct, correctly identifies "No" with precise counterexamples (C002 and C004) matching the log sequences, and justifies via relevant CaseIDs and activities, directly addressing the "always" claim. However, under utmost strictness:
- Lacks exhaustive case-by-case analysis of **all** 4 cases (omits confirming C001 and C003 as compliant, unlike ground truth's comprehensive table).
- Does not quantify violations (e.g., "two out of four") or use structured table for sequences/notes.
- Minor phrasing differences (e.g., no bolding/emphasis on sequences, less explicit "immediate successor" checks).
These omissions reduce completeness despite logical sufficiency for disproof, warranting a small but significant deduction from perfection.
