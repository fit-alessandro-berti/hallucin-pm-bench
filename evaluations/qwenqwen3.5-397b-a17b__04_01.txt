7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correct overall verdict**: Both correctly identify "Non-compliant" (full match, no deduction).
- **Identifies exact same violations (Rules 2 & 3)**: Perfect match on reasoning for Rule 2 (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods, citing events 4,8,9). No deduction.
- **Rule 3 details**: Correctly lists the three intervening activities (7-9). However, states "distance of 4" vs. ground truth "distance = 3" — small but precise numerical error in distance calculation (strict deduction of 1.0).
- **Missing comprehensive rule checks**: Ground truth exhaustively verifies **all 5 rules** (noting Rules 1,4,5 satisfied with specifics like events, roles, PO amount). LLM only covers violated rules, omitting confirmation of satisfied ones (e.g., no mention of Rule 1 approvals before Issue_PO, Rule 4 Intern not following CFO, Rule 5 ending). This lacks thoroughness expected for a "senior process-audit bot" and creates structural/content differences (strict deduction of 1.5).
- **Format/minor diffs**: Numbered justification cites relevant rules (good), but lacks ground truth's full structure (header "Justification", per-rule numbering 1-5, explicit summary conclusion tying to non-compliance). Bolding/style minor variance (no further deduction).
- **Strictness applied**: Perfect match = 10.0. Deductions for incompleteness (1.5) + numerical error (1.0) = 7.5. No other errors (e.g., Rule 1/4/5 not misstated, just unaddressed).
