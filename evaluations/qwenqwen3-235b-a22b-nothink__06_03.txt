**Score: 9.5**

**Justification:**
- The LLM answer correctly identified both sets of concurrent tasks, matching the ground truth in content and order.
- The answer presents the concurrent tasks in clear sets, accurately reflecting process structure; the tasks listed for each set are identical and nothing extraneous is present.
- There is a slight deviation in formatting style (e.g., calling them "Parallel Split #1" instead of "first parallel block," and slight elaboration in wording), but the user requested strictness regarding differences from the ground truth answer.
- Although the answer is slightly more verbose ("These are the two sets ... appearance in the process"), it does not add information about other processes.
- However, since the instruction is to grade with *utmost strictness*, even these minimal differences in phrasing and extra sentence for clarification justify a 0.5 point penalty.

**Hence, the answer earns a 9.5.**
