8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Accuracy (High Marks)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two parallel sets in Process B, listing the exact tasks (`Quality_Check` and `Update_Inventory` for the first; `Generate_Replenishment_Report` and `Notify_Procurement` for the second) in the correct order of appearance. No incorrect tasks, extraneous processes (A or C), or missed parallels are included, aligning perfectly with the ground truth content.
- **Deductions for Differences (Strict Application)**:
  - **Formatting and Presentation (-0.5)**: Uses bullet points and backticks for tasks instead of the ground truth's inline format with `‖` symbol (e.g., "`Quality_Check` ‖ `Update_Inventory`"), which subtly alters the visual representation of concurrency. Ground truth employs a more compact, BPMN-like notation.
  - **Wording Variations (-0.5)**: Titles the response with an unnecessary header ("**Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment: Concurrent Task Sets**") and labels sets as "(Parallel Split #1)" vs. ground truth's "first parallel block." Adds an explanatory sentence ("These are the two sets...") that restates the obvious, while ground truth uses a more precise closing ("No other tasks..."). These are minor but introduce stylistic drift under strict scrutiny.
  - **Conciseness and Fidelity (-0.5)**: Extra text and structure make it slightly verbose and less faithful to the ground truth's minimalist style, violating "utmost strictness" for even small deviations.

Overall, the response is highly faithful in substance but loses points for non-essential embellishments and format mismatches, preventing a perfect score.
