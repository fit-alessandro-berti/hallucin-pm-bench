6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (Core Correctness, 7-8/10 range base)**: The LLM answer accurately identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h 95th; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quoting figures verbatim from the table. No extraneous content (e.g., service times, other activities, or throughput) is included. The memo is crisp, under 150 words (~110 words), and focuses solely on waiting times as required.
  
- **Weaknesses (Significant Deductions for Differences from Ground Truth, -1.5 total)**: 
  - **Action Recommendations (-1.0)**: While logically tied to waiting times and promising ≥20% reductions, the actions are entirely different from the ground truth (e.g., automated reminders/escalations vs. digital portal; e-signature replacement vs. AI generation; rules-engine pre-classification vs. triage system). Ground truth provides specific, data-backed estimates (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%"); LLM's are generic "targeting 20%+" without such evidence, violating "data-driven" depth and introducing major content divergence.
  - **Format and Style (-0.5)**: Ground truth uses a concise, numbered bullet-point structure with verbatim phrasing (e.g., "avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h"). LLM opts for a formal memo with bolding, subheaders, and an extraneous closing paragraph ("Immediate action... efficiency"), adding fluff not in ground truth and deviating from its minimalist tone. Small stylistic mismatches compound under strict evaluation.

Overall, factual accuracy supports a mid-score, but strict adherence to ground truth's content (especially actions) demands deductions for these clear differences.
