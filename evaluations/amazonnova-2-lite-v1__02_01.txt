**7.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Scoring):
- **Q1**: Exact match (3 distinct cases: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). +2.0
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" immediately before "Ship_Order" in A-9321). +2.0
- **Q3**: Exact match (earliest timestamp: 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00). +2.0
- **Q4**: Exact match (2 occurrences of "Quality_Check"). +2.0
- **Q5**: Major error. Expected ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] (activities never first in any case; firsts are "Receive_Order" x2, "Quality_Check" x1). LLM only lists 1/3 correctly ("Ship_Order"), missing "Validate_Order" and "Pack_Items". Significant deduction for incompleteness/inaccuracy in list. +(-1.0) → partial credit 1.0

**Total: 7.0/10.0**. Perfect JSON format and 4/5 questions exact, but Q5 substantially incomplete (failed to fully reconstruct per-case sequences/first events from shuffled log), warranting strict ~30% penalty per instructions.
