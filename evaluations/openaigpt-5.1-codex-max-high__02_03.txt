**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match in content, conciseness, and correctness:
- Q1: Correct count ("3 distinct cases" precisely answers "how many distinct cases"; listing cases is unrequired by prompt and adds no value).
- Q2/A2: Exact match ("Pack_Items").
- Q3/A3: Exact match ("Cancel_Order").
No errors, deviations, or omissions relative to ground truth substance; format adheres to "concise, bullet-point answers only."
