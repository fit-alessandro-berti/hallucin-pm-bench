7.0

- The main errors are formatting and minor deviations from the prompt requirements:
  - The headings are not verbatim; the LLM answer has leading dashes (“- ADDED TASKS”), while the ground truth does not, which is not strictly following instructions.
  - The list formatting for tasks and gateways omits the list hyphens at the start of each line (e.g., “Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)” instead of “- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)”).
  - For GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, the ground truth has indented gateways (hyphens and alignment), while the LLM answer omits both.
- The content (element IDs, names, and gateway changes) is otherwise strictly correct, and no extra commentary or omissions were present.
- Significant points are lost for the formatting, as the prompt asks for the specification and headings “verbatim and in this order,” and to follow a precise format.
