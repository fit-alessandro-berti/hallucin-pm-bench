8.0

The LLM answer is functionally correct, with all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), removed tasks (Task_ManualReview), and gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel; Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel) matching the ground truth exactly in content, IDs, names, and format for entries. No extra commentary or unchanged elements are mentioned, adhering to the prompt's rules.

However, under strict evaluation, the formatting differs significantly from the ground truth and the required verbatim headings: 
- Headings include extraneous leading "-" (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS" instead of plain "ADDED TASKS"), violating the "verbatim" instruction.
- List items lack the bullet points ("- ") present in the ground truth, presenting them as unbulleted lines.
- Minor misalignment in the ground truth for the second gateway (extra spaces) is absent but not required, so neutral.

These formatting inconsistencies, though small, warrant a deduction of 2.0 points for not matching the expected output structure precisely.
