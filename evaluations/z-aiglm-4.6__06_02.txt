The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth in content, structure, and identification of the concurrent task sets from Process B only. No extraneous tasks, processes, or sequential elements are included. The only potential discrepancy is minor trailing whitespace in the ground truth (two spaces at the end of lines 1 and 2), which does not affect semantic accuracy and is not considered an error under strict evaluation criteria focused on task enumeration.
