The LLM answer is factually perfect, correctly identifies both counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11), uses precise citations including accurate timestamps from the log, and follows the "No" + one-paragraph format exactly as prompted. Minor deductions for small stylistic differences from ground truth: inline phrasing without bullets or bolding, inclusion of timestamps (accurate but extraneous to ground truth citations), and slightly less emphatic closing ("is violated" vs. explicit "**not always**" proof statement), reflecting strict evaluation of phrasing variances.
