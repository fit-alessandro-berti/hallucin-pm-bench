**7.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Scoring):
- **Q1 (20% weight)**: Exact match (3). **+2.0**
- **Q2 (20%)**: Exact match ("Pack_Items"). **+2.0**
- **Q3 (20%)**: Exact match timestamp. **+2.0**
- **Q4 (20%)**: Exact match (2). **+2.0**
- **Q5 (20%)**: Significant error. List includes correct items ("Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") but erroneously adds "Quality_Check", which **does** appear as the first event in case C-77 (only event in that case). JSON schema requires precise content; unsorted OK but extra/incorrect item violates "meticulous" fact-only rule from system prompt. **+1.0** (partial credit for 3/4 correct items identified).

**Total: 7.0/10.0**. Perfect on scalars/timestamps; strict penalty (-1.0 full points for Q5) for factual misread of case C-77 despite shuffled log requiring per-case reconstruction. No other deviations (e.g., format valid JSON).
