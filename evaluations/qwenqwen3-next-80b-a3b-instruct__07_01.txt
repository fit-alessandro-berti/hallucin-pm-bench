6.5

Reasoning:
- The LLM answer correctly lists the actual added and removed tasks, and the gateway type change, and does not add any extraneous information.
- HOWEVER, it fails to specify the task ids, instead using only the names ("Check Customer VIP Status" etc.) rather than e.g. `"check_vip"`, whereas the ground truth explicitly includes both name and id.
- In the gateway type changes, the LLM answer gives the correct element id and change, but its format differs: it outputs "gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway" rather than the explicit "‘gw_valid’ changed from exclusiveGateway (v1) to inclusiveGateway (v2)". The explicit version is clearer and matches instruction to "use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML" (the LLM answer omits the backticks and some formatting).
- The required headings are not matched exactly (LLM uses bullets; ground truth uses bold and italics). This is a lesser fault but should be reflected in a strict grading.
- The LLM answer omits the instruction to write "(none)" if no changes exist, but since each category has changes, this is not penalized here.
- Overall, the missing ids and less explicit format are significant accuracy losses and would be counted as multiple small but substantial errors for strict evaluation.
