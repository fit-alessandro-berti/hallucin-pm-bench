8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences: the two added tasks by name, the one removed task by name, and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`. Headings match the prompt exactly, including bullet styles. No speculation or extraneous content is added, and "(none)" is appropriately omitted where categories have items.

However, under strict evaluation criteria, there are notable differences from the ground truth:
- **Added and Removed tasks**: The LLM lists only the `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status"), while the ground truth includes both names and explicit `id` references (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," which could reasonably include IDs as unique identifiers for elements, but the LLM omits them entirely. This is a small but significant omission, as IDs are factual XML elements distinguishing precise changes.
- **Gateway type changes**: The LLM's concise phrasing ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway â†’ inclusiveGateway") captures the essence but differs in structure and detail from the ground truth's more explicit version specification ("`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"). While not incorrect, this lacks the versioning context present in the ground truth, introducing a minor divergence.
- **Formatting and completeness**: Bullet styles differ slightly (* vs. -), and the ground truth includes a closing note ("(No other differences should be reported.)"), which the LLM omits. These are trivial but contribute to non-exact alignment under utmost strictness.

Overall, the answer is highly accurate and adheres to the prompt's core requirements (factual, grouped, no speculation), warranting a strong score. However, the omissions and phrasing variations result in a 2.0-point deduction from a perfect 10.0 for not fully mirroring the ground truth's detail level.
