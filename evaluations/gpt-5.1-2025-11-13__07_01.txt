The LLM answer accurately identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive) without speculation or extras, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements and the ground truth's core content. Minor deductions for formatting variances (e.g., id-first vs. name-first ordering, inclusion of XML angle brackets, quoted names, and slight wording/phrasing differences in the gateway description) and absence of the ground truth's closing note, per strict evaluation criteria. No errors in facts or completeness.
