8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). No deductions.
- **Question 2a**: Perfect match (2.08%, correctly calculated and rounded). No deductions.
- **Question 2b**: Perfect match (8.33%, correctly calculated and rounded). No deductions.
- **Question 3**: Partial match. Correctly identifies low-support issue and risks to analyses (e.g., skewing metrics, limited generalizability, bias), but superficial: fails to explicitly mention "single occurrence" (core requirement), lacks note on variance/instability (e.g., noise, wide confidence), and omits caution on over-generalization specifics (e.g., unreliable conclusions from one case). Under 100 words and on-topic, but lacks depth required for full credit. Significant deduction for omissions.

Overall: Strong on facts (1-2), weaker on explanatory precision (3), leading to moderate score under strict criteria.
