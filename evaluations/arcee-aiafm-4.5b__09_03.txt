The LLM answer correctly identifies that computation is impossible due to insufficient data but introduces significant inaccuracies and deviations from the ground truth. It falsely claims "one occurrence" of "Approve Invoice" in the stub (when the artefact explicitly states every row and timestamp is redacted, providing zero visible events or data), inconsistently describes the sample size as "zero (only one event)", and structures the response in unrequested steps rather than a single precise paragraph. These errors in factual interpretation and formatting reflect a misunderstanding of the redacted artefact, warranting substantial deduction despite the overall correct conclusion of impossibility.
