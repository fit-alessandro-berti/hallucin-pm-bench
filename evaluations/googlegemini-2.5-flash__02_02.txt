9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Factually correct (3 distinct cases), but includes unrequested enumeration "(C001, C002, C003)", which adds extraneous detail not in the ground truth. Minor deviation (-0.5).
- **Q2**: Content exactly matches the sequence and separator usage. However, includes unnecessary spaces around each "→" (e.g., "Receive_Order → Check_Stock"), unlike the ground truth's direct concatenation without spaces. Small formatting error (-0.5).
- **Q3**: Content exactly matches (both activities listed, alphabetically ordered: Arrange_Delivery then Check_Stock). However, lacks the leading dashes ("-") and uses plain line breaks instead of "<br>" tags as in ground truth. Minor formatting deviation (-0.0, as prompt specifies "one per line" without mandating dashes or HTML).
- **Overall**: Factually precise with no hallucinations, missing, or incorrect elements. Deductions only for strict adherence to ground truth formatting/wording; high score reflects near-perfect alignment despite nitpicks.
