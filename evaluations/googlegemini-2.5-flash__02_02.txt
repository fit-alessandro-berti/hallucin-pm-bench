9.0

**Evaluation:**

- Q1: Correct (“3” and lists correct cases).
- Q2: Correct sequence, correct format, spelling matches the log.
- Q3: Lists “Arrange_Delivery” and “Check_Stock”, in correct order, but omits the required underscores ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" should have underscores per log/event names; the answer uses spaces instead).

**Reason for Deduction:**
While the factual content is 100% correct, the answer uses "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" with spaces in Q3, rather than the precise naming ("Arrange_Delivery", etc.) used in the log and required by the instructions. Using spaces instead of underscores is a minor formatting error, but per "utmost strictness", even small errors warrant a deduction.

-1 point for incorrect formatting on Q3.

**Final Score:** 9.0
