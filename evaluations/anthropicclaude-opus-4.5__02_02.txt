**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all questions, with no errors, missing elements, fabrications, or hallucinations:
- **Q1/A1**: Correctly identifies 3 (minor phrasing "3 distinct cases" vs. "3" is semantically identical and directly echoes the question; no deduction under strict factual precision).
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match, including order, activities, and → separators (escapes in ground truth are Markdown artifacts, irrelevant to content).
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), correctly identified per case, alphabetically ordered, one per line as instructed. Reasoning supports this without introducing errors.

Explanatory text is accurate, non-fabricated (e.g., correctly cites lines/timestamps/predecessors), and enhances clarity without deviating from ground truth answers. Format differences (headers, code block vs. bullets) are stylistic, not content errors. Full match under line-by-line factual evaluation.
