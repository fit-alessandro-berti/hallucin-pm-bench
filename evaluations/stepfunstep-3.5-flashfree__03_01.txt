**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Line-by-Line Comparison)
The LLM answer captures the high-level process flow and loop correctly but introduces **significant structural and fidelity errors** relative to the ground truth (GT), violating "exactly as stated" and "do not invent or add ... activities". With utmost strictness, even minor naming/attribute diffs deduct heavily; the extra task alone is a major hallucination (-3+ points). Total diffs exceed 30% of elements/flows.

#### Major Errors (-4.0 cumulative):
- **Invented extra activity (t6 "Resolve Issue")**: LLM adds a 2nd `task id="t6"` exclusively for specialist path (f10: t5→t6→f11:t7). GT reuses single `t4` "Resolve Issue" for *both* agent/specialist "Resolve Issue" (f9: t5→t4). This fabricates an unmentioned distinct activity, despite line 6 reusing the name. +2 extra flows (f10/f11). Core violation of "do not invent activities".
- **Specialist path connection wrong**: LLM t5→t6→confirm; GT t5→t4→confirm. Shifts confirm ID (t7 vs t6).
- **Missing <?xml declaration>**: GT has it; LLM omits.

#### Medium Errors (-1.5 cumulative):
- **Task name mismatch**: t1 "Classify Ticket" vs GT "Auto-Classification" (ignores "automatically ... by the system" in line 2).
- **All conditions differ**: LLM uses invented `${ticketType=='Password Reset'}`, `${action=='resolve/forward'}`, `${confirmed==true/false}` (9 flows affected). GT uses simple `"yes"`/`"no"`. gw1 "else" flow f4 lacks condition (default); GT explicit `"no"`.
- **Process attrs**: id="p" (no name) vs GT id="support_ticket" name="Support-Ticket".

#### Minor Errors (-0.5 cumulative):
- **Missing descriptive names** (GT has on *all* start/gws/end; LLM omits on start/gw1/gw2/gw3/end).
  - gw1: GT "Password Reset?"
  - gw2: GT "Resolved Internally?"
  - gw3: GT "Customer Confirms?"
  - start/end names.
- **Definitions header diffs**: Extra `xmlns:xsi`, `id="defs"`, targetNamespace="http://acmetech.org" vs GT's "http://acmetech/support". No `xsi` NS.
- **ID shifts/flow count**: LLM 14 flows (f1-f14), shifted targets (e.g., f5 t2→t7); GT 13 flows (f1-f13).

#### Positives (no deduction):
- Correct loop (gw3 "no" → t3).
- Two exclusive gateways (gw1/gw2).
- Core tasks present (matching names where not erred).
- Password path skips to confirm (both skip explicit "resolve"; arguable per desc but consistent).
- <40 lines, concise IDs, no diagrams/forbidden adds (timers/escalations/parallel).

Semantically ~80% aligned, but XML fidelity poor (extra elements, mismatches). Equivalent to "close but fabricated"—strict score reflects GT as exact benchmark.
