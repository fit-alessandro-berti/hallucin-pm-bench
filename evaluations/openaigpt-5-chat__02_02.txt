10.0

The LLM answer is completely correct and matches the ground truth with no errors or omissions. Here is the justification by each answer:

- **Q1/A1:** Clearly and unambiguously states there are 3 distinct cases, matching the ground truth.
- **Q2/A2:** Correctly lists the activities for case "C002" in the correct order, using the required separator ("â†’") and with no extraneous activities.
- **Q3/A3:** Accurately identifies the set of distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" across all cases ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock"), orders them alphabetically and outputs them as one per line.

The LLM also provides intermediate reasoning, but the final answers sections distill exactly what is required and match the ground truth. No hallucinations or errors are present. Thus, the only fair score is **10.0**.
