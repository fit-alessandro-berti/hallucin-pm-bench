10.0

The LLM answer is factually precise, complete, and directly matches the ground truth across all three questions without any errors, omissions, additions of incorrect information, or fabrications. Q1 is exact (3). Q2 is verbatim identical in sequence and formatting. Q3 correctly identifies and lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line. Explanatory steps aid clarity but introduce no discrepancies or hallucinations; the unsolicited graph offer is irrelevant but harmless and does not alter the scored content. Under utmost strictness, this warrants a perfect score as no differences exist in the core responses.
