### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (9/10)**: Activities ranked correctly (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability). Waiting times quoted verbatim (avg and 95th percentile) with no extraneous metrics (e.g., no service times or other activities mentioned).
- **Structure and Constraints (8/10)**: Crisp memo format under 150 words (~100 words). Focuses strictly on waiting times and recommended actions as required. Minor deduction for added summary sentence ("These actions target..."), which is unnecessary but not violative.
- **Action Relevance and Quality (6/10)**: Each action is logically tied to waiting-time issues and claims ≥20% reduction, but lacks the "data-driven" depth of the ground truth (e.g., no references to pilots, estimates, or specifics like "24h escalation" or "rules-engine"). Actions are concrete but vaguer and less innovative/specific, reducing alignment—e.g., #2's "optimize batch processing" vs. ground truth's targeted e-signature replacement; #3's "standardize protocols" vs. pre-classification bypass. Strictness applied: these gaps represent meaningful differences in precision and evidential support, warranting significant point loss.

Overall, strong on facts and compliance but penalized for suboptimal action specificity per the ground truth benchmark.
