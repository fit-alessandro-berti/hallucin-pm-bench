GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES  
Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel  
Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel

**Justification:**  
All changes are correctly identified, and no extra or missing elements are present.  
However, the formatting does not match the ground truth:  
- The required list-marker hyphens ("- ") before each entry are missing.  
- There is an extra blank line between each group and between items in a group, rather than the ground truth’s compact style.  
- The gateway changes should have list-markers and exact spacing as shown in the ground truth (notably: spacing and indentation for Gateway_Payment).  
Because adherence to required format and exact presentation was demanded (and emphasized to score strictly), these small but concrete deviations bring the score down by 2 full points.
