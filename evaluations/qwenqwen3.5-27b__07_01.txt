### Evaluation Rationale
**Factual correctness**: Perfect (10/10). LLM correctly identifies the added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway change (`gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive).

**Differences from ground truth (strict deductions)**:
- **Task listings (major error, -2.0)**: Uses only IDs; omits names ("Check Customer VIP Status", "Generate RMA QR Code", "Send RMA Label") which appear exactly in XML `name` attributes. Ground truth pairs name + `(id = ...)`. Violates "use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML" if interpreting as `name` values.
- **Formatting/structure (-1.0)**: Plain lines under headings vs. ground truth's `*` bullets, **bold** headings (no `•`), backticks `` ` ``, and parenthetical `(v1)/(v2)`.
- **Gateway phrasing (-0.5)**: Correct but terse ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway changed to inclusiveGateway") vs. precise "* `gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)". Misses explicit v1/v2 versioning.
- **Missing note (-0.5)**: No "(No other differences should be reported.)".
- Matches prompt's "exact headings" with `•` better than ground truth, minor offset (+0.0 net).

**Overall**: Core facts match but presentation/content omissions and mismatches deduct heavily per strictness rule. Not a close replica.
