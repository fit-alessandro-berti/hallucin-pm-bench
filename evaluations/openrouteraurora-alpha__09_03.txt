9.2

The LLM answer is highly accurate and adheres closely to the task requirements: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to absent data (no rows/timestamps in Artefact A), explicitly lists all requested metrics (average cycle time, std dev, 95% CI), explains precisely why computation fails (no start/complete times for durations/variability/confidence), stays within one short paragraph, uses no outside knowledge/guesses, and references only supplied artefacts. Minor deductions (-0.8) for: slightly less direct quotation of artefact details (e.g., omits "column headers" and exact "start_time / complete_time" phrasing); uses first-person "I cannot" vs. ground truth's impersonal "Impossible —"; adds "purely speculative" (unnecessary but harmless); says "each case" vs. ground truth's precise "any execution" (subtle inaccuracy as logs may have multiple events per activity per case). Overall, excellent but not identical under utmost strictness.
