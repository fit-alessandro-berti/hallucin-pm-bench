The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in content, accurately identifying the impossibility due to redacted event log data (no rows or timestamps in Artefact A), explicitly covering the inability to compute average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% CI, and providing a precise explanation without guessing or external knowledge. Minor deduction for structuring the response in numbered points rather than a single concise paragraph as implied by the task's instruction for the explanation, slightly deviating from the ground truth's format while still being functionally equivalent.
