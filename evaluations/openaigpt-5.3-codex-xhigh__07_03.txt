The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with perfect matching content, structure, headings, task listings, and gateway change descriptions. The sole difference is minor formatting: lack of alignment spaces after the colon in the second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"). Under utmost strictness for small errors, this cosmetic whitespace discrepancy warrants a 0.5-point deduction from perfection.
