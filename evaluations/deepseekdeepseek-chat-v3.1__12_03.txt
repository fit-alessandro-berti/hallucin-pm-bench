The LLM Answer is correct in its primary conclusion ("No") and clearly justifies its stance by referencing the relevant CaseIDs and explicitly describing the sequences for C002 and C004 where intervening activities occur. It directly explains that these cases violate the "always" claim, thereby invalidating the FACT.

However, points are lost for not fully matching the format and completeness of the ground truth answer. Specifically:

- The ground truth provides a concise table, covering all cases (including those where the rule does hold), which gives a clearer, more complete account.
- The LLM answer does not mention C001 and C003, which are counterexamples supporting the negative answer and demonstrate that immediate succession is not universal but does occur.
- The LLM's justification is slightly less structured and comprehensive than the ground truth's, lacking systematic application to each case.

While accurate and generally well-justified, the answer omits some thoroughness and clarity present in the ground truth, warranting a deduction.
