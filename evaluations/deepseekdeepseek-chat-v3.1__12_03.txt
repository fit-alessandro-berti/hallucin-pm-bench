9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate by answering "No" and providing a valid justification focused on counterexamples (Cases C002 and C004), accurately citing timestamps and sequences from the log to demonstrate violations of the "always" claim. This suffices to disprove the universal rule without fabricating evidence, aligning with the task's requirement to cite relevant CaseIDs and sequences.

However, under utmost strictness, the response loses 1.0 point for incompleteness: it does not explicitly verify or cite the non-violating cases (C001 and C003, where Validate_Payment does follow immediately), unlike the ground truth's exhaustive case-by-case analysis. While not erroneous, this omission reduces thoroughness in a meticulous process-mining context, where confirming all instances strengthens the justification for the "always" negation.
