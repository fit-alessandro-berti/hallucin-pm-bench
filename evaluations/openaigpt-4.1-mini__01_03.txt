### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Part (a): Decision Points Summary
- **Strengths**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two actual decision points (the conditional skip in step 4 and the TriVote gate in step 6) in one sentence each, with rules closely matching the ground truth (e.g., "Low or Medium *and* €250,000 or less" for the skip; "any two out of three" for TriVote, equivalent to "at least two").
- **Errors**: 
  - Incorrectly includes the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (step 3) as a "decision point," describing it as assigning a risk rating. This is not a decision point or conditional branch per the prompt and ground truth—it's an input step producing data for the actual decision (the skip/branch in step 4). This adds an extraneous, inaccurate item, altering the count from 2 to 3 and misrepresenting the process.
  - The summaries are numbered and formatted as a list, but the ground truth uses a more concise, unnumbered structure without labeling step numbers explicitly. While not critical, this deviates slightly from the "one sentence each" precision.
- **Impact**: Adding a non-decision point is a substantive error, inflating the list and potentially confusing the process flow. Under strict criteria, this warrants a ~40% deduction from full marks for this part (effective accuracy ~60%).

#### Part (b): Documents List
- **Strengths**: Correctly lists Form 14B (step 1), Deck Memo (step 5), Offer Sheet 77 (step 7), Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8), ID Matrix Declaration (step 8), and Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9) in first-appearance order. Treats Signed Offer Sheet 77 as distinct (as in ground truth). No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions).
- **Errors**:
  - Omits the three scorecards (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow) entirely, despite them being explicit "inputs" (i.e., required documents) first appearing in step 3's Tri-Color-Risk-Check. The ground truth lists them as the 2nd–4th items, making this a critical ~33% omission (3 out of 9 documents missing).
  - Lists only 6 items vs. ground truth's 9, disrupting completeness. Formatting includes step references, which ground truth omits for brevity, but this is minor.
- **Impact**: Missing core process documents (the scorecards are integral to the risk check) is a major factual gap, directly violating "list **all** documents." Strict evaluation deducts heavily (~50% loss for this part, effective accuracy ~50%).

#### Overall Assessment
- The answer is structured clearly and responsive but undermined by key inaccuracies: an extra/misclassified decision point in (a) and omission of essential documents in (b). No policy violations or hallucinations beyond the process, but strictness demands significant penalties for these differences (total ~50% accuracy). The polite framing ("Certainly! ... let me know!") is unnecessary but harmless. A higher score would require near-exact alignment to ground truth structure and content.
