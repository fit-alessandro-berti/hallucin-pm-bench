6.0

a) Decision points:
- The LLM answer correctly identifies both key decision points (risk-based skip and TriVote) and their rules in concise sentences. However, it includes "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" as a decision point, when in fact, the risk-scoring itself is not a decision/branch but generates an input for the conditional branch immediately after. This is a structural error, adding a false decision point. It does accurately capture the logic of both main gates, though, so the core substance is mostly correct, but the answer introduces mild confusion by misclassifying the risk check as a "decision point".

b) Document list:
- The LLM omits the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are required inputs to a process step (the risk check), and are listed in the ground truth. This is a significant omission—Scorecards are documents explicitly named in the process and required for logic to function. All other documents are present and in the correct order, but the omission of the Scorecards is a substantial gap, and thus a major mistake.

The answer does avoid hallucination and otherwise uses exact terms, so there are no points lost there, but the Scorecard omission and the structural error in part a) must result in a significant deduction.

Strictly: clear structure and terminology, two substantive flaws (one logic, one omission) → 6.0.
