The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and precision: it correctly identifies the redaction of data rows and timestamps in Artefact A as the sole barrier to computing the metrics, specifies the need for start/complete times relevant to "Approve Invoice," and limits explanation to a single short paragraph without speculation. The only minor deductions are for slightly less formal phrasing (e.g., "Cannot compute" vs. "Impossible") and not explicitly using "dispersion" or suggesting additional data needs, which are stylistic rather than substantive errors but warrant a small point loss under strict evaluation.
