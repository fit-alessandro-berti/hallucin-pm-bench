The LLM answer deviates entirely from the ground truth by proposing an invalid process rewiring (changing sourceRef and introducing a new sequenceFlow ID, which exceeds allowed modifications like attribute tweaks or single flow reversal), uses a non-standard and malformed diff format instead of unified diff, fails to preserve all activity elements unchanged, and offers a rationale that ignores dueDate adjustments central to SLA compliance, resulting in zero alignment with the expected simple attribute fix.
