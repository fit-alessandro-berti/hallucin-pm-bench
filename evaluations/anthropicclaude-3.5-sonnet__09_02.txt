9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in identifying the core issue (lack of timestamps preventing duration calculation), but it loses a slight edge due to minor phrasing differences: it uses "cannot be determined" instead of "impossible to compute," omits explicit reference to "event counts" and "duration information," and does not emphasize the absence of "start-to-completion intervals." These small omissions make it marginally less precise under strict evaluation, warranting a deduction from a perfect score.
