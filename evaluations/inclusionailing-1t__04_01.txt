### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately pinpoints the key violations in Rules 2 and 3 with precise event citations, aligning closely with the ground truth. It also correctly assesses Rules 1, 4, and 5 as satisfied. However, under strict evaluation criteria, the following differences and errors warrant a deduction:

- **Structural differences (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: The ground truth provides a systematic, numbered justification (1-5) exhaustively covering *each* rule in sequential order, with clear "Satisfied" or "Violated" labels and a concluding summary tying back to the violations. The LLM answer deviates by prioritizing violations (starting with Rule 2), grouping Rules 1 and 5 together in a single point, and using a less organized numbering (1-4 instead of 1-5). This reduces clarity and fidelity to the expected format of a comprehensive, rule-by-rule analysis.

- **Factual inaccuracy in Rule 4 (significant deduction: -1.0 points)**: While both conclude Rule 4 is not violated (correct, as no direct CFO-to-Intern succession occurs), the LLM incorrectly states the Intern activity (event 7) is "separated by two other events (steps →4 and →5 executed by System)." In reality, *three* events intervene (4: System, 5: System, 6: Warehouse_Clerk), and event 6 is not by System. This miscount and role misattribution is a clear error, even if it doesn't alter the compliance outcome. The ground truth more accurately notes separation via event 4 (implying non-directness) without such factual slips.

No other major content errors exist, but these deviations from the ground truth's precision and structure prevent a higher score under utmost strictness.
