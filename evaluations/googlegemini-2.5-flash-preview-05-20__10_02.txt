5.0

The LLM answer follows some instructions accurately but contains several significant mistakes when compared to the ground truth, and should thus lose substantial points, especially under a strict grading policy:

**Positives:**
- The enforced synonyms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") are used and not substituted.
- The RACI format is in Markdown and clearly organized.

**Major Issues:**
1. **Role Omission:** The "Operations Manager" role, present in the ground truth, is missing entirely from the LLM answer.
2. **Inaccurate RACI Assignment:**  
    - The ground truth separates "Responsible" (R) and "Accountable" (A), while the LLM repeatedly assigns both (R, A) to a single role, which is often improper per RACI best practice (there should be only one "A" per step).
    - Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles are misapplied or missing in several steps.
    - For instance, “Release Payment” assigns C to IT Support improperly, while ground truth assigns C.
    - “Screen Payment Against Sanctions List”: LLM makes Transaction Analyst both R and A, whereas ground truth splits A to Regulatory Liaison.
    - The step for notification after archival is split out, which is not reflected as a separate “task” in the ground truth.
3. **Task Naming:**  
    - Several task step names in the LLM answer diverge subtly but importantly from the ground truth mandated wording, e.g., "Archive Case File" vs "Archive Record".
    - Some activities from the ground truth (“Receive Payment Instruction”, "Screen Against Sanctions List", etc.) are not named precisely.
4. **Number of Steps:**  
    - The ground truth compresses the process into 6 steps; the LLM answer expands it to 8, splitting out “Notify on Case File Archival,” which is not listed as a discrete activity.
    - The “SWIFT message” step is not matched exactly in naming or mapped properly in consultation/informed terms.
5. **Legend:**  
    - The ground truth provides an explanatory legend for the RACI codes, which the LLM answer omits.

Given the above, despite correct use of the mandated vocabulary, repeated assignment of dual R/A, omission of a required role, errors in RACI mapping, task naming drift, and lack of a legend, the answer can receive at most a 5.0.
