9.0

The LLM answer is quite close to the ground truth and presents all the required categories and specific changes, with the following minor deviations:

- It lists the technical IDs before the task names rather than the other way around, but this is not a content error.
- In "Gateway-type changes," it includes the name change ("name changed from 'Eligible?' to 'Eligibility Check'"). The prompt specifies "ignore cosmetic renamings" so this point should NOT be mentioned.
- The formatting differs slightly (lack of bolding, numbering), but that's not a content issue.

Given the instruction for "utmost strictness," the unnecessary mention of name changes in the gateway section is a clear, albeit small, error. According to the rules, "even small errors should reflect in significant loss of points." Therefore, despite the rest of the answer being correct, the score should be notably below perfect but still strong due to the otherwise correct content.

**Final score: 9.0**
