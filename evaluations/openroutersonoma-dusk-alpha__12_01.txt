8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the fact is not accurate and gives a justification that closely examines the relevant cases and the sequence of activities—accurately referencing the order in cases 1001 and 1003, and noting the absence of "Update_Inventory" in 1002.

However, there are a couple of minor issues resulting in point deductions:

1. The LLM answer slightly misstates the claim; it says "*always occurs immediately before*", but in the final evaluation, it only focuses on the order, not specifically on the "immediacy" (i.e., whether "Authorize_Refund" is *directly* before "Update_Inventory" with no intervening activity). In reality, "Update_Inventory" never follows "Authorize_Refund," immediately or otherwise.
2. The LLM writes: "Case 1002 lacks 'Update_Inventory' entirely, providing no counterexample but also no support for the claim across all cases." This misses a subtle but critical nuance: the ground truth articulates that *lack of occurrence* of "Update_Inventory" already disproves the "always" in the claim, which is a stronger logical point.
3. The LLM could be clearer and more precise, as the ground truth states: "Since in none of the three cases does Authorize_Refund immediately precede Update_Inventory, the statement is false." The LLM answer doesn’t summarize its findings quite as conclusively.

These small omissions result in a deduction of 2 points under strict grading, leading to a final score of 8.0.
