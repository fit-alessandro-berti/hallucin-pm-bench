The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides accurate counterexamples for cases 1001 and 1003, including timestamps for evidence. However, it loses points for incomplete reasoning on case 1002: it notes the absence of "Update_Inventory" but fails to explicitly state how this disproves the universal "always" claim (as in the ground truth), instead weakly framing it as "no support" without tying it to the logical failure of the statement. This omission weakens the justification's rigor. Minor structural differences (e.g., no explicit "verdict" header, less emphasis on "none of the cases" matching the claim) further deduct under strict evaluation, though the core refutation remains solid.
