**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, +1.0 base)**: Uses exactly "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring". No leaks of disallowed terms.
- **Structural violations (major deductions, -4.0)**:
  - Added unauthorized activities: "Approval (for Risk Scoring >70)", "Schedule Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst" (direct violation of "do not ... add activities"; ground truth has exactly 6 rows, LLM has 8).
  - Renamed activity: "Approval (for Risk Scoring >70)" ≠ "**Compliance Officer Approval**".
  - Header mismatch: "Activity / Role" ≠ "Activity".
  - No bolding on activities or R/A as in ground truth.
  - Uses "-" instead of "–" for no involvement.
  - Conditional text "(if >70)" in cell (non-standard RACI; explanatory, not pure).
- **RACI content mismatches (pervasive errors, -3.0)**: Nearly every cell differs (e.g., Intake Vetting misses Treasury "I", Front-Office not "R,A"; Risk Scoring misses Front "C"/Treasury "I", conditional "A"; no rows match ground truth fully; extras have no ground truth equivalents).
- **Coverage (partial, +0.0 net)**: Covers mandated 4 activities but fails "every activity and role described" accurately without additions/merges.
- **Overall**: ~75% deviation in structure/content; strict policy breach on additions/renaming outweighs vocab fidelity. Minimal credit for partial mapping.
