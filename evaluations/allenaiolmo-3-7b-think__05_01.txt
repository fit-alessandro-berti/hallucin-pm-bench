**1.0**

The LLM answer fundamentally fails to address the SLA: it skips **Task_Triage** entirely by routing to **End_Done**, violating the requirement to reach "Triage Claim" within 48h or auto-escalate (implying escalation ensures reaching it). Invalid BPMN: StartEvent cannot host a boundary timer; "compensating event" is non-standard/vague, not a precise event like ground truth's interrupting boundary timer. Wrong target path (End_Done vs. Task_Triage). No XML details (e.g., PT48H). Misinterprets escalation as termination. Major semantic/technical errors warrant minimum score.
