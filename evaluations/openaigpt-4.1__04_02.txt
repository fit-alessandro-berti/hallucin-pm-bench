6.0

- The LLM answer matches the ground-truth for the following rules:  
  - R1: Correct status and justification  
  - R3: Correct status and justification  
  - R4: Correct status and justification  
  - R5: Correct status and justification (but justification omits Pay_Invoice, not ideal but partially correct)  
  - R6: Correct status and justification

- The critical error is R2:  
  - LLM says **Compliant**, but should be **Violated**.  
  - Justification ignores the post-Change_Request Manager_Approval; should have been compared to that approval.  
  - This is a major logic error.

- Minor issues:  
  - Justifications are sometimes less precise than ground truth (R5 omits that both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred prior to new Manager_Approval, but references at least one process step).
  - Slightly verbose in places but within word limits.

- Conclusion, based on the "utmost strictness" the grade is significantly lowered due to the (critical) R2 error.  
- All other points are fully correct or have minor omissions, but R2 is a crucial compliance failure.

Final evaluation: **6.0/10**
