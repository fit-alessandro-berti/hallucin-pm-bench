The LLM answer is mostly structured correctly and identifies the overall non-compliance accurately, but it commits a critical error in R2 (incorrectly deeming it compliant by ignoring the interaction with R5's new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07, which makes Ship_Goods untimely and premature). This misclassification of a key violation, combined with a slightly incomplete R5 justification (omits Pay_Invoice as a prohibited step), warrants substantial deduction under strict criteria despite alignments elsewhere.
