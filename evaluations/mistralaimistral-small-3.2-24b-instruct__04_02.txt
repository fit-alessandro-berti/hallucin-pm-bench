The LLM answer correctly identifies compliance for R1, R3, R4, and R6, with appropriate statuses and concise justifications. However, it errs critically on R2 (incorrectly deems compliant, ignoring post-change approval timing) and R5 (incorrectly deems compliant, overlooking pre-approval steps like Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice), missing two key violations. Overall result is directionally correct but understates violations, reflecting incomplete analysis. Strict evaluation demands deduction for these substantive inaccuracies.
