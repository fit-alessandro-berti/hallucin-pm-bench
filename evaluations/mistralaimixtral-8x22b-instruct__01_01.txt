**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (full credit areas)**: Required documents list is **identical** in completeness and conditional notes (e.g., *AuditTrail* for high-value), matching ground truth exactly (7 items, no extras/intros). No introduction of undefined activities/artefacts. Covers process accurately overall.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences)**:
  - **Decision points summary**: Major structural/content mismatch. Ground truth explicitly identifies **3 precise decision points** ("Eligibility check", "**Amount threshold** *after* Finance_Controller_PreApprove", "Final payment approval *at* PreApprove/Senior") in table format with exact branching logic. LLM lists **3 activity-named points** but:
    | Issue | Impact | Deduction |
    |-------|--------|-----------|
    | Folds "**Amount threshold**" into Finance_Controller_PreApprove outcome (wrongly attributes amount decision *to/in* Finance step, vs. ground truth's *after* as separate #2). Process explicitly lists branch *after* step 3. | Misattributes explicit decision point; incomplete "every decision point" coverage. | -1.5 |
    | Treats Finance/Senior as separate granular decisions vs. ground truth's combined "Final payment approval". No explicit "amount threshold" entry. | Alters branching logic summary; less precise. | -0.5 |
    | Narrative bullets vs. table with "Branching logic/outcomes" column; assumes reject paths similarly but less tabular/exact. | Formatting/precision diff (minor but strict loss). | -0.5 |
    | No final note "(No other documents or legacy...)" emphasizing constraint adherence. | Minor omission of ground truth's explicit disclaimer. | -0.5 |
  - Total deductions: -3.0 from 10.0 → **7.0**. Even "small" diffs (format, omission) cause outsized loss per instructions; core misplacement is not small.
- **Overall**: High fidelity (~80% match) but strict content diffs in decision points prevent 8+. Perfect documents offset some loss.
