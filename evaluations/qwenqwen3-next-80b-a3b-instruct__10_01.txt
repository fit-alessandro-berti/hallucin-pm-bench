6.0

**Assessment:**

**Terminology Compliance**:  
- The answer uses “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” exactly as mandated. No forbidden terms occur.  
- Roles are referenced by abbreviations per the process (AM, CO, FC, IT), which is acceptable since the prompt encouragements, though the ground truth spells out role names in the table headers.

**Structure & Unwarranted Content**:  
- The LLM answer introduces a Legend and an affirmative call-out about terminology. While not harmful, it is somewhat unneeded given rubric preference for no extra content.

**Major Issues (Point Deductions):**  
- **Attribution Errors**:  
   - *Receive Application*: Ground truth shows AM as both Responsible and Accountable (R / A), CO as Consulted (C), FC and IT as Informed (I).  
     - LLM says AM Responsible, CO Accountable, FC and IT Informed.  
     - This is a mismatch: AM should be both R and A, and CO should be Consulted (C), not Accountable (A).
   - *KYC Review*: Ground truth gives CO Responsible, AM Accountable, FC Consulted, IT Informed.  
     - LLM makes CO Responsible, AM Informed, FC Accountable — **wrong Accountable party, missing Consulted**.
   - *Order Vetting*: Ground truth has AM R/A, CO C, FC I, IT I.  
     - LLM assigns AM Responsible, FC Accountable, CO and IT Informed — **wrong accountable, missing consulted**.
   - *Payment Clearance*: Ground truth gives FC Responsible, AM Accountable, CO Consulted, IT Informed.  
     - LLM: FC Responsible, IT Accountable, AM and CO Informed. **Accountability misplaced**.
   - *Record Update*: Ground truth has IT Responsible, FC/AM Consulted, CO Informed.  
     - LLM: IT Responsible, AM Accountable, rest Informed — missing appropriate Consulted assignments.
   - *Notify Customer*: Ground truth has AM R/A, rest I.  
     - LLM: AM Responsible, rest Informed (misses Accountability).

- **RACI Model Simplification**:  
   - The LLM answer collapses "R" and "A" (Responsible and Accountable) into single roles per row, never marking "R/A" in one cell, and omits "Consulted" (C) markers entirely.  
   - The ground truth, in contrast, uses "R/A" when a user is both, and includes "C" (Consulted). The LLM also does not include "C" in its legend, and does not utilize it at all.  
   - This results in major deviations from the specific role allocations in the ground truth.

- **Formatting**:  
   - Table formatting is acceptable (activities as rows, roles as columns).

**Conclusion:**  
- The LLM answer correctly complies with vocabulary policy and provides the correct high-level activities.
- However, it fails to capture the correct, specific RACI role assignments (especially "Accountable", "Consulted", and "R/A" cases), which constitute critical deviations per the prompt's rubric.
- Omitting all "Consulted" (C) assignments and misallocating "Accountable" leads to a substantial loss of points.

**Final score: 6.0** (acceptable structure and terminology, but substantial loss for RACI misallocations and omission of "Consulted" and double-duty "R/A", warranting a much stricter grade).
