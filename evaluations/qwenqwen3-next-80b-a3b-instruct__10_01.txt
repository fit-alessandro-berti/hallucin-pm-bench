3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Adherence (Positive, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This matches the ground truth and prompt policy perfectly.
  
- **Format and Structure (Partial, +1.0 point)**: The output is a valid RACI matrix with activities as rows and roles as columns. Abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) align with the prompt's role listings, and the table is clear. However, the ground truth uses full role names, and the LLM introduces bolding inconsistencies (none in LLM vs. selective bolding in GT for key cells). The legend is useful but unwarranted (GT has no legend), and the trailing ✅ note is extra content not in the GT, violating "no unwarranted content" in the rubric. Minor deductions for these additions.

- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, -6.0 points)**: This is the core failure, with significant deviations from the ground truth, leading to a low overall score under strict evaluation. The narrative implies specific responsibilities (e.g., AM handles Receive Application and Notify Customer; CO performs KYC Review; AM checks Order Vetting; FC initiates Payment Clearance; IT refreshes Record Update), and GT reflects this with exactly one Responsible per activity, AM as Accountable where appropriate, and appropriate Consulted (C) roles. LLM mismatches include:
  - Missing "C" (Consulted) entirely—legend only covers R/A/I, replacing C with I or A in several spots (e.g., GT has CO=C for Receive Application, but LLM has CO=A; GT has FC=C for KYC Review, but LLM has FC=A).
  - Incorrect Accountables: E.g., Receive Application (GT: AM R/A, CO C; LLM: AM R, CO A—wrong A assignment); KYC Review (GT: CO R, AM A, FC C; LLM: CO R, FC A, AM I—swaps A to FC, demotes AM); Order Vetting (GT: AM R/A, CO C; LLM: AM R, FC A—unwarranted FC A, CO I vs. C); Payment Clearance (GT: FC R, AM A, CO C, IT I; LLM: FC R, IT A, AM I, CO I—shifts A to IT, demotes AM/CO); Record Update (GT: IT R, AM C, FC C; LLM: IT R, AM A—upgrades AM to A, FC I vs. C); Notify Customer (GT: AM R/A; LLM: AM R only—misses A designation).
  - No combined R/A notation as in GT for AM-led activities.
  - While each activity has one Responsible (matching rubric), the overall allocations do not "reflect the narrative" accurately, with unwarranted I/A shifts (e.g., FC/IT over-involved).

- **Overall Correctness and Unwarranted Content (Penalties Applied)**: No extra tasks/roles/columns, which is good, but the RACI errors compound to make the matrix substantively incorrect vs. GT. Small errors (e.g., no self-awareness needed, but extra legend/note) amplify losses under strictness. Total reflects ~35% alignment: terminology/structure solid, but RACI fundamentally flawed.
