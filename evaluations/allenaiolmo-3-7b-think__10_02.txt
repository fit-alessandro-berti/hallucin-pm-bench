**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses *only* mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"). No forbidden terms like "CDD" or "Compliance Officer".
- **Table format/structure (major failure, -3.0)**: Non-standard RACI layout (responsibility types as columns instead of roles as columns). No "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header, no legend, awkward empty cells, bolding absent. Markdown valid but deviates heavily from ground truth.
- **Task coverage and wording (major differences, -2.0)**: 8 tasks vs. ground truth's 6; unnecessary splits (e.g., separate "Send SWIFT message", "Notify Regulatory Liaison"); wording mismatches (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" adds details not matching "**KYC Review**"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"). Misses exact phrasing and consolidation.
- **Roles (major failure, -1.5)**: Missing "Operations Manager" entirely; only TA, RL, IT Support. Ground truth requires 4 roles.
- **RACI assignments (total mismatch, -1.5)**: Completely different distributions (e.g., simplistic single-role R/A per task vs. nuanced multi-role with OM as primary A; no matches like TA C/RL R/OM A/IT I for KYC Review). Ignores ground truth logic.
- **Overall fidelity/extras (deduction)**: Covers source text more granularly but ignores ground truth's exact tasks/assignments. No post-table notes.

Net: Significant deviations across all criteria justify low score despite vocab adherence. Small errors (e.g., task wording) compound to major losses per instructions.
