**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision points (major deductions: ~4 points lost)**: LLM identifies only 2 decision points vs. ground truth's 3 (misses entirely the "Final payment approval" at Finance_Controller_PreApprove/Senior_Auditor_Review with approve/reject outcomes). Partial matches on first 2: lacks explicit outcomes (e.g., "Not eligible → rejected"; "≤ €1 000 → skip"), imprecise location ("after Finance_Controller_PreApprove" omitted), no table structure or branching logic column, simplified phrasing without bolded activity names or exact wording. High-value mislabeled loosely as "activity" without full context.
- **Required documents (minor deductions: ~1 point lost)**: Lists all 7 correctly with accurate conditional note for AuditTrail; extra activity links are factual but deviate from ground truth's plain numbered list without activities or end-note disclaimer. Minor: "Documents/Artefacts" header pluralizes unnecessarily vs. "documents".
- **Overall structure/content fidelity**: Headers/titles differ; no table; less precise summaries; no legacy disclaimer. Strict penalty for incompleteness (missing decision), detail gaps, and format divergence despite prompt fidelity otherwise. ~60% match justifies 6.0.
