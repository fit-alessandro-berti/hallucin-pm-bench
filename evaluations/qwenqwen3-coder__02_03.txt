The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content (correct distinct cases, preceding activity, and unique activity) and uses the requested bullet-point format. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (rephrasing questions in bullets instead of bare answers) and added styling (bold/italics/quotes), which deviate from the "concise" instruction and ground truth's minimalism, but do not introduce errors.
