**1.0**

The LLM answer is entirely incorrect on all three questions:
- Q1: Claims 4 cases (wrong; ground truth is 3: C123, C456, C789).
- Q2: Nonsensical response unrelated to C456's preceding activity (should be Pack_Items).
- Q3: Fails to identify the single-occurrence activity (Cancel_Order); instead gives irrelevant info.

No alignment with ground truth format or facts; maximal deviation.
