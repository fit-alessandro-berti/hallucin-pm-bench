The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets from Process B in the proper order, with no extraneous information about other processes and accurate task names. It matches the ground truth in core content and structure (numbered sets), but deducts slightly for minor differences: added introductory sentence (not in ground truth), nested sub-labeling under "Parallel Split" (vs. ground truth's simpler "Set X – [description]"), bullet-point formatting with bolding (vs. ground truth's backticks and ‖ symbol), and omission of the closing statement about no other parallel tasks. These are small presentational variances under strict evaluation, but the response is highly faithful overall.
