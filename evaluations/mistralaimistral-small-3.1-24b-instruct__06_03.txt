10.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth answer in both content and structure. It:

- Focuses strictly on Process B as requested.
- Lists the two sets of concurrently executable tasks, numbered in order of appearance.
- Matches the grouping and task names exactly with the ground truth.
- Does not add extraneous information about Processes A or C.

While the LLM answer includes extra headings ("Parallel Split #1", "Parallel Split #2"), this does not conflict with the strict requirements, as the numbering and concurrent sets are correctly identified. No inaccuracies are present; therefore, a perfect score is warranted.
