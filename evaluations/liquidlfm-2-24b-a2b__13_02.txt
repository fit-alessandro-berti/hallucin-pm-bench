**10.0**

The LLM answer is a near-perfect match to the ground truth. 

- Q1: Exact match (**1**).
- Q2a: Exact (2.08%, with equivalent calculation shown).
- Q2b: Exact (8.33%, with equivalent calculation shown). Minor formatting (space in "%" vs no space) is negligible.
- Q3: ≤100 words (35 words); covers all required criteria—(i) single occurrence explicitly stated, (ii) variance/instability via "small, unrepresentative sample," "skewing," rare/case-specific implying noise/unreliability, (iii) caution on over-generalization to models/performance/predictions. Process-mining relevance implied without invention; no contradictions.

Strict evaluation confirms no errors, only stylistic alignment with deterministic numerics and flexible explanation criteria.
