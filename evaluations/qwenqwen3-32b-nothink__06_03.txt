The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks and numbers them in the correct order, exactly as required. It omits extra details about Processes A and C, as instructed. However, it does not provide explicit mention of "first/second parallel block" or clarify "no other tasks can run in parallel," which the ground truth includes for fullness and clarity. These are minor differences, but they warrant a small deduction for utter strictness and not fully mirroring the labeling and final clarification of the ground truth.
