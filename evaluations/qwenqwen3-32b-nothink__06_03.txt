The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel sets with the exact tasks in the proper order, aligning semantically with the ground truth. However, it loses points for minor formatting differences (e.g., no explicit "Set" labels, descriptive block names, or parallelism symbols like â€–; uses commas and bold instead of code-style notation) and omits the confirmatory sentence about no other parallel tasks, which adds clarity in the ground truth. These small deviations warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria, though the core content is precise and adheres to the prompt without extraneous information.
