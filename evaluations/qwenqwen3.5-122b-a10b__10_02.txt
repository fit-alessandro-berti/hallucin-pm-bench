2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -3.0)**: LLM uses 3 columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support); GT uses 4 (adds Operations Manager). LLM has 8 rows (extras like "Send SWIFT Message", "Notify on Case Closure"); GT has exactly 6. Headers/titles/legend notes in LLM absent in GT and add extraneous content.
- **Activity Naming Mismatches (Significant Deduction: -2.0)**: LLM: "Log Transfer Instruction" vs GT "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Conduct KYC Review" (extra "Conduct") vs "**KYC Review**"; "Approve High-Risk Transaction" (singular) vs plural; extras not in GT; "Archive Case File" vs "Archive Record". Violates strict mandated wording adherence.
- **RACI Assignments Completely Divergent (Critical Deduction: -2.5)**: No row matches GT exactly. E.g., KYC: LLM (RL R/A only) vs GT (TA C, RL R, OM A, IT I); Screen: LLM (TA R/A) vs GT (TA R, RL A, OM I, IT C). LLM overuses R/A combos and empties cells; GT distributes C/I/A fully. Ignores GT's heavy Operations Manager accountability.
- **Format/Compliance Issues (Deduction: -0.5)**: Combined "R / A" vs GT's separate bolded letters. LLM notes "C not applicable" (false per GT, which uses C extensively). Minor extras like numbering, date, "prepared by".
- **Strengths (Partial Credit: +1.0)**: Uses mandated terms (KYC Review, etc.). Markdown table. Attempts to cover source steps without omissions (though splits incorrectly).

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 2.0 for overwhelming mismatches. Even partial alignments fail under "utmost strictness" where small errors cost significantly.
