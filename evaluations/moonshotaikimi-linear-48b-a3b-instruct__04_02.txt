4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Format Adherence (20% weight)**: The LLM response includes extensive unrequested reasoning and analysis before the final formatted output, violating the prompt's requirement for a concise structure (rules with status/justification ≤20 words, then overall result). The final section matches the expected list format closely but is preceded by verbose text. Ground truth is clean and table-formatted (though table not strictly required). Partial credit for correct final structure. (-1.5 points from max 2.0)
  
- **Content Accuracy per Rule (60% weight)**: Strict comparison to ground truth:
  - R1: Matches status (Compliant) and core justification (Manager then Finance for >€10k). Minor phrasing differences but ≤20 words. Full credit.
  - R2: Major error—status wrong (Compliant vs. Violated); justification incorrect (ignores post-Change_Request new approval on 07-Mar, treats initial Finance_Approval as "last," and miscalculates timing relative to expedited rule). This misinterprets rule interplay with R5. No credit. (-1.0 full point loss)
  - R3: Matches status (Violated) and justification (Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods). Phrasing similar (e.g., both note date violation). Full credit.
  - R4: Matches status (Not Applicable) and justification (hazardous=false). Full credit.
  - R5: Matches status (Violated); justification similar (post-approval Change_Request without prior new Manager_Approval before processing like Ship_Goods). Ground truth adds Pay_Invoice explicitly, but LLM covers key violation (Ship_Goods). Minor omission, but acceptable. 0.8/1.0 credit.
  - R6: Matches status (Compliant) and justification (ends with Archive_Record). Full credit.
  - Overall: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but LLM implies only R3/R5 violations, missing R2. Partial credit. (3.3/6.0 total)

- **Justification Length & Precision (20% weight)**: All ≤20 words (verified: R1=10, R2=11, R3=13, R4=10, R5=13, R6=12). Precise and rule-focused where correct, but R2/R5 have small inaccuracies in nuance (e.g., R5 omits Pay_Invoice). (-0.3 from max 2.0)

- **Overall Strictness Notes**: One critical rule error (R2) due to flawed analysis of approval sequence post-Change_Request, plus extraneous reasoning text, warrant major deductions. Even minor deviations (e.g., R5 phrasing) deduct noticeably. Total reflects ~70% alignment but with high-impact flaws.
