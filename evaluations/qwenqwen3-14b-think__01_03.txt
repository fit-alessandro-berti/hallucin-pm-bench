6.0

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision points**
- The LLM answer is accurate in identifying and describing the **two main decision points** and their rules; wording is slightly less formal but meets the intent.  
- **No significant factual error** but the description could be tighter. For the TriVote, it does not explicitly say "must have at least two approves"—though "any two approvals...to proceed" is acceptable.
- Minor markdown structure differences, but that's not penalized.

**b) Required documents**
- Here the LLM shows a significant gap:
    - It OMITS **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow**, which are listed in the ground truth as required documents (even though the prompt says they are *inputs*, the ground truth considers them as required documents).
    - It also omits **Signed Offer Sheet 77**.
- The LLM EXPLICITLY justifies excluding the Scorecards because they are not "labeled as documents," but the ground truth includes them. This is a substantive deviation.
- The rest of the sequence and naming are correct.

**Summary of strictness:**  
- Missing four required documents from the ground truth list: Scorecard–Cyan, -Magenta, -Yellow, and Signed Offer Sheet 77 (out of 9, about 44% missing).  
- Decision point wording is nearly correct, but not superior to ground truth.

**Overall:**  
- Major errors in the document list despite a solid showing for the gating steps.

**Deduction:**  
- Because more than 40% of required documents are missing, maximum grade can be **no higher than 6.0** even with correct flow elsewhere.

**Final Score: 6.0**
