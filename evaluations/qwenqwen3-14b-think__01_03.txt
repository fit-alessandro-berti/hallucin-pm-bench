4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 7.0/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies both decision points and summarizes the rules concisely, aligning closely with the ground truth in structure and key elements (e.g., conditions for skipping Step 5 and the 2/3 approval threshold). However, it loses points for minor inaccuracies: (1) omitting the explicit "otherwise proceed to Step 5" clause, which is stated in the ground truth; (2) phrasing the TriVote as "any two approvals... to proceed" without matching the ground truth's precise wording ("at least two... record 'Approve'") or the process's "suffice to pass"; (3) adding unnecessary step references ("@ Step 4", "@ Step 6") not in the ground truth, which slightly deviates from the "one sentence each" requirement. These small errors warrant a deduction under strict criteria.

- **Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 2.0/10)**: This section has critical omissions and errors, leading to a major deviation from the ground truth. The LLM misses four required documents entirely: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow (explicitly listed as inputs in Step 3, treated as documents in the ground truth and required for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check); and Signed Offer Sheet 77 (distinctly specified in Step 8, separate from the unsigned Offer Sheet 77 in Step 7). The LLM's exclusion of scorecards (justified in a note as "not explicitly labeled as documents") contradicts the ground truth's inclusion and the prompt's directive to list **all** required items "anywhere in the process." It also fails to differentiate Signed Offer Sheet 77, resulting in only 5 items vs. the ground truth's 9, in incorrect order/sequence. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions), but incompleteness is a severe flaw.

- **Overall (Weighted Average: 4.5/10)**: Part (a) is mostly accurate but imperfect; Part (b) is substantially incomplete, driving the score down significantly per the strictness guideline. The response is well-formatted but does not fully or faithfully capture the process as defined.
