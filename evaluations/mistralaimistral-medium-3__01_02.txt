### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major partial match, but significant omissions and incompleteness; ~60% alignment)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two primary branching points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with accurate core logic (e.g., score difference threshold and amount-based routing). However, it omits the third explicit decision point from the ground truth—the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as a standalone vote (approve/reject). It also lacks contextual positioning (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which the ground truth includes for clarity and fidelity to the process flow. The Underwriter Alignment description implies the ≤2 continuation but does not state it explicitly, making it less precise. This results in a substantial gap in completeness and strict adherence to the prompt's summarization requirement.
  
- **Required Documents (near-exact match, but minor wording variances; ~95% alignment)**: The list is complete and uses exact names/forms from the process description, with no additions or omissions. However, small but noticeable differences in phrasing reduce precision: e.g., "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"; "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" omits "Latest" streamlining but adds "single" not in ground truth; "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes "template" absent in ground truth. The note is thematically similar but not identical (e.g., LLM mentions "credit-bureau pull" while ground truth specifies "credit bureau report, collateral forms"). Under strictness, these phrasing inconsistencies deduct points despite the overall accuracy.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: The response follows the prompt by using exact activity names and avoiding standard terminology. Structure is clear (headings, numbering/bullets), but the ground truth's more detailed, positioned summaries make the LLM version feel abbreviated. No introduction of extraneous content, but the missing decision point and incomplete details violate "summarise" completeness, warranting a mid-range score with deductions for strict criteria.
