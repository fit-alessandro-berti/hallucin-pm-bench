6.0

**Reasoning:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies the **Underwriter Alignment Gate** and the **Amount Threshold Decision** as decision points, using the exact activity names.
- All required documents are accurately listed, using nearly exact names, in the correct format. 
- The LLM clearly avoids introducing standard loan terminology or irrelevant documents.

**Errors/Omissions (strict evaluation):**
1. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) decision not counted as a decision point:**
   - The LLM omits the explicit listing of the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a decision point where the board votes *approve* or *reject*. This is a major omission, as the Ground Truth includes it as the third decision point.
2. **Amount Threshold Decision placement imprecision:**
   - The LLM does not clarify that the **Amount Threshold Decision** occurs *after* the **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**. While not explicitly incorrect, the sequence is less precise than the ground truth. 
3. **Too brief and lacks direction of outcomes:**
   - The LLM answer states only "If the two risk scores...escalate..." but omits the "If ≤2 points, continue" pathway.
   - For **Amount Threshold Decision**, it only mentions what happens for ≥ €15 000, not the auto-approve for < €15 000.
   - This reduces decision logic completeness and clarity compared to ground truth expectations.
4. **Required Documents:**
   - The listing is accurate but slightly less precise (CIS is described as "template" by LLM, while ground truth omits "template"). Minor, but per instructions, even small deviations should have notable impact.
5. **Lack of process context:**
   - The LLM answer leaves out where each decision point fits in the process flow, as the ground truth includes (e.g., "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").

Given these gaps—especially the missing **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a decision point and lack of full decision logic direction—a markdown to 6.0 reflects strict adherence to instructions, with relatively significant penalties for each deviation.
