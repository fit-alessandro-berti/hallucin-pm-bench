The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides accurate justification by citing the relevant CaseIDs (C001, C002, C003, C004) and sequences, directly matching the ground truth's factual content and counterexamples. It implicitly covers all cases by noting the exceptions and the fitting ones, confirming the "always" claim is false. Minor deduction for less structured presentation (no table) compared to ground truth, but no factual errors or omissions.
