8.0

The LLM answer is accurate about the main point: it correctly answers "No" and appropriately cites cases C002 and C004 as violations of the stated fact, giving the correct sequences for those cases and briefly noting when the rule does and does not hold.

However, in contrast to the ground truth:

- The LLM answer does not systematically address each case (C001–C004) in detail. It omits explicitly confirming that C001 and C003 do have the immediate relationship.
- There is no tabular or structured breakdown, which helps clarity and completeness.
- The justification is briefer and does not explicitly mention the total number of violating cases versus compliant cases.
- The LLM answer refers to “several cases,” which is slightly imprecise—explicit enumeration and clear counts would be stricter.

Thus, due to minor but important omissions in completeness, systematicity, and presentation (all stressed by the ground truth), I deduct 2 points. The core content is accurate, but not as thorough or precise as the gold standard.
