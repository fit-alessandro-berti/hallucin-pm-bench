**7.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1 (weight ~20%)**: "1" matches exactly (GT: "`1` occurrence"). Minor omission of "occurrence" deducts 0.2. **Score: 9.8**
- **Q2 (weight ~20%)**: "5.56%" correct calculation (1/18 ≈ 5.56%). Formatting lacks space before % (GT: "`5.56 %`"), deducts 0.3. **Score: 9.7**
- **Q3 (weight ~20%)**: "A1002" correctly lists the sole case ID. Less verbose than GT ("Only case **A1002**..."), missing emphasis/bold/quotes; deducts 0.5 for not fully matching phrasing. **Score: 9.5**
- **Q4 (weight ~40%, highest for reasoning)**: Provides two valid *sampling-related* reasons (sample size + temporal, aligning with GT options). However:
  - Sample size reason contains **factual error**: Claims "50% of cases" (1/4 = 25%, derivable from log: cases A1001–A1004). This is hallucinated math, not directly from log, violating "no inference" policy. Changes ±25pp impact, not 50%. Significant deduction (-2.5).
  - Temporal reason solid (single day bias), matches GT "Temporal bias".
  - Bullet formatting good, but error undermines reliability example (GT emphasizes precise variance like "±5.56 pp"). **Score: 6.0**

**Overall**: Strong adherence to log (no extra events inferred), correct counts/cases/percentage. Major ding for Q4 math hallucination (strict policy: "any deviation... reveals hallucination"), plus minor formatting/verbosity. Weighted average yields 7.2 (not 10 due to strictness on even small-but-significant errors).
