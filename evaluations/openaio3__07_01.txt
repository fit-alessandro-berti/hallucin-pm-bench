8.0

The LLM answer is extremely close, listing all correct differences and matching the element IDs under each heading. However, two significant deviations from strict requirements are present:

1. The LLM answer lists only element IDs for tasks but omits task names â€” the ground truth specifies to list both the task name and ID (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Thus, important factual information from the XML (the `name` attribute) is missing.
2. The ground truth uses a more explicit format* ("name (id = ...)"), which is significantly more informative for change-log comparison and unambiguously ties IDs to their user-facing activity names.

Gateway change description and removed/added task IDs are all factually correct, and there is no extraneous or speculative content.

Because of the missing task names (an important field in the XML and ground truth), a significant penalty applies, resulting in 8.0.
