### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer is strong in completeness and fidelity to the process description (no introductions of undefined elements, accurate document list matching the ground truth exactly, including the conditional note on *AuditTrail*). However, it incurs point losses for the following differences and errors relative to the ground truth:

- **Decision Points Summary (major deviations, -2.0 points total):**
  - Identifies 5 decision points instead of the ground truth's precise 3, over-splitting elements (e.g., treats **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** and **Senior_Auditor_Review** as separate decisions rather than bundling into a single "Final payment approval"; adds **Process_Refund_Payment** as a distinct "decision" based on constraints, which the ground truth integrates into the approval logic without listing it separately).
  - Lacks explicit "branching logic / outcomes" for each point (e.g., no mention of rejection paths like "*Not eligible* → claim rejected" or "*Rejected* → process ends without payment," which are core to the ground truth's summary).
  - Introduces interpretive details not in the prompt or ground truth (e.g., "Implicitly depends on results of **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**," "no separate artefact is defined," phrasing like "gatekeeping via constraints") – these are small but extraneous additions that dilute a strict summary.

- **Structure and Prompt Adherence (moderate issues, -0.5 points):**
  - Mixes document details into the decision points section (e.g., listing "Documents used" per point), whereas the prompt requires summarizing decision points *and* separately listing all required documents. The ground truth keeps them cleanly separated (table for decisions, bulleted list for documents).
  - Uses a verbose numbered list with subheadings instead of the ground truth's concise table format, making it less precise and tabular in summarizing branching.

- **Document List (no loss):**
  - Matches the ground truth verbatim in content, order, and notes (including the legacy activity disclaimer).

The answer is helpful and accurate in substance but not a tight match to the ground truth's focused, minimalistic structure and exact decision-point count/logic, justifying deductions from a potential 10.0.
