The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in structure, key facts, and justification, correctly identifying "No" as the response and citing the same counter-examples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order). However, under utmost strictness, it incurs minor deductions for small differences: (1) unnecessary inclusion of the Cancel_Order detail at line 12, which adds extraneous information not present in the ground truth and could slightly dilute focus; (2) minor phrasing variations in the conclusion (e.g., "does not always follow" vs. "does **not always** follow" with emphasis, and "log fragment" vs. "provided log"); and (3) subtle formatting inconsistencies (e.g., no bolding on "No" and different bullet-style omission). These small deviations prevent a perfect score despite the substantive match.
