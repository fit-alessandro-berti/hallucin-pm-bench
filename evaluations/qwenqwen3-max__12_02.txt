The LLM answer matches the ground truth closely in structure (starting with "No" and providing a one-paragraph justification citing cases and lines), factual accuracy (correctly identifies the same two counterexamples in C003 and C005 with precise line references), and logical conclusion (both emphasize that these instances disprove the "always" claim). Minor deductions for slight stylistic differences, such as the LLM's additional phrasing ("directly contradicting" and "conclusively invalidate") which adds emphasis but deviates from the ground truth's more concise wording, and a tiny rephrasing in C005 ("without any preceding Receive_Order at all" vs. "never contains Receive_Order at all"), though these do not introduce errors.
