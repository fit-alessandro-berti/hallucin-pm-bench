6.0

The LLM answer correctly lists the three explicit parallel blocks (P1, P2, P3) matching the ground truth exactly in content and numbering for those lines. However, it introduces significant errors by adding invalid lines 4 and 5: line 4 incorrectly presents the sequential task "Dry_Fit_Assembly" (which follows P2, not P1, and is not parallel) as a concurrent set, directly violating the prompt's instruction to "exclude any tasks that must run sequentially." Line 5 is entirely fabricated and irrelevant, speculating on non-existent parallelism. The appended **Note** adds unsolicited explanation, deviating from the required format of "numbered lines" only. These extraneous, factually incorrect elements (factual error on P1 completion, inclusion of sequential/non-parallel tasks) represent multiple violations under utmost strictness, resulting in substantial point deduction despite the correct core content. Perfect match would be 10.0; this partial adherence with clear deviations merits 6.0.
