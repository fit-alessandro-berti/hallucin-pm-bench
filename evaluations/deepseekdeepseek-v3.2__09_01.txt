**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in core conclusion ("cannot be derived/computed"), reasoning (no timestamps/durations available; redacted/excerpt lacks them; benchmark inapplicable/irrelevant), and adherence to instructions (clear statement it cannot be derived; brief explanation). Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed"; explicit benchmark rejection) are stylistic, not substantive errors, and both avoid fabrication. No loss of points warranted under strict evaluation.
