2.0

- The LLM answer is entirely incorrect on Question 1 (it answers "No" while the correct answer is "Yes").
- The explanation given, while detailed, is fundamentally flawed: it does not recognize the alternative firing sequence where T5 can fire before T3. In fact, it claims, incorrectly, that such a firing sequence is impossible.
- For Question 2, the answer does not provide a firing sequence and instead explains incorrectly why no such sequence exists.
- The only credit that can be given is that the explanation attempts to discuss dependencies and some structure of the net (showing superficial understanding of Petri nets), but both the conclusion and supporting detail are wrong against the ground truth.
- Even small errors should be penalized. Here, both the main logical requirement and the example sequence are fully missed. Only minimal points are awarded for effort at explanation and partial reading of dependency.

Thus, 2.0.
