The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1, claiming "No" with a flawed explanation that misinterprets dependencies (e.g., ignoring the path via T2-T7-T4 that marks P5 independently of T3 while P2 remains available). It provides no valid sequence, contradicting the ground truth's clear "Yes" and explicit minimal firing sequence demonstrating T5 preceding T3. This reversal of the core fact warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation.
