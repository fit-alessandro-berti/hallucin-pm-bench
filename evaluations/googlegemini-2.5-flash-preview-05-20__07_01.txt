6.5

The LLM answer is accurate in terms of semantics (it lists the correct additions, removals, and gateway type change), but it exhibits several issues that warrant significant point deductions according to the provided evaluation instructions:

- It fails to include the names of the added/removed tasks, listing only IDs. The ground truth requires both the task names and the IDs.
- The format deviates from the ground truth (it uses bullet points rather than the required bolded section headers and list formatting).
- It omits the ID for the changed gateway and does not clearly highlight the before/after types with boldface, as in the ground truth.
- Minor but strict deductions: category headers are not bolded, not clearly demarcated as sections.

Overall, the factual content is correct, but the lack of task names and exact formatting shows insufficient attention to strictness required.
