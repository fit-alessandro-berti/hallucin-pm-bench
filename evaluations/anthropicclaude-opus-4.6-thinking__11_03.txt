### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high alignment, preserving most points)**: Identical selection of top 3 activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment). Accurate quantification of SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s) matching throughput vs. SLA from table data. Joint emphasis on breaches + high waits (600s, 480s, 200s) with precise proportions (% of throughput: 67%, 80%, 67%—derived correctly, no invention). Bullet points *only* for recommendations (3 bullets, one per activity, data-driven via times/cases). Memo format (~170 words, close to 150). No absent activities/metrics. Core fulfillment perfect.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences/strictness)**: 
  - Format/header variances: Bold **MEMORANDUM**/Date/Re vs. ground truth's concise *To:/Subject* (-0.3).
  - Extra interpretive content: "Case attrition suggesting abandonment" (data shows dropouts but infers cause, minor invention; +% over like "50%" derived but absent from table/ground truth) (-0.3).
  - Intro phrasing ("stand out as worst performers") vs. ground truth's "materially breach... largest queues" (-0.1).
  - Recommendations differ entirely (e.g., LLM: "parallel workflows/add capacity" vs. ground truth: "rule-based pre-checks"; specifics like "50% reduction"/"480 cases" data-tied but not matching) (-0.1).
- No major violations (e.g., wrong activities/metrics/inventions beyond minor derivations). Ground truth also invents (e.g., "€25k", "35%", "4805 cases"—inaccurate sum, "April 2025"), so relative parity. Total deductions: -0.8 from 10.0.
