The LLM answer closely follows the mandated vocabulary and mostly interprets the process steps correctly, but has notable deviations from the ground truth deserving a significant point reduction:

**Major errors:**
- The RACI table omits the "Operations Manager" role, which appears in the ground truth and is essential for setting proper accountability.
- The Accountable ("A") party is set to "Regulatory Liaison" or "IT Support" for many tasks, while the ground truth consistently lists "Operations Manager" as Accountable (A) in all non-IT steps. Failing to specify a unique Accountable party per RACI best practice is a substantial process documentation error.
- Task wording is not always aligned with the ground truth (e.g., "Receive transfer instruction and log in system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record").
- "Send SWIFT message" is included as a separate task in the LLM answer, while the ground truth treats the technical release and archiving only.
- The legends ("R", "A", etc.) are not clearly provided in the LLM answer.

**Minor errors:**
- For KYC Review and High-Risk Approval, the Consulted and Informed parties are not always captured as in the ground truth (e.g., Transaction Analyst should be "C" for KYC Review, not "Responsible" or "Accountable").
- "IT Support" has mismatched roles in some steps compared to the ground truth.

**Strengths:**
- The strict vocabulary mandate is generally followed.
- The RACI matrix covers nearly all process steps.
- Markdown formatting is applied as required.

**Overall:** The absence of "Operations Manager" (a key RACI requirement for accountability), mismatches in responsibilities/accountabilities, slight mismatches in activity wording, and incomplete stakeholder notifications mean this answer, while solid in vocabulary, loses significant points for process structure and RACI rigor.
