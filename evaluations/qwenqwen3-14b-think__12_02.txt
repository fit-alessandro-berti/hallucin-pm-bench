7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the claim is false and cites relevant counter-examples using both line numbers and case IDs, in line with the ground truth. However, there are notable drawbacks affecting the score:

- The LLM states, "For case C002, Validate_Payment (line 5) occurs after Check_Inventory (line 4), not directly after Receive_Order (line 3)." This is misleading: the requirement is that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order (i.e., occurs anywhere later in the case, not necessarily immediately after or directly), but the LLM brings up the "directly" point, which is irrelevant and could confuse.
- The LLM does correctly identify C003 (Validate_Payment before Receive_Order) and C005 (Validate_Payment present, Receive_Order absent), which are the key, complete counter-examples.
- The reference to "directly after" suggests a misunderstanding of the temporal/following requirement, since "directly after" is stricter than "always follows."

These issues are significant but do not constitute a major logical errorâ€”rather, they show an imprecise justification and a slight misreading of the temporal relationship described by "always follows." The core of the answer is correct, but the confusion about immediacy lowers the score substantially. Additionally, the explanation is a little less clear and precise compared to the ground truth. For this strict standard, this merits a 7.5.
