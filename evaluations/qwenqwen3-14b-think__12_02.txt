The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false and starts with "No," matching the ground truth's core response. It also accurately cites counterexamples in C003 (Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order, lines 6-7) and C005 (Validate_Payment without any Receive_Order, line 11), which align well with the ground truth. However, it introduces a significant error by misinterpreting C002 as a counterexample, claiming Validate_Payment (line 5) does not follow Receive_Order (line 3) because it is "not directly after" Check_Inventory (line 4)â€”the claim only requires "follows" (i.e., occurs after), not immediately, so C002 actually supports the sequence rather than refuting "always." This factual inaccuracy in the justification distorts the analysis and deviates from the ground truth's precise focus on true counterexamples (C003 and C005), warranting a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria for even minor interpretive errors.
