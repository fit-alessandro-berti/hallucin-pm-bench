The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway) with no additions, omissions, or speculation, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it loses points for formatting inconsistencies: (1) presents IDs before names (reversing the ground truth's name-first order), (2) uses a concise arrow notation for the gateway change instead of the more explicit "changed from... (v1) to... (v2)" phrasing, (3) employs "-" bullets without asterisks or backticks around IDs as in the ground truth, and (4) lacks bolding on headings and the closing note "(No other differences should be reported.)". These small presentational deviations warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria, though the core accuracy remains high.
