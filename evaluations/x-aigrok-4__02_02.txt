9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth ("3"). Full accuracy, no deductions.
- **Q2**: Sequence of activities is factually correct (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order for C002, based on log lines 2, 5, 8, 10). Underscores in activity names match the log/prompt convention. However, strict deduction for minor formatting inconsistency: LLM uses "→" without surrounding spaces, while ground truth includes spaces (" → "). This is a small but noticeable deviation from the expected presentation, warranting a -0.5 point loss.
- **Q3**: Distinct activities immediately preceding "Ship_Order" are correctly identified (Arrange_Delivery from C002; Check_Stock from C001 and C003). List is alphabetical and one per line, matching prompt instructions. No extras, omissions, or fabrications. Ground truth uses bullet formatting ("- " and "<br>"), but prompt specifies only "one per line," so LLM's plain lines are acceptable. No deduction.

Overall: High fidelity to ground truth with only trivial formatting variance; scores 9.5 under utmost strictness for the Q2 spacing issue.
