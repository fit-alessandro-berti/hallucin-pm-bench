### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Concept Mismatch (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The LLM incorrectly places a timer on a non-existent direct sequence flow from "Verify Identity" to "Create Account" (actual flow routes through a gateway), failing to monitor the task's completion duration as required by the SLA. Ground truth uses a boundary timer on the target task for precise enforcement.
- **Flawed Integration of Existing Elements (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: Ignores the unused "Activity_AMReview" escalation task entirely, instead proposing a vague "escalation event" post-"Verify Identity" without connections, violating the "no new activities" rule. Ground truth reuses the existing task via a sequence flow.
- **Incomplete/Incorrect XML (Major Deduction: -1.5 points)**: Provides isolated `<bpmn:timerEventDefinition>` and `<bpmn:escalationEventDefinition>` snippets without full element context, attachment refs, or proper structure (e.g., no `<bpmn:boundaryEvent>` or sequence flow). Duration "P48H" is imprecise (BPMN standard is "PT48H" for time durations).
- **Output Format Violation (Minor but Strict Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Includes a multi-sentence descriptive explanation instead of "only the changed or added XML elements" plus a single justification sentence, repeating unnecessary narrative.
