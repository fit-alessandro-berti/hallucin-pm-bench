**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Count)**: Perfect match (exact count of 1, correctly identified in case 1002). No errors. (10/10)
- **Part 2 (Explanation)**: Core idea of small sample size aligns (~20% overlap), but significant deviations under strict criteria:
  - Misses quantitative specifics (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours span, 0%-7% frequency swing, wide CI, rare-event sampling error).
  - Omits key data-driven confounders (near-synonyms like "Automatic Fraud Check" and "Fraud Check (Automatic)", strict vs. fuzzy matching risks).
  - Introduces generic/speculative elements (selection/temporal bias, clusters/cycles, unseen confounders like loan type/demographics—not derivable strictly from data; violates "no speculation").
  - Structure/lists are clear and ≤120 words (~110), but content differs substantially from ground truth's precise, data-anchored focus.
  
Overall: Accurate but insufficiently precise/data-tied; ~30% content similarity justifies moderate deduction for differences.
