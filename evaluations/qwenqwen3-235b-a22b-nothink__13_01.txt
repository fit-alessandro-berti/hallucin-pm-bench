10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data for questions 1-3, with no hallucinations or inferences. For question 4, it provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons ("temporal bias" via limited time frame and "small sample size") that align directly with the specified ideal responses, without deviation or unjustified additions. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., concise listing in Q3, approximate symbol in Q2 calculation) are negligible and do not warrant point deduction under strict evaluation.
