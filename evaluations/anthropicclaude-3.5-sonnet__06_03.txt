The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, matching the core content of the ground truth (the exact tasks and their grouping). It adheres to the prompt by focusing solely on Process B, numbering the sets in order, and providing no extraneous information about other processes. Minor deductions for: (1) slight formatting differences (bullet lists vs. inline notation with â€– and backticks, which affects visual precision); (2) inclusion of an introductory sentence not in the ground truth; and (3) omission of the closing statement affirming no other parallel tasks, though this is not explicitly required by the prompt. These are small stylistic variances but warrant a strict point reduction under the guidelines.
