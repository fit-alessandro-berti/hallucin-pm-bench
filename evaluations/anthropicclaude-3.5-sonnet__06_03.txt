The LLM answer is concise, correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks in the required order, and does not include information about other processes. However, it does not use the exact wording and formatting of the ground truth answer (e.g., "â€–" symbol, the explicit statement "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," or bold set headings). While factual content is accurate, the lack of strict format matching and omission of the explicit negative confirmation warrants a significant, but not maximal, score reduction.
