8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Q1/A1**: Exact match (3). Full points. No differences.
- **Q2/A2**: Factual sequence is correct (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order), but includes extraneous prefix "C002: " not present in ground truth. This is a small addition (not a hallucination but unnecessary deviation), warranting a significant deduction under strictness rules: -1.5 points equivalent.
- **Q3/A3**: Content is factually precise (distinct activities: Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock; alphabetically ordered; one per line as prompted). However, format deviates from ground truth (plain lines vs. bulleted list with "- " and <br> tags), introducing a minor structural difference: -0.5 points equivalent.
- **Overall Structure**: LLM uses "Q#" labeling while ground truth uses "**A#**" in a table; minor but contributes to non-exact match: no additional deduction beyond above, as factual precision is prioritized.
- **Total Rationale**: 98% factual accuracy with small formatting/added-text errors leading to significant (but not total) point loss per instructions. No hallucinations, but strict line-by-line comparison penalizes deviations.
