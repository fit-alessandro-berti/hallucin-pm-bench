### Evaluation Rationale
- **ADDED TASKS**: Major incompleteness (missed `Task_NotifyCustomer (Notify Customer)` entirely, a verifiable addition in v2 XML). Incomplete formatting (omitted required `name` in parentheses for all; no bullet/list structure matching ground truth/prompt example). Partial credit for identifying two of three tasks, but strictness demands full accuracy—significant deduction.
- **REMOVED TASKS**: Identified the correct task, but omitted required `name` in parentheses (`Manual Review`). Minor formatting inconsistency (no bullet). Partial credit, but errors warrant deduction.
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: Correct for `Gateway_ReviewNeeded` (matches format and content). Completely incorrect for `Gateway_Payment` (v1 is `exclusiveGateway` with `Converging` direction; v2 is `parallelGateway` with `Converging`—change is `exclusive → parallel`, not "converging → converging"). Added forbidden commentary/explanation, violating "no commentary" rule. Half correct, but errors critically undermine.
- **Overall**: Strict adherence required; omissions, format deviations, factual error in gateway type, and extraneous text result in low score. No guessing/intentions evident, but verifiable differences mishandled. Total alignment ~30-40% with ground truth.
