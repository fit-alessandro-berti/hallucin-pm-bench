**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Completely incorrect. LLM claims **2** occurrences (falsely attributes to CaseIDs 1002 *and* 1003), but exact string **“Manual Fraud Check”** appears **only once** (CaseID 1002, 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z). Case 1003 has “Fraud Check (Automatic)”. Ground truth: "1". Zero credit.
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Partially relevant points (small sample, non-random, temporal bias), but ~40 words overemphasize wrong premise (2/3 cases vs. actual 1/3), ignores ground truth core (14 events/<2hrs, 0-7% swing, wide CI, rare-event sampling error, synonyms like “Automatic Fraud Check” distorting matching). Misses tiny-sample volatility and matching pitfalls. Underperforms significantly.
- **Overall**: Strict deduction for factual error propagating to explanation; minor valid insights prevent 1.0. Total word count compliant (~110).
