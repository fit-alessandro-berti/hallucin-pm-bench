6.0

**Justification of scoring:**

**Positive aspects:**  
- All four mandated terms (**"Intake Vetting"**, **"KYC Review"**, **"AML Screening"**, **"Risk Scoring"**) are used and correctly named in the matrix.
- Disallowed synonyms do *not* appear in the matrix or notes, which aligns with vocabulary policy.
- The matrix is in Markdown format.
- All activities and all roles are represented.

**Major issues and deductions:**  
- **Incorrect assignments of R/A/C/I:**
    - For **Intake Vetting**, the LLM assigns "I" to Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer, whereas ground truth assigns "C" (Compliance Analyst) and "–" (Compliance Officer). Treasury Ops is correctly marked "I".
    - For **KYC Review**, the LLM gives "C" to Compliance Officer, matching ground truth, but gives "I" to Front Office Analyst instead of "–".
    - For **AML Screening**, as above.
    - For **Risk Scoring**, LLM makes "R, A" both for Compliance Analyst, but ground truth makes the Analyst only "R" and the Officer "A" (a critical escalation/responsibility distinction). Front Office Analyst should be "C", not "I".
    - For **Compliance Officer Approval**, LLM includes "C" for Treasury Ops, but ground truth indicates only "I" for Front-Office Analyst, "C" for Compliance Analyst, "R, A" for Compliance Officer, and "–" for Treasury Ops.
    - For payment: LLM merges "scheduling" and "funds release" into "Treasury Payment Processing (Scheduling/Release)", whereas ground truth *strictly* separates "Release Funds" as its own activity. LLM also gives "I" to Front-Office Analyst/Compliance Analyst and "C" to Compliance Officer (whereas ground truth has "I"/"C"/"C"/"R, A").

**Other issues:**
- LLM adds combined or made-up activity labels like "Treasury Payment Processing (Scheduling/Release)", which is NOT allowed—ground truth instructions are to not merge, rename, or add activities. This is a direction violation despite being subtle.
- The order of some roles in RACI for each activity is inconsistent with the ground truth but less critical than activity/role mapping errors above.

**Summary:**  
All mandated vocabulary terms are respected and correctly rendered, but the specific mapping of role involvement is inaccurate for multiple activities, the "Risk Scoring" accountability is misassigned, and an unauthorized combined activity was used. These are all substantial process-governance violations. Strict evaluation requires severe scoring impacts for such errors.

**Hence, 6.0 is awarded**—recognizing strict adherence to vocabulary, Markdown structure, and activity coverage, but deducting large amounts for inaccurate RACI mapping and a policy violation in naming/merging activities.
