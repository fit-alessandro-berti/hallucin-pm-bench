4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
With utmost strictness, the LLM answer scores 4.0 due to multiple significant deviations from the ground truth, including incorrect RACI assignments across several cells, improper merging/renaming of activities, and formatting inconsistencies. While it correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms without synonyms, these errors compound to reflect substantial non-alignment. Key issues:

- **Activity Names and Structure (Major Deduction)**: 
  - Merges "schedule the payment" (low-risk path) and "releases the funds" into one activity ("Treasury Payment Processing (Scheduling/Release)"), violating the "do not merge" rule. Ground truth treats release as a single activity ("Release Funds") without merging or parenthetical additions.
  - Adds explanatory parentheses and descriptive phrasing, which renames/embellishes beyond the narrative's described activities.
  - Includes unauthorized notes section, not present in ground truth, introducing extra content.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deductions per Mismatch)**:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst (I vs. C), Compliance Officer (I vs. –). Two mismatches.
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. –). One mismatch.
  - **AML Screening**: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. –). One mismatch.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. C), Compliance Analyst (R, A vs. R), Compliance Officer (C vs. A). Three mismatches—major error in accountability split.
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Treasury Ops (C vs. –). One mismatch.
  - **Last Activity ("Release Funds" equivalent)**: Compliance Analyst (I vs. C). One mismatch.
  - Total: At least 9 cell-level mismatches, with – (no involvement) incorrectly replaced by I or C in several cases, altering role involvement.

- **Formatting and Style (Minor but Penalized Deduction)**:
  - Lacks bolding on activities and cells as in ground truth.
  - Inconsistent use of – for no involvement (LLM uses no – at all, opting for I/C instead).
  - Notes attempt to justify decisions (e.g., conditional escalation), but this adds interpretation not in ground truth or prompt.

The core matrix structure and vocabulary compliance provide a baseline (preventing a 1.0), but the cumulative errors—especially merging, renaming, and widespread RACI inaccuracies—result in a low score, as even small per-cell differences were to incur significant point loss. A perfect match would require identical activities, assignments, and minimalism.
