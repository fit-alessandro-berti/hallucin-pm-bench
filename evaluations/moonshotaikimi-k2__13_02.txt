2. Provides the correct event percentage (2.08%) and unique case percentage (8.33%) with two decimal places.
3. The explanation clearly acknowledges the single-instance problem, discusses risks of unreliable estimates (sampling error, unrepresentative metrics), and cautions against generalising—meeting all required explanation elements.
