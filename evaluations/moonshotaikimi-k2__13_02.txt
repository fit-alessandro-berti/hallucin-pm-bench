The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match the deterministic calculations and rounding (2.08% for events; 8.33% for cases). Question 3 (45 words) adheres to â‰¤100-word limit, explicitly addresses single occurrence ("only one manual check"), notes instability/variance ("extreme sampling error"; "unreliable"), and cautions against generalization ("cannot be assumed representative for the full log"), aligning with ground truth criteria without invention or deviation from the log. No errors or omissions.
