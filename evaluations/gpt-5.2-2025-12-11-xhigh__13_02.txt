**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete:

- Q1: Exact match (1 occurrence, correctly identifies C05).
- Q2a/b: Exact calculations and rounding (2.08%, 8.33%), with correct denominators.
- Q3: ≤100 words (92 words); meets all criteria—(i) explicitly states single occurrence (1/48 events, 1/12 cases), (ii) details instability (outlier skewing averages/rankings, overfitting/ignoring sparse feature, unstable estimates), (iii) cautions over-generalisation (poor generalisation from small slice, unreliable inference). Substance aligns precisely with ground truth sample (e.g., single-observation vulnerability, skewing, model issues), using domain-appropriate process-mining/predictive terms without invention. No errors or deviations.
