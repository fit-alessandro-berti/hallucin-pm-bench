**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Core identification (3 worst activities, jointly on SLA breaches + high waiting):** Correctly selects same three (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment). Minor order difference (Risk first vs. GT's Legal first); no point loss here (+2.0 base).
- **Quantification of SLA exceeds:** Critical failures. Legal Approval: LLM claims "exceeds by 600s" (wrong; GT/table: 900-600=**300s**; -1.5). Risk Review: correct "300s" (+0.5). Credit Assessment: "SLA breach: 60s ... exceeds by 240s" (incoherent math; GT/table: 300-240=**60s** total exceed, not 240s; -1.5). Phrasing inconsistent ("SLA breach: Xs" ambiguous). Total: -2.5 deduction.
- **Recommendations:** Provides one concrete action per activity, but not "data-driven" per table (invents "tiered system," "automate routine," "AI pre-screening"; GT also invents but ties to specifics like "€25k"). Not in "**bullet points only**" (integrated into numbered list vs. GT's standalone **Recommended actions** •••; violates instruction; -1.0).
- **Format/Structure:** No formal header (*To:/From:/Subject:* like GT; -0.5). Numbered list instead of paragraph + bullets (-0.5). Closing sentence ("target bottlenecks...") invented, not grounded (-0.3). ~110 words vs. ≈150 (-0.2).
- **Fidelity to prompt/data:** Grounds in table data (no absent metrics/activities), but math errors undermine. No inventions beyond recs. Strict penalty for small errors amplified: total deductions yield **3.2**.
