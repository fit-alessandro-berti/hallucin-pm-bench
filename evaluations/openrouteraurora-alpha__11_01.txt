The LLM answer fully meets all core requirements: correctly ranks the top 3 activities strictly by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120.0 h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44.0 h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4 h), quotes numbers verbatim from the table, provides one concrete action per activity logically tied to waiting-time issues with explicit ≥20% reduction promises (including calculated approximations demonstrating ≥20% cuts: 36.5→≈29 h, 12.2→≈9.8 h, 7.8→≈6.2 h), excludes all forbidden content (no service times, throughput, or other activities), and stays well under 150 words (~110).

It excels as a professional executive memo with appropriate headers and concise closing. Actions are data-driven via projections and conceptually align closely with ground truth (e.g., reminders/automation for docs/letters, triage for assessment), differing only in wording/details—no invention of unsupported data.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total): stylistic phrasing variations (e.g., "Avg WT =" vs "avg"; full sentences vs "Action:" labels); extra closing sentence (unneeded but harmless). No significant errors.
