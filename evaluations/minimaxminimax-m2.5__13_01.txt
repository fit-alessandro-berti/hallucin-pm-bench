**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data:
- Q1: Exact ("1").
- Q2: Exact match ("5.56 %") with correct calculation shown.
- Q3: Exact ("A1002"), fully accurate and concise.
- Q4: Provides exactly two ideal reasons ("small sample size" and "temporal bias"), phrased clearly and directly derived from the log (18 events/4 cases on one day), with no hallucinations or extras. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., bolding, phrasing) do not affect factual precision.
