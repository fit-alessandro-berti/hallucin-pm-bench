The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise justification by citing the key counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with accurate sequence descriptions, while noting that C001 and C003 comply (acknowledging the "always" requirement fails). This aligns closely with the ground truth's core content and logic. Minor deduction for not using a table format or explicitly tabulating all cases (as in the ground truth), which adds exhaustive visual clarity, though the LLM's concise style still fully addresses the prompt's requirements without errors.
