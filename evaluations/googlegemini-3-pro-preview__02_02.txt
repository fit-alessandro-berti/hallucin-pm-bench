9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1**: The core answer "3" matches the ground truth exactly. However, the added parenthetical explanation ("*(They are C001, C002, and C003)*") introduces extra content not present in the ground truth, which is a minor deviation in brevity and structure. This warrants a small deduction for unnecessary elaboration, treated as a slight formatting/content bloat under strict rules. (Score impact: -0.5)
- **Q2**: The sequence matches the ground truth precisely in content, order, and separators ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"). The ground truth's backslashes (e.g., Receive\_Order) appear to be Markdown escapes and do not alter the factual content; the LLM's rendering is equivalent. No errors. (Full match)
- **Q3**: The listed activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") match exactly in content, distinctiveness, and alphabetical order. The prompt specifies "one per line," which the LLM follows without additional bullets or <br> tags present in the ground truth's presentation. This is a minor formatting difference but aligns with the instruction; no factual deviation. (Full match)

Overall, the response is factually accurate with no hallucinations, missing elements, or errors in logic/content. Deductions are solely for minor extras and structural differences from the ground truth's concise format, reflecting strict evaluation of even small variances. Total: 9.0/10.0.
