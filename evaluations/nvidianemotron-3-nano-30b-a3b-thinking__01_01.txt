**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Failure, ~60% weight)**: Ground truth identifies exactly **3 precise decision points** with **branching logic/outcomes** (eligibility check, amount threshold, final approval). LLM incorrectly inflates to **6 "decision-points"**, treating **non-decision activities** (e.g., Customer_Submit_Claim as "submit claim"; Process_Refund_Payment as "release payment"; Issue_Confirmation_Letter as "send confirmation") as decisions. Misses explicit **branching outcomes** (e.g., reject/return, process ends without payment). High-value branch noted but misframed as separate "point 4" instead of "after pre-approve." Significant invention of "decisions" violates "do not introduce activities" spirit. (-4.0 points)
- **Required Documents (Strong Match, ~30% weight)**: LLM correctly lists **all 7 documents** (same as GT), attributes them accurately to steps (e.g., AuditTrail to auditor, BankTransferAuthorization to payment), notes high-value condition. No extras introduced. (+2.5 points)
- **Structure/Fidelity/Extras (Minor Deductions, ~10% weight)**: Verbose additions (e.g., "must retain evidence," "attach to review file," invented "Decision made" phrases) stray from process description. Table useful but propagates errors. Claims "only" points/docs but undermines with inaccuracies. No legacy activity added (good). (-0.3 points)
- **Overall Strictness**: Core task distorted by ~2x wrong decision points + missing logic; small phrasing drifts compound. Partial credit for docs/branch awareness prevents 1.0.
