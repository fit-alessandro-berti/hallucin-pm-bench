8.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Count)**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence, correctly identified in CaseID 1002). Full points here.
- **Part 2 (Explanation)**: Stays under 120 words (~95). Covers key ideas like small sample size (3 cases), single instance implying rarity, sampling bias, and naming variations (e.g., automatic fraud checks). However, it lacks the ground truth's statistical depth (e.g., frequency swings from 0%â€“7%, wide confidence intervals, extreme sampling error for rare events) and introduces a minor inaccuracy by grouping "Manual Review" as a "subtle naming difference" for fraud checks (it's a separate activity, not a synonym). This reduces precision and insight, warranting a deduction despite overall relevance. Strictness applied: -2.0 for shallower analysis and small error.
