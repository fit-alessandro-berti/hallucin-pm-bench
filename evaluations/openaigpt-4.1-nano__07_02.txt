4.5

• Added tasks  
- The LLM correctly lists "Verify Identity" and "Request Additional Documents" and "Final Reject" as added tasks (matches ground truth).
- Incorrectly includes "Auto-Approve Loan" as a new task (this is a cosmetic renaming of "Approve Loan" in v1 to "Auto-Approve Loan" in v2 and should be ignored; per instructions, cosmetic renamings should not be listed as added tasks).

• Removed tasks  
- Correctly lists "Reject Loan" as removed.
- Incorrectly lists "Approve Loan" as removed (due to the above naming confusion).
- Incorrectly suggests "Review Application" could be removed, then notes it's present in both, which is confusing and unnecessary for a summary.

• Gateway-type changes  
- Correctly identifies the exclusive → inclusive gateway change, though the description is a bit less precise than the ground truth.

**Major errors**:  
- Listing "Approve Loan"/"Auto-Approve Loan" as both removed/added violates the instruction to ignore cosmetic renamings.
- The ground truth expects only one removed and three added tasks, not the four/four as suggested by the LLM answer.
- Some confusion/noise is present in the removed tasks section.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is partially correct but includes significant mistakes and extra/incorrect information, particularly by violating the instruction about ignoring renamings. These errors result in a substantial loss of points.
