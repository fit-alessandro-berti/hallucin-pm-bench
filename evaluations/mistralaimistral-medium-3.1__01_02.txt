### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, correctly identifying the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with precise terminology and flow from the prompt. It uses exact activity names without introducing standard loan terms. The required documents list is complete and matches all six items verbatim from the system prompt, including details like "≤ 3 months old" and "single pay-stub or tax slip."

**Minor deductions (strict assessment):**  
- Slight phrasing variations in decision points (e.g., "> 2 points" vs. ground truth's "≤ 2"; "escalate to" vs. "send to"; added explicit "proceed to NFC" and "if approved, proceed to Disburse Funds," which are implied but not in the ground truth's concise summaries). These are small expansions but deviate from the ground truth's exact wording and structure (e.g., no mention of process branches like "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").  
- Document list adds unprompted explanatory parentheticals (e.g., "(from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B)" and "(minimum 3 local references)"), which are accurate from the process but not in the ground truth's minimal list; omits the ground truth's closing note on exclusions (though not strictly required).  
- Formatting differences (e.g., LLM's ### headers and ▪ bullets vs. ground truth's #### subheaders and numbered list) are cosmetic but contribute to non-exact matching.

No major errors, omissions, or inaccuracies, making this excellent overall but not perfect under utmost strictness.
