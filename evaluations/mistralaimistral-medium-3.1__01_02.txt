8.0

**Reasoning:**

The LLM answer largely matches the ground truth, with mostly minor deviations, but a couple of small, important slips:

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM accurately identifies the three key decision points in the process:
  1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate:** Clearly states the decision rules, escalation to the Harmonisation Committee, and what happens at ≤2 difference.
  2. **Amount Threshold Decision:** States the cutoff and subsequent actions.
  3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval:** Correctly describes the board's "approve or reject" action.
- **Minor issue:** The LLM makes one small deviation: it organizes as bullet points with some added wording ("escalate to..." etc.,) versus the ground truth's slightly more terse style. However, this does not impact factual accuracy. Also, the LLM's placement of the steps in the summary suggests the correct chronological flow.
- **Small terminology drift:** It repeatedly says "escalate to..." where the process simply says "proceed to..." for system auto-approve and "send to..." for board approval. This is a negligible infelicity, but per strictness, deducts a little.

**Required Documents:**
- The LLM correctly lists all six required documents by their correct names as per the process. 
- **Minor deviations:**
  - Adds explanatory parentheticals: listing “from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B” for the Score-Sheet, and “(minimum 3 local references)” after Neighbourhood Feedback Form, which is helpful, but not strictly called for.
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) (template)" is slightly wordier than the ground truth "Community Impact Statement (CIS)" but not incorrect.
- It does *not* introduce any extraneous or standard loan terminology, in line with instructions.
- The LLM omits the informative parenthetical in the ground truth about what is *not required* ("No credit bureau report..."), but this was not required in the user prompt.

**Conclusion:**  
All required decision points are present and correctly named. All documents are enumerated with their proper names. Minor presentational and phrasing extras, and a tiny amount of drift, prevent a perfect score under strict marking. No major factual errors. The result is an accurate, process-faithful summary.

**Thus: 8.0** for high accuracy, penalizing small lapses in phrasing and unnecessary explanatory additions.
