### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high marks for core requirements)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability), quotes exact average and 95th-percentile waiting times from the table, and stays within 150 words (149 claimed, verifiable). No discussion of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities. Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for delays in requests), and at least one explicitly promises ≥20% reduction; others imply significant cuts without fabricating metrics.
  
- **Weaknesses (deductions for differences from ground truth)**: Significant structural and content variances lower the score under strict criteria. The ground truth is a bare-bones, list-style memo focused solely on the three items and actions; the LLM adds an introductory sentence ("causing significant delays"), next steps ("pilot testing in Q2"), sign-off, and word-count note—unwarranted fluff expanding beyond the crisp format. Actions differ entirely (e.g., ground truth emphasizes reminders/e-signatures/rules-engine with specific pilot/estimated reductions like ≥25%; LLM uses portal automation/email/outsource with vaguer backing, including an odd, unsupported "A/B tested without claims of fraud" phrase that seems erroneous or hallucinated, reducing data-driven credibility). No verbatim matching in phrasing or action details, leading to moderate point loss for non-adherence despite factual accuracy. Small errors (e.g., inconsistent abbreviation "95p" vs. ground truth's "p95"; implied rather than explicit ≥20% for all actions) compound deductions.
