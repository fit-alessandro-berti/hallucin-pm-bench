2.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Correctness of Final Answer (Yes/No)**: The LLM correctly answers "No," aligning with the ground truth that the FACT is inaccurate. This earns partial credit (+1.0 baseline).
- **Justification Accuracy and Completeness**: Severe flaws here, leading to major deductions (-7.5 total). 
  - **Misinterpretation of Sequences**: For C001 and C003, the LLM incorrectly claims "only one event between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment" and treats time gaps (e.g., 3-4 minutes) as equivalent to intervening activities. The FACT specifies "no other activities in between," not zero time lag—sequences are direct (no intervening events), so this is a factual error on core cases (+1/-2 each, net -3.0).
  - **Incomplete Case Analysis**: Ignores C002 (Pack_Items intervenes) and C004 (Check_Fraud intervenes), the key counterexamples proving "always" false. Ground truth requires case-by-case verification; omission is a critical gap (-2.0).
  - **Irrelevant/Extraneous Content**: References the "potentially incorrect" label as evidence ("indicating inconsistency"), but the task mandates relying **only** on the log snippet—disregards instructions (-1.0). Vague phrasing like "technically valid, but not 'immediately'" confuses temporal vs. sequential "immediacy" (-1.0). No structured citation of all relevant sequences as required.
  - **Overall Fidelity to Ground Truth**: Ground truth uses a clear table for all cases, precise notes, and logical "always" violation summary. LLM's response is rambling, error-prone, and concludes correctly only by coincidence, not evidence-based reasoning. Strictness demands near-perfect match; small errors (e.g., time conflation) alone warrant significant loss, amplified by wholesale inaccuracies.
- **Clarity and Adherence to Task**: Justification cites some CaseIDs but in a misleading way; lacks the required "citing relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences" precision. Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 2.5 for cumulative failures.
