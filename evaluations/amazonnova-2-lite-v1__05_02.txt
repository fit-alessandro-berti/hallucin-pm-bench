**3.0**

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Correct identification of issue (partial credit)**: Both target the same task (`Task_CollectEquipment`) and attribute (`camunda:dueDate`), correctly shortening `P5D` without adding/deleting elements (+3.0 base).
- **Major error in diff content**: Changed to `"P4D"` instead of ground truth `"P2D"` – core proposal differs significantly, invalidating the specific fix (-4.0).
- **Diff format superiority but irrelevant**: LLM provides proper unified diff hunk with line numbers/context; ground truth malformed (two `@@`, no headers/counts) – no extra credit as must match ground truth (-0).
- **Rationale differences**: Mentions "upstream deadlines" and generic "SLA" vs. ground truth's precise "3-day SLA" and "overall onboarding cycle"; does not match exactly, assumes insufficient reduction closes gap (-2.0, but capped).
- **Strictness applied**: Per instructions, value mismatch is not "small" (50% off reduction: 1D vs. 3D) – significant deduction; output structure close but headers differ slightly (-1.0 total format).
- **Net**: Partial match on intent/task, but fails on precision/ground truth fidelity.
