The LLM answer matches the ground truth almost perfectly across all questions, with no hallucinations, inferences beyond the log, or factual errors. Question 1 is identical in content. Question 2 is identical, including the calculation. Question 3 correctly lists the sole case without extraneous additions, aligning with the ground truth's intent despite minor phrasing differences ("Only case **A1002**" vs. "**A1002**"). Question 4 provides two clear, accurate sampling-related reasons that directly correspond to two of the ground truth's specified options (temporal bias and small sample size), with explanations that are equivalent in substance and fidelity to the log data—no deductions for slight variations in wording or lack of the exact ±5.56 pp example, as the ground truth allows "any two... stated clearly."
