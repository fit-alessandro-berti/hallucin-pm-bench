10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth with full fidelity and precision:

1. It states "1" occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check" â€” correct.
2. It computes the percentage as 5.56%, showing the calculation explicitly (matches ground truth).
3. It lists the correct case ID "A1002" and only that.
4. It provides two clear, sampling-based reasons (temporal bias, small sample size), both of which match acceptable ground truth options, with no extraneous or inferred information.

No deviation, error, or missing information.
