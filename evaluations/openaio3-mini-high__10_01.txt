4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (strong match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This fully aligns with the ground truth and prompt policy.
- **Core RACI Assignments (partial match, +2.0 points)**: The main *Responsible* (R) role per activity matches the ground truth narrative (e.g., AM for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Notify Customer; CO for KYC Review; FC for Payment Clearance; IT for Record Update). Each row has exactly one R, as required. However, *Accountable* (A) is frequently incorrect: LLM assigns A to the R performer (e.g., CO A for KYC Review instead of AM A; FC A for Payment Clearance instead of AM A; IT A for Record Update with no clear A in GT but not to IT alone). This shows a misunderstanding of AM's overarching accountability, leading to -1.0 point deduction per mismatched row (3 rows affected, -3.0 total, but capped in scoring).
- **Secondary Roles and Completeness (major mismatch, -3.0 points)**: LLM omits all *Consulted* (C) assignments (e.g., no CO C, FC I, IT I for Receive Application; no FC C for KYC Review; no AM C or FC C for Record Update) and most *Informed* (I) assignments (e.g., only partial I for AM in KYC Review and Payment Clearance, missing widespread I/C across roles as in ground truth). Blanks imply no involvement, contradicting the ground truth's detailed, full-table coverage where every role has an entry per row. This is a critical error in RACI completeness, resulting in sparse and inaccurate representation (-1.5 per row for omissions, aggregated).
- **Format and Presentation (minor mismatch, -1.0 point)**: The table structure is similar (rows for activities, columns for roles), but LLM uses blanks instead of explicit C/I entries, altering meaning. Extra legend and explanatory text are unwarranted (notes specify no extra content beyond the matrix), though not severely so. Ground truth uses bolding for emphasis (e.g., **R**), which LLM lacks.
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the answer captures the basics (terms and primary R) but fails on nuanced RACI details (A placement, C/I completeness), which are central to a proper matrix. Total differences across ~70% of cell assignments justify a low-mid score; no criminal/jailbreak issues apply.

This evaluation prioritizes ground truth fidelity over general quality.
