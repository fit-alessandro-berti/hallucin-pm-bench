6.0

The LLM answer mostly uses the mandated vocabulary—"KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance"—with the correct spelling and capitalization, and does not mention the forbidden terms. It does not introduce unwarranted tasks, roles, or columns. However, there are notable errors in the RACI allocations:

**Major issues:**

- The LLM answer consistently assigns both "A, R" (Accountable, Responsible) to the same role for most rows, whereas the ground truth generally splits "R" and "A" between them or uses "R / A" to highlight dual responsibility/accountability, giving more nuance.
- The LLM omits critical "C" (Consulted) role designations that appear in the ground truth answer (e.g., Compliance Officer as "C" in multiple steps, Finance Clerk and IT Support as "C" in Record Update, etc.).
- It inconsistently applies "I" (Informed); e.g., Account Manager is not marked as “I” for other roles in the Finance Clerk–driven steps, nor are the “I” assignments for Notify Customer comprehensive as in the ground truth.
- The “Record Update” step only gives A, R to IT Support, omitting the “C” and “I” designations present in the ground truth.

**Minor issues:**

- The legend for the RACI matrix omits "C" (Consulted), so the possible role is not acknowledged or displayed.
- Notes about the process don’t strictly repeat the mandated vocabulary or focus strictly on matching the ground truth; however, they don't violate instructions.

**Summary:**  
All in all, the LLM correctly applies the terminology policy, does not invent extra content, and reasonably captures the major workflow steps. However, because most RACI assignments do not accurately match the ground truth (missing Consulted and Informed roles and generally being less granular about responsibility/accountability), this warrants a significant deduction per grading instructions. Minor loss of points for omitting full "I" assignments and the "C" legend.

**Final: A strict but fair 6.0/10.**
