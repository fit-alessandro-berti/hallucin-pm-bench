The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth answer in both content and formatting. All sets of concurrently-executing tasks from Process B are correctly listed, their membership is correct, and their order is preserved. No extraneous or omitted items. No mention of sequential tasks. The answer is faithful to the requirements and presentation instructions of the prompt and ground truth.
