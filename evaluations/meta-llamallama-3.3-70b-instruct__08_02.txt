The LLM answer is entirely incorrect for both questions. 

- For **Q1**, it answers "No" when the correct answer is "Yes", as shown in the ground truth by the explicit firing sequence allowing T5 to fire before T3.
- For **Q2**, its justification is also invalid: it asserts that P5 can only be created after P4 is produced by T3, but in fact, P4 can be reached without T3 firing (via T1 → T2 → T7).

No partial credit is possible; the logic is fundamentally at odds with the structure of the Petri net and contradicts the ground truth. Both factual accuracy and process understanding are lacking.
