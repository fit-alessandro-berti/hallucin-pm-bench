10.0

The LLM answer exactly mirrors the ground truth answer in both content and format:

- Only tasks from Process B are included.
- All parallel blocks are correctly enumerated, task names are accurate, and the order matches.
- Tasks are comma-separated as requested.
- No extraneous information or tasks from other processes are present.
- The numbering and formatting follow instructions precisely.

There are no errors or omissions, so the answer deserves a 10.0.
