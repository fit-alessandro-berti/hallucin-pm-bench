8.2

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three worst activities by average waiting time are correctly identified and ranked (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability). Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5 h and 120.0 h for #1). No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities mentioned. (Full points here.)
  
- **Format and Constraints**: Crisp memo style with subject line and structured list, under 150 words (~110 words). Adheres to "executive memo" tone without unwarranted content. However, it uses a more narrative/paragraph format with bullets, differing from the ground truth's concise numbered list—minor stylistic deviation but still compliant. (High marks, slight deduction for not mirroring exact brevity.)

- **Recommendations**: Each is concrete and logically tied to reducing waiting times (e.g., automation for documents addresses manual delays). All promise ≥20% cut, as required. However, they lack the ground truth's explicit "data-driven" elements (e.g., no mentions of pilots, estimates like "≥25%", or "targeting 20-25%"; instead, generic "aims to"). Actions are relevant but less specific (e.g., LLM's broad "automated workflow" vs. ground truth's "customer reminders with 24 h escalation"). This introduces differences in depth and evidence simulation, warranting a strict deduction for not fully aligning with "data-driven" phrasing. (Strong but not identical—significant point loss for specificity gap.)

Overall, the response is highly effective and rule-compliant but diverges in action detail and evidential style from the ground truth, reducing the score under strict criteria.
