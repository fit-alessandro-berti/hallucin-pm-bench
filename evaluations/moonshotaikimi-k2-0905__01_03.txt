### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- The ground truth identifies exactly **two** decision points: (1) the conditional risk/amount branch that skips Manual-Underwriting-Review, and (2) the TriVote gate requiring at least two approvals.
- The LLM correctly identifies the risk/amount branch (item 2) and TriVote gate (item 3), with rules that closely match (minor phrasing differences, e.g., "any two" vs. "at least two," and omission of "record 'Approve'").
- However, the LLM incorrectly adds a **third** decision point (item 1), treating the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a "gate" that produces the risk rating. Per the process, this is an assessment step (not a conditional branch or gate), and the actual decision occurs afterward. This is a significant error, as it fabricates a decision point and inflates the count beyond the ground truth.
- Strict penalty for the extra, inaccurate item: partial credit for the two correct ones, but overall deduction for misalignment.

#### Part (b): Documents
- The ground truth lists **nine** documents in precise first-appearance order: Form 14B (step 1), the three scorecards (step 3 inputs), Deck Memo (step 5), Offer Sheet 77 (step 7), Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8), ID Matrix Declaration (step 8), Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9).
- The LLM lists only **six** documents (Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025), in a mostly correct relative order among those included.
- Major omissions: The three scorecards (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow) are explicitly listed as "inputs" (i.e., required documents) in step 3, appearing before Deck Memo. Their complete absence is a critical error, as the prompt requires **all** documents "anywhere in the process."
- Additional issues: Unnecessary parenthetical note on Deck Memo's conditionality (not requested; the list should simply reflect first appearance regardless of branches). Minor formatting (arrow chain vs. numbered list) and abbreviation ("€250 k") are small but penalized under strictness.
- The LLM avoids hallucinations (no KYC/AML mentions), but omissions dominate: roughly 67% coverage, with order disrupted by missing early items.

#### Overall Assessment
- Strengths: Core rules for actual decision points are accurate; no invented processes; document list partially correct without extras.
- Weaknesses: Extra/misclassified decision point; omission of three key documents (scorecards as integral process inputs); extraneous details. These are not minor—the scorecards are foundational to the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, and the decision point inflation misrepresents the process structure.
- With utmost strictness, this warrants a low-mid score: functional but substantially incomplete and inaccurate relative to ground truth.
