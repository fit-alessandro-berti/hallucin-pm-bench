### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is largely accurate in identifying the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing all required documents without introducing extraneous terminology. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth warrant point deductions:

#### Decision Points (扣2.5 points total from perfect 10):
- **Structure and phrasing**: LLM uses plain bullets without the ground truth's numbered list, descriptive branches (e.g., "- branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"), or positioning context (e.g., "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). This makes it less precise and summary-like (0.8 deduction).
- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: LLM refers to "the two scores" without naming "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B," and includes unnecessary step numbers ("continue to step 6") instead of the ground truth's general "continue" (0.8 deduction). Arrow notation (⇒) is absent, reducing clarity.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: LLM uses "proceed to step 8" with a step number, violating the "exact activity names" by not saying "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" (0.6 deduction). Misses explicit positioning "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check."
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: Minor capitalization inconsistency ("approve or reject" vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**") and less emphatic phrasing (0.3 deduction).

#### Required Documents (扣0.3 points total):
- Matches the complete list exactly, using prompt terminology without additions.
- Minor wording variances: "≤ 3 months old" (LLM) vs. "≤ 3 months" (GT, 0.1 deduction); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (LLM, faithful to prompt) vs. abbreviated "pay-stub/tax slip" (GT, 0.1); "(CIS) template" (LLM) vs. "(CIS)" (GT, 0.1). No extra note like GT's disclaimer, but this is not required.
- Structure: Bullets vs. numbered list is a trivial format difference but counts as minor deviation (included in above).

Overall, the answer is comprehensive (covers all elements) but introduces subtle inaccuracies in precision, context, and fidelity to the ground truth's concise, activity-focused summary style, justifying a score below 8.0 despite strong coverage.
