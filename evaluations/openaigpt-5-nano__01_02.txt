8.0

The LLM answer is largely accurate, but not perfect:

**Positives:**
- Lists all required documents correctly, matching the ground truth.
- Uses the precise document names and process step names (does not introduce outside terminology).
- Lists the main decision points with the correct names and criteria.
- Correct logic at each decision point.

**Minor Errors:**
- The answer formats the decision points as bullet list items instead of numbering and titling them, making tracking/ordering less clear.
- The decision point for "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" does not explicitly specify that this stage only occurs if the amount is ≥ €15 000; while implied by the order, this could be made more precise (as in the ground truth).
- The "Required documents" list omits the clarifying note “No credit bureau report, collateral forms…” found in the ground truth (which would help reinforce compliance with special process requirements).
- “Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)”—less concise/standardised than ground truth “pay-stub/tax slip”.

**Strict grading:**
- Absence of contextual notes costs ~0.5-1 point.
- Slight lack of clarity in restating conditional flows and requirements, another ~0.5-1 point.

**Conclusion:** Strong response, but the lack of minor clarifications and contextual notes per the ground truth and the blurring of order/conditionality between decision points merit a deduction, resulting in an 8.0.
