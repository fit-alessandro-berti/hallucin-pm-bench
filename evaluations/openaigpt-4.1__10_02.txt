3.0

The LLM answer demonstrates an understanding of RACI tables, but it contains critical errors and notable deviations from the ground truth, meriting a very strict deduction:

**Major issues:**
- **Incorrect Roles and Activities:** The answer introduces "KYC Review" as a role (column), which is NOT part of the mandated vocabulary for rolesâ€”it is only to be used as an activity. The ground truth uses "KYC Review" only as an activity.
- **Omission of "Operations Manager":** The LLM answer omits "Operations Manager" as a role, which appears in the ground truth. This leads to incomplete accountability assignments.
- **Task Granularity & Wording:** The LLM divided some steps into more granular actions (e.g., splitting notification and archiving), but this isn't aligned with the ground truth mapping of activities/tasks. The tasks don't match the exact mandated wording.
- **Incorrect Role-Task Assignments:** Several RACI assignments do not line up with the mandated assignments from the ground truth (for example, "Approve flagged high-risk transaction" is assigned "Accountable" to "Regulatory Liaison", but in the ground truth, "Regulatory Liaison" is "Responsible" and "Operations Manager" is "Accountable", which is a significant process governance error).
- **Inconsistent use of Mandated Vocabulary:** "KYC Review" appears both as an activity and as a role/column, which is explicitly not in the ground truth and contrary to instruction.

**Minor issues:**
- **Task Numbering:** The LLM answer numbers tasks, which isn't wrong but is not present in the ground truth.
- **Additional Steps:** It creates extra lines for notifying Regulatory Liaison of the archive, which isn't strictly necessary or found in the ground truth.

**Positive aspects:**
- The answer is clearly formatted as a Markdown table.
- It tries to use the mandated vocabulary for activities and roles.
- It attempts to map each step from the informal description.

**Summary:**  
Due to the incorrect and incomplete role mapping, misuse of the mandated vocabulary, and RACI assignment deviations, a *strict* assessment warrants a 3.0. The answer is seriously flawed but not total non-compliance (which would score even lower).
