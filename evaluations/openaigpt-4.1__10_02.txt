The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Roles/Columns**: Introduces "KYC Review" as a role (misinterpreting the mandate, which specifies it only for activities), omits "Operations Manager", and mismatches the exact column structure.
- **Tasks**: Expands to 8 rows with splits (e.g., separate "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison"), adds non-source elements (task 8), and uses verbose phrasing not matching ground truth's concise, mandated task names (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. "Receive customerâ€™s transfer instruction and log it in the system"). Fails to align exactly with the 6 core activities, including incomplete coverage of notifications and SWIFT without ground truth's consolidation.
- **RACI Assignments**: Almost no overlap; e.g., "Receive" is solely "Responsible" for Transaction Analyst in LLM vs. **R** TA / I Regulatory / **A** Operations Manager / C IT in ground truth. Similar mismatches across all rows (e.g., "KYC Review" assigned to invalid "KYC Review" role vs. C TA / **R** Regulatory / **A** Operations Manager / I IT).
- **Formatting and Extras**: Uses full words instead of bold abbreviations (**R**, etc.), adds unsolicited notes explaining decisions (not in ground truth), lacks the exact legend, and includes a note on mandated wording that contradicts the table's errors.
- **Mandate Adherence (relative to ground truth)**: While both attempt mandated terms, LLM's use of "KYC Review" as a role violates the intent, and overall structure ignores ground truth's precise mapping without omissions/substitutions.

These are not minor errors but fundamental failures to replicate the ground truth's structure, content, and assignments, resulting in zero fidelity.
