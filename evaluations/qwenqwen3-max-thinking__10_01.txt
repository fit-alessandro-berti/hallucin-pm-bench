2.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit: +2.0)**: Correctly uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** with exact spelling/capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence"). Matches ground truth here.
- **Structure & Formatting (Low: +0.5)**: Table format similar (rows/columns correct, no extras). However:
  - Headers include abbreviations "(AM)" etc.; ground truth uses full names only.
  - No bolding on **KYC Review** etc. or **R** cells as in ground truth.
  - Extra unwarranted content: Title, RACI key, and explanatory note (violates "no unwarranted content" implicitly; ground truth is clean table-only).
- **RACI Content (Fail: -7.5 total deduction)**: Major deviations, not "utmost strictness" match.
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | All rows | Only "R" assigned (one per row, correct per narrative); blanks everywhere. Ground truth has full RACI: **R/A**, **A**, **C**, **I** distributed. No single match per cell. |
  | Receive Application | AM: R vs **R/A**; others blank vs C/I/I. |
  | KYC Review | CO: R (correct) vs **R**; AM blank vs A; others blank vs C/I. |
  | Order Vetting | AM: R vs **R/A**; others blank. |
  | Payment Clearance | FC: R vs **R**; others blank vs A/C/I. |
  | Record Update | IT: R vs **R**; others blank vs C/I/C. |
  | Notify Customer | AM: R vs **R/A**; others blank vs I/I/I. |
  - Fails "AM is Accountable where appropriate" (no **A** anywhere).
  - Only ~20% cell-level overlap (Rs only).

**Overall**: Vocab saves it from 1.0, but RACI is fundamentally incomplete/wrong vs. ground truth (not just small errors). Strict penalty applied.
