### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, roles, assignments, and completeness, warranting a very low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Roles/Columns**: LLM uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support (correctly incorporating mandated terms where applicable but omitting Operations Manager, a core column in ground truth). This results in incomplete role coverage and incorrect distribution of responsibilities/accountabilities (e.g., no accountability assigned to Operations Manager across all tasks).

- **Number and Mapping of Tasks**: LLM expands to 7 rows, introducing an extraneous row 7 for "notify" (not a distinct task in the source or ground truth) and splitting "archive and notify" unnecessarily. Ground truth maps precisely to 6 tasks from the informal description without additions or splits. LLM's task wordings are verbose and not aligned (e.g., "Receive customer transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; no bolding of mandated "**KYC Review**").

- **RACI Assignments**: Near-total mismatch in every row, with no fidelity to ground truth:
  - Row 1: LLM assigns R/A solely to Transaction Analyst; ground truth distributes R (TA), A (OM), I (RL), C (IT).
  - Row 2: LLM R/A to TA; ground truth R (TA), A (RL), I (OM), C (IT).
  - Row 3: LLM R/A to RL; ground truth C (TA), R (RL), A (OM), I (IT).
  - Row 4: LLM I (TA), R/A (RL); ground truth C (TA), R (RL), A (OM), I (IT). (LLM incorrectly uses I instead of C for TA.)
  - Row 5: LLM R/A to TA (for release); ground truth R (TA), I (RL), A (OM), C (IT). LLM's separate row 6 for SWIFT is unfaithful, as ground truth integrates sending into "Release Payment" without a distinct row.
  - Row 6/7 (LLM): R/A to IT for SWIFT/archive/notify, I to RL; ground truth's single row 6 for "Archive Record" assigns R (IT), A (OM), C (TA), I (RL), with no separate notify or SWIFT row.

- **RACI Completeness**: LLM's legend omits **C (Consulted)** entirely, using only R, A, I—violating the full RACI framework required by the prompt and present in ground truth. No assignments use C, leading to incomplete matrices (e.g., multiple blanks where ground truth has C or I).

- **Formatting and Mandated Compliance**: While LLM uses Markdown and incorporates mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions, it fails ground truth's exact mapping and bolding (e.g., no "**KYC Review**"). The extra legend explanation and numbering (# column) add unrequired elements not in ground truth.

These are not minor; even small mismatches (e.g., missing C, extra row, wording variances) compound to show poor alignment with the source text's steps and ground truth's precise structure. The answer covers the informal description but reinterprets roles and RACI illogically, justifying minimal scoring.
