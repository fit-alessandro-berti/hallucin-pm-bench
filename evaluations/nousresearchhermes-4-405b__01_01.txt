### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer covers the core elements but introduces several deviations from the ground truth, warranting a mid-range score under strict criteria. Key issues include speculative phrasing ("presumably halt," "likely stops"), reordered decision points (high-value listed first, disrupting logical flow from ground truth), incomplete capture of the combined "final payment approval" decision (LLM separates PreApprove but omits explicit Auditor Review decision, unlike ground truth #3), and unnecessary additions like relevance explanations in the documents list (prompt asks only to "list," not explain; ground truth is a simple catalogue). The documents list is complete and accurate but expanded beyond requirements. No new activities/artifacts are introduced, which avoids worse penalties, but small mismatches (e.g., lack of rejection phrasing precision, missing catalogue note) accumulate significant deductions.
