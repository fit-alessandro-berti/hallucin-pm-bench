The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact tasks added (by ID: check_vip and generate_qr), removed (by ID: send_rma_label), and the gateway change (gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway), with no extraneous speculation or other differences reported. However, it loses significant points for strict adherence to the ground truth: (1) uses only task IDs instead of primary task names with IDs in parentheses; (2) omits version specifiers (v1/v2) in the gateway change; (3) employs bullet points (-) under headings instead of asterisks (*); (4) headings use specified â€¢ bullets and colons, differing from ground truth's bold ** formatting without bullets or colons; (5) lacks the closing note on no other differences. These omissions and formatting variances represent incomplete factual representation and structural mismatches, warranting deductions despite factual accuracy on changes.
