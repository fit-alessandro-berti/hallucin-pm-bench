9.0

The LLM answer correctly responds "No" to the factual claim and justifies the decision by specifically citing the relevant CaseIDs (C002 and C004) where there are intervening activities between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment." It explicitly describes the sequences for these cases, clearly indicating the violation of the "always" and "immediate" conditions in the FACT.

Compared to the ground truth answer, there are minor omissions:

- The ground truth provides a structured, case-by-case breakdown—including cases that do conform, not just those that violate—which more fully demonstrates comprehensive examination of the log.
- The ground truth also explicitly mentions that only two cases (C002 and C004) violate the rule, providing exactness in quantifying how strong the violation is.

Small point deduction reflects these omissions in thoroughness and detail, but the LLM answer remains precise, accurate, and well-justified within the provided evidence.

Thus, 9.0 is assigned.
