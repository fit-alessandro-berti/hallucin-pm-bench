6.0

**Justification:**

a) **Decision points**
- The LLM answer incorrectly lists the actual risk assessment (step 3, the "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" itself) as a decision point, but the real decision point is the conditional branch that determines whether Manual-Underwriting-Review is skipped—per ground truth. The LLM also invents a "Manual-Underwriting-Bypass" as if it's distinct from the single branch, which is redundant.
- In step 4 of its answer, the LLM incorrectly introduces an "Applicant-Confirmation Gate" as a decision point, but per the process definition, requesting documents from the applicant isn't a formal gate: the only actual "gates" are the conditional skip after risk assessment and the TriVote approval. The user merely needs to supply paperwork to proceed, which is process compliance, not an explicit conditional gate.
- The TriVote rule is described correctly.

b) **Documents**
- The LLM nearly matches the ground truth, giving all documents in the correct order, including Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, separated), and no hallucinated documents.
- Small notational differences exist (the ground truth uses "Scorecard–Cyan", LLM uses "Scorecard – Cyan") but are not semantically meaningful.
- "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is listed as a document in the LLM's list, which matches the ground truth.

**Summary of deductions:**
- Incorrect identification of decision points: listing non-existent gates and including the risk check step itself instead of the real conditional branch, introducing redundancy. (-2.5)
- Invention of an additional gate (Applicant-Confirmation), which is process compliance, not a decision. (-1.0)
- Slightly inaccurate phrasing and not being as precise as ground truth in describing the logic of the skip branch. (-0.5)

**Positives:**  
- The LLM does not hallucinate any non-existent documents (no KYC/AML/credit bureau mentions).
- Document order and content matches ground truth.

**Overall conclusion:** The documents are correct, but the errors in identifying and describing the process’s true decision points are significant and cumulatively lower the score markedly.
