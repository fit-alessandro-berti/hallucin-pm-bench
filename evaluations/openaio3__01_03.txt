### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- The LLM incorrectly identifies four decision points, while the ground truth specifies only two explicit ones (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate). This is a significant error, as it fabricates additional "gates" or branches not present or described as such in the process.
  - Point 1 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check): This is not a decision point or conditional branch; it's step 3, which generates an input (risk rating) for the actual branch in step 4. Including it as a "decision point" misrepresents the process—major deduction.
  - Point 2 (Manual-Underwriting-Bypass): Mostly accurate, but the phrasing ("Low OR Medium AND ≤ €250 000") is correct in logic yet slightly reworded from the ground truth's "Low or Medium *and* ..."; minor, but under strictness, it contributes to loss.
  - Point 3 (“TriVote” Gate): Close, but adds unstated implications like "otherwise it is rejected," which the process and ground truth do not explicitly state (they focus on the "suffice to pass" rule). The process's contradictory phrasing ("requires all three" vs. "any two suffice") is not clarified, but the LLM's interpretation leans interpretive rather than neutral—moderate error.
  - Point 4 (Applicant-Confirmation Gate): Entirely hallucinated; the process describes step 8 as "Request-Applicant-Confirmation" leading directly to step 9, without any explicit conditional rule, gate, or "halt" description. This invention of a decision point directly contradicts the ground truth's omission—major deduction.
- Overall for (a): The extra points and misclassification inflate the response beyond the process's defined branches, showing poor fidelity. This alone warrants a low score, penalized heavily per instructions.

#### Part (b): Documents
- The list matches the ground truth exactly in content, order, and completeness (9 items, no additions like KYC/AML hallucinations).
- Minor formatting differences (e.g., spaces in "Scorecard – Cyan" vs. ground truth's en-dash "Scorecard–Cyan") are cosmetic but, under utmost strictness, noted as negligible since they don't alter meaning.

#### Overall Assessment
- Strengths: Part (b) is flawless; no prohibited hallucinations.
- Weaknesses: Part (a) has critical inaccuracies in identification and description of decision points, violating the prompt's call for "every decision point (gate or conditional branch)" by adding non-existent ones and mislabeling step 3. This results in substantial divergence from the ground truth, justifying a mid-low score despite a perfect (b). Strict evaluation penalizes the overreach heavily, as even small interpretive additions (e.g., "rejected") compound the issues.
