9.0

- The LLM answer is quite concise and matches the ground truth in all substantive content.  
- Answer 1: "3" instead of "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" omits the explicit case names, which is a small but relevant omission given the ground truth's explicitness.  
- Answer 2 and 3 both correctly replicate the ground truth content, including correct activity names.
- The lack of explicit case names in answer 1 constitutes a significant but not major loss: the information is correct but less informative.  
- Therefore, 9.0 reflects a minor but strict deduction for not listing the case names explicitly.
