- The LLM answer is highly accurate and follows the prompt's instruction for concise bullet-point responses.
- Q1: Correct count (3), but lacks the explicit listing of cases (C123, C456, C789) present in the ground truth, which is a minor omission warranting a small deduction under strict evaluation.
- Q2: Matches exactly (ignoring insignificant escaping in ground truth).
- Q3: Matches exactly.
- Formatting is appropriately concise, with no extraneous content.
