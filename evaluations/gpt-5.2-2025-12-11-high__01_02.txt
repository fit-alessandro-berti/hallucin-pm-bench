**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision Points (major errors, ~50% deduction)**: Ground truth lists **exactly 3 decision points** with precise flow context (e.g., "branch after Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). LLM incorrectly lists **4**, fabricating **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** as #1 (not in GT; KYC is a verification step, not a summarized "decision point"). Omits flow positions. Minor rephrasing (e.g., "proceed to" vs. "send to") adds differences. Verbose additions like "application cannot proceed" are interpretive extras not in GT.
- **Required Documents (minor errors, ~10% deduction)**: Lists all 6 correctly matching prompt, but phrasing/formatting differs (bullets vs. numbered; full "single pay-stub or tax slip" / "(≤ 3 months old)" / "(CIS) template" vs. GT's abbreviations "pay-stub/tax slip" / "(≤ 3 months)" / "(CIS)"). Lacks GT's extra note (though not required by prompt).
- **Overall Structure/Formatting (~20% deduction)**: Headers (## vs. ####), bolding/italics inconsistent, more verbose summaries vs. GT's concise bullets/italics. Introduces unrequested details.
- **Strictness Applied**: Extra decision point is a substantive content error (alters summary accuracy); small phrasing/flow omissions compound to prevent >5.0. Perfect match =10.0; this has clear mismatches.
