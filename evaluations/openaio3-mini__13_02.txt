The LLM answer is accurate and complete. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the ground truth precisely. For question 3, the response (78 words) addresses the single-occurrence issue, notes analytical skew from rarity (implying instability/variance), and cautions against over-generalization, fully aligning with the required criteria. No errors or inventions from the log.
