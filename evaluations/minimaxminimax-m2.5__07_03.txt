The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (3), the removed task (1), and both gateway type changes with exact IDs, names, and type transitions matching the ground truth content. No extra, missing, or incorrect changes. Format closely aligns with the prompt's specified phrasing and example (e.g., "id: old → new" with single space after colon), listing one difference per line under verbatim headings. Deductions for: absence of 6 bullet prefixes ("- "), extra blank lines after headings (stylistic mismatch), trailing spaces after headings, and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway line (GT-specific formatting). These are small presentational differences but warrant loss per strict criteria.
