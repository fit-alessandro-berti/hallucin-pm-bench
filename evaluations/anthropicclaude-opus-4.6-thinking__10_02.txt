**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Roles mismatch (-2.5)**: LLM uses only Transaction Analyst (TA), Regulatory Liaison (RL), IT Support (IT). Ground truth includes an additional "Operations Manager" column with consistent **A** assignments. Missing role = incomplete.
- **Tasks mismatch (-2.5)**: LLM invents 7 tasks, splitting source step 5 into "Release the approved payment" (#5) and "Send SWIFT message" (#6), renaming "Archive the case file" to #7, with descriptive phrasing. Ground truth has exactly 6 tasks, precise phrasing (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "Archive Record"), no split for SWIFT. Extra/inaccurate tasks/names = major deviation.
- **RACI assignments completely divergent (-2.0)**: No row matches across roles/tasks. E.g.:
  | Task (approx.) | LLM | Ground Truth |
  |----------------|-----|--------------|
  | Receive/Log | TA **R/A**, RL I | TA **R**, RL I, Ops **A**, IT C |
  | Screen | TA **R/A**, RL C | TA **R**, RL **A**, Ops I, IT C |
  | KYC Review | TA C, RL **R/A** | TA C, RL **R**, Ops **A**, IT I |
  | Approve High-Risk | RL **R/A**, TA I | TA C, RL **R**, Ops **A**, IT I |
  | Release | TA **R**, RL **A**, IT I | TA **R**, RL I, Ops **A**, IT C |
  | Archive | IT **R/A**, TA/RL I | IT **R**, Ops **A**, TA/RL C/I |
  Every cell differs; LLM overuses R/A on performers, ignores Ops **A** pattern.
- **Structure/extras mismatch (-1.0)**: LLM adds unrequested header, separate Roles table, "Key to Assignments" explanations, **R / A** combined bold, 7 rows. Ground truth: single clean table, "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header, simple **R** bold singles, minimal Legend + notes. Extraneous content violates "organise the RACI matrix clearly" simplicity.
- **Partial credits (+0.5 total)**: Uses mandated vocabulary perfectly ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"); Markdown table; covers source steps (albeit split).

Total differences are fundamental (roles, tasks, assignments, format); no near-matches justify higher score under "utmost strictness".
