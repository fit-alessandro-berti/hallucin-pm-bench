3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Under strict criteria, the LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, roles, task breakdown, RACI assignments, and formatting, warranting a low score. Key differences include:

- **Roles (major error, -3.0 points):** LLM omits "Operations Manager" entirely, using only 3 columns instead of 4. This leads to incorrect accountability assignments (e.g., LLM assigns "A" to Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison where GT assigns to Operations Manager, fundamentally altering RACI logic). Mandated roles are used, but the incomplete set mismatches GT.

- **Tasks (major error, -2.0 points):** LLM expands to 8 tasks, adding a separate "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion" (not in informal text or GT) and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" (GT folds this into "Release Payment" without separation). GT has exactly 6 concise tasks with mandated phrasing (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. LLM's "Receive and log transfer instruction"; "Archive Record" vs. "Archive case file"). LLM's extra/granular breakdown introduces unsubstantiated elements, and wordings like "sanctions lists" (plural) vs. GT's "Sanctions List" (singular, matching informal text) are minor but penalized strictly.

- **RACI Assignments (major error, -1.5 points):** Widespread mismatches due to missing role. Examples:
  - "Receive": LLM (TA: R,A) vs. GT (TA: R; OM: A; RL: I; IT: C) – incorrect A and missing I/C.
  - "Screen": Partial match (TA: R; RL: A), but misses OM: I and IT: C.
  - "KYC Review": LLM (RL: R,A; TA: C) vs. GT (RL: R; OM: A; TA: C; IT: I) – wrong A, misses IT: I.
  - "Approve": Similar misalignment.
  - "Release": LLM (TA: R,A; RL: C) vs. GT (TA: R; OM: A; RL: I; IT: C) – wrong A/C/I.
  - No equivalent for GT's full assignments in "Archive Record" (misses TA: C; OM: A; RL: I).
  These errors cascade, failing to "cover every task" accurately per prompt and GT.

- **Vocabulary and Mandates (minor error, -0.5 points):** Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst" (partial credit). However, task phrasings don't fully align with GT's "mandated wording" emphasis (e.g., no bolding on key activities like "**KYC Review**"; adds "(sender and beneficiary)" and "(if applicable)" not in GT).

- **Format (minor error, -0.5 points):** Markdown table is present, but lacks GT's header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), bolding (e.g., on R/A), and "Legend" footer. No post-table notes on mapping/usage, which GT includes to confirm adherence.

The LLM captures the informal text's essence and mandated terms but fails on completeness, accuracy, and fidelity to GT's structure/assignments. Baseline for partial coverage of mandates/tasks: 4.0, deducted for cumulative errors. No credit for extras like separate notification, as they deviate from source/GT.
