5.0

**Justification and Error Analysis:**

1. **Vocabulary Compliance:**  
   - The LLM answer consistently uses the enforced terms **Transaction Analyst**, **Regulatory Liaison**, and **KYC Review** (correct—no forbidden synonyms are present).
   - However, in the "Tasks" column, several activities are described with language not strictly consistent with the mandated wording or the ground truth (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" instead of "Receive Payment Instruction", "Screen payment against sanctions lists" versus "Screen Against Sanctions List", etc.).

2. **Structural and Content Omissions:**
   - The LLM table omits the "Operations Manager" column, which is present in the ground truth and is necessary for correct accountability assignment (the prompt does not forbid this column).
   - The LLM adds tasks not listed or structured in the ground truth (e.g., "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion" is not present in the ground truth).
   - Task/Activity titles do not match the ground truth’s enforced style and order.

3. **RACI Assignment Errors:**
   - For several tasks, the Responsible/Accountable designations differ from the ground truth (e.g., "Screen payment against sanctions lists": LLM has Transaction Analyst as R and Regulatory Liaison as A, but omits informing Operations Manager and consulting IT Support).
   - The LLM misassigns or omits “Consulted” and “Informed” roles in some tasks (e.g., IT Support should be "C" on "Release Payment", not "R,A" on "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" because the ground truth never separates these as distinct tasks).
   - "Archive case file"/"Archive Record" is handled differently (in the LLM, only IT Support, but in the ground truth, IT Support is Responsible, and Transaction Analyst is Consulted, Regulatory Liaison is Informed, Operations Manager is Accountable).

4. **Formatting Issues:**
   - The LLM's task column is not aligned with the mandated wording of the ground truth, causing mapping errors (no explicit "KYC Review" task labelled as such).

5. **Process Flow Mismatches:**
   - The LLM splits and elaborates steps into more granular tasks than the ground truth, creating misalignment with the source and ground truth structure.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer demonstrates correct use of the enforced vocabulary for roles/activities but deviates from the mandated wording, omits an entire responsible party (Operations Manager), alters task granularity, introduces tasks not included in the ground truth, and misassigns RACI roles. These flaws are substantial and warrant a mid-range score, but *not* a failing mark since some vocabulary and basic structure are correct.

**Hence: 5.0/10.0**
