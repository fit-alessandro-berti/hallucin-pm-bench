### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, ~40% of Score Impact)**: The LLM identifies only 2 decision points, missing the critical third one in the ground truth (final payment approval/rejection at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** / **Senior_Auditor_Review**). This omission ignores implicit rejection paths in the process constraints (e.g., "has succeeded" implies possible failure leading to process end without payment). Additionally, the LLM's summaries are vague and incomplete: it does not explicitly describe branching outcomes (e.g., "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → rejected" for triage, or approval vs. rejection for the final step). The amount threshold is correctly noted but lacks precise placement (after PreApprove) and full outcomes (e.g., skip vs. include review). Naming uses activity labels instead of descriptive summaries (e.g., "Eligibility check"), reducing clarity. These are substantial errors, not minor.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Strengths, ~30% of Score Impact)**: The list is complete and accurate, matching all 7 documents without introducing extras. The note on **AuditTrail** (conditional use) aligns closely with the ground truth. However, the LLM omits the ground truth's explicit caveat that **AuditTrail** is "still part of the catalogue" and the final parenthetical note affirming no other documents/legacy activities—small but required for full fidelity to the prompt's "do not introduce" rule.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Partial Alignment, ~30% of Score Impact)**: The response is well-organized with sections, but it does not use a table for decisions as in the ground truth, making comparisons less precise. No introduction of undefined elements (good), but the incomplete coverage of decisions violates the "every decision point" requirement strictly. Strict scoring penalizes these gaps heavily, preventing a higher mark despite solid document handling.
