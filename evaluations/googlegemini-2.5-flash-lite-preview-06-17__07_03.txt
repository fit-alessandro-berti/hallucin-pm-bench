7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (major deduction)**: The LLM correctly identifies all 3 added tasks and the 1 removed task, matching the ground truth. However, it misses one gateway type change (Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel), which is a verifiable difference present in the XML (v1 uses `<exclusiveGateway>`, v2 uses `<parallelGateway>`). The task requires summarizing *all* functional changes under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, so this omission is a significant error, warranting a substantial deduction (e.g., -2.0 points from a base of 10.0).
- **Format and Style Differences (minor deductions)**: The LLM uses plain line-separated lists without the bullet points (`-`) present in the ground truth for all sections, which introduces unnecessary differences in presentation. The prompt does not explicitly require bullets, but strict comparison to the ground truth penalizes this inconsistency (-0.5 points). Gateway formatting matches the prompt's example (e.g., `id: old → new`), with no issues there.
- **Overall Compliance**: No extraneous commentary, guesses, or mentions of unchanged elements, adhering to the system instructions. Headings are verbatim and in order. Under utmost strictness, the missing change dominates, but partial correctness on other sections prevents a floor score.

Total differences lead to a score of 7.0: strong on most content but incomplete on gateways, with minor formatting variances.
