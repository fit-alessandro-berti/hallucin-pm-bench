6.0

The LLM answer captures three out of the five required differences from the ground truth. Specifically:

**ADDED TASKS**  
- The required dash ("-") before each bullet is missing but the IDs and names are correct.

**REMOVED TASKS**  
- Same issue: missing dash before the bullet.

**GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**  
- Only one of the two gateway changes is present; "Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel" is omitted.

Strictly graded:
- Missing dashes per spec: minor but systematic error (should cost 0.5-1 point).
- Omission of one gateway change: major, demonstrates missing a functional change (should reduce score significantly, by 2-3 points at least).
- Order and format for tasks and gateways not strictly as instructed (again, 0.5-1 point).
  
Given these errors, a score of **6.0** reflects substantial loss for the missing functional difference and further deductions for formatting omissions.
