**7.5**

1️⃣ The LLM’s answer to the frequency is correct: “Manual Fraud Check” appears exactly once in the excerpt. No errors here.

2️⃣ The explanation is directionally accurate: it points out the log is only a snippet and notes the risk of undercounting when extrapolating from that sample. However, relative to the ground truth:

- **Missing precision**: The LLM omits statistical issues like the high proportional variance when there’s only a single occurrence in a small sample (“confidence interval,” “extreme sampling error”), which are critical to understanding why the estimate would be unreliable.
- **Key omission**: The answer fails to mention the confusion possible from near-synonyms or similar activity names (“Automatic Fraud Check,” “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) which—if not strictly string matched—might bias analysts’ estimates. The prompt clearly emphasizes “exact” matches, and this nuance is overlooked.
- **Detail**: The LLM mentions a partial time window, but does not tightly specify that the 14 events are only from three cases in under two hours, a helpful quantitative illustration used in the ground truth.

Altogether, the core idea is present but lacks the specificity and sophistication of the ground truth; notably, it skips crucial caveats about event-name variants and statistical uncertainty when generalizing from small samples. These omissions merit a substantial points reduction but not a failing score.
