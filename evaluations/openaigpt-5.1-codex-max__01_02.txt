**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Decision points (major flaws, ~60% match, heavy deduction)**:
  - Correctly identifies 3/3 core points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with mostly accurate phrasing/conditions.
  - **Critical error**: Incorrectly adds **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** as a 4th decision point ("proceed only after collecting..."), implying branching/gate logic not present in process or ground truth. NFC is a mandatory sequential step (collect references), not a decision point with if/else/escalation. Ground truth correctly lists exactly 3, with precise sequence context ("after Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
  - Minor issues: Lacks exact sequence phrasing; extra parenthetical "(using exact activity names)"; redundant separate MBA entry with "(applies to amounts ≥ €15 000)"; bullet vs. numbered format; "**approve or reject**" vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**" capitalization.
- **Required documents (~95% match, minor deduction)**:
  - Complete list of all 6, matching content exactly.
  - Small errors: Unnecessary bolding (**ML-APP-01**, **CIS**, **NFF** vs. plain parens); extra "template" (prompt-accurate but GT omits); phrasing closer to prompt than GT in spots (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)" vs. GT's shortened "(≤ 3 months)", "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip").
  - Bullet vs. numbered format; lacks GT's extra note (not required but contributes to difference).
- **Overall**: Strong on documents and core facts, but decision points invention + formatting/structure deviations = significant strict penalty (not 10.0 perfect match). No introduction of forbidden terminology.
