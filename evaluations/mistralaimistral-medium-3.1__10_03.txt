### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer adheres strictly to the vocabulary policy by using only the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or alternatives. However, it violates the prompt's instruction to "do not rename, merge, or add activities" by introducing four unauthorized activities (Approval, Payment Scheduling, Funds Release, Notification), while the ground truth interprets the narrative into exactly six activities without excess additions. This alone warrants a significant deduction for structural deviation.

RACI assignments show multiple mismatches against the ground truth, treated as errors under strict evaluation:
- **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst is "I" (LLM) vs. "C" (GT) → incorrect involvement level.
- **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: Front-Office Analyst is "I" (LLM) vs. "–" (GT); Treasury Ops is "–" (LLM) vs. "I" (GT) → four total errors across both activities, ignoring narrative flow (file "moves" without informing Front or Treasury at these stages).
- **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office Analyst is "I" (LLM) vs. "C" (GT); Treasury Ops is "–" (LLM) vs. "I" (GT) → incorrect involvement.
- For the added "Approval" row (analogous to GT's "Compliance Officer Approval"): Front-Office Analyst is "–" (LLM) vs. "I" (GT); Treasury Ops is "I" (LLM) vs. "–" (GT) → reversed roles.
- "Funds Release" mismatches GT's "Release Funds" by omitting "C" for Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer, treating it as isolated rather than consultative.

Format issues include non-bolded "R, A" (vs. GT's **bold** emphasis), header verbosity with "(R/A/C/I)" (unnecessary per prompt's Markdown table requirement), and use of "-" instead of "–". No coverage of GT's "Compliance Officer Approval" as a distinct activity, and extraneous rows dilute focus on "every activity described above." These cumulative errors (excess activities, ~8 RACI mismatches, format inconsistencies) result in a low score, despite vocabulary compliance. A perfect match would require exact replication of GT's structure and assignments.
