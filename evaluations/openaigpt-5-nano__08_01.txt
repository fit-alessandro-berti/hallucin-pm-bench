7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3 and provides a valid firing sequence: T1, T2, T5, which matches the ground truth up to and including T5's firing. The marking updates are accurate for the transitions used, and the logic for why T5 is enabled is stated correctly.

However, several important elements present in the ground truth answer are missing or incomplete:

- The LLM answer **does not continue the firing sequence beyond T5**; it omits the possibility and result of firing T3 and T4, which the ground truth provides for completeness.
- It **does not discuss** the crucial fact that T5 is only ever enabled before T3 fires, and that firing T3 disables T5 permanently. The ground truth provides a formal argument for why T5 can never fire after T3 and why the "before" ordering is necessary, not just possible.
- The justification in the LLM answer is brief and confirms correctness for the example sequence, but **it lacks the general proof of impossibility of firing T5 after T3**, which is required by the user prompt ("if yes... and justify briefly").
- The LLM marks p3=0, p2=1 after T5 fires (which is correct), but it could be slightly clearer that, after T5 fires, T3 can still fire, as the ground truth demonstrates.

In summary, the sequence shown is correct, and the essential mechanism (inhibitor arc prevents T5 after T3) is alluded to, but the LLM misses deeper explanation, completeness, and precision required by the prompt. For these reasons, significant marks are lost, but the answer is basically correct and not misleading, so 7.0 is appropriate.
