The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3 and provides a valid, concise firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) with accurate markings and a brief justification matching the prompt's requirements. However, it differs from the ground truth in several ways that warrant deductions under strict evaluation: (1) it lacks the ground truth's stronger phrasing ("can, and indeed must") and deeper explanation of T5's permanent disablement after T3 fires; (2) the sequence is shorter, omitting post-T5 firings (including T3, though this is not strictly required); (3) it does not elaborate on the inhibitor arc's broader implications or T4's role. These omissions represent meaningful differences in completeness and analytical depth, despite the LLM answer being error-free and sufficient for the prompt. Note: The ground truth sequence contains an inconsistency (T4 cannot fire after T5 and T3 due to p3=0), but evaluation focuses on alignment differences rather than critiquing the ground truth itself.
