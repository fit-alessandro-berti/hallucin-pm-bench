The LLM's answer correctly identifies the right process bottleneck and proposes reducing the camunda:dueDate from "P5D" to "P2D" on Task_CollectEquipment, matching the ground truth in the core modification. However, the LLM introduces two significant, non-compliant changes: adding camunda:priority="100" and camunda:assignee="${equipmentCoordinator}". According to the rules, only one attribute modification is allowedâ€”either a change (e.g., due date), or at most a minimal, necessary amendment, and absolutely not adding/deleting additional attributes unless strictly necessary. Additionally, the ground truth expects only the dueDate change.

These extra attribute additions go against the task rules and are not present in the ground truth; the rationale also references these unjustified elements. For these reasons, substantial points must be deducted for over-modification and divergence from the expected precision. Nevertheless, the answer is not a complete failure, since the core change is correct and well-motivated.
