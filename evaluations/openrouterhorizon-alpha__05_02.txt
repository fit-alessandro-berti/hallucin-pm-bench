The LLM answer correctly identifies the bottleneck task and applies the key dueDate modification matching the ground truth, but it deducts significant points for introducing unauthorized extra attributes (priority and assignee) that exceed the "exactly ONE improvement" rule and alter the minimal scope of the expected change; additionally, the diff format deviates from the strict unified diff specification with extraneous headers, and the rationale expands beyond the concise, precise phrasing in the ground truth by referencing unmentioned elements like "critical path" and "bottleneck" without aligning to the 3-day SLA detail.
