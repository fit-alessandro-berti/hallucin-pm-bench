The LLM answer is identical to the ground truth answer, with no differences in values, structure, or content. All questions (Q1 through Q5) match exactly, including the list in Q5, which correctly identifies activities that never appear as the first event. This demonstrates perfect adherence to the prompt's requirements and the event log facts.
