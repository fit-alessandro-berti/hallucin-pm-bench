**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (mandated terms)**: Perfect use of “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst” (+1.0). No violations.
- **Roles/Columns**: Uses only 3 roles (missing "Operations Manager" from GT, which is A in nearly every GT row); introduces no unauthorized roles but fails to match GT structure (-1.5).
- **Tasks coverage and mapping**: Covers *every* source step but **over-splits** (e.g., separate "Receive" and "Log"; adds explicit "Send SWIFT message" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison..." as new rows not consolidated in GT); 9 tasks vs. GT's 6 precisely mapped/consolidated phrasings (e.g., GT combines receive/log into "Receive Payment Instruction"; omits SWIFT/notify as explicit tasks; uses exact titles like "Screen Against Sanctions List", "Archive Record"). Excessive granularity and additions = major deviation (-2.0).
- **RACI assignments**: Completely divergent from GT across *all* comparable tasks (e.g., GT consistently assigns **A** to Operations Manager; TA often **R** only; LLM combines "R/A" into single cells, altering semantics; e.g., KYC: LLM "C | R/A | I" vs. GT "C | **R** | **A** | I"; similar mismatches for Screen, Approve, Release, Archive). No row fully matches (-2.5).
- **Formatting & Structure**: Markdown table is clear, but lacks GT's "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header, bolded single **R**/**A** letters (uses combined R/A), "(mandated wording)" note implication, and exact Legend phrasing. Extra "if applicable" and verbose titles add noise (-0.8).
- **Overall fidelity to prompt via GT**: Prompt requires *exact* mapping "without omissions or substitutions" per GT note; LLM expands/rewrites instead of matching GT's concise, inferred structure. Strict penalty for cumulative mismatches.

**Total: 3.2/10.0** (Partial credit for vocab/RACI basics and full source coverage, but structural/assignment deviations dominate under "utmost strictness").
