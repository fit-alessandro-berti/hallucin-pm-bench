The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core message (impossibility due to missing timestamps/durations) and adheres to the system instruction ("cannot be derived"). It matches the query's numbered structure perfectly, explicitly notes redaction (faithful to context), and correctly dismisses benchmarks. Minor deductions for: plural "cycle times" (vs. singular focus), omission of "ordering information" or "fabricated" warning phrasing, and extra benchmark detail (accurate but not in ground truth, introducing slight divergence). Semantically equivalent, but strict phrasing/wording diffs warrant ~0.8 loss.
