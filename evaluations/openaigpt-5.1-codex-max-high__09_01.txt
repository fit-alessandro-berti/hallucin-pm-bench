**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, structure (numbered 1) and 2) matching the query), and reasoning. It precisely identifies the absence of timestamps/elapsed durations, dismisses irrelevant historical benchmarks (an enhancement not contradicting ground truth), and adheres to the system policy by clearly refusing unsupported computation. Minor phrasing variations ("derived" vs. "computed"; "log" vs. "information provided") are stylistic, not substantive errors under strict evaluation. No fabrication, no numeric output, full compliance.
