The LLM answer correctly identifies that computation is impossible due to the absence of data (redacted rows and timestamps), precisely explains why (no start/complete times for "Approve Invoice", need multiple for std dev/CI), avoids guessing or using external/SLA data, and covers all tasks. However, strict deductions for: (1) markdown structure (#, ## headers) violating "plain text, no tables" instruction; (2) not strictly "one short paragraph" (split into sections, more verbose than ground truth); (3) minor phrasing differences (e.g., "no actual data has been provided" vs. ground truth's "necessary data are absent"; adds "no activity names" despite header present; "establish a distribution" vs. "dispersion"). Content is 95% aligned, but format/phrasing errors warrant ~1.8-point loss.
