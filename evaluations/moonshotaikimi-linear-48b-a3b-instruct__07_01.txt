### Evaluation Rationale
- **Structure and Headings (2/10)**: Headings match the required format exactly ("• Added tasks", etc.), which is a strong positive. However, sub-listing uses inconsistent bullets ("–") compared to ground truth's asterisks ("*"), and lacks the bold formatting or explicit "(No other differences should be reported.)" note, introducing minor but noticeable formatting deviations under strict scrutiny.
- **Added Tasks (3/10)**: Correctly identifies one added task ("Check Customer VIP Status", matching the XML name attribute), but completely omits the second added task ("Generate RMA QR Code", id="generate_qr"). No inclusion of IDs as in ground truth, which are factual XML elements essential for precise identification. This is a major factual omission (half the category missing), warranting severe deduction.
- **Removed Tasks (7/10)**: Correctly identifies the removed task ("Send RMA Label", matching XML name), but omits the ID ("send_rma_label") present in ground truth. This is a small but strict error (missing precise XML reference), leading to point loss.
- **Gateway Type Changes (6/10)**: Correctly notes the change for "gw_valid" from exclusive to inclusive, using XML element types. However, the phrasing ("gw_valid / Exclusive Gateway → inclusiveGateway") is approximate and lacks the explicit versioning ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)") and bolding in ground truth, making it less precise. No speculation, which is good, but not a full match.
- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness (Adjusted Total: 4.0)**: The response stays factual and grouped as required, with no speculation or extras, but the critical miss of one added task (a core factual difference) and consistent omission of IDs (small but repeated errors across categories) significantly undermine accuracy. Under utmost strictness, this halves the potential score from a partial match, as differences from ground truth are substantive rather than trivial. No other categories like flows or events are invented, avoiding further penalties.
