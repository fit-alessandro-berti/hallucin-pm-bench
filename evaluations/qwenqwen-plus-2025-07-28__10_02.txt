4.0

**Evaluation Breakdown:**

1. **Vocabulary Mandate:**  
   The LLM answer strictly uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst", and does not use forbidden synonyms such as "Compliance Officer", "CDD", etc. **(+1 point)**

2. **Coverage of Steps:**
   - All the key process steps are captured (receiving/logging instructions, sanctions screening, KYC Review, high-risk approval, payment release, SWIFT, archiving), so omission is minimal. **(+1 point)**
   - However, terminology for tasks often does **not** match the mandated wording in the ground truth. For example, "KYC Review" should be the explicit activity name (instead of "Perform KYC Review..."), "Receive Payment Instruction" (not "Receive and log transfer instruction"), "Archive Record" (not "Archive case file").  
   - The "Operations Manager" role from ground truth is **omitted**. This key RACI actor is completely absent, which is a major error. **(-2 points)**

3. **RACI Assignment:**
   - The ground truth carefully distinguishes *Responsible*, *Accountable*, *Consulted*, and *Informed* roles, including the (implied) Operations Manager as Accountable for each key step.
   - The LLM answer often marks the same role as both Responsible and Accountable, which is an oversimplification. **(-0.5 points)**
   - For "Screen payment against sanctions list", ground truth has Regulatory Liaison as Accountable, but LLM says Transaction Analyst is both Responsible and Accountable, and Regulatory Liaison is Consulted. **(-0.5 points)**
   - For several steps in the LLM answer, *Consulted* or *Informed* are omitted where the ground truth has them (and vice versa), e.g. "Consulted" is blank even though roles should be consulted or informed. **(-0.5 points total)**
   - IT Support is not included in every row where required; "Ensure SWIFT message" is a granular sub-step not presented as a top-level activity in the ground truth. **(-0.5 points)**

4. **Formatting/Structure:**
   - Markdown formatting is correct and clear. **(+1 point)**
   - Column headers do not make clear the mandated activity wording as in the ground truth, e.g., "KYC Review" as an activity, not "Perform KYC Review".
   - The legend for R/A/C/I is missing. **(-0.5 points)**

5. **Fidelity to Mandate:**
   - There are several small but meaningful deviations from the explicit instruction to use only enforced synonyms for activity names, not just roles.
   - Not mapping 1:1 from the informal source text to the explicit mandated task names is a significant error for such strict criteria. **(-1 point)**

**Summary:**  
- Strict synonym adherence was good for roles, but task/step names often did not strictly follow the enforced wording.
- Omission of the "Operations Manager" role as Accountable is a major error.
- RACI assignments and mappings have multiple inaccuracies compared to ground truth, with oversimplified assignments and some missing/inappropriate markings.
- Formatting/structure has minor issues.

**Therefore, the LLM answer merits a 4.0.**
