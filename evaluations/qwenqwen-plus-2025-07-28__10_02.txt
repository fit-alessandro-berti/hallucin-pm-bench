### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") throughout tasks and roles without deviations. It covers all key steps from the source text (7 tasks, including splitting "release" and "SWIFT send" explicitly, which aligns with the informal description's granularity). The Markdown table format is clear and organized as required.
- **Major Weaknesses (significant deductions)**: 
  - **Structure mismatch**: Uses traditional RACI columns (Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed) with roles filled in cells, rather than the ground truth's role-based columns (Transaction Analyst/Regulatory Liaison/Operations Manager/IT Support) with R/A/C/I letters in cells. This inverts the standard RACI presentation expected by the ground truth, leading to a non-equivalent matrix.
  - **Roles omission/inaccuracy**: Omits "Operations Manager" entirely (present in every ground truth row as primarily Accountable), introducing a critical gap. IT Support is included but assignments differ. Over-relies on single roles for both R and A (e.g., Transaction Analyst for receiving/logging), violating nuanced RACI distribution in ground truth.
  - **Task mappings and wording differences**: Tasks are mostly covered but phrased differently (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"; adds "after approval" to release, not in ground truth). Separates "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" as a distinct task (not explicitly in ground truth, which combines into "Release Payment"). "KYC Review" lacks "on sender and beneficiary" detail, and approval task pluralizes differently.
  - **RACI assignments**: Vast discrepancies across all rows (e.g., screening: LLM has Transaction Analyst R/A with Regulatory Liaison consulted; ground truth has Transaction Analyst R, Regulatory Liaison A, Operations Manager I, IT Support C. Similar mismatches for every task, with ground truth consistently assigning A to Operations Manager and spreading C/I more broadly). No bolding or legend as in ground truth.
  - **Completeness/extras**: Includes an extra task split not mirrored in ground truth; lacks ground truth's notes on vocabulary adherence and "mandated wording" emphasis in the task column header.
- **Strictness applied**: Even minor phrasing variances (e.g., task titles) and absence of legend/notation deduct heavily, as per instructions. Overall fidelity is low (~30% alignment due to core structural and assignment errors), justifying a failing-to-mediocre score.
