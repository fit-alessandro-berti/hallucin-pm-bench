• Added tasks  
The LLM answer lists the ids "check_vip" and "generate_qr" only. While these are correct, it omits the task names, which the ground truth includes. This isn't a major error if we assume "element names exactly as they appear in the XML" refers to ids, but it could be stricter about mirroring the format.

• Removed tasks  
The LLM answer says "(none)", but "send_rma_label" is present in v1 and not in v2, so it should be listed as removed. This is a very significant omission.

• Gateway type changes  
The LLM answer correctly identifies the change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway for "gw_valid". However, it omits the XML element notation used in the ground truth and only lists the id without bold formatting or explanation ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway" instead of "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"). This is a minor error.

Overall, the failure to detect the removed task is a major problem, and the lack of detail in other sections loses minor points. The score is significantly reduced, but correct changes are still detected.
