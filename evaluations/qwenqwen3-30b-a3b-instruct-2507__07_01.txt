### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: Partial match. The LLM correctly identifies the two added tasks by their IDs (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), which appear exactly in the XML. However, it fails to include the full task names ("Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code") as shown in the XML's `name` attributes, which the ground truth does for clarity and completeness. The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear," and while IDs are part of this, the ground truth's approach (name + ID) better aligns with reporting factual XML content without speculation. This is a minor but notable incompleteness, warranting a deduction.
  
- **Removed tasks**: Major error. The LLM incorrectly reports "(none)," missing the clear removal of the `send_rma_label` task (name="Send RMA Label"), which is present in v1 (after `approve_return`) but absent in v2 (replaced by `generate_qr`). This is a factual omission directly readable from the XML snippets, violating the core instruction to list only factual differences without speculation. Under strict evaluation, this alone justifies a severe penalty, as it misrepresents a key change.

- **Gateway type changes**: Strong match. The LLM accurately notes the change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`, using exact XML element types. The ground truth adds version specifics (v1/v2) for context, but the LLM's concise format aligns with the prompt's focus on factual differences. Minor deduction for not specifying versions, but this is not strictly required.

Overall, the response follows the required headings and bullet style closely but is undermined by the critical miss on removed tasks (a full category error) and incomplete task reporting, leading to a low score despite partial accuracy elsewhere. No speculation is present, which is positive, but strictness demands significant loss for these discrepancies.
