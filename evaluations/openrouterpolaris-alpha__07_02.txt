8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment, preserving most points):** The core content matches closely. Added tasks correctly identify all three new tasks with IDs and names. Removed tasks correctly identify the single removal. Gateway-type change accurately notes the shift from exclusive to inclusive for the specified gateway ID.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness):** 
  - Formatting inconsistencies: Uses plain bullets and parenthetical names (ID first), while ground truth employs numbered lists with bolded names first and backticked IDs. Headings lack markdown bolding/asterisks.
  - Extraneous details in gateway section: Includes "(with updated outgoing branches and labels)", which violates the "ignore cosmetic renamings or reordered XML lines" instruction (flow labels like "yes" to "eligible" are cosmetic; branch updates are covered elsewhere via added tasks). Ground truth avoids this, focusing solely on type (using BPMN terminology "exclusive (XOR)" vs. LLM's XML tags "exclusiveGateway").
  - Missing elements: No version references (v1/v2), no closing note confirming no other changes, and slightly less precise terminology (e.g., no XOR/OR abbreviations).
- **Overall:** ~85% match in content fidelity, but small errors (extras, formatting, precision) warrant a deduct of 2.0 points under utmost strictness.
