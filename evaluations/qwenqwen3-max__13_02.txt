9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, not part of the scored response):
- **Question 1**: Exact match (1 occurrence). No deduction.
- **Question 2a**: Correct calculation and value (2.08%). Minor formatting issue (missing space before "%" vs. ground truth's "2.08 %"); deduct 0.1 for strict adherence to presentation.
- **Question 2b**: Correct calculation and value (8.33%). Same minor formatting issue; deduct 0.1.
- **Question 3**: Within word limit (78 words). Covers all required elements: (i) single-occurrence explicitly ("only 1 of 12 cases", "sparse occurrence"); (ii) notes variance/instability indirectly via "skew performance metrics" and "mislead...overestimating relevance" (implies instability but lacks explicit terms like "noise" or "confidence intervals" from sample); (iii) cautions against over-generalization clearly ("generalizing...can skew", "inaccurate...forecasts"). Strong but not verbatim; deduct 0.7 for slightly less precise alignment on variance phrasing under utmost strictness.
- **Overall**: High fidelity to ground truth; deductions only for nitpicks in format and subtle wording nuance.
