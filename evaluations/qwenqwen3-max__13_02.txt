9.3

1. The LLM answer for question 1 is correct: "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs once.
2. For 2a ("all events"): The LLM correctly calculates 1/48 ≈ 2.08%.
3. For 2b ("all unique cases"): The LLM correctly calculates 1/12 ≈ 8.33%.
4. For 3: The answer mentions "lacks statistical significance", "risk of overfitting", "distorting metrics", and "misrepresenting patterns". It notes rarity and the risk of generalizing from a single occurrence, satisfying points (i) and (iii). While "statistical significance" and "risk of overfitting" do communicate high variance/instability, it could have been a touch more explicit regarding how a single event can leading to wide confidence intervals or unstable statistics (point ii in the rubric). But the context and intent are clear and concise, and the caution is strong.

Small markdown: Could have been slightly more explicit about statistical instability, but overall, the wording is accurate and meets the strict requirements.

No numeric or factual error detected. No invented or omitted information. Markdown only for the minor lack of explicit variance explanation.

**Final score:** 9.3
