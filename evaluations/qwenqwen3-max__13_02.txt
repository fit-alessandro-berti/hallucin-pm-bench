The LLM answer is nearly perfect for questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth exactly in counts and percentages (full points). For question 3, the explanation is concise (â‰¤100 words), cautions against over-generalization (iii), and notes instability via lack of significance, overfitting, and distortion (ii). However, it implicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue through "low-support" and percentages rather than explicitly stating "only once" or "single occurrence" as emphasized in the ground truth sample (i), which is a minor but notable omission under strict evaluation.
