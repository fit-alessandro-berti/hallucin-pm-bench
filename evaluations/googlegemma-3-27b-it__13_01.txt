The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt's constraints. It answers all questions correctly without hallucinations or inferences beyond the log data. For Q4, the two reasons provided (small sample size and temporal bias) directly match two of the ground truth's specified examples, with clear and appropriate explanations derived solely from the fragment (4 cases, one day). Minor phrasing variations (e.g., bolding, slight rewording) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as the substance is precise.
