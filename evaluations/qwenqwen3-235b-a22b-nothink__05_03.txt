### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by adding a boundary timer event on `Activity_CreateAccount` with a 48-hour duration (PT48H) and routing it via sequence flow to the pre-existing `Activity_AMReview` for escalation, while providing a concise one-sentence justification focused on SLA enforcement without new activities. Minor deductions for: (1) omitting the explicit `cancelActivity="true"` attribute (though BPMN defaults to interrupting, explicit specification matches ground truth strictness, -0.4 points); (2) slightly less precise justification wording (lacks "interrupting" and "routing the timeout" phrasing, -0.2 points); (3) cosmetic differences in IDs/names (e.g., "BreachTimer" vs. "Boundary_LateCreate") and absence of clarifying comments (-0.2 points). No major structural errors, and the approximation of timer start (post-gateway) is consistent with ground truth despite not perfectly measuring from Verify Identity end.
