The LLM answer correctly and explicitly states that the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the available data, because all temporal data (timestamps and elapsed times) are missing. It gives a thorough explanation of the reasoning, directly referencing the absence of necessary data fields. It also points out the irrelevance of the historical benchmark due to segment/extract mismatch. There are no errors, omissions, or unjustified assumptions, and its answer matches the ground truth almost verbatim (albeit with slightly different wording). No points should be deducted.
