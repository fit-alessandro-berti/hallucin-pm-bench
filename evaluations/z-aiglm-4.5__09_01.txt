The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth, correctly refusing to provide a numeric value and explaining the impossibility due to redacted timestamps and missing duration data, which is essential for cycle time. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., explicitly labeling the benchmark as "irrelevant" and referencing specific columns, which are accurate but add detail not in the ground truth) and not emphasizing "ordering information" or "fabricated" answers verbatim, though these do not alter the core correctness under strict evaluation.
