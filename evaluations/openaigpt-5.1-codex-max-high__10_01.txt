3.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Vocabulary policy adherence (mandated, +2.0 max)**: Perfect. Uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly; no forbidden terms. (+2.0)
- **Structure & format (table shape, rows/columns, no extras, +3.0 max)**: Basic table present, correct 6 activities + 4 roles, no added tasks/roles/columns. But unwarranted intro text ("Here’s the RACI matrix..."); abbreviated headers vs. ground truth full names; no bolding on key cells/activity names; inconsistent markdown spacing/alignment; A/R notation vs. **R / A**, **R**, **A**, **C**. Significant deviations. (+1.0)
- **RACI correctness (core content, +5.0 max)**: Major failures. Must reflect narrative/GT exactly.
  | Activity | Matches (ignoring A/R vs. R/A notation) | Errors |
  |----------|------------------|---------|
  | Receive Application | AM (2/3), FC/IT (match) | CO: I ≠ **C** |
  | **KYC Review** | IT (match) | AM: I ≠ **A**; CO: A/R ≠ **R**; FC: I ≠ C |
  | **Order Vetting** | AM (2/3), FC/IT (match) | CO: I ≠ C |
  | **Payment Clearance** | IT (match) | AM: I ≠ A; CO: I ≠ C; FC: A/R ≠ **R** |
  | Record Update | None | AM: I ≠ C; CO/FC: I ≠ I/C; IT: A/R ≠ **R** (extras I's) |
  | Notify Customer | All (notation only) | None |
  - No row has exactly one **R** matching GT; misses all **C** roles (e.g., CO/FC consulted in multiple); AM accountability misplaced; >70% cells differ. Violates "RACI allocations reflect the narrative" (one R/activity, AM accountable appropriately). (+0.2)
- **Total**: 3.2. Strict penalty for RACI errors (primary deliverable) and format mismatches; minor credit for terms/structure/shape.
