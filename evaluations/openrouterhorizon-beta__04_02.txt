3.5

R1: The LLM answer incorrectly marks this as "Violated." While it references the late re-approval, the rule only requires initial Manager then Finance approvals for the amount; the late Manager_Approval is relevant to R5 only, not R1. The ground truth correctly marks R1 as "Compliant." This is a major error (incorrect rule interpretation).

R2: The LLM answer incorrectly marks this as "Compliant." The ground truth correctly marks as "Violated"—because after a Change_Request (which requires re-approval per R5), Ship_Goods happens 2 days BEFORE the new Manager_Approval, so no valid approval precedes shipment, and the timing after the last (proper) approval is > 2 days. This is another major error (failure to properly link rules about re-approval).

R3: Correctly marked "Violated" and accurate justification.

R4: Correctly "Not Applicable" and justification adequate.

R5: Correctly "Violated" and justification is generally correct.

R6: Correctly "Compliant" and justification is concise.

Overall result: Correctly "NON-COMPLIANT."

Summary: 3 major rule marking errors (R1, R2) out of 6, half the rules, and the corresponding justifications carry the mistakes. Only R3–R6 are correct, and the mistakes are in the most critical compliance rules. The output format follows requirements but content errors are severe, thus a score of **3.5** is justified.
