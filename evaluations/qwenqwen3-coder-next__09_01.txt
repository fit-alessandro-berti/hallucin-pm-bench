The LLM answer is an exact semantic and factual match to the ground truth: both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed, provide equivalent strict reasoning focused on absent timestamps/durations (with LLM's column-specific details and cycle-time definition being precise enhancements, not deviations), reject any inference from extraneous data (LLM explicitly via benchmarks note; implicitly aligned in ground truth), and address both prompt questions (answer + explanation). No errors, fabrications, or omissions under utmost strictness.
