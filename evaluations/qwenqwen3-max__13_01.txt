9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match to ground truth (exact count of 1). No deductions. (10/10)
- **Question 2**: Perfect match, including calculation and rounding to two decimal places. (10/10)
- **Question 3**: Core content matches (identifies A1002 as the sole case), but minor wording omission of "only" introduces a subtle imprecision in phrasing compared to ground truth. (9/10)
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid, clearly stated sampling-related reasons that align directly with ground truth options ("small sample size" and "temporal bias/non-representative time window"). No unjustified inferences; details (e.g., single day, monthly generalization) are derived from the log. Slight over-elaboration in examples (e.g., weekends/holidays) is unnecessary but not erroneous. (10/10)

**Overall Rationale**: The LLM answer is highly accurate, deriving all responses strictly from the 18 log lines without hallucination or external assumptions. Total deductions are minimal (1 point for Q3 phrasing under strict criteria), yielding a near-perfect score. Differences are negligible and do not alter factual correctness.
