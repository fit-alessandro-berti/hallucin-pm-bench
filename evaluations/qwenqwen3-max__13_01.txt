9.5

1. The answer "1" is correct.

2. "5.56%" is correct, the calculation is explicitly shown and accurate.

3. "A1002" is correct.

4. The two reasons given are:  
   - Small sample size (only 1 occurrence), making any extrapolation unreliable — this matches the ground truth.
   - Fragment only covers a few hours on a single day, which may not be representative of other days or weeks — matches the temporal bias point from ground truth.
   
These are concise, accurate, and do not rely on any information not present in the log fragment, matching the strict constraints. The only minor markdown:
- For question 3, "List the case identifier(s) that contain…", the answer is just "A1002", but the ideal answer gave "Only case A1002 contains ...", which is slightly fuller; however, giving solely "A1002" is unambiguous and direct, so any markdown for this is extremely minor.
- For question 2, the model rounds and shows a formula. The ground truth also does so.

No information is hallucinated. All answers are directly and strictly derived from the given log lines.

Final score: 9.5 (minor markdown for less explicit phrasing in Q3; otherwise, the answer is strict, accurate, faithful, and thorough).
