The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can run in parallel (per the process description and rationale), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified one-per-line format with the em dash (—). The output is concise and ignores Process A as instructed.

Minor deduction (-0.5) for whitespace inconsistency with ground truth: the second line uses 2 spaces before "—" (matching the literal format example `Task_X  —  Task_Y`), while ground truth adds extra spaces (~5-6) for visual alignment in monospace (unrequired by instructions). Under utmost strictness, this whitespace difference counts as a small formatting error warranting a notable but limited penalty; content and structure are otherwise identical.
