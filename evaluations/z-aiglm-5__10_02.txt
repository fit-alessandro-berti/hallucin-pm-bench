**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary Compliance (strong match, +1.5 points)**: LLM correctly and exclusively uses "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison" throughout, matching the mandate and GT notes. No violations.
- **Table Format (partial match, +1.0 point)**: Markdown RACI table present with clear headers, bolded activities, and legend/key. However, extra title, notes section, and "Key" diverge from GT's minimal table + legend structure (-0.5 for additions).
- **Tasks Coverage & Wording (poor match, -2.5 points)**:
  | Aspect | Differences |
  |--------|-------------|
  | Count | LLM: 7 tasks (adds "Transmit SWIFT message" as #6 and splits #7 "Archive case file"); GT: 6 tasks (omits explicit SWIFT, combines archive). |
  | Phrasing | LLM: Descriptive (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction", "Perform KYC Review (Sender & Beneficiary)"); GT: Concise (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "**KYC Review**" bolded without extras). Extra details and split = deviation. |
  | Mapping | Covers source but expands/omits fidelity (e.g., no "notified" explicit; GT uses "Archive Record"). |
- **Roles/Columns (mismatch, -1.5 points)**: LLM: 3 columns (TA, RL, IT Support) – faithful to source. GT: 4 columns (adds "Operations Manager" not in source/mandate). LLM avoids fabrication but doesn't match GT exactly.
- **RACI Assignments (major mismatch, -3.3 points)**: Fundamentally different across nearly all cells (strict cell-by-cell):
  | Task (approx.) | LLM | GT | Match? |
  |----------------|-----|----|--------|
  | 1. Receive/Log | TA R/A, RL I | TA R, RL I, OM A, IT C | Partial (TA/RL similar, ignores OM/IT) |
  | 2. Screen | TA R, RL A | TA R, RL A, OM I, IT C | Partial (core match, extras differ) |
  | 3. KYC | TA I, RL R/A | TA C, RL R, OM A, IT I | Diff (TA I vs C; RL split vs single) |
  | 4. Approve | TA I, RL A | TA C, RL R, OM A, IT I | Diff (RL A vs R; TA I vs C) |
  | 5. Release | TA R, RL A | TA R, RL I, OM A, IT C | Diff (RL A vs I) |
  | 6. SWIFT/Archive | Split into two; IT R/A, RL I both | Single "Archive": TA C, RL I, OM A, IT R | Major diff (split + assignments) |
  - ~70% cells diverge; no full row matches. Core RACI purpose fails.
- **Overall Fidelity (low, base 1.0 + adjustments)**: Covers source intent but deviates in structure/content from GT. Extra content/notes = bloat. Strict penalty for every mismatch per instructions.

Total reflects utmost strictness: correct vocab saves it from 1.0, but RACI/task errors dominate.
