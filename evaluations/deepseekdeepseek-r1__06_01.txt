9.5

The LLM answer contains both correct parallel task pairs in Process B and lists them in proper alphabetical order, both within each pair and overall. However, a minor but significant difference exists: the LLM’s formatting omits the extra spaces used for alignment in the ground truth (“Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines” vs. “Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines”). Even though the logical content is correct, this discrepancy in output format—specifically around spacing/alignment—should result in a nontrivial deduction per the prompt’s strict evaluation guideline, where small errors warrant significant loss of points. Therefore, the answer is downgraded from a perfect score to 9.5.
