The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and format (one pair per line with the specified structure). The minor spacing difference in the second line (alignment of the em dash in the ground truth) is not required by the prompt's format specification and does not constitute an error.
