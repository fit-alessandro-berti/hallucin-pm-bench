The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides a precise, evidence-based justification by citing the two relevant counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with accurate activity sequences and timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim in the FACT. This aligns well with the task requirements and the ground truth's core conclusion. However, it deducts a point for lacking the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case analysis of all four cases (omitting C001 and C003, where the sequence holds), which provides fuller context despite not being strictly requiredâ€”under utmost strictness, this omission is a minor but notable difference in thoroughness.
