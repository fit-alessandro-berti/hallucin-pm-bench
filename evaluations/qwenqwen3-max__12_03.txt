The LLM answer accurately provides a "No" to the question and supports the reasoning by correctly identifying the relevant cases (C002 and C004) and showing the intervening activities between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment." This thoroughly demonstrates that the FACT is inaccurate.

However, compared to the ground truth answer, the justification is less comprehensive:
- The LLM omits explicitly noting the cases (C001 and C003) where the FACT *is* true (i.e., "Validate_Payment" does follow immediately after "Receive_Order").
- There is no tabulated or systematic per-case analysis, nor does it mention the partial fulfillment (2 out of 4 cases fit the pattern, 2 do not), a nuance present in the ground truth.
- The language is slightly less rigorous ("sometimes occur in between," rather than quantifying or specifying the fraction).

Overall, the answer is correct, well-cited, and meets the factual requirement, but the lack of a systematic, all-case review and minor gaps in explicitness compared to the ground truth justify deducting 2 points.
