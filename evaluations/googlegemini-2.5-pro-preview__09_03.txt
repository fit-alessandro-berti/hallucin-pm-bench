9.5

The LLM answer provides a thorough and precise explanation, covering every point in the prompt and aligning closely with the ground truth. It states clearly that the requested metrics cannot be computed due to the absence of necessary data—specifically, the missing event log rows and timestamps—which matches the reasoning in the ground truth.

The sole (and minor) difference is that the LLM answer is slightly more verbose, including explicit mention that Artefact B's aggregated KPIs and SLAs are not a suitable substitute for the missing granular data, whereas the ground truth omits this clarification. While this extra explanation does not contradict the ground truth, it goes slightly beyond the requested brevity and focus, which the ground truth models.

Because the output fully avoids guessing, clearly states the issue, and does not make any computational attempt, it satisfies the main criteria. The extra wording, however, reflects a small divergence in tone and conciseness, justifying a slight deduction.

Thus, the answer merits a 9.5.
