**8.0**

Q1-Q4 exactly match the ground truth (perfect). Q5 completely mismatches (wrong items, wrong count: 1 incorrect activity instead of 3 correct ones). Output format violates "exactly this JSON schema" by including extraneous Python code and explanation (significant deduction under strictness). Method relies on fragile fragment order (not timestamp-sorted per case), incorrect for shuffled log, but incidental correctness on Q1-Q4 limits further penalty. Overall: major Q5 error + format violation deduct 2.0 points from 10.0.
