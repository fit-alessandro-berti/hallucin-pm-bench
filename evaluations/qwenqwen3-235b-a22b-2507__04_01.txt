The LLM answer reaches the correct overall conclusion ("Non-compliant") and accurately identifies the violations in Rules 2 and 3, as well as satisfaction of Rules 1, 4, and 5, aligning closely with the ground truth in substance. However, it incurs deductions for: (1) messy, verbose structure with initial incorrect "Compliant" judgment, internal self-corrections, and re-analyses that deviate from a clean, direct response; (2) failure to follow the specified format by not providing a fully numbered justification (1-5) for all rules in the final outputâ€”instead, the concluding section numbers only 2 and 3 while omitting explicit recaps of 1, 4, and 5; (3) minor overstatement in Rule 3 distance calculation (calls it "four activities after" or "distance=4," while ground truth uses "distance=3," though both correctly flag the violation). These formatting and presentation issues, even if small, warrant significant point loss under strict evaluation criteria, preventing a higher score despite substantive accuracy.
