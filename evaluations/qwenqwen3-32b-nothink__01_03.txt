### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) – Decision Points**: The LLM incorrectly identifies three decision points, including the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a "decision point" (it is merely a risk-rating step that feeds into the actual conditional branch, not a gate or branch itself). This adds a hallucinated/inaccurate element not present in the ground truth, which strictly lists only two (the risk-based skip and TriVote). The descriptions of the actual two points are mostly accurate but include minor inaccuracies: the skip is mislabeled as a "Step 4 conditional" (the process describes the conditional before step 5, after step 3), and the rule phrasing slightly deviates (e.g., "at least two of three" vs. ground truth's "at least two of the three approvers... record 'Approve'"). The extra point and deviations warrant a major deduction for strictness, as they inflate and distort the summary.
  
- **Part (b) – Documents**: The list includes all core items in roughly correct order but has critical omissions and errors: it misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" entirely (a distinct required document in step 8, listed separately in ground truth). It also misorders by placing "ID Matrix Declaration" before the signed offer (which appears concurrently in step 8, but ground truth prioritizes the signed version after the unsigned Offer Sheet 77). Noting "Deck Memo" as "optional" introduces extraneous qualification not in ground truth, potentially implying it's not "required anywhere" despite being part of the process. Scorecards are correctly included as inputs/documents. These gaps and reorderings are significant errors under strict criteria, as the task demands *all* required documents in *first-appearance order* without additions or omissions.

- **Overall**: No hallucinations of excluded elements (e.g., KYC/AML), and the response is structured, but the inaccuracies (extra decision point, missing document, order issue, and unnecessary notes like offering a flowchart) create meaningful differences from the concise, precise ground truth. This reflects partial correctness but fails to match exactly, justifying a mid-low score with heavy penalties for even small deviations.
