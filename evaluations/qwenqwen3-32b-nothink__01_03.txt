**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM answer accurately identifies both major decision points described in the ground truth:  
  - The risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check  
  - The TriVote approval gate

- The LLM’s answer, however, erroneously lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a “decision point.” In the process description, this step alone only produces a risk rating; the actual gateway/decision is the conditional skip/bypass that comes immediately after, as specified in the ground truth. Listing Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a decision point conflates a scoring step with a process fork, which is not strictly accurate.

**b) Documents List**

- The LLM answer lists nearly all required documents but misses “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” which, per the process, is distinct from “Offer Sheet 77.” This is a significant omission. 
- It does, however, properly note the conditionality (“Deck Memo” is only required if the manual underwriting is performed), which is a positive.

**Other Notes**

- No hallucinations are present (e.g., no KYC, AML, or credit-bureau documentation cited).
- Minor style divergences (e.g., use of “optional” for Deck Memo) are acceptable.
- The list order for documents is correct except for the missing “Signed Offer Sheet 77.”

**Summary:**  
The LLM correctly identifies the main process forks and most of the required documents, but introduces a non-gate as a decision point and omits an explicitly-required document. Accordingly, points are significantly deducted for those errors.
