8.0

**Justification for score:**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the trace is non-compliant and gives an accurate judgment for rules 2, 3, and 4, with explicit reasoning for the violation (specifically, that NA occurs before RA is completed). It states that QE and RA both occur once and in the correct order (QE before RA).

However, there are two notable errors:
- Rule 1: The LLM claims that rule 1 is violated, stating "they are not in the correct order" and "QE must be followed directly by RA." The rule only requires that both QE and RA occur once each and in that orderâ€”not necessarily directly consecutively, nor that NA cannot come between them. Per the ground truth, rule 1 should be marked as satisfied.
- The LLM overstates the requirements of rule 1 ("QE must be followed directly by RA"), which is stricter than what the rules require.

Both of these issues represent substantial but not catastrophic deviations from the gold standard. The core violation (rule 3) is identified clearly and explained. The evaluation for rules 2 and 4 is also correct. Thus, 2 points are deducted for the misinterpretation and misstatement of rule 1, resulting in a strict but fair score of 8.0.
