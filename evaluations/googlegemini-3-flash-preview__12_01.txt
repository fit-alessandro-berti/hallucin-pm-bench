The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and evidence-based, correctly deeming the fact inaccurate with proper case citations (using precise timestamps instead of lines) and a strong concluding statement that no instance matches the claimed order. Minor deductions for: (1) suboptimal phrasing on Case 1002 ("impossible to verify" vs. ground truth's clearer "disproved," as absence after Authorize_Refund falsifies "always immediately before"); (2) slight structural differences (e.g., intro summary phrasing, case order, no explicit "short verdict" header); (3) not reiterating "immediately" in counters (though unnecessary since basic precedence fails). Ground truth itself has a line-number error (Case 1003 cites lines 11 & 14, but Update_Inventory is line 12). Under strict evaluation, these small differences warrant a high but imperfect score.
