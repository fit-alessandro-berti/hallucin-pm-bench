4.2

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact three worst activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Accurately quantifies SLA excesses using table data (Avg_Throughput_Time vs. Target_SLA). Uses bullets exclusively for recommendations section. Memo length ≈150 words. No absent activities/metrics invented. Headers evoke executive memo style.
- **Major failures (heavy deductions)**: 
  - Recommendations violate "one concrete, data-driven action **for each**" of the three: Bullets bundle activities (1st covers Risk Review + Legal; 3rd Legal + Draft Offer), misassign (2nd focuses on Verify Identity, not Credit Assessment), and lack distinct per-activity mapping. Not data-driven (invents "senior underwriters," "queue buildup," "handoff delays," "parallel processing" without table support).
  - Ungrounded claims: "Severely underperforming," "significantly impact downstream throughput and customer experience" violate "ground every sentence in data."
  - Structure/order deviates: Wrong activity order (Risk before Legal, despite Legal's superior metrics: 900s/600s wait vs. 600s/480s). Adds unprompted Date. No total cases mention (as in ground truth).
  - Overall fidelity to ground truth low: Different headers/subject, no bolding/prose activity summaries, no projection, mismatched recs phrasing/content.
- **Strictness applied**: Recs (core instruction) earn ~2/10 alone; analysis ~9/10; structure/grounding ~5/10. Weighted average yields 4.2. Small issues (order, extras) deduct further.
