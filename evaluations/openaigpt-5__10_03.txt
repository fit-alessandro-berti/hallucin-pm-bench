### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified in the first four rows, with no disallowed synonyms leaking in. However, the added activities use unauthorized phrasings (e.g., "Compliance Officer approval" instead of the ground truth's "**Compliance Officer Approval**"; "Schedule the payment", "Release the funds", "Notify the originating analyst" which merge/split incorrectly). This violates "using only the authorized vocabulary" and "do not rename, merge, or add activities." Ground truth strictly limits to six activities with precise naming/bolding. Deduction: -2.0 points for additions and renaming.
  
- **Activity Coverage and Structure (Major Errors)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** without adding, merging, or renaming. Ground truth has exactly six activities (four mandated + "**Compliance Officer Approval**" + "**Release Funds**"), interpreting the narrative's escalation, scheduling, release, and notify as consolidated where appropriate. LLM adds four extra rows ("Compliance Officer approval", "Schedule the payment", "Release the funds", "Notify the originating analyst"), incorrectly splitting the Treasury Ops steps (narrative has "schedule the payment" only for low-risk, but merges release/notify post-approval). This bloats the matrix beyond the narrative's scope. No bolding for activity names or R/A entries as in ground truth. Deduction: -3.0 points for extraneous rows, lack of consolidation, and formatting deviations (e.g., plain text vs. **bold**; empty cells vs. "–").

- **RACI Assignments (Significant Inaccuracies)**: Strict comparison shows numerous mismatches, even small ones costing points:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM (Front R/A, Compliance I) vs. Ground (Front **R, A**; Compliance C; Treasury I). Wrong: Compliance I instead of C; missing Treasury I; no "–" for Officer. Deduction: -1.0.
  - **KYC Review**: LLM (Compliance R/A) vs. Ground (Compliance **R, A**; Officer C; Treasury I). Wrong: Missing Officer C and Treasury I; no "–" for Front. Also, format "R/A" vs. "**R, A**". Deduction: -0.8.
  - **AML Screening**: Identical issues to KYC (missing Officer C, Treasury I; format). Deduction: -0.8.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM (Compliance R/A) vs. Ground (Compliance R; Officer **A**; Front C; Treasury I). Major wrong: Combines R/A on Compliance (ignores split and Officer A); missing Front C and Treasury I; no "–" elsewhere. Deduction: -1.2.
  - Added Rows: All mismatch ground truth (e.g., no "Schedule the payment" or separate "Notify"; "Release the funds" misses Compliance C, Officer C; "approval" misses Front I and has extra Treasury I without "–" for others). These non-existent alignments amplify errors. Deduction: -1.0.

- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the core four activities are partially accurate (terms correct, basic structure), earning baseline credit, but pervasive assignment errors (e.g., missing C/I roles, incorrect splits), format lapses (no bold/"–"/commas), and added content violate the prompt's precision. Total differences exceed 70% misalignment, justifying low score. No credit for intent—only fidelity to ground truth.
