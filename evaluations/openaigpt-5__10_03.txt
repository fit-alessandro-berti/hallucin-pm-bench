- The answer uses only the authorized vocabulary for the four activity names, correctly applying "Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," and "Risk Scoring."
- No forbidden synonyms appear in the table.
- However, the answer introduces unapproved activities ("Schedule the payment," "Notify the originating analyst") not present in the ground truth answer and omits the "Release Funds" activity (instead splitting its steps into two rows).
- Consulted (C) and Informed (I) attributions diverge: key discrepancies are present throughout (e.g., missing C for some roles, non-conforming use of R/A), and "Risk Scoring" assigns both Responsible and Accountable to Compliance Analyst without designating A to Compliance Officer as in ground truth.
- The role-to-activity mapping often disagrees with the ground truth (for example, C and I assignments are incomplete or misplaced).
- Table notation differs: "R/A" is used instead of "R, A", and dashes for non-involvement are missing entirely.
- The activity "Compliance Officer approval" and "Release the funds" are split into more granular actions than allowed.
- There are small errors in marking who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed per the ground truth.

Overall, while terminology compliance is good, structure, activity set, and role assignment errors are substantial.
