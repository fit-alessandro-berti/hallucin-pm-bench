The LLM answer is correct in substance (correctly identifies possibility, provides a valid minimal firing sequence T1→T2→T5 where T5 fires before T3, accurate markings, correct enabling condition for inhibitor arc, brief justification aligning with prompt request). However, strict evaluation reveals differences from ground truth warranting deduction:

- **Lack of depth in justification** (-0.4): Misses ground truth's key insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 if ever (due to permanent disablement post-T3), the precise logical condition (`p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0`), and explanation of p4 dynamics/T4 interaction—provides only basic enabling check without proof-like completeness.
- **Incomplete sequence** (-0.2): Stops at T5 (sufficient for question but contrasts ground truth's full sequence showing T3 *after* T5 and T4, illustrating disablement).
- **Formatting/presentation** (-0.1): Less structured (no numbered steps, bolding, inline arrows/markings per transition, or full post-T5 context); notation `{pX:1}` vs. ground truth's ``pX = 1`` is minor but divergent.
- **Phrasing** (-0.1): Simpler "**Yes.**" vs. ground truth's "**Yes — T5 can, and indeed must...**"; no explicit "before T3" in sequence header (implied only in justification).

No factual errors, but cumulative differences in completeness, elaboration, and polish reduce from perfect match.
