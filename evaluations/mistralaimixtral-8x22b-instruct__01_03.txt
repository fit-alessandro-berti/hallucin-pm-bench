**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) – Decision Points (≈7/10):** Identifies the exact two decision points correctly. Rule summaries are accurate in substance (Low/Medium + ≤ €250k skip; ≥2/3 approvals suffice). Minor deductions for: phrasing deviations (e.g., "skip Step 5" vs. ground truth's descriptive "bypasses... otherwise proceeds"; no explicit "record 'Approve'"; currency formatting €250,000 vs. €250 000; added step references not in ground truth). Still strong match.
- **Part (b) – Documents (≈0/10):** Critically incomplete and erroneous. Ground truth lists **9** documents in precise first-appearance order: Form 14B → 3 Scorecards (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow, explicit step-3 inputs) → Deck Memo → Offer Sheet 77 → **Signed** Offer Sheet 77 → ID Matrix Declaration → Loan Dossier 2025. LLM misses **all 3 Scorecards** (core process inputs), fails to distinguish "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as separate (step 8), lists only **5** items, and errs on order (e.g., Deck Memo too early, pre-Scorecards). No hallucinations (good), but massive omissions/distortions = failure.
- **Overall:** Weighted average heavily penalizes (b)'s catastrophic gaps (44% of ground truth docs missed; wrong order). Strict policy demands major point loss for such differences; no leniency for partial credit on (b).
