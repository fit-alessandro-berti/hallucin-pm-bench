The LLM answer correctly included both ground-truth pairs:
- `Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check`
- `Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`

However, it also erroneously listed 5 additional pairs:
- `Fabricate  —  Quality_Check`
- `Fabricate  —  Procure_Materials`
- `Fabricate  —  Schedule_Machines`
- `Procure_Materials  —  Quality_Check`
- `Schedule_Machines  —  Quality_Check`

These additional pairs are **not allowed** per the process description, as they ignore task dependencies and timing windows. For instance, Fabricate and Quality_Check cannot be parallel since Quality_Check only starts after Fabricate is completed.

This is a severe error for process mining and strict process modeling tasks, as it shows failure to properly interpret task dependencies and valid parallelism constraints. The LLM also gave no rationale or caveats, and did not attend to the strictness of "every pair that CAN be executed in parallel".

Deductions:
- Major conceptual mistake: -6 points
- Listing both correct pairs, but not exclusively: +2 points
- Extra pairs, lack of process rigor: -2 points

Final score: **2.0** (very poor, as the presence of additional pairs constitutes a critical misunderstanding for this type of evaluation).
