5.0

The LLM answer has the following significant errors and omissions when compared to the ground truth, all of which must substantially reduce its score:

**1. Missing Activities:**  
- The LLM answer misses two required activities: “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds.” The prompt explicitly asks not to merge, rename, or add activities – thus, these two essential workflow steps must be represented as matrix rows.

**2. Incorrect RACI Assignments:**  
- The “Risk Scoring” row incorrectly marks the Compliance Analyst as both Responsible and Accountable (“R, A”) whereas ground truth holds Compliance Analyst as Responsible and Compliance Officer as solely Accountable.
- The “KYC Review” and “AML Screening” rows show “R, A” for Compliance Analyst (good), but incorrectly put “C, I” for all other roles rather than the more specific designations (“C”, “I”, or “–”) required.
- “Intake Vetting” assigns “C, I” instead of just “C” or “I” as appropriate.
- The use of "A" (Accountable) for the Compliance Analyst on “Risk Scoring” is incorrect per ground truth, which makes Compliance Officer Accountable.

**3. Overly Broad Consulted/Informed:**  
- For every activity, the LLM answer gives "C, I" to all not-primary roles, which is both excessive and not in line with the activity-specific distinctions in the ground truth.

**4. Formatting Discrepancies:**  
- The LLM answer does not bold activity names as in the ground truth. While arguably minor, with strict grading, this is a formatting downgrade.

**5. Vocabulary Policy & Activity Names:**  
- The LLM answer does follow the restricted vocabulary and does not use any forbidden synonyms. However, it fails to generate all activities as mandated.

Given the severity of the missing activities (a fundamental process error) and the repeated inaccuracy of RACI role placements, penalties for each type of error combine to warrant a score no higher than 5.0. These deficiencies collectively prevent the answer from being reliable for process-governance documentation.
