3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, ~2/4 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses exactly the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks. No deductions here, but this is the only strong area.
- **Coverage of Activities (Major Failure, ~0.5/3 points)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** described in the narrative, which includes implied steps like escalation/approval and fund release (as explicitly broken out in ground truth). The LLM answer only includes the four mandated activities, omitting "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". This violates "do not ... add activities" indirectly by under-covering the process, leading to incomplete matrix. Strict deduction for not fully representing the narrative.
- **RACI Assignments (Significant Errors, ~0.5/2 points)**: Multiple inaccuracies compared to ground truth:
  - Intake Vetting: Adds unauthorized "C, I" for Compliance Analyst (should be "C" only), "C, I" for Compliance Officer (should be "–"), and "C, I" for Treasury Ops (should be "I").
  - KYC Review & AML Screening: Adds "C, I" for Front-Office Analyst (should be "–"); adds "I" to Compliance Officer (should be "C" only) and Treasury Ops (should be "I" only).
  - Risk Scoring: Adds "I" to Front-Office Analyst (should be "C" only) and Treasury Ops (should be "I" only); incorrectly assigns "A" to Compliance Analyst (should be "R" only).
  These are not minor; they inflate involvement (e.g., extra "C" and "I") and alter accountability, conflicting with RACI principles (e.g., dual "A" possible but mismatched here).
- **Formatting and Structure (Minor Errors, ~0.5/1 point)**: Markdown table is present, but lacks ground truth's bolding on activities/RACI cells, uses commas in cells (acceptable per key points for "R, A"), but no dashes ("–") for no involvement—instead fills with partial roles. No merging/renaming, but overall less precise.
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the missing activities alone warrant severe penalty (half the score floor), compounded by pervasive RACI mismatches (even small additions like extra "I" deduct heavily). No criminal/jailbreak issues, but output fails core task completeness and accuracy.
