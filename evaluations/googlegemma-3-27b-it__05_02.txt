The LLM answer proposes an entirely different modification (changing "Sign Contract" dueDate to P1D instead of "Collect Equipment" to P2D), resulting in a substantially different diff hunk, rationale that fails to address the implied 3-day SLA constraint effectively (reducing total estimated cycle from ~12D to ~10D vs. ground truth's ~9D, but neither matches the expected outcome), and no alignment with the ground truth's specific focus on the longest-delaying task without introducing activitiesâ€”constituting a complete mismatch warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
