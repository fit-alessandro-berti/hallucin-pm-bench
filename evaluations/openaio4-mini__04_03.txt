The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and provides a concise justification for each rule, accurately assessing satisfaction/violation without factual errors. It closely aligns with the ground truth in content and reasoning (e.g., Rule 3 violation due to NA before RA completion). Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing in Rule 3 (omits explicit reference to "both QE and RA") and lack of a summary statement or table format, though these do not match the prompt's "short justification" requirement exactly as in the ground truth.
