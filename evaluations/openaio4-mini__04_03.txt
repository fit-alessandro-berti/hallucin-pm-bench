The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall verdict ("No") and matches the ground truth reasoning for each rule, especially highlighting the violation of Rule 3 (NA happens before RA completes).

The main deviation from the ground truth is the brevity and lack of explicit tabular or elaborated structure. It does not mention that "NA must wait until both QE and RA are finished" (only says "before RA completes â€“ violated"), which is slightly less precise. The LLM answer could benefit from a better explanation for Rule 3 and should mirror the explicit format used in the ground truth.

Overall, the answer is factually accurate and appropriately strict, but slight deduction for less detailed justification and not quoting the rule text as closely as the expected answer.
