The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in content, correctly identifying the "No" verdict and the precise violation of Rule 3 while affirming satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4. Justifications reference each rule as required, with strong factual match on trace analysis (e.g., NA before RA completion). Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., not explicitly reiterating "both QE and RA" in Rule 3 phrasing) and format differences (bullets vs. table), which introduce subtle non-identical presentation under strict evaluation.
