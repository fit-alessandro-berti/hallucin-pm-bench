**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth across multiple dimensions, warranting the minimum score under utmost strictness:

- **Added unauthorized activities**: Includes "Schedule the payment (score ≤ 70)" and "Notify the originating analyst" (not in ground truth), violating "do not ... add activities." "Compliance Officer approval (score > 70)" and "Release the funds" mismatch ground truth names "**Compliance Officer Approval**" and "**Release Funds**" (renaming, added conditions/words).
- **Incorrect RACI assignments**: Nearly every cell differs. E.g.:
  | Activity | Key mismatches (LLM vs. ground truth) |
  |----------|--------------------------------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Front: **R** (not **R,A**); CompA: I (not C); CompO: I (not –) |
  | KYC Review | Front: I (not –); CompA: **R** (not **R,A**); CompO: I (not C) |
  | AML Screening | Same as KYC Review |
  | Risk Scoring | Front: I (not C); CompA: **R** (not R); CompO: I (not **A**) |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | Front: C (not I); CompA: **R** (not C); CompO: **A** (not **R,A**); Treas: I (not –) |
  | Release Funds | CompA: I (not C); CompO: I (not C); Treas: **R/A** (not **R,A**) |
- **Format errors**: No bolding on activity names (ground truth bolds all); **R/A** (no comma, slash instead of ", "); uses I universally instead of – for no involvement; no column alignment dashes; extra rows disrupt structure.
- **Vocabulary/strictness**: Four mandated terms correct, no leaks—sole positive—but overridden by additions/renames using "score" (echoes disallowed "risk rating" context) and incomplete coverage fidelity.

Even minor mismatches (e.g., comma in **R, A**, dashes) incur significant penalties per instructions; cumulative errors make this non-compliant.
