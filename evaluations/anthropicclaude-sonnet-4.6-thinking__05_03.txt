The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth, correctly adding an interrupting boundary timer event on `Activity_CreateAccount` with a `PT48H` duration and a sequence flow to the pre-existing `Activity_AMReview` without new activities, fully enforcing the SLA from the end of `Verify Identity`. It deducts minor points (0.5 total) strictly for cosmetic/textual differences: divergent element IDs/names (`Timer_CreateAccountSLA` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`; `Flow_09` vs. `Flow_LateEscalation`), unnecessary ID on `timerEventDefinition`, slightly more verbose justification phrasing despite being one sentence, and added Markdown headers/separators not present in ground truth. No semantic, validity, or compliance errors.
