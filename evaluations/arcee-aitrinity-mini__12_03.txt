**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and aligns perfectly with the ground truth in substance, structure, and adherence to the task:
- Correctly answers **No** (explicitly stated at the end, with the decision clearly framed from the start as "not accurate").
- Provides meticulous justification citing the **relevant CaseIDs** (C002, C004 as counterexamples; explicitly contrasts with C001, C003), with precise **activity sequences** and timestamps matching the log.
- Confirms the "always" claim fails due to intervening activities (Pack_Items in C002; Check_Fraud in C004), mirroring the ground truth's logic.
- No factual errors, hallucinations, or extraneous content; relies solely on the log.
- While the ground truth uses a table for exhaustive case-by-case breakdown, the LLM's narrative equivalently covers all cases (positives and negatives) and cites "relevant" ones per task instructions—format differences are stylistic, not substantive errors. Strict evaluation confirms zero deviations warranting point loss.
