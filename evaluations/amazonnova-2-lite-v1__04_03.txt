4.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correct elements (partial credit)**: Overall answer "No" is correct (+1.0). Rule 3 violation correctly identified with accurate reasoning (+1.5). Rule 4 correctly noted as satisfied in ordering (+1.0). Concise conclusion referencing violations.
- **Major errors (significant deductions)**: 
  - **Rule 1**: Incorrectly claimed **violated**; trace clearly has QE (position 3) **before** RA (position 5), satisfying "once each and in that order" (-2.0). Fabricated violation based on NA interleaving, which is irrelevant to Rule 1.
  - **Rule 2**: Incorrectly deemed "not applicable/cannot be satisfied" due to "prior violation"; VP (position 6) is **after** both QE and RA, satisfying it despite High severity (-1.5). Logical error in chaining to non-violation.
- **Minor issues**: Overly verbose format vs. ground truth's tabular clarity (-0.25). Unnecessary "moot/irrelevant" qualifiers for Rule 4 (-0.25). Small phrasing errors (e.g., VP "before QE properly ordered" is nonsensical).
- **Overall**: ~50% alignment on rule assessments (2/4 rules wrong, 1 partial); factual inaccuracies on core ordering undermine credibility. Strict penalty for errors in compliance auditing context.
