The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides accurate justifications, specifically citing case C003 (lines 6 and 7) and case C005 (lines 11 and 12), matching the key points of the ground truth. It also references case C002, but this is slightly imprecise: in C002, *Validate_Payment* (line 5) does follow *Receive_Order* (line 3), with only *Check_Inventory* (line 4) in betweenâ€”this does not contradict the claim as much as in C003 and C005. This extra, slightly inaccurate reference (C002) reduces the precision of the justification, resulting in a small deduction. All major counterexamples are correctly cited, and the answer is otherwise thorough and clear.
