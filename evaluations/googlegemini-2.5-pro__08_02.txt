**Score: 8.0**

**Justification:**

- The LLM answer correctly answers Q1 ("Yes") and gives a minimal firing sequence in Q2 that matches the ground truth (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5).
- The textual explanation is correct in logicâ€”T5 can fire before T3 by advancing through the alternative branch.

**Errors / Differences:**

1. **Notational detail**: The LLM answer gives the sequence as an inline list (**<T1, T2, T7, T4, T5>**) rather than a stepwise marking sequence. The ground truth is stepwise and uses markings for each step. This is a minor clarity and completeness issue.
2. **Explanation missing a key point**: The ground truth explicitly notes that after T5, T3 is disabled, while the LLM answer does not state this crucial property.
3. **Minor verbal imprecision**: The LLM says "This entire sequence completes without requiring T3 to fire," which implies but does not explicitly state that "T3 cannot be fired after T5." The ground truth is clearer and more precise about this property.
4. **Explanation redundancy**: The LLM needlessly elaborates ("the alternate path through T7 was used to produce the token needed for T4"), which is slightly verbose relative to the strict 120-word limit and effectiveness.

**Summary:**
The essential content and sequence are correct; however, lack of marking progression and missing the explicit mention of T3's subsequent disablement warrant a 2-point deduction for incomplete and slightly imprecise explanation.
