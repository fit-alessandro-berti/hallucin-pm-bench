The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering "Yes" for Q1 and providing the exact minimal sequence <T1, T2, T7, T4, T5> for Q2, matching the ground truth. The explanation correctly describes the parallel branches and how the P1-path enables P5 without firing T3, reaching {P2, P5} for T5. It stays under 120 words and aligns with the net's structure.

Minor deductions (-0.5): Lacks explicit intermediate markings (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}), which the ground truth includes for clarity, and omits the note on T5 disabling T3 post-firing, a confirmatory detail. No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes incomplete elaboration.
