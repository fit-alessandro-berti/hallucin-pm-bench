9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of tasks that execute concurrently in Process B and numbers them in order. It uses the labels "Parallel Split #1" and "Parallel Split #2" rather than the more descriptive phrasing of the ground truth ("first parallel block," "second parallel block"). Also, it includes the heading "sets of tasks that can execute concurrently," which aligns closely with the prompt and the ground truth. However, it does not explicitly state “No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel,” a detail present in the ground truth. The answer is factually complete, with only minor omissions in phrasing and completeness. Therefore, it deserves a high but not perfect score: 9.0.
