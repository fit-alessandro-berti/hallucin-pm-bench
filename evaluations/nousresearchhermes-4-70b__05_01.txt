The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation:

- **Timer placement**: Incorrectly attaches to Task_Check (post-Receive/Check, delaying the 48h clock from submission) instead of Task_Receive, violating SLA timing from "submission."
- **Event type and additions**: Introduces a confusing mix of timer boundary, Intermediate Signal Catch Event (new ID: Signal_ESC), and variable scripting—exceeding "only events/modify attributes/reconnect flows" by adding an extra event and logic not in ground truth's single interrupting boundary timer.
- **Duration**: Vague "24-36h" or "24h ±12h" (under 48h, imprecise) vs. exact PT48H; fails to ensure 48h from submission.
- **Mechanism**: Relies on auto-completing Task_RequestDocs and bypassing via signals/variables, which is overly complex and doesn't directly route to Task_Triage like ground truth's simple sequenceFlow bypass.
- **SLA compliance**: Doesn't guarantee reaching Triage within 48h of submission; potential for overrun due to late timer start.
- **Conciseness/clarity**: Exceeds plain English (numbered list, XML snippet, >120 words implied), introduces unrelated elements (e.g., execution.setVariable).

Minor intent to use timer for escalation earns partial credit, but errors compound to near-total mismatch.
