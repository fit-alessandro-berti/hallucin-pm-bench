The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in core content: correct "No" verdict, identical identification of counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 with Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order; C005 line 11 lacking Receive_Order), and adherence to one-paragraph justification citing cases/lines. Minor deductions for: (1) extraneous timestamps (not in ground truth or required, adding unneeded detail); (2) slightly less emphatic structure (inline prose vs. bulleted counterexamples with explicit "counter-examples" phrasing and concluding proof sentence); (3) "**No.**" formatting with period vs. ground truth "**No**" (small but strict stylistic mismatch). No factual errors, fully disproves the claim.
