1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on both questions, directly contradicting the ground truth by claiming "No" instead of "Yes" for Q1 and providing flawed reasoning that ignores the valid alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) which enables T5 to fire before T3 while consuming the P2 token. This is a complete reversal of the correct analysis, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
