The LLM answer is correct in terms of identifying which task pairs can run in parallel and does so accurately according to the process description. It also arranges each pair in alphabetical order within the pair, as required.

However, there are formatting issues:
- The answer omits the exact requested output formatting: extra spaces before and after the em-dash (`—`) are missing (it writes `Create_Documentation — Quality_Check`, but the ground truth is `"Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check"`, i.e., two spaces before and after the dash).
- The output does **not** use code formatting or the monospace block as shown in the ground truth.

Each of these errors, while minor, is specifically against the very strict criteria in the instructions ("Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points"), justifying a 2-point penalty.
