The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials with Schedule_Machines, and Create_Documentation with Quality_Check), orders them alphabetically both within pairs and overall, and uses the em dash format. However, it violates the strict output instructions by including lengthy introductory explanations, a numbered summary list, and bold formatting, instead of outputting *only* one pair per line without additional text. Minor formatting differences (e.g., lack of exact spacing alignment in the second pair as in ground truth, no code block) further deduct points under utmost strictness. The rationale in ground truth was not requested but aligns with the core content being accurate.
