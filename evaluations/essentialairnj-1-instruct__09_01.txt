**9.2**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be derived due to redacted timestamps/elapsed times, matching the ground truth's core conclusion and reasoning. It structures responses to match the numbered questions (1 and 2), provides a clear statement in (1), and explains the absence of data in (2) while noting irrelevance of benchmarks. Minor deductions for: slight verbosity/extra hypothetical formula/process (not in ground truth), use of "derived directly" (minor imprecision vs. ground truth's absolute "cannot be computed"), and lack of explicit mention of missing "ordering information" or fields list (-0.5 total). No fabrication, fully adheres to system policy.
