7.0

Rationale: The LLM answer's assessment for R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 matches the ground truth in both status and justification. However, there is a significant error for R2:

- For R2, the LLM incorrectly marks it as "Compliant", justifying this based on the interval after the first (initial) Finance_Approval. According to the rule, after a Change_Request, a new Manager_Approval is required, and Ship_Goods occurred before this new approval, thereby violating R2. This is a fundamental error in understanding the process, resulting in missing one of the key violations.

- The justifications for the other rules are clear and accurate, although brief.

- The overall result is correct ("NON-COMPLIANT").

Due to this significant but single (albeit important) error (incorrect judgment on R2) and strict grading per instruction, a deduction of 3 points is warranted, putting the score at 7.0.
