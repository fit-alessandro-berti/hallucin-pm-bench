4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant); justification accurate and concise (similar to ground truth). No deduction.
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. ground truth Violated) – major error, as LLM fails to account for Change_Request triggering a new final approval on 2025-03-07, making Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) non-compliant with the 2-day expedited window post-last approval. Justification ignores rule nuance, misapplying timeline. Significant deduction (-3.0 points equivalent).
- **R3**: Status correct (Violated); justification aligns well with ground truth timeline. Minor.
- **R4**: Status correct (Not Applicable); justification equivalent. No deduction.
- **R5**: Status correct (Violated); justification mostly aligns but inaccurately includes "Receive" as a subsequent step without new approval (Receive_Goods occurs *after* new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07 15:10). Minor inaccuracy (-0.5 points equivalent).
- **R6**: Status correct (Compliant); justification matches ground truth. No deduction.
- **Overall Result**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), though ground truth specifies violating rules (R2, R3, R5); LLM implies violations but doesn't list them explicitly. Minor format/omission.
- **Format & Constraints**: Adheres to required structure (status + ≤20-word justification per rule, all-caps overall). Word limits met. No major format issues.
- **Overall Assessment**: Strong on most rules, but the critical R2 error (misinterpreting change impact on expedited shipping) and minor R5 slip reflect incomplete rule analysis under strict evaluation, leading to a mid-low score. LLM demonstrates partial understanding but misses key interdependencies.
