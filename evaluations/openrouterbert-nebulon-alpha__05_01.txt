**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Major flaw (placement)**: Timer on `Task_Check` (post-`Task_Receive`) fails SLA—clock starts too late; delays in `Task_Receive` could exceed 48h from submission (`Start_Claim`). Ground truth correctly uses `Task_Receive`. (-4.0 points)
- **Major flaw (type)**: Non-interrupting creates parallel token, risking dual paths/duplicate triage without clean escalation or bypass of `GW_Docs`/`Task_RequestDocs`. Ground truth specifies interrupting for proper cancellation. (-2.0 points)
- **Minor**: No XML duration (`PT48H`), vague bypass ("completeness check" only), invents `f6a`. Ground truth precise on ID, duration, full bypass. (-1.0 point)
- Partial credit for timer concept, boundary event, direct to `Task_Triage`, no new tasks (+1.0). Total functional mismatch deducts heavily.
