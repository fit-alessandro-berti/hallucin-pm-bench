The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data:
- Q1: Exact match ("1").
- Q2: Exact match (5.56%; minor formatting variance in spacing irrelevant under strict log-based evaluation).
- Q3: Exact match (lists sole case "A1002"; phrasing as list complies precisely).
- Q4: Provides exactly two valid reasons matching ground truth categories ("temporal bias" via single-day coverage; "small sample size" with correct counts and variance explanation). Elaborations derive solely from log (e.g., date, 4 cases/18 events) without hallucination.
