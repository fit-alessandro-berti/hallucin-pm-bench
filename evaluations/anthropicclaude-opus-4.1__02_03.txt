- **Q1:** Matches ground truth in content and includes case names, but phrasing ("3 distinct cases") adds minor unnecessary wording compared to exact "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)". Slight deduction for not being verbatim concise.  
- **Q2:** Core answer "Pack_Items" is correct, but extra timestamp details violate "concise" instruction, creating a clear difference from ground truth's brevity. Significant deduction for added explanation.  
- **Q3:** Core answer "Cancel_Order" is correct, but extra clause ("only appears once...") deviates from ground truth's single-word response, again breaking conciseness. Significant deduction.  
- Overall: Factual accuracy is high, but strict evaluation penalizes all deviations from format and brevity, including the unrequested introductory sentence.
