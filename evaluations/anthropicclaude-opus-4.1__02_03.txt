9.5

- The LLM answer is correct and matches the ground truth in all substantive respects.
- Minor deduction: The LLM adds minimal extra wording and clarifies its reasoning for question 2 (“occurs at 09:35:00, Ship_Order at 09:40:00”), which, although strictly not required by the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction, doesn't alter the correctness or clarity but breaches the requested conciseness and bulleting slightly.
- Otherwise, all content and specific answers are correct and precise.
