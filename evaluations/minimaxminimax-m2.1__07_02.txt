**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high base score)**: Correctly identifies *exactly* the same changes—no misses or inventions. Uses precise XML IDs and BPMN element names (e.g., "exclusiveGateway" → "inclusiveGateway"). Headings match exactly ("Added tasks", etc.). Covers all required categories without fabricating changes.
- **Differences causing deductions (strict point loss)**:
  - **Formatting/structure (-0.5)**: Bullets vs. ground truth's numbered lists (1., 2., 3.). "##" headings vs. "* **" bold. Extra top-level title ("# BPMN Process Comparison Summary") vs. ground truth's "## **Expected Answer Key**".
  - **Content extras/interpretations (-0.8)**: Unnecessary descriptions (e.g., "New initial task after Start event", "replaced by a split path", detailed path summary in gateway). These add unrequested analysis beyond pure summary (e.g., flow counts/names like "three outgoing paths", "eligible"/"missing docs").
  - **Phrasing/precision (-0.3)**: Bolds IDs (**Task_VerifyIdentity**) vs. ground truth's task *names* (**Verify Identity** with ID in parens). Paraphrases task purposes (e.g., "handling missing documentation" vs. exact name "Request Additional Documents"; "ineligible cases" vs. "Final Reject"). Gateway misses explicit "in *v1* to *v2*" and semantic "(XOR)/(OR)".
  - **Conciseness (-0.2)**: Extra paragraph in gateway; no "(No other...)" disclaimer. Includes renamed labels (e.g., "Auto-Approve Loan") despite "ignore cosmetic renamings".
- **No major errors**: No incorrect facts, omissions, or violations of "ignore cosmetics/reorders". Deductions scaled for "small errors" per instructions, but core fidelity keeps it high (not <5.0). Exact match would be 10.0.
