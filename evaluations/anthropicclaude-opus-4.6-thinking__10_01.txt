**3.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Policy (STRICT)**: 10/10. All mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") used exactly; no forbidden terms. Perfect compliance.
- **RACI Matrix Correctness**: 1/10. 
  - 17/24 cells mismatch GT (e.g., Receive Application: CO "I" vs "C", FC/IT "–" vs "I"; KYC Review: AM "C" vs "A", CO "R/A" vs "R", FC/IT wrong; etc.). Extra "A" on primaries (GT separates R/A precisely); misses many "C"/"I" per narrative logic.
  - Violates "exactly one Responsible" interpretation (LLM bundles R/A incorrectly vs GT's split).
  - Bolded cells partially align but not precisely (GT targets exact **R** or **R/A**).
- **Formatting & Structure**: 2/10. Extra "#" column (unwarranted); role abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) vs full names; "–" vs explicit "I" where GT specifies involvement; different title/header.
- **Unwarranted Content**: 0/10. Entire "Assignment Rationale" section + "Key" legend added (GT has none; violates "no extra").
- **Overall**: Major deviations in core deliverable (matrix) outweigh vocab win. Strict penalty for errors/per GT diffs.
