The LLM answer captures the core idea of adding a boundary timer on `Task_Receive` with PT48H duration to enforce the 48-hour SLA by routing to `Task_Triage`, aligning with the ground truth's goal of bypassing delays without new tasks. However, it deducts points for inconsistencies (initial mention of an intermediate timer after `Start_Claim`, which contradicts the final suggestion), unnecessary additions (conditional logic for "bypass" and "avoid duplication," not in ground truth; false claim of "reusing an existing escalation path"), lack of precision (omits "interrupting" type, timer ID, and exact XML-like `<bpmn:timeDuration>`), and minor narrative fluff, introducing small but significant deviations under strict evaluation. Word count is compliant (~90 words).
