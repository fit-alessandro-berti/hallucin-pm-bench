### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct identifications (partial credit)**: Accurately spots added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway change (`gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). Uses exact XML element IDs and names. Matches ground truth content core (+2.0 base).
- **Major deductions for speculation and extras (-3.5)**: Adds forbidden interpretive phrases like "inserted between...", "replacing the former RMA Label step", "removed from the approval path; superseded by..." — direct violation of "Do **not** speculate" and "list **only** the factual differences". Also adds unrequired gateway name ("Warranty Valid?").
- **Format violations (-1.8)**: 
  - Unrequired "## Change Summary" header.
  - Headings use "###" markdown instead of exact "• Added tasks" style or ground truth "**Added tasks**".
  - List items use "-" with bold/extra dashes vs ground truth "* Name (id = `id`)".
  - ID format: (`check_vip`) vs precise "(id = `check_vip`)".
- **Strictness applied**: Even minor extras (e.g., positions inferable but not "only factual") and format mismatches cause outsized loss per instructions. No "(none)" needed, but no credit for unmentioned diffs like flow ID changes (correctly ignored). Overall ~60% fidelity to ground truth structure/content.
