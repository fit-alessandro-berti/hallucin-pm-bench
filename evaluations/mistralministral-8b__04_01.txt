The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant but fails critically in several ways compared to the ground truth:

- It only addresses rule 3 (one of two violations) and completely misses the violation of rule 2 (reversed order of `Ship_Goods` at event 8 and `Risk_Assessment` at event 9 after `Expedite_Flag`).
- The justification for rule 3 misinterprets "distance â‰¤ 2" as temporal (17 minutes) rather than sequential (activity positions: event 10 is distance 3 from event 6, correctly noted in ground truth but not by LLM).
- It lacks the comprehensive rule-by-rule analysis in the ground truth, omitting checks for rules 1, 4, and 5 (all satisfied).
- The format is partially aligned (starts with "Non-compliant" and a justification) but is incomplete and inaccurate, warranting significant deduction under strict criteria.
