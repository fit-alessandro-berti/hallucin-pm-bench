The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant and accurately cites the violation of Rule 2, but it fails to evaluate all rules as required for a complete justification. It omits the violation of Rule 3 (Three_way_match at event 10 exceeds the distance â‰¤2 from Goods_Received at event 6), does not address Rules 1, 4, or 5, and lacks the structured, exhaustive format of the ground truth. This incomplete analysis represents a significant error under strict evaluation criteria, warranting a score below a passing threshold despite the correct overall verdict.
