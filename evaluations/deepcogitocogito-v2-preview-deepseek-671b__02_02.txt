The LLM answer is factually precise and aligns closely with the ground truth across all questions. Q1 matches exactly (3 distinct cases). Q2's sequence is identical in content and format (using â†’ separators). Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors alphabetically, one per line, matching the required output (minor formatting differences like italics vs. bullets do not impact factual accuracy). No hallucinations, omissions, or errors; extra reasoning does not detract from the core answers.
