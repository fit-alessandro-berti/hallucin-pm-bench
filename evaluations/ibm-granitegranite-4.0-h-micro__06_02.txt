The LLM answer identifies only one of the three parallel blocks (P1), omitting P2 and P3 entirely, which constitutes a major incompleteness and failure to enumerate "every set." It also uses "||" separators instead of the required commas, violating the specified output format. These errors result in substantial deviation from the ground truth, warranting a low score despite partial correctness on the first block.
