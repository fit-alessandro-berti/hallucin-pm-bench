6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, numbers)**: Fully accurate. The three worst activities by average waiting time are correctly identified (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), and both avg and 95th-percentile times are quoted verbatim from the table. No forbidden topics (e.g., service time, throughput, other activities) are discussed. (+3.0 points)
- **Memo Structure and Constraints**: The core content is concise (<150 words), but the response includes unnecessary pre-memo reasoning and step-by-step analysis, violating the direct "Draft the memo now" instruction. The memo header (To/From/Subject) adds extraneous formality not present in the ground truth, bloating the response beyond a "crisp executive memo." (-1.5 points)
- **Actions**: Concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues, but not sufficiently data-driven. The ground truth explicitly justifies ≥20% reductions with pseudo-evidence (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%", "estimated 30%"). The LLM actions lack any such supporting data or quantification in the memo itself (mentions ≥20% only in internal thinking, not the output), making them generic rather than data-driven. Small but strict deduction for this core requirement miss. (-1.0 point)

Total: Strong on facts (8.5 base), but penalized heavily for format/extras and action specificity (net -2.0).
