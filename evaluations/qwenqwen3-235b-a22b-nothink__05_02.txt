The LLM answer proposes an entirely incorrect modification by extending a due date (worsening potential SLA compliance) on the wrong task, fabricates a reversal it doesn't implement, miscalculates cumulative impacts without reference to the implied 3-day SLA, and uses incomplete unified diff formatting (missing @@ hunk markers), resulting in zero alignment with the ground truth solution and rationale.
