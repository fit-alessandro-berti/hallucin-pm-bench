The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in JSON structure (e.g., "process" wrapper, "nodes" vs. "elements", extraneous "id" in flows, differing node properties like "eventType" vs. "event"), node IDs and names (e.g., "parse-email" combining steps not matching "createTicket"; "Support Email Received" vs. "Email Received"; "Ticket Complexity" vs. "Simple or Complex?"), element types (boundary event attached to undefined "subprocess" vs. intermediate catch), and especially flow modeling (parallel split/join misplaced after "send-response" instead of before, leading to invalid BPMN with dangling tokens on timer path at "parallel-join", unlike ground truth's consistent synchronization at "joinAfterLogging" before "awaitReply"). Conditions differ in capitalization ("Simple"/"Complex" vs. "simple"/"complex"). The timer lacks duration ("PT24H" vs. none, but structured differently). Cancel handling is poorly integrated in both, but LLM's attachment error adds invalidity. Core parallelism and wait integration differ semantically, violating faithful translation. No hallucinations of escalations, but cumulative structural, naming, and logical flow errors warrant severe deduction under strict criteria.
