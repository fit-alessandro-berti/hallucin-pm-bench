The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides an accurate one-paragraph justification citing the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 with Validate_Payment before Receive_Order; C005 lines 11-12 with Validate_Payment but no Receive_Order), matching the ground truth's core facts and citations precisely. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., flowing paragraph vs. bulleted list; inclusion of unnecessary but factually correct details like timestamps, other cases following the sequence, and "variability"), which introduce slight verbosity not present in the more concise ground truth, per strict evaluation criteria. No factual errors.
