3.0

- The LLM answer places a **non-interrupting boundary timer** on the wrong activity (**Activity_VerifyID**), when the SLA should be on **Create Account in Core System** for "48 hours after Verify Identity completes".
- The correct timer **must be attached to Activity_CreateAccount** (not Activity_VerifyID), because the SLA is about how long Create Account may take, not how long after Verify Identity ends before it starts.
- The answer sets `<cancelActivity="false">` (non-interrupting timer). The ground truth uses `cancelActivity="true"` (interrupting), which is correct, because the SLA breach should interrupt/abort the "Create Account" task to escalate.
- The timer duration in the LLM answer is `P2DT0H0M` (ISO 8601), but the ground truth uses `PT48H` (also ISO 8601), which is clearer; the LLM answer omits xsi:type on the timer duration.
- The LLM answer correctly routes the escalation flow to **Activity_AMReview** (good), and includes a (non-required but acceptable) condition expression `true`, while ground truth omits it.
- The justification is partially correct, but incorrectly describes that the timer is on "Verify Identity", not on "Create Account", which makes it an invalid enforcement point.

**Major Problems:**
- **Wrong attachment point** (activity): Severe error.
- **Wrong timer type** (non-interrupting, not interrupting): Severe error.
- Slight issues in timer expression and XML attributes.
- Justification text misstates the mechanism.

**Conclusion:**  
Due to incorrect placement of the boundary event, wrong timer type, and justification referring to the wrong activity, this answer only deserves a **3.0**. It demonstrates partial understanding but would not achieve the documented business requirement if implemented.
