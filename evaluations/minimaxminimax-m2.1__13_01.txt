9.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Q1 (9.0/10)**: Correct count ("1"), but adds extraneous verifiable details (case/time) beyond ground truth's minimal "`1` occurrence". Strict deduction for deviation from exact minimalism.
- **Q2 (10.0/10)**: Exact match on "5.56%" value, calculation shown, rounding precise. Minor formatting diff (no space before %) is trivial but noted.
- **Q3 (10.0/10)**: Functionally identical to ground truth ("Only case **A1002**"), clear listing of identifier.
- **Q4 (9.5/10)**: Provides exactly two clear, sampling-related reasons matching ground truth options ("Small sample size", "Temporal bias"). Elaborations (e.g., "weekends, holidays") are reasonable hypotheticals for unreliability without inferring unlisted events, but slight over-elaboration vs. ground truth's concise phrasing deducts marginally.
- **Overall (9.5/10)**: Near-perfect fidelity to log data, no hallucinations, answers all questions directly. Minor phrasing/excess detail differences prevent full 10; utmost strictness applied for any non-identical elements.
