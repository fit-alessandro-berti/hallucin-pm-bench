**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it states **No** for Q1 (violating ground truth **Yes**), misinterprets "T5 fire before T3" as requiring both transitions to occur (question does not specify), and provides an irrelevant explanation about mutual exclusivity despite citing the exact demonstrating sequence (T1,T2,T7,T4,T5). No credit for partial insight, as core yes/no and Q2 are wrong; strict evaluation demands perfection on key facts.
