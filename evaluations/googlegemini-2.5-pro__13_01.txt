**Score: 9.0**

**Evaluation:**

1. **Question 1:** Correct: "1 time." — fully matches ground truth.
2. **Question 2:** Correct: "5.56%" calculated as 1/18, rounded to two decimals — fully matches ground truth.
3. **Question 3:** Correct: "A1002" — fully matches ground truth, uses precise case identifier.
4. **Question 4:**  
   - The answer gives "Insufficient Sample Size" and "Unrepresentative Time Period" (i.e., covers only a 5-hour window).  
   - "Insufficient Sample Size" is equivalent to "Small sample size" from the ground truth.
   - "Unrepresentative Time Period" overlaps with "Temporal bias".
   - The explanation is clear and correct on both points.

**Minor Error:**  
- While precise, the second bullet for question 4 ("Unrepresentative Time Period") is slightly less explicit than "temporal bias" referencing "morning of 1 May 2025". Though the LLM does mention "5-hour window on a single day," it does not specify "morning," but this is not a significant omission and context is clear.
- No unjustified inferences or hallucinations.

**Note:**  
- The formatting for question 2 (no space before "%") is slightly different from ground truth ("5.56%"), but this is a minimal error.
- The response does not mention other sampling reasons (case-mix bias, survivorship bias), but only two were requested.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is complete, precise, and tightly adheres to ground-truth, with only a negligible minor detail lost (not naming the time window as "morning" exactly). This warrants a robust score of **9.0**, with one point deducted for ultra-strictness requested.
