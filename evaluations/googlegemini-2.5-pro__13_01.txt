The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the data constraints for all four questions. Question 1 is identical. Question 2 matches the calculation and result precisely. Question 3 conveys the same information with equivalent detail. Question 4 provides two clear, valid reasons that directly align with accepted ground truth options (small sample size and temporal bias), without hallucination or unjustified inference. No errors or deviations are present.
