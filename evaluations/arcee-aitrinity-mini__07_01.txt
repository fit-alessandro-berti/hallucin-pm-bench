The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, gateway type from exclusive to inclusive), uses the exact required headings, and sticks strictly to only those categories with no speculation or extras. However, under utmost strictness:
- Tasks list only `id` values instead of matching ground truth's full `name` attribute values + `(id = ``id``)` format (e.g., "check_vip" vs. "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)" ), which are both factual but not matching detail/presentation.
- No bullet points (`*`), markdown bolding (`**`), or version labels (`(v1)`/`(v2)`).
- Gateway change lacks the specific `gw_valid` id reference.
These are multiple small-but-significant format/content detail mismatches to the ground truth, warranting deduction from perfect (no other errors like wrong items or extras).
