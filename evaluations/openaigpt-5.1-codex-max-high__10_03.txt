**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly uses all four mandated terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks. Headers match roles precisely. Attempts to cover narrative activities.
- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **Added unauthorized activities** (violates "do not ... add activities"): Includes "Schedule payment" and "Notify originating analyst" (absent in ground truth); splits "Release funds" separately from implied scheduling. Ground truth has exactly 6 activities; LLM has 8 (+33% extra rows).
  - **RACI assignments differ in nearly every cell** (80%+ mismatch rate):
    | Activity (aligned where possible) | Key Mismatches |
    |-----------------------------------|---------------|
    | Intake Vetting                   | CA: I vs C; CO/TO: empty vs –/I |
    | KYC Review                       | FO: C vs –; CO/TO: empty vs C/I |
    | AML Screening                    | CO/TO: empty vs C/I |
    | Risk Scoring                     | FO: empty vs C; CA: R/A vs R; CO: I vs **A** |
    | Compliance Officer approval      | TO: I vs – (name casing minor but inconsistent) |
    | Release funds                    | CA: empty vs C; CO: I vs C |
    | (Extras: Schedule payment, Notify) | Entire rows fabricated/not in GT |
  - **Formatting violations** (strict loss): Uses "R/A" slash (not "**R, A**"); empty cells (not "–"); no bolding on activities/**R,A**; inconsistent casing/spacing (e.g., "approval" vs "Approval", "Release funds" vs "Release Funds"); no *Key points* notes.
- **Overall**: ~70% structural/content deviation from ground truth. Vocabulary compliance prevents 1.0 floor, but strictness demands heavy penalty for additions, RACI errors, and format. Small mismatches (e.g., I vs C, empty vs –) each deduct ~0.5-1.0 points cumulatively.
