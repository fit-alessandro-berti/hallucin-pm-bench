9.2
- Q1 matches core fact (3 cases) but lacks explicit listing of cases (C123, C456, C789), uses "distinct" (minor extra per prompt but deviates from exact phrasing), no **A1:** label.
- Q2 exact match ignoring escaping (Pack_Items vs Pack\_Items).
- Q3 exact match.
- Overall format lacks bold/labels (**A1:** etc.) despite concise bullets as prompted; strict deduction for non-identical structure/content (0.8 total loss).
