**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" and leverages the T2b shortcut to enable T5 without prior T3 firing, with accurate marking evolution up to T5 (nice table). However, under strict comparison to ground truth:

- **Major error in firing sequence**: Provides T1/T2b/T4/T5 (length 4), claiming "shortest", but omits T6/T3 required to actually fire T3 *after* T5, failing to demonstrate the full "T5 before T3" ordering (ground truth uses length-6 sequence 〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉 as minimal for both transitions). Explicitly states "T3 ... need not fire", contradicting ground truth's emphasis on post-T5 firing via feedback.
- **Wrong minimality**: Claims 4 is shortest without proof or consideration of T3; ground truth proves ≥6 with lower bound analysis.
- **Explanation differences**: Focuses on bypassing T3 permanently vs. ground truth's "why this works" (shortcut + feedback re-enables T3 after T5). Extra "formal explanation" section unneeded (prompt specifies explanation *only if no*).
- **Structural diffs**: Headers, table vs. inline markings/steps; verbose vs. concise proof.

Core insight matches (T2b enables early T5), but sequence/explanation fundamentally diverge from ground truth, warranting major deduction per strict criteria.
