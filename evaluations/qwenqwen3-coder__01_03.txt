6.5

The LLM's answer is mostly accurate, but notable discrepancies and missing details mean a significant deduction is warranted:

---
**a) Decision points:**

- The first decision point ("Conditional Skip of Manual Underwriting") is described correctly and matches the process/specification, although the LLM omits the crucial *otherwise it proceeds* wording (the fallback is only implied, not explicit).

- The second point ("TriVote Decision Gate") is accurate and matches the description in the process and the Ground Truth.

However, the LLM does not mention explicitly that BOTH conditions in the first decision are conjunctive ("and"), though it is shown in the rule. There is also minor ambiguity in the naming ("Conditional Skip...") compared to the more precise, process-aligned "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check."

---
**b) Documents**

- The LLM correctly lists the right documents in nearly the correct order according to process steps.
- **Major miss:** The LLM omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77", which is specifically listed as a required document at the "Request-Applicant-Confirmation" step in both the process description and the Ground Truth.
- The LLM includes the three Scorecards as separate documents, which matches the process, although the Ground Truth leaves it ambiguous whether the "Scorecard" is a single set. Listing them separately (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) is correct.
- All other listed documents match the Ground Truth in sequence.

---
**Summary of Point Deductions:**

- -1.0: Omitting Signed Offer Sheet 77 (which is an explicit, required document).
- -0.5: Minor wording ambiguity in part (a) around the completeness of the conditional branch.
- -1.0: Soft on process languageâ€”less precise heading/phrasing for each decision point than the Ground Truth.
- -1.0: Did not point out that "any mention of KYC... would indicate a hallucination," as shown in the Ground Truth footnote.

**Total: 10 - 1.0 - 0.5 - 1.0 - 1.0 = 6.5**
