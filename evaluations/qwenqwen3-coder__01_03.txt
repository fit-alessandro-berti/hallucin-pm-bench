7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM correctly identifies both decision points and summarizes their rules in one sentence each, closely aligning with the ground truth in content and structure. Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly stating the alternative path ("otherwise it proceeds to that review") in the first rule, which is present in the ground truth; (2) phrasing differences like "minimum of two out of three approvals ... to pass this gate" vs. ground truth's "at least two ... record 'Approve'" and "loan may advance only when," which slightly alter precision without changing meaning. No extra or missed points. Score: 8.5/10.
- **Part (b)**: The list is mostly accurate in sequence for the first five and final items, with no hallucinations (e.g., no improper additions like KYC/AML). However, significant errors: (1) Omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (explicitly listed separately in the process at step 8 and in ground truth as item 7); (2) Places "ID Matrix Declaration" immediately after "Offer Sheet 77" (item 7 in LLM vs. item 8 in ground truth), disrupting the first-appearance order since both appear together at step 8, with the signed version preceding or concurrent. This results in an incomplete list (8 items vs. 9 in ground truth) and incorrect ordering. Score: 6.0/10.
- **Overall**: Weighted average, with stricter penalty for the substantive omission and ordering issue in (b), which directly violates the "all documents ... in the order they first appear" requirement. The response is structured and professional but not fully faithful.
