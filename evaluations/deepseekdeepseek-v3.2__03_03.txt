**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Grading Breakdown)
Using utmost strictness, grading prioritizes **exact match to ground truth XML structure, elements, attributes, names, and semantics** per the instructions. Semantically equivalent (same logic/flow despite minor ID/whitespace diffs) would be 10.0; any deviation deducts significantly, with extra/hallucinated elements or omissions costing 1.0+ points each. Total deductions lead to 5.0.

**Major Deductions (High Impact, -4.5 total):**
- **Extra hallucinated task (`wrc_check_warranty_eligibility`)**: Required by prompt semantics, but absent in ground truth flow (direct `complete_gw` → `warranty_gw`). Adds task + flows (`wrc_flow3_complete` → check → `wrc_flow6`), altering structure/semantics vs GT. (-1.5)
- **Extra hallucinated event (`wrc_wait_for_info` intermediateCatchEvent + messageEventDefinition)**: Models "waits" explicitly, but prompt says **model only explicitly mentioned flow elements; do not invent**. GT uses direct loop (`request_info` → `validate`). Adds event + flows (`wrc_flow4`, `wrc_flow5`). Violation of "no invention". (-1.5)
- **Extra DI section (`bpmndi:BPMNDiagram` + 18 shapes)**: GT is minimal (no DI). Adds ~80 lines of unrequired layout, bloating XML beyond self-contained process. (-1.5)

**Moderate Deductions (Structural/Element Mismatches, -2.5 total):**
- **Task types**: All 8 tasks as `<userTask>` vs GT `<task>`. Different BPMN elements (userTask subtypes task but changes XML). (-1.0)
- **Gateway/flows modeling**: `gatewayDirection` attributes, `<conditionExpression>` (e.g., `claim_complete`) vs GT `name="Yes"/"No"` on flows. Extra attributes alter XML. (-0.75)
- **ID schemes**: Longer/verbose (e.g., `wrc_validate_claim` vs `wrc_validate`; `wrc_flow3_complete` vs `wrc_sf3`). Allowed variation but excessive vs minimal GT. (-0.5)
- **Process/definitions**: Different `id` (`wrc_WarrantyReplacement` vs `wrc_process`), fuller namespaces/targetNamespace, no `bpmn:` prefix. (-0.25)

**Minor Deductions (Names/Verbatim, -1.0 total, but significant per strictness):**
- **Task names not verbatim** (prompt requires **verbatim** bolded text): 
  - `validate the claim` vs "**validates the claim**" (tense/case).
  - `request missing information` vs "**requests missing information**" (tense/case).
  - `check warranty eligibility` vs "**checks warranty eligibility**" (tense).
  - Case diffs (e.g., `update inventory records` lower vs GT `Update...`). GT similar issues, but diffs count. (-0.75)
- **Missing names**: No gateway names (`Claim complete?`, `Within warranty?`), flow labels (`Yes`/`No`), end names (`Successful end`/`Rejected`). (-0.25)

**Strengths (No Deduction, Baseline ~13.0 before cuts)**:
- Core gateways exact (2 exclusive, parallel split/join).
- 2 end events.
- All IDs prefixed `wrc_`.
- Parallel flows correct.
- 15 sequence flows (matches count).
- Start name matches GT/prompt intent.
- Verbatim matches on 4/8 tasks (`Create shipment order`, etc.).

Overall: LLM captures prompt logic *better* than GT (includes required check task + proper wait), but **excessive differences/extra inventions** (per rubric/GT comparison) yield mid-low score. Equivalent minimal XML without extras/DI/userTask/catch would be 9.0+.
