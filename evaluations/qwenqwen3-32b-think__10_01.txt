3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Compliance (Weight: High, -2.0 deduction)**: The matrix correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" without forbidden terms *within the matrix*. However, the added "Terminology Compliance" section explicitly mentions the forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing"), violating the strict policy against mentioning them even in quotes. This is a direct infraction.
  
- **RACI Allocations (Weight: Highest, -4.0 deduction)**: Major differences from ground truth, failing to reflect the narrative accurately. Key issues:
  - Each activity has exactly one "R" (matches ground truth criterion), but "A" is misplaced (e.g., assigned to the "R" party unnecessarily, like CO R/A for KYC Review vs. ground truth CO R with AM A; FC R/A for Payment Clearance vs. FC R with AM A; IT R/A for Record Update vs. IT R only).
  - Multiple "C" (Consulted) roles are downgraded to "I" (Informed), misrepresenting involvement (e.g., CO C → I for Receive Application and Order Vetting; FC C → I for KYC Review and Record Update; AM C → I and FC C → I for Record Update; CO C → I for Payment Clearance).
  - No activity fully matches: 5/6 rows have 2–3 cell errors. This deviates significantly from the ground truth and narrative (e.g., AM should be "A" for KYC Review and Payment Clearance but is "I"; FC consulted for KYC but "I").

- **Structure and Formatting (Weight: Medium, -0.5 deduction)**: Basic matrix format is present (activities as rows, roles as columns), with no extra tasks/roles/columns. However, minor inconsistencies like comma-separated R/A vs. ground truth's slash (R / A), inconsistent bolding, and full role names vs. abbreviations in headers. The added "Key" section is redundant but not severely unwarranted.

- **Unwarranted Content (Weight: Medium, -0.5 deduction)**: The "Key" explains RACI (unnecessary, as standard) and "Terminology Compliance" introduces extra explanatory text not requested, including the vocab violation noted above. No extra tasks/roles, but this bloats the response beyond "produce a RACI matrix."

- **Overall Alignment (Weight: High)**: Captures core process steps and roles but fails on precise RACI per narrative/ground truth. Partial credit for correct synonyms in matrix and one "R" per row, but strict rubric demands near-exact match—differences are substantive, not minor.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deductions yield 3.0. The response is functional but riddled with errors that undermine accuracy and policy adherence.
