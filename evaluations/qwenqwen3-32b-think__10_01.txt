7.0

- **Vocabulary:** The LLM answer strictly adheres to the required terminology rules, using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance", and avoiding all forbidden terms. No deduction there.
- **Format:** Acceptable. The matrix is formatted as requested, with correct activities and roles.
- **RACI Assignments:**
  - **Receive Application:**  
    - LLM: AM (R,A), others (I)  
    - Ground Truth: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I)  
    - **Deduction:** LLM misses that CO should be Consulted (C).
  - **KYC Review:**  
    - LLM: CO (R,A), others (I)  
    - Ground Truth: CO (R), AM (A), FC (C), IT (I)  
    - **Deduction:** LLM merges A and R to CO; FC should be C, AM should be A, not I.
  - **Order Vetting:**  
    - LLM: AM (R,A), others (I)  
    - Ground Truth: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC/IT (I)  
    - **Deduction:** LLM misses CO as C.
  - **Payment Clearance:**  
    - LLM: FC (R,A), others (I)  
    - Ground Truth: FC (R), AM (A), CO (C), IT (I)  
    - **Deduction:** AM should be A; CO is C, LLM omits these.
  - **Record Update:**  
    - LLM: IT (R,A), others (I)  
    - Ground Truth: IT (R), AM/FC (C), CO (I)  
    - **Deduction:** CO is I not I, but AM/FC should be C, not I.
  - **Notify Customer:**  
    - Both agree: AM (R/A), others (I).

- **Key:** Correct and clearly stated.

**Summary of Issues:**  
- Across almost all activities, LLM omits "Consulted" and "Accountable" for certain roles, over-simplifying RACI assignments. These are significant process mapping inaccuracies. The "A" is either incorrectly assigned or missing compared to the ground truth. The pattern of omitting "C" for CO and FC, and not distinguishing "R" and "A" correctly for AM and FC, recurs throughout.

**Conclusion:**  
The vocabulary and structure are solid, but the RACI allocation is imprecise and repeatedly oversimplifies/collapses roles, which, per prompt and rubric, is a major fault. Thus, a **7.0** reflects good vocabulary and format, significant but not complete accuracy in RACIâ€”greater deductions are not appropriate only because all required activities/roles/forbidden content handling is otherwise correct.
