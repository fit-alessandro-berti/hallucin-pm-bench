**2.0**

### Strict Evaluation Breakdown (key differences leading to low score):
- **Columns/Roles (major violation, -3.0)**: LLM uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support (3 columns). Ground Truth (GT) includes Operations Manager (4 columns). Missing role is a critical omission.
- **Number/Structure of Tasks (major violation, -2.0)**: LLM has 8 rows with extras (e.g., #6 Send SWIFT message, #7 Archive case file, #8 Receive notification of case archive—splitting/adding beyond source). GT has exactly 6 concise rows mapping source steps without extras/omissions.
- **Task Wording (major violation, -1.5)**: LLM uses verbose/non-mandated phrasings (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction", "Screen payment against sanctions list"). GT uses precise, mandated-style titles (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "**KYC Review**" bolded). LLM adds unsubstantiated details.
- **RACI Assignments (major violation, -1.0)**: Near-total mismatch per row:
  | LLM Row | Key LLM | GT Equivalent | Mismatch |
  |---------|---------|---------------|----------|
  | 1 | TA:R, IT:I | TA:R, RL:I, OM:A, IT:C | Missing GT roles/assignments |
  | 2 | TA:R, RL:C | TA:R, RL:A, OM:I, IT:C | RL C vs A |
  | 3 | TA:C, RL:R | TA:C, RL:R, OM:A, IT:I | Missing OM:A, IT:I |
  | 4 | TA:I, RL:A | TA:C, RL:R, OM:A, IT:I | Multiple shifts (e.g., TA I vs C, RL A vs R) |
  | 5 | TA:R, RL:I, IT:C | TA:R, RL:I, OM:A, IT:C | Missing OM:A |
  | 6 | IT:R (new) | N/A (omitted) | Extraneous |
  | GT Release | - | Matches partially but lacks OM |
  | GT Archive | LLM #7 partial | TA/RL/OM/IT differ (LLM I/C vs GT C/I/A/R) |
- **Formatting/Clarity (minor but strict deduction, -0.5)**: No legend (GT has it). No "(mandated wording)" header note. Uneven Markdown (e.g., empty cells inconsistent).
- **Vocabulary Compliance (partial credit, no deduction)**: Uses "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison" correctly (matches mandate/GT), but doesn't elevate to perfection due to other failures.

Total deductions exceed 8.0 from 10.0 base; LLM covers basics loosely but deviates fundamentally from GT structure, mappings, and precision. Unfit for "senior consultant" documentation.
