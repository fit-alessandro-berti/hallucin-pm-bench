The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides accurate justification by citing the two counterexample cases (C002 and C004) with their relevant sequences, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns with the task requirements and the log evidence. However, it loses a full point for being less comprehensive than the ground truth, which systematically evaluates all four cases in a structured table (including the compliant ones, C001 and C003), providing a more exhaustive case-by-case analysis without adding errors or omissions. Under strict evaluation, this difference in thoroughness reflects a minor but notable gap in depth, though the core logic and cited evidence remain fully accurate and sufficient for disproof.
