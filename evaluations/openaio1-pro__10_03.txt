### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Added unauthorized activities**: The LLM introduces "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst" as separate rows, violating the prompt's explicit instruction to "do not ... add activities." It also treats "Release Funds" separately but expands the process beyond what's strictly described without merging or omitting as in the ground truth. The ground truth limits to six activities (the four mandated ones plus "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"), omitting "Schedule Payment" and "Notify" as distinct. This alone is a major structural error, as it expands the matrix incorrectly.

- **RACI assignment inaccuracies**: Nearly every cell differs from the ground truth, even for overlapping activities. Examples:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM assigns only Front-Office Analyst as R/A (correct for that role but uses "/" notation vs. ground truth's "R, A"); misses Compliance Analyst (C) and Treasury Ops (I). Ground truth: Front-Office **R, A**, Compliance C, Treasury I.
  - **KYC Review**: LLM incorrectly adds Front-Office I (should be –); Compliance Analyst R only (should be **R, A**); Compliance Officer A (should be C); misses Treasury I.
  - **AML Screening**: Same errors as KYC Review (Front I vs. –, Compliance R vs. **R, A**, Officer A vs. C, misses Treasury I).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front I vs. C; Compliance R (correct) but misses **A** nuance; misses Treasury I.
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Front – vs. I; others mostly align (Compliance C, Officer **R, A**), but minor notation difference (R/A vs. **R, A**).
  - **Release Funds**: Front – vs. I; Compliance – vs. C; Officer I vs. C; Treasury R/A (notation minor issue vs. **R, A**).

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: No bolding of activity names or R/A designations as in ground truth (e.g., **Intake Vetting**, **R, A**). Uses "-" instead of "–" for no involvement, which is a minor but noticeable deviation. R/A shorthand is not exactly matching "R, A".

- **Vocabulary compliance**: The four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) are used correctly without synonyms, aligning with the policy. No leaks of disallowed terms. However, this single strength does not offset the pervasive errors elsewhere.

- **Overall coverage**: The matrix covers all roles but inflates activities, leading to incomplete fidelity to the process narrative. It infers/escalates details (e.g., splitting scheduling/release/notification) not precisely mirrored in the ground truth, resulting in ~70% mismatch across cells for shared rows and invalid extras.

Small errors (e.g., notation, missed "C/I" involvements) compound to significant losses, as even partial alignments in core activities are undermined by additions and omissions. A perfect match would require exact activities, RACI, and formatting; this is far from it.
