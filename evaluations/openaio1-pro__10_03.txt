4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates effort to use only the authorized vocabulary, and avoids unauthorized synonyms. However, there are multiple significant deviations from the ground truth answer which, according to your instructions, should result in a substantial deduction:

**Major issues:**

1. The LLM answer introduces non-existent activities:  
   - "Schedule Payment"  
   - "Notify Originating Analyst"  
   These activities were not specified in the ground truth and are not allowed; no such step appears in the definitive process sequence.

2. The LLM answer omits a required activity:  
   - "Release Funds" is present, but the LLM adds extra activities instead of limiting its matrix to only the required actions.

3. Assignment errors:  
   - The RACI assignments deviate frequently and materially:
      - For "Intake Vetting", the ground truth has Front-Office Analyst as R, A, but the LLM has R/A and omits C for Compliance Analyst and I for Treasury Ops.
      - For "KYC Review", the LLM marks Compliance Officer as A, which is incorrect; ground truth gives R, A to Compliance Analyst, C to Compliance Officer, I to Treasury Ops.
      - "AML Screening" and "Risk Scoring" have similar assignment mismatches.
      - "Compliance Officer Approval": the LLM gives C to Compliance Analyst and R/A to Compliance Officer, and I to Compliance Officer for "Schedule Payment" and "Release Funds", none of which reflects the ground truth exactly.
      - The ground truth uses I (Informed) and C (Consulted); the LLM inconsistently applies these.

4. Formatting and vocabulary:
   - The mandated activity vocabulary is followed.
   - The assignment formatting ("R/A" instead of "R, A") is not an error with meaning, though it does differ stylistically from the ground truth.

**Summary:**
- The LLM does NOT include unauthorized synonyms (GOOD).
- The LLM includes the required terms (GOOD).
- The LLM invents extra activities (BAD, major infraction).
- The RACI assignments diverge significantly from ground truth (BAD).
- RACI on some activities is materially misapplied, showing misunderstanding of process flow.
- Does not merge or rename activities, which is correct.

Given these substantial faults—especially inventing/rewording activities and incorrect assignments—a strict score is warranted. I assign **4.0**.
