**3.0**

Major differences from ground truth: 
- Timer attached to wrong task (`Task_RequestDocs` vs `Task_Receive`), which fails to monitor from submission (common prefix) and only covers incomplete-docs branch starting late.
- Imprecise timer duration (`PT48H` adjusted to e.g. `PT47H`) vs exact `PT48H`.
- Added markdown header/formatting not in ground truth's plain English.
- No XML `<bpmn:timeDuration>` syntax.
- Minor: different timer ID, hacky "absorb prior time" rationale.

Conceptually similar (interrupting boundary timer + flow to `Task_Triage`), but core placement error critically undermines SLA enforcement, warranting severe deduction under strict criteria.
