**9.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match (1). Full points.
- **Q2a**: Exact match (2.08%, with correct calculation shown). Full points. Minor formatting (no space before % vs. ground truth) ignored as negligible.
- **Q2b**: Exact match (8.33%, with correct calculation). Full points. Minor symbol (≈ vs. ÷) ignored.
- **Q3**: Strong but not perfect. Meets all required elements: (i) single-occurrence (explicitly "1/48", rare/outlier); (ii) variance/instability ("skew metrics", "biases", "poor performance"); (iii) over-generalisation ("if generalized from this slice"). Under 100 words (~68). Deduction (-0.8) for slightly off-focus (emphasizes model underweighting/overlooking vs. ground truth's precise n=1 statistical noise/skew/CI collapse) and minor inaccuracy ("outlier" imprecise; rare events "skew metrics if ignored" flips causality slightly).

Overall: Numerics perfect; explanation 90% aligned under strict criteria (significant deduction for nuance differences).
