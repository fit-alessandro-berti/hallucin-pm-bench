4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, focusing on fidelity to content, structure, terminology, and completeness as per the prompt. The prompt requires summarizing **decision points** (using exact activity names, no standard terminology) and listing **every required document**. Even minor deviations (e.g., additions, omissions, rephrasing, or structural differences) result in significant point deductions under the strict criteria.

#### Key Differences in Decision Points (Major Issues, ~50% Deduction):
- **Extra/Invalid Inclusion**: The LLM incorrectly adds **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** as the first decision point, inventing a "Decision: Acceptable ID card and mobile phone confirmed? If not, the process cannot proceed." The ground truth omits this entirely, as KYC is a preliminary verification step (step 2 in the process), not a core "decision point" like the gating mechanisms. This introduces unsubstantiated content and deviates from the ground truth's focus on three explicit gates (Underwriter Alignment, Amount Threshold, MBA). Penalty: Severe, as it alters the summary's scope and adds inferred details not in the process description or ground truth.
- **Structural and Sequencing Mismatches**: 
  - LLM combines **Dual Underwriter Split** and **Underwriter Alignment Gate** into one point but describes the split's actions (score assignments) before the gate's decision, without specifying it's "after the Dual Underwriter Split" as in ground truth. It also explicitly says "proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)", which is accurate but more verbose than ground truth's concise "*If ... ⇒ continue*".
  - **Amount Threshold Decision**: LLM correctly describes it but omits the ground truth's precise positioning ("after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). It adds "(no Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA))", which is implied but not in ground truth's phrasing.
  - **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: LLM expands with outcomes ("If approve, proceed to Disburse Funds. If reject, funds are not disbursed"), while ground truth keeps it minimal ("the board votes Approve or Reject"). This over-explains, deviating from the summary style.
- **Count and Formatting**: LLM lists 4 points (with sub-bullets and bolding), vs. ground truth's 3 concise, numbered points with arrows (⇒) for flows. LLM's title uses "**Micro-loan Fast-Track** process (using the exact activity names)", adding unnecessary parentheticals not in ground truth's simple "#### Decision points".
- Overall: LLM's version is longer and interpretive, while ground truth is a tight summary of only the branching decisions. This makes it less faithful.

#### Key Differences in Required Documents (Minor Issues, ~10% Deduction):
- **List Completeness**: Both list the exact 6 documents from the prompt, with no additions or omissions. Good match.
- **Wording and Precision**:
  - LLM uses fuller phrasing from the prompt (e.g., "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)", "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)", "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template"), which is more precise.
  - Ground truth abbreviates slightly (e.g., "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months)", "Latest Income Statement (pay-stub/tax slip)", "Community Impact Statement (CIS)"), losing minor details like "old", "single ... or", and "template". LLM is actually closer to the source, but since we're grading against ground truth, these rephrasings count as small differences.
- **Extra Content**: Ground truth adds a note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), reinforcing the prompt's "no standard loan terminology" but not requested. LLM omits this, sticking strictly to the list—neutral, but it highlights ground truth's emphasis on exclusions.
- **Formatting**: LLM numbers and bolds the list under a dashed separator; ground truth uses a subheader and simple numbering. Minor stylistic deviation.

#### Overall Assessment:
- Strengths: Documents are nearly identical (high fidelity). Uses exact terminology (e.g., no standard loan terms introduced). Covers core decision points without fabrication beyond KYC.
- Weaknesses: The decision points section has substantive errors (extra point, verbosity, incomplete sequencing), making it diverge significantly from ground truth's concise, 3-point structure. This violates the "summarise" intent and strict adherence. No major criminal/offensive issues, but evaluation is content-focused.
- Score Calculation: Base 10.0 minus 5.0 for decision points deviations (extra content/structure ~50% impact) minus 0.5 for minor document wording/formatting mismatches. Result: 4.5 (failing strict criteria due to additions and mismatches).
