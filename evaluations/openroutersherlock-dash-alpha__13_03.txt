6.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Exact match (both state "1"). Full points here—no deductions.
- **Question 2**: Partial alignment but notable differences under strict scrutiny. Both emphasize small sample size (3 cases, ~1.5–2 hours) and risks of extrapolation/sampling error, staying under 120 words and data-grounded. However:
  - LLM omits critical ground truth elements: exact timestamp (09:07:13), event-level frequency swing (0% to 7% via 1/14 events), wide confidence intervals, rare-event sampling volatility, and especially the near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) causing string/fuzzy matching distortions—directly observable in data, making this a major omission (significant point loss).
  - LLM introduces per-case 33% rate and specific "overestimation" bias (with unmentioned daily/seasonal variations/triggers, bordering on speculation), while ground truth stresses bidirectional misestimation and reliability needs. Minor: LLM's time estimate (~1.5h) vs. ground truth (<2h); no timestamp.
  
Overall, ~65% fidelity: Strong on core sampling but misses data-specific nuances, justifying deduction from perfect score.
