8.0

The LLM answer lists exactly the correct pairs, but it omits the spacing in the second pair ("Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" vs. the required "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"). This small but real formatting inaccuracy reflects a lack of full fidelity to instructions and must result in a notable deduction for strictness. The answer is otherwise content-accurate and in the right order, so a grade of 8.0 is appropriate.
