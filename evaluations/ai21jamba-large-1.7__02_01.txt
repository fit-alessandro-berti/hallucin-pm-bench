7.0

The LLM answer is close but not perfect. Detailed evaluation:

- Q1: Correct (3) → Full credit.
- Q2: Correct ("Pack_Items") → Full credit.
- Q3: Correct ("2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00") → Full credit.
- Q4: Correct (2) → Full credit.
- Q5: Incorrect. The LLM answer includes "Quality_Check", but in case C-77, "Quality_Check" is the first activity. According to the ground truth, only "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", and "Ship_Order" should be listed. Adding “Quality_Check” is a factual error.

As requested, even small errors impact the grade; the Q5 error involves misreading which activities can be the first event—a significant but not catastrophic mistake. This warrants a deduction of 3 points, so 7.0.
