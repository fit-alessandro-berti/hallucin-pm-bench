The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1–Q4, demonstrating precise extraction of distinct cases (3), preceding activity for Ship_Order in A-9321 (Pack_Items), earliest timestamp (2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00), and count of Quality_Check occurrences (2). However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list of activities that never appear as the first event, as it does appear as the first (and only) event for case C-77. This factual error in the list, while including the three correct items, violates the strict requirement for accuracy and results in a significant deduction (equivalent to ~20–25% loss, reflecting the importance of complete precision in process-mining analysis).
