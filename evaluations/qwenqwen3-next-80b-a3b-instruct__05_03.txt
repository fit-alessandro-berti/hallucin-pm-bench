The LLM answer partially addresses the SLA enforcement but makes significant errors compared to the ground truth:

- The LLM correctly adds an interrupting boundary timer at “Activity_CreateAccount” with a 48-hour duration, which is appropriate.
- However, the LLM’s boundary event is missing some details:
  - No `name` attribute for the boundary event.
  - The `<bpmn:timeDuration>` does not use the `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` required for complete BPMN 2.0 compliance (present in ground truth).
- The most critical issue: The LLM routes the timeout **directly to the “End_Rejected” event** instead of the existing “Account-Manager Review” (`Activity_AMReview`) task. This violates the instruction to use existing escalation paths/activities where possible, and disregards the explicit business intent to leverage the already present escalation user task.
- The justification sentence also misleads: it claims compliance is handled “without adding new activities,” but the key difference is NOT rejecting onboarding outright, but first escalating to the escalation review step that is already part of the process.

Due to the functional error in escalation path, minor XML attribute/typing omissions, and inaccurate justification, this answer deserves a substantial penalty, but partial credit is awarded for the appropriate timer and boundary-event approach.
