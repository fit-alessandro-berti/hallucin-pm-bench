4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Part (a) - Decision Points (8.5/10):**  
Identifies the exact two decision points correctly. Descriptions are accurate and concise, capturing the rules in one sentence each (conditional skip for step 5; TriVote requiring 2/3 approvals). Minor deductions for: slightly less precise naming ("Step 4 Conditional Branch" vs. ground truth's "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"); "€250,000 or less" vs. "≤ €250 000" (formatting/notation difference); "formally approve it" vs. "record 'Approve.'" (less specific wording). These are small but incur significant loss per instructions.

**Part (b) - Documents List (0.5/10):**  
Catastrophic failures:  
- **Incomplete:** Lists only 5 items vs. ground truth's 9. Misses **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** (explicit process inputs in step 3, first-appearance order positions 2–4) and **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (explicitly listed separately in step 8, position 7).  
- **Wrong order:** Places Deck Memo as #2 (ignores step 3 scorecards preceding it).  
- **Extra/poor formatting:** Unnecessary notes (e.g., "*only created if...*") not in ground truth; mentions "signed Offer Sheet" in note but fails to list as distinct item.  
These are major omissions and structural errors, not small—directly violating "ALL documents... in the order they first appear."

**Overall:** Strong (a) pulled up by weak (b); no hallucinations (good), but differences are substantial. Strict weighting yields 4.0 total.
