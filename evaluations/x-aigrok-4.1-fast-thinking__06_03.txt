The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order, with matching task names and no extraneous information about other processes, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements. However, under utmost strictness:  
- Lacks descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**").  
- Uses plain comma separation instead of "‖" parallel symbol.  
- Omits backticks around task names and bold formatting.  
- Misses the confirmatory final sentence ("No other tasks...").  
These formatting and stylistic differences, though minor, deduct 1.5 points per the strict evaluation criteria emphasizing even small variances.
