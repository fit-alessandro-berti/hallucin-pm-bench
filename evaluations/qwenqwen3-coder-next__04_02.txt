**4.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Statuses**: 5/6 correct (R2–R6 match; **R1 wrongly "Violated" vs. ground truth "Compliant"**—trace clearly shows Manager_Approval #2 before Finance_Approval #3, direct factual error deducting -3.0 points).
- **Justifications**:
  - R1: Completely incorrect and reversed facts (>20 words? ~16, but irrelevant due to error; -1.0).
  - R2: Status correct, but justification flawed (claims "1 day after 03-04 approval" as baseline then blames R5 "too early"; ground truth ties to "final approval 07-Mar >2 days"; ~38 words exceeds limit; -0.5).
  - R3: Matches closely (~12 words; minor phrasing diff; -0.1).
  - R4: Matches (~5 words; 0).
  - R5: Similar but ~28 words exceeds limit, less precise than ground truth; -0.3.
  - R6: Matches (~5 words; 0).
- **Format**: List format acceptable (prompt doesn't mandate table); bolding partial; word limits violated in R2/R5 (-0.4 total).
- **Overall**: Correct "NON-COMPLIANT" (+0.5 partial credit).
- **Total**: Major R1 error dominates; minor issues compound under "utmost strictness" (-5.8 from 10.0 base = 4.2).
