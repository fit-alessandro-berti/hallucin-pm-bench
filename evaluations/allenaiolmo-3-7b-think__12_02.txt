6.5

The LLM answer correctly starts with "No" and identifies the key counterexample in C003 (VP precedes RO at lines 6-7), accurately citing lines and contradicting the claim. However, it loses significant points for a factual error and misinterpretation in the C002 analysis: VP at line 5 *does* follow RO at line 3 (even if not immediately), so claiming it violates "follows" (not "directly follows") is incorrect and introduces an invalid counterexample. It also completely omits the C005 counterexample (VP at line 11 with no prior RO), which the ground truth highlights as a clear violation of "always follows." These omissions and errors make the justification incomplete and partially flawed compared to the precise, error-free ground truth, warranting a mid-range score under strict evaluation.
