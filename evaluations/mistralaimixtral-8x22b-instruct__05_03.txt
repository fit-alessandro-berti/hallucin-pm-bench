**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major XML syntax error (-4.0)**: `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>` is incorrectly nested *inside* `<bpmn:boundaryEvent>`, making the snippet invalid BPMN XML (sequenceFlows must be direct children of `<bpmn:process>`; ground truth correctly places it separately).
- **Critical functional omission (-2.0)**: Missing `cancelActivity="true"` (boundary event defaults to non-interrupting, failing to halt "Create Account" on timeout, thus not enforcing SLA; ground truth explicitly includes it).
- **Schema inaccuracy (-1.0)**: `xsi:type="bpmn:tExpression"` is redundant/wrong for `timeDuration` (should be `tFormalExpression` per BPMN best practice and ground truth).
- **Minor deviations (-0.5 each, total -1.0)**: No `name` attribute on boundaryEvent; extra introductory text violates "return **only** the changed/added XML..."; justification omits "interrupting" and bolding/formatting matching ground truth.
- **Partial credit (+1.0)**: Correctly identifies boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount`, uses `PT48H`, routes to existing `Activity_AMReview`, and provides a one-sentence justification with right intent.

Overall, the answer is functionally broken, syntactically invalid, and deviates significantly from ground truth despite sharing the core idea.
