The LLM correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials with Schedule_Machines, and Create_Documentation with Quality_Check), ignores Process A, and applies alphabetical ordering correctly both within each pair (e.g., Create_Documentation before Quality_Check due to 'C' < 'Q'; Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines due to 'P' < 'S') and overall (Create_Documentation pair first due to 'C' < 'P'). No extraneous pairs are included, matching the ground truth substance and rationale.

However, significant deductions for:
- **Output format violation**: The response is a verbose, rambling monologue (~2000+ words) with repetitive internal reasoning, rather than a clean list of pairs (one per line, no extra text). The prompt specifies a concise output using the exact format, but the pairs are buried amid explanations, violating "Output one pair per line".
- **Spacing inconsistencies**: The ground truth uses two spaces around "— " (e.g., "Task_X  —  Task_Y" with alignment in the second line via extra spaces for columnar look). The LLM uses single spaces (e.g., "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check"), which is a small but noticeable formatting error under strict evaluation.
- **No code block or clean separation**: Ground truth uses a markdown code block for the output; LLM's is plain text embedded in prose.

These errors (especially the extraneous content) prevent a perfect match, warranting a major point loss despite substantive accuracy.
