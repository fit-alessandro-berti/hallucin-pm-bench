7.0

**Justification:**

- **Pair Identification (correct):** The LLM correctly identifies the *only two* valid task pairs in Process B that can run in parallel:  
  - Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines  
  - Create_Documentation — Quality_Check

- **Pair Ordering (correct):** The LLM, after much internal reasoning and checking, ultimately outputs the two pairs in the correct required order:
  - Create_Documentation — Quality_Check  
  - Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

- **Pair Output Format (mostly correct):** The answer uses the requested format, with a single pair per line, and with tasks in each pair placed in alphabetical order.

**Penalties:**  
- **Formatting Minor Error:** The answer uses a single space around the em dash (—), but the ground truth shows **two spaces** on either side. The prompt explicitly requests the format:  
  `Task_X  —  Task_Y`  
  (with two spaces both before and after the em dash).  
  The model consistently uses only one space on each side, i.e.:  
  `Create_Documentation — Quality_Check`  
  instead of  
  `Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check`  
  This is a **consistent, small formatting error** per the prompt's "utmost strictness" policy.

- **Excessive Verbiage:** The detailed explanation (showing internal reasoning, ASCII value checking, etc.) far exceeds the required output as per the prompt, which requests *only* the formatted list of pairs (one per line). The instruction is clear to "output one pair per line, using the format...," which means all the interim reasoning should be omitted from the output.

**Summary:**  
The logic is entirely correct, all valid pairs are included, no spurious pairs are added, and both the pair and overall ordering match requirements. However, the format is **slightly wrong** (one instead of two spaces), and the answer is **excessively verbose**, including internal reasoning which should have been omitted per output instructions. Under strict grading, these two issues merit a **3 point deduction**.

**Final Score:** **7.0**
