9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) (Decision points)**: Identifies exactly the two decision points with accurate one-sentence descriptions matching the process rules. Minor deductions for: (1) lack of bolded descriptive titles (e.g., "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"); (2) non-identical phrasing (e.g., "skip ... otherwise, proceed to step 5" vs. "bypasses ... proceeds to that review"; "passes if ... approvals from any two" vs. "advance only when at least two ... record 'Approve.'"); (3) "requested loan amount" vs. "requested amount"; (4) bullets instead of numbered list; (5) incorrect currency notation (€250,000 with comma vs. €250 000). Content is correct and complete (no extras/misses).
- **Part b) (Documents)**: Perfect match on all 9 documents in exact first-appearance order; no hallucinations. Minor deductions for: (1) bullets instead of numbered list; (2) title "Documents (in order of first appearance)" vs. "Required documents (first-appearance order)".
- **Overall**: Extremely close to ground truth in substance (100% accurate/complete), but strict formatting/phrasing/notation differences warrant deduction from 10.0. No major errors or omissions.
