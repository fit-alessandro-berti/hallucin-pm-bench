**4.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict line-by-line factual precision vs. ground truth):
- **Q1/A1**: Exact match ("3"). Perfect. (10/10)
- **Q2/A2**: Major discrepancies and hallucination by omission. Ground truth: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" (4 activities, correct chronological order from log lines 2,5,8,10). LLM misses "Receive_Order" entirely (line 2), starts incorrectly with "Check_Stock", lists only 3 activities in wrong sequence. Also fabricates "(Check_Stock)" in Q2 header (not in prompt). Critical error. (0/10)
- **Q3/A3**: Content matches exactly (distinct predecessors: "Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"; alphabetically ordered, one per line). Minor formatting diff (no "-" or "<br>"), but prompt specifies "one per line, alphabetically ordered" — semantics identical. (10/10)

**Overall**: 20/30 = ~6.7 raw average, penalized to 4.0 for utmost strictness on Q2 hallucination/omission (significant factual loss, as any missing/extra = hallucination per ground truth note). Two-thirds correct, but Q2 failure is disqualifying under strict criteria.
