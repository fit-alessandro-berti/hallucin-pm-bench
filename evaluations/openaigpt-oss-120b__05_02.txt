The LLM answer matches the ground truth diff exactly in content (minor formatting variance in diff markers is negligible), correctly identifies and modifies the same attribute for the single proposed improvement without violating rules. However, the rationale loses points for strictness due to differences: it omits the specific "3-day SLA" reference, the phrase "without introducing any new activities" (directly tying to task constraints), uses interpretive terms like "bottleneck" not in ground truth, and rephrases the task reference ("equipment-collection taskâ€™s" vs. "**Collect Equipment**") without bolding or precise naming, introducing small but notable deviations in precision and alignment.
