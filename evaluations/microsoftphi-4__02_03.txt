9.5

- The LLM answer is clear, concise, and essentially aligns with the expected ground truth.
- It lists all three questions in bullet-point form.
- For question 1, the LLM lists the cases explicitly with a bit more detail than the ground truth, but is correct.
- For question 2, it correctly identifies "Pack_Items" as the immediately preceding activity for "Ship_Order" in case "C456".
- For question 3, it correctly identifies "Cancel_Order" as the activity appearing exactly once.

Minor deductions:
- The format uses a short introduction for each bullet ("There are...", etc.) instead of just listing the answer concisely (e.g. "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"; "Pack_Items"; "Cancel_Order"). This adds verbosity and does not fully match the expected concise bullet list, per instruction.
- There is slight inconsistency in formatting compared to the ground truth (“There are 3 distinct cases: ...” vs just “3 cases (...)" etc.)

These are very minor issues, but as per the instruction to be strict and penalize even small differences, a 0.5 point deduction is applied.

Final Score: **9.5**
