The LLM answer is substantively correct and aligns closely with the ground truth on all content points (distinct cases, preceding activity, and unique activity). It uses bullet points as required for conciseness. Minor deductions for slight formatting differences: restating full questions (less concise than ground truth's A1/A2/A3 labels) and adding unnecessary quotes around activity names, which introduces small presentational variances from the expected style.
