**Evaluation:**

1. **Question 1:** The LLM says “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs 1 time. (Correct; matches ground truth.)
2. **Question 2:** The LLM states “5.56%” and gives the correct calculation. (Correct; matches ground truth.)
3. **Question 3:** The LLM lists “A1002” as the only case. (Correct; matches ground truth.)
4. **Question 4:**  
   - **First reason:** LLM gives “Limited Timeframe,” noting the data covers only a single day (2025-05-01). The ground truth prefers the specific phrase “temporal bias” and notes the log is from “morning of 1 May 2025.” The LLM slightly overreaches by asserting “only a single day”—while all the timestamps are indeed from 2025-05-01, the ground truth cautions not to assume the fragment covers the whole day, since only explicit events matter.  
   - **Second reason:** LLM gives “Small Sample Size” with the reason well-explained (matches ground truth).  
   - **Minor issue:** The “Limited Timeframe” explanation subtly assumes the data span the whole day. Strictly, per instructions, the answer should stick to what is said in the log lines (i.e., the time range is only from 09:00 to 14:05). Because of “utmost strictness,” this is an (albeit small) extrapolation.

**Overall:**  
- Precision and structure are correct, with calculations and caselists accurate.
- There is a modest and VERY minor overstatement in the “limited timeframe” description.
- No hallucinated facts, but an opportunity for tighter phrasing to match the fragment’s actual visible range.

**Deduction:** -0.8 for a small drift from strictly data-shown details in part 4.

**Final Score:** 9.2
