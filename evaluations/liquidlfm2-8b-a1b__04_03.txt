The LLM correctly identifies non-compliance ("No"), earning minimal credit. However, the justification is fundamentally flawed and deviates severely from the ground truth: it incorrectly focuses on invented issues like "missing internal validation or completion tracking" for Rules 1 and 2 (both of which are satisfied per the trace sequence), while completely ignoring the actual violation of Rule 3 (NA before RA) and failing to assess Rule 4. This misattributes the non-compliance, omits the table-structured reasoning format, and introduces extraneous non-rule-based concerns, resulting in near-total mismatch and strict deduction for inaccuracy.
