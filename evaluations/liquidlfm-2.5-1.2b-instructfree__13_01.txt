**4.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict scoring, 2.5 points max per question):
1. **Perfect match** (exact count, adheres to data): 2.5/2.5  
2. **Perfect match** (correct calc, format, rounding): 2.5/2.5  
3. **Major hallucination** (lists nonexistent A1004 event, invents 2nd case not in log): 0/2.5  
4. **Partial credit** (1st reason valid but generic; 2nd "order of events" irrelevant/vague, not data-tied like temporal/case-mix bias): 1.0/2.5  

**Total: 6.0/10 → adjusted to 4.0 for strictness on hallucination (policy violation: infers absent events) and weak Q4 specificity.**
