**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst-performing based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times. Accurately quantifies SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s) matching data and GT. Sticks to table data without invention (unlike GT's fabricated "€25k", "April 2025", "4 805 cases", "35% reduction"). Uses bullets exclusively for recommendations. Approximate word count (~170) close to 150. Proper memo structure with To/From/Subject.
- **Major failures (heavy deductions)**: Recommendations are vague/generic ("reduce waiting time", "target waiting time") vs. GT's concrete actions (e.g., "add one risk analyst"); not matching and lacking data-driven specificity. Analysis in prose paragraph vs. GT's bolded list format with explicit "throughput X s vs. Y s SLA (+Z s)". Missing GT elements: total cases, projection/impact, precise phrasing ("materially breach... largest queues"), bolding, "s" spacing. Headers differ (From, Subject). Selective case mentions inconsistent. Strict policy demands significant loss for these differences in content, structure, and completeness. Overall similarity ~40%.
