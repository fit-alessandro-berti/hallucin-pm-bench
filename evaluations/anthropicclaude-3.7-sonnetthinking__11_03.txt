7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth's selection. Core quantifications of SLA excesses (+300s for Legal and Risk, +60s for Credit) align precisely, and waiting times are accurately referenced (600s, 480s, 200s). Structure follows memo format with bullet-point recommendations only for actions, and content is grounded in table data without absent activities or metrics.

However, under strict evaluation, deductions apply for:
- **Extra derived metrics (significant loss: -1.0)**: Percentages (e.g., 100% over, 80% of total) and case volume details (e.g., "480 of 1175") are calculable but not "provided" in the table, violating the "no metrics not provided" rule and differing from ground truth's simpler, direct reporting.
- **Header and phrasing differences (moderate loss: -0.5)**: Minor variations in "From" (Senior Analyst vs. Process Performance Office), subject line, and introductory wording (e.g., "breaching SLAs due to excessive waiting times" vs. "materially breach... largest queues") introduce unnecessary divergence.
- **Recommendations mismatch (major loss: -1.0)**: Actions are concrete and data-driven (tied to wait times) but substantively different from ground truth (e.g., LLM's "fast-track assessment" vs. ground truth's "add one risk analyst and automate scores"; no mention of specifics like "low-risk bypass" or "loans under â‚¬25k"). This represents a core content deviation.
- **Absence of conclusion (minor loss: -0.0)**: Ground truth includes a projected impact (35% reduction), which LLM omits; however, this is an addition in ground truth not required by the prompt, so no penalty.

Word count (~140) approximates 150, and no inventions beyond derivations. Overall similarity is high in structure and key facts (70-80% overlap), but strictness on differences yields 7.5.
