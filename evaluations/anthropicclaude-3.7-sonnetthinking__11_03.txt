6.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities: Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment, and quantifies SLA breaches and waiting times with accurate values.
- The calculation of amounts exceeding SLA and waiting times is consistent with the table.
- The recommendations are largely reasonable and data-driven, but less precise than the ground truth (e.g., “implement dedicated fast-track assessment for low/medium-risk applications” vs. “add one risk analyst [...] and automate external score retrieval”; or “introduce automated pre-screening” vs. the specific “straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k”).
- Minor fabricated context: The statement “Only 480 of 1175 credit-assessed applications proceed to this stage” is an inferred calculation not strictly grounded or requested by the prompt.
- The calculation “Legal Approval exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (50% over target)” is mathematically off (900-600=300, 300/600=50%), but it’s a minor issue; ground truth did not cite the over-target percentage.
- No references in the dataset to “credit-assessed applications,” “dedicated fast-track,” or parallel processing explicitly.
- The LLM answer does not mention the projected 35% cycle time reduction or restoring SLA compliance, which, while not explicitly required, is in the ground truth.
- Formatting differences: The memo subject lines differ, but both are acceptable; however, the ground truth is more professional and data-driven in wording.
- The ground truth is also more rigorous, such as specifying the sample size (“4 805 completed cases”).

Overall, the LLM answer is generally correct in structure and the main factual points, but the small extrapolations, vaguer recommendations, and lack of extra quantification/details merit a significant points deduction per the grading rules.
