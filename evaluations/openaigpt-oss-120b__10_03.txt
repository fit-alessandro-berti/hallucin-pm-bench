3.0

The LLM answer demonstrates solid adherence to the vocabulary policy, correctly using the mandated terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) and not introducing any forbidden synonyms. Formatting as a Markdown table is also correct.

However, the answer is significantly incomplete and partially inaccurate when measured against the ground truth:

**Major Issues:**
- The answer omits two activities present in the ground truth: **Compliance Officer Approval** and **Release Funds**. This is a serious omission, as the prompt explicitly forbids renaming, merging, or removing activities and requires coverage of every activity described.
- For activities that appear, the RACI assignments do not always align with the ground truth:
    - For **Intake Vetting**, it sets the Front-Office Analyst as R/A (correct), but then inaccurately marks all others as “I” (Informed), rather than matching "C, – , I" as in the ground truth.
    - For **Risk Scoring**, it gives Compliance Analyst as R/A, but in the ground truth, Compliance Analyst is only Responsible, and Compliance Officer is Accountable.
    - For all activities, “C” (Consulted) and “–” (not involved) are misapplied or missing compared to the ground truth.

**Other Issues:**
- Only four activities are listed, whereas the narrative clearly gives six distinct activities.
- “R/A” is rendered as “R/A” in all instances, which is acceptable, but in the ground truth, some activities delegate “R” and “A” to different people (not combined).

**Positives:**
- No disallowed synonyms or phrasings leak into the table.
- Output is a Markdown table, as requested.

**Scoring Justification:**
- Because two full activities are missing and role assignment for the activities is frequently incorrect, this is a major loss of points.
- Minor losses for role assignment misalignment and missing notations (such as “–”) are present.
- Correct vocabulary and formatting prevent the score from dropping into the 1–2 range.

Overall: The answer displays some core understanding, but its incompleteness and RACI misalignments mandate a low score.
