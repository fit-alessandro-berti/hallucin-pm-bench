The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using only the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. However, it fails significantly in other areas under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Incomplete coverage of activities**: The prompt requires a matrix "covering every activity... described above" without adding, but the narrative implies six distinct activities (the four core ones plus escalation/Compliance Officer Approval and fund release/notification by Treasury Ops). The LLM only includes four rows, omitting two critical ones present in the ground truth (Compliance Officer Approval and Release Funds). This is a major structural error, representing ~33% missing content.

- **Incorrect RACI assignments**: Multiple cells deviate from the ground truth, treating minor differences (e.g., I vs. –, I vs. C, C vs. A) as substantive errors per strictness rules:
  - Intake Vetting: Compliance Analyst (I vs. C), Compliance Officer (I vs. –).
  - KYC Review: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. –), Compliance Officer (I vs. C).
  - AML Screening: Same errors as KYC Review.
  - Risk Scoring: Front-Office Analyst (I vs. C), Compliance Analyst (R/A vs. R), Compliance Officer (C vs. A).
  This affects 8+ cells, with no involvement for escalation/release unaddressed.

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses **R/A** shorthand instead of **R, A**; lacks dashes (–) for no involvement; activities not bolded; minor table header differences (e.g., en-dash in role names). These are small but deduct points per instructions.

- **No merging/renaming**: Compliant here, but overall incompleteness and errors outweigh this.

The output is partially correct on vocabulary and format but fundamentally flawed in completeness and accuracy, warranting a low score.
