### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (strong adherence, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere, including in any explanatory text. This fully complies with the strict vocabulary policy.
  
- **Structure and Format (partial, +1.5 points)**: The response produces a clear RACI matrix with activities as rows and roles as columns (AM, CO, FC, IT). All six activities from the process description are included without extras. The ASCII table is legible and functional, though it differs from the ground truth's Markdown format (minor deduction for inconsistency). The inclusion of a legend is helpful but unwarranted (adds explanatory content not in the ground truth). Uses "-" for blanks, which implies "no involvement" but fails to specify where ground truth assigns C or I.

- **RACI Allocations (major errors, -3.8 points)**: Significant deviations from the ground truth, violating the rubric's correctness criteria. Each activity must have exactly one Responsible (LLM complies here), and Account Manager (AM) must be Accountable where appropriate (LLM fails this repeatedly, assigning A only to direct performers instead of AM as owner).
  - **Receive Application**: CO (C → -), FC (I → -). Missing consultations/information flows.
  - **KYC Review**: AM (A → I), CO (R → R/A, unwarranted dual role), FC (C → -). Shifts accountability incorrectly; ignores AM's oversight role.
  - **Order Vetting**: FC (I → -). Minor but strict deduction for omitted involvement.
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM (A → I), CO (C → I), FC (R → R/A). Accountability misplaced to FC; downgrades consultation to mere information.
  - **Record Update**: AM (C → I), CO (I → -), FC (C → -), IT (R → R/A). Multiple omissions; changes consultation to information or nothing; unwarranted IT dual role.
  - **Notify Customer**: CO (I → -), FC (I → -). Omits key information assignments.
  - Overall: ~12/24 cells mismatch (50% error rate). LLM is overly minimalistic, inferring only direct handlers from the narrative while ignoring implied broader involvements (e.g., CO/FC consultations). Small errors (e.g., R/A vs. R; I vs. C) compound into systemic inaccuracies, reflecting poor narrative interpretation.

- **Unwarranted Content (minor issue, -0.5 points)**: Introductory sentence ("Below is a RACI matrix...") and legend add non-essential text not present in the ground truth. No extra tasks/roles/columns, but this bloats the response.

- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the core RACI content fails to "reflect the narrative" as per the ground truth (e.g., AM's accountability role is underrepresented in 3/6 activities). Terminology saves it from a 1.0, but content differences are pervasive, warranting a low-mid score. No self-awareness issues apply.
