8.0

The LLM answer adheres strictly to the terminology policy, correctly using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" and never mentioning forbidden terms. The formatting of the RACI matrix is clear and correctly scoped, and no extra content or unwarranted roles/columns are introduced.

However, there are notable differences in the role allocations, and these errors, even though some are subtle, represent significant issues:

- For **Receive Application**, IT is marked as "I", which matches the ground truth, but Compliance Officer and Finance Clerk are marked as "-", missing the ground truth's "C" and "I" respectively.
- For **KYC Review**, the LLM assigns "R/A" to Compliance (should be "R" only, as per ground truth); Account Manager is only "I" (where ground truth says "A"); Finance Clerk and IT Support are "-" and "I" (ground truth is "C" and "I").
- **Order Vetting**: The ground truth assigns "R/A" to Account Manager, "C" to Compliance Officer, and "I" to both othersâ€”LLM gives "R/A" to AM, "C" to CO, "-" to FC (should be "I"), and "I" to IT.
- **Payment Clearance**: LLM assigns "R/A" to FC, "I" to all others; ground truth gives "A" to AM, "C" to CO, "R" to FC, "I" to IT.
- **Record Update**: LLM omits "C" for other roles; ground truth distributes "C", "I", "C", "R" respectively.
- **Notify Customer**: LLM gives "R/A" to AM and "I" to IT only; ground truth is "R/A" to AM, "I" to all other roles.

Legend is clear and correct, but the assignment of R/A vs. splitting them as separate entries is less transparent, and multiple "R/A" in a cell is standard but not the same as some ground truth designations.

**Summary**: There are several minor, but strict, discrepancies in RACI allocations, and a few missing or incorrect assignments. Due to the scoring stringency, these warrant a notable deduction. However, the LLM answer is otherwise faithful to the format, scope, and terminology policy. Thus, 8.0.
