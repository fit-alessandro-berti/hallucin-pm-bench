**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (yes) and pinpoints the key shortcut path via T2b to enable T5 without prior T3, with a valid partial sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) and brief correct simulation summary. However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:

- **Major error (significant deduction: -3.0)**: Provides incorrect "shortest firing sequence" (length 4, stopping at T5). Ground truth requires the shortest sequence *demonstrating the order T5 before T3*, which must include T3 after T5 (T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3; length 6). LLM's sequence lacks T3, failing to witness "T5 before T3" in the trace (vacuous absence ≠ demonstrated precedence).
- **Errors in completeness (deduction: -1.0)**: No T6/T3 to enable post-T5 firing of T3 via feedback; omits why shortcut + loop proves feasibility.
- **Lack of detail/proof (deduction: -1.0)**: No step-by-step markings, no "why this works" explanation, no minimality proof/lower bound reasoning (GT proves ≥6 explicitly).
- Minor formatting/style diffs (negligible deduction: -0.0, as secondary).

Partial credit for core insight/path (base ~5.0); no credit for claiming unproven/wrong "shortest" or incomplete witness.
