**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate, comprehensive, and strictly evidence-based, matching the ground truth in verdict, case citations, key observations (reversed order in 1001/1003, absence in 1002), and conclusion that no cases support the claim. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate"; timestamps vs. line numbers; explicit consecutiveness note) are not errors and add value without deviation.
