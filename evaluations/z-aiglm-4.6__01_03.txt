5.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 9.0/10):** The LLM correctly identifies both decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate) and summarizes their rules accurately in one sentence each, matching the ground truth's intent and logic (e.g., "Low or Medium AND ≤ €250,000" skip; "at least two of three" approvals). Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., no explicit "otherwise proceeds" clause or quotation of "Approve," and use of bullets instead of numbered list) and not using the exact ground truth labels like "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check," but no factual errors or omissions.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 2.0/10):** Major incompleteness: The LLM omits the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicitly listed as required inputs/documents in Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) and thus appear before the Deck Memo. This results in only 6 items instead of the ground truth's 9, missing ~33% of the required documents in incorrect order. The included items are correct in sequence and separation (e.g., distinguishing Signed Offer Sheet 77), with no hallucinations, but the omission is a critical failure to list "**all** documents... in the order they first appear."

Overall score averages the parts with strict weighting toward completeness and fidelity to the ground truth, penalizing the severe gap in (b) heavily despite (a)'s strength.
