9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Correct calculation and rounding (5.56%), with minor formatting difference (no explicit Ã—100 shown, but result is accurate). Minimal deduction for incomplete formula display.
- **Question 3**: Perfect match (correctly identifies A1002 as the sole case). No deduction.
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons that align closely with ground truth concepts (a) matches "temporal bias"; b) overlaps with "selection bias" aspects like representativeness in case-mix or survivorship). However, phrasing and specificity differ from the exact listed examples (e.g., no mention of sample size variance or explicit biases like truncation), introducing small interpretive differences. Strict deduction for not mirroring ground truth options precisely.

Overall, the response is highly accurate with no hallucinations or inferences beyond the log, but minor variances in Q2 formatting and Q4 phrasing prevent a perfect score under strict criteria.
