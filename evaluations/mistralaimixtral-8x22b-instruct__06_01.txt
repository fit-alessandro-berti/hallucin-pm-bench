The LLM answer includes an entirely invalid pair ("Book_Courier — Pack_Items") from the explicitly ignored Process A, demonstrating failure to follow core instructions to "ignore Process A entirely" and refer "only to the process explicitly asked for" (Process B). This is a major error, not a small one. It also adds extraneous introductory prose, violating the specified output format of "one pair per line" with no additional text. While the two correct pairs are present and internally alphabetized correctly, the inclusion of hallucinated content, extra text, and minor spacing inconsistencies (e.g., no alignment as in ground truth) result in significant deviations under strict evaluation criteria. Only partial credit for the accurate pairs prevents a lower score.
