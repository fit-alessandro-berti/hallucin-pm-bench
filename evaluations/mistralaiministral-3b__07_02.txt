### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: Correctly identifies all three added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), though formatting uses IDs primarily while ground truth emphasizes names with IDs in parentheses. Minor stylistic difference, but content accurate—no deduction beyond strictness.
- **Removed tasks**: Major error—completely misses the removal of "Reject Loan" (Task_RejectLoan), which is explicitly present in v1 and absent in v2. Ground truth highlights this as a key change; listing "None" is factually wrong and omits a required summary of *all* changes, warranting significant point loss (e.g., half credit for this section).
- **Gateway-type changes**: Accurate identification of the change from exclusiveGateway (XOR) to inclusiveGateway (OR) for Gateway_Decision, with clear before/after reference. Matches ground truth closely.
- **Overall structure and adherence**: Uses the exact headings, but adds an unrequested "Explanation" section with redundant summary, violating "strictly under the three requested headings." Ignores instruction to ignore cosmetic changes (e.g., name updates like "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan" or gateway name to "Eligibility Check"), which it doesn't mention—good, but no extra credit. Strict evaluation penalizes incompleteness harshly: ~60% alignment due to missing core change, leading to a middling score with deductions for errors.
