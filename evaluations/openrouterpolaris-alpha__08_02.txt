1.0

The LLM answer incorrectly concludes "No" for Q1, directly contradicting the ground truth "Yes," and provides flawed reasoning for Q2 that overlooks the alternative path (T2-T7) to reach P5 without firing T3. It fails to provide a valid firing sequence, instead offering an invalid explanation that misrepresents token dependencies. This constitutes a complete factual reversal with no alignment to the ground truth, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
