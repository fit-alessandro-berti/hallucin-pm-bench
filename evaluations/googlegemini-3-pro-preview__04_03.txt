The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, correctly identifying non-compliance due to Rule 3 violation while assessing all rules. Minor deduction for omitting explicit mention of "once each" in Rule 1 justification (ground truth includes "appears once"), which partially under-references the rule's full requirements despite the trace satisfying it. Format differences (bullets vs. table) are negligible as both provide short, rule-referenced justifications per the prompt.
