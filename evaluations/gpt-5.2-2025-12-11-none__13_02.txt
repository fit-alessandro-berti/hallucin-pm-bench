**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct and complete:

- Q1: Exact match (1).
- Q2a/b: Exact matches (2.08%, 8.33%), with correct calculations shown, totals verified from log (48 events, 12 cases, 1 occurrence), and proper rounding to two decimals.
- Q3: 72 words (≤100); covers all required elements—(i) single occurrence (1/48 events, 1/12 cases), (ii) variance/instability (unstable/dominated by one case, overfit), (iii) over-generalisation caution (not representative, spurious correlations, distorts analyses, won't generalise). Stays strictly to log data; no invention.

No errors, deviations, or omissions, even minor.
