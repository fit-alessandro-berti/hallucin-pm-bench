3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Correct (3). No deduction.
- **Q2**: Correct ("Pack_Items"). No deduction.
- **Q3**: Correct (exact timestamp match). No deduction.
- **Q4**: Major error (8 instead of 2). This is a fundamental miscount of events in the log (only 2 instances of "Quality_Check" visible: one for B-1045, one for C-77). Significant deduction (-3.0 points equivalent, as counting is core to the task).
- **Q5**: Severe errors. The list includes incorrect activities (e.g., "Receive_Order" and "Quality_Check" appear as first events in cases A-9321, B-1045, and C-77), duplicates (e.g., "Pack_Items" and "Validate_Order" repeated), and extraneous items. Ground truth requires exactly ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] (the activities that never start a case). This shows complete misunderstanding of case sequencing and first-event identification. Major deduction (-4.0 points equivalent).

**Overall Rationale**: With utmost strictness, the response matches perfectly on 3/5 questions but fails catastrophically on the two requiring deeper log analysis (Q4 and Q5), introducing factual inaccuracies, duplicates, and irrelevancies that violate the "use only facts from the event-log" policy. This yields a low score, as even minor parsing errors would deduct notably, and these are not minor. The JSON structure is valid, but content fidelity is the primary criterion.
