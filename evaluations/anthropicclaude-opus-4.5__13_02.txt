**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete:

- Q1: Exact match (1 occurrence, correctly identifies C05).
- Q2a/b: Exact numeric matches (2.08%, 8.33%), with correct calculations shown, rounded to two decimals.
- Q3: 89 words (≤100); fully satisfies criteria—(i) emphasizes single occurrence ("one instance", "n=1"); (ii) notes instability ("lacks statistical reliability", "single observation, not a pattern", overfitting risk); (iii) cautions over-generalization ("risks false conclusions", model ignore/overfit). Derives only from log (e.g., C05 details verifiable). Covers performance (duration, cycle time, correlations) and predictive analyses precisely. No inventions, no errors.
