4.0

**Reasoning:**

### **Major Issues**

- **Wrong Activities:** The LLM answer invents/changes almost every activity:
    - It invents a userTask "Submit Support Ticket" (`t1`), but start should be a startEvent called "Ticket Submitted". There is no need for an explicit submit task.
    - Adds a user task "Classify Ticket" (`t2`), but in the ground truth, this is "Auto-Classification" (`t1`) — should be an automatic system task (plain `task`), not a `userTask`.
    - "Specialist Resolves Issue" (`t5`) is not a task in the description; forwarding to specialist is a task, then specialist work resolves.
    - Adds a separate userTask "Close Ticket" (`t8`), which is not present; closure is represented by an endEvent in the description.
- **Events Error:** Fails to use three gateways (should be 3; uses 2), misses a gateway for "Customer Confirms?" (which governs the rework loop).
- **Flows and Gateways:**
    - The first gateway ("Classify as Password Reset?") is modeled with two "outcome" elements and sequence flows from both the gateway and outcomes, which are not valid BPMN nor in the answer key.
    - Flows to and from the speculative "Close Ticket" task do not match the process logic.
    - Lacks proper handling of the rework loop that should go from "Customer conf.?" gateway back to "Initial Diagnosis". Instead, it goes from "Close Ticket" to "Initial Diagnosis" which is a significant modeling error.
- **Semantic Modeling Mismatch:** The control flow is different: e.g. Password Reset → Provide Reset Instructions → Confirm with Customer, but the LLM answer bypasses the confirmation gateway.
- **Element Choices:** Uses `userTask` for steps never said to be performed by a user (auto-classification, resolve, close).
- **Condition Expressions:** Fails to use any condition expressions or names on sequenceFlows, which are present in the answer key and provide decision logic.

### **Minor Issues**

- No use of namespaces (e.g., `xsi:type`, `targetNamespace`) or formatting per the key, but this is a lesser issue.
- IDs do not match, but this is minor if not mandated (not penalized much here).
- Overall, the answer exceeds the allowed errors regarding task/gateway/event modeling and logic.

### **Conclusion**

**Main points lost for:**
- Incorrect structure and element types (tasks vs. userTasks, no confirm gateway, etc.)
- Inventing activities ("Close Ticket," explicit "Submit")
- Failing to implement the customer confirmation/rework loop as specified
- Failure to use proper decision/condition expressions on sequence flows

**Some points preserved for:**
- There IS a general effort to follow a flow with sequence, gateways, and tasks.
- Two gateways used, and some order of steps appears similar to the source.
- No egregiously fabricated escalations, timers, or parallel paths.

**Final: 4.0 — Many severe structural and semantic mismatches, but basic BPMN and sequence elements are present with generally correct intent.**
