9.8

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in substance, structure, and adherence to the system instruction: it clearly states the value cannot be derived (matching "cannot be computed"), precisely identifies the missing data (timestamps/elapsed times vs. timestamps/durations), and provides a brief, accurate explanation of the calculation process while refusing to fabricate a number. Minor deductions (-0.2) for slight verbosity (hypothetical calculation steps not emphasized as "fabricated" risk) and phrasing differences ("derive" vs. "computed"; omits explicit "ordering information" though implicit in lacking timestamps), but no substantive errors or policy violations.
