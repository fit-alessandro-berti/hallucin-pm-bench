The LLM answer is essentially correct: it clearly states that the required metrics cannot be computed because all event rows and timestamp values have been redacted—the exact reason outlined in the ground truth answer. The LLM avoids guessing and does not use any outside information, precisely as instructed.

**Minor differences that warrant a deduction:**
- The LLM’s explanation is slightly more verbose than the ground truth, including a statement about not violating constraints rather than simply noting that more raw data are needed.
- It reiterates some constraints (e.g., "Any numerical estimate would be speculative...") not found in the ground truth. While technically accurate, it’s a slight divergence from simply stating “impossible” and specifying the absence.
- The LLM answer does not explicitly state that "additional raw log entries are required," though it is implied.

These are minor but real style and explicitness differences, so a point is deducted for utmost strictness.

**Score:** 9.0
