10.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, directly mirroring the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate), coverage of all three cases, identification of reversed ordering where present, absence of Update_Inventory in case 1002, and overall conclusion that no case supports the claimed sequence. Minor stylistic variances (e.g., timestamps vs. line numbers; phrasing like "subsequent" vs. "never appears") do not introduce errors or omissions, as both adhere strictly to the data without speculation.
