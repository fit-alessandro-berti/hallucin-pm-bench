The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly, both in substance and in bullet-point format:

1. Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases: C123, C456, C789.
2. Correctly identifies "Pack_Items" as the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" in case C456.
3. Correctly identifies "Cancel_Order" as the activity that appears exactly once.
