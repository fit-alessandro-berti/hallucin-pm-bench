4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
Evaluating with utmost strictness as instructed, the LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth and prompt requirements in content accuracy, categorization, formatting, and completeness. Below is a breakdown of errors, each contributing to major point deductions (no partial credit for near-misses; even minor formatting issues incur substantial loss per instructions).

#### Content and Categorization Errors (Severe Deductions: -4.0 total impact, dropping from 10.0 to 6.0)
- **Misplaced Gateway Change in ADDED TASKS**: The LLM incorrectly includes `(Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel)` under ADDED TASKS. This is not a task addition but a gateway type change, violating the prompt's strict separation of categories and "verifiable differences" rule. Ground truth correctly omits it here. (Deduction: -1.5; fundamental miscategorization.)
- **Missed REMOVED TASKS**: LLM states "None," but ground truth identifies `Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)` as removed (present in v1 XML, absent in v2). This is a complete omission of a verifiable functional change. (Deduction: -1.5; ignores explicit prompt to list all changes.)
- **Incomplete GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: LLM lists only `Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel`, missing `Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel` (v1 uses `exclusiveGateway`; v2 uses `parallelGateway`). Ground truth includes both. Duplication of the first in ADDED exacerbates the error. (Deduction: -1.0; partial but incomplete.)

Correct elements (3 added tasks identified) provide minimal baseline credit, but errors in placement/content outweigh this.

#### Formatting and Style Errors (Strict Deductions: -2.0 total impact, dropping to 4.0)
- **Headings**: LLM uses bold markdown (`**ADDED TASKS**`), but prompt requires verbatim plain text ("ADDED TASKS"). Ground truth matches exactly. (Deduction: -0.5.)
- **Task Listing Format**: Prompt specifies "id followed by the name in parentheses" (e.g., `Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)`). LLM uses `(id: name)` with colons and enclosing parentheses, mismatching ground truth's `- id (name)` bullet style. No bullets/dashes used. (Deduction: -0.8; small but per strictness, significant loss.)
- **Gateway Format**: LLM omits «» quotes around the change description (prompt example: `*«old type → new type»*`), and ground truth uses `- id: change` with alignment. Inconsistent and non-verbatim. (Deduction: -0.4.)
- **Extra/Unauthorized Elements**: "None" under REMOVED is commentary (prompt forbids "add no commentary"); lists lack required bullet structure. (Deduction: -0.3.)

#### Overall Compliance (No Additional Deduction, but Caps Score)
- Output includes only the three headings (good), in order (good), and avoids unchanged elements/commentary (mostly, except "None").
- No guessing/intentions (adhered to).
- However, cumulative errors make it ~40% accurate to ground truth (3/6 total changes correct but mangled; full sections wrong).

A perfect match would score 10.0. This is far from it, warranting a low-mid score. Minor fixes alone could boost to 7-8, but content flaws are disqualifying.
