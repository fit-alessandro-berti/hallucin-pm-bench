**9.2**

The LLM answer is functionally identical and fully solves the task by reusing the existing unused escalation activity with an interrupting boundary timer on "Create Account in Core System" to enforce the 48-hour SLA from approximately the end of "Verify Identity," returning only added XML elements and a concise one-sentence justification. Minor deductions for: (1) incorrect `xsi:type="bpmn:tExpression"` (abstract type; should be `tFormalExpression` as in ground truth and prompt's conditions for schema validity), (2) different/less descriptive IDs and missing `name="48h breach"` attribute on boundaryEvent, (3) slightly less precise justification phrasing (e.g., "review task" abbreviation vs. full "**Account-Manager Review** task", no "pre-existing"/"timeout" wording), and (4) lack of explanatory comments and XML code block formatting present in ground truth. These small technical/style differences warrant a strict but not severe deduction under utmost scrutiny.
