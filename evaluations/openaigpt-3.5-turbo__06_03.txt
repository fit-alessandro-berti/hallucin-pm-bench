The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order, matching the ground truth content perfectly (no factual errors, no extraneous info on A/C, adheres strictly to the prompt). Minor deductions for stylistic/formatting differences: lacks bolding/backticks/‖ symbol/"Set X – X parallel block" phrasing, uses "and" + split labels instead, and omits the closing sentence (small but noticeable textual variances under utmost strictness).
