**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Perfect: +2.0)**: Uses exact mandated terms (**KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance**) with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms appear. Activities match exactly.
- **Structure & Formatting (~50% match: +0.7)**: Table format correct (rows=activities, columns=roles). Headers close but add unnecessary abbreviations "(AM)" etc. (+0.2 penalty). Bolds all activities (+0.3 penalty vs. ground truth's selective bolding). Adds unwarranted title "### RACI Matrix..." and partial "Key" (+0.5 penalty).
- **RACI Content (Major Failures: -5.8 total from 10 base)**: 
  - Only populates **R** (Responsible) for doers, matching process narrative exactly (6/6 correct positions; +1.5). Each row has exactly one R (+0.5).
  - **Critically incomplete**: Zero **A** (Accountable), **C** (Consulted), **I** (Informed) entries (ground truth has ~24 entries across all). Misses AM as A/R+A in 3 rows (e.g., "R/A" vs. "R"). No multi-entries like "R / A" (+1.0 penalty).
  - Does not "reflect the narrative" fully per rubric (infers only explicit doers, ignores implied consultations/accountability; -2.0).
- **Unwarranted Content (Minor issue: -0.3)**: Extra title and incomplete key; no extra tasks/roles.
- **Overall Closeness to Ground Truth (~30% visual/content match)**: Fundamentally not a full RACI matrix (sparse vs. populated). Small diffs (e.g., bolding, spacing, no notes) amplify under strictness (-1.0). 

Total derived: Starts at 10.0, deducts for incompleteness (primary failure), yielding 3.2.
