3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer receives a low score due to multiple critical deviations from the prompt and ground truth (GT), including omissions of required elements, invalid XML structure, non-verbatim task names, and incorrect modeling of explicit flows. While it attempts the core structure (start, gateways, parallel branches, two ends), semantic equivalence is severely compromised. Key deductions:

- **Omissions of required elements (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: 
  - Missing task for "Send rejection notice" (prompt step 3: explicit activity before ending; GT includes `wrc_reject` task → direct flow to named end event is hallucinated/incomplete).
  - Missing task for "Close the claim" (prompt step 5: explicit activity after "update inventory records" before ending; GT includes `wrc_close` task → end event wrongly named/performs the task).
  - These violate "model only the flow elements explicitly mentioned" and "do not invent... paths beyond what is stated," resulting in incomplete process representation.

- **Invalid XML structure and connections (major deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Broken sequence flows: `wrc_flow1` incorrectly targets/incoming to `wrc_decision1` (gateway) instead of connecting `wrc_validate` → gateway (validate's `<outgoing>wrc_decision1</outgoing>` has no matching flow ID; semantically, validation loop is non-functional).
  - This renders the XML non-executable/invalid BPMN, differing from GT's clean, connected flows (e.g., `wrc_sf2` from validate to `wrc_complete_gw`).

- **Non-verbatim task/gateway names and details (moderate deduction: -0.5 points)**:
  - Start event name="Start" (GT/prompt implies "online warranty claim" submission; not verbatim).
  - "Check warranty eligibility" (prompt: "checks warranty eligibility" – minor, but strictness penalizes).
  - "Schedule courier pickup" (prompt: "Schedule courier pickup of the faulty product" – omits phrase, not verbatim).
  - End event names: "Rejection notice" (should follow task) and "Close claim" (should be task + neutral end; GT uses "Rejected" and "Successful end").
  - Gateway names like "Is claim complete?" add invention (GT: concise "Claim complete?").

- **Extra/hallucinated elements (moderate deduction: -0.5 points)**:
  - Uses `<userTask>` instead of `<task>` (prompt/GT use generic task; unnecessary subtype).
  - Adds `<conditionExpression>` (e.g., "claimValid") on flows (GT omits; not required/invented logic).
  - Process `isExecutable="true"` (GT: "false"; minor but extra).
  - Named parallel gateways ("Parallel Split/Join"; GT unnamed).

- **Partial correctness (base: +4.0 points, adjusted down)**:
  - Correctly includes start, two exclusive gateways, parallel split/join, update inventory task, and basic loop for incomplete claims.
  - IDs prefixed "wrc_" (matches).
  - Two end events present (though misused).
  - Overall length/structure attempts minimalism but exceeds GT's 34 lines due to extras.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 3.0 for fundamental failures in completeness, validity, and fidelity. Semantically, it partially models the process but cannot be considered equivalent due to broken flows and missing explicit tasks.
