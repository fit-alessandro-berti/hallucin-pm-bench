The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B, lists them one per line in the specified format, ensures alphabetical ordering both within pairs (Create_Documentation < Quality_Check; Procure_Materials < Schedule_Machines) and overall (C... before P...), and ignores Process A as instructed. No extra or missing pairs.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for:
- Lack of markdown code block (```) enclosing the output, as present in ground truth.
- Insufficient left-padding spaces in the second pair to vertically align the "—" with the first pair (ground truth uses ~5 spaces after "Procure_Materials" for monospace alignment; LLM uses ~2). 
- Possible extraneous trailing whitespace after "Quality_Check" in first line.

These are small formatting discrepancies under utmost strictness but do not affect semantic correctness.
