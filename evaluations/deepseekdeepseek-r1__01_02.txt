8.2

**Justification:**

The LLM answer is overall accurate but not perfect. Evaluating with utmost strictness and penalizing even small errors:

**Strengths:**
- Lists all three required decision points using exact activity names.
- Accurately describes each decision point’s function.
- Lists all required documents, using the correct names and order.
- Explicitly avoids introducing standard loan terminology.

**Small Errors:**
- The LLM’s bullet for “Underwriter Alignment Gate” lacks the explicit mention of proceeding “after the Dual Underwriter Split” (though the intent is clear).
- "Amount Threshold Decision" references "escalation"—should read "proceed" or "send to," as described in the process. "Escalation" is not process terminology here.
- The phrase "Board vote required for amounts ≥€15 000" (Decision 3) omits “Approve or Reject” (minor omission).
- "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes "template" (slight inaccuracy vs. list in ground truth).
- Some formatting variations (e.g., not using numbering for documents) compared to ground truth.

**No Critical Errors:**
- No factual errors, omissions, or misuse of standard loan language.

**Conclusion:**  
Subtle mismatches in formulation and lack of process flow detail after each decision point warrant deductions, but coverage and terminology are correct.  
**Score: 8.2**
