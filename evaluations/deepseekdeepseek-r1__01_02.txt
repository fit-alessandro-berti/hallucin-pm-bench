7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is mostly accurate in identifying the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing all six required documents without introducing prohibited terminology. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth warrant significant deductions:

#### Decision Points (≈ -1.5 points total deduction)
- **Structure and detail**: LLM includes unnecessary step numbers (e.g., "(Step 5)"), which the ground truth omits for a cleaner summary. Ground truth provides precise contextual placement (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which LLM lacks.
- **Wording precision**:
  - Underwriter Alignment Gate: LLM simplifies to ">2 points" (equivalent but less explicit); ground truth fully specifies "≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate" and names "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" explicitly.
  - Amount Threshold Decision: LLM uses "escalation to the Micro-loan Board" (imprecise shorthand); ground truth says "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval." LLM also uses "<€15 000" without the exact arrow notation (⇒) for conditions.
  - Final Micro-loan Board Approval: LLM adds a condition ("for amounts ≥€15 000") not present in ground truth's standalone description; ground truth uses bolded "**Approve** or **Reject**" and includes "(MBA)" abbreviation.
- **Note**: LLM's note introduces an unrequested explanation ("Process follows non-standard... skips credit-bureau checks"), differing from ground truth's focused note on excluded documents.

#### Required Documents (≈ -1.0 points total deduction)
- **Formatting**: LLM uses bullets (▪) while ground truth uses a numbered list (1–6), deviating from the exact presentation.
- **Wording inconsistencies** (small but per strictness, significant):
  - Proof of Address: LLM adds "old" ("≤3 months old"); ground truth is concise ("≤ 3 months").
  - Latest Income Statement: LLM expands to "single pay-stub or tax slip"; ground truth shortens to "pay-stub/tax slip" (omitting "single" and using "/").
  - Community Impact Statement: LLM adds "template" ("(CIS) template"); ground truth is simply "(CIS)".
- **Note**: Similar issue as above—LLM's note is broader and less aligned with ground truth's specific exclusions ("No credit bureau report, collateral forms...").

No major omissions or errors, but these cumulative phrasing, formatting, and extraneous details reduce fidelity to the ground truth, justifying a mid-high score rather than perfect.
