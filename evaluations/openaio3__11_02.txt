8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely mirrors the ground truth in structure (executive memo format, ≤200 words), identification of the three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment—correctly prioritized by combined high wait times, processing durations, rework rates, and SLA breaches from the table), and overall explanations tied to table metrics (e.g., 150-min wait, 22% rework, 12.4% SLA). Recommendations are concrete and data-driven, with projections (e.g., ~70% rework cut, 40% time reduction) that align with the task's intent, though they incorporate external analogies ("peer firms," "pilot tests") not in the table, similar to the ground truth's projections (e.g., "halve rework," ≈10% throughput lift).

However, under utmost strictness:
- Factual error in Request_Documents explanation: "150-min average queue (10× process mean)" is inaccurate and unsubstantiated by the table (activity's processing time is 5 min, yielding 30×; no "process mean" defined, making this a hallucinated or miscalculated multiplier—significant deduction for precision).
- Minor additions like explicit throughput drop calculation (-30%) and mentioning other activities (Pay_Claim, Notify_Customer) in the recommendation, while derivable and not absent from the table, exceed "strictly on the table" by introducing unprompted cross-references (ground truth avoids this).
- Slightly less emphasis on upstream cascading in Initial_Assessment explanation compared to ground truth.

These small but clear deviations (error + interpretive additions) warrant a meaningful point loss from a potential 10.0, but the response remains highly faithful overall.
