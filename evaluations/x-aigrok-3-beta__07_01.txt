The LLM answer accurately identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway) with no additions, omissions, or speculation, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements. Minor deductions for stylistic differences from the ground truth, including: swapped order of id/name presentation in task lists (id first vs. name first), lack of version specifiers "(v1)" and "(v2)" in the gateway change, absence of backticks around ids, and differing bullet styles (- vs. *). These are small formatting variances but warrant a strict reduction per evaluation guidelines, though content fidelity remains excellent.
