The LLM answer is nearly identical in substance, precision, and adherence to instructions: it correctly identifies the absence of data in Artefact A (redacted rows/timestamps), explicitly lists all requested metrics, explains why calculations are impossible without raw event-level data, and distinguishes Artefact B's irrelevance—all in one short paragraph without guessing or tables. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., elaborating on SLA's aggregate metrics with an example not in ground truth) and phrasing differences ("We cannot compute..." vs. "Impossible —"; "timestamp values" vs. explicit "start_time / complete_time"; "dispersion" covered implicitly), but these are negligible semantic equivalents under strict evaluation.
