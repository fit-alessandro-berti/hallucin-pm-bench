9.5

The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth answer, with only very minor deviations in formatting and emphasis:

- **Added tasks:** Correctly identifies all three tasks added, matches both name and IDs.
- **Removed tasks:** Correctly identifies the only removed task, matches both name and IDs.
- **Gateway-type changes:** Correctly notes that Gateway_Decision went from Exclusive to Inclusive. However, the answer writes out "Exclusive Gateway" and "Inclusive Gateway" whereas the ground truth gives both the formal term ("exclusive (XOR)") and informal ("inclusive (OR)"). The LLM omits the (XOR)/(OR) for further clarity, which is a minor loss in precision compared to the ground truth.

No errors in omission or commission regarding tasks or gateway-type changes are present; all content is accurate and strictly grouped as requested. There is a slight drop for the lack of full explicitness in the gateway type terminology and the less-formal formatting, hence 9.5 instead of 10.0.
