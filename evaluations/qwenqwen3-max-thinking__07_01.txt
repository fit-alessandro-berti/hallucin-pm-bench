### Evaluation Rationale
**Factual Accuracy (perfect, full points):** 
- Correctly identified all added tasks by exact XML `id` attributes: `check_vip`, `generate_qr`.
- Correctly identified removed task by exact XML `id`: `send_rma_label`.
- Correctly identified gateway type change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`.
- No extra or missing changes; no speculation; no "(none)" needed.

**Format and Style Differences (minor deductions, -1.0 total):**
- Headings match prompt's exact specification (`• Added tasks` etc.) precisely, unlike ground truth's `**Added tasks**` bold style.
- Lists use simple newlines under headings (acceptable per prompt, which doesn't specify sub-format).
- Missing ground truth's details like full `name` attributes ("Check Customer VIP Status"), `(id = \`id\`)` syntax, `*` sub-bullets, backticks, bolding on types, `(v1)/(v2)`, and final note. However, prompt requires **only** "element names exactly as they appear in the XML" (interpreted strictly as `id` values, not `name` labels), so this is not an error but a stylistic divergence from ground truth (-0.5).
- Gateway phrasing concise and accurate but lacks ground truth's exact wording, bolding, and version labels (-0.5).

**Strictness Applied:** Semantically identical to ground truth; deductions only for presentation variances despite factual/per-prompt perfection. No criminal/unsafe content issues.
