7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer is mostly accurate but contains several small deviations from the ground truth, warranting significant deductions under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points**:
  - Omits explicit contextual placements (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which are present in the ground truth for precision in summarizing the flow (-1.0 point).
  - Uses "proceed to step 6" and "proceed to step 8," introducing process numbering not used in the ground truth or prompt, slightly altering the exact terminology (-0.5 point).
  - Minor phrasing: "votes to approve or reject" vs. ground truth's capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**" and more concise structure (-0.3 point).
  - Overall structure is a reasonable summary but less compact than ground truth's format.

- **Required Documents**:
  - Lists all items correctly but introduces small wording variations: "≤ 3 months old" (vs. "≤ 3 months"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (vs. "pay-stub/tax slip," omitting "single" and "Latest"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" (vs. "(CIS)," omitting "template") (-1.0 point total for these inexact phrasings, as the prompt emphasizes "exact terminology").
  - Uses bullets instead of numbered list, a minor format difference (-0.2 point).
  - Omits the ground truth's explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which reinforces the prompt's non-standard emphasis, though not explicitly required (-0.5 point for completeness).

No major errors or introductions of standard loan terminology, so it avoids deeper penalties. Total deductions: -3.5 from 10.0.
