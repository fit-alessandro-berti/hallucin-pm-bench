3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Perfect, +2.0 points)**: The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere.
- **Structure and Format (Partial, +1.0 point)**: The matrix follows a basic table format with activities as rows and roles as columns. However, it introduces an unwarranted title ("RACI Matrix – FinCo Order-to-Cash Workflow") and a "Key" explanation, which are not present in the ground truth. Cell notations differ (e.g., "R A" vs. "**R / A**"; no bolding on key terms like "**KYC Review**" or R/A cells). Activity labels are not bolded where required in ground truth.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, -5.5 points)**: Strict comparison to ground truth reveals significant discrepancies in 8 out of 24 cells, violating the "reflect the narrative" criterion (e.g., exactly one Responsible per activity is mostly met, but Accountable roles for AM are inconsistently applied). Key differences:
  - **Receive Application**: CO is "I" (LLM) vs. "C" (GT) — incorrect consultation.
  - **KYC Review**: AM is "C" vs. "A"; CO is "R A" vs. "R" (unwarranted extra A); FC is "I" vs. "C" — three errors.
  - **Order Vetting**: Exact match (+1.0 implicit).
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM is "C" vs. "A"; CO is "I" vs. "C"; FC is "R A" vs. "R" (unwarranted extra A) — three errors (one partial match on R).
  - **Record Update**: AM is "I" vs. "C"; FC is "I" vs. "C"; IT is "R A" vs. "R" (unwarranted extra A) — three errors (one partial).
  - **Notify Customer**: Exact match (+1.0 implicit).
  These are not minor; even single-cell mismatches (e.g., extra "A" or missing "C") indicate failure to precisely mirror ground truth's interpretive RACI based on the process narrative.
- **Unwarranted Content (Minor Deduction, -0.5 point)**: No extra tasks or roles, but the added title and key qualify as extraneous.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: With utmost strictness applied, small errors (e.g., "I" vs. "C") and patterns of extra "A" assignments compound to a low score, as the rubric emphasizes fidelity to ground truth over general correctness. Base score of 10.0 reduced proportionally for ~33% cell mismatch rate and formatting inconsistencies.
