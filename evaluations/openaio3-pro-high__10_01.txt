7.0

- The LLM answer adheres to the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"), exactly as required.
- The activity names are spelled and capitalized exactly as specified.
- No forbidden terms are present, and the process nor roles are misstated.
- No extraneous information or roles/activities are introduced.

However, several significant and smaller errors in the RACI allocations compared to the ground truth:

1. For "KYC Review", the answer has "C" for Account Manager (AM), but ground truth is "A". It has "R A" for Compliance Officer (CO), correct per ground truth R, but it merges the Accountable ("A") as well, whereas ground truth is Accountable to AM.
2. For "Order Vetting", "R A" given to AM is correct, but has "C" for CO (correct).
3. For "Payment Clearance", LLM gives "C" for AM (should be "A"), "I" for CO (should be "C"), "R A" for FC (should be just "R"), and "I" for IT (correct).
4. For "Record Update", "I" for AM (should be "C"), "I" for CO (correct), "I" for FC (should be "C"), and "R A" for IT (should be just "R").
5. For "Notify Customer", "R A" for AM (correct), "I" for others (correct).

Notably, the LLM sometimes gives both "R" and "A" to the same role where, per the ground truth, "A" was assigned to one and "R" to another (KYC Review). It also misses some "C" and "A" assignments, and sometimes merges "R" and "A" when ground truth splits them.

Because the vocabulary is perfect and there is no extraneous content, but the RACI assignments are not precisely correct in several rows and columns, the answer is penalized heavily, but it is not a catastrophic failure (which would rate below 6).

Thus, strict grading: **7.0**
