9.6

The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth:

1) The occurrence count ("exactly once") is correct.

2a) The percentage for all events, 2.08%, is correctly calculated.

2b) The percentage for all unique cases, 8.33%, is correct.

3) The short explanation meets the requirements: it clearly states the issue of low support ("appears in only one of the 12 cases"), mentions the risk of overemphasizing or ignoring ("produce incorrect... estimates and predictions"), points to instability of statistics ("minimal number... undermines reliability"), and warns about risks in model building ("distorting the overall process picture").

Minuscule deduction (0.4) for very minor imprecision in wording for part 3 (the wordings "overemphasizing or ignoring" is not quite as explicit as discussing "variance/instability" and "confidence intervals remain wide", although the sense is present). Calculation rounding and values are precise.

Overall, this answer is almost perfect, with only a negligible difference in depth/detail of the caveat in (3).
