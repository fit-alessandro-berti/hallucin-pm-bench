The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Questions 2a and 2b provide precise calculations with correct rounding (2.08% and 8.33%). For question 3, the response (78 words) adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, explicitly addresses the single occurrence (in 1/12 cases), highlights instability/variance (e.g., unreliable averages, inflated times, misleading probabilities), and cautions against over-generalization (risks distorting models/process picture), aligning with ground truth requirements without inventions or deviations.
