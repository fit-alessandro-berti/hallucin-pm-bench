**7.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria Applied):
- **Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4**: Exact match to ground truth → Full credit (no differences).
- **Q5**: Significant errors:
  - Incorrect length (4 items vs. 3).
  - Includes extraneous/wrong item `"Quality_Check"` (this activity **does** appear as the first event in case C-77, per log line 10).
  - Contains correct items ("Pack_Items", "Ship_Order", "Validate_Order") but failure to exclude "Quality_Check" indicates failure to properly group/sequence events by case ID from the shuffled log.
  - Order irrelevant per schema, but content mismatch is factual error violating "only use facts... if absent, UNKNOWN" instruction indirectly (inferred wrongly).
- **Overall**: 4/5 questions perfect (80% weight), but Q5 ~25% accurate (3/4 items correct, but extra wrong item + length mismatch = major deviation). Strict penalty for any factual/logic error: deduct 3.0 points total. No JSON formatting issues.
