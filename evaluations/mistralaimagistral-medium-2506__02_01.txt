8.0

The answer is largely correct, matching the ground truth for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, there is a notable error in Q5: it includes "Quality_Check" incorrectly in the list of activities that never appear as the first event, when in fact "Quality_Check" is the first event for case "C-77". This is a direct violation of the instructions and represents a substantive factual error. All other responses are precise and accurate. Due to the strictest evaluation criteria and the concrete error in Q5, a loss of 2 points is appropriate, resulting in a score of 8.0.
