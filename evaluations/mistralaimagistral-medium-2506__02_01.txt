The LLM answer is correct for Q1â€“Q4, matching the ground truth exactly. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (an activity that does appear as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an invalid list with an extraneous item. This is a significant factual error, as it misidentifies activities that "never appear as the first event" and violates the prompt's strict reliance on direct log facts, warranting a substantial deduction under the evaluation criteria. The response otherwise adheres to the JSON schema.
