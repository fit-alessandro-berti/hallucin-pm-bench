6.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Factual Accuracy (high marks here)**: The LLM correctly identifies the added tasks (check_vip, generate_qr), removed task (send_rma_label), and gateway change (gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway). No speculation or extraneous details are included, and no empty categories are mishandled. This matches the core facts of the ground truth.
- **Use of Element Names (major deduction)**: The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML." For tasks, the XML includes both `id` and `name` attributes (e.g., `name="Check Customer VIP Status"`). The LLM uses only IDs (e.g., "check_vip"), omitting the descriptive names, while the ground truth includes full names with IDs (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). This is a strict violation, as names are explicitly in the XML and provide the intended "element names." Significant point loss (-2.0) for incomplete adherence.
- **Formatting and Structure (moderate deduction)**: Headings match the required "• Added tasks" etc., which is good. However, the ground truth uses bulleted lists (* ) with structured phrasing, while the LLM uses comma-separated IDs in plain lines and a concise arrow for the gateway change. The gateway description lacks version specificity (e.g., "(v1)" and "(v2)") and bolding for types, making it less precise. The ground truth's note "(No other differences should be reported.)" is absent but not required, so no deduction there. Minor formatting inconsistencies warrant deduction (-1.0).
- **Strictness Applied**: With utmost strictness, the omission of task names is not minor—it's a direct deviation from using "exact" XML details, leading to a less informative output compared to the ground truth. No perfect match in detail or presentation, but core facts prevent a lower score. Total: Starting from 10.0, deductions yield 6.5.
