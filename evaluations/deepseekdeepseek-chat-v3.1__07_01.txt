7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the changes and categorizes them under the appropriate headings. However, it deviates from the required format in several important ways:

- The LLM uses only the element ids for tasks under "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks," instead of the full task name and id as given in the ground truth (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)" instead of just "check_vip").
- The LLM does not use the exact heading formatting requested in the user prompt (the example in the ground truth uses headings in bold and each item with both name and id, while the LLM uses a list with a bullet and only mentions the id).
- In "Gateway type changes," the LLM answer uses a condensed form: "gw_valid: exclusiveGateway â†’ inclusiveGateway" instead of the full, explicit sentence with the id formatted as code and both BPMN types highlighted.
- The ground truth says to report full task names and ids exactly as shown in the XML ("element names exactly as they appear in the XML"), but the LLM omits the task names.

All differences, particularly the omission of task names and deviation from required format, reflect significant loss of points per the strict grading guideline. Otherwise, the factual content is correct, which prevents a lower score.
