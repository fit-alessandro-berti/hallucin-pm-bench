**9.2**

1. The LLM answer matches the ground truth numerically for all quantitative questions.

2. For question 3 (qualitative explanation), the LLM answer is accurate and meets the core criteria:
   - It explicitly mentions "only 1 occurrence" and that it's "not representative."
   - It notes difficulty in estimating impact, duration, and relationships—that is, it expresses variance/instability concerns.
   - It cautions that this can lead to "biased or incorrect conclusions" if generalized.

There is a very minor shortcoming: The LLM's wording is somewhat more general/less precise than the ground truth, and doesn't explicitly mention some detailed effects (e.g., "wide confidence intervals", "skew averages", "model’s estimates collapse to 0%"). However, the requirements (i), (ii), and (iii) are met.

Accordingly:
- Full marks for numeric items.
- Nearly full marks for the explanation, with a small deduction for missing the specificity and technical detail in the model answer.

**Deduction:** -0.8 for softer phrasing and not explicitly mentioning statistical effects like variance/skew/confidence.

**Final score:** **9.2**
