10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1 and 2 (a/b), with precise counts and percentages rounded to two decimals as required. For question 3, the response is concise (78 words, under 100), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue (explicitly states "only 1 occurrence"), notes instability/variance in estimation (e.g., "difficult to accurately estimate its impact, duration, or relationships"), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "not... representative... biased or incorrect conclusions" when generalizing from the slice). No inventions beyond the log; fully compliant and deterministic where applicable.
