7.5

The LLM answer correctly uses the required preferred terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) and avoids the forbidden phrases, which is essential. However, there are several notable discrepancies from the ground truth RACI assignments, which significantly impact the score:

1. **RACI/Roles Assignments**:
   - The LLM answer only uses "R" (Responsible) and "I" (Informed), omitting "A" (Accountable) and "C" (Consulted), except for the note about "A" and "C" in the legend. However, "A" and "C" should be present in the matrix itself, per the ground truth.
   - For most activities, the LLM only assigns a single "R", with all other roles marked "I", instead of the mix of "R/A", "C", "I" across the roles as in the ground truth.

2. **Content Structure**
   - The LLM matrix format is correct, and no extra/missing activities or roles are introduced, which is good.

3. **Strictness Guidance**
   - The lack of proper role distribution and missing "A"/"C" entries are substantial errors as per the strict rubric.

**Deductions:**
- -1.0: For omitting "A" assignments in the matrix.
- -1.0: For omitting "C" assignments in the matrix.
- -0.5: For failing to match ground truth RACIs beyond only using "R" and "I" (logic oversimplified).
 
**Positives:**
- No forbidden terms used.
- All activities are correct, and no extra roles/tasks are introduced.
- Matrix structure is presentable.

**Total**: 7.5/10
