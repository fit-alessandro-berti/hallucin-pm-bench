### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Positive, ~3/10 contribution)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This meets the strict policy but is the only strong match.
- **RACI Matrix Structure (Partial, ~2/10 contribution)**: The matrix format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced, aligning with "unwarranted content" avoidance. However, column headers include abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") not in the ground truth, and the notes introduce unnecessary explanations/offers (e.g., "Let me know if you'd like..."), adding extraneous content.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, ~0/10 contribution)**: This is the core failure. The ground truth requires precise assignments reflecting the narrative, including Accountable (A) roles (primarily for Account Manager where appropriate) and Consulted (C) roles. The LLM simplifies to only Responsible (R) and Informed (I), omitting all A and C entirelyâ€”e.g.:
  - Receive Application: LLM (AM: R, CO: I) vs. GT (AM: R/A, CO: C).
  - KYC Review: LLM (AM: I, CO: R, FC: I) vs. GT (AM: A, CO: R, FC: C).
  - Similar mismatches in every row (e.g., no A for AM in Order Vetting/Payment Clearance/Notify Customer; incorrect I vs. C for CO/FC in multiple steps; Record Update has AM/FC as I vs. GT C).
  - Each row has one R (correct per rubric), but the absence of A/C violates full RACI completeness and narrative reflection (e.g., AM's accountability in handled steps). Notes falsely claim C "not shown" despite RACI requiring it.
- **Overall Strictness**: Per instructions, even small errors warrant significant point loss; here, pervasive mismatches in ~70% of cells (all non-R positions) and omission of key RACI elements (A/C) make this a near-total deviation from ground truth. Partial credit only for terminology and basic structure prevents a 1.0.
