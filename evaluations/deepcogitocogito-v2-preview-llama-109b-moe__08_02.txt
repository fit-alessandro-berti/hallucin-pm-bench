The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on both questions. It wrongly concludes "No" for Q1, missing the alternative path via T2-T7-T4 that enables T5 using the lingering token in P2 without firing T3. For Q2, it provides a flawed explanation that T3 is required for P5 (ignoring T7's role in marking P4), with no valid sequence. This inverts the ground truth entirely, warranting the minimum score due to complete misunderstanding of the net's structure and reachable markings.
