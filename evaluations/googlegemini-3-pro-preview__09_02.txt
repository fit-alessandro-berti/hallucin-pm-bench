The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, correctly identifying the impossibility due to missing timestamps and durations, with phrasing that closely mirrors the ground truth in structure and intent; minor wording variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and "time elapsed" vs. "start-to-completion intervals") prevent a perfect score under strict evaluation.
