9.5

The LLM answer is almost perfect. It correctly identifies that the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the provided data and gives a detailed explanation why (absence of timestamps/durations). It also avoids making up any values or using inappropriate benchmarks.

The only (minor) difference from the ground truth is that the LLM elaborates slightly more than necessary, e.g., discussing the meaning of cycle time and outlining calculation steps *if* data were available. While informative, this is marginally outside the strict minimum required by the user, and a very strict assessment would subtract half a point for verbosity that was not explicitly requested.

Thus, the score is 9.5.
