The LLM answer is entirely incorrect and violates multiple instructions: it lists sequential tasks (e.g., Accept_Custom_Order), treats parallel tasks as individual lines instead of grouped sets, includes tasks from Process C (Inspect_Product (onsite), Ship_To_Service_Center), and fails to identify the exact three parallel blocks from Process B. Zero alignment with ground truth.
