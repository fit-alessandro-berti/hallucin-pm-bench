10.0

- The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content (3 cases with identical identifiers, "Pack_Items", "Cancel_Order").
- Minor phrasing ("distinct" explicitly included, matching prompt wording) and formatting variations (bullets without A1/A2/A3 labels) are negligible, as they align with the prompt's "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction and do not alter meaning or accuracy.
