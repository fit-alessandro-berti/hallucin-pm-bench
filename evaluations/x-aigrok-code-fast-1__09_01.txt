The LLM answer is an excellent match to the ground truth: it correctly states that the value cannot be derived/computed, provides a precise and relevant explanation tied to the absence of temporal data (redacted timestamps/elapsed times), and adheres strictly to the system instruction without fabricating any information. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed"; brief mention of irrelevant benchmarks, which aligns with the context) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they enhance clarity without deviation.
