The LLM answer exactly matches the requirements of the ground truth:

- It states clearly and directly that the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the provided data, due to the absence of time-related fields.  
- The explanation fully and explicitly mentions the reason (lack of timestamps/durations), and correctly refrains from producing a fabricated value.  
- It also generalizes without over-reaching (does not try to interpolate from the benchmark, nor reference unrelated information).

There are no errors, omissions, or unwarranted assertions. The answer is fully accurate and in line with the expected strict evaluation standard.
