The LLM answer fails catastrophically: it provides no valid single-hunk unified diff (instead offering fragmented, syntactically invalid, garbled pseudo-diffs with irrelevant commentary, HTML artifacts, and inconsistent change proposals like "P3D", "PD", or "PT***H" instead of the precise "P2D" change); the rationale is not a single coherent sentence but buried in rambling text; minor intent alignment (targeting the same task's dueDate) is overwhelmed by massive formatting violations, extraneous content, and non-applicable patches, rendering it unusable and non-compliant with all output rules.
