**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth: correct "Yes" for Q1, identical minimal sequence (T1→T2→T7→T4→T5), matching markings/step-by-step trace, and equivalent explanation (alternative path fills P5 while P2 token remains for T5, without T3 firing). Stylistic differences (table vs. list, minor wording) are superficial and do not alter content, correctness, or brevity (both ≤120 words). No errors.
