8.0  
- Q1 matches closely but adds unnecessary "distinct" (minor deduction for precision to ground truth).  
- Q2 is correct but overly verbose with extra explanatory text beyond conciseness required (significant deduction for deviation from minimal format).  
- Q3 is correct but adds superfluous phrasing ("appears exactly once"), violating strict conciseness (significant deduction).  
Overall, content is accurate, but formatting and brevity differ notably from ground truth, warranting a strict mid-high score.
