The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" to Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) matching the ground truth. The explanation accurately describes the enabling conditions for T5 using the untouched token in P2 and the path to P5, demonstrating T5 firing before T3. However, it omits explicit marking details (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}) and the post-firing effect (T5 consuming P2 and disabling T3), which adds confirmatory depth in the ground truth. These minor omissions in precision and completeness warrant a slight deduction under strict evaluation.
