9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth:  
- It correctly answers “Yes” to Q1 with appropriate reasoning.  
- The minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) matches the ground truth’s sequence.  
- The explanation is accurate and concise.

However, there is a minor issue in wording and presentation:  
- The LLM does not explicitly mention that after T5 fires, T3 is disabled (which is a subtle but important aspect highlighted in the ground truth).  
- The LLM’s explanation is slightly less formal/precise than the ground truth, particularly in not referencing markings after each step.

These are small, yet relevant omissions for a rigorous evaluation, hence a deduction. The answer is factually correct and logically sound, so 9.0/10.
