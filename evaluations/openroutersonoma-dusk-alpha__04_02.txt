4.0

Rationale:

- **R1:** Correct. The answer is fully compliant with the ground truth.
- **R2:** Incorrect. The LLM answer claims R2 is compliant, but misses that, with the Change_Request after approvals (event 4), a new Manager_Approval (event 8) is required before Ship_Goods; thus, the 2-day window resets. Shipping occurred before the new approval, violating the rule. Critical error.
- **R3:** Correct. Correctly flagged as violated.
- **R4:** Correct. Marked Not Applicable with correct justification.
- **R5:** Incorrect. The LLM says compliant, but both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before the new Manager_Approval after the Change_Request, violating the rule. Critical error.
- **R6:** Correct. Compliant and matches ground truth.
- **Overall result:** Correct.

**Summary of errors:**  
Two major rule assessments (R2 & R5) are incorrect, and these are critical process violations. The remaining rules are correctly assessed. The overall result is correct, but the misclassifications on R2 and R5 are fundamental as they demonstrate a misunderstanding of the temporal dependencies in the process.

**Strict deduction for each critical error:**  
Each violated rule mis-marked as compliant should result in significant deduction:
- R2: –2 points
- R5: –2 points
- (Small additional deduction for slightly weaker justifications compared to ground truth.)

Thus, the answer earns a **4.0** for correctly identifying the violations in R3, but substantial penalties for R2 and R5 misclassification.
