The LLM answer incorrectly assesses R2 as Compliant (should be Violated, as Ship_Goods precedes the final post-change approval by more than 2 days after that approval). It also incorrectly assesses R5 as Compliant (should be Violated, as Ship_Goods, Receive_Goods, and Pay_Invoice occur before the new Manager_Approval). These errors in status and justifications for two rules represent major deviations, despite correct handling of R1, R3, R4, and R6, and the overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion.
