7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes the exact average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim, avoids any mention of service times, throughput, or other activities, and stays under 150 words (approx. 120 words). It provides one action per activity, each logically tied to waiting-time issues and claiming a ≥20% reduction, with no invented unsupported data beyond the claim itself.

However, significant deductions for differences from the ground truth: (1) Actions are entirely different and less data-driven—lacking specifics like pilots, estimates, or metrics (e.g., ground truth cites "pilot tests show ≥25%" vs. LLM's generic "implement automated system"); (2) Format is a full memo with extraneous elements (subject, greetings, sign-off) rather than the concise, bullet-style structure; (3) Misses ground truth's verbatim phrasing and explicit data justifications, reducing concreteness. These deviations from the reference answer warrant a strict penalty despite factual accuracy.
