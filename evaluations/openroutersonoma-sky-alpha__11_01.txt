9.5

The LLM answer fully meets the prompt's requirements: it correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) using exact figures from the table (avg and 95th percentile, with units). No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities are mentioned. The memo is crisp (148 words), executive-style with appropriate header. Each recommendation is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time bottlenecks, data-driven (references execution volumes from the table), and specifies a ≥20% reduction with calculated post-action averages (e.g., 25% for #1, verifiable as 36.5 × 0.75 ≈ 27.4).

Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic differences from the ground truth (full memo format vs. ultra-concise bullet list; invented but plausible actions vs. ground truth's specific ones like "automated reminders"), though these do not violate correctness, relevance, or bounds. No errors in core content.
