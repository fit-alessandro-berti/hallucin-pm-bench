The LLM answer is highly accurate, matching the ground truth's core response: "Yes" for Q1, and the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) for Q2, which correctly demonstrates T5 firing before T3 without T3 occurring. Both explanations correctly note the alternative path enabling P5 while P2 remains available, bypassing T3's path.

Minor deductions for differences: LLM uses descriptive actions in the sequence (e.g., "splits into P1, P2") without markings (M₁, etc.), adds unrequested word count and parenthetical notes, and emphasizes "never fired" + "bypassing" without mentioning post-T5 disablement of T3. These are stylistic variances, not errors, but under strict criteria, they warrant a small loss. No factual inaccuracies.
