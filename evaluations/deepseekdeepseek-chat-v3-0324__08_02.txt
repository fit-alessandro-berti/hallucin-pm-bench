**Evaluation:**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3 (Q1 = "Yes") and provides a correct minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5), matching the ground truth. The explanation accurately notes that T3 doesn't need to fire, gives the reason in terms of token flow, and identifies the required places/markings for T5.

**Deductions:**
- The answer states “T3 is never fired in this sequence. T5 fires because P2 (from T1) and P5 (from T4) are available, bypassing T3.” This is a minor imprecision because, per the Petri net semantics, "bypassing T3" might be unclear to a non-expert (T3 is disabled after T5, but strictly, T3 could fire after T5 if re-enabled). However, in this case, after firing T5, P2 is consumed, so T3 cannot fire. The answer doesn’t explicitly discuss that T5 disables T3 moving forward; the ground truth does.
- The step-by-step marking evolution (e.g., M₁, M₂, etc.) as shown in the ground truth would have made the answer clearer and more precise.
- The explanation could have been slightly improved by mentioning explicitly that after T5, T3 is disabled, as in the ground truth.

**Conclusion:**  
The core reasoning and firing sequence match the ground truth precisely. The minor difference in explicitness and granularity around disabling T3 post-T5 results in a small deduction. Hence: **9.0**.
