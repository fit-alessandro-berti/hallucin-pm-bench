The LLM answer proposes an entirely different and invalid change (reversing `Flow_2` without ensuring flow connectivity, orphaning `Task_PrepareContract` and breaking process executability) compared to the ground truth (precise `dueDate` adjustment on `Task_CollectEquipment`); the diff hunk, modified element, and rationale all mismatch completely, violating the intent of matching the expected single valid SLA fix.
