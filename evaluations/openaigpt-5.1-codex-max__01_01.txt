**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**:
  - Correctly identifies core decision elements: eligibility in Triage (#1 partial match), amount threshold/high-value branch (#2 match), pre-approval in Finance (#3 partial), and payment precondition (captures constraint but miscategorized).
  - **Required documents**: Exact match (all 7 listed, with conditional note on *AuditTrail* similar to GT).
  - No introduction of undefined activities/artefacts (e.g., no legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide").

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences)**:
  - **Decision points**: Lists 4 items vs. GT's precise 3; uses unstructured bullets instead of table with explicit "#", "Branching logic / outcomes". Misses rejection paths (*Not eligible* → reject; *Rejected* → ends without payment). Adds undefined "gate" and "Payment execution requires..." phrasing, altering summary. Threshold not explicitly "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**". (-2.5 points)
  - **Structure/Completeness**: No table, no final note "(No other documents...)". Descriptive but not as tabular/precise. (-0.5 points)
  - **Minor phrasing**: "Signs off" implies but doesn't specify approval/rejection outcomes like GT. High-value bullet repeats process but lacks exact post-PreApprove timing. (-0.5 points)

Overall: Strong on documents (full credit), ~70% fidelity on decisions due to omissions, extras, and format gaps. Strict policy applied: differences in precision/branching = major loss.
