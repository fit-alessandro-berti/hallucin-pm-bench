**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Core Idea (Partial Credit, +3.0)**: Correctly identifies attaching a 48-hour interrupting timer boundary event to `Task_Receive` and routing directly to `Task_Triage` to bypass delays and meet SLA. References relevant IDs (`Task_Receive`, `Task_Triage`).
- **Major Errors (Severe Deduction, -4.0)**:
  - Introduces **incorrect BPMN concepts**: "Escalation signal" and "Escalation event" – timers do not fire escalations (that's a separate event type requiring escalation definitions); confuses mechanisms.
  - "Parallel flow" is wrong – interrupting boundary timers take a **direct sequence flow**, not parallel.
  - No precise BPMN syntax (e.g., `PT48H`, event ID `Timer_48h`, `<bpmn:timeDuration>`).
- **Minor Errors (Further Deduction, -1.5)**: Vague phrasing ("bypasses `Task_Check` and `GW_Docs`"); doesn't explicitly note "no new tasks—only timer and flow"; wordier than necessary.
- **Strengths (+0.7)**: Plain English, ≤120 words (~105), no new tasks.
- **Overall**: Good intent but critical BPMN inaccuracies make it unreliable for a "certified BPMN 2.0 architect"; significant deviations from ground truth justify low score under utmost strictness.
