The LLM answer is highly accurate in conclusion (correctly "No" due to Rule 3 violation), identifies the exact violation (NA before RA), and assesses all rules correctly. Justification references each rule with precise reasoning matching the trace and ruleset. Minor deductions for: (1) omission of explicit "once each" confirmation in Rule 1 assessment (ground truth states "QE appears once and precedes RA"), violating strict "once each" clause; (2) bullet format vs. ground truth's table (less structured); (3) slightly less verbose phrasing (e.g., no "Severity is High;" prefix in Rule 2, minor rephrasing in Rule 4). These small differences warrant point loss under utmost strictness, but core compliance analysis is near-identical.
