**Score: 9.4**

- **1. Count (1/1):** Correct—states "1 time (only in case C05)".
- **2. Percentages (2/2):** Correct—2.08% for events (1/48), 8.33% for cases (1/12). Calculations shown and numbers rounded as requested.
- **3. Explanation (6.4/7):**
  - (i) **Single-occurrence issue:** Yes—"appear rarely... only in case C05... sparse occurrences".
  - (ii) **Variance/instability:** Implicitly addressed—"results can be skewed", but does not explicitly mention statistical instability or how averages can be unreliable due to having just a single case.
  - (iii) **Over-generalization caution:** Yes—"If we generalise... results can be skewed... risks incorrect conclusions."

**Deduction:**  
A small reduction because the explanation, while clear, does not explicitly mention how a single observation introduces high variance or instability in performance/predictive models. It leans on "skewed" and "exceptional paths" (acceptable), but doesn't directly reference statistical unreliability as the ground truth does.

**Conclusion:**  
Nearly perfect; the answer is well-structured, only subtly lacking explicitness regarding statistical unreliability from single-event support.
