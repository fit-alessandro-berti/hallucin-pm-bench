The LLM answer is accurate on all quantitative elements (Q1-Q2), matching the ground truth exactly, including calculations and rounding. For Q3, the explanation is concise (68 words), addresses low support leading to skewed generalizations (e.g., performance metrics, cycle time, predictive models), and cautions against over-generalization with risks of incorrect conclusionsâ€”aligning with requirements (ii) and (iii). However, it omits explicit mention of the single-occurrence issue (i), generalizing to "rarely" and "sparse" without tying to the one instance, warranting a strict deduction for incompleteness.
