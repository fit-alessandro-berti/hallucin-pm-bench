3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Identification of three worst-performing activities (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: The prompt requires selection based *jointly* on SLA breaches *and* high waiting time. LLM correctly identifies Legal Approval (+300s breach, 600s wait) and Risk Review (+300s breach, 480s wait) as top two. However, it incorrectly selects Verify Identity (+30s breach, 80s wait) as third, ignoring Credit Assessment (+60s breach, 200s wait), which has higher breach and waiting time. This misanalysis of data leads to a fundamentally flawed core output, violating the "ground in data" rule and diverging sharply from ground truth.
  
- **Quantification of SLA excesses (moderate deduction: -1.5 points)**: LLM accurately states excesses for Legal (+300s) and Risk (+300s), but for Verify (wrong activity), it uses +30s. It adds unprovided percentages (e.g., 50%, 100%, 33%), which are invented metrics not in the table, breaching "no metrics not provided." Ground truth sticks to raw excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) without extras. Minor positives for including waiting times, but extras inflate invention.

- **Recommendations (moderate deduction: -1.0 points)**: Each provides one concrete action per activity, using bullets as required, and they are somewhat data-driven (e.g., tied to waiting/throughput). However, LLM's actions include inventions like "compress waiting time from 80 to 20 seconds" (unsubstantiated target) and embed bullets within activity descriptions, not as a standalone section like ground truth's "**Recommended actions**." Actions differ entirely (e.g., LLM's parallel workflows vs. ground truth's pre-checks), showing no alignment. Ground truth also invents (e.g., "€25k"), but LLM's for wrong activities compound the error.

- **Overall memo structure and adherence (minor positives offset by small deductions: net -0.0)**: Both are ~150 words, executive-style, and return only memo text. LLM adds unneeded header details (e.g., DATE, RE) and an impact sentence; ground truth includes total cases (4,805, derived from table sum ≈4,805 if cumulative). LLM mentions cases selectively (e.g., 480 for Risk), which is data-grounded but uneven. No absent activities/metrics overall, but cumulative inventions and wrong picks drag down.

This strict assessment penalizes the core analytical error heavily, as it invalidates half the memo's purpose. Partial credit for correct top two and basic format prevents a sub-3.0 score.
