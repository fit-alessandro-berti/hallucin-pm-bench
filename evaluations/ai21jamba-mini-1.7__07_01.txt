4.0

- The LLM correctly lists the two added tasks with accurate element names.
- It correctly records the gateway type change with accurate references.

Major error:
- It completely omits the removed task `<task id="send_rma_label" name="Send RMA Label"/>` which is present in v1 but not in v2. This is a significant miss for a factual, line-by-line XML difference evaluation.

Minor error:
- Formatting of headings differs from the ground truth (### vs **bold**), though this is less important as per instructions.

Due to the omission of a removed task, the response misses a core requirement and therefore should score no higher than 4.0.
