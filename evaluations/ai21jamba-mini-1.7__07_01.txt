4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (partial credit, ~3/5 points):** Correctly identifies the two added tasks (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`). However, the format violates instructions by quoting full XML elements (`<task id="..." name="..."/>`) instead of using element names/IDs as they appear (e.g., concise name and ID like ground truth). Headings use "###" instead of exact bullet-style "• Added tasks". Minor over-inclusion of XML syntax deducts points under strictness.
- **Removed tasks (0/5 points):** Major factual error—claims "(none)" but ground truth correctly identifies `send_rma_label` ("Send RMA Label") as removed (present in v1, absent in v2). This is a complete miss of a key difference, leading to significant deduction.
- **Gateway type changes (partial credit, ~2/5 points):** Correctly notes the change from exclusive to inclusive for `gw_valid`. However, format is incorrect: includes unnecessary full XML tags and name ("Warranty Valid?"), exceeding "factual differences... from the XML" and not matching ground truth's concise style (ID + types + versions). Heading mismatch as above.
- **Overall ( +1 bonus for structure adherence):** Response groups under headings and avoids speculation, but strict evaluation penalizes format deviations, over-quoting, and the critical omission of removed task. Total reflects ~50% accuracy with errors in precision and completeness.
