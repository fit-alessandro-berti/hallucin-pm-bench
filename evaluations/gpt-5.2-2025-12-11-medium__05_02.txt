**3.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Correct intent (partial credit)**: Identifies the same task (`Task_CollectEquipment`) and attribute (`camunda:dueDate`) as the ground truth, adhering to rules (no add/delete, one attribute mod).
- **Major diff format error (-3.0)**: Not a clean "single hunk" unified diff (e.g., no `@@` headers, uses `***`/`---` full-context style resembling `diff -c`, excessive lines shown).
- **Major content error (-2.0)**: Changes to `P1D` instead of exact `P2D`.
- **Rationale mismatch (-2.0)**: Different wording/content; misses "3-day SLA" reference, "keeps ... inside", and exact phrasing (though one sentence).
- Strictness applied: Cumulative differences exceed minor errors; only ~30% alignment justifies low score.
