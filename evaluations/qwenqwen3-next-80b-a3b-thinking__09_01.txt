10.0

The LLM answer receives a perfect score because it matches the ground truth both in conclusion and in the core reasoning:

- It clearly states the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the data provided.
- The answer explicitly mentions that timestamps and elapsed-time fields are missing, so duration cannot be determined.
- It notes that historical benchmarks from another segment are irrelevant.
- The answer does not fabricate values and correctly frames the impossibility of performing the computation.

There are no discrepancies or omissions when compared with the ground truth answer. The response is cautious, completely accurate, and includes a clear, concise explanation.
