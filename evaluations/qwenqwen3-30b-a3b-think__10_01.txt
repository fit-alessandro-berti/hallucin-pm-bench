The LLM answer correctly identifies the six activities using the mandated terminology ("KYC Review," "Order Vetting," "Payment Clearance") with proper capitalization and avoids all forbidden terms. It introduces no extra tasks, roles, or columns, and includes one Responsible (R) per activity, aligning minimally with the narrative's performers. However, it fails significantly in RACI completeness and accuracy compared to the ground truth:

- **Accountability (A) mismatches**: Assigns A solely to the Responsible party (e.g., CO for KYC Review, FC for Payment Clearance, IT for Record Update), but ground truth designates AM as A for KYC Review and Payment Clearance (while keeping CO/FC as R only). No A is shown for Record Update in ground truth, making the LLM's IT A unwarranted.
- **Missing Consulted (C) and Informed (I) entries**: All non-R/A cells are blank, ignoring ground truth's full matrix (e.g., no CO C / FC I / IT I for Receive Application; no AM A / FC C / IT I for KYC Review; no AM C / FC C for Record Update; no CO/FC/IT I for Notify Customer). This renders the matrix incomplete and non-representative of a standard RACI.
- **Formatting and presentation differences**: Uses abbreviated column headers (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") vs. ground truth's full names; separates R and A with commas instead of "R / A"; bolds all activities (vs. only mandated ones); adds an unrequested legend and note, introducing extraneous content.
- **Overall reflection of narrative**: While basic performers (R) match, the lack of inferred process flow (e.g., AM oversight, consultations) deviates from ground truth's detailed allocations, which better capture inter-role dependencies.

These errors—especially the incomplete RACI and misplaced A—result in substantial deviation, warranting a low score under strict evaluation.
