6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Terminology:**
- The LLM answer uses the required terms “KYC Review,” “Order Vetting,” and “Payment Clearance,” with correct spelling and capitalization.
- Forbidden variants do not appear. Full marks for strict terminology compliance.

**Structure:**
- All activities are present, mapping to six process steps.
- All four roles are columns, and activities are rows, as required.

**RACI Assignments:**

***Major Errors:***
- The LLM answer only assigns R, A, or both (R, A) to a single role per task.
  - This deviates significantly from the ground truth, where multiple roles may be marked as C (Consulted) or I (Informed) for the same activity.
  - The ground truth also distinguishes, in some cases, between A and R or assigns both (e.g., “R / A”) to a single person. LLM answers sometimes combine R and A, but fails to distribute C and I as in ground truth.
- The ground truth meaningfully assigns C and I to several roles per activity (e.g., for "Receive Application," CO = C, FC = I, IT = I), but the LLM answer omits almost all C and I designations.
- For “KYC Review,” ground truth: CO=R, AM=A, FC=C, IT=I. In LLM: CO=R,A. Does not distinguish A and misses C and I entirely.
- For “Order Vetting”: ground truth AM=R/A, CO=C, FC=I, IT=I; in LLM: AM=R,A; all other blanks.
- For other steps, the same pattern: only assigning main R/A, neglecting other involved roles.

***Other Errors:***
- The LLM legend is strictly correct, but the sentence “This matrix strictly adheres...” is not necessary, but not penalized.
- The LLM uses “R, A” designations together; ground truth uses “R / A,” but this is a minor style, not content, issue.

**Summary:**
- While the activity names and forbidden terms are correct, the RACI allocations differ substantially from the ground truth, omitting nearly all C and I marks and not following the more nuanced role allocation from the narrative.
- Strict scoring policy: The answer’s correctness on labeling is outweighed by insufficient RACI role granularity which is central to this task.

**Strict Score: 6.0** (On the high side of partial credit for terminology and structural accuracy, but significant functional deficits in RACI allocations as per the ground truth.)
