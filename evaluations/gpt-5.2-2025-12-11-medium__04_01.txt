7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correctly identifies "Non-compliant". Accurately detects and justifies the two critical violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event references (#4/#8/#9 for Rule 2; #6/#7/#8/#10 for Rule 3), matching ground truth wording and logic closely (e.g., Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods; Three_way_match exceeds distance ≤2).
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Incomplete analysis: Ignores Rules 1, 4, and 5 (all satisfied in ground truth), failing to provide exhaustive justification across **all** rules as in ground truth. This is a structural/content difference; "relevant rules" likely includes all per ground truth model.
  - No explicit distance calculation ("distance=3") for Rule 3 or summary statement ("overall **NON-COMPLIANT**" due to Rules 2 & 3).
  - Minor formatting gaps: No "Justification" header; violation list numbered as 1-2 (violations only) vs. ground truth's 1-5 (all rules).
- **Scoring**: 7.5 reflects ~80% alignment on core decision/violations (full credit there) but -2.5 for incompleteness/missing satisfied rules and details (strict penalty per instructions, as differences in comprehensiveness/content are evident and non-trivial). No factual errors, but not matching ground truth fidelity.
