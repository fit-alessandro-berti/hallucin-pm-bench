### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (partial credit, +1.0)**: The LLM correctly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") exactly as specified, with proper capitalization, and avoids all forbidden variants. No mentions of them occur elsewhere.
- **Structure and Format (partial credit, +1.0)**: It produces a basic RACI matrix with activities as rows and the four specified roles as columns. Includes a legend (unwarranted but not severely so). However, formatting deviates (e.g., "R, A" vs. ground truth's "**R / A**"; no bolding on mandated terms; extra note and reasoning text not in ground truth).
- **RACI Content (major deductions, -7.0)**: Severe inaccuracies in assignments, failing to match ground truth:
  - Misses all Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles across activities (e.g., ground truth has widespread C/I for CO, FC, IT in nearly every row; LLM uses only "-" for non-primary roles).
  - Incorrect Accountable (A) placements: LLM assigns A solely to the primary handler (e.g., CO for KYC Review, FC for Payment Clearance), ignoring AM's overarching A role in KYC Review and Payment Clearance. AM is correctly R/A only for its direct activities but under-assigned elsewhere.
  - Each row has exactly one R (matches ground truth criterion), but overall allocations do not "reflect the narrative" of implied collaboration and AM accountability.
  - For Notify Customer, internal reasoning mentions "Customer" as Informed (unwarranted, as Customer is not a role/column), but matrix ignores it entirely.
- **Unwarranted Content (minor deductions, -0.5)**: Includes explanatory reasoning, legend, and a closing noteâ€”none present in ground truth, adding extraneous material.
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the core RACI assignments are fundamentally mismatched (only ~30% alignment per row on average), representing small-to-large errors in every activity. This overrides terminology accuracy, as the matrix's purpose (accurate role mapping) fails. No self-awareness issues apply.
