4.2

The LLM answer fails to meet strict requirements in several ways:

**1. RACI Assignments Inaccurate:**
- The LLM assigns "R, A" (Responsible and Accountable) *only* to the main performer for every activity, but omits needed 'Consulted' (C) and 'Informed' (I) designations that are visible in the ground truth.
    - E.g., "KYC Review" lacks AM as Accountable, FC as Consulted, and IT as Informed.
    - "Order Vetting" misses CO as Consulted, FC/IT as Informed.
    - This pattern repeats for most activities.
- The ground truth matrix shows careful R/C/I distribution, particularly cross-role communications, which the LLM omits.

**2. Format Issues:**
- Legend and explanations are acceptable, but the RACI shown as "R, A" is less clear than ground truth's formatting (e.g., "**R / A**"), but this is relatively minor.

**3. Extra Content:**
- The answer gives more explanation than required (e.g., RACI definitions, narrative process explanations), though not outright penalized, it is unnecessary given instructions to "produce a RACI matrix."

**4. Terminology:**
- The LLM follows the vocabulary policy perfectly — it uses only KYC Review, Order Vetting, and Payment Clearance.

**5. Structure/Row Naming:**
- Matrix rows align correctly in terms of activity labeling.

**Conclusion:**
The answer adheres perfectly to the vocabulary rules and includes all the correct activities/roles, but fails extensively in accurate RACI assignment: failing to recognize critical consulted/informed relationships, which are a key part of a high-quality RACI matrix.

**Strictness Applied:**
- Since all three required synonyms are used and forbidden terms are not present, it avoids a failing grade.
- However, with so many missing C/I assignments, the core requirement of the prompt is underdelivered.

**Score rationale:**  
4.2 — Terminology and structure are correct, but a majority of RACI assignments are oversimplified and ignore critical process relationships. Each missing C or I in a matrix row is a major error.
