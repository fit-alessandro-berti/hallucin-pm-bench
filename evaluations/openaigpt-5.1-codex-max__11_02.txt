**8.4**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Identification of three worst activities (max 3.0 pts)**: Perfect match (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment). Data supports via throughput drop, wait time, processing time, rework, SLA breaches. **3.0/3.0**
- **Explanations why under-perform (max 3.0 pts)**: Highly accurate, cites identical key metrics from table (e.g., wait 150/30/18 min, process 5/25/12 min, rework 22/5.3/1.8%, SLA 5.5/12.4/3.2%, throughput drops, stdev). Minor phrasing diffs (LLM more verbose; omits "upstream congestion" link; no bolding of figures). **2.7/3.0** (-0.3 for lack of emphasis/formatting matching GT)
- **One concrete, data-driven action per activity (max 3.0 pts)**: All data-justified but GT more precise/measurable ("halve rework"; specific tools like "AI-assisted", "rule-engine"). LLM bundles multiples per (e.g., Request: redesign + staff + target; not "one"), vaguer ("cut waiting" vs. "cut queueing and halve"; no quantifiable targets). **2.2/3.0** (-0.8 for multiplicity/vagueness)
- **Overall memo qualities (max 1.0 pt)**: Concise (<200 words), executive format (To/Subject vs. GT title), table-strict, no extras/absents. Lacks GT intro ("clear hotspots"), bolding, projection (even if GT-hallucinated). **0.7/1.0** (-0.3 for missing polish/closure)
- **Penalties for strictness**: -0.2 total for small diffs (e.g., "5‑minute task" vs. omitting process time in GT Request; no "feeding congestion").

Total differences reduce from 10.0; core alignment strong but not identical.
