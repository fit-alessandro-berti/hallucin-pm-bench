The LLM answer correctly identifies all key factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway) without speculation or errors in content, aligning with the prompt's requirements for exact XML-derived facts and headings. However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for: (1) listing only task IDs without including the corresponding names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" for check_vip), which the ground truth provides as part of the factual XML details, representing incomplete reporting; (2) minor formatting variances in list items (- vs. *) and lack of explicit version labels ((v1)/(v2)); (3) absence of the ground truth's closing note, though not strictly required by the prompt. These small but noticeable omissions in detail and style result in a deduction, but the core accuracy remains high.
