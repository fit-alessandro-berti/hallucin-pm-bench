### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Perfect match. The top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability) are correctly identified and ranked. Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5 h and 120.0 h for #1). No service times, throughput, or extraneous activities mentioned. (+10/10)
- **Format and Constraints**: Crisp memo style under 150 words (~110 words). Includes subject line and clear structure. Adheres strictly to waiting-time focus. Minor deduction for slightly more verbose phrasing compared to ground truth's ultra-concise list format, which feels more "executive crisp." (-0.3)
- **Actions**: All three are concrete, logically tied to waiting-time bottlenecks (e.g., reminders for document delays, batching for closure waits, triage for assessment queues), and explicitly target ≥20% reduction via P95 calculations (e.g., 120.0 × 0.8 = 96.0 h). Data-driven in using the provided metrics for targets. However, actions differ in specifics from ground truth (e.g., LLM's Day 3/7 reminders vs. 24h escalation; daily batch vs. e-signature replacement; desk triage vs. rules-engine). While relevant and compliant, these variations introduce differences without identical grounding (e.g., no "pilot tests" or "estimated" claims, but strictness penalizes non-matching proposals as deviations).

Overall, the response is highly compliant and effective, with only phrasing/action wording as minor differences warranting a small deduction under utmost strictness.
