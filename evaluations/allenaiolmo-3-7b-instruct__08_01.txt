8.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correctness of core answer (major weight)**: Perfect match on "Yes" conclusion (+2.0), exact firing sequence enabling T5 before T3 (T1 → T2 → T5, with p3=1, p4=0) (+2.0), and accurate enabling condition (p3≥1 ∧ p4=0) (+1.5). Markings simulated correctly in final sequence.
- **Justification quality**: Good explanation of post-T1/T2 enabling and inhibitor role (+1.5), but misses ground truth's key insight that T5 is *permanently disabled after T3* (p4 never resets alone; only via T4 with p3) (-0.5). Lacks "must fire before if ever" nuance.
- **Structure & clarity**: Rambling with initial wrong conclusion ("No... first time p3≥1 is after T3"), mid-simulation errors (e.g., wrong post-T4 p3 state; "T5 after T3" detour), and self-correction (-1.0). Verbose vs. ground truth's concise polish. No markings in justification like ground truth.
- **Completeness**: Sequence stops post-T5 (sufficient for "before T3"), but ground truth extends to T3/T4 for fuller demo (-0.2). Minor restatements/repetitions (-0.1).
- **Strictness adjustment**: Internal errors/contradictions (even corrected) are "small errors" warranting "significant loss" (-0.5 total). No fabrication or misunderstanding of net.

**Total derivation**: 10.0 base for perfect -1.8 deductions = 8.2. High due to usable final answer/sequence; not 10.0 due to messy process deviating from ground truth's precision.
