1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, incorrectly concluding "No" with a flawed proof of impossibility, while the ground truth establishes "Yes" with a valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3). It overlooks the reachable marking after T1 and T2 where p3=1 and p4=0, enabling T5 before T3. This core error in analysis, sequence identification, and justification results in zero alignment with the ground truth, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
