The LLM answer provides all three sets of concurrently executable tasks for Process B, matching the grouping and wording of the ground truth answer. However, it uses bullet points instead of the requested numbered lines (as explicitly instructed: "Return your answer as numbered lines"), which is a formatting error. This formatting deviation reflects a significant loss of points as per the instruction for strictness, lowering the score. The content otherwise matches perfectly, so the deduction is only for format, not substance.
