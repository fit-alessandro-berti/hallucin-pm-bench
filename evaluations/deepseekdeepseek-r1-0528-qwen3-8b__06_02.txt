The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks with the exact tasks in each, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it deviates from the specified format by using bullet points (*) instead of numbered lines (1., 2., 3.), and includes an unnecessary introductory sentence ("Here is the parallel execution structure for Process B:"), which adds extraneous text not present in the ground truth. These format inconsistencies warrant a deduction despite the accurate substance.
