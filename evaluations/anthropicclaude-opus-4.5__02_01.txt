**10.0**

The LLM answer provides exactly the correct JSON matching the ground truth in content, structure, order, values, and format (including unsorted Q5 list and precise timestamp). All facts are directly derived from the log (e.g., distinct cases, per-case time-sorted sequences for precedence/first events, event counts, min timestamp). No fabrications, inferences beyond log data, or errors. Extra explanatory text demonstrates meticulous analysis as per the hidden system role but does not alter or contradict the required JSON output; the prompt specifies returning answers "in exactly this JSON schema" (which it does verbatim at the end) without prohibiting reasoning. Under strict evaluation, zero differences in the assessable answer components (the JSON), so perfect score.
