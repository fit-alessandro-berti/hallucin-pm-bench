The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as Non-compliant and accurately pinpoints the exact same two rule violations (Rules 2 and 3) as the ground truth, with precise event citations and correct reasoning for both. No factual errors or hallucinations. Rule 2 justification matches perfectly (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods). Rule 3 justification is descriptively accurate ("four activities later" aligns with exceeding "next two activities," equivalent to ground truth's "distance=3").

However, strict deductions for:
- **Incompleteness (-1.0)**: Does not systematically evaluate *all* 5 rules as ground truth does (omits explicit confirmation of satisfied Rules 1, 4, 5), reducing thoroughness despite correctness.
- **Structural/format differences (-0.5)**: Numbered list only covers violations (1-2 vs. ground truth's 1-5 per rule); uses bolded "**Violation of Rule X**" headers and "**Non-compliant**" instead of plain "Non-compliant" + "Justification" header + per-rule "Satisfied/Violated" + summary sentence.

Overall, highly accurate on core decision and violations but lacks ground truth's exhaustive, structured per-rule analysis.
