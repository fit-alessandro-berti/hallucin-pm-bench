### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (full marks)**: LLM correctly answers **YES**, provides a **valid, minimal concrete firing sequence** (T1 → T2 → T5) matching the prompt's requirement, with accurate markings and inhibitor arc explanation. No factual errors; superior to ground truth's erroneous extension (T4 impossible post-T3 without p3 token).
- **Completeness**: Sequence and brief justification sufficient. Captures enabling condition precisely (p3≥1 ∧ p4=0 requires T2 but not T3).
- **Differences causing deductions** (-0.5 total, significant per strictness rule):
  - Misses ground truth's deeper insight ("must fire before T3 if ever to occur"; permanent disablement post-T3 via inhibitor + T4 semantics) – lacks proof-like justification of *exclusivity* (small omission, major impact).
  - Explicitly notes "T3 never fires in this sequence" – technically correct but differs from ground truth's demonstration of T3 *after* T5 (potentially pedantic; strict reading favors showing both for "before").
  - Verbose structure (observations, headings) vs. ground truth's concise format – unnecessary elaboration.
  - No matching phraseology (e.g., no "enabled because p3 ≥1 ∧ p4=0"; minor wording variances in markings/notation).
- **Overall**: Near-perfect match on core (answer + sequence + basic justify), but strict difference penalty for depth/style lowers from 10.0.
