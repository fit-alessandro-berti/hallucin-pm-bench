8.5

- **Q1 Evaluation:** Minor deductions for incorrect casing (lowercase 'c' instead of uppercase 'C') and non-matching order of cases (c456, c123, c789 vs. C123, C456, C789), despite correct count of 3; this deviates from exact ground truth formatting and precision.
- **Q2 Evaluation:** Exact match to ground truth ("Pack_Items").
- **Q3 Evaluation:** Exact match to ground truth ("Cancel_Order").
- **Overall:** Strong accuracy on content (all substantive answers correct), but strict penalties applied for Q1's small but noticeable inconsistencies in presentation, per evaluation criteria.
