### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: the three added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), the one removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change from exclusive to inclusive. No incorrect changes are introduced, and it adheres to the three required headings without mentioning ignored elements like renamings (e.g., task names or gateway labels).

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting and structure differences (significant deduction: -1.0)**: Uses "### Changes Summary" intro (absent in ground truth), "####" subheadings (vs. "*" bolded headings), bullet lists (vs. numbered), and bolded IDs (vs. name-first with `(ID)`). Ground truth ends with a confirmatory note, which LLM lacks.
- **Content presentation mismatches (significant deduction: -0.3)**: Lists tasks primarily by ID (vs. ground truth's name-first priority, e.g., "Verify Identity (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"). Includes unrequested positional/flow descriptions (e.g., "between Start and Review Application"), adding interpretive details not in the strict summary requirement or ground truth.
- **Gateway details omission (moderate deduction: -0.2)**: Specifies "Exclusive â†’ Inclusive" but omits BPMN-standard acronyms (XOR/OR) and version references (v1/v2), reducing precision compared to ground truth.

Core accuracy is high (no factual errors, all changes covered), but small deviations in strict adherence to ground truth's concise, name-focused style warrant deductions. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply.
