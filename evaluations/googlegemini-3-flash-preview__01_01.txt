8.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: 
  - Covers **all 7 required documents** exactly matching the ground truth list, including the conditional note on *AuditTrail*. No extras introduced, accurate usages described without violating "do not introduce artefacts."
  - Identifies core decision points accurately: eligibility (triage), pre-approval (finance), threshold branch, and auditor review. Captures branching logic implicitly (e.g., high-value routing, progression to payment).
  - No introduction of undefined activities (e.g., no "CustomerService_Agent_Decide") or artefacts. Faithful to process description and constraints.

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Number/structure of decision points**: Lists 4 points vs. ground truth's precise 3 (combining approvals into "final payment approval"). Splits GT #3 unnecessarily; adds "System/Process Logic" framing for threshold (minor invention). No table format; lacks explicit branching/outcomes (e.g., no "*Eligible* → continue; *Not eligible* → rejected" or equivalents for all). Descriptive names like "Eligibility Validation" deviate from GT's exact activity-linked phrasing (e.g., "*Eligibility check* during **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**").
  - **Small interpretive additions**: "flight status and external conditions" infers document contents not stated in process (FlightManifest/WeatherReport only mentioned as check targets) – small error, but significant point loss per instructions.
  - **Phrasing/precision**: Looser summaries without GT's tabular rigor or explicit reject paths/end states. Added descriptive preambles/usages for documents (e.g., "Submitted by the passenger," "Generated and sent") – accurate but extraneous vs. GT's plain numbered list.
  - **Overall format**: Headers/sections/bullets vs. GT's table + list + footnote. Intro sentence unnecessary.

Net: Excellent content coverage (90%+ match), but structural, count, phrasing, and minor invention differences warrant deductions from 10.0. Equivalent to ~80% fidelity under utmost strictness.
