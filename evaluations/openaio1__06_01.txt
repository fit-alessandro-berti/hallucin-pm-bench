The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs of parallel tasks from Process B (Create_Documentation with Quality_Check, and Procure_Materials with Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order both within pairs and overall, and outputs one pair per line. However, it deviates slightly from the specified format by lacking the two spaces after each first task name before the em dash (e.g., "Create_Documentation —" instead of "Create_Documentation  —") and does not align the em dashes vertically with additional leading spaces on the second line, as shown in the ground truth. These are minor formatting inconsistencies, but under strict evaluation, they warrant a deduction despite the substantive accuracy.
