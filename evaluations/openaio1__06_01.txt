6.0

The LLM answer has captured the correct pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel according to the process description. However, it significantly deviates from the required formatting:

- It omits the precise spacing/alignment from the ground truth (the ground truth uses double spaces and left-aligns task names for easier scannability).
- It does not follow the exact output format (“Task_X  —  Task_Y” with double spaces on both sides of the em dash).
- The instruction to print "one pair per line" in the *specified* format is ignored: the LLM uses a single space on both sides of the dash, instead of the required formatting.
- The list is in the correct order, and the content is fully correct, but failure to meet strict formatting requirements, as explicitly specified, is a significant error.

Therefore, despite the content being fully correct, the response suffers a heavy penalty for not following precise formatting, per the instructions for strict grading.
