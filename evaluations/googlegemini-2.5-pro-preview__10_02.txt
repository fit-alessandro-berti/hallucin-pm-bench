3.0

- **Role Coverage:** The LLM answer omits the **Operations Manager** role entirely and only sparsely references **IT Support** (only in task descriptions, not in columns), while the Ground Truth clearly includes both as explicit columns. This is a major departure.
- **Mandatory Wording:** It adheres to the mandated wording for the roles present (Transaction Analyst/Regulatory Liaison), but missing mandated KYC Review as an explicit task name (the ground truth titles it "KYC Review," not "Perform KYC Review (Sender & Beneficiary)"). Also, "Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission" and "Archive Case File" are not strictly adhering to "Archive Record".
- **Task Definition and Completeness:** Task breakdown and phrasing differ: 
  - "Log Customer Transfer Instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction" (not a strict synonym per the prompt).
  - "Approve High-Risk Transaction" is singular, ground truth plural, but this is minor.
  - "Release Payment" and "Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission" conflate two separate actors in ground truth; in the prompt, release and messaging are distinct responsibilities.
- **Accountabilities/Assignments:** 
  - Multiplicity of R/A: The answer lists both Responsible and Accountable on several tasks for one role (e.g. Transaction Analyst), whereas RACI best practice and the ground truth shows that A should be unique per task.
  - Consulted/Informed relationships are missing or incorrect (e.g. Transaction Analyst is listed as "Informed" for high-risk transaction approval, which does not match ground truth), and no "Consulted" or "Informed" entries for IT Support/Operations Manager.
- **Formatting:** Table structure includes only two roles, missing two out of four required columns.

**Summary:**  
While the LLM answer uses mandated terms for present roles and avoids forbidden synonyms, it omits two critical roles entirely and misrepresents several task assignments, breaking strict RACI standards and the requirements of the ground truth. Several tasks are not clearly mapped with mandated vocabulary, and RACI designations are not tight. Even with some correct usage, these are fundamental errorsâ€”thus, only a 3.0.
