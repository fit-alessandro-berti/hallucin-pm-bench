**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically on nearly every criterion with utmost strictness applied:

- **Wrong table structure**: Rows mix roles and one activity haphazardly; columns are R/A/C/I (user-facing) instead of activities (rows) vs. roles (columns). No bolding (e.g., **R,A**), uses invalid "None"/"All"/dashes inconsistently vs. ground truth's –.
- **Incomplete/missing activities**: Covers only "KYC Review" (one mandated term); omits **Intake Vetting**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**, **Compliance Officer Approval**, **Release Funds**. Does not cover "every activity" without renaming/merging/adding.
- **Violates vocabulary policy**: Fails to use all four mandated terms exactly; no "Intake Vetting", "AML Screening", or "Risk Scoring". While avoiding some synonyms, it does not adhere to "only authorized vocabulary" for full coverage.
- **Incorrect RACI assignments**: Fabricated/nonsensical (e.g., roles as "activities"; "Treasury Ops" informed "All"). No match to ground truth logic.
- **Extra invalid content**: Unrequested note claiming adherence (false).
- **No alignment to process narrative/ground truth**: Zero substantive overlap in content, format, or fidelity.

Even minor partial credit (e.g., one correct term, role names) is outweighed by total deviation; score reflects complete non-compliance.
