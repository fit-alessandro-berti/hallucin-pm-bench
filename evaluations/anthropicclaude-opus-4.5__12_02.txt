The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in identifying the correct "No" verdict and the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 reversal; C005 lacking Receive_Order at line 11), with precise citations to lines and cases. It adheres strictly to a single-paragraph justification as prompted. Minor deductions for small extraneous details not in ground truth—specific timestamps (accurate but unneeded) and mention of "Cancel_Order" in C005 (accurate but adds unprompted log detail)—introduce slight differences in phrasing and content length, warranting a strict but minimal point loss under utmost scrutiny. Wording variations (e.g., "inaccurate" vs. "false"; "does not always follow" phrasing) and paragraph vs. bulleted structure are present but do not alter factual accuracy or completeness.
