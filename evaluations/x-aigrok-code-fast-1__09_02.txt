The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility due to missing timestamps and provides a concise explanation, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning. However, it deducts a point for being slightly less precise: it generalizes to "cycle times" without specifying the activity or elaborating on the absence of start-to-completion intervals and event counts only, making it marginally less comprehensive under strict evaluation.
