**6.5**

### Rationale:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). +5.0
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Concise (<120 words) and data-grounded on small sample/non-representative nature (+2.5), but major differences from ground truth: lacks quantification (14 events/3 cases/<2hrs), statistical precision (0-7% swing, confidence interval, rare-event sampling error), and key data-specific insight (near-synonyms like “Automatic Fraud Check”/“Fraud Check (Automatic)” causing string/fuzzy matching distortion). Generic explanation misses analytical depth; minor speculation on full-log variations. +1.5 total for Q2.
- Overall: Solid basics but significant omissions in rigor/specificity per strict criteria.
