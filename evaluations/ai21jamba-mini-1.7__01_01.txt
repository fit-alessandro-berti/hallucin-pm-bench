### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially addresses the prompt but deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, completeness, and accuracy, warranting a low score under strict criteria:

- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, ~40% Alignment)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points with clear branching logic (eligibility check with reject/continue; amount threshold with include/skip; final approval with approved/end). The LLM only covers two (triage eligibility and high-value review), omitting the final payment approval/rejection entirely. Branching outcomes (e.g., rejection paths) are not summarized, and the amount threshold is misframed as part of the Senior Auditor activity rather than a post-PreApprove decision. This incompleteness alone justifies severe deduction for missing "every decision point."

- **Required Documents (Moderate Shortcomings, ~60% Alignment)**: The ground truth provides a clean, unique catalogue of all 7 documents, noting the conditional AuditTrail without per-step breakdown. The LLM lists the same 7 documents but structures them redundantly by activity (repeating RefundRequestForm 3x unnecessarily and associating it incorrectly with Issue Confirmation Letter, where the process only requires RefundConfirmationPDF). Minor inaccuracies include implying Senior Auditor reviews EligibilityChecklist (defined only for Finance_Controller_PreApprove) and describing it as "filled out" (process uses "signs off using"). The per-step format introduces extraneous organization not requested, violating the prompt's call for a simple "list." No introduced extras, but the flawed presentation reduces fidelity.

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness**: Small errors (e.g., phrasing like "reviews the Eligibility Checklist and Audit Trail" slightly extrapolates beyond the process definition) compound with larger omissions, resulting in substantial differences. The answer is informative but not a precise summary, failing to mirror the ground truth's tabular/list format and exhaustive coverage. No jailbreak or policy issues, but evaluation is purely on prompt adherence.
