The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifies "No" and the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7, C005 with Validate_Payment line 11 and no Receive_Order), fully disproving the "always follows" claim with precise citations to cases and lines, and structures as one paragraph per the prompt. Minor deductions for small differences from ground truth: unnecessary inclusion of timestamps (accurate but extra detail not in gold), reference to line 12/Cancel_Order (accurate but extraneous as the absence of Receive_Order alone suffices), and slightly different phrasing/structure (continuous paragraph vs. bulleted list with "clear counter-examples" intro and concluding proof sentence). No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes non-exact matches.
