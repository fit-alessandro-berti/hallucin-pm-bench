10.0

A1: Correct — 3 (matches the ground truth exactly).
A2: Perfect — "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" (matches ground truth exactly).
A3: Perfect — "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" in alphabetic order, matches exactly (ignoring underscore formatting, which can be considered a negligible typo given XML names versus text clarity).

There are no extra, missing, or fabricated elements. All factual content is present and ordered correctly. Any omission or spelling/case/formatting difference is minimal and does not constitute a content error per prompt guidance.

Final score: 10.0
