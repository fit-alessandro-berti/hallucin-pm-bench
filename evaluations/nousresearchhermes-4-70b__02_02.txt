The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth across all questions. Q1 is exact (3 distinct cases: C001, C002, C003). Q2 correctly lists the full sequence for C002 (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order), with no omissions or additions. Q3 accurately identifies the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery from C002; Check_Stock from C001 and C003), listed alphabetically one per line with no extras or hallucinations. Minor formatting variations (e.g., no bullets in A3) do not constitute errors, as the prompt specifies only "one per line, alphabetically ordered," which is satisfied.
