The LLM answer correctly identified both pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel:

1. Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines
2. Quality_Check — Create_Documentation

However, there are significant formatting issues when compared to the ground truth and specific instructions:

- The ground truth required **alphabetical order within each pair**. In the LLM answer, the second pair is given as "Quality_Check — Create_Documentation" rather than "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" (Create_Documentation comes before Quality_Check alphabetically).
- There is no guarantee that alphabetization is consistent "in your overall list" as required, but in this particular case the order still matches (Procure_Materials/Schedule_Machines is after Create_Documentation/Quality_Check alphabetically), so the penalty is mostly for within-pair order.
- The answer presented the results as a bulleted/numbered list rather than strictly one pair per line in the specified `Task_X  —  Task_Y` format (with consistent spacing).

On task comprehension, the LLM is fully accurate. However, because the task strongly and clearly emphasized format and strictness, and there was a (repeated) error in pair ordering and slight format deviation, this warrants a notable loss of points.

**Summary of deductions:**
- -2.0 points: Wrong within-pair alphabetical order.
- -1.0 point: Formatting did not follow exact line/output specification.

Total: **7.0**
