8.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in identifying the three correct activities—Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment—quantifying by how much each exceeds its SLA, and highlighting waiting times. It is concise, data-grounded, and does not invent metrics or refer to activities outside the table.

Points lost:

- The recommendations in the LLM answer are generic (focus on reducing waiting times) and are not as concrete or data-driven as in the ground truth, which specifies operational/process changes (e.g., introducing rule-based pre-checks, adding a risk analyst, automating score retrieval, and implementing a straight-through heuristic).
- The LLM answer does not provide a projected impact (“reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35 %”, “restore SLA compliance”) that is present in the ground truth.
- Minor differences in structure: e.g., not explicitly mentioning the total case count analyzed, and slightly less precision in wording.
- Minor issue: case wording/percent calculation (“67%” vs exact fraction not clearly specified in ground truth, but clearly grounded in data).

Overall, the LLM answer meets most requirements but lacks the actionable specificity and impact assessment of the ground truth answer.

Strictly, given the concrete, actionable nature of the ground truth’s recommendations and the more generic suggestions from the LLM, this warrants a 2-point deduction, resulting in an 8.0.
