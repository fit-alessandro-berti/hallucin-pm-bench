The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely across all questions: Q1 is correctly "3"; Q2 provides the exact sequence without deviations (underscores in ground truth appear to be Markdown escaping and do not constitute a substantive difference); Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors alphabetically, one per line, with no additions, omissions, or errors. Explanatory content does not detract from the factual accuracy of the final answers, which align verbatim with the expected outputs.
