The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth answer for all three questions:

- Q1: Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases.
- Q2: Lists the activities for case "C002" in the correct sequence, using the required "â†’" separator.
- Q3: Correctly determines and alphabetizes the distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" across all cases (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), and presents each on its own line as requested.

There are no factual or formatting errors, hallucinations, or omissions. The answer is clear, structured, and faithful to all prompt requirements.
