9.5

The LLM answer is very close to perfect. It accurately identifies all the added and removed tasks and summarizes the gateway-type change. The only minor deviation is the order of information (description format—`id` and name order reversed compared to the ground truth) and a slightly less formal presentation (does not specify "XOR" → "OR" in the gateway-type change—uses "exclusiveGateway" → "inclusiveGateway" and omits the clarifying parentheticals "(XOR)/(OR)"). Also, it omits clarifying which version the change occurred in ("in v1", "in v2").

Given your instruction for "utmost strictness" and that "also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," a 0.5-point deduction is warranted for these slight omissions in technical detail and formal precision.

**Breakdown:**
- Correct tasks added/removed: ✓
- Correct gateway-type change: ✓
- Format and completeness: Minor omissions in format/notation and version referencing, but all substantive changes present.

**Final score: 9.5**
