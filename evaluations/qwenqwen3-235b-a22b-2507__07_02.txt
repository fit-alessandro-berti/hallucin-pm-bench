9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies all required changes (added: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject; removed: Reject Loan; gateway: exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision) with no factual errors or omissions, adhering to the prompt's instruction to ignore renamings (e.g., task names, gateway labels). It covers exactly the three headings without extras.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Format inconsistencies** (significant deduction potential): Uses bullet points (-) and bold headings with ID-first listing (e.g., "Task_VerifyIdentity ("Verify Identity")"), while ground truth uses numbered lists, name-first bolding (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"), and italicized version references. This deviates from the ground truth's structure, warranting a -1.0 deduction.
- **Minor detail gaps**: Gateway change lacks explanatory acronyms (XOR/OR) and explicit v1/v2 versioning from ground truth; no closing note on completeness. These are small but reflect incomplete fidelity to the ground truth's phrasing, deducting -0.5 total.
- No over- or under-reporting; ignores non-relevant changes perfectly.

Overall, content excellence (full accuracy) yields a high score, tempered by presentation mismatches.
