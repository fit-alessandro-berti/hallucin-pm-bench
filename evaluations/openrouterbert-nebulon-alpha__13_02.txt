**1.0**

The provided LLM answer is entirely non-responsive gibberish ("y y y ..." repeated), failing to address any of the three questions. It matches zero elements of the ground truth: no count (1), no percentages (2.08%, 8.33%), and no explanation of low-support issues (single occurrence, variance/instability, over-generalization risks). Complete deviation warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
