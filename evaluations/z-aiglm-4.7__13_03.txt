7.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Perfect match (exact count "1"). +5.0
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Under 120 words ✓. Correctly identifies small sample (3 cases, <2 hours) and sampling bias/volatility ✓. Good on overestimation risk (33% per-case frequency).  
  Major deductions for:  
  - Omits critical ground-truth point on near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing string-matching distortion (fuzzy vs. strict) – key to misestimation (-1.5).  
  - Uses per-case % (33%) vs. ground truth's per-event swing (0-7%, confidence interval) (-0.5).  
  - Lacks precise sample stats (14 events) and "one extra/missing line" volatility quantification (-0.3).  
  Speculative elements ("high volume/risk triggers") minor deviation from "no speculation" but not vs. GT. Subtotal: +2.6/5.0.  
**Total: 7.6/10 → 7.2 strict-adjusted for omissions.**
