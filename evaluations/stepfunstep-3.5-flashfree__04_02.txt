**8.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth on format, status for R1, R3, R4, R5, R6, and overall result. Justifications are concise (≤20 words) and accurate where status is correct. Major deduction for R2: incorrect **Compliant** status (should be **Violated**) and flawed justification (ignores Change_Request triggering new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07 as the last required approval, making Ship_Goods on 03-05 non-compliant). This misses critical rule interaction (R2+R5), warranting significant points loss under strict criteria despite 5/6 rules correct.
