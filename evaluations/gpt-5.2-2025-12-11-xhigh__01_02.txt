**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision points (major errors, ~50% weight)**: Ground truth lists **exactly 3 precise decision points** with specific contextual positioning (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") and concise phrasing. LLM incorrectly expands to **5 points**, adding non-decision steps (Quick KYC Verification, Neighbourhood Feedback Check) not identified as such in ground truth. Overlapping points lack exact context/positioning, have different structure (bullets/sub-bullets vs numbered), and minor phrasing diffs (e.g., capitalization in MBA: "Approve/Reject" vs "approve/reject"). This introduces extraneous content and omits key qualifiers → severe deduction (-4.0 pts).
- **Required documents (~50% weight)**: Lists all **6 items** correctly by name, but phrasing mismatches ground truth (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)" vs "(≤ 3 months)"; "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "(CIS) template" vs "(CIS)"). Structure differs (bold/numbered vs plain), omits ground truth's explanatory note. Minor but per strictness rules, significant loss (-1.0 pt).
- **Overall**: High fidelity on core details/content where overlapping, but structural deviations, extras, omissions, and phrasing inconsistencies prevent higher score. No complete match.
