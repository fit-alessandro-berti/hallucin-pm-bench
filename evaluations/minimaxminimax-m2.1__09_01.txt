The LLM answer perfectly aligns with the ground truth in substance, conclusion, and reasoning: both clearly state the value cannot be derived/computed due to missing timestamps/durations, adhering strictly to the system instruction. Minor phrasing differences ("cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; explicit count of 4 cases and benchmark reference) are accurate enhancements supported by the data, not errors, adding analytical depth without fabrication. No deviations, omissions, or inaccuracies under utmost strictness.
