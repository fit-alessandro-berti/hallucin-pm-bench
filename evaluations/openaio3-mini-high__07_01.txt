7.0

• Added tasks  
- The answer correctly lists "check_vip" and "generate_qr" as added tasks, using the correct element names (ids), but omits their user-visible names (which appear in the XML and the ground truth):  
    - Missing: "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"  
    - Missing: "Generate RMA QR Code (id = `generate_qr`)"  
    This is a significant factual omission.

• Removed tasks  
- Correctly lists "send_rma_label" as a removed task by id, but does not include the name "Send RMA Label (id = `send_rma_label`)", as present in the XML and required by ground truth. Again, missing the name (even though not strictly required by the prompt, the ground truth expects it, and the prompt says “element names exactly as they appear in the XML”, which could refer to both `id` and `name`). Minor but recurring issue.

• Gateway type changes  
- Correctly identifies the id and the precise change in element type for "gw_valid". Slightly less formal phrasing than ground truth ("was defined as" instead of "changed from...to"), but factually correct.

Summary: The answer is very close to correct and accurate, but loses significant points for not including the task names where the ground truth does, as well as minor phrasing differences and lack of explicit formatting (asterisks, parentheses). No extra or missing changes are reported, which is good, but the response is not perfect.

Therefore, I deduct for each missing task name and the less precise formatting, and assign a 7.0.
