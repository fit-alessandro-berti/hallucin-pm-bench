9.5

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in all assessments (correctly identifies violation in Rule 3 only, satisfies others), fully references each rule as required by the prompt, and provides concise justifications matching the prompt's "short justification" request. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: bullet list vs. table format (-0.3); slightly varying phrasing (e.g., "before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`" vs. "before RA is completed" with explicit "both QE and RA"; "not compliant" vs. "non-compliant"; header "**No.**" vs. "**No – the trace is not compliant.**") (-0.2). No factual errors or omissions.
