**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correctness (full credit):** All answers are factually identical to ground truth (3 cases listed correctly; Pack_Items for Q2; Cancel_Order for Q3).
- **Conciseness/Format deductions (-1.8 total):**
  - Prompt demands "**concise, bullet-point answers only**"; LLM adds unnecessary "## Answers" header (-0.3), full trace explanation/timestamps for Q2 (-0.8), and explanatory table for Q3 (-0.7). Ground truth is purely minimal bullets with no extras.
  - Minor phrasing diffs (e.g., "Q1 – Distinct cases:" vs "A1:", backticks/codes vs plain, "→" arrows) are small errors but deduct per strictness (-0.2).
- No other errors; high score reflects accuracy despite format/verbosity violations.
