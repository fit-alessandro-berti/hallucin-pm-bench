6.0

R1: Correct evaluation and justification.

R2: Incorrect. The LLM says "Compliant," but ground truth is "Violated"—after the Change_Request, per R5, a new Manager_Approval is required, and for R2, the "last required approval" should be that new Manager_Approval (2025-03-07), but Ship_Goods was done on 2025-03-05, which is before the new approval. So, justification and verdict are wrong.

R3: Correct. Both the verdict ("Violated") and justification match.

R4: Correct. Both match as "Not Applicable" for hazardous = false.

R5: Partially correct. The LLM flags a violation and gives a somewhat accurate short justification. However, it only refers to "Ship_Goods after Change_Request without new Manager_Approval," neglecting that "Pay_Invoice" also occurred before the new approval, as specified in the ground truth.

R6: Correct.

Conclusion: Correct, NON-COMPLIANT.

Major error: Wrong status for R2 (should be "Violated," not "Compliant")—this is a crucial misjudgment.
Minor error: R5 justification is incomplete compared to the expected answer.

Following the utmost strictness (significant deduction for a major rule misclassification, some further deduction for incomplete justification), I assign a 6.0.
