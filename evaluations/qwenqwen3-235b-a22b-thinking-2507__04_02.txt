6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Fully matches status and justification (minor wording differences negligible). Full credit.
- **R2**: Major errorâ€”status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores post-change approval requirement, misidentifying "last required approval." Significant deduction.
- **R3**: Matches status and justification fully. Full credit.
- **R4**: Matches status and justification fully. Full credit.
- **R5**: Status matches, but justification incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice and other steps before new approval). Partial credit, notable loss for missing key examples.
- **R6**: Matches status and justification fully. Full credit.
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT), but lacks ground truth's violation summary (not required by prompt, so minor). 

Strict scoring: 4/6 rules fully accurate (66%), adjusted down for R5 incompleteness and R2 severity, yielding 6.0. Format adheres to prompt but lacks table structure (not penalized as unspecified).
