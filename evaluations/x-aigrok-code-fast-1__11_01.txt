### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) and accurately quotes the required average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim from the table. It stays under 150 words (128), avoids any discussion of service times, throughput, or unrelated activities, and frames the response as a memo.

However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:
- **Major differences in actions**: The recommendations are entirely invented and diverge significantly from the ground truth's specific, targeted suggestions (e.g., LLM's "digitizing via online portal" vs. ground truth's "automated customer reminders"; no overlap in proposed solutions). While both promise ≥20% reductions, the LLM's actions lack the ground truth's precise, process-specific focus (e.g., escalation triggers, e-signature replacement, rules-engine pre-classification).
- **Data-driven claims**: The LLM fabricates unsupported specifics like "35% in 200 cases (data from executions trend)", "22% in 170 executions", and "25% in 150 assessments", which loosely reference table executions but introduce unsubstantiated details. The ground truth uses more conservative phrasing (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%", "estimated 30%") without such inventions, violating the "without inventing unsupported data" scoring note.
- **Format and conciseness**: The LLM's full memo structure adds polite framing (e.g., "Dear COO", sign-off) and a vague closing sentence ("yield significant efficiency gains"), exceeding the ground truth's crisp, bullet-like minimalism while still meeting word limits. This introduces minor extraneous content.
- **Minor issues**: Small phrasing inconsistencies (e.g., "p95" in ground truth vs. "95th percentile" in LLM) and the invented data reflect sloppiness, warranting point deductions per strictness guidelines.

Overall, core facts align (60% match), but substantive divergences in actions and data claims reduce the score significantly.
