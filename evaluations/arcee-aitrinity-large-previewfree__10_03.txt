**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly uses **all four mandated terms** exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no synonyms or leaks (+1.5). Markdown table format followed. Covers roles from roster.
- **Major Errors (heavy deductions)**:
  - **Activities mismatch** (-3.0): Adds unauthorized rows ("Approval (if score >70)", "Payment Scheduling (if score ≤70)", "Fund Release", "Notify Analyst") violating "do not rename, merge, or add activities". Ground truth (GT) has exactly 6 precise activities; LLM has 8 with inexact names (e.g., no "Compliance Officer Approval" or "Release Funds"). Conditional phrasing "(if score >70)" is interpretive addition.
  - **RACI assignments inaccurate/incomplete** (-2.5): Sparse and wrong vs. GT. Examples:
    | Activity | Key GT vs. LLM diffs |
    |----------|----------------------|
    | Intake Vetting | GT: Front **R,A**, CompA C, Treas I. LLM: Front R only (misses A/C/I; -0.8). |
    | KYC Review | GT: CompA **R,A**, Officer C, Treas I. LLM: CompA R only (-0.7). |
    | AML Screening | Same as KYC (-0.7). |
    | Risk Scoring | GT: Front C, CompA R, Officer **A**, Treas I. LLM: CompA R + Officer A only (misses C/I; -0.3). |
  - **Formatting/precision** (-1.0): No bolding (** **) on activities/key RACI (GT standard). Uses blanks instead of "–" for no involvement. No "R, A" combos where GT specifies. Table alignment/headers minor mismatch.
- **Overall**: ~70% deviation in content/structure from GT; vocab compliance doesn't offset violations. Strict penalty for additions/errors yields low score.
