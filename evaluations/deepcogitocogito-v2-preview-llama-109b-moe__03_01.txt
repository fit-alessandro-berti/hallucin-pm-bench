2.0

### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth and prompt requirements in structure, content, and technical accuracy. Key issues include:

- **Non-compliant output format**: The response includes extensive explanatory text, analysis, and multiple redundant XML blocks (e.g., initial version, "cleaned up" versions, final version). The prompt mandates a *single* `<definitions> … </definitions>` block only, ≤40 lines, with no additional content. This alone warrants severe deduction, as it fails the core output instruction.

- **Invalid BPMN 2.0 XML structure**:
  - Incorrect primary namespace (`xmlns="http://www.omg.org/spec/DD/20110524/DC"` instead of the required BPMN MODEL namespace `http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/20100524/MODEL`). This mixes diagram (DC/DI) namespaces unnecessarily and breaks XML validity—tools would reject it as non-BPMN.
  - Extraneous `xmlns` attributes for diagram interchange (bpmndi, omgdi, omgdc), explicitly forbidden by the prompt ("No diagram/interchange elements are required").
  - Missing `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` declaration present in ground truth.
  - Wrong `targetNamespace` ("http://www.ti" vs. ground truth's "http://acmetech/support").
  - `isExecutable="true"` on process (ground truth: "false").
  - Process lacks `name="Support-Ticket"` (ground truth has it; LLM's is unnamed beyond ID).

- **Element mismatches and inventions**:
  - Uses `automaticTask` for classification and `userTask` for all others, inventing task types not mentioned in the description or required by the prompt. Ground truth correctly uses generic `task` for simplicity and adherence ("Do not invent... activities").
  - No `name` attributes on start (`"Ticket Submitted"`) and end (`"Ticket Closed"`) events.
  - Activity and gateway names differ substantially, adding interpretive flair not in the description:
    - "Ticket Classification" vs. ground truth "Auto-Classification".
    - "Is Password Reset?" vs. "Password Reset?".
    - "Resolution Path?" vs. "Resolved Internally?" (invents "Path" and "Internally"; description says "either 'Resolve Issue' or 'Forward to Specialist'").
    - "Customer Confirmation?" vs. "Customer Confirms?".
  - Three exclusive gateways (gw1, gw2, gw3), but prompt specifies "the two decision points" (likely classification and post-diagnosis). Ground truth also uses three for the loop, but LLM's extra/inaccurate naming compounds the issue.

- **Missing critical BPMN semantics**:
  - No `<conditionExpression>` on sequence flows from gateways (e.g., no "yes"/"no" for decisions like Password Reset?, Resolved Internally?, Customer Confirms?). Ground truth includes them explicitly for exclusive gateway logic, essential for BPMN 2.0 decision modeling. LLM's gateways lack any decision criteria, making them non-functional.
  - Sequence flow IDs use "out#" prefix (e.g., out1-out13) instead of concise "f#" as in ground truth and prompt example (e.g., "t1", "gw1").

- **Adherence to description**:
  - Core flow is mostly captured (start → classify → gw1 → reset/else → diagnosis → gw2 → resolve/forward → resolve → confirm → gw3 → close/loop), including loop to "Initial Diagnosis" and direct path from "Provide Reset Instructions" to confirm (implied as resolution).
  - However, small inventions like task types and names violate "exactly as stated" and "Do not invent... activities".
  - Line count: Final block is ~25 lines (compliant), but irrelevantly so given other failures.

- **Overall strictness**: Under utmost strictness, even minor name variances (e.g., "Auto-Classification" vs. "Ticket Classification") and absent conditions deduct heavily, as they alter precise modeling. The invalid XML and extraneous text make the output unusable as BPMN 2.0, far from the ground truth's clean, valid, minimal implementation. Structure similarity (~60% flow match) prevents a 1.0, but technical and format errors dominate.
