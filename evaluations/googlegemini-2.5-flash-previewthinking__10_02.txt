6.0

The LLM answer demonstrates an understanding of RACI tables, mandates enforced terms, and avoids prohibited synonyms. However, there are significant deviations from the ground truth that must be strictly penalized:

**Major Issues:**
- The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" role, which is present in the ground truth and acts as Accountable for every task. This is a critical oversight: failing to designate an "Accountable" role correctly for each activity is a core RACI error.
- Some activities do not use the precise mandated activity wordings from the ground truth and instead create new phrases or paraphrase tasks (e.g., "Instruction Logging" instead of "Receive Payment Instruction," "Sanctions Screening" instead of "Screen Against Sanctions List," etc.).
- The "KYC Review" activity is properly labeled, but the roles for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed do not match the ground truth.
- Several Informed (I) and Consulted (C) assignments deviate from the ground truth (e.g., Regulatory Liaison not Informed for "Payment Release").

**Other Notable Deviations:**
- LLM sometimes merges or splits tasks differently than the ground truth, e.g., "Instruction Logging" and "Receive Customer Instruction" are separated, while the ground truth has "Receive Payment Instruction." Lack of direct correspondence impacts clarity and consistency.
- IT Support is omitted as Responsible or Consulted on some relevant steps.

**Positive Aspects:**
- The vocabulary mandate is respected for all primary roles ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"). There are no forbidden synonyms.
- The table is presented cleanly in Markdown.

**Impact on Score:**  
Omitting a whole column (role) and deviating in role assignment and activity wording are major flaws, so a significant point reduction is mandatory. However, there is still some structural correctness, and the mandated synonyms are respected, justifying partial credit. Thus, 6.0 is the strict score.
