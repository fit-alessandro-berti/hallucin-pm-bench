8.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, identifying the exact three decision points with precise conditions/outcomes matching the process flow and using verbatim activity names (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision", "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)"). The document list is complete and correct, closely mirroring the prompt's terminology.

**Deductions for strict evaluation (total -1.5 points):**
- **Formatting/structure differences (-0.7):** Tables, subheaders (###), explicit count ("three decision points"), and step numbers (e.g., "(Step 5)") add elaboration not in ground truth's concise numbered list with "####" headers and inline descriptions.
- **Phrasing variances (-0.5):** "Proof of Address (no older than 3 months)" vs. ground truth "(≤ 3 months)"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; " (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (extra word matching prompt but diverging from ground truth).
- **Extra/expanded content (-0.3):** Explicit reject outcome ("Process ends; funds not disbursed"); added note differing from ground truth's ("No credit-bureau... at Quick KYC Verification" vs. "No credit bureau report, collateral forms...").

No factual errors, omissions, or introduction of forbidden terminology; highly similar overall but not identical.
