**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1, correctly identified). No errors.
- **Q2**: Strong alignment on small sample size (14 events/3 cases/<2h vs. full month), label variation (exact examples: “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”; string sensitivity), and non-representative nature. Under 120 words. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking GT's precise quantification (e.g., "0% to 7%" swing, "wide confidence interval," "extreme sampling error for rare events"); (2) tangential addition of intra-case repeats (valid generally but less relevant to single-occurrence "Manual Fraud Check," dilutes focus); (3) no reiteration of exact occurrence/location or call for "randomly drawn slice/full log." Still highly accurate overall.
