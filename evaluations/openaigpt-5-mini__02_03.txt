The LLM answer matches the ground truth in content, accuracy, and structure (concise bullet points), with negligible formatting variations (e.g., "distinct" wording adds precision without error; backslash in ground truth is likely markdown escape, not substantive difference). No errors or deviations detected under strict evaluation.
