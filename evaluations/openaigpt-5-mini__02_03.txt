9.7

- The LLM answer is correct on all substance: all three bullet points (number of cases, immediate predecessor of "Ship_Order" in C456, and the "exactly once" activity) are correct.
- The only minor difference is formatting: the use of explicit parenthetical case list in the first bullet (present in LLM, not in ground truth) and lack of marking (A1, A2, A3) as in the ground truth answer.
- Because you directed to be strict and said even small errors should result in significant loss, a deduction is justified for the somewhat less structured/explicit format.
- However, the actual information is fully correct and concise.

Hence, 9.7.
