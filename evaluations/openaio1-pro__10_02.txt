2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a very low score under the utmost strictness guideline. Even minor phrasing differences and incomplete coverage result in substantial deductions. Key issues:

- **Structural Mismatches (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**:
  - Missing "Operations Manager" column, which is present in the ground truth. The prompt mandates using *only* specified terms but does not prohibit inferring hierarchical roles like this from process logic; the ground truth includes it to properly distribute "Accountable" (A) responsibilities, which the LLM incorrectly overloads onto performers (e.g., Transaction Analyst as both R and A).
  - No "Legend" row explaining R/A/C/I, which the ground truth explicitly includes for clarity and completeness.
  - Table header lacks the ground truth's "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" phrasing, reducing precision.

- **Task Coverage and Phrasing Errors (Major Deduction: -2.5 points)**:
  - Tasks are not fully aligned or split correctly. For example:
    - LLM combines step 5 ("Release payment; ensure SWIFT message is sent") into one row, omitting the distinct SWIFT handling implied in ground truth's "Release Payment" (with IT Support as C, not R).
    - LLM's task 6 ("Archive case file; notify Regulatory Liaison") adds "notify" explicitly in the task description, which ground truth handles via I in cells, not task text. Ground truth simplifies to "Archive Record" without extras.
    - Phrasing deviations: "Receive transfer instruction and log in system" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Approve high-risk transaction" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions" (plural mismatch); "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" adds unnecessary details not in ground truth's "**KYC Review**".
  - Ground truth uses bolding (e.g., "**KYC Review**") and mandated wording precisely; LLM uses it but inconsistently (e.g., no bolding for KYC in cells).
  - All tasks from the source text are covered, but LLM introduces substitutions/expansions not in ground truth, violating strict mapping.

- **RACI Assignments Inaccuracies (Major Deduction: -1.5 points)**:
  - Widespread errors in role assignments, often flipping or omitting ground truth logic (e.g., separating R from A to different roles like Regulatory Liaison R + Operations Manager A).
    - Task 1: LLM (Transaction Analyst R/A) ignores Regulatory Liaison I, Operations Manager A, IT Support C.
    - Task 2: LLM (Transaction Analyst R/A) ignores Regulatory Liaison A, Operations Manager I, IT Support C.
    - Task 3: Partial match (Regulatory Liaison R/A close to R; Transaction Analyst C matches), but misses Operations Manager A and IT Support I; LLM uses "C" for Transaction Analyst without ground truth's bolding.
    - Task 4: LLM (Regulatory Liaison R/A; Transaction Analyst I) mismatches Transaction Analyst C, Operations Manager A, IT Support I.
    - Task 5: LLM (Transaction Analyst R/A; IT Support R) mismatches Regulatory Liaison I, Operations Manager A, IT Support C; incorrect R for IT on SWIFT.
    - Task 6: LLM (IT Support R/A; Regulatory Liaison I) misses Transaction Analyst C and Operations Manager A.
  - Uses dashes ("â€“") for blanks, unlike ground truth's explicit letters; this reduces readability and precision.

- **Vocabulary and Mandate Compliance (Minor but Deducted: -0.5 points; partial credit as baseline)**:
  - Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst", and includes "IT Support" from the source without unmandated substitutions.
  - No violations like "Customer Due Diligence" or "Compliance Officer", but failure to fully emulate ground truth's mandated structure (e.g., bolding) counts as a small error.

Overall, the LLM answer covers the basics but fails to replicate the ground truth's precise role distribution, task granularity, and formatting, resulting in an incomplete and inaccurate RACI table. A perfect match would score 10.0; this is ~20% aligned at best, hence 2.0.
