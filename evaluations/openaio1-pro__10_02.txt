5.0

Analysis:

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer consistently uses the mandated role terminology (“KYC Review,” “Regulatory Liaison,” “Transaction Analyst”).
- Generally applies RACI model per step, and arranges the markdown table reasonably clearly.

**Major Errors and Point Deductions:**
1. **Missing Role:**
   - “Operations Manager” is present in the ground truth, and conspicuously absent in the LLM answer. The ground truth makes this the **Accountable** (A) party for every task. This omission is critical and by itself warrants a significant penalty.

2. **RACI Role Assignment Errors:**
   - **Accountability is often misassigned:**
     - For example, in the first two tasks, the Transaction Analyst is listed as both Responsible and Accountable. In the ground truth, Transaction Analyst is Responsible and Operations Manager is Accountable.
   - **Consulted/Informed roles are often missing or incorrect:**
     - For “Screen payment against sanctions list,” Regulatory Liaison is missing accountability (“A”); in ground truth, this is a critical distinction.
     - For “Perform KYC Review,” Regulatory Liaison is not shown as Accountable; Operations Manager is missing.
     - For “Archive case file,” Regulatory Liaison is only Informed in ground truth, but not Consulted or otherwise involved as in LLM answer.
   - There’s an “I” under Transaction Analyst for high-risk approval, which does not appear in the ground truth.

3. **Activity Naming:**
   - The ground truth standardizes activities (“Receive Payment Instruction,” “KYC Review,” etc.) in a more abstracted, mandated way, while the LLM answer sometimes paraphrases (“Receive transfer instruction and log in system” vs. “Receive Payment Instruction”).

4. **Column and Table Structure:**
   - The LLM answer omits a legend explaining RACI codes.
   - Columns do not match the ground truth exactly; “Operations Manager” is entirely missing, role alignment is incomplete.

5. **Order and Organization:**
   - The source steps aren’t always mapped to the process activity names as tightly as the ground truth—e.g., “archive case file; notify regulatory liaison” merges two activities that are split in the ground truth (“Archive Record”).

**Summary:**
Because of the missing “Operations Manager,” repeated misassignment of RACI roles, activity verb inconsistencies, and a lack of exact mapping and legend, this answer loses at least 5 points. The answer is clear and makes a reasonable attempt at procedural mapping, but does not meet the strict requirements of full RACI/Roles/Terms accuracy.

**Final score:** 5.0
