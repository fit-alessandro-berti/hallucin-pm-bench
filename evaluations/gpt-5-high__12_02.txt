The LLM answer correctly identifies the key counterexamples (C003 and C005) with precise line citations, directly refuting the "always follows" claim in a single paragraph as required. It matches the ground truth's core reasoning and structure (starting with "No" followed by justification), but slightly over-explains by mentioning positive cases (C001, C002, C004), which are accurate yet extraneous to the minimal gold-standard focus on violations only. No factual errors or omissions of critical evidence, justifying a near-perfect score under strict evaluation.
