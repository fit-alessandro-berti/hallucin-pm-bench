**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision Points (major discrepancies, ~60% of score weight)**: LLM identifies only 1 decision point (high-value threshold), with accurate branching but no location specified (GT places it "after Finance_Controller_PreApprove"). Ground truth lists **3 distinct points** with precise locations, branching logic, and outcomes (eligibility in triage; threshold; final approval/rejection in pre-approve/senior review). LLM explicitly downplays others as "not explicit," missing implied decisions from activity descriptions (triage validation, approval steps) and constraints (success required for payment). This is a **critical omission** of 2/3 points → severe deduction (-4.0 base).
- **Required Documents (strong match, ~30% weight)**: Lists all 7 exactly (same order possible, usage notes align, e.g., AuditTrail for high-value). Minor phrasing diff ("The following documents and artefacts" vs. "Complete list"), but no extras introduced → full credit here (+2.0 offset).
- **Format/Completeness/Compliance (~10% weight)**: Clean structure, no unauthorized additions (good), but lacks GT's table/numbered format, full logic details, and rejection paths. Defensive phrasing ("single explicit") contradicts "every decision point" prompt → minor deduction (-0.5). Overall non-standard flow respected.
- **Strict Adjustments**: Per instructions, small errors (e.g., incomplete branching, no rejection outcomes) amplify loss; incompleteness on core task (decisions) dominates. Not 10.0 (perfect match) or even 7.0 (minor gaps); lands at 4.0 for half-accuracy despite documents.
