The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly except for Q5, where it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as never appearing as the first event of a case. In reality, "Quality_Check" does start case C-77, so it should not appear in Q5. This is a significant factual error for Q5, but all other answers are correct, so a loss of 2 points is appropriate.
