The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. For Q5, it correctly identifies three of the four activities that never appear as the first event ("Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") but incorrectly includes "Quality_Check", which does appear as the first (and only) event for case C-77. This is a single factual error in the list, violating the instruction to use only facts directly from the log (requiring timestamp-based ordering per case to determine first events). Under strict evaluation, this deduction reflects the incomplete accuracy of Q5, treating it as approximately 75% correct due to the extraneous item.
