### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 (no differences in values or format). However, Q5 contains a significant factual error: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an extra incorrect item in the list. This violates the strict instruction to use only facts directly from the log and leads to a non-matching array (4 items vs. 3 in ground truth, with one wrong entry). Under utmost strictness, this error in one key response component warrants a notable deduction, but the majority accuracy preserves a solid score. The JSON schema and overall structure are adhered to correctly.
