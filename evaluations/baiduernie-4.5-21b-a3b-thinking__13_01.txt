The LLM answer is an exact match for questions 1-3, with precise counting, calculation (including the formula), and case identification directly from the log lines, without inference or hallucination. For question 4, both reasons provided are valid sampling-related concerns (temporal bias from the single-day limitation and small sample/case-mix bias from the limited number of cases), clearly stated and derivable from the fragment's scope, aligning with the ground truth's allowable responses. No deviations, errors, or unjustified assumptions are present.
