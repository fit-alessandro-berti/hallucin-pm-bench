### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and fidelity to RACI principles, warranting a very low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Columns/Roles**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely (present in all rows of the ground truth), resulting in incomplete stakeholder coverage. It only uses Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support, introducing gaps where accountability (A) is often missing or misassigned. This is a fundamental structural error, as RACI tables require comprehensive roles to cover responsibility chains.

- **Task Granularity and Wording**: 
  - The LLM combines "receive" and "log" into a single "Log transfer instruction in system" row, while the ground truth separates them as "Receive Payment Instruction." This omits explicit coverage of the "receive" step from the source.
  - Minor but penalized wording variances: e.g., LLM's "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. ground truth's "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" adds unmandated specifics ("on sender and beneficiary," not in ground truth or source as a required detail); "Release payment to SWIFT network" includes extraneous "to SWIFT network"; "Archive case documentation" vs. "Archive Record." The mandated "**KYC Review**" is bolded and concise in ground truth but verbose in LLM.
  - No explicit handling of the source's "notification" to the Regulatory Liaison in step 6; neither table adds a row, but this contributes to incomplete mapping.

- **RACI Assignments**: Mismatches across nearly every row, even where roles overlap, violating strict similarity requirements:
  - Log/Receive: LLM (TA: R, RL: I, no A) vs. ground truth (TA: R, RL: I, OM: A, IT: C) – lacks A and IT involvement.
  - Screen: LLM (TA: R, RL: C, no A) vs. ground truth (TA: R, RL: A, OM: I, IT: C) – RL role (C vs. A), missing OM/IT, no A.
  - KYC Review: LLM (TA: C, RL: R, no A/IT involvement shown as "-") vs. ground truth (TA: C, RL: R, OM: A, IT: I) – missing A (OM) and IT (I vs. -).
  - Approve: Similar partial overlap (TA: C, RL: R), but missing OM: A and IT: I; LLM lacks A.
  - Release: LLM (TA: R, RL: I, IT: A) vs. ground truth (TA: R, RL: I, OM: A, IT: C) – IT role (A vs. C), missing OM as A.
  - Archive: LLM (TA: I, RL: I, IT: R, no A) vs. ground truth (TA: C, RL: I, OM: A, IT: R) – TA role (I vs. C), missing OM as A; adds unneeded TA involvement.

- **RACI Integrity**: The LLM frequently omits an "Accountable" (A) designation (e.g., for Log, Screen, KYC, Approve, Archive), which is a core RACI flaw—not every task has an ultimate accountable party, unlike the ground truth's consistent OM: A. Use of "-" for no involvement is extra and not in ground truth.

- **Additional Elements**: 
  - Legend: LLM's is more verbose and includes "-" explanation; ground truth is concise.
  - Notes: LLM's notes justify deviations (e.g., "split activities," "maintained IT Support") and add interpretive commentary not in ground truth, which strictly notes vocabulary adherence and mapping without extras.
  - Markdown Formatting: Both use tables, but ground truth uses bolding for mandated terms (e.g., **KYC Review**) and **R/A/C/I** in cells; LLM does not, reducing visual alignment.
  - Vocabulary Adherence: Both correctly use mandated terms (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst), but LLM's extras (e.g., SWIFT, case file) introduce unsubstantiated details, penalized as deviations from source/ground truth conciseness.

These errors—structural omissions, mismatched assignments, incomplete accountability, and wording variances—accumulate to show low fidelity. Even if the LLM reasonably interprets the source, it must align with the ground truth for scoring, and small discrepancies (e.g., task phrasing, IT involvements) compound to justify severe point loss. A perfect match would require identical tables; here, it's a partial reinterpretation.
