6.0

**Justification:**

**Major Errors:**

1. **Omission of "Operations Manager":**
   - The ground truth includes an "Operations Manager" as the Accountable ("A") in every row. The LLM answer omits this role entirely, which is a significant process deficiency. Accountabilities are thereby either excluded or misassigned.

2. **Accountable Role Assignments:**
   - In several rows, the LLM answer fails to assign the "A" (Accountable) role correctly—e.g., "Release payment to SWIFT network" lists IT Support as Accountable instead of an oversight/managerial role, which is inconsistent with the source, and no "A" is given for several rows in others.

3. **Unclear Task Breakdown and Naming:**
   - Some tasks in the LLM answer ("Log transfer instruction in system", "Release payment to SWIFT network") deviate in naming from the stricter ground truth. The ground truth uses simpler, stricter task names matching the process steps directly from the source, e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "Release Payment".
   - The activity “KYC Review” is handled acceptably in terms of vocabulary, but using "log transfer instruction in system" and "screen payment" is an unnecessary restatement versus the process-matching phrasing in the ground truth.

**Minor Errors:**

4. **C/I Assignments:**
   - For multiple tasks, the LLM answer's C/I assignments do not always correspond to the ground truth's detailed consultation and information flows. For example, “Archive case documentation” consults/informs different parties than in the ground truth.
   - The Regulatory Liaison is sometimes "Consulted" vs. "Accountable" or "Responsible," differing from the ground truth’s granular mapping.

5. **Formatting:**
   - The LLM answer’s legend is clear, and although the table is in Markdown, it does not highlight the mandated words in bold as per the ground truth, though this is a relatively minor point.

**WHAT IT GOT RIGHT:**
- All three mandated roles are used correctly with no forbidden synonyms.
- "KYC Review" is used as required.
- IT Support is correctly left as "IT Support". 
- Tasks are split in a process-logical manner.
- Activities correspond to the original process.

**Deduction rationale:**  
- **−2 points** for omitting the "Operations Manager".
- **−1 point** for repeated misassignment/missing Accountable roles.
- **−0.5 point** for small deviations in activity naming.
- **−0.5 point** for minor deviations in C/I duties.

Thus resulting in a **strict, documentation-level score of 6.0**.
