**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and fails on multiple critical dimensions compared to the ground truth:

- **Wrong verdict**: Claims "Compliant" instead of "Non-compliant".
- **Incorrect rule analysis**:
  - Rule 2: Falsely states "Risk_Assessment precedes Ship_Goods" (trace shows Ship_Goods at #8 before Risk_Assessment at #9).
  - Rule 3: Ignores the violation (Three_way_match at #10 exceeds distance ≤2 from Goods_Received at #6).
- **Incomplete/missing checks**: No evaluation of all rules (e.g., skips explicit checks for rules 3-5); vague phrasing like "follows constraints without IC role conflicts" (typo/irrelevant) instead of numbered justifications citing rules/events.
- **Format violation**: Lacks numbered justification structure; overly brief and non-specific.

Zero credit for accuracy, completeness, or adherence to required format—maximum differences warrant minimum score.
