9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names and comma-separated formatting, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it includes an unnecessary introductory sentence ("Okay, focusing solely on Process B..."), which deviates from the prompt's instruction to return the answer strictly as numbered lines without additional text. This minor formatting violation warrants a deduction of 1.0 point under strict evaluation criteria.
