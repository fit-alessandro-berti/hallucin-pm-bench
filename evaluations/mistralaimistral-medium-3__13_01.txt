9.0

1. The LLM answer correctly states: "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time. (**Matches ground truth.**)
2. It calculates 1 out of 18 = 5.56%, with correct rounding. (**Matches ground truth.**)
3. Correctly identifies case A1002 as the one containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”. (**Matches ground truth.**)
4. Provides two correct reasons for unreliability:
   - Small sample size.
   - Temporal bias (fragment covers only a single day).
   
**Minor deductions:**
- The LLM says: "The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01)..." This is slightly off; the log covers a window from 09:00 to 14:05 on that day—not the full day. Precision is important; strictly, it's not the entire day.  
- The LLM omits other possible sampling biases listed in the ground truth (case-mix and survivorship/truncation bias). While it only needed two, including a mention or qualifying that these are not the only issues would have demonstrated stronger process-analytic rigor.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is correct, well-structured, and does not introduce information not derivable from the logs. However, very minor imprecision in the description of the time interval and not referencing all possible biases results in a strict deduction.

**Final score: 9.0**
