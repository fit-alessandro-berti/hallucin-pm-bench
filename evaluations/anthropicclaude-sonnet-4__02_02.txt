10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, sequence, and ordering for all three questions. Minor formatting differences (e.g., no bullets in Q3, explanatory text) do not introduce errors or hallucinations, so no point deduction is warranted under strict evaluation criteria focused on precision against the ground truth answers.
