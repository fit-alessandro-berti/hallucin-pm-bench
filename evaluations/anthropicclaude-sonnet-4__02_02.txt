- Q1: Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003).
- Q2: Provides the exact correct sequence for C002: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order.
- Q3: Correctly finds and alphabetically lists “Arrange_Delivery” and “Check_Stock” as the only immediate predecessors of “Ship_Order”.
