**4.0**

The LLM answer correctly recognizes that computation is impossible and lists the required metrics (average cycle time, std dev, 95% CI), but it fails strict alignment with the ground truth and prompt in multiple ways, warranting major deductions: (1) Vague phrasing ("lacks sufficient detail", "additional information") instead of precise identification of Artefact A's redaction of all rows/timestamps (start_time/complete_time); (2) No explicit tie to "Approve Invoice" executions or need for raw log entries; (3) Uses "cycle times" (plural) vs. singular activity; (4) Shorter and less explanatory, not matching the "one short paragraph" precision on data absence; (5) Misses direct "Impossible" tone and full coverage of why dispersion/CI can't be calculated. These omissions make it substantially less accurate and complete.
