3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit: +2.0)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). This adheres to the strict policy, but the introductory text ("Okay, I will create...") is extraneous and not in the ground truth, slightly diluting purity.
  
- **Completeness of Activities (-4.0 Penalty)**: The ground truth includes six activities, explicitly deriving from the full narrative (e.g., escalation/approval and fund release are distinct steps). The LLM only covers four, omitting "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". This violates "covering every activity... described above" and "do not... add activities" (by under-covering). Strictness demands full extraction—no partial credit for guessing only the mandated terms.

- **RACI Assignments Accuracy (-3.0 Penalty)**: Assignments are incomplete and mismatched across all rows:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Missing C (Compliance Analyst), I (Treasury Ops), and A's dual role for Front-Office Analyst (only R shown).
  - **KYC Review & AML Screening**: Compliance Analyst should be R,A (not just R); Compliance Officer is C (not A); missing I (Treasury Ops).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Missing C (Front-Office Analyst) and I (Treasury Ops).
  - Uses blank cells instead of dashes (–) for no involvement, per ground truth convention.
  This results in widespread inaccuracies, even for covered activities.

- **Formatting & Structure (-1.0 Penalty)**: Markdown table is present but lacks bolding for activities/roles (as in ground truth), uses inconsistent spacing, and includes unrequested introductory text. No explanatory notes like the ground truth's key points.

Overall, the answer shows basic awareness of core policy but fails fundamentally on completeness and precision, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Even minor mismatches (e.g., blanks vs. dashes) compound the deductions.
