2.0

The LLM answer demonstrates several serious issues compared to the ground truth, and, per the instruction to apply strictness even for small errors, a very low score is warranted. Detailed assessment:

**Critical issues:**
- **Missing Activities:** The LLM omits key process activities. Specifically, "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" are not included. It also lacks notification of the originating analyst, implied in the release step.
- **RACI Errors:** The RACI assignments are both incomplete and nearly all incorrect:
    - No use of "A" (Accountable) for most activities, violating RACI best practice and contradicting process governance conventions.
    - Where “R” or “A” are assigned, these do not match the detailed ground truth, for example:
        - "Intake Vetting" lacks “A” for Front-Office Analyst (should be R, A).
        - "KYC Review" and "AML Screening" incorrectly mark Compliance Officer as "A" (should be only "C"), and omit Inform and Consulted roles.
    - Fails to mark “C” or “I” where ground truth demands it, e.g. Treasury Ops should be “I” in several rows.
- **Matrix Structure:** The matrix omits most activities, and compresses roles' responsibilities, resulting in a superficial mapping that does not hold process or compliance rigor.
- **Vocabulary Use:** Full points for correct usage of mandated vocabulary: "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", and "Risk Scoring"—none of the forbidden synonyms appear. However, these four activities alone are insufficient coverage.
- **Formatting:** The basic Markdown table structure is present, but the RACI entries are sparse or erroneous as detailed above.

**Conclusion:**  
Because of major omissions (nearly half the activities are missing), grossly incorrect RACI attributions, and failure to cover all roles in each activity as requested, this answer scores 2.0 (only points for adhering to vocabulary policy and table format).
