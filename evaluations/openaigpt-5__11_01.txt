7.0

**Detailed evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies the three worst activities (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability), ranks them in order, and provides the average and 95th-percentile waiting times **verbatim** from the table.
- Memo is concise and focused solely on waiting-time, with no reference to service-time, throughput, or any unmentioned activities.
- Each recommendation is *plausibly* relevant to waiting-time reduction, and all claim ≥ 20% reduction.

**Major deductions:**
1. **Deviation from ground-truth action recommendations:**
   - **Request_Documents:** LLM suggests “auto-escalate at 96 h” and “multi-step reminders”; ground-truth asks only for customer reminders with 24 h escalation; the LLM embellishes with multi-step and auto-escalation specifics, adding ungrounded actions and a quantitative target not in the source.
   - **Send_Closure_Letter:** LLM proposes “event-driven auto-generation and e-delivery within 1 h”—this promises an unrealistic “≥90% average reduction,” which is unsupported and not grounded in the original 30% from ground truth. Further, event-driven digital delivery is slightly more ambitious than the “same-day e-signature” replacement in ground truth.
   - **Assess_Liability:** LLM suggests “pull-based auto-assignment with WIP cap/Earliest Due Date (EDD) priority; SLA first-touch ≤4 h”—more of an operations management intervention than the “rules-engine pre-classification” (triaging cases so that simple ones skip the adjuster queue) specified in the ground truth.

2. **Memo format and content issues:**
   - Some wording is less executive-oriented (e.g., inserts jargon like “WIP cap,” “EDD priority,” “first-touch SLA ≤4 h”) than the ground truth, which is clearer.
   - In two of three cases, the actions use hypothetical/prescriptive language not included in ground truth, or suggest performance targets not supported by evidence (“Expected ≥90% avg reduction...” etc.).
   - Some actions include layered/compound interventions (e.g., multiple escalation thresholds) beyond what’s justified.
   - Verbatim quoting of numbers is present (good), but the output uses a less crisp, more technical tone.

**Summary:**  
The LLM memo remains substantively correct regarding activities, rankings, and core metrics, but departs via embellished, speculative, or unnecessarily complex remedies for each activity, with one case of a clearly unsupported claim (≥90% reduction). The structure is succinct, and irrelevant details are omitted, but lack of strict adherence to both prescribed empirical actions and simple presentation warrants a 3-point deduction. Even minor deviations, per the instructions, must be penalized.

**Score: 7.0**
