6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes (added tasks, removed tasks, and the gateway type change) matching the ground truth in substance, with no factual errors or omissions. However, under utmost strictness:
- **Added tasks**: Lists the exact three tasks but adds interpretive descriptions (e.g., "Precedes the 'Review Application' task"; "Replaces..."; "Separates..."), which deviate from the ground truth's concise, non-explanatory bullet-point style. This introduces unnecessary analysis, warranting a -1.0 deduction.
- **Removed tasks**: Correctly lists the single task but includes an explanatory phrase ("Removed as rejection logic is split..."), exceeding the strict summary format (-0.5 deduction).
- **Gateway-type changes**: Accurately describes the change but adds extra elaboration ("binary choice" to "can route to multiple paths, e.g., ..."), unlike the ground truth's precise, minimal wording (-0.5 deduction).
- **Overall structure/extras**: Uses bullet points instead of numbered lists (minor format mismatch, -0.5); includes an unauthorized "Note" section with further interpretation and ignored elements summary, violating "strictly under the three requested headings" (-1.0 deduction).

Total deductions: -3.5 from a perfect 10.0, resulting in 6.5. The answer is functionally useful but not strictly adherent to the prompt's concise requirements.
