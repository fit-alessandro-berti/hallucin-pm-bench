9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, with only two small errors:

1. In "Added tasks," the LLM answer gives brief process context text ("Precedes...", "Replaces...", "Separates...") after task names. While accurate, this is extra detail not in the ground truth structure, which asks only for the task name and ID.
2. The answer gives more interpretation about process logic ("replaces the original 'Reject Loan'...", etc.), which, while informative, was not requested and arguably extends beyond strict instructions to only summarize under the precise three headings.

Otherwise, every addition/removal/gateway change is correctly and succinctly identified, and it follows the requested headings exactly without missing or misclassifying any change.

For strict grading, these two minor departures warrant a non-negligible penalty: **9.0**.
