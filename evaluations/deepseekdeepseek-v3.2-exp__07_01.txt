7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway), aligning with the prompt's requirements to list only differences from the XML under the specified headings, without speculation. However, it loses points for deviations from the ground truth in presentation and detail:

- **Added and Removed tasks**: Uses only task IDs (e.g., "check_vip") instead of full names with IDs (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"), which omits key XML attributes (name) and reduces precision (-1.0 each, total -2.0).
- **Gateway type changes**: Concise phrasing lacks explicit version references ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)") and formatting emphasis on types (-0.5).
- Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., dashes vs. bullets, no backticks on IDs) slightly diverge from ground truth style (-0.5 total).

No extraneous content or errors in detection, but strict adherence to ground truth detail would yield a higher score.
