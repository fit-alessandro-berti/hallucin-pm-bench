The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the ground truth exactly in values and calculations. For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (68 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue ("only one case"), notes variance/instability ("distort... atypical values... skewed by these outliers"), and cautions against over-generalization ("unreliable generalizations... misinterpret this sparse occurrence"), fulfilling all required elements without invention or deviation from the log.
