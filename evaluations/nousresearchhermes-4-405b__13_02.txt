**9.6**

1. The LLM answer gets all numerical computations exactly correct:
   - (1) Occurs once.
   - (2a) 2.08% of events.
   - (2b) 8.33% of cases.

2. The explanation in (3) satisfies all three requirements:
   - Points out the single-occurrence issue.
   - Explicitly notes potential for distorted/skewed metrics, unstable results, unreliable generalizations.
   - Cautions against drawing general conclusions from such low support.

The only (very minor) shortcoming is the phrase "statistical models can be skewed by these outliers," which could be read as a slight generalization, since no explicit modeling is performed here and the excerpt is small. Ideally, the answer would be very explicit that all severe caveats stem only from this data's low support. Nonetheless, this is a negligible imprecision in phrasing.

Hence, the score is **9.6**.
