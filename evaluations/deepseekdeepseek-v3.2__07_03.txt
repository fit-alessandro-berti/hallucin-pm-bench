**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with perfect accuracy: the three added tasks, the one removed task, and the two gateway type changes match the ground truth exactly in content, IDs, names, and change descriptions. No extra or missing differences, no commentary, and stays strictly to verifiable XML diffs.

Minor formatting discrepancies deduct 1.0 point under utmost strictness:
- Headings include leading "-" (matching prompt display but differing from ground truth plain headings).
- Items lack leading "-" bullets (ground truth uses them consistently).
- Extra blank lines after each heading.
- Second gateway line lacks alignment spaces after ":" (ground truth aligns "exclusive").

These are small presentation errors but cause line-level text differences, warranting a significant but not drastic deduction given flawless semantics and completeness.
