2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer fails to fulfill the core requirement of returning *only* the memo text, instead delivering an excessively long (thousands of words), unstructured internal monologue of table analysis, repeated drafts, and reasoning that buries potential memo content. This violates the prompt's explicit instruction to "Return **only** the memo text," rendering the response unusable as an executive memo. Strict deduction for this structural error alone.

**Alignment with Prompt and Ground Truth (Strict Assessment):**
- **Identification of Three Worst Activities (Jointly on SLA Breaches and High Waiting Time):** Correctly selects Legal Approval (+300s excess, 600s wait), Risk Review (+300s excess, 480s wait), and Credit Assessment (+60s excess, 200s wait), matching ground truth and data (breaches: throughput > SLA; high waits relative to others like Verify Identity's lower 80s wait). No invention of absent activities. (+2 points potential, awarded partially.)
- **Quantification of SLA Excess:** Accurately calculates and references excesses (300s, 300s, 60s) in drafts, grounded in Avg_Throughput_Time - Target_SLA. Matches ground truth exactly. (+1 point.)
- **Word Count (≈150):** Drafts are ~100-150 words but fragmented and not final; no cohesive memo reaches this cleanly. (-0.5 penalty.)
- **Bullet Points Only for Recommendations:** Some drafts misuse bullets for activity descriptions (e.g., listing excesses with bullets), violating "bullet points *only* for the recommendations." Recommendations appear in bullets in later drafts but are narrative-embedded. Ground truth uses bold for activities and bullets strictly for actions. Significant deduction (-1.5).
- **Data Grounding/No Invention:** Mostly grounds in table (e.g., times, cases implied via context), but invents ungrounded action details like "triage mechanism for less complex cases," "real-time risk analytics," "automated data ingestion platform" without data support (e.g., no mention of case complexity, risk scores, or ingestion in table). Ground truth similarly invents specifics (e.g., "€25k loans," "35% reduction," "one risk analyst"), but LLM's are less concrete/data-tied. Prompt forbids this ("do NOT invent... metrics"); both err, but LLM's rambling amplifies non-grounding. (-2 points.)
- **Memo Format and Style:** No proper executive memo structure (e.g., ground truth's To/From/Subject, professional tone, projection summary). Drafts are informal ("We are Phi," endless "I must" hedging), lack COO addressing, and include extraneous analysis (e.g., debating Verify Identity inclusion). Not ≈150-word cohesive narrative. (-3 points.)
- **Recommendations (One Concrete, Data-Driven Action Each):** Provides three actions in drafts, somewhat tied to metrics (e.g., reduce 300s excess via triage), but vague/not data-driven (no specifics like ground truth's "low-risk files bypass" or "add one analyst," despite inventions). Actions are plausible but not "data-driven" per prompt (e.g., no case volumes like 465 for Legal Approval used to justify staffing). (-1 point.)

**Overall Strictness:** Small errors (e.g., bullet misuse, vague actions) compound with major failures (no clean output, inventions), far diverging from ground truth's polished, formatted memo. Minimal credit for correct identification/quantification; total score reflects ~25% alignment.
