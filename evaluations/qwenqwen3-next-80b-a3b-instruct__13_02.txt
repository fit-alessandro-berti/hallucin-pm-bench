9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). No deductions.
- **Question 2a/b**: Perfect match (calculations and rounding precise: 2.08% and 8.33%). No deductions.
- **Question 3**: Strong overall (â‰¤100 words; mentions single occurrence explicitly; cautions against over-generalization in performance/predictive contexts like process flow and model training). However, deducting 0.8 points for not explicitly noting variance/instability (e.g., no reference to noise skewing statistics, wide confidence intervals, or unreliable estimates like means/probabilities, as in ground truth criteria). This is a small but notable gap in depth for strict evaluation, implying rather than stating analytical pitfalls.
