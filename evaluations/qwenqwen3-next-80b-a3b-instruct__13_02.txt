**Score: 9.0**

**Evaluation:**

1. The answer to (1) is **correct** ("1 time"; matches ground truth).
2. The calculations in (2a) and (2b) are correct, with both the working and the final values (**2.08%** and **8.33%**), matching ground truth.
3. The explanation in (3) is accurate, concise, and stays within the 100-word limit. It notes the activity appears only once ("present in only one case"), warns that statistics based on it could be misleading in broader analyses (covers generalization), and mentions “model training” and process flow. However, it does not directly use terms like “variance/instability,” “single observation,” or “skew averages/confidence intervals” as in the requirements. While the message is there in spirit, explicit mention of instability/variance is slightly underemphasized.

**Summary:**  
All calculations are exact; the explanation is truthful but could explicitly state concepts like variance, instability, or statistical unreliability. For omitting explicit mention of instability/variance, **-1 point**. Otherwise, it is correct and does not invent any information.

**Strict Score:** **9.0**
