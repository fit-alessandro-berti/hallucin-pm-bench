The LLM answer correctly employs all required terminology—"KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance"—without using forbidden terms, which is an important aspect of the instructions and thus avoids the most severe penalties.

However, there are several strict issues when compared with the ground truth:

1. **RACI Role Completeness and Accuracy**:
   - The LLM answer only assigns one role per activity (typically "Responsible") and leaves all others blank, whereas the ground truth carefully distributes R, A (Accountable), C (Consulted), and I (Informed) among all roles for every activity. The RACI matrix should always be fully populated for all roles on all activities.
   - The ground truth uses "R / A" for Account Manager for several activities, and assigns C and I to other roles as appropriate. The LLM answer omits these critical distinctions; for example, "Order Vetting" and "Receive Application" do not show Account Manager as Accountable, nor do they show others as Consulted or Informed at any step.

2. **Capitalisation and Wording**:
   - The headings in the activity column (e.g., "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are correctly capitalised.

3. **Formatting**:
   - The headings match, but the LLM omits RACI codes (R, A, C, I), instead writing out "Responsible", and does not distinguish between Responsible and Accountable, which is key for a RACI chart.

4. **Lack of Detail**:
   - There are no "A" (Accountable), "C" (Consulted), or "I" (Informed) entries in the LLM's answer, only "Responsible".

5. **No Unwarranted Content**:
   - The LLM does not introduce extra steps or unrequested information.

**Summary**: 
The answer avoids the maximum penalty because forbidden terms are not used, and the process steps and role names are correct. However, the failure to fully assign RACI responsibilities, omission of Accountable/Consulted/Informed, and nonstandard RACI format (using words instead of R/A/C/I) are substantial shortcomings, leading to a strict deduction in score.

**Final Score: 6.0**
