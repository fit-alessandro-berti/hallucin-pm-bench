The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without forbidden terms and positions the single "Responsible" assignment per activity in alignment with the process narrative's primary performers. However, it fails significantly in multiple areas when strictly compared to the ground truth: (1) Uses full words ("Responsible") instead of standard RACI abbreviations (R, A, C, I), introducing non-standard formatting; (2) Provides an incomplete matrix with blanks for all non-Responsible roles, omitting all Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments that are explicitly detailed in the ground truth (e.g., AM as A in multiple rows, CO as C in Receive Application, FC as C in KYC Review); (3) Includes unwarranted introductory and closing text, adding extraneous content; (4) Headers include abbreviations (e.g., "(AM)") absent in the ground truth; (5) Lacks bolding on key R/A entries and precise table alignment/formatting as shown. These differences render the output a partial, non-compliant RACI matrix, warranting a severe deduction for incompleteness and deviation from the expected full, detailed structure.
