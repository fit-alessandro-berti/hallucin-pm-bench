**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses *exactly* the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) with no leaks or synonyms. This adheres to the strict policy.
- **Table structure and activities (major violations, -4.0)**: 
  - Adds unauthorized activities ("Compliance Officer approval", "Schedule the payment", "Release the funds", "Notify the originating analyst") – direct violation of "do not ... add activities."
  - Renames/misleads: "approval" (lowercase, not bolded as "**Compliance Officer Approval**"); splits "Release Funds" into extras; omits exact ground truth phrasing.
  - 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6; includes narrative details (e.g., "schedule", "notify") not matrix-mapped in ground truth.
- **RACI assignments (severe inaccuracies, -2.5)**: Mismatches in ~80% of cells across shared activities:
  | Activity | Key Differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Officer: I vs –; Treasury: – vs I |
  | KYC Review | Front: C vs –; Officer: I vs C; Treasury: – vs I |
  | AML Screening | Front: I vs –; Treasury: – vs I |
  | Risk Scoring | Front: I vs C; Compliance: R/A vs R; Officer: C vs **A** |
  | Extras | All 4 added rows invalid; no ground truth equivalents. |
  - No partial credit for "similarities" (e.g., Compliance often R/A) – strictness demands exact matches.
- **Formatting (minor but penalized, -0.5)**: 
  - R/A vs **R, A** (wrong notation, no bolding).
  - – vs — (inconsistent dashes).
  - No bolded activity names/headers; narrower columns; plain text vs. emphasized.
- **Overall fidelity**: Captures core 4 activities but deviates critically on scope, accuracy, and precision. Ground truth is the benchmark; differences are substantial, not minor. Baseline 10.0 minus deductions = 3.0.
