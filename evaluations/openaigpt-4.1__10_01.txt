5.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**  
- The answer strictly adheres to the vocabulary policy: it uses only the allowed terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") and does not mention the forbidden terms.
- The matrix format is correct and clean.

**Errors and Issues (each resulting in significant point loss):**  
1. **RACI Allocations Are Oversimplified and Incomplete:**  
   - The LLM answer only uses "R/A" (presumably meaning both Responsible and Accountable) per activity for a single role, and leaves the rest blank. The ground truth provides a full RACI spread per activity, with C (Consulted) and I (Informed) assignments, and clear distinctions between R and A where needed. The LLM does NOT provide C or I roles anywhere.
   - In some activities, more than one party can be consulted or informed, which the LLM does not capture.
2. **Legend Inaccuracy:**  
   - The legend only explains "R" and "A", yet the matrix entries are "R/A", conflated into one, which is not standard RACI notation. The ground truth specifies where to use "R", "A", "C", or "I".
3. **Omissions:**  
   - The LLM neglects the detail included in the ground truth matrix, such as who is C and I on each activity, reducing the matrix's usefulness and accuracy.
   - "Record Update" and "Notify Customer" are not correctly assigned: the LLM says "R/A" for the primary actor only, leaving the support roles empty, when the ground truth includes Consulted and Informed roles.

**Conclusion:**  
- A major flaw is the LLM’s oversimplification: it does not deliver a full, correct RACI matrix as required, and misses the nuanced assignments required by the process narrative and ground truth.
- Vocabulary is perfectly followed, which saves the answer from an even lower score.
- Because the RACI allocations are not right—and because correct role distributions are at the core of a RACI matrix and process-mapping consulting—a **5.0** reflects this fundamental shortfall while giving partial credit for correct terminology and format.
