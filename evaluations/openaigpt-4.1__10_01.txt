3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Strong, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with proper capitalization and avoids all forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). This fully aligns with the strict policy.
- **Matrix Structure and Content (Partial, +1.5 points)**: The basic table format is present (activities as rows, roles as columns, no extra tasks/roles/columns introduced). It correctly identifies one primary Responsible/Accountable (R/A) per activity based on the process narrative (e.g., AM for Receive Application, CO for KYC Review). However, it severely underdelivers on a complete RACI matrix by leaving most cells blank, omitting Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments entirely. This results in an incomplete and non-standard RACI, ignoring the expectation of full role assignments per activity (e.g., ground truth shows CO as C for Receive Application and Order Vetting, FC as C for KYC Review, etc.). The combined "R/A" notation is acceptable where both apply but does not compensate for the gaps.
- **Adherence to Narrative and RACI Principles (Weak, -2.0 points overall impact)**: While it reflects the primary handlers from the description, it fails to infer or assign the full RACI details implied by a comprehensive matrix (e.g., no accountability for AM in Payment Clearance or Record Update; no I/C for secondary roles). The ground truth explicitly shows one Responsible per activity and broader consultations/informations, which the LLM ignores. This is a fundamental error for a RACI matrix.
- **Unwarranted Content (Minor deduction, -0.5 points)**: Includes introductory text ("Certainly! Here is...") and an offer for explanations, which adds fluff not requested. The legend is helpful but incomplete (only defines R/A, ignoring C/I). No major extras like new columns, but this slightly bloats the response.
- **Formatting and Clarity (Adequate, +0.5 points)**: Table is readable with basic Markdown, but lacks the ground truth's bolding for emphasis on key terms/R entries and has inconsistent spacing (e.g., "R/A" without slashes in some views). Minor but noticeable under strict scrutiny.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: As per instructions, even partial completeness (missing ~70% of cell assignments) warrants significant deduction. The answer gets the "what" right but not the "how" of a full RACI, leading to a low-mid score. No self-awareness issues apply.
