**2.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 but provides invalid, impossible sequences (e.g., T1 → T5; T5 requires P5 token absent post-T1). Contradictory/typo-ridden (e.g., "[T5]", "Tion sequence", "tiered transitions"). Lacks markings, proper minimal sequence (ground truth: T1,T2,T7,T4,T5), and valid explanation. Major factual errors on core demonstration violate strict criteria. Far exceeds ground truth fidelity.
