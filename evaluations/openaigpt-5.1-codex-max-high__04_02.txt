**6.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correct status and valid justifications (≤20 words) for R1, R3, R4, R5, R6. Overall conclusion matches (NON-COMPLIANT). Format closely follows prompt (per-rule labels + short justification + all-caps conclusion).
- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **R2**: Incorrect status (**Compliant** vs. **Violated**). Justification ignores Change_Request triggering new Manager_Approval (event 8, 2025-03-07) as the "last required approval"; Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) precedes it, violating the 2-day rule post-final approval. This shows failure to integrate R5 implications—core analytical flaw.
- **Minor Issues (further deductions)**: R1/R5 justifications add unneeded details (e.g., specific approvers/dates/names) not in ground truth, slightly deviating; no bolding as in prompt example, but acceptable.
- **Strictness Applied**: One rule's status + justification fully mismatched = ~30-40% penalty (fundamental compliance misjudgment). 5/6 rules accurate = baseline 8+, adjusted down for severity and interdependence of rules. Perfect match required for 10.0.
