The LLM answer attempts the core idea of adding a timer event and a bypass flow to Task_Triage for escalation but diverges significantly from the ground truth: wrong event type and position (intermediate catch after Task_Check vs. interrupting boundary on Task_Receive), incorrect timer start timing (post-Check delays total >48h from submission vs. near-submission), vague/inconsistent flow modifications (alters f3 and confuses f3a routing vs. single new flow), and unnecessary GW_Docs reference (already post-Check). These errors break SLA compliance and BPMN validity, warranting major deduction despite shared high-level intent.
