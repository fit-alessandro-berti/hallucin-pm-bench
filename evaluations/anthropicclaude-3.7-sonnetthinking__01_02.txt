### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall, accurately identifying the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and their branching logic, while listing all required documents exactly as specified in the prompt without introducing extraneous terminology. It adheres closely to the activity names and avoids standard loan terms. However, under utmost strictness, deductions apply for the following differences from the ground truth (and prompt fidelity):

#### Decision Points (moderate alignment, -1.5 points total):
- **Structure and precision**: The LLM correctly summarizes the branches but omits explicit flow context from the ground truth, e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for Underwriter Alignment Gate and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for Amount Threshold Decision. This reduces clarity on process sequence (-0.7).
- **Phrasing omissions**: In Underwriter Alignment Gate, the LLM escalates to "Harmonisation Committee" but drops "for a tie-break decision" (present in both prompt and ground truth) (-0.4). For Amount Threshold Decision, "proceed to" vs. ground truth's "send to" is a minor rephrasing (-0.2), and it lacks emphasis on the ≥ €15,000 cases in the MBA description being implicit rather than restated.
- **Minor additions**: Specifying "Continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check" is accurate but not in the ground truth, which keeps it general as "continue"; this is interpretive but not erroneous (-0.2).

#### Required Documents (high fidelity, -0.3 points total):
- The list is complete and matches the prompt's exact six items without additions like the ground truth's extraneous note on exclusions (which is helpful but not required).
- Small phrasing variances: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" includes "old" (matching prompt) while ground truth shortens to "(≤ 3 months)" (-0.1); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" adds "single" (prompt-accurate) vs. ground truth's omission (-0.1); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes "template" (prompt) vs. ground truth's "(CIS)" (-0.1). These are precise to the source but diverge slightly from the ground truth's brevity.

The response is concise, well-formatted, and directly addresses the prompt without hallucination or deviation into standard loan processes. A perfect score would require verbatim flow positioning and phrasing from the ground truth, with no interpretive expansions.
