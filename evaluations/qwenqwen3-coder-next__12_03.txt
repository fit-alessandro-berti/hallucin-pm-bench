The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in correctness, completeness, and adherence to the task (clear **No** answer + justification citing exact relevant CaseIDs C002/C004 with precise activity sequences from the log, plus explicit note on compliant cases C001/C003 to refute "always"). Stylistic differences (prose/bullets vs. table; minor timestamp inclusion/abbreviation) are present but do not introduce errors, omissions, or inaccuracies—both rely solely on log evidence, cover all cases implicitly/explicitly, and invalidate the FACT equivalently under utmost strict evaluation. No deductions warranted.
