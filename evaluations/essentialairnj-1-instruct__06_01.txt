The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines and Create_Documentation — Quality_Check), with no extras or omissions, matching the rationale and ground truth content. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Intra-pair alphabetical order violated**: The second pair is reversed ("Quality_Check — Create_Documentation" instead of "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check"), a direct instruction breach (C precedes Q).
- **Overall list alphabetical order violated**: Pairs listed as P-first then Q-first, instead of C-first then P-first.
- **Formatting differences**: Insufficient spacing for alignment (e.g., "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" vs. ground truth's tabbed "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"); inconsistent dashes/spaces.

These are not small errors—ordering is explicitly bolded/required, causing significant deductions (3.0 off for ordering violations, 0.5 for formatting). Content accuracy prevents lower score.
