**9.2**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b are **exactly** correct (deterministic numerics match ground truth precisely, including rounding, with clear calculations shown). For 3, it stays ≤100 words (48 words), uses only log data, mentions single-occurrence ("only in one case"), notes instability implicitly via low-frequency risks like overestimation/bias in models (aligning with variance issues), and cautions against over-generalisation (misleading performance/predictive analyses when generalising). Minor deduction (-0.8) for lacking explicit process-mining ties (e.g., cycle time skew, confidence intervals, noise) and ground truth's depth, per strict criteria. Structure/formatting enhances clarity.
