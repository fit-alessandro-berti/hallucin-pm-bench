The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the core content of the ground truth perfectly (tasks, order, and completeness). Deduction of 1.0 point for minor formatting differences: lacks descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), backticks around task names, ‖ symbol for parallelism (uses comma instead), and the closing confirmation sentence. These are small stylistic variances but warrant a strict penalty per instructions.
