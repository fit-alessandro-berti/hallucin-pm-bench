### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core factual differences (added tasks: check_vip, generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for the following differences from the ground truth:

- **Task listings incomplete**: Lists only task IDs (e.g., "check_vip") without including the exact `name` attributes from the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). This omits key factual details present in the XML and mirrored in the ground truth, treating the changes superficially rather than fully. (-2.0 points)
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses plain lines under headings without bullet points (*) or inline ID formatting (e.g., backticks), and headings include the specified "â€¢" prefix while ground truth uses bolded headings without it. Lists lack the structured * bullets. (-0.5 points)
- **Gateway description less precise**: Phrasing ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway") is concise but lacks the explicit versioning ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)") and formatting (backticks, bold) in the ground truth, reducing clarity and exactness. (-0.5 points)

No other categories (e.g., no erroneous additions or speculation) are present, so no further deductions. Overall, the answer is factually accurate but lacks completeness and matching presentation, warranting a mid-range score.
