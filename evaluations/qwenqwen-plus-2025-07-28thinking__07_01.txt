7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the factual differences and their categories, but loses significant points for the following reasons:

1. **Task names omitted:** It only lists the task element IDs for added and removed tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`) instead of using the full element names and IDs as in the snippets and ground truth (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)").
2. **Formatting deviates:** The LLM does not follow the requested format by omitting category headers' bold formatting, using bullets instead of the exact required format, and not including the IDs in the same way.
3. **Gateway change format:** The gateway type change is presented informally, not matching the exact template given in the ground truth.
4. **Consistency with requirements:** The answer lacks full adherence to the system instructions regarding precision and format fidelity.

All substantive content is correct, but these presentation and specificity errors are significant under strict grading.
