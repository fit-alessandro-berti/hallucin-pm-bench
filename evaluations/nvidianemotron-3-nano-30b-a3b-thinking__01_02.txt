8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: Correctly identifies the exact 3 decision points using precise activity names (no introductions of standard terminology). Lists all 6 required documents matching the source terminology closely, with no omissions or extras.
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Decision point summaries lack precision and context vs. ground truth: e.g., misses "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and specific underwriter names/ "≤ 2" phrasing (-0.8); omits "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check," exact "< €15 000"/"≥ €15 000," "system auto-approves," and specifies "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval" instead of vague "triggers the next step" (-1.0); minor MBA formatting/capitalization diff (-0.2).
  - Structure/format diffs: Bullets/titles vs. numbered headers "####" (-0.3).
  - Documents: Minor phrasing variances (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)"; "(single pay‑stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)") and lacks ground truth's parenthetical note (-0.2).
- Overall: Very close match (~85% fidelity), but small-to-medium precision/context errors warrant significant deductions per instructions.
