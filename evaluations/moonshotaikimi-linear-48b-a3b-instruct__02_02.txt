### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Q1 (Distinct cases: 3)**: Exact match to ground truth. No differences. Full points.
- **Q2 (Sequence for C002)**: Core sequence (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order) is factually correct and uses the required "→" separator. However, the LLM omits spaces around each "→" (e.g., "Receive_Order→Check_Stock" vs. ground truth's "Receive_Order → Check_Stock"). This is a small formatting error per the ground truth rendering, warranting a significant deduction under strict rules (-0.5 points total impact).
- **Q3 (Preceding activities)**: Exact match. Distinct activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) are correctly identified, listed one per line, and alphabetically ordered (A before C). No bullets/dashes in LLM output, but the prompt specifies "one per line" without requiring them; ground truth's "-" and "<br>" appear to be presentation artifacts. No deduction here.
- **Overall Structure and Differences**: The core answers are precise and free of factual errors, hallucinations, or omissions (e.g., correct parsing of cases, sequences, and predecessors within cases). However, the response includes excessive reasoning, log reproduction, and analysis (not present in the concise ground truth table), making it verbose and structurally divergent. Bolded labels (**Q1:** etc.) and extra whitespace are minor additions not in ground truth. Under utmost strictness, this extraneous content counts as a significant deviation (-1.0 points total impact for non-conciseness and format mismatch). No criminal/offensive issues, but evaluation focuses purely on fidelity to ground truth.

Total: Perfect factual accuracy (10.0 base) minus 1.5 for strict deductions = 9.0.
