3.0

### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer attempts to model the core flow but contains critical structural errors, invalid XML, invented elements, and deviations from the description that significantly undermine fidelity to the ground truth and prompt. Under strict evaluation, these warrant a low score: the process logic after "Initial Diagnosis" is fundamentally broken (swapped/misnnamed branches, missing "Resolve Issue" for specialist path, reference to undefined task `t5`), names are inconsistently altered or embellished (e.g., "Resolve Issue (Specialist)" invents a variant not in the description), BPMN best practices are ignored (no condition expressions on gateway flows, unnecessary `serviceTask` type), and minor issues like extra namespaces, wrong `isExecutable` value, and verbose task names compound the problems. The XML parses but is invalid due to the dangling reference, and it exceeds the "exactly as stated" rule by adding unmentioned details while omitting key shared activities. Only partial credit for correctly placing the password-reset branch, confirmation gateway, and loop back to diagnosis prevents a 1.0.

### Key Differences (Line-by-Line Comparison to Ground Truth)
- **Header/Namespaces (Lines 1-2)**: LLM includes extraneous diagram-related xmlns (bpmndi, omgdi, omg) despite prompt forbidding diagram elements; ground truth omits them for conciseness. No targetNamespace in LLM. Minor deduction.
- **Process Element (Line 4)**: ID "SupportTicketProcess" vs. "support_ticket"; name "SupportTicketProcess" vs. "Support-Ticket"; `isExecutable="true"` vs. "false". Inaccurate metadata (-0.5).
- **Start Event (Line 5)**: Name "Customer Submits Ticket" embellishes vs. concise "Ticket Submitted". ID "s1" vs. "start" (-0.2).
- **Classification Task (Lines 6,14)**: Name "Classify Ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification" (misses "automatically"); flow IDs verbose. Slight inaccuracy (-0.3).
- **First Gateway (Lines 7,15-16)**: Name "Routing" vs. "Password Reset?" (too vague); no conditionExpressions (e.g., `<conditionExpression>yes</conditionExpression>`) on flows f3/f4 equivalents—ground truth includes them for clarity. Flows labeled "true/false" but without formal conditions (-0.5).
- **Password Reset Task (Lines 8,17)**: `serviceTask` type invented (prompt says task unless specified); name "Password Reset: Provide Reset Instructions" adds prefix vs. plain "Provide Reset Instructions". Flows to "t4" (confirm) correctly, but name bloat (-0.4).
- **Diagnosis Task (Line 19)**: Name matches "Initial Diagnosis", but subsequent logic fails.
- **Second Gateway & Branches (Lines 20-27)**: Catastrophic errors here:
  - Name "Decision" vs. "Resolved Internally?".
  - Branches inverted/misnamed: Description requires choice between "Resolve Issue" (direct) or "Forward to Specialist" then "Resolve Issue". LLM routes "true" to `t3` "Forward to Specialist" → undefined `t5` (XML error, no element defined—breaks specialist path entirely), and "false" to `s3` "Resolve Issue (Specialist)" (invents new task name/variant not in description; should share "Resolve Issue").
  - Ground truth correctly: gw2 → t4 "Resolve Issue" (yes) or t5 "Forward to Specialist" (no) → t4 "Resolve Issue" (shared activity, per line 6).
  - No conditions on flows. This core logic flaw alone justifies major deduction (-4.0).
- **Resolve/Forward Tasks**: As above, `s3` and undefined `t5` are hallucinations; ground truth uses single `t4` for all "Resolve Issue".
- **Confirm Task (Lines 28,30,32)**: ID "t4" reused confusingly; name matches but flows from multiple sources correctly in intent.
- **Third Gateway & End (Lines 29,31,33-34,36)**: Name "Customer Confirmation" close to "Customer Confirms?"; loop to `t2` (diagnosis) matches line 9 and f13. End name "Close Ticket" vs. "Ticket Closed". No conditions (-0.3). gw3 is extra (prompt specifies *two* decision points: classification and diagnosis; confirmation is third but implied by exclusive gateway for yes/no—LLM adds it correctly but ground truth includes it explicitly).
- **Overall**: 35 lines (under 40, ok); uses exclusive gateways for decisions (partial +); loop modeled (to diagnosis, +). But total inventions/misses: 7+ deviations in names/structure, invalid ref, no conditions. Score reflects ~30% alignment.
