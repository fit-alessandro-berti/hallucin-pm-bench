The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway type changes) with exact IDs, names, and type transitions matching the ground truth. However, it incurs point deductions for formatting inconsistencies: unnecessary dashes prefixed to headings (not present in ground truth), lack of bullet points (-) before each list item, and absence of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry. These small structural deviations, under strict evaluation criteria, warrant a moderate reduction despite perfect content accuracy.
