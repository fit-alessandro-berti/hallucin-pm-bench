5.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes, but it has several notable formatting errors compared to the much stricter requirements inferred from the ground truth:

1. **Heading Formatting:**  
   - The LLM answer uses dash-prefixed headings ("- ADDED TASKS", etc.), rather than the required format without a dash as in the ground truth ("ADDED TASKS").  
   - In the ground truth, the headings are in uppercase and not prefixed by a dash.

2. **Task/List Formatting:**  
   - The LLM answer lists added and removed tasks without dashes or bullets, whereas the ground truth uses a dash and a space before each item.
   - The LLM omits bullet points, which are present in the ground truth. This results in a significant structure mismatch.

3. **Gateway Type Changes Formatting:**  
   - The LLM omits dashes/bullets for items, but the ground truth requires each change to be on a new line and prefixed with a dash and space.
   - The spacing for “Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel” is not matched; the ground truth indents the gateway name with spaces, which the LLM answer ignores.

4. **Order and Verbosity:**  
   - The content ordering is the same and it is succinct, so no points deducted here.
   - It uses the correct task and gateway ids and names, so no deduction for content selection.
  
Due to these formatting discrepancies—especially the incorrect headings and the lack of required dashes/bullets—there is a significant deviation from the specified structure, which would be unacceptable in a strict professional compliance scenario. For this reason, the score is reduced substantially despite the correct substantive content.
