The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a valid, concise justification citing the key counter-example in case C003 (lines 6-7), which alone disproves the "always" claim by showing Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits the additional counter-example in case C005 (line 11), where Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order at all, which the ground truth explicitly highlights as another clear violation. This partial justification misses half of the comprehensive evidence in the ground truth, resulting in a significant deduction despite the core accuracy.
