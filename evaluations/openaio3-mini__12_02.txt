The LLM answer gives a correct "No" and clearly points out case C003 as a counterexample, with accurate line references. However, it omits mentioning case C005, which is a second important counterexample included in the ground truth answer. This omission shows incomplete coverage and thus warrants a significant deduction. The main reasoning is otherwise clear, concise, and factual.
