The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately cites the two relevant violated rules (2 and 3) with precise event references and rule interpretations, matching the ground truth's analysis of those violations. Rule 2 violation is explained identically (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods). For Rule 3, both describe the same distance exceedance (three intervening activities, distance >2), though the ground truth specifies "distance=3" explicitly. No factual errors exist.

However, under strict evaluation, the LLM answer loses a full point for incompleteness: it omits verification of the satisfied rules (1, 4, and 5), which the ground truth thoroughly documents with numbered justifications for all rules before concluding. This reduces comprehensiveness without altering correctness, as "relevant rules" could imply only violations but the ground truth sets a fuller standard. Minor formatting differences (e.g., no explicit overall conclusion restatement) are negligible.
