7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4**: Perfect match with ground truth (no differences, full accuracy).
- **Q5**: Significant error. The LLM incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list, which appears as the first event in case C-77 (per the log: the only event for C-77 is Quality_Check at 10:00). Ground truth correctly excludes it, listing only the three activities that truly never start a case (Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Ship_Order). This is a factual mistake in analysis, violating the "only use facts directly from the event-log" rule, and inflates the list unnecessarily. Under strict evaluation, this single but substantive error (wrong inclusion of a key activity) deducts heavily, as it misrepresents the log's structure and first events.
- **Overall**: 4/5 questions correct, but Q5's error is not minor—it's a clear misreading of case starts, warranting a ~30% deduction from a perfect 10.0 score. JSON format and structure are otherwise compliant.
