**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Correctness)**: Perfect match (1 occurrence). +2.8/3.0
- **Part 2 (Content & Fidelity)**: 
  - Strengths: Identifies small sample (3 cases, ~1.5 hrs; close to GT's <2 hrs/3 cases), non-representative snippet, naming inconsistencies with exact log examples ("Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). Under 120 words (~75). +2.4/4.0
  - Weaknesses (strict deductions): 
    - Misses precise quantification (14 events total; 1/3 cases = ~33% or 7% of events, 0%-7% swing with ±1 event; "wide confidence interval"; "extreme sampling error for rare events"). This is GT's core statistical insight—LLM is too vague/general.
    - Minor inaccuracy: Speculates "full log... may also use alternative names for **manual** fraud checks" (unsupported; log shows auto variants only, violating "no speculation").
    - No specifics on the occurrence (e.g., case 1002, timestamp).
    - Less emphasis on fuzzy/strict matching distortion.
  - Formatting minor mismatch (bolded vs. plain). -1.2 total deduction.
- **Overall**: Strong but lacks GT's analytical depth/precision; speculation and omissions cost significantly under strict criteria.
