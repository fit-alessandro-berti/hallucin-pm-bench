- The LLM answer includes all required changes, correctly identifies added/removed tasks and gateway changes.
- However, it omits the mandatory dash (-) before each list item, which is specifically demanded by the ground truth and prompt (“id followed by name in parentheses”), reflecting a lapse in required output format.
- It also does not align the colon/spaces for gateway changes to match the style *verbatim* as in the ground truth (missing the exact spacing after the colon for Gateway_Payment).
- These small, but concrete, formatting deviations constitute notable errors per the instructions for utmost strictness, warranting a significant points deduction despite fully correct content.
