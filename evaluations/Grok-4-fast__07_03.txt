The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with no extraneous content, guesses, or commentary, fully adhering to the prompt's content requirements. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for formatting differences from the ground truth: absence of bullet points ("-") before each list item across all sections (6 instances) and minor misalignment in spacing for the second gateway entry (lacking the extra spaces after the colon). These small deviations warrant a deduction despite the otherwise precise match.
