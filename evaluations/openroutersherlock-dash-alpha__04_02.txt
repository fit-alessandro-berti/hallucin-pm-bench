3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification accurate and concise (≤20 words). No deduction.
- **R2**: Status correct (Violated). But justification incorrect: Misinterprets timing by referencing initial Finance_Approval (03-04) instead of post-change final approval (03-07), ignoring rule's reset for expedited shipping window. Significant error; -1.5 points.
- **R3**: Status correct (Violated). Justification matches ground truth closely. No deduction.
- **R4**: Status wrong (Compliant vs. Not Applicable). When condition (hazardous=true) is false, rule is Not Applicable, not Compliant. Justification implies satisfaction but rule isn't triggered. Major error; -2.0 points.
- **R5**: Status wrong (Compliant vs. Violated). Justification flawed: Ignores Ship_Goods (03-05) and Pay_Invoice (03-06) as "further processing steps" after Change_Request (03-04) but before new Manager_Approval (03-07). Core rule misunderstanding; -2.5 points.
- **R6**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification accurate. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by R5 error (missed violation). Format mostly follows prompt but lacks exact structure (e.g., no table, but not required). Base score 10.0 minus deductions: 10 - 6 = 4.0, adjusted down to 3.0 for cumulative strictness on errors affecting compliance analysis.
