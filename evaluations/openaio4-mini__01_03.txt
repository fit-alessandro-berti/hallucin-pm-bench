6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (8.5/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies both decision points and summarizes their rules accurately in one sentence each, closely aligning with the ground truth. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "bypasses the Manual Underwriting Review; otherwise it proceeds to it" vs. ground truth's "bypasses...; otherwise it proceeds to that review") and not bolding/formatting exactly like the ground truth, but the content is substantively correct with no omissions or errors.
- **Part (b) - Documents (3.5/10)**: Significant omissions undermine completeness. The LLM lists only 6 documents, missing the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) which are explicitly required as inputs in step 3 and appear before the Deck Memo. This is a major error, as the task demands **all** documents in first-appearance order. The listed items are correct where included (e.g., distinguishing Signed Offer Sheet 77 from the unsigned version), with no hallucinations, but the incompleteness (3 out of 9 items missing) warrants heavy deduction under strict criteria.
- **Overall**: Strong on (a) but critically flawed on (b), averaging to a mid-tier score. No evidence of hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML items), but the prompt emphasizes utmost strictness for any differences.
