4.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision points:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies and accurately describes both decision points, clearly explaining the risk-and-amount-related skip and the TriVote gate with required approvals. The wording is precise and does not contain errors or misstatements versus the ground truth. This part is essentially correct.

**b) List of all documents in order of first appearance:**
- Here, the answer is significantly incomplete. The LLM omits the three Scorecard documents (**Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow**) that are explicitly required inputs for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check step.
- The remaining documents are mostly correct and in the right order:
    - "Form 14B" (correct)
    - "Deck Memo" (should actually come after the three Scorecards)
    - "Offer Sheet 77," "Signed Offer Sheet 77," "ID Matrix Declaration," "Loan Dossier 2025" (all present and in correct relative order)
- However, absence of the three Scorecard documents is a major factual and process error.
- There is also a minor order error: "Deck Memo" should be after the three Scorecards.

**Summary:**  
- No hallucinated documents, which is good.
- Omits three essential documents unique to the process (Scorecards).
- Minor ordering issue on the list due to omitted Scorecards and order of "Deck Memo."

Given the strictness requested and the definition that "even small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," omission of three required documents (almost 1/3 of the correct document list) warrants a severe penalty, even if the decisions section is solid.

**Thus, the score is 4.0.**
