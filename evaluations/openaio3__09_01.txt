The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core content, accurately stating that the average cycle time cannot be derived/computed due to the absence of timestamps or elapsed-time data in the redacted log. It directly addresses both the query's requested value and the explanation, mirroring the ground truth's reasoning on missing temporal information. Minor deductions for slight phrasing variations (e.g., "requested statistic cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; inclusion of "sequencing" without exactly matching "ordering information"; omission of the explicit warning against fabricating a numeric answer) and less formatted emphasis (no bolding or quotes), which introduce small but noticeable differences under strict evaluation.
