The LLM answer correctly states that the requested statistic cannot be derived from the provided data, explicitly pointing out that timestamps or elapsed time information are missing. It explains that without these values, computing an average duration is not possible. This matches the ground truth answer both in conclusion and in reasoning. No significant content is missing or misleading, and the strict criterion of not generating unsupported values is fully met.
