**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Major error in R2**: Status **Compliant** (wrong; ground truth **Violated**). Justification ignores Change_Request requiring new approval (07-Mar as last approval); Ship_Goods (05-Mar) precedes it and violates 2-day window post-last approval. Critical conceptual failure on rule interaction (-5.0+ deduction).
- **R1, R3, R4, R6**: Status and justification match closely (minimal deduction).
- **R5**: Status matches (**Violated**), justification correct but incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice; ground truth includes it; -0.5).
- **Overall**: Correct (**NON-COMPLIANT**), but misses listing violations explicitly as in ground truth note.
- **Format**: Matches prompt (bold status, ≤20-word justifications, all-caps conclusion).
- **Strictness applied**: Single major rule error + incomplete justification = severe penalty; 5/6 rules accurate insufficient for high score.
