The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in the exact order required, with no extraneous information about Processes A or C, aligning with the prompt's core request. However, it loses points for several strict deviations from the ground truth: (1) lack of descriptive labels (e.g., "Set 1 – first parallel block"), which provide clarity on the parallel constructs; (2) absence of the parallel symbol (‖) to explicitly denote concurrency branches, using commas instead; (3) no backticks or formatting for task names; and (4) omission of the confirmatory statement that no other tasks run in parallel, which ensures completeness against the process description. These formatting and structural differences, while minor, warrant a significant deduction under the utmost strictness guideline.
