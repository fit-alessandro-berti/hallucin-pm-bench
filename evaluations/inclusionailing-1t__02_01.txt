The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, demonstrating correct identification of distinct cases (3), the preceding activity for Ship_Order in A-9321 (Pack_Items), the earliest timestamp (2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00), and the count of Quality_Check occurrences (2). However, Q5 is partially incorrect: it correctly identifies Pack_Items and Ship_Order as never appearing as the first event but erroneously includes Quality_Check (which is the first—and only—event for case C-77) and omits Validate_Order (which never starts any case, appearing only after Receive_Order in A-9321 and B-1045). This constitutes a significant factual error in list composition, violating the prompt's strict reliance on log facts and leading to a deduction for incomplete accuracy despite the close overall match.
