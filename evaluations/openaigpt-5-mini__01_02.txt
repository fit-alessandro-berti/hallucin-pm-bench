### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major deductions for extras and structure)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the core three decision points from the ground truth (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval). However, it incorrectly adds Quick KYC Verification as a decision point, which is a linear verification step, not a branching decision (per process flow and ground truth omission). It also expands unnecessarily on KYC outcomes ("if not confirmed, the application does not proceed") and MBA next steps ("proceed to Disburse Funds; if reject, declined"), introducing details not in the ground truth summary. Formatting uses bullets instead of numbered list with concise conditional phrasing, deviating from ground truth style. This adds ~20-25% extraneous content, warranting a significant penalty under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents (minor deductions for phrasing)**: The list is complete and matches all items, using exact names without introducing standard terminology. However, small wording variances penalize strictly: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's "(≤ 3 months)"; "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" (adds "single"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (adds "template"). Ground truth includes an explanatory note on exclusions, which LLM omits but isn't strictly required—still, phrasing inconsistencies reflect imperfect fidelity.

Overall, the response is substantively accurate (~80% alignment) but undermined by additions, expansions, and non-identical phrasing, leading to a mid-range score with deductions for every deviation as instructed.
