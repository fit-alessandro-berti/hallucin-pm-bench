6.0

The LLM answer is generally accurate but not strict enough in adhering to the instructions and structure of the process as described in the "ground truth" answer.

**Strengths:**
- All required documents are correctly listed using exact names and order.
- The answer reflects all the actual decision points in essentially the correct order.
- The step terminology is mostly accurate and the process does not introduce prohibited standard loan terms.

**Deficiencies and point losses:**
- The answer introduces "Quick KYC Verification (KYC)" as a decision point, which is NOT treated as a formal decision point in the ground truth answer—this is a significant deviation.
- Describes some specific conditional outcomes in prose ("If not confirmed, does not proceed") that are not specified in the ground truth, thus introduces extra nuance.
- Structure differs from the ground truth: the numbering and step groupings do not strictly match.
- Wording of decisions is occasionally less precise (e.g., “proceed to Community Impact Assessment (CIA)" is not a decision branch per the official flow).
- The explicit decision split/branch language in the official flow ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split", "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval") is replaced by more casual prose, losing some fidelity.
- Minor terminology slips in describing outcomes (e.g., “application is declined” for MBA rejection—where the official flow simply records “Reject”), which can be penalized on a strict reading.

Given the instructions to grade with utmost strictness where even minor errors mean significant loss of points, the answer is accurate but not fully faithful to the required structure or process, meriting a 6.0.
