**2.0**

The LLM answer fails on multiple critical points with strict deduction:
- **Invalid BPMN**: Proposes "intermediateCatchEvent on sequence flow f1" – BPMN does not support timer catch events directly "on flows"; invalid construct (-2.0).
- **Wrong timer placement/type**: Places on f1 (Start→Receive) vs. ground truth's interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive (-1.5); misses SLA start from submission but timer activation mismatch.
- **No auto-escalation**: Suggests "manually intervene" vs. ground truth's automatic flow to Task_Triage (-2.0); violates "auto-escalated".
- **Ineffective for SLA**: Doesn't bypass Check/GW/RequestDocs loop; vague "safeguard" without direct Triage path (-1.5).
- **Minor**: Partial ID refs ok, but no new flow to Triage; word count fine. Total major deviations justify low score.
