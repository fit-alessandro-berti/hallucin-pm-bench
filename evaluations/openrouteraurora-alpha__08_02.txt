**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth: correct "Yes" for Q1, identical minimal sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] reaching {P2, P5} before T5 fires (with T3 unfired), and accurate step-by-step explanation confirming T5 precedes T3. Stylistic differences (e.g., no explicit Mi markings, minor wording like "tokens in P2 (and P5)" vs. set notation) are present but convey the exact same markings, logic, and validity without errors or omissions. Word limit followed. No deductions needed under strict evaluation, as content matches perfectly.
