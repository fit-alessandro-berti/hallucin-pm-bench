2.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect match, +2.0 points base)**: Uses exactly "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring". No leaks or synonyms.
- **Structure & formatting (major deductions, -3.0)**: Markdown table present but lacks GT's bolding (**R, A**, activity names), long padded headers, and uses empty cells instead of "–". Extra explanatory note violates "do not add" (implicitly clean output).
- **Activities (severe mismatch, -3.5)**: 8 rows vs GT's 6. Adds "Schedule the payment" and "Notify the originating analyst" (unmatched in GT). Renames "Approval" (generic vs GT's "Compliance Officer Approval"); "Release the funds" vs "Release Funds". No merge/add/rename allowed—LLM violates all three.
- **RACI assignments (critical errors, -4.0)**: ~70% cells differ. Examples:
  | Activity | Key diffs |
  |----------|-----------|
  | Intake Vetting | Misses Compliance C, Treasury I; Officer empty vs – |
  | Risk Scoring | Compliance R,A vs R only (+ Officer A, Front C) |
  | KYC/AML Screening | Misses Officer C, Treasury I each |
  | Approval/Release | Partial overlap but misses Front I (Approval), Compliance C/Front I/Officer C (Release); extra Treasury I |
  No cell perfectly matches GT (bolding, exact roles, – usage).
- **Overall fidelity**: Interpretive RACI diverges sharply (LLM autonomous R/A heavy; GT distributed C/I/A). Covers "every activity" but mismatches GT's selection. Small errors (e.g., commas "R, A" vs spacing, phrasing) compound to significant loss. Total reflects ~25% alignment.
