7.0

- **Identification of Activities:** The LLM accurately identifies the three worst-performing activities: Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment. This matches the ground truth.
- **Explanation (Why Underperform):** The explanations are generally aligned with the dashboard data—highlighting wait times, rework %, and SLA breaches. However, the answer sometimes compresses critical details (e.g., "Review_Documents" explanation omits the high pre-step wait time and emphasizes processing variability, but does not mention the 30 min queue), and does not mention throughput drops, which the ground truth does.
- **Recommendations:** The actions are plausible and tie back to the data, but are somewhat less specific and concrete than the ground truth (for instance, suggesting an "automated portal" generally vs. the ground truth's "automatic, same-day digital requests with mandatory file-format validation"). Likewise, references to a "rotating specialist squad" or detailed throughput/SLA projections are missing.
- **Missing Specifics/Impact Statement:** The memo does not cite specific figures from the table (except as general descriptors like "longest wait time") and does not explicitly quantify the projected impact of changes, both of which are clear strengths of the ground truth.
- **Language and Tone:** The memo keeps within the word limit and maintains executive-level conciseness.

**Deductions:**  
- Missing some explicit figures from the source table that would help anchor arguments.
- Less concrete recommendations and a lack of measurable outcomes in the action items.
- Missed throughput data drops as a factor.
- Some lower-level details and table cross-references omitted.
- Lack of clear explanation when numbers are close (directive in the prompt).

**Summary:** Solid structural match, accurate activity selection, and data-driven reasoning, but weaker on detail, quantification, and recommendation specificity compared to the ground truth—hence a strict 7.0.
