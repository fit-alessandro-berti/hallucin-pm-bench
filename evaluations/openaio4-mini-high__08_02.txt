The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) as the ground truth for Q2, with a concise, accurate explanation that traces token movements and confirms T5's preconditions met without T3 firing. It adheres to the ≤120-word limit. Minor deductions for omitting detailed markings (M₁ to M₅) and the post-T5 disabling insight, which add confirmatory depth in the ground truth, per strict evaluation criteria. No factual errors.
