The LLM answer correctly answers both questions and provides a minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) that matches the ground truth. The explanation gives sufficient reasoning why T5 can fire before T3, referencing the alternative path and token availability.

However, some minor flaws compared to the ground truth:
- The LLM answer lacks explicit marking updates (no states M₁...M₅).
- The LLM answer’s explanation, though correct, is slightly less precise than the ground truth in clarifying that T5 disables T3 after firing.
- The wording is less formal (e.g., "P5 exists"), and explanation could be tightened.

Due to these small but clear discrepancies in explanation detail and notation, a deduction is warranted. Overall, the core logic is fully correct.
