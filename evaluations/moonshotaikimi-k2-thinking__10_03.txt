3.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and fidelity to the prompt's constraints, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Key differences include:

- **Activities (Major Errors, -4.0 points base penalty)**: The prompt mandates covering "every activity" without renaming, merging, or adding. The ground truth identifies 6 activities (4 core mandated terms + "Compliance Officer Approval" + "Release Funds", merging scheduling/release per narrative flow). The LLM adds 2 extras ("Payment Scheduling" and "Notify Originating Analyst"), splits "Release Funds" into two rows, and omits nuanced merging. This violates "do not add" and "do not merge," creating 8 rows instead of 6. Core terms are used correctly (no vocabulary leaks, +1.0 minor credit), but extras introduce unprompted elements.

- **RACI Assignments (Multiple Errors, -2.0 points)**: Assignments mismatch in 70%+ of cells:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM (Front RA, Compliance I) vs. Ground Truth (Front R,A; Compliance C; Treasury I). Misses Compliance C (Consulted) and Treasury I; treats I as equivalent to C (not true in RACI—Informed is passive, Consulted is active input). Officer empty vs. dash (equivalent, neutral).
  - **KYC Review/AML Screening**: LLM (Compliance RA; Front/ Officer I) vs. Ground Truth (Compliance R,A; Officer C; Treasury I; Front –). Front I (wrong involvement) vs. –; Officer I vs. C; misses Treasury I. Both activities identical in errors.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM (Compliance RA; others I) vs. Ground Truth (Compliance R; Officer A; Front C; Treasury I). Fails to split R/A (Compliance responsible for derivation, Officer accountable for escalation); Front C (consulted on inputs) missed; over-assigns I broadly.
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Minor alignment (both have Officer RA, Compliance C, Front I), but LLM adds unneeded Treasury I vs. – (-0.5).
  - Extras ("Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Notify"): Not in ground truth; LLM's RA for Treasury aligns partially with "Release Funds" but splits unnecessarily, diluting accuracy.
  Overall, inconsistent RACI logic (e.g., narrative implies Officer accountability for high-risk scoring/escalation, missed).

- **Formatting and Presentation (Minor Errors, -0.5 points)**: Uses abbreviations (RA, I, C) vs. ground truth's explicit "R, A" or combined forms—acceptable per RACI standards but not matching (strictness deducts). No bolding on activities/R,A cells as in ground truth. Empty cells vs. dashes (–) is functionally similar but not identical. Headers slightly misaligned (e.g., spacing, role names). Markdown table is valid but lacks ground truth's polish.

- **Overall Fidelity (Holistic, No Additional Credit)**: Captures narrative roles but infers incorrectly (e.g., no distinction in Risk Scoring accountability; adds "Notify" despite it being post-release notification, not a core activity). Vocabulary policy followed perfectly (no synonyms like "Preliminary Assessment"), preventing total failure. However, cumulative errors (extras, wrong involvements, I/C swaps) make it ~60% divergent, unsuitable for strict governance use.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts for violations (net 3.5). Even small mismatches (e.g., I vs. C) reflect significant process risks in a compliance context, justifying harsh scoring.
