9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies all substantive changes: three added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), one removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision. It adheres strictly to the three required headings and ignores irrelevant details like name changes or flows, as instructed.

However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.0 point for minor presentation differences from the ground truth:
- Uses bullet points instead of numbered lists.
- Task phrasing is "Task with id='X' ('Name')" versus ground truth's "**Name** (`id`)" format.
- Gateway description uses XML tags (`<exclusiveGateway>` to `<inclusiveGateway>`) instead of descriptive terms ("exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)") with version references (*v1* to *v2*).
- Lacks the ground truth's final parenthetical note.

These are small formatting and stylistic variances, but per instructions, they warrant a significant (though not drastic) deduction despite perfect content accuracy. No factual errors or omissions.
