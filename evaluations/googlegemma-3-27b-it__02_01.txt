The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1â€“Q4, demonstrating accurate extraction of distinct case counts, preceding activities, earliest timestamps, and activity frequencies directly from the log. However, Q5 contains a clear factual error: "Quality_Check" is incorrectly included in the list, as it appears as the first event in case C-77 (the only event for that case, at 2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00). This violates the instruction to use only facts directly readable from the log and indicates a failure to properly identify starting activities per case after sorting events by timestamp. The inclusion of this extraneous item makes Q5 substantially inaccurate (3 correct items out of 4, with one wrongly added), warranting a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria despite the overall strong performance.
