8.0

The LLM answer is nearly correct, with only one significant error in Q5: "Quality_Check" is incorrectly included in the list of activities that never appear as the first event of any case. However, in the log, "Quality_Check" is the first event for case "C-77", so it should not be listed.

All other answers (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) are exactly correct, matching the ground truth.

Because a single, but clear, mistake is present that affects the correctness of the output, I deduct 2 full points, for a strict score of 8.0.
