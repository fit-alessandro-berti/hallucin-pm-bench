**9.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on all rule statuses (R1 Compliant, R2/R3/R5 Violated, R4 Not Applicable, R6 Compliant) and overall NON-COMPLIANT. Format follows the prompt exactly (bold status + ≤20-word justification per rule). 

Minor differences in justifications deduct 1.0 point under utmost strictness:
- R2: Different emphasis (LLM: before re-approval/not after last; GT: specific dates/>2 days). Both correct but wording diverges.
- R5: LLM cites only Ship_Goods; GT includes Ship_Goods *and* Pay_Invoice (omission of one valid example).

All other justifications (R1, R3, R4, R6) are semantically equivalent or near-identical. No factual errors.
