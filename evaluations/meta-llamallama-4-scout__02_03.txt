### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (exact count and cases listed). Full points.
- **Question 2**: Perfect match (correct activity identified concisely). Full points.
- **Question 3**: Core identification of "Cancel_Order" is correct, but significant deductions for lack of conciseness (rambling paragraph instead of bullet-point), plural phrasing implying multiple activities when only one exists, and errors/confusion in intermediate reasoning (e.g., incorrectly pondering "Create_Order" as potentially unique before self-correcting; garbled mention of "Validate_Order" appearances). This deviates substantially from the ground truth's precise, minimal format, warranting a major penalty under strict criteria.
