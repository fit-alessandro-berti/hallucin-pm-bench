8.0

- Correct for Q1: The answer gives the correct count and lists all three cases. (Perfect)
- Correct for Q2: The answer specifies "Pack_Items" as the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" for C456. (Perfect)
- Q3: The LLM answer is partially verbose and slightly confusing. It lists "Cancel_Order" (correct) but then digresses into unnecessary details about Create_Order and the logic behind exclusion. This extra and poorly structured explanation introduces some confusion, though it correctly settles on "Cancel_Order" as the only activity appearing exactly once, just as in the ground truth.

However, since the bullet for Q3 contains unnecessary (and slightly muddled) explanation and formatting, and only at the end gives the correct answer, I deduct 2 points for lack of strict conciseness as required by the prompt and some ambiguity in enumeration.

**Summary:**  
- Q1: 10/10  
- Q2: 10/10  
- Q3: 6/10 (correct, but messy and not truly "concise, bullet-point")  
**Average:** 8.0
