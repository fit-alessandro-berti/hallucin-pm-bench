### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correctness (full marks)**: LLM correctly answers "Yes" with the exact required firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5), accurately describing enabling conditions (p3 token present, p4=0), and notes T3 has not fired. No factual errors; satisfies prompt's "concrete firing sequence" and "justify briefly."
- **Differences causing deductions (strictness applied)**:
  - **Missing detail in states/markings (-0.3)**: LLM describes token movements verbally but omits explicit marking notation (e.g., GT's `p1=1, p2=1`), reducing clarity despite safe net assumptions.
  - **Incomplete sequence (-0.2)**: LLM stops at T5 (sufficient for "before T3"); GT extends to T3/T4 for fuller context, highlighting post-T5 behavior.
  - **Weaker justification (-0.2)**: LLM's brief note on conditions is adequate but lacks GT's deeper insight (enabling rule `p3 ≥1 ∧ p4=0`, permanent disablement after T3, "must" before T3). Prompt asks "briefly," but GT sets higher bar for completeness.
  - **Formatting/style (-0.1)**: LLM uses numbered list with descriptions; GT uses bold transitions + precise arrows/markings for superior readability.
- **Overall**: Near-perfect match on core requirements (sequence + basic why), but strict diff-matching to verbose GT yields minor losses. No "small errors" per se, but presentation/detail gaps penalized significantly as instructed.
