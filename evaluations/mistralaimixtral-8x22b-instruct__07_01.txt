8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, gateway `gw_valid` type change from exclusive to inclusive), using exact element IDs from the XML as required. Headings match the prompt exactly, including bullets and bolding. Gateway description is concise and accurate.

Deductions (-2.0 total):
- Unnecessary introductory sentence (-1.0).
- Uses only IDs instead of names + IDs as in ground truth (-0.5).
- Minor phrasing/structure differences in gateway line and bullet style (-0.5). 

Semantically perfect with no speculation or extra differences reported; format close but not identical under strict criteria.
