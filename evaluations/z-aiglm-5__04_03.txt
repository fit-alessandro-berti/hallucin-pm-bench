**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct, complete, and matches the ground truth in all factual assessments (correct "No", identical rule-by-rule evaluations with the same violation identified for Rule 3, and accurate reasoning for satisfaction/violation of each rule). Minor stylistic differences (bullets vs. table; explicit "overall non-compliant" reiteration absent but implied by "No" and violation list) do not constitute errors under the prompt's requirements for "Yes/No" + "short justification referencing each rule," as the substance is identical with no deviations in logic, references, or conclusions.
