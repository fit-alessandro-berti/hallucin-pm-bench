### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct identification of changes (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies the added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway type change for `gw_valid` (from exclusive to inclusive). This matches the core factual differences without speculation or extraneous details.
- **Major deductions for presentation and detail omissions**: 
  - **Task listings incomplete**: Lists only IDs (e.g., `- `check_vip``), omitting the exact `name` attributes from the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" with `id = check_vip`), which the ground truth includes. The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," interpreted here as including both ID and name for full fidelity; this omission creates substantive differences.
  - **Heading format mismatch**: Uses `###` markdown instead of `**bold**` as in ground truth, deviating from the expected "exact headings."
  - **Bullet style inconsistency**: Uses `-` dashes vs. ground truth's `*` italics, a small but noticeable formatting error under strict evaluation.
  - **Gateway phrasing differences**: Simplified description lacks "(v1)" and "(v2)" versioning and bolding for types, making it less precise than ground truth.
  - **Extraneous content**: Includes an introductory sentence ("Here are the factual differences..."), not present in ground truth, violating the "group your answer under the exact headings" instruction implying direct structure.
  - **Missing closing note**: Omits the ground truth's "(No other differences should be reported.)" and parenthetical structure, reducing completeness.
- **No additions or errors in facts**: No incorrect changes reported, and categories with items are populated (no erroneous "(none)"), but strictness demands near-exact replication of ground truth structure and detail for full score. Overall, ~60% alignment, penalized heavily for incompleteness in task details and formatting.
