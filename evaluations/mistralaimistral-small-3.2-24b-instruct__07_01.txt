8.5

The LLM answer accurately listed the element IDs of the added and removed tasks and correctly identified the gateway type change using the correct element name (`gw_valid`). However, it did not mention the task names or task IDs in the itemized fashion used in the ground truth, omitting details such as "(id = `check_vip`)" or the explicit pairing of task name and ID. This is a minor, but relevant, omission given the strictness requested. The categorical grouping and difference identification are otherwise correct and nothing was added or missed regarding change content. Thus, a loss of 1.5 points is appropriate for the reduced informativeness.
