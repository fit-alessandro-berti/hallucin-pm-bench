8.0

### Evaluation Reasoning (Strict Assessment):
- **Factual correctness (high marks)**: Correctly identifies added tasks ("check_vip" and "generate_qr" via exact names), removed task ("send_rma_label" via exact name), and gateway change (gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway). No extra or missing changes; no speculation. Matches core facts perfectly (+10 base).
- **Headings**: Matches prompt's exact "• Added tasks" etc. precisely (+1.0), but differs from ground truth's "**Added tasks**" formatting (plain vs bold, bullet style).
- **Added/Removed tasks** (-1.5 total): Uses exact `name` attributes as required ("element names"), but omits `(id = ...)` details present in ground truth (2 for added, 1 for removed). Strict: these are factual XML elements; omission is a small but reportable difference.
- **Gateway type changes** (-0.5): Correct change description, but identifies via `name="Warranty Valid?"` instead of `id="gw_valid"` as in ground truth. Lacks "(v1)" "(v2)" versioning. Minor wording/formatting variance (no bold).
- **Other** (-0.0): No extraneous content; categories complete (no "(none)" needed). No final note as in ground truth, but not required by prompt.
- **Overall strictness**: Substantial factual alignment (90%+ match), but presentation/details diverge in 3/3 categories → 20% penalty. Perfect match would require exact phrasing, ids, bullets (*), bolding, and note.
