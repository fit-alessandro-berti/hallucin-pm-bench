**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies 3 decision points roughly aligning with process flow (triage eligibility check, finance approval, high-value threshold > €1 000 → auditor). Lists 6/7 documents accurately (*RefundRequestForm*, *FlightManifest*, *WeatherReport*, *EligibilityChecklist*, *AuditTrail* conditional note, *BankTransferAuthorization*). No introductions of undefined activities/artefacts. Follows prompt structure (decision points + documents).
- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **Decision points incomplete/inaccurate** (-1.5): Misses explicit branching logic/outcomes (e.g., no "eligible → continue; not → rejected" for triage #1; no rejection paths for finance/auditor approvals leading to process end without payment, as in ground truth #1/#3; finance framed as sequential requirement, not decision with approve/reject). High-value correct but lacks "after Finance_Controller_PreApprove" precision and ≤ €1 000 skip. Not "every" point summarized with outcomes.
  - **Documents omission** (-1.0): Misses *RefundConfirmationPDF* (ground truth #7, produced in final step; must be "complete list").
  - **Minor formatting/content drifts** (-0.5): Less precise phrasing (e.g., "Triage Agent Validation" vs. exact *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*; no table/numbered structure with logic; no disclaimer on no legacy activities).
- **Overall**: ~80% alignment but key omissions/incompletenesses in core requirements (full branches, all docs) warrant strict penalty below 8.0.
