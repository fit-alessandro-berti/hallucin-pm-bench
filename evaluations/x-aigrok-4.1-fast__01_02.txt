9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, faithfully summarizing all three decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval/MBA) with exact activity names and correct branching logic from the process description. It lists every required document completely and precisely matches the source prompt's phrasing (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)", "(single pay-stub or tax slip)", "(CIS) template"), which is actually more faithful than the ground truth in those details. No factual errors, no missing elements, no introduction of prohibited terminology.

Strict deductions (-1.0 total):
- **Structure** (-0.3): Uses headings, numbered 1-2 + unnumbered MBA section, and bullets for docs vs. ground truth's "####" subheadings, flat numbered 1-3 for decisions + numbered 1-6 for docs.
- **Decision points phrasing/context** (-0.4): Omits explicit flow positions ("after Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"); adds minor extras ("continue to NFC", "skip to Disburse Funds" – accurate but not in ground truth; "(for ≥ €15 000 loans)"; lowercase "*approve* or *reject*" vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**").
- **Documents** (-0.3): Bullets vs. numbered; lacks ground truth's "(complete list)" title phrasing and explanatory note "*(No credit bureau...)*" (though not required by prompt).

Very minor phrasing diffs (e.g., "≤ 2 points" vs. "≤ 2", "proceed to" vs. "send to") are present but do not alter meaning. Utmost strictness applied for non-identical match, but excellence in completeness and fidelity prevents lower score.
