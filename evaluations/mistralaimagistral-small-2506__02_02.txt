- **Q1:** Correct. "3 distinct cases": matches ground truth.
- **Q2:** Correct. Sequence for C002 is Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order, which matches exactly.
- **Q3:** The actual activities are "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock", in that (alphabetical) order. The LLM also lists these. However, the LLM incorrectly adds parenthetical case details ("case 'C002'" and "case 'C001' and 'C003'") after each activity. The prompt explicitly requests one per line and only the activity names, as shown in the ground truth.

**Deduction rationale:**  
- This extra explanation is a deviation from the required format (activity name only).  
- While the factual content is correct, the format and verbosity contradict the requested simplicity and should be considered a notable error for strict grading guidelines.

**Final:**  
Q1: 10/10  
Q2: 10/10  
Q3: 7/10 (for not matching required format and including extraneous info)

Averaging (with extra penalty due to strictness):  
Score: **9.0**
