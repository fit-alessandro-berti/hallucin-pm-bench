9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth (3 distinct cases). Full points.
- **Q2**: Exact match to ground truth sequence and formatting (including â†’ separators and activity names). Full points.
- **Q3**: Core content correct (distinct activities: Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock; alphabetically ordered as A before C; listed on separate lines). However, significant deductions for extraneous elements: added numbering (1., 2.), case attributions (e.g., "(case 'C002')"), bold formatting, and an unrequested note ("(No other direct predecessor...)"). These introduce unnecessary details not in the ground truth, violating the strict "list every distinct activity... one per line" instruction and resembling minor hallucinations of elaboration. Format diverges from ground truth's simple dash-prefixed lines. Deduct 1.0 point overall for these additions and formatting mismatch.

Overall score reflects near-perfect factual accuracy (high utility) but strict penalty for extras and format deviations per guidelines.
