**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high base score)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), as differentiated by table metrics (e.g., highest wait/rework for Request, highest SLA/stdev for Review, notable upstream wait/SLA for Initial). Explanations strictly cite table data (e.g., 150 min wait, 22.0% rework, 12.4% SLA, 9 min stdev, 18 min wait). Actions are concrete and data-driven (rework/wait → validation; SLA/stdev → staffing/AI; wait → resources). Memo format concise (<200 words), no hallucinations, no absent activities mentioned. Overall throughput drop noted accurately (~35% vs. table's 280→179).
- **Penalties (-1.8 total for differences/small errors)**:
  - **Incomplete explanations (-0.8)**: Misses key table metrics vs. ground truth—e.g., Review_Documents' longest proc (25 min) & wait (30 min) uncited (focuses only SLA/stdev); Initial_Assessment's proc (12 min) & SLA (3.2%) omitted (only wait/stdev). Ground truth cites fuller set (wait/proc/rework/SLA), making its "why" more precise.
  - **Action flaws (-0.5)**: Review_Documents action lists *two* options ("senior adjusters ... or AI-OCR") vs. task's "one concrete" (ground truth has one). Others solid but less measurable (no "halve rework" or "cut X% time" quantifiers).
  - **Minor extras/inferences (-0.3)**: Interpretive phrases ("capacity mismatch", "processing friction", "cyclical back-and-forth") slightly beyond strict table; 35% capacity loss approximate/unprojected vs. ground truth's data-tied "~10% lift, >40% SLA reduction". Header more verbose.
  - **Style/minor (-0.2)**: Bullet "*Action:*" vs. ground truth's inline "*Recommendation:*"; activity names spaced (fine, but table uses underscores).

Very close match (same core content), but strict rubric demands metric fidelity & exactness—partial omissions drop from 10.0.
