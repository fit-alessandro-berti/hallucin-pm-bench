3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) exactly as specified, with no synonyms or disallowed phrasings leaking in, and presents them in a Markdown table structure. This earns partial credit for adhering to the vocabulary policy and basic output format. However, under utmost strictness, the following errors result in severe point deductions:

- **Added/Renamed Activities (Major Violation)**: The prompt instructs to cover *every activity* described in the narrative without renaming, merging, or *adding* activities. The LLM adds three extraneous activities ("Payment Approval", "Fund Release", "Notification") not directly matching the ground truth's interpretation (which derives "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" from the narrative's escalation and release steps without addition). "Notification" is not a distinct activity in the ground truth and appears invented, violating "do not add." This alone warrants a ~4-point deduction for fabricating content.

- **Inaccurate RACI Assignments (Multiple Critical Errors)**: Assignments diverge significantly from the ground truth across *all* activities, ignoring conditional escalation logic (e.g., Compliance Officer involvement only for high-risk cases) and role nuances:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM assigns R to Front-Office Analyst and I to all others; ground truth has R,A for Front-Office, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury Ops, and – for Compliance Officer. Incorrect (overuses I; misses A, C, and –).
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: LLM assigns only R to Compliance Analyst and I to all others; ground truth has R,A for Compliance Analyst, C for Compliance Officer, I for Treasury Ops, and – for Front-Office. Misses A, C, and –; incorrectly informs uninvolved roles.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM assigns only R to Compliance Analyst and I to all others; ground truth has R for Compliance Analyst, A for Compliance Officer, C for Front-Office, and I for Treasury Ops. Misses A and C; wrong on Front-Office (I vs. C).
  - Added activities' assignments are approximations at best (e.g., "Payment Approval" has A for Compliance Officer but misses R,A and C for Compliance Analyst; "Fund Release" misses A for Treasury Ops, C for Compliance Analyst/Officer). Overreliance on I for non-involved roles is a systemic error, as RACI should use – for no involvement, not default to Informed. This inaccuracy across the board deducts ~4 points.

- **Formatting and Precision Errors (Compounding Issues)**: 
  - No bolding on multi-role assignments (e.g., **R, A** in ground truth vs. plain single letters in LLM).
  - Uses single letters without commas for multiples (none occur, but style mismatch).
  - No use of – for no involvement; instead, incorrectly fills with I, bloating the matrix.
  - Activity names for added items are not bolded consistently, and table alignment/headers are close but not identical (e.g., ground truth has fuller dashes in separator row).
  These small but pervasive errors deduct ~1 point per category, as strictness demands exact replication.

Overall, while the core vocabulary and table intent are intact (~30% alignment), the matrix fails to accurately reflect the process narrative's roles/activities, resulting in a fundamentally unreliable output. A score above 3.0 would understate the cumulative differences.
