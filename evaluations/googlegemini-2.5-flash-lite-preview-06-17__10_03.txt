4.0

The answer demonstrates some effort to use the authorized vocabulary, but it contains significant errors that result in a major deviation from the ground truth, each affecting the score as follows:

**Positives:**
- The table uses only the four authorized vocabulary terms and does not leak synonyms (“Preliminary Assessment”, “CDD”, etc.)—this is correct.
- All four role headers are present and in the correct order.

**Major errors:**
1. **Activity names:**  
   - The LLM answer introduces “Payment Approval”, “Fund Release”, and “Notification” as activities, but the ground truth specifies only “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”. “Notification” is not present in the ground truth, nor is “Payment Approval” as a separate activity. This is a deviation from instructions not to add or rename activities.
   - The ground truth merges Responsible and Accountable as “R, A” when appropriate; the LLM splits these and never marks dual assignments.
   - “Compliance Officer Approval” is renamed to “Payment Approval”, violating the prohibition on renaming activities.
   - “Release Funds” is renamed as “Fund Release” (minor error, but still an unauthorized renaming).
   
2. **RACI assignments:**  
   - The assignments don't match the ground truth: 
     - “Intake Vetting”: LLM answer gives only R to Front-Office Analyst (should be R, A), and marks I everywhere else, instead of C and I as per ground truth.
     - “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”: LLM gives only R to Compliance Analyst, rather than R, A as in ground truth; misses C (Compliance Officer) and assigns I where “–” or C are appropriate.
     - “Risk Scoring”: Accountable party is not correctly given; ground truth gives A to Compliance Officer, but LLM doesn’t.
     - “Compliance Officer Approval” is missing entirely.
     - “Release Funds”/“Fund Release” is missing Accountable assignment.
   - “Notification” is not in ground truth and thus its assignments are irrelevant or incorrect.

3. **Marking scheme (C/I/–):**
   - The dash (–) marker is required, but the LLM uses I or omits the entry, again deviating from ground truth and instructions.

**Minor errors:**  
- No bolding of authorized activity names.
- Incorrect assignment of R/A for several activities.

Considering all above, especially the introduction of unauthorized activities, many misassigned RACI roles, and improper activity naming, the score receives a major penalty, resulting in 4.0. There was **no outright use of forbidden vocabulary**, and the mandated terms did appear, preventing total failure, but the errors are significant enough to warrant a low grade.
