**6.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correctness (high marks, but not perfect)**: Final conclusion ("Yes") matches ground truth. Provides valid minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T5) proving T5 fires before T3, with correct brief justification (p3=1, p4=0 post-T2). No factual errors in the end result.
- **Major deductions**:
  - **Structural flaws & flip-flopping (-2.0)**: Starts with incorrect "No — it’s impossible" and a rambling, contradictory "proof" that self-undermines (e.g., initially claims blocker, then admits "at first glance T5 *could* fire", then corrects). This is confusing, unprofessional, and violates "brief" justification requirement; reads like uncorrected chain-of-thought.
  - **Lack of precision & completeness (-1.0)**: No markings after steps (ground truth has explicit `p1=1, p2=1` etc.). Sequence stops at T5 (minimal but incomplete vs. ground truth's full T1-T5 showing post-T3 disablement). Misses insightful "must fire before T3 if ever" (true per inhibitor logic, implied but not stated).
  - **Minor issues (-0.5)**: Overly verbose initial false proof dilutes brevity. No explicit inhibitor enabling notation (e.g., `p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0`).
- **Why not lower?** Arrives at exact required elements (yes + sequence + brief justify). Why not higher? Strictness demands clean, direct match—no tolerance for initial error or mess despite correction. Ground truth is flawless exemplar.
