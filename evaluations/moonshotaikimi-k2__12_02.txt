The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a valid counterexample from case C003 with accurate line citations (6 and 7), directly addressing the sequence reversal and contradicting the "always follows" claim in a concise paragraph. However, it incurs significant point loss for incompleteness: it omits the additional counterexample in case C005 (lines 11-12), where *Validate_Payment* occurs without any preceding *Receive_Order*, which the ground truth explicitly highlights as proof that the activity does not always follow. This misses a key aspect of thorough verification against the full log, reflecting a partial but not exhaustive justification under strict evaluation criteria.
