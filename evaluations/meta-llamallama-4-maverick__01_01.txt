### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortfall, ~30% Match)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points (eligibility validation in step 2, amount threshold after step 3, and final approval in steps 3/4). The LLM answer only captures one (the amount threshold, described as "implicit"), missing the eligibility check (which logically branches to reject/continue) and the approval/rejection at pre-approval/auditor review (explicit in constraints as "succeeded"). This omission of two critical branches violates the prompt's requirement to "summarise every decision point," resulting in a severe deduction. Even minor phrasing like "implicitly decides" deviates from the ground truth's precise "branching logic."
  
- **Required Documents (Full Match, 100%)**: The list is identical to the ground truth, including all seven documents and the conditional note for *AuditTrail*. No extras introduced, aligning perfectly with the "do not introduce" constraint.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: The LLM adds an unnecessary explanatory sentence ("These documents are used throughout..."), which is not in the ground truth and slightly dilutes focus, but the core lists are concise. However, the incomplete decisions section dominates as a core prompt element, preventing a higher score under strict criteria. No hallucinations or legacy activities mentioned, but incompleteness equates to significant error.
