### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% of score deduction)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 precise decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate with score difference details; Amount Threshold Decision with exact conditions and flow; Final Micro-loan Board Approval with vote outcomes). The LLM incorrectly expands to 5 points, introducing non-decision steps as "decisions" (e.g., Quick KYC Verification is a verification step, not a decision point; Neighbourhood Feedback Check is a procedural check without binary "fail" branching in the process flow). Descriptions lack the ground truth's specificity (e.g., no mention of "branch after Dual Underwriter Split" or exact escalation phrasing). This deviates significantly from the prompt's focus on true decision branches, warranting heavy penalties for inaccuracy and over-invention.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors, ~20% of score deduction)**: The list is mostly complete and uses exact terminology, but small inaccuracies include: "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"; "Latest Income Statement" omits the specified "(pay-stub/tax slip)" detail from the prompt/ground truth; "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds "template" which matches the prompt but ground truth simplifies to "(CIS)". The LLM omits the ground truth's explanatory note on exclusions, but this is secondary. These are nitpicks but, per instructions, reflect significant point loss even for minor wording variances.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor Strengths, ~20% retained)**: The LLM uses exact activity names without introducing standard terminology (good adherence). Formatting is clear but less structured than ground truth (e.g., no numbering consistency or contextual "after [step]" notes). Strict evaluation prioritizes exact match to ground truth, so the core content mismatches dominate, preventing a higher score.
