6.0

The LLM answer shows moderate accuracy but introduces errors and non-strict adherence to the exact flow/terms required by the prompt:

**Positives:**
- The list of required documents is complete and matching the ground truth, except for not specifying "pay-stub/tax slip" on the income statement (small deduction).
- Steps use terminology from the process ("Final Micro-loan Board Approval", "Underwriter Alignment Gate", etc.).

**Errors and Loss of Points:**
1. **Incorrect and Extraneous Decision Points:**
   - Lists "Quick KYC Verification" and "Neighbourhood Feedback Check" as decision points. In the micro-loan process, these are activities, not true decision points as defined by the prompt and shown in the ground truth.
   - The only legitimate decision points are: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval.
   - Including these extra checkpoints demonstrates misunderstanding of the process and the prompt's requirement for strict process mapping (major deduction).

2. **Branching Logic Placement/Description:**
   - Implies that "Final Micro-loan Board Approval" is always a step, not only when amount ≥ €15 000, though this is mostly implied by the previous point. Strictly, there could be some ambiguity.

3. **Document List Minor Issue:**
   - "Latest Income Statement" does not specify "(pay-stub/tax slip)", a small loss of points for omitting the required detail but the meaning is clear.

4. **Omissions:**
   - Fails to clarify in the required documents list that no other standard documents are needed, as ground truth does (minor, but requested by prompt for completeness).

**Summary**:
Despite using process language, the LLM misidentifies what counts as a "decision point" in this process, which constitutes a significant loss of fidelity. Document list is very close, but small missing detail. Under strict grading, these errors warrant a substantial deduction.

**Final score: 6.0**
