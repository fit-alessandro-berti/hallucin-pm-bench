**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Exact match ("1" vs. "1"). Perfect: +5.0.
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Core idea captured (tiny non-representative sample leads to bias in frequency estimates, e.g., 1-in-3 cases). Under 120 words (92). +3.2 total.
  - Strengths (+1.6): Notes 3 cases, 33% illusion, sample bias, unknown full log → risks over/underestimation.
  - Deductions (-0.8 total, strict for omissions/diffs):
    - Misses precise scale (14 events, <2 hours, 3 cases only) → -0.3.
    - No statistical depth (wide CI, rare-event sampling error, 0%-swing volatility) → -0.3.
    - Ignores string-matching pitfalls/near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") → -0.2.
    - Minor: Focuses "monthly volume" vs. pure frequency/proportion → -0.1 (slight imprecision).
- Overall: Strong alignment on bias/non-representativeness but omits key ground-truth nuances (stats, variants, quantification) → significant strict penalty, not 10.
