The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in conclusion, structure (one concise explanatory sentence starting with the key impossibility statement), and core reasoning (lack of per-instance duration data from start/complete events, given only counts). Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly mentioning "timestamps" (directly referenced in prompt as "no timestamps were released"), using "duration between start and complete events" instead; (2) "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute" (slightly less emphatic); (3) "total number of occurrences" vs. "event counts" and "required start-to-completion intervals are absent" (paraphrase loses exact phrasing on intervals' absence). These are small wording variances but warrant strict point loss per instructions.
