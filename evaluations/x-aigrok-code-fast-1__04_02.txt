5.2

**Justification:**  
- **Format:** Correctly lists all rules, statuses, and short justifications. However, the response is cluttered with large amounts of irrelevant padding/filler text, exceeding expected brevity and format, which is a significant issue given the instructions.
- **R1:** Correctly marked as Compliant, justification accurate.
- **R2:** *Incorrectly marked as Compliant* (should be Violated): The rule requires Ship_Goods within 2 days of the latest approval (after Change_Request), but Ship_Goods happens *before* the new Manager_Approval, so this is a compliance violation. The LLM only measured from the initial approvals, not the restarted sequence after the Change_Request, which is a *major factual error*.
- **R3:** Correctly marked Violated, clear justification.
- **R4:** Correctly marked Not Applicable, justification is fine.
- **R5:** Correctly marked Violated, with appropriate explanation.
- **R6:** Correctly marked Compliant.
- **Summary and Result:** The final conclusion of NON-COMPLIANT is correct.
- **Conciseness:** Lacks conciseness due to overwhelming padding (direct violation of explicit formatting instructions; this is a substantial deduction).
- **Errors:** The misclassification of R2 from “Violated” (in ground truth) to “Compliant” is a critical compliance misjudgment.

**Points lost FOR:**
- Misjudging R2 (major error: -2.5)
- Excess unnecessary text/padding (moderate error: -1.3)
- Some justifications are less precise than the ground truth (minor error: -1.0)

**Points retained FOR:**
- Correct assessment and justification for most other rules
- Proper identification of R3 and R5 violations and correct overall result

**Conclusion:**  
This answer matches the ground truth in most rule assessments, with a *serious rule misjudgment* (R2) and egregious format/padding blunders. These errors warrant a substantial penalty, but the answer is still functional (not failing overall). **Score: 5.2/10.0**
