2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **R1**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, justification aligned within word limit). +1 point.
- **R2**: Major error—incorrectly Compliant (should be Violated); justification ignores impact of Change_Request requiring new approval on 07-Mar, miscalculating "last required approval" timing. -4 points (factual violation of rules interplay).
- **R3**: Matches ground truth (Violated, justification aligned). +1 point.
- **R4**: Matches ground truth (Not Applicable, justification aligned). +1 point.
- **R5**: Partially matches (Violated, but justification incomplete—omits Pay_Invoice before new approval, focuses narrowly on Ship_Goods). -1 point (minor but strict deduction for imprecision).
- **R6**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, justification aligned). +1 point.
- **Overall Result**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). +1 point.
- **Format & Extraneous Content**: Severe violation—required strict format (rules + justifications ≤20 words each + all-caps conclusion) is buried in excessive padding, filler, internal notes, and irrelevant text (>500 words of noise, including "Glueballs and quirks observed" nonsense). This alone warrants -5 points for non-adherence, unprofessionalism, and deviation from ≤20-word limit per rule.
- **Total**: Base 7.0 for partial rule correctness, minus 6.0 for R2 error + format disaster = 2.0. Strict grading applied; even minor format issues would deduct, but this is egregious.
