**9.5**

**Justification:**

- **Question 1:** Correctly identifies “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs **1** time. **(Full points)**
- **Question 2a:** Correctly computes **2.08%** (events). **(Full points)**
- **Question 2b:** Correctly computes **8.33%** (cases). **(Full points)**
- **Question 3:** The explanation is accurate: it notes the activity appears only once, warns of unreliable metrics due to a single instance, addresses unreliability for performance/prediction, cautions against generalization, and mentions issues with variability. This covers the required elements.
    - **Very minor deduction:** The answer could be slightly more precise in drawing the link between statistical variance and unreliability (as in "confidence intervals remain wide"). Still, it does make the main points well.

**Summary:** Only the subtlest wording nuance distinguishes it from an ideal answer. Small deduction for not specifically referencing "confidence intervals," but all major criteria met.
