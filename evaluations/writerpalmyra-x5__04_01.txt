**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correct overall verdict (Non-compliant)**: +2.0 points (matches ground truth).
- **Correctly identifies Rule 2 violation**: +1.5 points (cites events 4,8,9 accurately; core issue spotted).
- **Correctly notes Rule 1 satisfied**: +0.8 points (cites events 2,3,5; order and roles match).
- **Major deductions**:
  - **Misses Rule 3 violation entirely** (-2.5): Ground truth flags `Goods_Received` (6), next two events (7,8) lack `Three_way_match` (at 10, distance=3>2). LLM ignores Rule 3 completely—no check, no citation.
  - **No evaluation of Rules 4 or 5** (-1.0): Ground truth systematically checks both (satisfied); LLM omits, making justification incomplete/non-comprehensive.
- **Format/structure violations** (-0.8): Prompt requires clean “Compliant/Non-compliant” + *numbered justification citing relevant rules*. LLM is rambling (starts "Compliant", self-corrects multiple times, redundant "Final answer", thinking-aloud notes); not structured or concise like ground truth.
- **Minor errors** (-0.3 each, significant per instructions): Unnecessary notes (e.g., "timestamp-ordered"); confusing phrasing ("appears to violate... but... violates"); no full rule-by-rule numbering.

Total reflects partial accuracy but critical omissions and sloppiness; not equivalent to ground truth's exhaustive, clean analysis.
