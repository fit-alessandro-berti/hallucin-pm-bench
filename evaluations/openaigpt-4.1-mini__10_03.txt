4.0

The answer demonstrates effort to use the mandated terms, but it diverges from the ground truth in several serious ways, with multiple strictness-level issues:

**Vocabulary policy:**
- All four mandated terms (“Intake Vetting,” “KYC Review,” “AML Screening,” “Risk Scoring”) are used, with no forbidden synonyms. (No deduction.)

**Activity list:**
- The LLM answer invents/renames activities (“Approval (for high risk),” “Schedule payment,” “Notification”), which are not allowed. The ground truth uses only the authorized list, with “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds” as explicit activities. “Notification,” “Schedule payment” are not authorized. (-2 pts)
- “Schedule payment” is not a required discrete activity in the narrative/ground truth; “Notification” is not specified as an activity in the ground truth and represents a deviation. (-1 pt)

**Role involvement and RACI assignments:**
- “Intake Vetting”: In the LLM answer, only the Front-Office Analyst is “R”; ground truth is “R, A” for Analyst, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury Ops, none for Officer. (Misses A for Analyst, omits C/I for other roles.) (-0.5 pt)
- “KYC Review”: LLM answer gives “R” to Compliance Analyst only; ground truth is “R, A” Compliance Analyst, C Compliance Officer, I Treasury Ops. (Misses A and other roles.) (-0.5 pt)
- “AML Screening”: Same as above; “R” only, ground truth “R, A” and more. (-0.5 pt)
- “Risk Scoring”: LLM gives “R” only to Compliance Analyst; ground truth: Compliance Analyst is R, Compliance Officer is A, Analyst is C, Treasury Ops is I. (Roles/assignments incomplete.) (-0.5 pt)
- “Compliance Officer Approval”: Activity is omitted from LLM answer; instead, LLM splits “Approval (for high risk)” with only “A” for Officer (should be R, A), and omits Informed/Consulted for other roles. (-1 pt)
- “Release Funds”: LLM gives “R” to Treasury Ops only; ground truth Treasury Ops is “R, A”, Compliance Analyst and Officer are C, FO Analyst is I. (Misses A and C/I for other roles.) (-0.5 pt)

**Formatting/structure:**
- Markdown table is returned as required.
- Legend is correct.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer does not leak prohibited synonyms (the one critical mandate it survives). However, roles are systematically under-assigned, required RACI designations are missing for most roles/activities, “R, A” structure is missing throughout, inexact/unauthorized activity names are used, and the table does not duplicate the ground truth’s assignments. The answer grossly underspecifies the matrix, omits Informed/Consulted roles, and adds/omits activities.

Thus, per “utmost strictness,” these issues result in a score of 4.0.
