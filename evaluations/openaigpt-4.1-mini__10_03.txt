2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, without synonyms or leaks from the narrative. However, it fails significantly in other areas, leading to a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Activity Coverage and Naming (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** from the narrative without renaming, merging, or adding. The narrative describes: Preliminary Assessment (maps to Intake Vetting), CDD (KYC Review), Sanctions Check (AML Screening), risk rating (Risk Scoring), escalation/approval by Compliance Officer, scheduling payment by Treasury Ops (for low-risk), and releasing funds with notification. The ground truth consolidates logically into 6 activities with precise names like "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". The LLM answer incorrectly adds/renames activities (e.g., "Approval (for high risk)" instead of "Compliance Officer Approval"; invents "Schedule payment" and "Notification" as separate rows, merging the latter into release process). This adds 2 extraneous activities, merges/omits low-risk scheduling into release, and fails to cover the full process flow, resulting in incomplete and inaccurate representation.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.5 points)**: Assignments diverge substantially from the ground truth, which interprets the narrative with appropriate Responsible/Accountable (R/A) for primary performers, Consulted (C) for reviews/escalations, and Informed (I) for notifications/updates. Examples:
  - Intake Vetting: LLM assigns only R to Front-Office Analyst (missing A, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury Ops).
  - KYC Review/AML Screening: LLM assigns only R to Compliance Analyst (missing A, C for Compliance Officer, I for Treasury Ops).
  - Risk Scoring: LLM assigns only R to Compliance Analyst (missing C for Front-Office Analyst, A for Compliance Officer, I for Treasury Ops).
  - No accurate row for "Compliance Officer Approval" (LLM's version only has A for Officer, missing R/A for Officer, C for Analyst, I for Front-Office).
  - "Release Funds": LLM assigns R to Treasury Ops (missing A, C for Analyst/Officer, I for Front-Office).
  This underrepresents consultations, accountabilities, and informings, making the matrix incomplete and misleading.

- **Format and Presentation (Minor but Strict Deduction: -1.0 point)**: The Markdown table is basic but uses empty cells instead of dashes (â€“) for no involvement, as in ground truth. No bolding for activities or R/A cells, which ground truth uses for clarity. The added "Legend" is unnecessary (prompt specifies only the table) and deviates from ground truth's clean format without explanation.

Overall, while the core vocabulary is correct (partial credit), the matrix is structurally flawed, with ~70% mismatch in activities/assignments, violating the "utmost strictness" for even small errors like naming and omissions. A score above 3.0 would reward incomplete adherence.
