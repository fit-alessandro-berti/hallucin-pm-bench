The model output is:

```json
{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Pack_Items",
  "Q3": "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00",
  "Q4": 2,
  "Q5": ["Quality_Check"]
}
```

Assessment by question (strict):

- Q1: Correct (3) — matches ground truth.
- Q2: Correct ("Pack_Items") — matches ground truth.
- Q3: Correct (timestamp) — matches ground truth.
- Q4: Correct (2) — matches ground truth.
- Q5: **Incorrect** — The answer only lists ["Quality_Check"], but the correct answer is ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] (i.e., it misses two required values and erroneously lists "Quality_Check", which *is* a first event in case C-77).

Q5 is a multi-component list: out of 3 expected elements, the model missed 2 entirely and included 1 incorrect element. This is a significant logical error. Each error must sharply impact the score, especially on a multi-valued question.

All other questions are answered perfectly, but this major miss on Q5 means the submission is not mostly correct.

Hence, on a strict grading scale:
- Full points for Q1–Q4.
- Major deduction (at least 5–6 points) for faulty Q5.

Final score: **4.0**
