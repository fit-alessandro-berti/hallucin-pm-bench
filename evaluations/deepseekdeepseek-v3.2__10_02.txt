**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in nearly every aspect, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Structure and formatting**: LLM adds a title, top-placed Key (vs. ground truth's bottom Legend), bolded **R/A** combinations (vs. separate **R**, **A**, etc.), numbered rows with verbose activity names (vs. unnumbered, concise "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" headers), and 7 rows (vs. 6). Includes a 7th row combining archive/notify not matching ground truth's "Archive Record".
- **Columns/roles**: Omits "Operations Manager" column entirely (critical mismatch; ground truth has 4 roles, LLM has 3).
- **Activity mappings**: Names differ entirely (e.g., LLM "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. ground "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM adds "Send SWIFT message" row absent in ground truth; no exact matches). Misses ground truth's bolding and phrasing precision.
- **RACI assignments**: Zero rows match exactly; every cell differs (e.g., "Receive": LLM Analyst **R/A** others – vs. ground Analyst **R**, Liaison I, Ops **A**, IT C; "KYC Review": LLM Liaison **R/A** others – vs. ground Analyst C, Liaison **R**, Ops **A**, IT I; "Approve": LLM Analyst I + Liaison **R/A** vs. ground Analyst C + Liaison **R** + Ops **A** + IT I). LLM invents Analyst "I" for approve (unsupported).
- **Coverage**: LLM splits source steps into 7 (over-expands), while ground truth consolidates precisely into 6 without omissions/substitutions as per its own notes.
- **Vocabulary/mandate adherence**: Matches on mandated terms (KYC Review, etc.), but this single positive is outweighed by all other failures.

No partial credit for Markdown or vocab, as differences are pervasive and structural/content mismatches are not "small errors."
