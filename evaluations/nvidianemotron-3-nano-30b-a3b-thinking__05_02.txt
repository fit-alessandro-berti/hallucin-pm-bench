**1.0**

The LLM answer fails completely: malformed diff (invalid hunk header, redundant unchanged lines), incorrect modification (wrong task `Task_GrantAccess` dueDate to `P3D`, worsening SLA instead of fixing the P5D bottleneck), and invalid rationale (misidentifies dependencies and ignores 3-day SLA). No alignment with ground truth.
