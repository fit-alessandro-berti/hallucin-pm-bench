8.0

The LLM answer correctly lists both relevant pairs, in correct alphabetical order and with correct pairing. However, it omits aligning the spacing within the line to match “Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines” as seen in the ground truth. While this seems like a minor formatting difference, your instructions call for the utmost strictness, and small errors should lead to significant loss of points. Thus, the difference in whitespace alignment—especially since the output format was specified—warrants a deduction; the answer is otherwise factually and procedurally correct.

Score rationale:
- All correct pairs: +7 points
- Correct order: +1
- Minor formatting deviation (not matching exact whitespace): −2

Final: 8.0
