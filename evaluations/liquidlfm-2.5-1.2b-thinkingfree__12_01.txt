**6.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a valid counterexample from Case 1001 with accurate timestamps, disproving the claim (one counterexample suffices for "always"). However, under utmost strictness, it incurs major point loss for incompleteness: omits Case 1002 (no `Update_Inventory`, directly disproving "always") and Case 1003 (another reversal, lines 11 & 14). Lacks bullet-point structure, line citations, and explicit "always" analysis; includes odd phrasing ("Impossible") and extraneous hedging. These differences from the comprehensive, structured ground truth significantly reduce the score despite factual core accuracy on the cited case.
