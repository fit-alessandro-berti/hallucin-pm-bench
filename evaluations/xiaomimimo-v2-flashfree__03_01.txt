**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth (GT) in structure, flow logic, naming, BPMN elements, and adherence to the prompt's "exactly as stated" rule, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Key differences:

#### **Critical Flow Errors (Major Deductions: -5.0 points)**
- **Password reset path hallucinated**: LLM routes `t2` (Provide Reset Instructions) → `t5` (Resolve Issue) → `t6` (Confirm). GT correctly routes `t2` → `t6` directly (`f5`), skipping "Resolve Issue" (as description line 3 states it "goes straight to Provide Reset Instructions"; no mention of routing to "Resolve Issue"). This invents an unmentioned path/merger at `t5`, violating "Do not invent or add".
- Merges password path into "Resolve Issue" task semantically incorrectly ("Resolve Issue" is only for post-diagnosis/specialist per lines 5-6).

#### **Missing/Invalid BPMN Elements (Deductions: -1.5 points)**
- No `<conditionExpression>` on gateway outgoing flows (e.g., GT has `yes`/`no`/`Customer Confirms?` logic via `f3/f4/f7/f8/f12/f13`). LLM gateways lack conditions, making decisions implicit/unmodeled.
- `serviceTask` used throughout (e.g., `t1`, `t3`). GT uses `task` (except implicit service nature); unnecessary specificity.
- Missing `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` declaration.
- `isExecutable="true"` vs. GT `"false"`.

#### **Naming & ID Inconsistencies (Deductions: -1.0 points)**
- Names not exact/concise matches:
  | Element | LLM | GT | Issue |
  |---------|-----|----|-------|
  | Start | "Customer submits support ticket" | "Ticket Submitted" | Verbose, not concise. |
  | Classify | "Classify Ticket" | "Auto-Classification" | Not "automatically classified". |
  | gw1 | "Is Password Reset?" | "Password Reset?" | Extra words. |
  | gw2 | "Resolve Issue or Forward?" | "Resolved Internally?" | Invented phrasing. |
  | gw3 | "Issue Persist?" | "Customer Confirms?" | Inverted/mismatched line 8-9. |
  | Forward | `t4` | `t5` | ID swap, but minor. |
- Process: `id="AcmeTechSupportTicket"` vs. GT `id="support_ticket" name="Support-Ticket"`.

#### **Structural/Syntactic Issues (Deductions: -0.5 points)**
- Extra `xmlns:bpmn` (redundant), `targetNamespace="http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn"` vs. GT `"http://acmetech/support"`.
- Inline `<sequenceFlow id="flow13"/>` + comments bloat XML (unnecessary; GT is clean list).
- 3 gateways modeled (correct logically), but prompt specifies "two decision points" (minor, but GT has 3).

The model captures the loop (`gw3` → `t3` Initial Diagnosis) and no extra activities/timers (avoids common traps), but core password flow invention + omissions make it non-equivalent. Equivalent to ~20% match; strict scaling yields 2.0.
