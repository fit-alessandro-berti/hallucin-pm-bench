10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly. Questions 2a and 2b match the calculations and rounding precisely. For Question 3, the response is under 100 words (85), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue, highlights variance/instability (e.g., outliers, noise, inflated variance, over-fitting), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., unreliable forecasts for the full population), aligning with ground truth criteria without invention or deviation from the log. Minor formatting differences (e.g., table vs. plain text) do not impact correctness.
