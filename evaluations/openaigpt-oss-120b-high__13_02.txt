The LLM answer exactly matches the correct responses for all numeric items:

1. It correctly reports 1 occurrence of **Manual_Fraud_Check**.
2a. Calculates 2.08% of all events (1/48).
2b. Calculates 8.33% of unique cases (1/12).

For the explanation (3), the response:

- Clearly notes the single-occurrence problem.
- Discusses high variance, risk of bias, overfitting, and unreliability if generalized.
- Warns against generalising from so little evidence and highlights instability.

The answer fully aligns with all ground truth requirements, both quantitative and qualitative, with no deviation or omission. No invented information occurs. The answer is also concise and follows the instructions precisely.
