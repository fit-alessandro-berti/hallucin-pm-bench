The LLM answer is correct (No, with accurate counterexamples C002 and C004, matching the log sequences precisely). It fulfills the task requirements: Yes/No answer and justification citing relevant CaseIDs/sequences. No factual errors or hallucinations.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for:
- Lack of exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all 4 cases (omits compliant C001/C003, unlike ground truth's table).
- Simpler bullet format vs. ground truth's structured table with ✅/❌ and notes (less meticulous presentation, though not required).
- No explicit quantification ("two out of four") or rephrasing of the "always" claim in conclusion.

Strict but not overly punitive, as core logic/content aligns ~95%.
