The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and adherence to the prompt's required format (headings, task/gateway phrasing, no extras). All added/removed tasks and gateway changes match exactly. The only difference is minor whitespace/formatting in the second gateway line (extra spaces after the colon in ground truth for apparent alignment, absent in LLM answer), which violates strict textual equivalence but does not alter meaning or violate instructions.
