**Score: 9.0**

**Justification:**  

The LLM answer is accurate:  
- It correctly answers **No**.
- It explicitly identifies both Case C002 and C004 as counterexamples, with correct sequences.
- The explanation clearly states the rule is invalidated, and cites exactly which activities break the "immediate after" claim.

**Points lost:**  
- The answer does not address Cases C001 and C003 at all (where the rule *is* followed), nor does it state the proportion of violations ("two out of four"), which the ground truth highlights.
- It lacks a systematic, case-by-case format/table as in the ground truth.

**Overall:**  
- The essential reasoning and evidence are present and correct, with no content errors regarding the log.
- The omission of full context and thoroughness results in a significant but not major deduction.
