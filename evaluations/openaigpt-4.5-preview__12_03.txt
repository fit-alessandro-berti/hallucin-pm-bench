The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides accurate justification by citing the two violating cases (C002 and C004) with precise sequences, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns with the core facts in the ground truth. However, it loses a full point for lacking the exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all cases (e.g., omitting confirmation of compliant cases C001 and C003), which the ground truth includes for completeness, and for not using a structured table formatâ€”small differences under strict evaluation criteria. No factual errors.
