9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Content Match (Perfect, +10/10)**: Identifies exactly the two correct concurrent sets with identical tasks (`Quality_Check` & `Update_Inventory`; `Generate_Replenishment_Report` & `Notify_Procurement`), in correct sequential order. No mention of A/C. Matches the "same parallel construct" criterion precisely.
- **Structure & Numbering (Very Good, -0.3)**: Uses "Set 1"/"Set 2" (clear numbering as requested), but not plain numeric "1./2." like ground truth. Adds descriptive parentheticals ("Parallel Split #1 → Merge #1") which are accurate but not in ground truth (minor embellishment).
- **Formatting (Good, -0.3)**: Bullet lists vs. ground truth's inline `code` with ‖ symbol; bolding and dashes are clean but diverge stylistically. Extra title/header is unnecessary but harmless.
- **Conciseness & Extra Info (Minor Penalty, -0.2)**: Includes accurate summary explaining gateways/sequence (aligns with process logic and implies "no others"), but longer than ground truth's single closing sentence ("No other..."). Prompt requests only "list," so unsolicited detail is a small excess.

**Total: 9.2/10**. Strict deduction for non-identical phrasing/formatting/extras despite flawless accuracy/compliance.
