7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, numbers)**: Perfect match. The three worst activities by average waiting time are correctly identified and ranked (#1 Request_Documents at 36.5h avg/120.0h p95; #2 Send_Closure_Letter at 12.2h/44.0h; #3 Assess_Liability at 7.8h/16.4h). Numbers are quoted verbatim from the table, with only minor formatting variance (e.g., "120.0h" vs. "120 h"; "h" units consistent but not always abbreviated identically). No points lost here.
  
- **No unwarranted content**: Fully compliant. No mention of service times, throughput, other activities, or extraneous metrics. Stays focused on waiting times only.

- **Structure and constraints**: The response is a crisp memo under 150 words (~120 words). It includes a professional header (To/From/Subject), which aligns with "executive memo" expectations, though the ground truth omits this for a more abbreviated list format—minor deduction for not matching the ground truth's sparse style exactly.

- **Actions**: Relevant and concrete, each tied logically to reducing waiting times (e.g., automation/reminders for queues/delays) and explicitly promising ≥20% cuts (e.g., "cut average waits by at least 20%"; "designed to reduce waiting-time by ≥20%"). However, significant differences from ground truth: actions are rephrased entirely (e.g., LLM's "multi-channel reminders/escalation" vs. ground truth's "automated customer reminders with 24h escalation triggers + pilot tests"; no matching "pilot tests," "e-signature," or "rules-engine" specifics). Ground truth includes pseudo-data-driven elements like "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%," which LLM lacks, making actions feel less "data-driven." This is a notable deviation under strict criteria, warranting a deduction.

Overall, strong adherence to prompt core (9/10 on substance), but literal differences in action wording/content and format reduce it to 7.5. Small variances (e.g., units, phrasing like "95th percentile" vs. "p95") compound to prevent a higher score.
