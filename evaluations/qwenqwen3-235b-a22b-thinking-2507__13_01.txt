**Evaluation:**

**Q1. ("Exactly how many times does the activity 'Manual_Fraud_Check' occur?")**  
LLM: 1  
Ground truth: 1  
**No error.**

**Q2. ("What percentage of all logged events does this represent?")**  
LLM: 5.88%  
Ground truth: 5.56% ($1 ÷ 18 × 100$).  
**Error:** The LLM incorrectly subtracted the header from the event total, yielding 17 instead of 18. This is a simple but significant arithmetic mismatch and shows inattention to the provided data structure. **Strict grading per instructions: major point loss.**

**Q3. ("List the case identifier(s)...")**  
LLM: A1002  
Ground truth: Only case A1002  
**No error.**

**Q4. ("Two sampling-related reasons...")**  
LLM:  
- Insufficient temporal coverage (correct—equivalent to "temporal bias")  
- Critically small sample size (correct—matching "small sample size")  

Ground truth accepts these as valid and specifically asks only for two from its wider set.  
LLM references "high sampling error; e.g., ±49% margin of error at 95% confidence", which is an illustrative calculation based solely on the numerical data present, not an external assumption—so this does not count as hallucination, only as added precision.

**Overall:**  
- Q2 is *incorrect* as per arithmetic (header row included in total count). *This alone*, per the instruction to penalize small errors heavily, requires a substantial deduction.  
- Q1 and Q3 are perfectly correct.
- Q4 is valid and precise.

**Score: 5.5**  
The answer is correct on three out of four items, but has a significant quant error on percent and must be penalized strictly per instruction. It is well reasoned and does not hallucinate, but the arithmetic/log handling flaw is material; it represents a major error in process-analytic reading of the supplied data.
