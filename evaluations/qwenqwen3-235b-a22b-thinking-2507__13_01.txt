7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
This evaluation is strictly based on alignment with the ground truth, penalizing deviations harshly. The LLM answer is strong in structure, adherence to the log data (no hallucinations), and rationale provision, but suffers a critical error in Q2 due to miscounting events (17 vs. 18), leading to an incorrect percentage (5.88% vs. 5.56%). This is a factual misinterpretation of the "18 log lines" as excluding the header, directly contradicting the ground truth's calculation. Q1 and Q3 are exact matches. Q4 provides two valid reasons that align closely with ground truth options (small sample size and temporal bias), though phrasing is not identical and ties indirectly to the count error via "4 cases." Overall, the major Q2 discrepancy warrants a significant deduction from a potential perfect score, but partial accuracy in other areas prevents a lower grade.

- **Q1**: 10/10 (exact match: 1 occurrence).
- **Q2**: 0/10 (wrong total events and percentage; core calculation error).
- **Q3**: 10/10 (exact match: A1002).
- **Q4**: 8/10 (reasons match two ground truth options but with slight rephrasing and no explicit tie to event count variance).
