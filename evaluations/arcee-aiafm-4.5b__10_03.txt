1.0

The LLM answer fails catastrophically on multiple fronts, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key violations include: (1) Direct use of disallowed terms ("Customer Due Diligence (CDD)" and "Sanctions Check") in the table, breaching the vocabulary policy and leaking synonyms from the narrative; (2) Incorrect table structure (RACI columns instead of roles as columns, per ground truth format); (3) Invention of unauthorized activities ("Escalation Decision," "Treasury Ops Scheduling," "Approval Notification") and partial/inaccurate ones ("Funds Release"), violating "do not rename, merge, or add activities" while omitting or misaligning core ones like "KYC Review," "AML Screening," and "Compliance Officer Approval"; (4) Incomplete and inaccurate RACI assignments (e.g., blanks everywhere, no "R,A" notations, ignoring consultations/informations like ground truth's C/I for roles); (5) Explanatory note introduces further disallowed phrasing without using authorized terms exclusively. No alignment with ground truth beyond superficial use of two terms ("Intake Vetting," "Risk Scoring"), rendering the output non-compliant and useless.
