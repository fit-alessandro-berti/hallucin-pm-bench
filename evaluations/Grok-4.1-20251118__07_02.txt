8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes matching the ground truth: the three added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), the one removed task (Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway-type change (from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision, with appropriate XOR/OR terminology implied via tags). No incorrect additions, omissions, or misclassifications are present, aligning with the prompt's strict focus on these elements while ignoring cosmetics like renamings (e.g., task/gateway names, flow labels).

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Extra descriptive text** in bullets (e.g., "inserted after the start event," "new branch from the gateway," "replaces the simple reject path," "removed from the original 'no' path") deviates from the ground truth's concise, factual listing without positional or interpretive details. This adds unrequested context, violating the "summarise *all* changes" instruction by bloating the response (significant deduction: -1.0).
- **Inclusion of cosmetic names in gateway change** (old: "Eligible?"; new: "Eligibility Check") directly contradicts the prompt's "ignore cosmetic renamings," unlike the ground truth's pure type focus (e.g., "exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)"). This is a clear rule violation (significant deduction: -0.5).
- **Extra note at the end** ("Note: Additional changes...") is not in the ground truth or prompted, introducing unsolicited commentary (minor but deducts: -0.3).
- **Formatting mismatches**: Uses "###" subheadings and dashed bullets instead of the ground truth's "**bolded headings**" with numbered lists (1., 2., etc.) and asterisks. While not content errors, this fails "exactly these headings" precision under strict evaluation (minor deduction: -0.2).

Base score for core accuracy: 10.0. Total deductions: -2.0, yielding 8.0. The response is functionally strong but not a verbatim match, with extras reflecting sloppiness in adherence.
