The LLM's answer correctly responds "No" and precisely identifies both relevant counter-examples by referencing the correct case IDs and line numbers (case C003, lines 6–7, and case C005, lines 11–12), exactly as in the ground truth answer. The reasoning clearly justifies why the claim is false, with direct references to the evidence in the log and no irrelevant or missing details. No errors or omissions are present.
