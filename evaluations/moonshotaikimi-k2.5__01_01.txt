8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall—comprehensive, accurate to the process description, lists all 7 required documents without introducing extras, and identifies 3 plausible decision points with correct logic (eligibility via triage, pre-approval decision, high-value threshold branch post-pre-approval). Descriptions align well with the process (e.g., correct artefact usage, constraint on payment). No violations of "do not introduce" rule ("process gateway" is descriptive, not a new activity/artefact).

**Key strengths (supporting high score):**
- Covers explicit branch (**high-value > €1 000**) precisely, including AuditTrail requirement.
- Documents table includes all artefacts (RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail [noted as high-value], BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF), with accurate "where required" details directly from process/constraints.
- No legacy activity mentioned.

**Strict deductions (significant point loss for differences vs. ground truth):**
- **Decision points mismatch (-1.5):** LLM identifies 3 (eligibility, pre-approval, threshold), but frames differently: separates **Financial Pre-Approval** as #2 (good inference, but GT bundles pre-approval + auditor into single #3 "Final payment approval"); threshold as #3 (GT has as #2). Misses explicit "auditor review decision" (GT implies via #3); no clear reject branches/outcomes for any (GT specifies for all 3: e.g., "Not eligible → rejected/returned"; "Rejected → ends without payment").
- **Structure/phrasing differences (-0.3):** List + descriptive paragraphs vs. GT's precise table (#, point name, branching logic). Names differ (e.g., "Eligibility Validation" vs. "*Eligibility check*"; no "*Final payment approval*"). Heading "Required Documents (Artefacts)" vs. "Complete list..."; table adds unasked "Where it is required" (accurate but extraneous).
- **Minor omissions (-0.2):** No equivalent to GT's disclaimer "(No other documents or legacy activities...)"; less explicit on rejection flows or "catalogue" inclusion of conditional AuditTrail.

Score reflects ~85% match: excellent fidelity to prompt/process, but non-identical decision framing/structure/phrasing = notable differences under "utmost strictness."
