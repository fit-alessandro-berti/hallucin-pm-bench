9.0

- **A1:** Perfectly correct.

- **A2:** Perfectly correct sequence. No issues.

- **A3:** The LLM lists "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock", matching the correct set. However, the activities are not shown with underscores ("Arrange_Delivery" vs. "Arrange_Delivery"), but that's a minor formatting divergence. However, since the instructions state to penalize even small deviations, and the prompt requests one activity per line and alphabetic order (which the LLM follows), the only issue is the minor formatting (lack of underscores).

Therefore, there is a minor formatting error (no underscores for activity names). Since the prompt says to be strict, I take off 1 full point for this formatting miss on two answers.

**Final: 9.0**
