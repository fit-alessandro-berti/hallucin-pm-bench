9.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth both in verdicts and logic for each rule, and overall result. It displays impressive precision and concise justifications. However, there are minor issues in wording that, per strictness, warrant deduction:

- For R2, the LLM gives a technical justification (Ship Goods before new Manager Approval), which is accurate for R5, while the ground truth justification for R2 focuses on the 2-day requirement after the final approval (post-Change Request approval)—it could be clearer that the timing fails because Ship_Goods occurred before the re-approval, thus "after the last required approval" is not met.
- For R5, the LLM says: "Ship Goods, Receive Goods, Pay Invoice occurred before required new Manager Approval." The ground truth correctly lists only Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice (Receive_Goods happens after the new Manager Approval, so should not be included).

Otherwise, all rule statuses, and the overall result, are strictly correct. The justifications are all ≤20 words and align very closely with those in the ground truth. 

Strictly, the above wording/logic issues should lead to a reduction to 9.0.
