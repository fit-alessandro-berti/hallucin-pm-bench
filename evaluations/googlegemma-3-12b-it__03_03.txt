8.0

The LLM answer produces a semantically equivalent BPMN 2.0 XML model to the ground truth, with identical flow structure, element types, and connections (15 sequence flows matching the required paths, including the validation loop, warranty decision, and parallel activities). No extra or omitted elements, and no hallucinated flows. All required tasks, gateways, start event, and exactly two end events are present. However, strict deductions apply for the following small but explicit errors versus the ground truth and prompt:

- Process ID lacks "wrc_" prefix ("WarrantyReplacementProcess" vs. ground truth "wrc_process"), violating the prompt's rule to prefix every element's ID.
- Minor task name mismatch: "Requests missing information" vs. ground truth "Request missing information" (not verbatim to prompt's "requests missing information"; pluralization and capitalization differ).
- Start event name differs ("Customer submits an online warranty claim" vs. ground truth "Online warranty claim submitted"), not matching ground truth and slightly diverging from prompt verbatim.
- End event names differ ("Rejection"/"Completion" vs. "Rejected"/"Successful end").
- Gateway names differ entirely (e.g., "Claim Completeness" vs. "Claim complete?", "Warranty Eligibility" vs. "Within warranty?"), with parallel gateways unnecessarily named in LLM (ground truth omits names).
- Sequence flows lack condition names (e.g., no "Yes"/"No" labels as in ground truth).
- Non-semantic XML differences: `isExecutable="true"` vs. ground truth "false"; extra unnecessary namespaces (bpmndi, omgdc, omgdi); process has extraneous name attribute; definitions lacks ID; more verbose/less consistent IDs (e.g., camelCase vs. ground truth snake_case, though different IDs alone allow full credit per rubric).

These accumulate to warrant a moderate deduction despite core equivalence; the model is functional and complete but not pixel-perfect to the ground truth or prompt's verbatim rules.
