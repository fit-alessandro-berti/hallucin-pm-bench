The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks for the two parallel splits in Process B and numbers them in order. It uses curly braces and a comma to present the concurrent tasks and gives no information about Processes A or C, as instructed.

Strictly speaking, the answer omits the explicit labeling of which parallel block each set corresponds to (i.e., "first parallel block", "second parallel block"), and does not state that "no other tasks in Process B can run in parallel", which the ground truth adds for completeness. The LLM also uses curly braces instead of the `A â€– B` notation and does not bold the set numbers or the "Set #" labels as in the ground truth.

These are relatively small stylistic omissions and do not affect the factual correctness, but per the instruction for utmost strictness and that "small errors should reflect in significant loss of points", the missing explicit attributions and nuances warrant a deduction. Therefore, the answer is rated 9.0.
