The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two concurrent task sets in the exact order they appear in Process B, with precise task names matching the ground truth. It adheres strictly to the prompt by focusing only on Process B and providing no extraneous information. Deductions are applied for minor formatting differences (e.g., using simple curly braces `{}` instead of descriptive labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**" and the `‖` parallel symbol; omitting the explanatory sentence "No other tasks...") and lack of bold/backtick styling, which slightly deviates from the ground truth's presentation under utmost strictness.
