9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and comprehensive, closely aligning with the ground truth in content, structure, and adherence to the prompt's requirements (e.g., using exact activity names like "Underwriter Alignment Gate" and avoiding standard loan terminology). All three decision points are correctly identified and described without omissions or inventions. The required documents list matches exactly in items and order, with phrasing that faithfully reflects the process description (e.g., including "single pay-stub or tax slip" and "(CIS) template," which the ground truth slightly abbreviates).

**Minor deductions (-1.0 total):** 
- Phrasing variations in decision points: Includes step numbers (e.g., "(Step 5)") not present in ground truth; uses "> 2 points" (accurate but explicit vs. ground truth's implicit "else"); adds parenthetical "(only for amounts ≥ €15 000)" (correct but extraneous detail); lowercase/italicized "approve" or "reject" vs. ground truth's bold/capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**").
- Documents: Adds "old" in "≤ 3 months old" (matches original process but expands ground truth's "≤ 3 months"); uses "or" instead of "/" in "single pay-stub or tax slip" (minor stylistic difference).
- Omits ground truth's positional context (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split") and the closing note on excluded documents, but these are not required by the prompt.
- Overall structure uses bullets under numbered points (functional but differs from ground truth's inline descriptions).

No major errors, hallucinations, or deviations; differences are superficial and do not alter meaning. Under utmost strictness, this warrants a high score but not perfect due to phrasing and formatting variances.
