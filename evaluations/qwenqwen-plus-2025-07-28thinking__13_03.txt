7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Score contribution: 9.0/10)**: The count is correct (1 occurrence, tied to CaseID 1002). The added explanation of differing strings is accurate and data-derived, with no errors. However, the ground truth is minimal ("1"), so minor elaboration deducts slightly under strict criteria—no speculation, but unnecessary detail deviates from brevity.
  
- **Part 2 (Score contribution: 6.0/10)**: Core idea of small sample unrepresentativeness is present (3 cases, short timeframe), and word limit is met (119). Strengths: Notes limited scope vs. full month and potential biases (e.g., sampling, data quality like duplicates). However, significant differences vs. ground truth: 
  - Misses quantitative sampling error emphasis (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence interval, rare-event volatility).
  - Omits key point on string-matching distortion (strict vs. fuzzy with near-synonyms like "Automatic Fraud Check").
  - Introduces speculation (e.g., high-volume periods, applicant types, system updates, weekends)—violates "no speculation" rule, unlike ground truth's data-focused stats and matching issues.
  - These omissions and extras create substantive divergence, warranting major deduction despite overall relevance.

Overall: Strong on facts, but Q2's speculative elements and missed statistical/string insights reduce alignment under utmost strictness.
