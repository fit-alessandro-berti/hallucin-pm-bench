• The LLM correctly lists the three new tasks ("Verify Identity", "Request Additional Documents", "Final Reject") and the removed task ("Reject Loan") with proper IDs—matching the ground truth.
• It unnecessarily lists "Task_ApproveLoan (name changed to 'Auto-Approve Loan')" under "Added tasks," even though this task is not added (it exists in both versions, only the name changed), which is explicitly instructed to be ignored. This is a significant but not catastrophic error.
• The gateway change is correctly identified (exclusive → inclusive), though the mention of the gateway name change ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check") is not required, but not penalized heavily.
• No extra missing or invented tasks.

This answer contains one notable mistake (falsely identifying Task_ApproveLoan as a new task), resulting in a significant loss of points, but not a total misunderstanding. All other items are correct.
