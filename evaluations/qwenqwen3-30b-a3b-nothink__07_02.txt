### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but introduces errors that violate the prompt's strict instructions (e.g., ignore cosmetic renamings). Under utmost strictness, these inaccuracies warrant a moderate deduction:

- **Added tasks**: Correctly identifies the three new tasks (`Task_VerifyIdentity`, `Task_RequestDocs`, `Task_FinalReject`) but erroneously includes `Task_ApproveLoan` as "added" due to its name change ("Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan"). This task exists in both versions with only a cosmetic rename, which the prompt explicitly instructs to ignore. This is a significant content error (extraneous entry), costing ~2 points.

- **Removed tasks**: Fully accurate, matching the ground truth (`Task_RejectLoan`). No deduction.

- **Gateway-type changes**: Correctly notes the type change (exclusive → inclusive) for `Gateway_Decision`. However, it appends a name change detail ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check"), which is cosmetic and should be ignored per the prompt. This extraneous detail is a smaller but non-trivial error (strictness requires no inclusion), costing ~1 point.

Overall, the structure follows the required headings, and ~80% of content is precise, but the inclusion of ignorable elements inflates changes inaccurately, preventing a higher score. No other unmentioned changes (e.g., flows) are fabricated, which avoids further penalties.
