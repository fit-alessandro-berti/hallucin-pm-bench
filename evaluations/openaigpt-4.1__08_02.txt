1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1, asserting "No" when the ground truth is "Yes," and provides a flawed explanation that misinterprets the Petri net's paths (ignoring the T2-T7-T4 route that enables T5 without T3). No valid sequence is given, and the reasoning contradicts the structure (T5 can consume P2 directly via the alternative path). This complete reversal of the correct outcome warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
