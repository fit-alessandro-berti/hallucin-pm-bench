The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses each rule with appropriate reasoning, matching the ground truth in substance: Rule 1 satisfied (QE precedes RA, implicitly once each via step references), Rule 2 satisfied (VP after QE/RA for High severity), Rule 3 violated (NA before RA completion), Rule 4 satisfied (CC after NA/VP). Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly stating "once each" for Rule 1 (small omission per strictness); (2) not emphasizing "both QE and RA" in Rule 3 phrasing; (3) bullet format vs. ground truth table, introducing presentation differences despite equivalent content.
