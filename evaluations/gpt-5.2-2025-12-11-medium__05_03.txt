**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H` duration (matches SLA timing intent); connects to existing `Activity_AMReview` via sequence flow; uses only added elements (no new activities); one-sentence justification is concise and explains reuse of existing escalation.
- **Major deductions (-2.0 total)**:
  - `cancelActivity="false"` (non-interrupting) vs. ground truth `"true"` (interrupting): Critical semantic error. Non-interrupting allows `CreateAccount` to continue post-timeout (parallel execution to `ActivateAccount`, risking token duplication/messy flow), failing strict SLA *enforcement*. Interrupting cancels the task for proper escalation—significant functional deviation.
- **Minor deductions (-1.0 total)**:
  - Different IDs (`Boundary_SLA48h`/`Flow_SLA_01` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`/`Flow_LateEscalation`), names, and no matching comments (e.g., `<!-- ❶ -->`): Non-matching elements reduce XML fidelity.
  - Justification mismatch: Describes "non-interrupting" and "triggers escalation path" vs. ground truth's "interrupting" and precise phrasing/bolding—alters intent.
- Overall: Functionally close (~70% alignment) but key enforcement flaw + textual diffs prevent higher score under utmost strictness.
