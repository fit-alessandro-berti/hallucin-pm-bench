**8.5**

- Q1 matches ground truth closely (number + cases listed), minor wording diffs ("distinct cases:" vs "cases (...)") deduct 0.5.
- Q2 correct activity but adds unrequested timestamps/full sentence vs ground truth's single word; violates "concise" instruction, deducts 1.0.
- Q3 matches core answer but adds "appears exactly once" phrase vs minimal ground truth, deducts 0.5.
- Overall: Fully correct content, bullet format followed, but verbosity and minor phrasing diffs prevent perfect score under strict criteria.
