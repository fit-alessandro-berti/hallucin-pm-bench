### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is comprehensive and adheres to the prompt by not introducing undefined activities or artefacts (e.g., no mention of the legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide"). It correctly identifies and lists all 7 required documents from the process description, matching the ground truth exactly in content and completeness (including the note on *AuditTrail* applicability). However, it significantly deviates in the summarization of decision points, which is a core part of the prompt. Under strict evaluation:

- **Decision points differences (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: 
  - Ground truth concisely identifies exactly 3 decision points in a table format, combining related approvals (e.g., final payment approval spans *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* and *Senior_Auditor_Review*).
  - LLM expands to 5 explicit points plus an additional "gate" (point 5), over-splitting and introducing interpretive elements (e.g., separate "High-value branch" as point 3, which ground truth integrates into point 2; a new "Gate before Process_Refund_Payment" that restates constraints rather than a distinct decision). This adds unnecessary granularity and phrasing (e.g., "Key outcome" details, assumptions about *BankTransferAuthorization* preparation), inflating the response beyond the ground truth's succinct structure. Small interpretive additions (e.g., "process cannot legitimately continue" vs. ground truth's "claim rejected/returned") count as minor errors under strictness.

- **Structural and stylistic differences (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**:
  - LLM uses a verbose, numbered list with sub-bullets for outcomes and documents-per-point, while ground truth uses a clean table for decisions and a simple numbered list for documents. This makes the LLM response longer and less aligned, though not factually wrong.

Overall, the answer is accurate in substance (80% alignment) but loses points for over-elaboration, mismatched decision count/structure, and minor phrasing variances, resulting in a mid-range score. A perfect match would require mirroring the ground truth's conciseness and exact 3-point breakdown.
