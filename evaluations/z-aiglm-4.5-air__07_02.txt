7.5

### Evaluation Notes
- **Strengths**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (3 items), the single removed task, and the exact gateway type change (exclusive to inclusive). No extraneous changes are mentioned, aligning with the prompt's focus on tasks and gateways only (ignoring renamings like task/gateway names or flows).
- **Weaknesses (leading to deductions)**: 
  - Added/Removed tasks: Lists only IDs without names (e.g., "Verify Identity" is omitted), which is a significant omission as names are core to describing changes; ground truth prioritizes names with IDs in parentheses. This results in incomplete summaries (~20% loss).
  - Gateway-type changes: Lacks precision on XOR/OR notation and version specificity (v1 to v2), using capitalized "Exclusive/Inclusive" instead of lowercase; misses the explanatory parentheticals (~15% loss).
  - Formatting: Introduces an unrequested "Summary of Changes" header; uses dashed bullets instead of numbered lists; headings are close but not exact (e.g., "#### Added tasks" vs. "* **Added tasks**"). No final note confirming "no other changes" (~10% loss).
  - Strictness applied: These are not "cosmetic" but substantive differences in completeness and fidelity to ground truth structure/detail, warranting a mid-high score rather than perfect.
