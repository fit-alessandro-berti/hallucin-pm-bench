9.5

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, matching the lists under all three headings. It uses the correct task IDs and names, and accurately identifies the gateway-type change. However, there are very minor differences, such as the lack of name and ID pairing in the lists ("Verify Identity" (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)), as seen in the ground truth, and a slightly less explicit description in the Gateway-type changes section. According to the instruction to be "utmost strict", these minor omissions (mainly missing the explicit pairing of task name and ID) cost half a point. Thus, the answer is scored as 9.5.
