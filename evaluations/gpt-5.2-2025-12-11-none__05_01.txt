**3.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Criteria):
- **Major differences (severe deductions)**: Wrong attachment point (Task_RequestDocs vs. Task_Receive: -3.0). Wrong event type (non-interrupting vs. interrupting: -2.0; non-interrupting creates parallel execution, failing to properly bypass). Imprecise/vague timer ("48h after Start_Claim" vs. exact `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`: -1.0; ignores BPMN semantics where boundary duration starts at activity start).
- **Minor differences (further deductions)**: No event ID (Timer_48h: -0.5). No BPMN XML syntax. Extraneous "optional escalation" and "reuse existing target" phrasing (-0.5).
- **Similarities (partial credit)**: Adds boundary timer + new sequenceFlow to Task_Triage (+1.0). References IDs (partial). Explains bypassing docs/SLA (+1.0). No new tasks, plain English, ≤120 words (+1.0).
- **Overall**: Fundamentally different solution with technical inaccuracies; ~30% match to ground truth. Does not replicate the exact proposed fix.
