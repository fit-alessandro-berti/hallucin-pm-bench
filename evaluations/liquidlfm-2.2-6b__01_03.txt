### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 1.5/10):**  
The ground truth identifies exactly two decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate) with precise, one-sentence rules matching the process description. The LLM answer severely deviates by fabricating six irrelevant "decision points" (e.g., treating routine steps like receiving Form 14B or assigning a Deck Officer as decisions, which are not gates or branches). It omits the core risk-skip rule entirely and inverts it (claiming low/medium risk skips *to* Manual Underwriting, when it actually skips step 5). The TriVote description is also wrong (requiring "all three" with "at least one vote" instead of "any two of three"). No actual decision points are correctly summarized, violating the "one sentence each" requirement and introducing hallucinations. This is a near-total failure under strict evaluation.

**Part (b) - Documents (Score: 4.5/10):**  
The ground truth lists nine documents in precise first-appearance order, including the three scorecards as explicit inputs to the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (step 3). The LLM omits the scorecards entirely (a major hallucination-equivalent error, as they are core process elements) and incorrectly orders items (e.g., placing "Signed Offer Sheet 77" after "Loan Dossier 2025," when step 8 precedes step 9). It correctly identifies five documents but duplicates/treats "Signed Offer Sheet 77" oddly as a sixth, and the note adds unnecessary speculation. This partial accuracy is undermined by omissions and sequencing errors, warranting significant deductions.

**Overall Score Calculation:**  
Averaged from parts (weighted equally), with strict penalties for small errors (e.g., missing scorecards = -3 points; rule inversions = -2 points each; invented points = -4 points total). The answer shows superficial familiarity but fundamental inaccuracies, far from ground truth fidelity. No policy violations in the LLM answer itself.
