6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Full match (status and justification essence). +2.0
- **R2**: Major errorâ€”incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and missed the post-change approval timing, leading to invalid "within 2 days" assessment. -4.0 (significant deviation, as it ignores rule interaction with R5).
- **R3**: Full match. +2.0
- **R4**: Full match. +2.0
- **R5**: Status matches, but justification is less precise (omits specific steps like Ship_Goods/Pay_Invoice before new approval). Minor deduction. +1.5
- **R6**: Full match. +2.0
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by R2 error affecting compliance assessment. +0.5

Total reflects strict scoring: core structure followed, but critical factual error in R2 (affects multiple rules) results in substantial penalty despite correct overall conclusion.
