- R1: Correct (Compliant), justification is sufficient.
- R2: Incorrect (should be Violated). LLM fails to recognize that after a Change_Request, a new Manager_Approval is required before "Ship_Goods"; LLM incorrectly measures from the initial Finance_Approval instead of the required post-change Manager_Approval. This is a significant error.
- R3: Correct (Violated).
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable).
- R5: Correct (Violated), though justification is too brief ("no new Manager_Approval before further steps" could be clearer regarding which steps).
- R6: Correct (Compliant).

Most crucially, R2 is a major compliance failure missed. The LLM answer otherwise follows structure and is mostly concise, but this substantial oversight and slightly vague justifications warrant a notable deduction.
