The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in correct alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), ignores Process A, and uses the specified one-pair-per-line format. No extra or missing pairs.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Second line lacks precise alignment spaces before the em dash (ground truth uses 5 spaces after "Procure_Materials" for vertical alignment of em dashes in monospace; LLM uses only ~2 spaces, mismatching the format consistency).
- First line has extraneous trailing whitespace ("Quality_Check  " with 2 extra spaces; ground truth has none).
- Minor inconsistencies in spaces around em dashes compared to the prompt's example format and ground truth precision.
- Possible leading whitespace difference in rendering (LLM shows extra newline before first pair).

These are small whitespace/formatting errors, but per instructions, they warrant significant deduction (~1.0 total) despite perfect semantics/content. Byte-for-byte identical would be 10.0.
