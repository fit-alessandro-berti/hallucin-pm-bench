9.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
**Strengths (minimal deductions):**
- **Part a**: Identifies exactly the two decision points. Rules described accurately in one sentence each. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "skip" vs. "bypasses; otherwise proceeds"; "proceeds...give approval" vs. "advance...record 'Approve'"; title wording) are semantically equivalent but not identical (-0.3). No omissions or hallucinations.
- **Part b**: Exact list of 9 documents in correct first-appearance order, matching ground truth content precisely. Distinguishes "Offer Sheet 77" from "Signed Offer Sheet 77" correctly.

**Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness on differences):**
- Added unrequested extras: descriptive phrases (e.g., "– Received at the start of the process (Step 1)"), parentheticals (e.g., "*(only required if Step 4 condition fails)*"), and a full **Note** section explaining inputs/conditionals/universality (-0.5). Ground truth is a bare, concise list without annotations.
- Formatting differences: Headers (e.g., "### **a) Summary...**"), excessive bolding, numbering styles diverge from ground truth's simple "**a)** 1./2." structure (-0.2).
- No factual errors or hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), but verbosity creates textual divergence warranting deduction under "utmost strictness" and "small errors...significant loss."

Overall: Semantically perfect (10.0 potential), but penalized heavily for non-minimalist presentation and additions deviating from ground truth's exact style/content (-1.0 total).
