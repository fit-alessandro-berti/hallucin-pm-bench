### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), adheres to the required headings (using the bullet format from the system prompt), and avoids speculation. However, it loses significant points for incompleteness in task descriptions: it lists only IDs, omitting the exact `name` attributes from the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" for `check_vip`), which the ground truth includes for full factual representation. The gateway change phrasing is concise but misses the version qualifiers (v1/v2) present in the ground truth. No extraneous content is added, but these omissions in detail and formatting alignment with the ground truth's descriptive style warrant a deduction from a perfect score, per strict criteria.
