7.0

• The LLM answer correctly identifies the added and removed tasks by their element names and the gateway type change, matching the facts as presented in the XML.
• However, it omits the descriptive task names for the added and removed tasks, as present in the ground truth answer ("Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code" with their respective IDs, instead of just IDs; same for "Send RMA Label").  
• The gateway type change correctly uses the element name and the types but could be slightly clearer by bolding or distinguishing the gateway types, as in the ground truth.
• The LLM answer uses bullet points rather than the exact section headings used in the ground truth ("Added tasks", etc.). It uses a dash instead of bullet/star for items, resulting in a minor formatting difference.
• Section headings are lowercase rather than matching the ground truth's formatting.

Given the requirement for utmost strictness and significant point loss for even small deviations, these issues justify a significant deduction from the maximum score.
