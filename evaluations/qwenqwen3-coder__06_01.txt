The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials with Schedule_Machines, and Quality_Check with Create_Documentation). However, it violates the strict formatting requirements in two significant ways: (1) within the second pair, the tasks are not alphabetized (Quality_Check precedes Create_Documentation, but "C" comes before "Q" alphabetically); (2) the overall list is not in alphabetical order (the pair starting with "P" appears before the pair starting with "C"). Additionally, the spacing around the em dash (—) does not match the specified format precisely, though this is minor. Under utmost strictness, these errors—directly contradicting the prompt's explicit instructions on ordering—result in substantial point deduction, despite the correct task identification. No other pairs are present, aligning with the ground truth rationale.
