8.0

The LLM answer includes both of the correct pairs. However, there are formatting mistakes:

- The tasks in each pair are not ordered alphabetically within the pair. For example, "Quality_Check — Create_Documentation" should be "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" to match alphabetical order.
- The answer does not use the required double space padding around the em dash (—), which is strictly specified in the ground truth.
- The output does not include the required monospaced code block formatting as shown in the ground truth, though that point may be context-dependent.

These errors, while not affecting the underlying identification of correct task pairs, are significant given the strictness requested—especially with respect to the alphabetical order within each pair and formatting.

Therefore, I score this answer 8.0.
