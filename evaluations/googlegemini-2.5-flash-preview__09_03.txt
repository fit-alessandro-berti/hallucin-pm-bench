The LLM answer correctly recognizes that no computation can be performed due to lack of data, and it accurately identifies the columns and missing values as the reason. However, compared to the ground truth answer, it lacks a small amount of precision and detail. For example, it does not explicitly mention that all event rows are missing (it just refers to "the full event log"), nor does it explicitly state the requirement for concrete times for the “Approve Invoice” activity. While it is concise, it could be made clearer by specifying that every relevant value was redacted and raw entries are required. This lack of completeness and specificity causes a deduction of points, but since the core rationale is present and no incorrect information is given, it remains a strong answer.
