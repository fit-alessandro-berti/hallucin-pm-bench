The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, matching every rule's status and providing accurate, concise justifications. Minor differences in justification phrasing exist but do not alter the substance. The only significant loss is for slightly less clarity and specificity in the R2 justification (focusing on sequence more than the >2 days aspect), and R5's justification could mention Pay_Invoice in addition to Ship_Goods, as in the ground truth. Both are minor but notable. Otherwise, the answer is highly accurate and precise.
