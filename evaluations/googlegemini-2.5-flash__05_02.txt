The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the exact same XML modification (changing `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" for the "Collect Equipment" task) as the ground truth, adhering strictly to the rules without adding/deleting elements or unnecessary changes, and provides a concise one-sentence rationale that effectively explains the SLA improvement in terms of cycle time reduction; minor deductions for the diff including extraneous file headers and multi-line context (beyond a pure single hunk) and the rationale's slightly less precise wording (lacking explicit reference to the "3-day SLA" and "no new activities").
