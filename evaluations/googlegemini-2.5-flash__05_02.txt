9.0

The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth answer. The unified diff is **identical** to the expected answer, both in content and context. The rationale differs very slightly: while both reference reducing the due date and resulting SLA compliance, the LLM's formulation ("directly decreases the longest individual task duration, thereby shortening the overall process cycle time and improving SLA compliance") is accurate but slightly less explicit regarding the process now being kept "inside the contractual 3-day SLA" as in the ground truth.

This is a minor omission in terms of explicitness about the SLA boundary specifically being 3 days, though the improvement rationale is correct and the increment is within task (only attributes, not structure change).

Given the evaluation guidance that even small errors should cause significant point loss, the lack of stating the 3-day contractual SLA is cause for the 1-point reduction.

**Summary:**  
- Correct, compliant diff: **No error**
- Rationale: Clear, but not as explicit as ground truth re: specific SLA duration: **-1.0**

**Final score: 9.0**
