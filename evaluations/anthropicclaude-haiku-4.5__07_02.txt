6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core changes (added tasks: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject; removed task: Reject Loan; gateway change: exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision), aligning with the ground truth on the essential facts. However, under utmost strictness, several deviations warrant significant point deductions:

- **Extra interpretive details**: In "Added tasks," phrases like "(inserted before Review Application)," "(new conditional branch)," and "(replaces simple Reject with named variant)" add unrequested positional/flow context and imply a "replacement" narrative, which blurs the strict separation of "added" vs. "removed" categories. The ground truth is a plain list without such elaboration. Similarly, "Removed tasks" includes "(replaced by Task_FinalReject)," which introduces subjective linkage not present in the ground truth or required by the prompt. These inflate the summary beyond a strict enumeration, deducting ~1.5 points.

- **Inclusion of ignored elements**: The "Gateway-type changes" section mentions the name change ("Eligible?" â†’ "Eligibility Check"), directly violating the prompt's instruction to "Ignore cosmetic renamings." Additionally, it adds explanatory text on gateway logic (e.g., "Single decision point... mutually exclusive" and "Multiple simultaneous paths possible... overlap in inclusive logic"), which is extraneous and not in the ground truth's concise description. This contravenes the "strictly under the three requested headings" directive, deducting ~1.5 points.

- **Structural minor issues**: The LLM uses markdown headings (##) and bolding inconsistently with the ground truth's format (* **Heading** with numbered lists), but this is cosmetic and deducts only ~0.5 points.

Overall, while factually accurate at a high level, the additions of interpretation, explanations, and ignored renamings make it less precise and adherent to the prompt's constraints compared to the ground truth's brevity and purity. A perfect 10.0 requires near-exact matching in content, structure, and adherence.
