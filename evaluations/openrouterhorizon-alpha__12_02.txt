The LLM answer correctly states “No” and identifies the main counterexamples: C003, where Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order, and C005, where Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order event. This aligns with the ground truth.

However, there are two significant deductions:

1. The answer goes further to discuss C002, mentioning that Validate_Payment does not “immediately” follow Receive_Order due to the Check_Inventory activity in between. The original claim under scrutiny refers to “always follows,” not “immediately follows,” so the immediate sequence is not required by the claim. This is an incorrect expansion of the argument and could mislead a strict evaluator.

2. The answer is slightly more verbose than necessary as per the ground truth, introducing a potential for confusion by pulling in extraneous detail.

These issues show a lack of perfect alignment with the ground truth and demonstrate a failure to follow the instruction to judge only against the exact wording of the claim, resulting in a loss of 2 points. The key reasoning and correct negative conclusion are both sound, which avoids a lower score.
