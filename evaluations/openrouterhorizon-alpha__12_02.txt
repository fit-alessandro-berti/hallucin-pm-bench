7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the "No" verdict and accurately highlights the primary counterexamples in cases C003 (Validate_Payment preceding Receive_Order, citing lines 6 and 7) and C005 (Validate_Payment without any Receive_Order, citing lines 11–12), which directly align with the ground truth's focus on these violations to disprove the "always follows" claim. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs a significant deduction for erroneously claiming a violation in C002 (citing lines 3 and 5 with intervening Check_Inventory on line 4), as "follows" means sequential order after Receive_Order (which holds here), not immediate succession—this misinterpretation introduces a factual error not present in the ground truth, inflating the justification with an invalid counterexample and weakening precision. Minor formatting differences (e.g., no bolding of activities) are negligible, but the core analytical flaw justifies the score below perfect.
