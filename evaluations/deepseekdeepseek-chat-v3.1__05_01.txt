3.5

The LLM answer proposes adding a non-interrupting boundary timer event on Task_RequestDocs, which would divert to Task_Triage after 48 hours. However, the business rule clearly states the 48-hour timer starts from claim submission (i.e., process start), not from the point a case reaches Task_RequestDocs. According to the ground truth, the timer must be attached to Task_Receive (the first task after claim submission) so that any process delays — even those before missing docs are detected/requested — will still trigger escalation at 48 hours. Placing the timer on Task_RequestDocs could create SLA breaches for claims stuck earlier in the process. Also, the ground truth specifies an interrupting timer, but the LLM suggests a non-interrupting event, which risks duplicate or out-of-order flow. Furthermore, the LLM extends the process by a new event and sequence flow as allowed, but the start point and type are incorrect. This demonstrates a critical misunderstanding (start point and event type), thus a strict score reflects significant loss for failing to meet the prompt and SLA.
