The LLM answer correctly identifies the non-compliance ("No") and provides a short justification referencing all four rules, with accurate assessments: Rule 1 satisfied (explicitly notes both occur once and in order), Rule 2 satisfied (after both reviews), Rule 3 violated (NA before RA), and Rule 4 satisfied (after NA and VP). It closely aligns with the ground truth in substance and reasoning, including the key violation in Rule 3. Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly referencing "both QE and RA" in Rule 3's reasoning (ground truth emphasizes this for clarity); (2) omitting an explicit overall non-compliance summary; and (3) using bullet points instead of a table for structure, which slightly reduces precision in presentation despite the prompt allowing a "short justification."
