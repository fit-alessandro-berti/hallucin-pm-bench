The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly stating that the value cannot be derived/computed, and provides a clear, data-driven explanation focused on the absence of timestamps and durations, mirroring the ground truth's reasoning. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., not explicitly mentioning "ordering information" or the risk of fabrication) and unnecessary but accurate reference to the historical benchmark (which adds detail without contradicting the core message).
