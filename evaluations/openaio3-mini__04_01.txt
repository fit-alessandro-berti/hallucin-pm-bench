The LLM answer correctly identifies the non-compliance and accurately justifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with appropriate citations to events, aligning with the ground truth on those points. However, it deducts points for incompleteness: it fails to evaluate or justify the satisfied rules (1, 4, and 5), which the ground truth does exhaustively, providing a full audit. This omission represents a meaningful difference in thoroughness, especially under strict evaluation criteria requiring close alignment. Minor deductions also for not specifying "distance = 3" in Rule 3 justification (ground truth is more precise).
