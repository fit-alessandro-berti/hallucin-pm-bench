### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: Major errors. The LLM missed the "check_vip" task entirely (a clear addition visible in v2 XML after "receive_request"). It only partially captured "generate_qr" but used the ID ("Generate_qr") instead of the exact name ("Generate RMA QR Code") as implied by ground truth and XML. Additionally, it included speculative positioning ("new task added between approve_return and end"), violating the "do not speculate" rule. This section is ~50% incomplete and non-compliant (significant point loss).
- **Removed tasks**: Complete failure. The LLM incorrectly stated "(none)", ignoring the removal of "send_rma_label" (present in v1, absent in v2). This is a factual omission from the XML (strict loss for missing a core difference).
- **Gateway type changes**: Mostly accurate but with minor phrasing issues (e.g., "ExclusiveGateway gw_valid (RMA_v1) replaced by inclusiveGateway gw_valid (RMA_v2)" vs. ground truth's concise "changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"). No IDs or extras, but lacks exact XML casing/emphasis. Minor deduction.
- **Overall**: Headings match prompt exactly (positive), but content has critical omissions (one added, one removed missed) and speculation, deviating substantially from ground truth. Strict scoring reflects ~70% inaccuracy; no partial credit for gateway alone.
