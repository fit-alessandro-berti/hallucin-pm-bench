**9.5**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and rounding (1; 2.08%; 8.33%). Formatting is clear and precise.

For Q3 (≤100 words: ~85 words, compliant): Covers (i) single occurrence explicitly ("only once"); (iii) cautions against over-generalization ("generalizing ... skew ... overfit ... fail to capture ... inadequate"); (ii) notes instability implicitly via "exceptional/irregular ... rare conditions ... underrepresented scenarios," linking to skewed efficiency/insights/overfitting. Minor deduction (-0.5) for not explicitly addressing statistical variance/noise/skewed averages/confidence intervals as in ground truth sample (e.g., no mention of cycle time or model collapse to 0%). Strict evaluation penalizes subtlety in (ii), but variation allowed and core met.
