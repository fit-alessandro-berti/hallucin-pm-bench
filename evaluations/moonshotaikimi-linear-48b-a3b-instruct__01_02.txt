3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points Section (Major Errors, ~50% of Prompt Weight)**: 
  - Includes "Quick KYC Verification (KYC)" as a decision point, which is incorrect—it's a mandatory verification step, not a branching decision (ground truth omits it entirely). This introduces a fabrication and violates the "exact terminology and flow" instruction.
  - "Underwriter Alignment Gate": Phrasing is mostly accurate but inverted ("if > 2 points, escalates" vs. ground truth's "≤ 2 continue, else escalate"), creating a subtle but strict deviation in condition logic. No mention of it being a "branch after Dual Underwriter Split."
  - "Amount Threshold Decision": Close match, but misses placement "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" and uses "**≥ €15 000**" vs. ground truth's "< €15 000" for auto-approve (equivalent but not identical phrasing). Ground truth specifies "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval."
  - Completely omits the third decision point: "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" as a voting decision (approve/reject), which is explicitly a decision in the process flow. This is a critical omission.
  - Overall: Only 1.5/3 points are partially correct; the section distorts the process by adding irrelevant content and missing a key branch.

- **Required Documents Section (~50% of Prompt Weight)**:
  - List is identical in content and uses exact terminology (no introductions of standard loan terms).
  - Minor formatting/phrasing diffs (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "CIS template" vs. "CIS") are small but, per strictness, deduct points for not matching precisely.
  - Omits ground truth's parenthetical note on exclusions, but this isn't required by the prompt, so minimal impact.

- **General**: Response uses activity names correctly where applied but fails to "summarise the decision points" accurately per the process flow. Strict deduction for errors: ~6.5 points lost for decision flaws, 0.5 for doc tweaks. Total reflects partial accuracy in one section but fundamental failures in identifying/summarizing decisions.
