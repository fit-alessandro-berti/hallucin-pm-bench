The LLM answer is factually perfect, correctly identifies "No" with identical case-by-case analysis (C001 yes, C002 no via Pack_Items, C003 yes, C004 no via Check_Fraud), cites all relevant sequences accurately from the log (including precise timestamps as supporting evidence), and concludes correctly that "always" is violated. Structure uses a highly similar table format for justification, fulfilling the task precisely.

**Minor deductions (-0.2 total, per strictness on differences):**  
- Table headers/columns differ slightly (e.g., "Order of activities (chronological)" + Yes/No vs. "Sequence around Receive_Order" + ✅/❌ + Notes).  
- Sequences include full next activity + timestamps (accurate but more verbose than ground truth's concise "around" focus).  
- Phrasing variances (e.g., "not supported... FACT is inaccurate" vs. "violate the stated rule... claim is inaccurate"; "at least two cases" vs. "two out of the four cases").  
No factual errors, omissions, or deviations from log evidence.
