**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Roles/Headers (major deduction: -3.0)**: LLM uses 3 columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support); Ground Truth (GT) uses 4, introducing "Operations Manager" as a core column with consistent assignments (often **A**). Missing column fundamentally alters the RACI structure; no equivalent in LLM.
- **Tasks/Activities (major deduction: -2.5)**: LLM has 7 rows with interpretive splits (e.g., separate "Release payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message transmission"; added "7. Archive case file"). GT has exactly 6 concise rows mapping source steps directly (e.g., combines release/SWIFT into "Release Payment"; no split/extra row). Names differ (e.g., "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"); GT mandates "(mandated wording)" phrasing.
- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -2.5)**: Near-total mismatch across cells. Examples:
  | Task | LLM | GT | Match? |
  |------|-----|----|--------|
  | 1/Receive | TA R/A, RL I, IT – | TA **R**, RL I, OM **A**, IT C | Partial (RL I); misses OM/IT |
  | 2/Screen | TA R/A, RL C, IT – | TA **R**, RL **A**, OM I, IT C | None |
  | 3/KYC | TA C, RL R/A, IT – | TA C, RL **R**, OM **A**, IT I | Partial (TA C); RL R/A vs **R**, misses others |
  | 4/Approve | TA C, RL R/A, IT I | TA C, RL **R**, OM **A**, IT I | Partial; misses OM |
  | 5/Release | TA R/A, IT C | TA **R**, RL I, OM **A**, IT C | Partial (IT C); extra in LLM |
  | Archive | IT R/A, RL I | TA C, RL I, OM **A**, IT **R** | Partial (RL I, IT resp.); extras/misses |
  - LLM combines R/A; GT uses separate bold **R**/**A**. Dashes (–) vs. full coverage in GT.
- **Vocabulary/Compliance (minor credit: +0.5)**: Correct use of “KYC Review”, “Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”; no forbidden terms. Matches GT here.
- **Structure/Extras (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Markdown table OK, but LLM adds unrequested "Key", "Vocabulary notes", numbering, plurals ("lists"); GT has simple "**Legend**" and bullets. No "(mandated wording)" header note.
- **Overall Fidelity**: Covers source tasks but deviates heavily in interpretation, structure, and exact GT mapping. Strict policy demands near-identical output; cumulative differences yield low score. No credit for "creative" inferences (e.g., splits, combined R/A).
