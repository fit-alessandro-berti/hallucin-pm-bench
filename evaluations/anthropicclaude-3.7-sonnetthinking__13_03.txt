### Evaluation Notes
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (both state "1" occurrence). No deductions.
- **Question 2**: Strong alignment on core issues (small sample size of 3 cases/14 events; naming inconsistencies with examples like "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"; potential for distortion in estimates). LLM stays under 120 words (~85 words) and avoids speculation by tying to visible data patterns. Minor deductions for lacking ground truth's quantitative emphasis (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, sampling error specifics) and adding tangential points (e.g., time-of-day patterns, process variations) not central to ground truth, diluting focus slightly under strict criteria. Overall, highly faithful but not identical in precision.
