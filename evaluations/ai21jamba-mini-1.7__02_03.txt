3.0

- The LLM answer gets Q1 correct (3 cases).
- Q2 is also answered correctly ("Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" for C456).
- Q3 is wrong: The LLM claims "Validate_Order" appears exactly once, but it actually appears twice (C123 and C456). The correct answer is "Cancel_Order," which appears only once.
- Given the explicit instruction to penalize even small mistakes strictly, the Q3 mistake is significant and basic. For 3 questions, getting 1 completely wrong is a large error; thus, the answer cannot be higher than 3/10.
