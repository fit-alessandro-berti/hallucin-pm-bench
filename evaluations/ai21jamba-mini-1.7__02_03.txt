6.0

- The evaluation score is 6.0 due to correctness on questions 1 and 2 (full credit) but a complete error on question 3 (Validate_Order appears twice, not once; Cancel_Order is the correct answer appearing exactly once), resulting in a strict deduction of 4 points for the major factual inaccuracy under utmost strictness criteria. Minor formatting differences (e.g., bullet points vs. A1/A2/A3 labels, omission of case list in A1) incur no additional penalty as they do not affect core accuracy.
