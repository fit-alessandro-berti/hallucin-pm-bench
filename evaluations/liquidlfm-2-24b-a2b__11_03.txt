**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Wrong activities (critical failure, -4.0)**: Identifies Credit Assessment and Risk Review (partial match to ground truth), but selects Fund Disbursement (throughput 60s < 120s SLA: *no breach*, low wait 50s) instead of Legal Approval (900s vs. 600s SLA: +300s breach, 600s wait). Ignores joint SLA breach + high wait criterion; Legal is clearly worst.
- **Incorrect quantification (-3.0)**: All excesses fabricated (e.g., Credit: 935s vs. true +60s; Risk: 180s vs. +300s; Fund: 65s vs. *negative*). Invents metrics (e.g., "300–150", "600–120").
- **Non-data-driven recommendations (-1.5)**: Generic/invented (e.g., "automated document validation" ungrounded; no table data links like cases, times). Ground truth ties to data (e.g., "low-risk files", "peak morning").
- **Minor issues (-0.5)**: Wrong From line; no case totals; structure deviates (dashes for activities, not pure memo flow); under 150 words; no projection.
Total deductions yield 1.0 (minimum): Fundamentally inaccurate, violates "ground in data" core instruction.
