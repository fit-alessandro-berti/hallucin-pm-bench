7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correct overall verdict ("Non-compliant")**: +2.0
- **Identifies exact same violations (Rules 2 & 3) with accurate citations (events, order)**: +3.0
- **Checks all 5 rules comprehensively**: +2.0
- **Penalties (significant deductions for differences/errors)**:
  - Major error: Labels Rule 3 point as "**Rule 3 is satisfied**" despite fully explaining the violation and calling it a violation later (-1.5; contradictory and sloppy, could mislead).
  - Rules not presented in sequential order (1-5); jumps around (Rule 2 first, Rule 1 last) vs. ground truth's logical order (-0.5).
  - Minor phrasing differences (e.g., Rule 4 explanation omits full context of Intern at event 7; extra "also" and "upon closer inspection"; added summary paragraph not in ground truth) (-0.5).
  - Missing "Justification" header; extra bolding and phrasing not matching ground truth style (-0.3).
- **Net**: Strong substantive match (90% alignment) but strict penalties for presentation errors, mislabeling, and deviations yield 7.2. No perfect match.
