3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, ~2.0/3.0 weight):** The LLM correctly uses all four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). This is a strong point, but it does not offset other failures.
  
- **Table Structure and Format (Major Deduction, ~1.0/3.0 weight):** The ground truth uses a role-based column format (columns for each role, with R/A/C/I notations in cells, bolded activities, and dashes for no involvement). The LLM uses a RACI-column format (columns for Responsible/Accountable/etc., roles in cells), which is a valid alternative but deviates from the ground truth's exact structure. No bolding, no "R,A" combined notations, and excessive empty cells instead of explicit dashes or assignments. This is a significant format mismatch under strict evaluation.

- **Activities Coverage (Major Deduction, ~0.5/2.0 weight):** The prompt requires covering "every activity and role described above" without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM correctly identifies the four core activities but adds unauthorized extras ("Escalate for Compliance Officer approval", "Treasury Ops schedules payment", "Treasury Ops releases funds", "Treasury Ops notifies originating analyst"), renames the approval/escalation process, and splits the release/notify into separate rows (violating "do not ... add"). The ground truth consolidates into six precise activities (e.g., "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"), which the LLM fails to match. Conditional elements like "schedules payment" (low-risk only) are mishandled as a full activity.

- **RACI Assignments Accuracy (Major Deduction, ~0.0/2.0 weight):** Assignments are largely incorrect or incomplete compared to ground truth:
  - **Intake Vetting:** LLM assigns R to Front-Office Analyst and A to Compliance Analyst (misses Front A, adds wrong A; ignores Compliance Analyst C, Treasury Ops I).
  - **KYC Review & AML Screening:** LLM assigns only R/A to Compliance Analyst (misses Compliance Officer C, Treasury Ops I).
  - **Risk Scoring:** LLM assigns only R/A to Compliance Analyst (ignores Front-Office Analyst C, Compliance Officer A, Treasury Ops I; ground truth splits R to Compliance Analyst and A to Officer).
  - Added/renamed activities: Completely fabricated assignments (e.g., no Informed/Consulted roles filled; Treasury Ops gets isolated R/A everywhere, ignoring ground truth's I/C for others in "Release Funds").
  - Overall, roles like Compliance Officer and informed/consulted parties are underrepresented or blank, failing to cover "every ... role." No multiples like "R,A" are used.

This response shows basic vocabulary adherence but fails critically on structure, activity fidelity, and assignment precision, resulting in a low score under utmost strictness. Small errors (e.g., blanks vs. dashes) compound to major deviations.
