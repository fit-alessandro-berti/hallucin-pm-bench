7.5

**Part 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1, correctly identifies case).

**Part 2**: Strong coverage of tiny/non-representative sample (3 cases), potential full-log differences, and key string variation insight ("Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). Under word limit.

**Deductions (-2.5 total, strict per instructions)**:
- Misses precise quantification (14 events, <2 hours span, 0%-7% swing per event proportion, wide CI, rare-event sampling error)—core to ground truth's analytical depth on misestimation.
- Minor speculation ("e.g., more manual checks for high-risk applications"), violating "no speculation."
- Less emphasis on statistical volatility ("one extra/missing line") vs. general "lacks context/trends."
