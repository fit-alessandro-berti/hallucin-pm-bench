**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data:
- Q1: Correct count ("1"), synonymous phrasing ("time" vs. "occurrence").
- Q2: Identical result ("5.56%"), correct calculation shown.
- Q3: Precisely lists the case(s) ("A1002").
- Q4: Provides exactly two clear, valid sampling reasons matching ground truth options ("small sample size/high variance"; "temporal bias/time-window bias"), without hallucination or inference beyond the fragment. No deductions needed under strict evaluation, as no errors or deviations exist.
