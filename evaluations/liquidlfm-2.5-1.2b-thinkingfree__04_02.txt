**1.0**

The LLM answer fails to follow the required format entirely: no per-rule (R1–R6) status with ≤20-word justifications; instead, it's unstructured rambling, contradictory (e.g., "COMPLIANT → No violations" then "Non-Compliant"), incomplete analysis (misses R2 violation; partial on R3/R5), and irrelevant boxing/internal notes. Only the final overall matches (NON-COMPLIANT), but format/accuracy differences are total.
