- The LLM answer gives correct responses for all three questions:

  - "Three distinct cases" = 3 cases (C123, C456, C789)
  - "Pack_Items" = activity before Ship_Order in C456
  - "Cancel_Order" = activity that appears exactly once

- However, the LLM omits the exact case values for A1 ("C123, C456, C789"), which are present in the ground truth. This is a missing detail, especially since the ground truth expected listing of case names.
- All other answers are concise and correct.

Due to the omission of the explicit case identifiers in answer 1, 1 point is deducted for lack of completeness/precision in the first bullet.
