The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (matching the "Yes" verdict) and provides a valid, minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, with accurate step-by-step markings and a brief justification of T5's enabling condition based on the inhibitor arc. This directly addresses the prompt's requirements without errors in the sequence or net semantics.

However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for being less comprehensive than the ground truth: it omits the deeper insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 (if T5 occurs at all) due to the permanent disabling effect of T3 on the inhibitor arc, and it does not include an extended sequence showing T3 firing afterward (even though the ground truth's extension contains an invalid T4 firing, as p3=0 prevents it). These omissions represent meaningful differences in explanatory depth and completeness, warranting a deduction despite the LLM answer's sufficiency and correctness for the core question.
