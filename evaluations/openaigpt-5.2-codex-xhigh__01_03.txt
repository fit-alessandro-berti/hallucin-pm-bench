9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Overall Fidelity (High)**: LLM correctly identifies exactly the two decision points (no omissions or extras). Document list is **identical** in content, order, and completeness to ground truth (9 items, no hallucinations like KYC/AML).
- **Part (a) Strengths**: Both points accurately capture rules in one sentence each. Role names listed precisely. Logic (Low/Medium + ≤ €250k skip; 2/3 approvals) verbatim from process.
- **Part (a) Deductions (-0.5 total)**:
  - Point 1: Title "Skip‑Manual‑Underwriting rule" ≠ "**Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check**" (-0.2). Adds "(step 5)" (accurate but extraneous vs. GT phrasing) (-0.1). Minor currency format "€250,000" vs. "€250 000" (-0.1). "performed" vs. "proceeds to that review" (slight rephrase, -0.1).
  - Point 2: "reviewers" vs. "approvers" (-0.1). "approve" vs. "record “Approve.”" (-0.0, as process uses "approvals," not quoted term).
- **Part (b) Strengths**: Perfect match in list/order. Header semantically equivalent.
- **Part (b) Deductions (-0.1)**: Header "Documents in order of first appearance" vs. "Required documents (first-appearance order)" (minor wording). Inconsistent bolding (LLM bolds all; GT none).
- **Formatting/Style (-0.2)**: Extra subheader "(one sentence each)"; em-dashes vs. en-dash; minor italics/bolding diffs. Structure close but not pixel-perfect.
- **No Major Errors**: Zero hallucinations, inventions, or misses. Strictness applied: cumulative small phrasing/title/format diffs deduct ~0.8 from 10.0.
