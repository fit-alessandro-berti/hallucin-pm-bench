**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete:

- Q1: Exact match (1 occurrence, correctly identifies C05).
- Q2a/b: Precise calculations (2.08%, 8.33%) with clear sourcing (1/48, 1/12), rounded to two decimals.
- Q3: 78 words; fully addresses criteria—(i) single occurrence (n=1), (ii) variance/instability (no power, extreme variance, over-/under-fit), (iii) over-generalisation risks (wrong conclusions, coincidence vs. pattern, noise vs. effect). Data-grounded example (C05 timing) enhances without inventing. Format clear and concise; no errors or extras.
