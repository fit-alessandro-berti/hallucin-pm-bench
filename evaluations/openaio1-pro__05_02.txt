7.0

The LLM answer proposes to reduce the due date of the "Collect Equipment" task from 5 days to 3 days, whereas the ground truth answer specifies reducing it to 2 days. The format of the diff is correct, and the rationale is clear, concise, and relevant. However, the due date value is off by one day compared to the ground truth, which is a non-trivial error considering SLA sensitivityâ€”such mistakes may lead to non-compliance. This significant but not catastrophic mismatch warrants a substantial penalty. Minimal errors are present aside from the due date value, so the score is 7.0.
