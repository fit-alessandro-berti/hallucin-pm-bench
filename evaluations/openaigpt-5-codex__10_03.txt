3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Positive, ~2 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms exactly as specified ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no synonyms, leaks, or variations. No disallowed terms appear. This is a strong match to the ground truth and policy.
- **Activities Covered (Major Deduction, -4 points)**: The prompt requires covering "every activity" without renaming, merging, or adding. The narrative implies six core activities (vetting, KYC/CDD, AML/sanctions, risk scoring, officer approval/escalation, payment scheduling/release/notification by Treasury). The ground truth standardizes to six rows, merging "schedule/release" into "Release Funds" and omitting "Notify" as non-core. The LLM adds two extraneous rows ("Schedule the Payment", "Notify the Originating Analyst"), treating them as separate, which constitutes unauthorized addition and splitting. It also renames "Release the Funds" slightly differently from ground truth's "Release Funds". This over-expansion violates the "do not add" rule strictly.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction, -3.5 points)**: Assignments diverge significantly across nearly all cells, even for the core four activities:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Misses Compliance Analyst (C) and Treasury (I); uses empty cells instead of explicit "–".
  - **KYC Review**: Incorrectly assigns Front-Office Analyst (I instead of –); misses Officer (C) and Treasury (I).
  - **AML Screening**: Misses Officer (C) and Treasury (I).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Fundamentally wrong—assigns Compliance Analyst (R,A) and Officer (C), but ground truth has Front (C), Compliance (R only, no A), Officer (A only, no R/C), and Treasury (I). This inverts responsibilities and accountability.
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Mostly aligns (e.g., Officer R,A), but adds unnecessary Treasury (I) where ground truth has "–".
  - **Release Funds**: Misses Compliance Analyst (C) and Officer (C); incorrectly lists Compliance Analyst as I instead of C.
  - Extra rows ("Schedule", "Notify") have no ground truth equivalent, introducing unprompted assignments (e.g., widespread "I" that over-involves roles).
  These are not minor; they misrepresent process governance, with ~70% of cells differing (counting empties as "–" mismatches).
- **Format and Presentation (Deduction, -1 point)**: Markdown table is used, but lacks ground truth's bolding for R,A (e.g., **R, A**), uses empty cells instead of "–" for no involvement (per key points), and has inconsistent spacing/alignment. "R, A" is correctly indicated for dual roles, but overall polish is subpar.
- **Overall Strictness**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., missing "–", no bolding) warrant significant loss; here, structural and content errors compound to show incomplete fidelity to the narrative's roles/activities. The answer is partially useful for vocab but fails as a accurate RACI matrix. Baseline 10, deductions total ~6.5 for a strict score.
