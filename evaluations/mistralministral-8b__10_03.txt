### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Positive, but limited weight):** The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", "Sanctions Check", or "risk rating"). This earns partial credit, as it adheres to the strict policy. However, this is only one aspect of the task.
  
- **Activities Covered (Major Deduction):** The prompt requires covering **every activity described** without renaming, merging, or **adding** activities. The ground truth identifies six precise activities: the four core ones plus "Compliance Officer Approval" (for escalation) and "Release Funds" (covering scheduling, release, and notification as a single activity). The LLM adds unauthorized activities ("Escalation for Review", "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification"), fragmenting the process and exceeding the narrative's scope. It also fails to include distinct "Compliance Officer Approval" as in the ground truth. This is a severe violation, resulting in significant point loss (e.g., from a potential 10 to ~4).

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction):** Assignments deviate substantially from the ground truth across all rows, indicating poor interpretation of roles and responsibilities:
  - **Intake Vetting:** LLM assigns Front-Office Analyst as only R (others I); ground truth has R,A for Front-Office, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury Ops, and – for Compliance Officer. Errors in multiple cells.
  - **KYC Review & AML Screening:** LLM has Compliance Analyst as only R (others I); ground truth has R,A for Compliance Analyst, C for Compliance Officer, I for Treasury Ops, and – for Front-Office Analyst. Consistent over-assignment of I where – or C is needed.
  - **Risk Scoring:** LLM has Compliance Analyst as R (others I); ground truth has C for Front-Office, R for Compliance Analyst, A for Compliance Officer, and I for Treasury Ops. Misses key consultations and accountability.
  - Added LLM rows (e.g., "Escalation for Review") have no ground truth equivalent and incorrect logic (e.g., Compliance Officer as A but others all I, ignoring proper C/I/– distributions).
  - Missing ground truth rows (e.g., "Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds") further compounds the incompleteness.
  Even small cell mismatches (e.g., I vs. C or –) warrant strict penalties per instructions, and here they are pervasive, dropping the score further (e.g., to ~3).

- **Formatting and Extras (Minor Deduction):** The LLM uses a clean Markdown table, but adds an unrequested "Explanation" section, which is extraneous. Ground truth uses bolding for activities and cells with R/A, plus "–" for no involvement (LLM uses I inappropriately). No C assignments in LLM output at all, missing a core RACI element. This adds polish but doesn't offset content errors.

- **Overall Strictness:** With utmost strictness, the LLM captures the vocabulary basics but fundamentally misinterprets the process by adding/merging activities incorrectly and botching RACI logic. Alignment to ground truth is ~30-40% (vocabulary + table structure), justifying a low-mid score. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply.
