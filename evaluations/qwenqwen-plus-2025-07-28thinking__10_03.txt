6.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The answer adheres to the required vocabulary policy: only “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, and “Risk Scoring” are used. No synonyms appear.
- Synonyms in the prompt narrative are not repeated in the answer.
- Role names are correct.
- Activities are not merged or renamed (mostly).
- The matrix is output as a Markdown table.

**Major Issues:**
1. **Deviation from Process Granularity – Added & Merged Activities:**
   - The LLM matrix creates the row “Payment Scheduling”, which does not exist as a separate activity in the ground truth. The ground truth only recognizes “Release Funds”.
   - The row “Funds Release & Notification” merges “Release Funds” and “Notification” (the latter is not an independent activity in the ground truth but a subsidiary part of “Release Funds”), while the ground truth uses just “Release Funds”. This is contrary to the instruction not to merge or add activities.

2. **RACI Mislabeling:**
   - “Intake Vetting”: In the LLM answer, Compliance Analyst is only I (should be C), and Treasury Ops is blank (should be I).
   - “KYC Review” and “AML Screening”: Both are missing Consulted (C) assignments for Compliance Officer (should be present in ground truth), and Treasury Ops is blank where it should be I.
   - “Risk Scoring”: Accountable is given to Compliance Analyst (should be Compliance Officer), with Compliance Officer only as I. Front-Office Analyst and Compliance Analyst are missing from C or I roles as required.
   - “Compliance Officer Approval”: Treasury Ops is marked as I (not present in ground truth). Front-Office Analyst and Compliance Analyst are left blank ("–" and C in ground truth), and so is Treasury Ops.
   - “Release Funds”: The row is missing; the activity is merged.
   - “Funds Release & Notification”: Only Treasury Ops appears as R, A, missing C for others as per ground truth, and Treasury Ops is incorrectly assigned R, A for “Funds Release & Notification”, while in the ground truth this is split.

3. **Formatting/Labeling:**
   - The activity “Compliance Officer Approval” is accurate in name but does not match the ground truth’s consulted/informed assignments.
   - The “–” (dash) notation is missing in favor of blank cells.
   - Order of activities does not strictly match the ground truth (though this is secondary to the above errors).

**Summary:**  
While all mandated terms are used correctly and unauthorized synonyms are avoided (a substantial win), the loss of several points is justified by:
- Unacceptable deviation from the required activity list (merging/splitting/adding rows).
- Several incorrect RACI assignments.
- Omission of “–” notation.

For these reasons, the response earns a **6.0**.
