4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
This evaluation is conducted with utmost strictness, penalizing all deviations from the ground truth answer, including differences in activity naming, RACI assignments, involvement indicators (e.g., empty cells vs. dashes "–"), formatting (e.g., absence of bolding on activity names and key R/A entries), and overall structure. The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using exactly the mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks, which preserves some credit. However, it introduces significant errors in interpreting and covering the described activities, RACI assignments, and presentation, leading to a low score.

#### Key Strengths (Minimal, Contributing to Score Above 1.0)
- **Vocabulary Compliance**: All four core activities are named precisely as required, with no disallowed terms (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", "Sanctions Check", or "risk rating") appearing anywhere. This aligns perfectly with the policy and ground truth.
- **Core Structure**: The table is a valid Markdown format, includes all roles from the roster, and covers the four mandated activities without renaming them.
- **R/A Notation**: Uses "R, A" correctly where a role is both Responsible and Accountable, matching the ground truth convention.

#### Major Errors and Penalties (Leading to Large Deductions)
1. **Activity Naming, Merging, and Addition (Severe Deviation, -3.0 Points)**:
   - The prompt instructs to "cover every activity and role described above" without renaming, merging, or adding activities. The narrative implies activities like the core four, escalation/approval, and payment/release/notification by Treasury Ops.
   - Ground truth consolidates the final process step into a single "Release Funds" activity, appropriately merging "schedule the payment" and "releases the funds and notifies" without adding extras.
   - LLM answer violates this by:
     - Adding "Payment Scheduling" as a separate row (not in ground truth; this splits the narrative unnecessarily).
     - Renaming the final step as "Funds Release & Notification" instead of "Release Funds", introducing descriptive phrasing and splitting it from scheduling.
   - This results in 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6, altering the coverage of "every activity" and exceeding the bounds of the narrative. Even small interpretive additions like this warrant significant penalty under strictness rules.

2. **RACI Assignments (Numerous Mismatches, -2.0 Points)**:
   - Assignments differ in multiple cells, showing misinterpretation of responsibilities from the narrative (e.g., who is consulted/informed for each step). Ground truth reflects nuanced involvement (e.g., Consultation "C" for Compliance Officer in screening steps, Accountability "A" shifted to Officer for Risk Scoring).
   - Specific errors:
     - **Intake Vetting**: LLM has Compliance Analyst as "I" (should be "C"); misses Treasury Ops "I"; empty for Compliance Officer (correct as "–").
     - **KYC Review**: Misses Compliance Officer "C" and Treasury Ops "I"; empty for Front-Office Analyst (correct as "–").
     - **AML Screening**: Identical errors to KYC Review (misses "C" and "I").
     - **Risk Scoring**: Major mismatches—Compliance Analyst as "R, A" (should be only "R"); misses Front-Office Analyst "C"; Compliance Officer as "I" (should be "A"); Treasury Ops "I" (correct).
     - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Empty for Front-Office Analyst (should be "I") and Compliance Analyst (should be "C"); Treasury Ops as "I" (should be "–").
     - **Added Rows**: "Payment Scheduling" and "Funds Release & Notification" have no ground truth equivalents, so all assignments (e.g., Treasury Ops "R, A"; Front-Office Analyst "I") are extraneous and incorrect.
   - These are not minor; even one differing assignment per activity is a small error, but cumulative (affecting ~70% of cells) leads to heavy deduction. The narrative's escalation logic (e.g., Officer accountable for high-risk scoring/approval) is mishandled.

3. **Formatting and Presentation (Consistency Errors, -1.0 Points)**:
   - Ground truth uses dashes "–" for no involvement, bolding (** **) on all activity names and key "R, A" entries for emphasis. LLM uses empty cells (inconsistent with "dash (–) marks no involvement" in key points) and no bolding, making it less precise and visually divergent.
   - Table headers and alignment are similar, but the lack of "–" and bolding introduces small but strict-penalty inconsistencies (e.g., empty cells could imply omission rather than explicit non-involvement).
   - No explanatory notes or additions, which is correct, but the overall polish doesn't match.

#### Overall Score Justification
- Base score for vocabulary/structure: 7.0 (strong adherence to core policy).
- Deductions total -3.0, reflecting the critical violation of not adding/splitting activities.
- Further -2.0 for pervasive RACI inaccuracies, as the matrix's purpose is accurate role mapping.
- -1.0 for formatting lapses, per strictness on small errors.
- Final: 4.0. The answer is functional and policy-compliant in terminology but fails as a faithful RACI representation due to interpretive overreach and mismatches, making it unreliable compared to ground truth. A score below 5.0 is warranted for such deviations in a governance context.
