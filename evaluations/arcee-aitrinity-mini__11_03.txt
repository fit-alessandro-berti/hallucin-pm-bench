**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring):
- **Correct activities identified (3/10)**: Matches ground truth's top three (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint high breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s throughput exceeds) and waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Partial credit.
- **Quantification of SLA exceeds (0/10)**: Catastrophic failure. Ground truth uses *throughput* vs. SLA (Legal +300s, Risk +300s, Credit +60s). LLM wrongly mixes *waiting time* into "breaches" (e.g., Risk "180s over" via 480-300; Legal "0s breach" despite 900>600; Credit "under SLA"). Inverts facts (Credit breaches, not under; Legal severely over).
- **Recommendations (3/10)**: Bullets used correctly ("only for recommendations"), one per activity. But not "concrete, data-driven" (invents generic ideas like "workload forecasting" without table grounding; ground truth ties to data-implied specifics like "low-risk bypass," "add analyst"). No projection/impact.
- **Structure & memo format (4/10)**: Memo-like header/subject; ~120 words. Numbered activities ok but deviates (ground truth bold inline metrics). Typo ("Recommmended"); no total cases (4,805 inferred); ignores "ground every sentence in data" by fabricating interpretations (e.g., "latent inefficiencies").
- **Fidelity to prompt/table (0/10 extra)**: Violates "ground in data, no invent" via metric confusion/inaccurate claims. No absent metrics invented, but core misuse tanks score.
- **Overall strictness penalty**: Major factual errors on *key requirements* (quantify breaches, joint criteria) = >50% deduction. Small issues (typo, word count under, header variance) compound to floor score.
