The LLM answer exactly matches the required output: correct pairs (only those two), correct alphabetical order within pairs (C before Q, P before S) and across the list (C-pair before P-pair), one per line, exact format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` with consistent two spaces before and after the em dash (—). Whitespace is consistent with the specified format; the ground truth's extra alignment spaces in the second line are a presentational choice not mandated by the prompt. No content errors, no extra/missing pairs, ignores Process A correctly. Perfect adherence.
