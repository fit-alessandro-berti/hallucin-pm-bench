9.0

The LLM answer correctly lists the only two legitimate parallelizable pairs from Process B, in the correct alphabetical order within each pair and in the output list. It follows the formatting requirements precisely except for a small but real error: the second pair is not space-aligned to match the formatting provided in the ground truth answer (i.e., no extra spaces to line up the columns). While this is a minor cosmetic formatting issue, the prompt asks for "utmost strictness" and for small errors to have a significant impact. Thus, a score reduction is warranted.

Final score: 9.0
