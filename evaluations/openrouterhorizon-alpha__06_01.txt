The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can run in parallel (Create_Documentation & Quality_Check; Procure_Materials & Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both overall and within pairs), and uses the specified one-pair-per-line format without extraneous content or references to Process A. This matches the ground truth content and intent precisely, including the rationale that no other pairs qualify. However, under utmost strictness, the spacing before the em dash (—) in the second pair ("Procure_Materials  — " with only two spaces vs. the ground truth's apparent five spaces for alignment) constitutes a small formatting inconsistency, warranting a 1.0-point deduction.
