The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it concludes "No" for Q1 (despite initial "Yes" flip-flopping into contradiction) and provides a wrong explanation for Q2, missing the key reachable marking {P2, P5} after T1-T2-T7-T4 where T5 fires before T3. Ground truth is "Yes" with exact minimal sequence. No credit for partial reasoning attempts, muddled logic, or word count adherence—total mismatch under strict evaluation.
