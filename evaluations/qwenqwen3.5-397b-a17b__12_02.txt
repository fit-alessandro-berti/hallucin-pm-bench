The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure (bold/standalone "No" followed by justification citing the exact same counterexamples with matching line numbers and case IDs), content (both highlight C003's reversal and C005's lack of Receive_Order), and phrasing precision ("without any preceding Receive_Order" aligns perfectly with "never contains Receive_Order at all" given the fragment's scope). It adheres strictly to the "one paragraph" format without bullets, uses accurate log-specific reasoning, and proves the "always" claim false without extraneous details or errors. No deductions warranted under utmost strictness.
