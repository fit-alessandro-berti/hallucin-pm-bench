7.0

**Justification:**

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three actual decision points, although it separates the high-value branch decision as a distinct point, which is reasonable.
- The branching logic is generally correct, but not described as explicitly or precisely as in the ground truth answerâ€”for example, the possible outcome of claim rejection is not mentioned for ineligibility or disapproval at the pre-approval/audit stage.
- The decision at the final step (i.e., explicit rejection after Finance_Controller_PreApprove or Senior_Auditor_Review) is not clearly delineated.
- In the list of required documents, the answer includes: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, starts to mention EligibilityChecklist (but truncates here), missing: AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF.
- The required documents list is incomplete (only partially included and appears truncated).
- Importantly, the answer does not introduce non-existent activities or artifacts, which is good.
- Small but significant points lost for:
  - Failure to list all required documents in full (substantial penalty).
  - Slightly imprecise mapping of rejection outcomes at the three decision points.
- Overall, the answer is on the right track and avoids fundamental mistakes, but there are both completeness and precision issues that merit a significant point deduction.
