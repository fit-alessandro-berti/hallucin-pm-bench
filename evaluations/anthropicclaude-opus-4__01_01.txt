### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Partial Match, ~60% Alignment)**: The LLM correctly identifies the eligibility check in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility (#1 matches ground truth's #1) and the high-value amount threshold branch after Finance_Controller_PreApprove (#3 matches ground truth's #2). However, it incorrectly treats Finance_Controller_PreApprove as a standalone decision point (#2 in LLM), which ground truth integrates into the final approval (#3). It also adds an extraneous fourth decision point for Senior_Auditor_Review, implying a separate approval decision, whereas ground truth folds this into the amount threshold (#2) and final approval (#3) without isolating it. No explicit mention of rejection outcomes (e.g., "claim rejected" or "process ends without payment") as in ground truth, reducing precision. This introduces unsubstantiated separations and omits branching outcomes, warranting a ~4-point deduction from max.
  
- **Required Documents (Major Deficiency, ~30% Alignment)**: Lists only 4 items (3 complete + 1 truncated at "Eligibil" for EligibilityChecklist), missing AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, and RefundConfirmationPDF entirely. Ground truth requires a complete catalogue of all 7 defined artefacts, noting AuditTrail's conditional use but inclusion in the list. No disclaimer about no other documents/legacy activities, as required. Truncation and incompleteness are severe errors, deducting ~6 points.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: Response format is somewhat organized (headings, numbering) but lacks ground truth's tabular precision for decisions and exhaustive, numbered completeness for documents. No introduction of undefined elements, which is positive, but strict adherence to the prompt demands exact coverage without additions/omissionsâ€”net score reflects substantial gaps despite partial accuracy.
