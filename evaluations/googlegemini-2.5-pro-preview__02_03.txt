- The LLM answer is almost perfect in content and ordering.
- Minor errors:
    - The answers do not explicitly reference the question numbers.
    - The answer for question 1 is just "3" (not "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"), so it omits the expected explicit list of case names and the word "cases." The question specifically asked for "distinct cases (unique values...)" so the full list is justified in the ground truth.
- All other content matches exactly.
- Strict loss of 1 point for missing these explicit details and for not matching the concise style requested.
