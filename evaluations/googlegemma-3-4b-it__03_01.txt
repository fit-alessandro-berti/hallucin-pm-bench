1.0

The LLM answer produces invalid BPMN 2.0 XML (no `<sequenceFlow>` elements; misuse of `<incoming>`/`<outgoing>` inside tasks/gateways, which is non-standard and breaks connectivity). It fabricates elements (e.g., `<dataMapReference>`, `<dataMapping>`, "loopBackDiagnosis" task, "closeTicket" task) and unnecessary namespaces (e.g., `bpmndi`, `omgdc`). Flows are incorrect: "Provide Reset Instructions" incorrectly routes to the post-diagnosis gateway (`gw2`) instead of directly to "Confirm with Customer"; "Forward to Specialist" skips a post-specialist "Resolve Issue" activity before confirmation (violating line 6); the loop incorrectly targets `t4` (pre-`gw2`) via an invented task, not directly to "Initial Diagnosis" (line 9); "Password Reset" path doesn't bypass diagnosis properly. No conditions on flows (unlike ground truth). Added a third gateway name/description not precisely matching. Extra "closeTicket" task before end (ground truth ends directly). ID inconsistencies (e.g., undefined `t1`, `t4`). These are fundamental errors, not minor, warranting minimal score under strict criteria.
