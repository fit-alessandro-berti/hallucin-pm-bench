The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying the non-compliance due to Rule 3 and properly assessing all rules with correct justifications. However, under utmost strictness: (1) it omits explicit reference to the "severity = High" condition in Rule 2's justification (a small but notable gap compared to ground truth); (2) the format uses bullet points instead of a table, diverging from the ground truth structure; (3) minor wording variances (e.g., "occurs once before RA" vs. "appears once and precedes RA"; no ✔/❌ symbols) introduce subtle differences. These warrant a deduction from a perfect score, but the core logic and brevity align closely.
