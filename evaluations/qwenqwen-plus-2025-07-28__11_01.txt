The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h p95; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quotes metrics verbatim, stays under 150 words, and avoids prohibited content. Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues, and specify â‰¥20% reductions, with a data-driven claim (historical modeling). Minor deductions for action wording/format differences from ground truth (e.g., simpler automation phrasing without "pilot tests" or "rules-engine" specifics; added memo header and closing sentence not in ground truth), but these do not undermine core fidelity or relevance.
