### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Perfectly identifies and ranks top 3 by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4)—verbatim matches table and GT. Quotes both metrics exactly. ≤150 words (147). No service-time, throughput, or extra activities. Actions concrete, logically tied to waiting causes (e.g., reminders for customer delays, automation for workflows), each explicitly targets ≥20% cut with calculated avgs.
- **Differences from GT (point deductions)**: 
  - Actions fully differ (e.g., LLM: "daily reminders" vs GT "24h escalation"; "automate letter" vs "e-signature on closure"; "AI tools" vs "rules-engine bypass")—major content variance (-0.4).
  - Format: Full memo (subject/to/from) vs GT's bare list (+ polish, but differs -0.1).
  - Extra content: Root causes, ROI, goals (-0.2; unwarranted fluff, though ≤150).
  - Minor slips: #3 says "processing time" (hints service, violates no-service spirit; should be waiting -0.1). Precise invented targets (29.2h etc.) unsupported vs GT's vaguer % (-0.1). No "data-driven" phrasing like GT's "pilot tests"/"estimated" (-0.0, both invent).
- **Per scoring notes**: Correctness ✓, no unwarranted metrics ✓, actions relevant/logical ✓ (≥20% promised).
Strict total: Excellent (92%) but penalized for variances/slips.
