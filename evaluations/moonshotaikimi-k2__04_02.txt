3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Incorrect status (Violated vs. Compliant) and flawed justification (ignores that initial approvals satisfy R1 despite change; also exceeds 20-word limit at ~25 words). Major error: -2.0 points.
- **R2**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and incomplete justification (fails to account for new approval on 07-Mar as the "last required approval" post-change, making Ship_Goods non-compliant). Major error: -2.0 points.
- **R3**: Correct status and justification (dates accurate, under 20 words). No deduction.
- **R4**: Correct status and justification (under 20 words). No deduction.
- **R5**: Correct status; justification similar but slightly less precise (omits Pay_Invoice explicitly, though implied). Minor error: -0.5 points.
- **R6**: Correct status and justification (under 20 words). No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by rule errors. Format mostly follows prompt (text list acceptable, though ground truth uses table).

Base score: 10.0. Deductions total -4.5 for errors, yielding 5.5; further -2.0 for strictness on two core rule violations and justification length exceedance, adjusted to 3.5.
