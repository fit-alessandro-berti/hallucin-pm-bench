6.0

Rationale:

- R1: Incorrectly marked as Violated. The ground truth clearly says Compliant, as initial Manager then Finance approvals exist for >€10k. The LLM answer introduces a misinterpretation regarding approval sequence after the change request, which is R5, not R1. Major error.
- R2: Incorrectly marked as Compliant. The ground truth says Violated: expedited PO requires Ship_Goods within 2 days of the last required approval—which is after the post-change Manager Approval, not the original approvals. Ship_Goods occurred before this new approval, violating the rule. Major error.
- R3: Correct. Marked as Violated both in LLM and ground truth, with a clear, accurate justification.
- R4: Correct. Not Applicable, matching the trace and ground truth.
- R5: Correct. Marked as Violated with justification similar to ground truth.
- R6: Correct. Marked as Compliant, matches the ground truth.

Conclusion: The LLM answer got 4 out of 6 rules correct, but both errors (R1 and R2) are severe, misinterpreting key parts of approval sequence rules, affecting core compliance analysis. Significant point loss per your strict criteria. The conclusion of NON-COMPLIANT is correct, but largely by chance, as the justifications for R1 and R2 are not in line with process logic.

Stylistically, the answer is otherwise well-structured.  
Final strict score: 6.0
