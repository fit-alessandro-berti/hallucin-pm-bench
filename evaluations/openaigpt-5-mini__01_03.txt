6.0

a) The LLM correctly identifies the two main decision points specified in the process (“risk-based skip” and “TriVote” approval), though its wording could be clearer and more concise. However, it incorrectly adds a third decision point: “Applicant confirmation before finalization.” This is not presented as a gate or conditional branch in the process, but as a procedural step (finalization happens after required documents are returned). This overstates the number of decision gates, misrepresenting the process logic.

b) The document list is correct in content (order and names match the ground truth), but inclusion of “Scorecard–Cyan,” “–Magenta,” and “–Yellow” is slightly ambiguous; however, their explicit inclusion reflects the process input and matches the ground truth. No hallucinations present.

The unnecessary extra decision point and less-than-optimal explanation costs a significant portion of the score, given the instruction for strictness. The document list is essentially correct, so the majority of points are preserved.
