5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
**Part (a) Assessment (major deductions applied):**  
The LLM correctly identifies the first two decision points but introduces significant errors through added extraneous details and an invented third point. Strict evaluation penalizes these as follows:  
- First point: Includes unnecessary description of how the risk rating is produced (scorecards producing the rating), which conflates the Tri-Color-Risk-Check step with the actual conditional branch/skip decision. The ground truth focuses solely on the "if" rule post-check. This is a minor but clear deviation (-1.0 point). Titling it "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" instead of emphasizing the "risk-based skip after" further misaligns with the ground truth's framing (-0.5 points).  
- Second point: Adds non-essential details about mandatory participation ("must all participate (Sustainability Officer participation is mandatory)"), which is background from the process note but not part of the core "decision rule" (approvals). The ground truth concisely states only the approval threshold. This extraneous inclusion is a small error but incurs significant penalty per instructions (-1.0 point). The phrasing is otherwise accurate.  
- Third point: Entirely hallucinates an additional "decision point" (applicant confirmation as a gate/branch), which is not described as such in the process or ground truth. Step 8 is a sequential request, not a conditional branch or gate like the explicit "if" or "TriVote." Identifying a non-existent decision point is a major error, inflating the count from 2 to 3 (-3.0 points).  
Overall for (a): Starts at 10.0 potential but deducts to 4.5/10 after strict penalties for deviations, extras, and invention.

**Part (b) Assessment:**  
Identical to ground truth in content, order, and completenessâ€”no additions (e.g., no hallucinated KYC/AML docs), no omissions. Perfect match (10/10).

**Overall Score Calculation:**  
Weighted average (assuming equal parts): (4.5 + 10) / 2 = 7.25, but strictness for part (a)'s structural errors (wrong count of points) reduces further to 5.0 to reflect the "significant loss" for even small cumulative issues, as instructed. The response is helpful and non-hallucinatory on docs but fails to precisely mirror the ground truth's concise, accurate identification of *exactly* the decision points.
