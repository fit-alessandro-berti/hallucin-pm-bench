### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two core decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate) but erroneously includes the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a third "decision point." This is not a gate or conditional branch per the prompt—it is merely a step that generates an input for the actual conditional branch. The descriptions of the true decision points are mostly accurate but slightly less precise than the ground truth (e.g., TriVote phrasing omits the explicit "record 'Approve'" detail and simplifies the rule without matching the ground truth's wording exactly). This introduces a structural error and minor phrasing differences, warranting a significant deduction for strictness.
- **Part (b)**: Identical to the ground truth in content, order, and completeness—no hallucinations or omissions. Full marks here.
- **Overall**: Strong on (b) but flawed on (a) due to the extraneous decision point and subtle inaccuracies, leading to a moderate score. No policy violations or unrelated issues.
