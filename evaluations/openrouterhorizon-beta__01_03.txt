7.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision Points:**

- The LLM answer incorrectly lists the *Tri-Color-Risk-Check* step itself as a decision point; it is merely an evaluation, not a gate. Only the *skip-or-not* decision after the check is a true decision point.
- The answer merges the "conditional branch after risk check" with the process skip correctly, but its first bullet is not a gate.
- The description for the TriVote gate is acceptably accurate, succinct, and in line with the ground truth.
- The LLM omits the “gate-like” nature of the Manual-Underwriting-Review step—i.e., it’s only present for High risk or large amounts, which is the true branching point.
- The answer provides three items instead of the two, making the structure and precision inferior to the ground truth.

**b) Documents:**

- Itemization and ordering of documents is **fully correct**.
- No hallucinated documents are present.

**Summary:**  
The answer is factually sound for part (b), but there is extra/unnecessary information in part (a), slightly misrepresents where the decision points actually occur, and lacks the strict minimalism/precision of the ground truth (too many points listed, with the first not really being a decision point). For these reasons, a 3-point deduction is warranted for structural imprecision and a minor loss for overly broad gate listing, resulting in a **7.0**.
