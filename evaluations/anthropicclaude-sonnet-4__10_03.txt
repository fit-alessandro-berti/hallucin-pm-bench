### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms exactly as specified ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without any synonyms or leaks. The output is a valid Markdown table structure covering all roles. It identifies the core process flow without renaming the mandated activities.
- **Major weaknesses (significant deductions)**: 
  - Added unauthorized activities ("Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification") in violation of "do not ... add activities", splitting what the ground truth merges into "Release Funds" and omitting or folding in notification. This introduces 3 extraneous rows, bloating the matrix beyond the described process.
  - Extensive mismatches in RACI assignments, even for core activities (e.g., Intake Vetting: Compliance Analyst as I vs. C, Compliance Officer as I vs. –; KYC Review/AML Screening: Front-Office Analyst as I vs. –, Compliance Officer as I vs. C; Risk Scoring: Front-Office as I vs. C, Compliance Analyst as R/A vs. R, Compliance Officer as C vs. A; Approval: Treasury Ops as I vs. –). These are not minor; they misrepresent responsibilities across nearly all cells.
  - Formatting inconsistencies: Uses slashes (R/A) instead of commas (R, A); no bolding on RACI designations as in ground truth; includes involvement (e.g., I) where ground truth uses dashes (–) for no involvement; no dashes at all.
  - Fails to "cover every activity" precisely without addition/merging, resulting in incomplete fidelity to the narrative (e.g., no separate "Compliance Officer Approval" involvement distinctions; ignores consultations for "Release Funds").
- **Overall**: Strict scoring penalizes additions and RACI errors heavily (each mismatch ~0.5-1.0 point loss per activity). The output is recognizable but fundamentally inaccurate, warranting a low-mid score.
