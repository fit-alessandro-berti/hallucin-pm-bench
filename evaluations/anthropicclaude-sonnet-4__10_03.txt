4.5

The LLM answer makes an effort to comply with the strict vocabulary policy and produces a Markdown table. However, there are several substantial errors and deviations from the ground truth:

**Major Issues:**
1. **Extra Activities Incorrectly Added:**
   - The LLM answer contains “Payment Scheduling” and “Notification” as activities, which are not prescribed in the ground truth, nor are they authorized as standalone activities under the process narrative or vocabulary policy.
   - It splits “Funds Release” into two activities: “Funds Release” and “Notification”.

2. **Missing Activity:**
   - The ground truth’s “Release Funds” activity is split in the LLM output, but not as a single row. This introduces confusion, as activities should not be merged or split, according to instructions.

3. **Incorrect RACI Assignments:**
   - “Intake Vetting”: The ground truth correctly marks Front-Office Analyst as both Responsible and Accountable (“R, A”), Compliance Analyst as Consulted (C), Treasury Ops as Informed (I), Compliance Officer as not involved (–). Instead, the LLM puts the role as “R/A” (acceptable shorthand) and everyone else as “I”.
   - For several activities, the LLM marks both Responsible and Accountable (“R/A”) always in the same role, automatically, and leaves others only as “I”, missing instances where other roles are Consulted (C) or not involved (–).
   - “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”: Marked “R/A” only for Compliance Analyst, others “I”. Ground truth includes Compliance Officer as C and “–” where applicable.
   - “Risk Scoring”: Ground truth distinguishes Responsible (Compliance Analyst) and Accountable (Compliance Officer), but LLM assigns “R/A” to Compliance Analyst, and marks Compliance Officer as Consulted (“C”).
   - “Compliance Officer Approval” (LLM’s wording): LLM claims Compliance Officer is both “R/A”, but the others are “I” or “C”, omitting correct “–” for Treasury Ops.
   - “Funds Release”: LLM marks only Treasury Ops as responsible/accountable, others as “I”; ground truth marks Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer as “C”.

4. **Minor Format Issues:**
   - Does not use dash (–) for cases with no involvement, instead uses “I” everywhere else.
   - In several cases, turns roles that should be “C” or “–” into “I”.
   - The temporal order (“Notification” after “Funds Release”) is not part of the prescribed activities.

**Vocabulary Policy Adherence:**
- The LLM uses the required terms for the four activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) and does not output forbidden synonyms. This is about the only strong point and saves the answer from an extremely low score.

**Conclusion:**
- The LLM answer shows effort, and strictly avoids forbidden vocabulary, but deviates greatly in activity list, RACI assignments, and formatting per ground truth.
- Partial adherence to the vocabulary and some RACI logic justifies a score higher than minimal, but the structurally incorrect matrix and role assignments result in a significant deduction.

**Hence, the rigorous score: 4.5**
