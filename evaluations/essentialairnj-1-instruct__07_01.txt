The LLM answer fails catastrophically on all criteria: it produces irrelevant, incomplete Python code instead of the required textual summary under exact headings ("• Added tasks", "• Removed tasks", "• Gateway type changes"). No factual differences are listed, no element IDs or names are used correctly, no "(none)" for empty categories, and it redundantly embeds XML while ignoring instructions to analyze provided snippets directly. Zero alignment with ground truth content, format, or structure.
