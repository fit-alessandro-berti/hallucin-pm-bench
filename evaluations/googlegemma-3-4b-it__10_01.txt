5.0

**Rationale:**

**1. Strict Vocabulary Adherence:**  
The LLM correctly uses the required terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"), and nowhere does it mention the forbidden terms or alternatives. **No deduction here.**

**2. Matrix Structure and Completeness:**  
- The format is generally fine: correct columns, activities, and rolesâ€”good adherence.  
- No extra or missing activities or roles. **No deduction here.**

**3. RACI Allocations/Accuracy:**  
- **Major Error:** The LLM matrix gives only a single "R" per activity (e.g., the Account Manager for "Order Vetting", Compliance Officer for "KYC Review" etc.), but does NOT include "A" (Accountable) anywhere.  
- The ground truth specifies "R/A" for key activities (i.e., Account Manager is both Responsible and Accountable on Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer), as well as Accountable (A) for others; also includes "C" and "I" for the rest of the roles per activity.
- The LLM answer omits all "A", "C", and "I" assignments entirely.  
- **This is a significant structural and content error:** a RACI matrix requires, at minimum, both R and A to be shown; omitting A's and all non-R assignments is a primary error.

**4. Explanatory Content:**  
- The LLM defines the RACI letters, but then does not actually use "A", "C", or "I" in the table as needed.  
- The explanation and the table are inconsistent.  
- "Let me know if you'd like any adjustments..." is unnecessary but not penalized for this context.

**5. Strictness Factors:**  
Per instruction, even small errors result in significant deductions. Here, the error is not small: a core requirement of the RACI matrix was missed (multiple roles per activity, especially "Accountable"). That is a fundamental miss for process-mapping.

**Summary of Deductions:**  
- -2 for missing all "A" allocations  
- -2 for missing all "C" and "I" allocations  
- -1 for inconsistency between matrix and definitions  

**Thus: 5.0.**  
The answer gets partial credit for the correct vocabulary, correct activities and roles, and format, but fails in RACI allocation depth, which is central to the exercise.
