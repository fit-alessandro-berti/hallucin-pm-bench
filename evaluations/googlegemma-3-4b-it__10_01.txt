4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Adherence (Strength, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. However, it fails to bold them as in the ground truth, which is a minor formatting inconsistency but deducts slightly under strictness.
  
- **Matrix Structure (Partial, +1.5 points)**: Basic RACI table format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns (using abbreviations, unlike ground truth's full names). No extra tasks, roles, or columns added, aligning with the rubric. However, headers use abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), differing from ground truth's plain full names, and the table lacks bolding/formatting for key activities.

- **RACI Allocations (Major Weakness, -4.0 points)**: This is the core failure. The LLM assigns only **R** to one role per activity based on the explicit process description (e.g., AM as R for Receive Application), reflecting the narrative's "handled by/performed by" phrasing and ensuring one Responsible per row. This is partially correct but severely incomplete:
  - No **A** (Accountable) assignments, despite ground truth designating AM as A (often combined as R/A) for most activities to reflect overall oversight.
  - No **C** (Consulted) or **I** (Informed) assignments; all non-R cells are blank (implying no involvement), while ground truth fully populates them (e.g., CO as C for Order Vetting, FC as I for Receive Application).
  - Ground truth infers logical involvements (e.g., CO consulted on vetting/payment for compliance), which the LLM ignores, leading to ~80% cell-level differences. Even small omissions like missing R/A combinations count as significant errors under strict evaluation.

- **Additional Content (Minor Weakness, -0.5 points)**: Includes an unnecessary "Key" explanation (RACI definitions) and "Notes" section recapping assignments, plus an offer for "adjustments," which introduces unwarranted elaboration not present in the ground truth. No self-awareness issues, but this bloats the response beyond a pure matrix.

- **Overall Correctness and Fidelity (Low, base score adjusted to 4.5)**: While the LLM adheres to the process narrative minimally and avoids errors like extra elements, the matrix is a skeletal version that misses the ground truth's comprehensive RACI logic (e.g., accountability chain, consultations). Under utmost strictness, these omissions—especially unfilled cells and lack of A/C/I—represent critical deviations, warranting a low-mid score. A perfect match would require identical assignments and minimalism.
