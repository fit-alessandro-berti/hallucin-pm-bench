7.5

The LLM answer:

- Correctly identifies both parallel pairs.
- Orders the pairs alphabetically in the output list.
- The pairs are formatted per instructions except for one small but strict error: **the required format was**  
  `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (with two spaces between task names and the em dash),  
  **but the LLM output used only single spaces:**  
  - `Create_Documentation — Quality_Check`  
  - `Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines`  
  (i.e., it uses single spaces before and after the em dash, not two).

This is a clear formatting deviation as the ground truth uses exactly two spaces before and after the em dash. As per the evaluation instructions, even small errors must lead to a significant loss of points.

**Therefore: -2.5 points** for not strictly adhering to formatting, giving a final score of **7.5**.
