The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel, with no factual errors or inclusion of irrelevant tasks from Process A. The pairs are listed in the required alphabetical order both within each pair and overall. However, it includes an unnecessary explanatory preamble and rationale text before the list, which deviates from the prompt's instruction to "Output one pair per line" (implying a clean list without additional commentary). Additionally, the output uses backticks around each line and lacks the precise spacing/alignment seen in the ground truth (e.g., no padding spaces in the second pair to align the em dash). These formatting and structural deviations warrant a minor deduction under strict evaluation criteria, but the core content is highly accurate.
