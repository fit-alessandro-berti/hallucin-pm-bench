**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses exactly the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no leaks or synonyms. However, adds unauthorized activity names (e.g., "Approval (if score > 70)", "Payment Scheduling") violating "do not rename, merge, or add activities."
- **Activities (-3.0)**: Adds 4 extra/renamed activities not matching ground truth (GT has precisely 6: the 4 mandated + "Compliance Officer Approval" + "Release Funds"). Splits/renames narrative elements incorrectly (e.g., no "Payment Scheduling" or separate "Notification"; combines differently in GT).
- **RACI assignments (-3.0)**: Fundamentally incorrect across **all** activities vs. GT:
  | Activity (LLM) | LLM | GT | Match? |
  |----------------|-----|----|--------|
  | Intake Vetting | Front R only | Front **R,A**; CompA C; Tr I | No (misses A/C/I) |
  | KYC Review | CompA R | CompA **R,A**; CompO C; Tr I | No |
  | AML Screening | CompA R | CompA **R,A**; CompO C; Tr I | No |
  | Risk Scoring | CompA R | Front C; CompA R; CompO **A**; Tr I | No |
  | Others | All wrong/new | N/A | No |
  - Ignores widespread C/I involvements; no "R,A" combos; blanks ≠ GT's "–".
- **Formatting/Structure (-0.5)**: Markdown table OK, but adds intro text, "Key" legend (GT has none), no bolding, inconsistent cells (blanks vs. "–"), "(if score > 70)" leaks process detail.
- **Coverage (-0.5)**: Misses nuanced escalations/consults/informs; doesn't cover "every activity and role" as interpreted in GT.
- **Total**: Major deviations in content/core matrix justify low score; minor vocab win prevents 1.0.
