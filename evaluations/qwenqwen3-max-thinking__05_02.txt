**1.0**

The LLM answer proposes an entirely different change (altering `targetRef` of `Flow_3` to bypass tasks, orphaning `Task_SignContract` and `Task_CollectEquipment` in the flow) with a mismatched rationale, violating the expectation of matching the ground truth's precise attribute modification (changing `camunda:dueDate` on `Task_CollectEquipment` from `P5D` to `P2D`) and its SLA-specific reasoning; even the diff format deviates substantially from the ground truth's structure, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
