The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. However, it violates the prompt's strict instruction against adding activities by introducing four unauthorized new ones (Approval, Payment Scheduling, Releasing Funds, Notification), renaming/conditioning them (e.g., with score thresholds), and splitting the process in ways not aligned with the narrative or ground truth. This merges, adds, and deviates from the core four while failing to cover implied activities precisely as in the ground truth (e.g., no separate "Compliance Officer Approval"; omits low-risk path integration into "Release Funds"; adds extraneous "Notification" row).

RACI assignments show major inaccuracies and incompleteness compared to ground truth: 
- Misses multiple roles per activity (e.g., Intake Vetting lacks A for Front-Office, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury Ops; Risk Scoring lacks A for Compliance Officer and C for Front-Office).
- Incorrect or oversimplified designations (e.g., Compliance Analyst as sole R for KYC/AML without A; no C roles for Compliance Officer in early steps; invents I for Treasury Ops in Approval).
- Non-standard notations (e.g., A/R, R/A, R/I; blanks instead of â€“; no bolding for emphasis).
- Adds unrequested explanation section, which introduces potential for disallowed phrasings (though none leak) and exceeds the "Markdown table only" output requirement.

These structural, content, and formatting deviations result in low fidelity to both prompt constraints and ground truth, warranting severe deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
