4.0

The LLM answer displays some serious deviations from both the vocabulary policy and the process mapping required, as compared to the ground truth:

- **Vocabulary Compliance**: The LLM answer correctly uses the four required activity names in the table and does not output synonyms for those activities. However, its "Approval (score > 70)" and "Payment Scheduling (score <= 70)" are unauthorized rewordings/merging not present in the ground truth, instead of listing “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”.
  - The prompt explicitly states not to merge, rename, or add activities. The LLM disregards this (it merges “Approval” and “Payment Scheduling” with conditional logic, and introduces a catch-all “Notification” at the end).
- **Structure & Activity Coverage**: The matrix structure fails to list all the activities as discrete items from the process narrative.
  - “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”, “Compliance Officer Approval”, and “Release Funds” should be the activities. This matrix instead merges “Approval” with embedded process logic, splits “Releasing Funds” and “Payment Scheduling”, and adds “Notification” (which is unsupported by the narrative).
- **RACI Assignment Errors**:
  - The ground truth assigns “R, A” to single roles for Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, and Release Funds, with explicit 'C', 'I', and ‘–’ roles for all activities. The LLM answer uses only one role per activity as Responsible (no dual “R, A”), and generally omits “A” from most activities. For instance:
    - “Intake Vetting”: LLM assigns only "R" to Front-Office Analyst, not "R, A", and omits others.
    - “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”: Only "R" to Compliance Analyst, not "R, A", with no 'C' or 'I'.
    - “Risk Scoring”: Assigns only "R" to Compliance Analyst; the ground truth has "R" and "A" to separate parties, and Front-Office Analyst as "C".
  - “Compliance Officer Approval” is not explicitly broken out; it’s merged as “Approval (score > 70)”, and the involved roles do not have the correct RACI mapping.
  - “Release Funds” is split as “Payment Scheduling” and “Releasing Funds”, which is not strictly process-compliant per the narrative nor the ground truth.
- **Notation and Formatting**:
  - The ground truth uses "R, A" when one person is both Responsible and Accountable, and uses '–' for no involvement, neither of which is reflected in the LLM answer.

**Conclusion:**  
While the LLM answer avoids the forbidden synonyms for the four mandated terms (hence not a failing grade), it falls short in fidelity to the *activity list, explicit RACI mapping, naming constraints, and structure*, which are severe process and policy breaches given the very rigid instructions. Each activity and RACI mapping divergence imposes a significant penalty. Therefore, a **4.0** is appropriate—showing basic awareness of vocabulary, but serious failures in compliance and accuracy.
