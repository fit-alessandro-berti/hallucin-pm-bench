**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies **yes** with a valid shortest firing sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) demonstrating T5 fires without T3 having fired (length 4, matching GT's acknowledged lower bound), includes accurate step-by-step marking verification, and notes the shortcut role of T2b. However, strict comparison reveals significant differences from ground truth: (1) shorter sequence omitting T6/T3 (GT provides full 6-step sequence explicitly showing T3 firing *after* T5); (2) LLM explicitly states "T3 never fires" (potentially underemphasizing post-T5 possibility via feedback, unlike GT's explicit demonstration and explanation); (3) lacks GT's "Why this works" section, inline markings per step, lower-bound argument, and claim of minimality for the full ordering proof; (4) less formal structure/proof depth. These omissions and mismatches deduct points despite no factual errors (-2.0 for sequence/format difference, -1.0 for missing extended demo/explanation).
