3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Major error. LLM incorrectly states 2 occurrences (even fabricating a duplicate log entry for A1002), while ground truth is 1. This is a clear hallucination, violating the "do not infer" rule. (-3.0 points from max)
- **Question 2**: Direct consequence of Q1 error; calculates 11.11% instead of 5.56%. Precise rounding is correct in method but input is wrong. (-2.5 points)
- **Question 3**: Matches ground truth exactly (only A1002). (+2.5 points)
- **Question 4**: First reason ("small dataset") aligns with ground truth's "small sample size." Second reason ("lack of patterns/regularity" with clustering inference) deviates by introducing unsubstantiated assumptions about sequences and monthly patterns, not directly derivable from logs; doesn't match any ideal reasons like temporal/case-mix bias. Partial credit. (+0.0 net, as one good + one poor = neutral but strict penalty for inference)

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts for factual inaccuracy and deviation (resulting in 3.0). The core counting hallucination alone warrants severe deduction under strict criteria.
