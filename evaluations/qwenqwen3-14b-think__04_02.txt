6.0

- **R1: Correct.** Status and justification match the ground truth.
- **R2: Incorrect.** LLM judged "Compliant" just comparing Ship_Goods to first Finance_Approval. It failed to recognize that a new Manager_Approval after a Change_Request starts a new approval sequence, so the Ship_Goods action was not within 2 days of the final approval. This is a significant conceptual error, as the sequence of approvals must be restarted.  
- **R3: Correct.** Status and justification match.
- **R4: Correct.** Status and justification match.
- **R5: Partially correct, but incomplete justification.** Status ("Violated") is correct, and the core issue is captured, but the justification did not specifically mention Pay_Invoice, which is also a "further processing step" after the change. The omission is a minor, but relevant error.
- **R6: Correct.** Status and justification match.

**Format:** Overall structure and result match the required format.

**Severity of errors:** The R2 error is critical as it misunderstands a nontrivial rule dependency. The R5 justification is not fully comprehensive, missing a required detail. Given the requirement of "utmost strictness" and for even small errors to cause a significant point loss, these issues lead to a substantial reduction in score.

**Final score: 6.0/10**
