7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency):
- **Format and Structure**: Matches prompt closely (status + short justification per rule, overall in all-caps). No table needed, so minor deduction for not exactly mimicking ground truth's table (0.5 points lost).
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification accurate but omits explicit "then" sequence (minor; rule implies order, trace shows it) – small loss (0.25 points).
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. ground truth Violated) – major error, misses impact of post-change approval on "last required approval" timing. Justification fully wrong – significant deduction (2.5 points lost).
- **R3**: Status and justification match exactly – full credit.
- **R4**: Status and justification match closely (minor wording diff: "Hazardous = false" vs. "hazardous = false") – full credit.
- **R5**: Status correct (Violated). Justification valid but incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice as further processing; ground truth includes it) – moderate loss (0.5 points).
- **R6**: Status and justification match – full credit.
- **Overall Result**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT) – full credit.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, R2 error (core misanalysis of rule/trace) warrants heavy penalty; minor phrasing issues add small losses. Base 10, total deductions ~2.75 points.
