9.5

The LLM's answer is almost perfect: it correctly identifies every change under the exactly requested headings and ignores cosmetic renamings. It:

- Correctly lists all three added tasks, using both id and label.
- Correctly lists the one removed task, with both id and label.
- Accurately describes the gateway-type change (“exclusive” to “inclusive”) and the specific gateway affected, noting the name update as cosmetic.

**Minor issue(s):**
- The LLM answer repeats the ground truth’s recognition that `Task_ApproveLoan`'s renaming is cosmetic, but the LLM calls out the new label “Auto-Approve Loan” in a paranthetical. The ground truth omits mention of this renaming entirely.
- The order and phrasing are slightly different: the ground truth always places the label first, then id in parenthesis; the LLM does id then label in parenthesis. Both show both, but this is a very minor mismatch.

Given the scoring instructions to be extremely strict and penalize even small errors, this tiny difference in format and unnecessary mention of the cosmetic change warrants a slight deduction.

**Final Grade:** 9.5
