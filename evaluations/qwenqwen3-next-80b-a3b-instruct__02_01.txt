6.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth on Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, Q5 is significantly incorrect: "Receive_Order" and "Quality_Check" are present in the answer, though they are clearly first events in cases and should NOT be listed. As per instructions, small errors must lead to significant point deductions, and Q5 is quite important (list question, and the answer is longer and shows a lack of careful filtering).

Each of Q1â€“Q4: exact match (1.5 points each = 6.0).  
Q5: contains three incorrect values (including the two first-event activities, which should have been strictly excluded), and the correct item count is also incorrect (lists too many, so minus 4.0 points).

Score: 6.0
