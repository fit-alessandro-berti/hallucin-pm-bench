5.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 (no differences, full credit there). However, Q5 has significant errors: it incorrectly includes "Receive_Order" and "Quality_Check" (both appear as first events in cases), while omitting nothing but bloating the list with two invalid items. This is a major factual deviation per the prompt's rules (only use facts from the log), warranting a 50% deduction for that section. Overall, with four perfect questions and one substantially flawed, the score reflects partial accuracy but strict penalties for the errors in Q5.
