9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks (the two parallel constructs), lists the task names as per the process flow, and numbers them in the order they appear. The answer avoids referencing Processes A or C, as requested.

However, there are minor formatting and specificity differences compared to the ground truth:
- The LLM answer does not explicitly label them as "Set 1 – first parallel block" / "Set 2 – second parallel block" and omits additional clarifying comments such as "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel."
- The LLM uses a dash-list formatting instead of explicitly showing the parallelism as `Task1` ‖ `Task2`.
- There is a slight lack of alignment with the precise wording and clarity of the ground truth.

These small but notable deviations in phrasing and completeness merit a deduction. Thus, the answer gets a 9.0.
