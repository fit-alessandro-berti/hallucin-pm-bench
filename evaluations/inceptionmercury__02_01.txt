6.0

The LLM answer is correct for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, fully matching the ground truth for those questions. However, for Q5, the answer is incomplete and contains errors:

- The LLM answer for Q5 is ["Quality_Check", "Ship_Order"].
- The correct (ground-truth) answer is ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"].

Issues:
- "Quality_Check" is incorrectly included. It does appear as a first event in case C-77, so it should NOT be listed.
- "Validate_Order" and "Pack_Items" are missing; both never appear first but are omitted.
- "Ship_Order" is correctly included (neither A-9321 nor B-1045 nor C-77 have this as their first event).

Given that Q5 is notably incomplete and includes a factual error, but all other answers are perfect, this warrants a substantial penalty but not complete failureâ€”hence, 6.0.
