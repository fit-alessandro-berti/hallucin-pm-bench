9.0

1. The LLM correctly states that “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs 1 time.
2. The percentage calculation (5.56%) is correct and derived exactly as per the ground truth.
3. The case identifier (A1002) is correctly identified.
4. For sampling issues, the LLM gives:
   - "Small Sample Size": matches the ground truth, with adequate explanation.
   - "Lack of Temporal Representation": essentially the "Temporal bias" point; the wording is different but the intent is the same (fragment covers just a single day, possibly unrepresentative).

Points docked:
- The LLM writes “the fragment represents only a single day” for Q4, but the actual fragment only gives timestamps for 2025-05-01 between 09:00 and 14:05. It would have been stricter to specify that it covers only part of the day, and not assume it's an entire single day.
- LLM omits case-mix bias and survivorship/truncation bias, but since only two reasons are requested, this is not a deduction.
- The LLM formats the percentage as "5.56%" (no space), but ground truth uses "5.56 %".

No hallucations or unjustified inferences are present. The answers almost perfectly match the ground truth, with only small nitpicks justifying a modest point deduction.

Final score: 9.0
