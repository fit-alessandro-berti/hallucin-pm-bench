9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, focusing on factual accuracy, derivation solely from the provided log (no hallucinations or inferences), completeness, and phrasing/precision where relevant. Minor deviations in wording or depth result in point deductions, as per the strict criteria. Total events (18) and the single occurrence in case A1002 are correctly used without external assumptions.

1. **Exact match** (1 occurrence). No deduction.

2. **Exact match** (5.56%, with equivalent calculation shown). No deduction.

3. **Near match** (identifies A1002 correctly, implying singularity). Minor deduction (-0.2) for not explicitly stating "only" or using the ground truth's precise phrasing ("Only case A1002 contains"), which could subtly under-emphasize exclusivity in a strict reading.

4. **Strong match** (provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons directly aligning with ground truth options: small sample size and temporal bias). Reasons are stated clearly without extraneous info. Minor deduction (-0.3) for lacking the ground truth's deeper elaboration (e.g., variance quantification in small sample or specific time window details in temporal bias), reducing precision and illustrative value.

Overall: Excellent adherence to the log and questions, with only subtle phrasing/detail gaps preventing a perfect score.
