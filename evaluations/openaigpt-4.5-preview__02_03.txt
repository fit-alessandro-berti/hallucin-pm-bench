9.5

- The LLM answer is essentially correct and well-formulated.
- The first answer gives: "3 ("C123", "C456", "C789")" which is slightly more verbose than the ground truth, but accurate. However, the wording "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" is requested, so the non-matching wording (lack of the word "cases" after "3") is a minor deviation.
- Answers 2 and 3 match the ground truth.
- Given the instruction for utmost strictness and that even small errors should have significant point loss, the small wording deviation in answer 1 warrants a minor deduction.
- Thus, the score is 9.5.
