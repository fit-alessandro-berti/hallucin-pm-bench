The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accurately identifying and listing all three parallel blocks from Process B with correct tasks and no extraneous mentions. The only minor deviation is the addition of a short introductory sentence ("Here's the enumeration of concurrent tasks for Process B:"), which is not present in the ground truth and slightly deviates from the instruction to return the answer directly as numbered lines. Under utmost strictness, this small formatting infringement warrants a minor deduction (0.5 points), but the core response remains precise and compliant.
