**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiencies, ~60% penalty)**: Ground truth identifies **3 explicit decision points** with precise branching logic/outcomes (eligibility check, amount threshold post-PreApprove, final approval). LLM lists only **2**, omitting the critical **high-value threshold** ("if > €1 000 → Senior_Auditor_Review"). Descriptions are vague/inaccurate: (1) describes activity, not decision/branching; (2) invents "Final documentation is determined" (not in process; no branching shown). No table/structure matching ground truth's clarity/summary format.
- **Required Documents (Significant Omission, ~25% penalty)**: Ground truth lists **all 7** (including **RefundConfirmationPDF**). LLM misses **RefundConfirmationPDF** entirely. Minor accuracy on AuditTrail conditional note, but incomplete catalogue.
- **Format & Fidelity (~15% penalty)**: Python code irrelevant/unrequested; lacks ground truth's structured table, numbering, branching details, and closing note. Introduces undefined phrasing (e.g., "Ensures," "Final documentation").
- **Overall**: ~70-80% content mismatch/omissions. Strict policy: even small errors (e.g., missing 1 doc) deduct heavily; multiple large ones justify low score. No adherence to "Do not introduce... not defined above."
