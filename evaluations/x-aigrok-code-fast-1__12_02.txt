The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in structure, content, and factual citations, correctly identifying the core counterexamples in C003 (lines 6-7) and C005 (line 11) to refute the "always follows" claim. It adheres to the prompt's format of a single "No" followed by a one-paragraph justification with line numbers and case-IDs. The only minor difference is the inclusion of confirmatory examples from C001, C002, and C004, which adds unnecessary detail not present in the ground truth and slightly deviates from its concise bullet-point focus on counterexamples alone; under utmost strictness, this extraneous information warrants a small deduction despite no factual errors.
