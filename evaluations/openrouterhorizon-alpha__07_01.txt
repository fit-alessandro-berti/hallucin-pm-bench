The LLM answer correctly identifies all the key factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, it loses points for significant deviations from the ground truth in presentation and detail: (1) It lists only task IDs without including the corresponding names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" for check_vip), which are factual elements present in the XML and included in the ground truth—omitting them makes the response less complete and descriptive, violating the intent to report "factual differences that can be read from the XML." (2) Headings are not bolded as in the ground truth, and bullet styles differ (• vs. *). (3) The gateway change phrasing is concise but less precise, lacking explicit version references (v1/v2) and using an arrow symbol instead of "changed from ... to ...". These are not minor formatting issues under strict evaluation, as they reduce fidelity to the expected output structure and completeness, but the core content accuracy prevents a lower score.
