The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time of “Review Contract” cannot be derived due to lack of timestamp or elapsed-time information. However, it misses explicitly noting that the information given does not even allow calculation of cycle time because there is no temporal data of any kind, not just missing duration fields—it could have been more explicit about the lack of **any** timing or ordering information, as the ground truth does. There is also no brief explanation tying both questions together in clear terms (“calculation” is not broken out explicitly for Q2, merely implied in the statement).

Minor loss of points for:

- Not addressing the requirement to “briefly explain your calculation” directly as a second step (even if the explanation is essentially negative).
- Missing the explicit clarity that not only are elapsed-time fields redacted/missing, but also no order or timing data exists to infer durations.

Otherwise, the answer fulfills the instruction strictly, does not fabricate data, and correctly declines to answer—so a high score, but not a perfect 10.
