The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived, explicitly referencing the lack of timestamps and elapsed-time fields, and it notes that the historical benchmarks do not apply. Its reasoning aligns with the ground truth answer: both cite the absence of temporal information and correctly refrain from providing a fabricated value. There are no errors or omissions in the LLM's response compared to the ground truth.
