### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer fails critically on core requirements, warranting a near-minimum score under strict criteria. Key failures include:

- **Incorrect Activity Selection (Major Deduction -40%):** Identifies Credit Assessment and Legal Approval correctly (both high SLA breaches and waits), but erroneously selects Fund Disbursement as the third worst performer. Data shows Fund Disbursement throughput (60s) meets/underperforms SLA (120s) with low wait (50s), while Risk Review (throughput 600s vs. SLA 300s, +300s breach; wait 480s) is a clear top offender jointly on breaches and waits. This misidentifies 1/3 activities, inverting the "worst-performing" analysis.

- **Inaccurate Quantification (Major Deduction -30%):** 
  - Credit Assessment: Claims +120s breach (actual: 300s - 240s = +60s); invents "75s delay" and cases/hour metrics absent from data.
  - Legal Approval: Invents SLA as 900s and actual 1200s (+300s wrong basis; data: 900s vs. 600s = +300s, but throughput misstated); adds fabricated throughput (0.466 cases/hour) and targets.
  - Fund Disbursement: Falsely claims +100s breach (actual under SLA); invents throughput (7.89/hour), targets (8/hour TEQ), and "hidden delays."
  All exceedances must be data-grounded; inventions violate "Ground every sentence in the data" rule.

- **Non-Data-Driven Recommendations (Major Deduction -20%):** Bullets used correctly for recs only (minor positive), but actions are generic/vague (e.g., "reduce by 5% via automation" lacks data tie; "assign staff" ignores case volumes like 465). Ground truth ties to data (e.g., "low-risk files bypass," "loans under â‚¬25k"). No concrete, quantifiable basis from table metrics/cases.

- **Structural and Inventive Violations (Minor but Cumulative Deduction -10%):** Bullets activities (violates "bullet points only for recommendations"); invents unrelated metrics (e.g., "7.6 cases/hour," "5.2 hours target") throughout, breaching "no metrics not provided." Memo ~180 words (close to 150), but closing projection unsubstantiated vs. ground truth's "35% reduction." Headers/subject similar but not precise (e.g., no case total like "4,805").

Overall alignment to ground truth: ~30% (partial activity overlap, format echoes). Errors compound to disqualify as reliable; strictness demands heavy penalties for fabrications and factual distortions.
