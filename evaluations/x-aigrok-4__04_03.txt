The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and gives concise justifications for each rule, matching the gold standard in substance. 

- For Rule 1: Correct (explicitly says QE before RA & both occur once).
- For Rule 2: Correct (notes VP occurs after both QE and RA).
- For Rule 3: Correctly identifies violation â€” NA occurs before RA. (Succinctly, but matches reasoning.)
- For Rule 4: Correct (CC happens after NA and VP).

The only minor deviation is that the explanation for rule 3 is not as precise in wording as the gold standard ("NA occurs after QE but before RA" vs "NA must wait until **both** QE and RA are finished"), and the format doesn't use the exact tabular breakdown, but the logical content is accurate.

Due to the requirement of utmost strictness and penalizing small errors, especially in the degree of justification and clarity, I deduct 1 point.
