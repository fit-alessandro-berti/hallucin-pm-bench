The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifying "No" compliance and providing a concise justification that references all rules with precise assessments. It matches the ground truth in factual content, violation identification (Rule 3 due to NA before RA), and satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4. Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., not explicitly stating "both QE and RA are finished" in Rule 3, and bullet format vs. table) and lacking an explicit overall non-compliance summary phrase, though these do not introduce errors.
