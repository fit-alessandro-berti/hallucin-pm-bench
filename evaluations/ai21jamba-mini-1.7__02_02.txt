3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
This score reflects utmost strictness: Q1 is fully correct (+3.0 points, as it's exact). Q2 has critical errors—hallucinated extra "Check_Stock" event (not in C002), incorrect chronological order (Arrange_Delivery precedes Ship_Order by timestamp 10:15:20 vs. 10:25:40, but listed after), resulting in a fabricated sequence (-4.0 deduction for factual inaccuracy and hallucination). Q3 fails on content (includes "Ship_Order" as a preceding activity, which is impossible; duplicates "Check_Stock" unnecessarily), format (uses "→" separators instead of one per line; not truly alphabetized as it appends the target activity), and completeness (misses proper distinct list) (-5.0 deduction for multiple fabrications and non-compliance). No partial credit for structure, as errors compound to undermine the entire response.
