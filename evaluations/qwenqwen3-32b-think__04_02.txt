4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer matches the ground truth on status and justification for R1, R3, R4, and R6 (minor wording variations within â‰¤20 words, no impact). R5 status matches (Violated), but justification omits Pay_Invoice (focuses only on Ship_Goods), introducing a partial inaccuracy (-1.0 point deduction for incompleteness). R2 is a critical error: status incorrectly "Compliant" (vs. ground truth "Violated") with fully mismatched justification ignoring the re-approval after Change_Request, leading to wrong timeline analysis (-5.0 deduction for fundamental misinterpretation). Overall result matches (NON-COMPLIANT), but the R2 flaw undermines the audit's integrity. Strict scoring reflects these differences: base 10.0 minus 6.0 total for errors.
