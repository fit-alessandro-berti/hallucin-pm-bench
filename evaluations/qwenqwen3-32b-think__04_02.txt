6.0

- R1: Correct (compliance status and justification).
- R2: **Incorrect.** LLM says "Compliant," ground truth is "Violated". The LLM incorrectly treats the Finance approval as the last required approval, ignoring the need for Manager approval after the Change_Request, per R5, so the 2-day window should be calculated from **the second** (post-change) Manager Approval. This is a critical error.
- R3: Correct (compliance status and justification).
- R4: Correct.
- R5: Correct.
- R6: Correct.
- Overall result: Correct.

The main error is in R2, which directly contradicts the ground truth. The justifications for the other rules are generally acceptable and within the length limit, though some wording could be slightly more explicit (e.g., in R5, "Ship_Goods (Mar-05) precedes reapproval" could explicitly reference the timing issue with the Change_Request and required Manager reapproval). However, the most serious flaw is the misjudgment on R2, which demonstrates a misunderstanding of the interplay between R2 and R5. 

Due to this significant error, even though the rest of the rules are assessed correctly, a strict scoring approach requires a **substantial deduction**. 6.0 reflects severe loss of points for the R2 error, plus small losses for less-than-perfect justification wordings elsewhere.
