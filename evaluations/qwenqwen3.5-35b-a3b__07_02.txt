9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Content accuracy (full marks, no deductions)**: All changes correctly identified. Added: exactly the 3 new tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject). Removed: exactly Task_RejectLoan. Gateway: correctly notes type change on Gateway_Decision from exclusive to inclusive. No extraneous changes (e.g., ignores name changes on Task_ApproveLoan, Gateway_Decision; ignores flows/XML order). Matches prompt's "all changes" under exact headings.
- **Deductions (total -0.8)**:
  - **Format/style mismatches (-0.4)**: Bulleted lists (*) vs. numbered (1., 2., 3.); consistent but not matching GT. Minor indentation/whitespace diffs.
  - **Task presentation reversed (-0.2)**: ID first ``(`ID`) (name)`` vs. GT's name-first ``**name** (`ID`)`` (emphasizes human-readable name).
  - **Gateway phrasing (-0.2)**: Concise and XML-accurate ("ExclusiveGateway to InclusiveGateway"), but lacks GT's descriptive "exclusive (XOR) ... inclusive (OR)", v1/v2 refs, bolding, and structure (e.g., **Gateway\_Decision**). Close to prompt example ("Exclusive → Inclusive"), but strict diff.
- No factual errors, omissions, or extras. No final note in LLM (GT has it, but prompt doesn't require). Semantically near-identical; deductions only for visible/textual diffs per "utmost strictness".
