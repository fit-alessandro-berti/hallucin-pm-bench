**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually precise, complete, and directly matches the ground truth across all questions with no deviations, hallucinations, extra/missing elements, or formatting errors relative to the prompt's instructions:

- **Q1/A1**: Identical ("3").
- **Q2/A2**: Identical sequence ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"); ground truth backslashes are markdown escapes, not part of the activity names.
- **Q3/A3**: Identical content (distinct predecessors: "Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock", alphabetically ordered, one per line); ground truth bullets/<br> are presentational, not required by prompt ("one per line"). LLM format precisely follows prompt spec.

Reasoning is accurate and supports answers without introducing errors. Perfect score under strict evaluation.
