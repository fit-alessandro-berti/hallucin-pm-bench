The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (two added tasks, one removed task, and the exact gateway type change) with no extras or omissions, aligning with the prompt's requirements for only those categories and no speculation. However, it loses points for significant format differences from the ground truth: (1) presenting full XML element snippets (including unnecessary tags and exact whitespace like extra spaces in attributes) instead of a clean summary using task names and IDs in parentheses; (2) using bullet points with full-line quotes rather than concise, descriptive list items; (3) describing the gateway change with verbose full tags instead of focusing solely on the type shift with version labels; and (4) lacking the ground truth's optional but explicit note on no other differences. These are not minor style variances but substantive deviations in summarization style and readability, warranting a strict deduction despite accurate content.
