The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 with a valid conceptual explanation, and provides the exact minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth for Q2, demonstrating T5 firing before T3. However, it lacks the detailed markings (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}) and the confirmatory note on T3 being disabled post-T5, which provide explicit verification and reduce ambiguity. Under strict evaluation, this omission of supporting details constitutes a minor but notable difference in completeness, warranting a deduction. Word count is compliant (<120).
