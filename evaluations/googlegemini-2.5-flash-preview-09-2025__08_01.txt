### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible for T5 to fire before T3 (matching the ground truth's "Yes"), provides a valid, concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) that demonstrates this from the initial marking, and offers a brief justification focused on the enabling conditions and concurrent enablement at M2. This directly addresses the prompt's requirements without factual errors. Markings and transition details are accurately described.

However, under strict evaluation, deduct 1.0 point for key differences from the ground truth:
- It omits the deeper insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 (due to the inhibitor arc permanently disabling T5 after T3), which is a central part of the ground truth's justification and explains the structural impossibility of the reverse order.
- The sequence is shorter and stops before showing T3's firing or subsequent effects (e.g., T4), missing the ground truth's fuller illustration of reachability and inhibitor implications.
- Minor stylistic gaps: Less emphasis on the inhibitor's role in preventing post-T3 firing, and no explicit note that this is the *only* window for T5.

These omissions represent incomplete alignment with the ground truth's comprehensive reasoning, warranting a significant but not severe deduction.
