4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, ~40% of Score Impact)**: The ground truth identifies and summarizes three explicit decision points with clear branching logic and outcomes (e.g., eligibility rejection, amount threshold branches, final approval/rejection leading to payment or end). The LLM answer lists three items but frames them primarily as activity descriptions rather than true decision summaries. It omits all rejection outcomes (e.g., "Not eligible → claim rejected," "Rejected → process ends"), fails to explicitly detail the low-value branch (≤ €1,000 skip), and misses the combined final approval decision at pre-approve/auditor stages. This introduces incompleteness and inaccuracy, treating steps as decisions without the required logic/outcomes. Strict penalty for these omissions and lack of precision.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Match, ~40% of Score Impact)**: The list is identical to the ground truth (7 items, including the conditional note on *AuditTrail*), with no extras introduced. Perfect alignment here.

- **Overall Structure, Fidelity, and Adherence (Minor Issues, ~20% of Score Impact)**: The LLM follows the prompt by not adding undefined elements (good), but uses a less structured format (simple lists vs. ground truth's table) and adds extraneous closing text ("Let me know..."), which deviates slightly. No mention of the "no legacy activities" note, but this is minor. The response is concise but not as analytically rigorous.

This score reflects strict evaluation: perfect documents save it from lower, but decision point differences are substantive errors, warranting significant deduction.
