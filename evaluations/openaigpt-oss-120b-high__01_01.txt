8.2

**Evaluation:**

The LLM answer very closely matches the ground truth, but under strict review, a few notable differences and minor inaccuracies lower the score.

**Decision Points:**

- **Eligibility Check (1):** Correctly identified as the first decision (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility). It describes eligibility but doesn’t explicitly state the potential outcome of “claim rejected/returned” (although “stops” is functionally equivalent, it's less precise).

- **Amount Threshold (2):** The LLM misses an explicit decision point regarding the amount threshold *immediately after* Finance_Controller_PreApprove—this is handled implicitly by describing the “high-value branch” and in Senior_Auditor_Review, but does not clearly identify the threshold check as a stand-alone branching decision. In the ground truth, it is an explicit decision: Amount > €1,000 ↔ Senior_Auditor_Review or not.

- **Final payment approval (3):** The LLM treats Finance_Controller_PreApprove and Senior_Auditor_Review as independent decisions (i.e., two approvals), listing both as decision points, but does not clearly frame the *final* approval as the last gate before payment (ground truth combines these as the last approval needed). 

- **Constraint Clarification:** Positively, the LLM correctly points out that “Process_Refund_Payment” is gated procedurally and not a separate decision point.

**Documents:**

- The list of documents is comprehensive and correctly references all artifacts with step mapping. The usage and conditionality (e.g., AuditTrail only for claims > €1,000) match the ground truth.

- Terminology: The document names align precisely with the process description.

**Strictness Notes:**

- The lack of an explicit, stand-alone “amount threshold” decision causes a notable markdown (significant difference per instructions).
- The framing of final approval—disaggregating Finance_Controller_PreApprove and Senior_Auditor_Review as separate “decision points” rather than showing their aggregation—is a subtle but real deviation.
- Minor: “Stops” vs “rejected/returned” for ineligible claims is imprecise wording under the demanded strictness.

**No extraneous artefacts or activities are introduced; legacy exclusion is stated.**

**Overall:** While very strong and sufficiently detailed, the answer falls short of absolute correctness in its structuring of the branching logic and decision articulation. These gaps, though not egregious, must incur a substantive penalty per the grading instructions.

**Final grade: 8.2** (Highly accurate, with structural and phrasing deviations that meaningfully reduce the score relative to strict expectations.)
