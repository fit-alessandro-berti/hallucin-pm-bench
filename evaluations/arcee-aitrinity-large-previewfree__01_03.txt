**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Part (a) - Decision Points (major errors; ~40% alignment):**
- Ground truth identifies **exactly 2 decision points**: (1) the post-Tri-Color conditional skip (precise rule phrasing), (2) TriVote gate (precise "at least two approvals" rule).
- LLM incorrectly lists **3 points**:
  1. Wrongly treats "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" as a decision point/gate/branch; it is merely a check producing an input *for* the actual conditional branch (not a rule-based decision itself). This is a hallucinated/inaccurate identification; phrasing is not a "rule in one sentence" but just an output description.
  2. Skip conditional is mostly accurate but lacks ground truth's precision (e.g., no "bypasses... otherwise proceeds"; minor rephrasing ok but strictness docks).
  3. TriVote is accurate in rule but adds extraneous "requires approvals from all three" (misleading, as only 2 suffice).
- Penalty: Extraneous point + misclassification + imprecise count/phrasing = severe deduction (not "every" correctly; invents one).

**Part (b) - Documents (critical omissions; ~55% alignment):**
- Ground truth: **9 distinct documents** in first-appearance order, explicitly including **Scorecard–Cyan/Magenta/Yellow** (step 3 inputs), **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (step 8, distinct from unsigned step 7), etc.
- LLM lists only **5/9** (misses **4 key ones**):
  - Omits all 3 Scorecards (explicit "Inputs:" in step 3; unambiguously "required").
  - Merges/omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (step 8 lists it separately as a required document post-signature).
- Order correct for listed items, no hallucinations (good), but ~44% missing = catastrophic (strictness: even "small" misses penalized heavily; these are not small).
- Total: Partial credit for accuracy of listed items, but incompleteness dominates.

**Overall:** Strong strictness applied—~2/3 total mismatch across identification, count, completeness, precision. No credit for extras/irrelevants. Aggregated: 3.2 (not 1.0 as some accuracy exists; not higher due to core failures).
