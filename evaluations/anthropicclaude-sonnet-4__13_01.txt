The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth across all four questions: correct count (1), exact percentage (5.56%), accurate case listing (A1002 only), and two valid sampling-related reasons (temporal coverage bias aligning with temporal bias; sample size inadequacy aligning with small sample size). No deviations, inferences, or errors detected, even under strict evaluation.
