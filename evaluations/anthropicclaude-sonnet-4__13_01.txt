The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the required standards:

1. It states “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs once—correct.
2. It gives the correct percentage (5.56%) and shows the calculation.
3. It correctly lists only case A1002.
4. It gives two sampling-related reasons (temporal coverage bias and sample size inadequacy) which align with those in the ground truth and are stated correctly and clearly, without overgeneralization or inference.

No information is introduced beyond the log, and the explanations are succinct and accurate. No errors are present.
