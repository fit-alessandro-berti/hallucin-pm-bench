10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and formatting (minor spacing in percentages is negligible). For question 3, the response is concise (85 words), directly addresses the single occurrence (low support), highlights instability (skewing metrics, over-fitting), and warns of over-generalization (unreliable forecasts on full population), fulfilling all specified criteria without invention or deviation from the log. No errors or omissions.
