The LLM answer does NOT follow the constraint of not changing the process logic/order: it suggests rearranging activities by swapping the order of "Triage Claim" and completeness checks, which is a significant behavioral change and could alter business requirements. The correct solution, per the ground truth, is to ADD an interrupting boundary timer event to "Task_Receive" that, if triggered, forces the path directly to "Task_Triage" without modifying the sequence or nature of the core tasks.

**Major issues:**
- The solution recommends a redesign (swapping and reconnecting flows), NOT a minimal compliance-focussed enhancement using timer/intermediate events as requested.
- The LLM answer disrupts business semantics and the meaning of process steps.
- No timer event is used, ignoring the direct, compliant fix.

**Small credit**: The idea is loosely related to accelerating "Triage Claim", but is fundamentally incorrect as an answer to the prompt and constraints.

**Scoring**: Almost full penalty. Only basic awareness of the SLA issue and the mention of "flow reconnection" prevent zero marks.
