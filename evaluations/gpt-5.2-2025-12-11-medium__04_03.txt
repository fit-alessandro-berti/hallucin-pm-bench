9.5

The LLM answer is factually perfect (correct "No", identical rule assessments, accurate violation pinpointed on Rule 3 with matching reasoning), fully prompt-compliant (Yes/No + short justification referencing *all* rules), and concise. Minor deductions (-0.5) for: (1) lack of table format matching ground truth's structure; (2) slightly less emphatic phrasing in Rule 3 (omits explicit "both QE and RA are finished" restatement); (3) no explicit final summary sentence. No content errors.
