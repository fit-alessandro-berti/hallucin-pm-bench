The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: "check_vip" and "generate_qr"; removed: "send_rma_label"; gateway: "gw_valid" from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway) with exact names from the XML `name` attributes. No incorrect additions, removals, or speculation. Headings match the required exact format (• bullets).

However, under utmost strictness:
- Missing explicit IDs for all tasks (e.g., no "(id = `check_vip`)"), present in ground truth for all listed items: significant omission of factual XML details (-1.0).
- Gateway phrasing less precise ("gw_valid: from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway" vs. "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), lacking version labels, backticks, and bolding (-0.5).
- Minor formatting diffs (bullets: - vs. *; headings lack bolding): small errors warranting loss (-0.5).
- Lacks ground truth's final note "*(No other differences should be reported.)*": minor but explicit diff (-0.0 as non-required).

Core accuracy high, but diffs prevent perfect score.
