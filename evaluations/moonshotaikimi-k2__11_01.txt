### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, numbers)**: Perfect match. The three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability) are correctly identified and ranked #1–#3. Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5 h / 120 h, etc.), with no service-time or extraneous metrics mentioned. (+10/10)
- **Format and Constraints**: Crisp memo-style structure under 150 words (LLM: ~80 words). Focuses solely on waiting times and the specified activities. No unwarranted content. Minor formatting variances (e.g., "95 th" vs. "p95"; "|" delimiter vs. commas) are negligible. (+9.5/10)
- **Actions**: Logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation to reduce delays) and each promises ≥20% reduction with data-driven claims (e.g., "pilot cut 25%", "target 22 %", "expect ≥20 %"). However, all three recommendations differ substantially from ground truth (e.g., auto-populate/email vs. reminders; trigger generation vs. e-signature; dispatch/no batch vs. rules-engine). This introduces significant content divergence, violating strict alignment to the provided ground truth example. (-1.3 points penalty for differences)

Overall strict score reflects factual excellence but penalizes creative deviations in the core recommendation section, per evaluation criteria emphasizing minimal differences.
