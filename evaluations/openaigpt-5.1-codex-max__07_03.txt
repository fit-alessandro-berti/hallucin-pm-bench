The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with perfect matching of all content, structure, headings (verbatim), bullet points, task formats (id followed by (name)), and gateway change descriptions (id: old → new). All verifiable functional changes are correctly identified and grouped: 3 added tasks, 1 removed task, 2 gateway type changes. No extra commentary, guesses, or unchanged elements mentioned.

The sole difference is minor whitespace/formatting: the ground truth aligns the "exclusive → parallel" text across gateway lines by adding extra spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" (approximately 5 spaces for column alignment in monospace). The LLM uses a consistent single space after each colon, matching the prompt's example format exactly (`Gateway_X: exclusive → parallel`). Under utmost strictness, this small textual difference (non-semantic whitespace) warrants a significant but limited deduction (0.5 points), as content and required format are flawless.
