8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer; removed: Task_ManualReview; gateway changes: both from exclusive to parallel), with no additions, omissions, or commentary, adhering to the core instructions. However, under strict evaluation, formatting deviations from the ground truth incur point deductions: (1) inclusion of leading "-" before each heading (absent in ground truth); (2) absence of leading "-" before each list item (present in ground truth for all tasks and gateways); (3) minor misalignment in the second gateway entry (ground truth uses extra spaces after the colon for apparent alignment, which the LLM lacks). These are small but consistent structural errors in a format-sensitive task, warranting a significant but not total deduction from a perfect score.
