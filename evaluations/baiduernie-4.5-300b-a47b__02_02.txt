The LLM answer is highly accurate in content and structure, correctly identifying the distinct cases (3), the exact sequence for C002 (minor formatting difference: lacks spaces around "â†’", deviating slightly from the ground truth's spacing while matching the prompt's separator requirement), and the distinct predecessors of "Ship_Order" (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock, properly alphabetized and listed one per line, though ground truth uses bulleted markdown). No factual errors or hallucinations, but the Q2 spacing inconsistency warrants a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria for precise matching.
