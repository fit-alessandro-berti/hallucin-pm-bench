10.0

The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth on all three questions:

- Q1: Correctly identifies there are 3 distinct cases.
- Q2: Returns the correct sequence of activities for C002, using the exact order and correct separator.
- Q3: Correctly lists the two distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" across all cases, alphabetised, one per line, with no extra or missing elements.

There are no inaccuracies, missing information, or hallucinations present. Even the formatting complies (with minimal, non-essential explanation that does not alter the factual content). Thus, the correct strict score is 10.0.
