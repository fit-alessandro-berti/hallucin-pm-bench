8.5

The LLM answer contains both required pairs and lists them in the correct alphabetical order. However, there are two noticeable deviations from the ground truth:

- The pair "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" is missing an extra space before and after the em dash, which breaks the requested formatting: `Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines` (ground truth uses four spaces before and after the em dash).
- The answer does not use the code block formatting shown in the ground truth.

Both of these are minor but explicit formatting instructions, and their absence must be penalized per the “utmost strictness” guideline—the ground truth even underscores the spacing in the output. Otherwise, the answer is fully correct in task comprehension and pair generation.

Therefore, an 8.5 is warranted rather than a perfect 10.0.
