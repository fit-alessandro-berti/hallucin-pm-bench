The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, identifying the correct and only two parallel pairs, with proper alphabetical ordering both within pairs and in the overall list. The specified format is followed, including spacing around the em dash. Minor visual differences (e.g., lack of exact dash alignment in the second line, which is not explicitly required) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they do not alter meaning, structure, or compliance.
