9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps as the key reason for impossibility, with only minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and "elapsed time... unknown" vs. "intervals... absent") that do not alter the meaning or completeness. Under strict evaluation, the lack of exact wording match deducts 0.5 points.
