10.0

The LLM answer is a perfect match with the ground truth. Here’s the breakdown:

- Q1: The number of distinct cases is correctly answered as 3, with all case IDs listed as explanation.
- Q2: The sequence for case C002 is exactly as specified: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order, with the correct separator and order.
- Q3: The list of activities immediately preceding "Ship_Order" contains “Arrange_Delivery” and “Check_Stock”, each on a single line, alphabetically ordered. The explanation given is an accurate, step-by-step derivation and matches the ground truth.
- Formatting, delimiters, order, and explanation are all correct and there are no hallucinations, omissions, or errors.

No errors or omissions (even formatting nuances are handled correctly), so the score is 10.0.
