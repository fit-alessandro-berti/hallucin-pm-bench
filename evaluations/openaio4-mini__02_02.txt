The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content, structure, and adherence to the prompt's instructions across all questions. Q1 is identical. Q2 sequences the exact activities for C002 in chronological order with the specified separator, using the correct activity names (underscores are formatting artifacts in the ground truth, not substantive differences). Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line, without extras, omissions, or errorsâ€”bullets in the ground truth are presentational and not required by the prompt. No hallucinations or deviations detected.
