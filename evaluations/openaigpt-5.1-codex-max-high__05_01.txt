**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Major differences (severe deductions)**: Core suggestion attaches timer to `Task_RequestDocs` (LLM) vs. `Task_Receive` (ground truth)—fundamentally different element, altering the improvement entirely (-4.0).
- **Timer specification mismatch**: Vague "timeDate/`timeDuration` set to 48 hours from `Start_Claim`" vs. precise `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>` XML snippet (-1.5). LLM's absolute-time intent mismatches relative duration.
- **Minor differences**: "e.g., `Timer_48h`" vs. exact `id="Timer_48h"`; path-specific "waiting for missing docs" vs. general "any outstanding document requests"; no explicit "no new tasks" clause (-1.0).
- **Similarities (partial credit)**: Both suggest interrupting boundary timer + sequence flow to `Task_Triage`; short plain English; ID references; SLA intent (+0.5).
- Total reflects utmost strictness: ~70% mismatch on key mechanics.
