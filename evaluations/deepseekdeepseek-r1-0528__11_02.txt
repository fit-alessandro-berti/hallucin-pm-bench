8.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities as the ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), aligning with key table metrics like high wait times (150 min and 18 min), rework (22%), processing time (25 min), variability (9 min stdev), and SLA breaches (12.4% and 3.2%). Explanations are strictly table-based, avoiding hallucinations and noting insignificant gaps per the prompt—strong adherence here. Actions are concrete and data-driven, tied to specific issues (e.g., automation for rework, standardization for variability, reallocation for queuing).

However, under strict criteria, deduct points for:
- **Incomplete explanations**: Omits Review_Documents' 30 min queue (emphasized in ground truth as a key precursor to congestion) and downplays Initial_Assessment's role in "feeding later congestion" or its 12 min processing time.
- **Less precise actions**: Recommendations are solid but less ambitious/specific than ground truth (e.g., "standardize checklists" addresses only variability, not processing time or AI like ground truth; staff reallocation implies but doesn't explicitly target wait/processing cuts via triage). No projected impacts (e.g., +10% throughput, -40% breaches) for executive value.
- **Minor structural/emphasis gaps**: "Throughput collapse" phrasing is accurate but interpretive; lacks ground truth's flow-relief summary. Word count compliant (199 ≤ 200), but overall less comprehensive in tying bottlenecks to end-to-end effects.

These small omissions and variances (not identical fidelity) warrant a significant but not catastrophic deduction from a potential 10.0, as the core task is met without major errors.
