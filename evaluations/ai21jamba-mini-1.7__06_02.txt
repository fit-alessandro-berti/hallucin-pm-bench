The LLM answer fails entirely to identify or group the concurrent task sets from Process B, instead listing individual sequential tasks (including non-parallel ones like Accept_Custom_Order, Dry_Fit_Assembly, and Glue_And_Clamp) in an incorrect format with step numbers and parentheses. It omits all actual parallel blocks (P1, P2, P3) and includes irrelevant sequencing, resulting in zero alignment with the ground truth.
