2.0

The LLM answer receives a score of **2.0**. Here’s the justification:

**Major Flaws:**
- The answer does not correctly identify the parallel blocks in Process B as described.
- It incorrectly numbers and itemizes individual tasks (including sequential steps), rather than grouping together only the concurrent tasks from each parallel block.
- The numbering seems arbitrary and does not correspond to the described process blocks.
- Only three distinct sets of concurrently-executable tasks should be enumerated (as in the ground truth), while the LLM lists eight lines, none of which feature correct parallel groupings.

**Minor Positives:**
- The tasks mentioned are all from Process B (no contamination from other processes).
- The answer avoids tasks from A and C as instructed.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of what constitutes concurrently executable tasks per the process description; it lists tasks individually rather than sets of concurrent activities, leading to a near-complete deviation from the ground truth—hence the strict low score.
