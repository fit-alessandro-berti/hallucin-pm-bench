**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core correctness (major credit: ~60% base)**: Correctly identifies interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` (PT48H), links to existing `Activity_AMReview` via sequenceFlow, uses unused escalation path, no new activities added. Matches intent perfectly.
- **XML structural errors (major deductions: -3.0)**: 
  - Extraneous, standalone `<bpmn:timerEventDefinition>` block (invalid, non-nestable snippet; breaks XML validity).
  - Duplicate `<bpmn:timerEventDefinition>` (unnecessary redundancy).
  - Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<bpmn:timeDuration>` (inconsistent with original model's conditionExpressions; ground truth includes it).
  - No `name="48h breach"` on boundaryEvent.
  - Lacks explanatory comments (e.g., `<!-- ❶ -->`).
- **Minor diffs (further -1.5)**: Different IDs (`Timer_SLA`/`Flow_09_escalation` vs `Boundary_LateCreate`/`Flow_LateEscalation`); no bolding or exact phrasing in justification; calls it "timer boundary event" vs "interrupting 48-hour boundary timer"; "unused" vs "pre-existing"; full task name vs shortened.
- **Justification (minor credit/deduction: neutral)**: One sentence, accurate concept, but not verbatim match (wording, emphasis, label `*Justification (1 sentence):*`).
- **Overall**: Concept spot-on, but XML not copy-paste ready/valid (significant for BPMN consultant task); strictness demands near-exactness for high score.
