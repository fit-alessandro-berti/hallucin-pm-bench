**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment vs. Ground Truth)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**:
  - Perfect adherence to vocabulary policy: Uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly; no forbidden terms.
  - Correct activities (rows) and roles (columns); no extras introduced.
  - Main *Responsible* roles align with narrative performers (AM for Receive/Order/Notify; CO for KYC; FC for Payment; IT for Record).
  - Table structure intact; bolding on key cells present (though inconsistent with GT).

- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **RACI mismatches** (8+ cells differ, core content failure):
    | Activity | Key Differences |
    |----------|-----------------|
    | Receive Application | CO: I vs **C** |
    | KYC Review | AM: **C** vs **A**; CO: **A/R** vs **R**; FC: I vs **C** |
    | Order Vetting | Minor notation (**A/R** vs **R / A**), but functionally close |
    | Payment Clearance | AM: I vs **A**; CO: I vs **C**; FC: **A/R** vs **R** |
    | Record Update | IT: **A/R** vs **R** |
    | Notify Customer | Notation (**A/R** vs **R / A**) |
    - Violates rubric: Not all RACI "reflect[s] the narrative" (e.g., misses AM as *Accountable* for KYC/Payment; incorrect C/I).
  - **Formatting/notation inconsistencies** (strict loss): **A/R** vs **R / A** or separate (e.g., GT splits A/R); activity bolding missing (GT bolds **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance**); headers add unwarranted "(AM)" etc.
  - **Unwarranted content**: Extra **Legend** (GT has none, violates "no extra... content").

- **Scoring**: 50% match on structure/terms/R's (5.0 base), minus 50% for RACI errors/formatting/extras. Utmost strictness applied; no leniency for "close" interpretations.
