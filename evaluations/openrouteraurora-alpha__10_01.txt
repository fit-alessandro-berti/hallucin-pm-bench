**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Vocabulary (perfect, +1.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms (**KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance**) with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Activities match exactly.
- **Structure (+0.5 partial)**: Correct rows/columns/roles (no extras). Table format present.
- **RACI allocations (major failures, -6.0+ penalty)**: 
  | Activity | Key differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | All rows | Missing all C/I entries (ground truth fills **every cell**); uses dashes (unwarranted simplification). |
  | Receive Application | Others should be C (CO), I (FC/IT); not –. |
  | **KYC Review** | CO **R** + AM **A** separate (not combined R/A); FC **C**, IT **I**. |
  | **Order Vetting** | CO **C**, FC/IT **I**. |
  | **Payment Clearance** | AM **A**; CO **C**, IT **I**. |
  | Record Update | AM **C**, CO **I**, FC **C** (not –). No mandated bold. |
  | Notify Customer | CO/FC/IT **I**. |
  - No row has exact match. Violates "exactly one Responsible" nuance and "Accountable where appropriate" per rubric (e.g., split A in 3 rows).
- **Formatting/extras (penalties)**: 
  - Extra title, **Key** section (explains unused C/I; unwarranted), end note.
  - Column headers add (AM) etc. (ground truth omits).
  - Over-bolding (all activities/R/A; ground truth selective, e.g., **R** bolded).
- **Overall**: ~70% divergence in core content (RACI cells); extras inflate differences. Strict rubric demands near-exact match; simplified view ignores inferred interactions. Minimal credit for terms/structure only.
