**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict per instructions):
- **Vocabulary (partial credit)**: Correctly uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly (no forbidden terms). Matches ground truth here (+1.0 potential).
- **Matrix structure**: Correct rows/activities, columns/roles. Minor formatting diffs (e.g., headers include "(AM)", all activities/R bolded vs. selective bolding; extra pipes/spacing) deduct -0.5.
- **RACI content (major failure, -6.0+ deduction)**: 
  - R positions correct (one R per row, matching performers/narrative), but AM tasks use **R** vs. ground truth **R / A** (3 mismatches).
  - No A, C, or I anywhere (all blanks) vs. ground truth's full matrix (every cell filled with precise A/C/I). Fails "RACI allocations reflect narrative" and "AM Accountable where appropriate."
  - 18/24 cells completely wrong (blank vs. A/C/I).
- **Unwarranted content**: Extra "Key" section, explanations ("not applicable", "no other roles involved"), and notes violate "no extra" (deduct -1.0).
- **Overall**: ~80% deviation in core matrix content; only skeleton R's match. Strictness demands near-exact match—partial R correctness insufficient for high score.
