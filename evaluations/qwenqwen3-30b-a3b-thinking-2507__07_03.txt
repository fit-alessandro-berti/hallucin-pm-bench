8.0

- The LLM answer captures all changes correctly: all added/removed tasks and both gateway type changes are listed and are correct.
- However, it omits the dash '-' prefix required for each item, which is a presentational format requirement rooted in the ground truth (each item is prefixed with '-').
- It also omits the extra space after the colon before the new gateway type on "Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel", which is present in the ground truth.
- These are minor, but since strictness is required and exact format matters (especially bullet/dash lists), a significant penalty is warranted. No factual errors, so not lower, but incomplete formatting prevents a perfect or near-perfect score.
