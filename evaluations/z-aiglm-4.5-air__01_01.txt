3.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiency, -4.0 points base penalty):** The ground truth identifies three distinct decision points: (1) eligibility validation in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** (with explicit branching to continue or reject), (2) the amount threshold after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** (matching the LLM's sole point), and (3) final approval in **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** / **Senior_Auditor_Review** (approved → payment; rejected → end). The LLM only covers the second one, explicitly stating it is the "only explicit decision point" and ignoring the implied but necessary pass/fail decisions in validation and approval steps (as per process logic and constraints requiring "succeeded" for progression). This omission of 2/3 decision points is a critical failure to "summarise every decision point," resulting in incomplete coverage. Even though the amount threshold is accurately described, the partial response halves the value at best.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Match, +2.0 points):** The LLM lists all seven documents from the prompt (**RefundRequestForm**, **FlightManifest**, **WeatherReport**, **EligibilityChecklist**, **AuditTrail** (conditional), **BankTransferAuthorization**, **RefundConfirmationPDF**) without introducing extras. The per-activity breakdown and table add useful structure not contradicting the ground truth's catalogue-style list. The conditional note for **AuditTrail** aligns perfectly. No deductions here, but it doesn't compensate for the decision-point flaws.

- **Overall Fidelity and Adherence (Minor Issues, -1.5 points):** The LLM adheres to the prompt by avoiding undefined activities (e.g., correctly notes the non-existence of "CustomerService_Agent_Decide"). Key notes reinforce constraints accurately. However, the summary table introduces the decision as pseudo-"activities" (e.g., separate rows for YES/NO branches), which borders on over-structuring without adding undefined elements but deviates from the ground truth's cleaner table format. Strictness penalizes this as unnecessary embellishment. Response is concise but incomplete, ignoring implicit decisions evident in the process flow.

- **Strictness Adjustment:** Per instructions, even implicit errors (e.g., under-identifying decisions from logical inference in the description) warrant significant loss. Starting from a neutral 5.0, deductions total -5.5, yielding 3.5. No upward adjustment for partial accuracy, as the core task (every decision point) is substantially unmet.
