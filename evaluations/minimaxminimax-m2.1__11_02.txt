**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities as ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), prioritized similarly by key metrics (wait time, rework/SLA for Request; SLA/processing/stdev for Review; upstream wait/SLA for Initial). Explanations tie directly to table metrics (e.g., 150 min wait, 22% rework, 12.4% SLA). Memo format is professional, concise (~180 words), and ≤200 words. Recommendations are mostly concrete and data-driven.
- **Major Deductions (-2.8 total)**:
  - **Factual errors** (-1.5): "8× higher than any other activity" for wait time is wrong—150 min is ~5× the next highest (Review_Documents' 30 min), not 8×. "12× the process average" for rework is incorrect—even if computing average (~3.5%), it's ~6×, and table provides no "process average," violating "strictly on the table."
  - **Violates "one concrete action"** (-0.8): Request_Documents rec lists *two* actions (checklists + parallelize). Initial_Assessment rec is vague/investigative ("conduct analysis... adjust staffing"), not as direct/measurable as ground truth.
  - **Minor omissions/diffs** (-0.5): Ignores throughput drop (190/day, highlighted in ground truth); no overall impact projection; less punchy (no bolded metrics like ground truth).
- **Why not lower?** Core task met (ID, explain, rec); no hallucinations of absent data/activities. But strict rubric demands zero errors—factual inaccuracies and rule slips prevent >8.0.
