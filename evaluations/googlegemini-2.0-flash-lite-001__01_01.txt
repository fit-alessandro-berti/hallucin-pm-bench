### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiency, ~30% Alignment)**: The ground truth identifies three distinct decision points with explicit branching logic and outcomes (eligibility triage, amount threshold, and final approval/rejection). The LLM answer only covers one (the amount threshold/high-value branch), omitting the eligibility check in triage (which implicitly decides continuation vs. rejection) and the final approval step (tied to pre-approval and auditor review, per constraints). It incorrectly frames this as the singular "core" decision point, underrepresenting the process flow. This is a critical incompleteness for "every decision point," warranting severe deduction under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Alignment, ~90% Alignment)**: The list matches the ground truth exactly in content and count (7 items), including the conditional note for *AuditTrail*. Minor formatting differences (bullet list vs. numbered) are negligible, but the LLM's phrasing ("only for high-value claims") aligns well without introducing extras. No violations of the "do not introduce" rule.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: The response is concise and on-topic but fails to fully summarize the process as prompted, leading to a low holistic score. No hallucinations, but omissions equate to significant errors in a strict evaluation.
