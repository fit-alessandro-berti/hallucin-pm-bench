**Justification:**

- **Decision Points**: The LLM answer identifies only one explicit decision point ("High-value branch"), overlooking the *eligibility check* at Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility and the *final payment approval* (which could result in rejection). The ground truth defines three decision points, each with its own outcomes. The LLM answer lacks two of them, which is a significant omission.

- **Required Documents**: The document list is almost correct and complete, with all required artifacts listed. However, the LLM answer does not clarify that *AuditTrail* is only for high-value claims, nor does it indicate that it is still part of the overall document catalogue (as specified in the ground truth).

- **Other minor issues**:
  - The decision point summary lacks explicit "branching logic or outcomes".
  - The answer does not explicitly avoid introducing legacy or undefined activities, but does not directly violate that instruction.

Given that two out of three decision points were omitted and there is less clarity on some document constraints (e.g., AuditTrail's conditionality and inclusion), this merits a significant penalty, but not a failing grade since no incorrect information is introduced and the document list itself is accurate.
