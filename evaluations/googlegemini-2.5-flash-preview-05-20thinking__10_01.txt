6.0

**Justification:**

- **Terminology (Full Marks):**
  - The LLM answer **correctly uses** the mandated synonyms: “KYC Review,” “Order Vetting,” and “Payment Clearance”. There are **no forbidden terms**.
- **Structure/Presentation (No Deductions):**
  - The RACI matrix structure matches the requirements, with activities as rows and roles as columns.
- **Major Errors (Significant Point Loss):**
  - **RACI Notation Not Strictly Followed:**
    - Uses “R, A” in a single cell (and similar for others)—this is **not standard practice**; the ground truth uses “R/A”, but the double designation itself is questionable (should be separate columns, or “R” with “A” below or alongside). However, this is a minor convention issue and would not alone warrant a huge deduction.
  - **Incorrect RACI Assignments** (Major Issue!):
    - The ground truth provides specific assignments:
      - e.g., for “Receive Application”: AM = R/A, CO = C, FC = I, IT = I
    - LLM omits correct C and I roles: For “Receive Application”, it gives only “R, A” for AM; the other roles are left blank (should have had C and I assignments).
    - For almost all activities, only R/A (or R, A), and sometimes I, are assigned—**most “C” (Consulted) and “I” (Informed) roles are missing or incorrect**.
    - For “KYC Review”, the ground truth assigns AM as A, CO as R, FC as C, IT as I; LLM shows AM as I (should be A), CO as R, A; FC as I (should be C); IT is blank (should be I).
    - Similar issues for other rows—the matrix misses both C and I assignments and, in several cases, assigns the wrong codes to the wrong roles.
- **Comprehensiveness (Major Issue):**
  - The answer does **not fully represent the involvement of all roles** in the process as required by the ground truth.
  - Several roles’ participation or notification statuses are not acknowledged.

**Summary:**  
The LLM gets full marks for *strict adherence to the forbidden terminology policy* and delivers a well-formatted table. However, it loses **a substantial number of points for failing to accurately and completely assign RACI codes per the process context and ground truth**—especially for omitting “C” and “I” roles and for mismatches in responsibility/accountability. These are critical in process mapping and should be exact.

**Thus, a 6.0 is a strict, fair reflection of an answer that's strong on terminology but has serious accuracy and completeness gaps in role allocations.**
