The LLM answer matches perfectly on Q1 (exact count of 1). For Q2, it correctly identifies the small sample size (3 cases, one day) and sampling bias leading to over/underestimation but diverges significantly: it quantifies frequency per case (33%) rather than per event (~7% as in ground truth), omits the critical point on near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing string-matching confusion, neglects event count (14) and time span (<2 hours), and introduces mild speculation on business rules/fraud patterns/clustering not strictly data-derived. While under 120 words and logically sound, these omissions and differences reduce fidelity to ground truth, warranting a deduction for strictness.
