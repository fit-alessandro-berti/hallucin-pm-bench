**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses **Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring** exactly as mandated, with no disallowed synonyms leaking (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", etc.). This matches ground truth and policy.
- **Activity coverage (-3.0)**: Adds unauthorized activities ("Escalation (>70)", "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification") and omits/reinterprets key ones (no "Compliance Officer Approval"; splits "Release Funds" differently). Violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities". Ground truth has precisely 6 activities; LLM has 8 mismatched ones.
- **RACI assignments (-2.5)**: Major inaccuracies across all rows:
  | Activity (GT) | GT Assignments | LLM Mismatch |
  |---------------|----------------|--------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Front **R,A**; Analyst C; Treasury I | Front R only (misses A, C); no Analyst C |
  | KYC Review | Analyst **R,A**; Officer C; Treasury I | Analyst R only (misses A); Officer A (wrong); misses C/I |
  | AML Screening | Analyst **R,A**; Officer C; Treasury I | Same as KYC (wrong A/C/I) |
  | Risk Scoring | Front C; Analyst R; Officer **A**; Treasury I | Analyst R + Officer A (misses Front C, Treasury I) |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | Front I; Analyst C; Officer **R,A** | Omitted; partial "Escalation" mismatch |
  | Release Funds | Front I; Analyst/Officer C; Treasury **R,A** | Split into wrong rows/assignments (Treasury R only, no C/I/A) |
  - No Notification row in GT; LLM adds it incorrectly.
- **Formatting (-1.5)**: No dashes (–) for no involvement (uses blanks); no bolding of key R/A cells; adds extraneous "Key" section (not in prompt or GT); "(>70)" descriptive leak.
- **Overall fidelity**: ~25% alignment (vocab + basic table structure); extensive deviations in interpretation, coverage, and precision justify minimal score under "utmost strictness" (small errors = significant loss; here, wholesale errors).
