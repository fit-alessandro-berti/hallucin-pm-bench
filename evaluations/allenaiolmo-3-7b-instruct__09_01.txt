**9.2**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth: both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed due to absent timestamps/durations, provide a brief explanation matching the prompt's Q2, and adhere to the system instruction. Minor deductions for: (1) imprecise phrasing "a unique case ID per row" (case IDs repeat across events per case, as shown in the log—factual error); (2) slight terminology variance ("derived" vs. "computed"; "cycle time...in its context" vs. exact "cycle time...no temporal value per event"); (3) unnecessary elaboration on "aggregate durations across cases" not in ground truth. These are small but warrant strict point loss per instructions.
