3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Correctness (Major Failure: -4.0)**: #1 and #2 activities/numbers correct (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter). #3 **wrong** (Initial_Screening at 2.1h vs. correct Assess_Liability at 7.8h). Fails "strictly by waiting-time" ranking. Numbers quoted verbatim for picked activities, but irrelevant due to error.
- **No Unwarranted Content (Pass: +1.0)**: No service-time, throughput, or extra activities mentioned.
- **Action Relevance (Partial: +1.5)**: Logically tied to waiting times; claims ≥20% cut. But **not data-driven** (vague "implement... reducing by 20% or more"; no pilots, estimates, or table-derived evidence like ground truth).
- **Format/Constraints (Partial: +1.0)**: Memo-like (~140 words, ≤150). Crisp but bloated with pleasantries/subject/sign-off vs. ground truth's ultra-concise list. Ranks #1→#3 correctly structured.
- **Overall Fidelity to Ground Truth/Prompt (Low: Base 2.0 + partials)**: Core ranking error dominates; generic actions miss "data-driven"; style less executive-crisp.

Total reflects utmost strictness: wrong #3 alone warrants <5.0; minor positives prevent 1.0.
