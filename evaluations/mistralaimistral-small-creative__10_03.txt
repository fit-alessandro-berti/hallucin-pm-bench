**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance**: Perfect (10/10). Uses exactly "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring"; no leaks of forbidden terms.
- **Format**: Markdown table present (partial credit), but includes unauthorized intro text ("Here is...") and post-table "Key" explanation, violating "Return the matrix as a Markdown table" (major deduction).
- **Activities**: Severe violations (-8 points total):
  - Covers only 4/6 ground truth activities correctly named; adds 3 unauthorized extras ("Escalation (Score > 70)", "Payment Release", "Notification") instead of "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds".
  - Renames/splits narrative elements (e.g., "escalate for Compliance Officer approval" → "Escalation"; "releases...notifies" → separate rows), directly breaking "do not rename, merge, or add activities".
- **RACI assignments**: Near-total mismatch (1-2/4 roles correct per row on average; no "R, A" combinations; uses "I" where GT has "–"):
  | Activity (GT) | Matching cells | Issues |
  |---------------|----------------|--------|
  | Intake Vetting | 2/4 (Comp Analyst C, Treasury I) | Front: R vs **R,A**; CO: I vs – |
  | KYC Review | 1/4 (Treasury I) | Front: I vs –; Comp Analyst: R vs **R,A**; CO: A vs C |
  | AML Screening | 1/4 (Treasury I) | Identical issues as KYC |
  | Risk Scoring | 3/4 | Front: I vs C |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | N/A (missing) | LLM "Escalation" mismatches entirely (e.g., CO R vs **R,A**; Treasury C vs –) |
  | Release Funds | N/A (partial in extras) | LLM splits/mismatches (e.g., no **R,A** for Treasury; extra C/I wrong) |
- **Other**: No bolding on R,A cells; arbitrary assignments (e.g., Treasury C on "Escalation"); fails to cover "every activity...described above" accurately.
- **Overall**: ~20% alignment despite vocab/format basics; multiple rule breaks warrant severe penalty under "utmost strictness".
