7.5

a) Decision Points:
The LLM correctly captures both main decision points:  
- The conditional risk/amount branch (step 4) is described with correct logic (“If Tri-Color Risk Check is Low/Medium and amount ≤ €250,000, skip manual underwriting”)—this matches the ground truth almost word-for-word.  
- The TriVote gate is described accurately, though its phrase “all three roles…must review…and any two approvals out of three are sufficient” could be improved by specifying that only *approvals* (not merely “review”) are counted, and the loan cannot pass unless at least two *actual* approvals are recorded; however, the practical meaning is not lost.

Still, the LLM says “all three roles…must review”—while the process says all must participate, but only two must approve—this causes a small drop in score.  
The logic of “otherwise, the application proceeds to manual underwriting” is fine.  
No extraneous or missing decision points.

b) Required Documents:
- The LLM’s document list is complete and in the correct order, except it merges “Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow” as a single bullet, while the ground truth requires them listed as distinct items.  
- It also slightly conflates “Signed Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration” as a single bullet (step 5 in its list), while the ground truth lists these separately at steps 7 and 8.
- No hallucinations are present (no mention of KYC, AML, or credit-bureau reports).

These grouping errors show minor but real departures from the strict literal requirements of the prompt and ground truth, particularly on the enumeration of documents.

Therefore, due to these small but cumulative points of inaccuracy (grouped documents instead of strict itemization, and slightly imprecise wording in decision point 2), the strict score is:

**7.5**
