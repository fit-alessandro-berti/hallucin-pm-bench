4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer with utmost strictness against the ground truth, penalizing even minor deviations in precision, structure, and completeness. The score reflects strong alignment in part (a) but significant flaws in part (b), dragging the overall score down.

- **Part (a) - Decision Points (7.0/10)**:  
  This section is mostly accurate but incurs point loss for slight inconsistencies in phrasing and added details not in the ground truth.  
  - Point 1: Closely matches the rule ("Low or Medium risk and ... ≤ €250 000" to skip step 5), but uses "at most €250,000" (minor formatting difference) and "otherwise, the application proceeds to manual underwriting" (accurate but wordier than ground truth's concise "otherwise it proceeds to that review"). No major error, but not identical.  
  - Point 2: Captures the core rule ("any two approvals out of the three are sufficient"), aligning with "at least two ... record 'Approve.'" However, it adds ungrounded details like "all three roles ... must review the case" (process implies participation but doesn't specify "review the case"), deviating from ground truth's precise focus on approvals. Labeling as "TriVote Approval (Step 6)" is extra structure not in ground truth.  
  Overall for (a): Good coverage of both points in one sentence each, but verbosity and additions reduce precision.

- **Part (b) - Documents List (2.0/10)**:  
  This has critical incompleteness and structural errors, treated as major failures under strict criteria.  
  - The ground truth requires a complete list of **all** documents in first-appearance order, with each as a separate item (9 total, including the three distinct Scorecards and the two in step 8).  
  - LLM incorrectly groups items: treats the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) as one bullet (missing their separation and order), and combines "Signed Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration" into one bullet (treating two distinct documents as one). This results in only 6 items instead of 9, omitting proper granularity.  
  - Added descriptive parentheses (e.g., "(collected at application receipt in Step 1)") introduce extraneous details not in the ground truth's simple list format.  
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), which avoids further deduction, but the list is fundamentally incomplete and unordered within groups. Even small grouping errors are penalized heavily as they alter the "all documents ... in the order" requirement.

- **Overall Structure and Extras (-1.0 adjustment)**: The LLM's formatting (e.g., dashed lines, introductory sentence, closing summary) adds unnecessary elements not present in the ground truth's clean, direct response. This deviates from a pure match.

The combined score averages the strengths in (a) with the weaknesses in (b), resulting in 4.5. A perfect match would require identical phrasing, separation, and conciseness.
