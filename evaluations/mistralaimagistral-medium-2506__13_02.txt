The LLM answer is highly accurate on questions 1 and 2 (perfect match to ground truth numerics and calculations, with proper rounding). For question 3, it stays within 100 words, adheres to the log (references the single occurrence in C05 and its faster approval timeline), and covers the required elements: single-occurrence/rare issue (via "low-support" and "rare occurrence"), variance/instability (risk of dismissal as noise biasing predictions), and caution against generalization (explicitly notes misleading if generalizing from this slice). However, minor deduction for slight overreach in hypothesizing "delay risks" as an example of impact, which isn't evidenced in the log's single instance (where processing is expedited, not delayed)â€”this borders on inventing unsubstantiated detail, per the "do not invent" rule, though it's framed as potential rather than factual.
