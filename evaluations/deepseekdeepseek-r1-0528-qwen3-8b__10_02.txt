3.0

**Evaluation and justification:**

- "Operations Manager" is **omitted** entirely from the LLM answer, though it is *clearly* present and "Accountable" for several steps in the ground truth. This is a major omission.
- The LLM introduces extra tasks ("Initiate Transaction Processing", "Verify source and beneficiary details", "Provide Input to KYC Review", etc.) and splits others, which are not directly present in the source. This makes mapping to the ground truth impossible and violates the instruction to "cover every task" as per the description.
- The roles "Responsible," "Accountable," etc. are not always clearly ascribed on a one-to-one basis per the source steps. Lines such as "Archive Transaction File" incorrectly assign responsibility to the "Transaction Analyst" (should be "IT Support").
- The "KYC Review" terminology is often used as an action for "Regulatory Liaison" but not structured as a single line as in ground truth. Some steps assign Regulatory Liaison as both R and A, which is not accurate and does not reflect ground truth's distinct separation between these roles.
- There's *no clear mapping* of these steps to the specific steps provided in the source or ground truth, making it **hard to verify correctness**.
- The inclusion of steps like "Notify Regulatory Liaison of Completion" and "Confirm Transaction Status Changes" are not present in the source or ground truth.
- The instruction to use "**only**" mandated vocabulary is partially met, though tasks like "Dispatch Payment and Send SWIFT Message" stray from the concise, direct task naming of the ground truth.
- Consultation and information flows differ from ground truth (for example, IT Support is assigned as "Consulted" on SWIFT transmission rather than "Responsible" for archiving as in the ground truth).

**Conclusion**:  
The output only partly uses the mandated language and fails to include all roles/tasks as explicitly required (notably, omitting "Operations Manager"), adds extra tasks, and presents a structure misaligned with both the prompt and ground truth. These are critical departures, demanding a very strict score of **3.0** due to some terminological correctness but deep structural and content errors.
