3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") but fails significantly in structure, fidelity to the source text, and alignment with the ground truth. Key issues, evaluated strictly:

- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Major Deviation, -4.0 points)**: The source has 6 clear steps, which the ground truth maps concisely to 6 tasks without omission, addition, or splitting. The LLM invents extraneous tasks (e.g., "Initiate Transaction Processing", "Provide Input to KYC Review", "Confirm Regulatory Review Completion", "Confirm Transaction Status Changes") not in the source, splits "KYC Review" into separate sender/beneficiary rows (unnecessary and not in ground truth), and mishandles step 5 (combines release and SWIFT into "Dispatch...Message" with a sub-row). Step 6's archiving is incorrectly assigned to Transaction Analyst (source/IT Support) instead of IT Support. Notification of Regulatory Liaison is added as a separate row but not integrated as in ground truth's "I" columns. This bloats the table (12+ rows vs. ground truth's 6) and omits direct mappings like "Receive Payment Instruction" or "Screen Against Sanctions List".

- **Roles and RACI Assignments (Major Deviation, -2.0 points)**: Omits "Operations Manager" entirely, which is central to ground truth's accountability (A) across all tasks. Assignments differ substantially (e.g., KYC Review: LLM has R/A=Regulatory Liaison, C=Transaction Analyst; ground truth has C=Transaction Analyst, R=Regulatory Liaison, A=Operations Manager, I=IT Support). Archiving is wrongly R=Transaction Analyst in LLM vs. R=IT Support in ground truth. Empty cells and inconsistent use of IT Support (e.g., consulted in dispatch but not informed where ground truth has I) reduce clarity. No legend provided, unlike ground truth.

- **Table Structure and Clarity (Moderate Deviation, -0.5 points)**: Markdown table is functional but poorly organized with empty sub-rows (e.g., under "Initiate" and "Dispatch"), making it unclear and non-standard. Title is added but not required. Ground truth is clean, with bolded R/A/C/I and a legend for readability.

Minor positives (+0.5 for vocabulary use) are outweighed by these errors, resulting in low fidelity. A perfect match would score 10.0; this is a loose, inaccurate interpretation.
