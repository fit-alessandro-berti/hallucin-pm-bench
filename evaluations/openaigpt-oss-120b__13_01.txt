9.8

The LLM answer is nearly flawless in fidelity to the ground truth, with exact matches on questions 1–3 (minor phrasing variations in Q1 and Q3, such as "1 time" vs. "1 occurrence" and omission of "only" in Q3, are negligible but warrant a tiny deduction under strict criteria). For Q4, both reasons are clearly stated, directly sampling-related (small/non-representative sample aligns with "small sample size" and "temporal bias"; selection/incomplete coverage aligns with "case-mix bias" and "survivorship/truncation bias"), and derived solely from the log without hallucination—full credit here, but the overall score reflects utmost strictness on phrasing.
