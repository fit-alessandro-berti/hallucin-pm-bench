9.5

**Evaluation and Justification**:

- **Q1:** Perfect. States "1" occurrence.
- **Q2:** Perfect. Calculation is correct and prescription to round to two decimals is followed.
- **Q3:** Perfect. Only A1002 is named.
- **Q4:** The two reasons given map closely to the allowed ground-truth answers:
    - "Tiny and non-representative sample" covers both small sample size and temporal bias, mentioning both high error due to low size and limitation to a single day.
    - "Selection bias / incomplete coverage" closely tracks with case-mix bias and overall incompleteness.
    
There is a small deduction because "Selection bias / incomplete coverage" is slightly less precise than calling out specific biases (case-mix, survivorship), but it does not introduce inappropriate reasoning or error given the context. No unjustified inference, and all responses flow only from the log lines.

**Summary:**  
Nearly ideal; a minuscule precision issue for the type of bias cited in reason 2, but it does not constitute an errorâ€”just a slightly less specific term. Thus, 9.5/10.
