**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correct pairs**: Only 1 fully correct (`Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines`). The second parallel pair is listed as `Quality_Check — Create_Documentation` (reversed alphabetical order within pair; should be `Create_Documentation — Quality_Check`).
- **Incorrect pairs**: Includes 2 invalid pairs (`Create_Work_Order — Procure_Materials`, `Create_Work_Order — Schedule_Machines`). These cannot run in parallel, as `Procure_Materials`/`Schedule_Machines` start *after* `Create_Work_Order` completes.
- **Format violations**: Extra explanatory text (multiple paragraphs, bolding, notes like "Package — (no parallel...)"); not a pure "one pair per line" list. Inconsistent spacing/alignment vs. ground truth/prompt.
- **Ordering issues**: Overall list not strictly alphabetical due to invalid pairs; within-pair error on one correct pair.
- **Completeness**: Over-includes (4 vs. 2), misinterprets "may start immediately after... and may run simultaneously" as parallel *with* predecessor.
- **Strict penalty**: Major factual errors (extra pairs), format failure, and ordering mistake warrant severe deduction; partial recognition of parallel groups prevents 1.0.
