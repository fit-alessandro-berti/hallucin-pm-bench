The LLM answer matches the ground truth diff exactly—both propose tightening the Collect Equipment due date from 5 days to 2 days. The unified diff is correct and minimal, and the change strictly complies with the rules (modifying only an attribute of an existing element).

The rationale is also sound: it clearly identifies that reducing the due date removes a bottleneck, improves SLA compliance, and does so without altering the process structure.

However, the LLM’s rationale, while correct, is less precise than the ground truth in referencing the specific contractual 3-day SLA and could have been slightly clearer on the SLA details. This small omission in specificity (not mentioning “keeps the overall onboarding cycle inside the contractual 3-day SLA”) warrants a minor deduction.

**Overall: Excellent answer, minor loss for lack of explicit reference to the 3-day SLA constraint.**
