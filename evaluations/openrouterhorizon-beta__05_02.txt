8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Diff Accuracy (Core Change)**: The proposed modification to `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" for `Task_CollectEquipment` is identical to the ground truth, correctly targeting the longest due date without adding/deleting elements or altering flow. This earns full credit for substance (+5/5).
- **Diff Format**: The content matches, but the LLM uses a non-standard patch format with extraneous lines (e.g., "*** Begin Patch", "Update File", "*** End Patch") and a single @@ hunk without proper ---/+++ headers or markdown ```diff``` block. The ground truth is a clean, precise unified diff hunk in markdown. This is a noticeable formatting deviation, warranting a deduction (-1.0).
- **Rationale Quality**: Both are single sentences justifying the change without new activities. The LLM's explanation (bottleneck reduction, cycle time) is logical and aligned but omits the specific "3-day SLA" reference and lacks bolding for emphasis. The ground truth ties directly to contractual compliance. Minor wording/content differences reduce points slightly (-0.5).
- **Overall Adherence to Rules/Prompt**: Fully complies with proposing exactly one improvement, no additions/deletions, and XML attribute modification. Strict evaluation notes small polish issues but recognizes high fidelity to the intent.

Total: 8.5/10.0 â€“ Excellent core solution with minor formatting and phrasing inconsistencies.
