**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.5)**: Correctly uses **Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring** exactly as mandated in rows 1-4. No disallowed synonyms leak. However, other activities renamed/altered ("Compliance Officer approval" vs. **Compliance Officer Approval**; verbose "Release the funds..." vs. **Release Funds**; added unmerged "Schedule the payment").
- **Activities coverage (major deductions, -3.0)**: Prompt requires **every activity** without renaming, merging, or adding. LLM adds 7th row ("Schedule the payment"), splits/merges narrative imprecisely (narrative has distinct "schedule" for low-risk, "release and notify" post-approval), mismatching ground truth's exact 6 activities/names. Significant violation.
- **RACI assignments (severe mismatches, -3.5)**: Near-total divergence per cell (strict cell-by-cell):
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Comp Analyst: I vs. **C**; Treasury: blank vs. I |
  | KYC Review | Front: C vs. –; Comp: R vs. **R,A**; Officer: A vs. C |
  | AML Screening | Identical mismatches as KYC Review |
  | Risk Scoring | Front: I vs. C (others partial) |
  | Compliance Officer approval | All cells wrong vs. GT (e.g., Treasury: I vs. –; Officer R/A partial but format wrong) |
  | Schedule the payment | Non-existent in GT (added) |
  | Release... | Non-matching name; Comp/Officer: I vs. C; partial Treasury R/A |
  ~80% cells incorrect.
- **Formatting (deductions, -1.0)**: No **bold** on activities/R,A; "R/A" vs. **R, A** (no comma/space); blanks vs. –; minor header/alignment issues.
- **Overall**: Major structural/content errors outweigh vocab win. Strict policy demands near-exact GT match; small errors (e.g., I vs. C, blanks vs. –) incur outsized penalties. Unfit for process-governance use.
