9.0

The LLM answer is almost fully aligned with the ground truth, including correct verdict ("No"), clear justification, and referencing each rule individually. It correctly identifies which rules are satisfied or violated. 

Minor deduction is warranted because:
- The tabular layout and explicit "non-compliant" conclusion in the ground truth provide slightly more clarity and structure.
- The LLM's explanation under Rule 4 could more directly reference that the relative order for VP is only required "if applicable," but this is a subtle point.

Overall, no substantive errors are present, but some structural/detail differences compared to the gold standard merit a minor penalty.
