8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact IDs, names, and gateway type shifts, matching the ground truth content verbatim. No additions, omissions, guesses, or commentary violate the prompt. However, under utmost strictness, deduct points for formatting differences vs. ground truth: bolded headings (3 instances), missing bullet points (-) before all 5 items, extra blank lines after headings, and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway line. These are small but multiple visual/string mismatches, warranting deduction from 10.0.
