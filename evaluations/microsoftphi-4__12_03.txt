7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides relevant counterexamples (C002 and C004) with accurate activity sequences and timestamps, effectively disproving the "always" claim. However, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits Case C003 entirely, despite this case supporting the fact (Receive_Order immediately followed by Validate_Payment), which the ground truth systematically covers in all four cases for thoroughness. Additionally, the phrasing for C001 is awkwardly confusing ("fits the pattern, it is not the issue"), unnecessarily including a supporting case without clear purpose, and the overall structure lacks the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case table, making it less precise and balanced. These omissions and minor clarity issues deduct 2.5 points under strict evaluation criteria.
