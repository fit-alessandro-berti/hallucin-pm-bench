The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall verdict (**No**) and accurately cites Cases C002 and C004 as violations, providing their relevant activity sequences and timestamps. However, there are a few notable omissions and small issues that warrant a substantial deduction:

- The answer does not mention Case C003 at all. Including all cases (even those conforming) better demonstrates a meticulous justification and fully matches the ground truth answer.
- The justification for Case C001 is slightly unclear, as it suggests the case “fits the pattern” and is “not the issue,” but should have been more explicit for completeness—clearly showing which cases support the fact and which do not, as in the table from the ground truth.
- The answer omits a summary quantification (e.g., “two out of four cases violate the rule”) and more structured, systematic comparison as in the table format from the ground truth.

While the main logic and evidence are correct and the necessary counterexamples are cited with correct activity order, the missing reference to C003 and less precise structure cost it two full points—especially given the requested level of strictness.
