1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on both questions, directly contradicting the ground truth. It wrongly concludes "No" for Q1, ignoring the alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) that enables P5's token without T3 firing, while P2 retains its token for T5. The explanation misstates T3 as the only way to reach P4, overlooking T7's role, and fails to provide a valid sequence or proper justification. This represents a complete misunderstanding of the Petri net structure, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
