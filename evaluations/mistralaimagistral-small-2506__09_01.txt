9.5

The LLM answer is essentially correct and provides a thorough, precise explanation: it states unequivocally that the cycle time cannot be computed, accurately citing the absence of necessary data (elapsed times, timestamps) and clarifies that historical benchmarks cannot be used as a substitute. It also directly answers both user sub-questions in accordance with the system instructions and matches the reasoning in the ground truth.

There is only a tiny difference in tone and emphasis: the LLM answer says “Data unavailable for ‘Review Contract’ in the log” (a bit brief) but then immediately provides a correct detailed explanation; the ground truth stresses both the absence of any time fields and that fabricated numbers would be unjustified. The distinction is extremely minimal and does not affect substance.

With strictness applied, this very minor stylistic difference prevents a perfect 10, so 9.5 is the appropriate score.
