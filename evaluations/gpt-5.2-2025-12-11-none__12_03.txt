**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and adheres strictly to the task: correct "No" verdict; cites all relevant CaseIDs (C001–C004) with precise activity sequences from the log; correctly identifies supporting cases (C001, C003) and counterexamples (C002, C004) with exact intervening activities; relies solely on log evidence. Substance matches ground truth perfectly (same cases, sequences, violations, conclusion). Minor stylistic differences (bullets vs. table, case order, emphasis) are irrelevant under task instructions and introduce no errors or omissions.
