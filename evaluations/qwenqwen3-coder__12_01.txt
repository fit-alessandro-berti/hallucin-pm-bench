6.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides accurate evidence for Cases 1001 and 1003, showing the reversed sequence (Update_Inventory before Authorize_Refund) with timestamps for precision. It cites case IDs and activities as required, and the overall structure is clear and evidence-based.

However, under strict evaluation, there are significant flaws:
- **Incomplete handling of Case 1002**: The LLM incorrectly states that the absence of Update_Inventory "cannot be used to support or refute the claim." This is a critical error. The universal "always" claim requires Authorize_Refund to be immediately followed by Update_Inventory in *every* case where Authorize_Refund occurs. In Case 1002, Authorize_Refund is followed by Refund_Issued without any Update_Inventory, directly refuting the claim (as the ground truth explicitly notes). Dismissing this as non-refuting undermines the justification and misses a core disproof element, violating the "meticulous" and "strictly on the data" instruction.
- **Missed comprehensive conclusion**: The ground truth emphasizes that the sequence fails "in none of the three cases," explicitly including Case 1002's absence. The LLM's conclusion focuses only on the "opposite sequence" in cases with both activities, ignoring how the absence independently falsifies "always immediately before."
- **Minor issues**: The response is slightly longer than the "short justification" requested, though still concise. No fabrication or guessing, but the reasoning gap on universality reduces completeness.

These errors (especially the refutation oversight) warrant a substantial deduction from a potential 10.0, as they alter the logical strength of the justification compared to the ground truth.
