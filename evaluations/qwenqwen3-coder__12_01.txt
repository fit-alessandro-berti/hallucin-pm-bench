9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the fact is inaccurate, and provides an evidence-based justification using the activity sequences for cases 1001 and 1003. It accurately notes that "Update_Inventory" appears before "Authorize_Refund" in these cases, thus the claimed order is reversed. It also correctly mentions that case 1002 does not contain "Update_Inventory" and so cannot be used to support or refute the claim.

However, there is a slight shortfall in strictness and clarity compared to the ground truth answer:

- The LLM says, "in both cases where both activities occur," which could be more explicit in stating that there are no cases where "Authorize_Refund" immediately precedes "Update_Inventory."
- It does not as explicitly state that the "always" is already disproved simply by an absence of "Update_Inventory" in one case.
- The LLM's phrasing "do not support" is slightly weaker than the ground truth's categorical rejection ("statement is false").
- Minor wording differences ("opposite sequence for relevant cases") reduce the level of directness.

These are small but real differences that, per the instruction, should lead to a significant but not extreme deduction. Thus, 9.0.
