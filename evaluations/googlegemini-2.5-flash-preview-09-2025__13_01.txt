The LLM answer accurately addresses all four questions with no deviations from the ground truth in content, calculations, or reasoning. It derives all information solely from the provided log lines without hallucinations or unjustified inferences. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., not explicitly saying "only" in Q3, or elaborating slightly on temporal aspects in Q4 without adding unsubstantiated details) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as the core facts and suggested reasons align perfectly.
