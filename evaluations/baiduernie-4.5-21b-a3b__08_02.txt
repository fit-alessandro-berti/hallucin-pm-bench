The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1, claiming "No" when the ground truth is "Yes," due to a misunderstanding of the Petri net paths (T5 does not depend on T3; P5 can be reached via T1-T2-T7-T4 while leaving P2's token available for T5). This invalidates Q2 entirely. No credit for explanation or structure, as the core analysis is reversed and erroneous.
