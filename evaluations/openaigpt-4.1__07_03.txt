7.0

The LLM answer covers all functional changes present in the ground truth: the correct tasks and gateway changes are listed in the correct groups. However, there are several formatting/correctness issues that must be penalized, including:

- Task listing style: The LLM answer omits the leading dash/hyphen before each task (as required by the ground truth).
- Gateway change listing style: The LLM answer omits the leading dash/hyphen before each gateway change, and also omits the alignment spaces in "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel" in the ground truth.
- Task label: The LLM answer inconsistently uses "Task_" as a prefix for some tasks (e.g. "Task_FraudCheck") but no dash/hyphen as per the ground truth ("- Task_FraudCheck ...").
- Headings: The LLM answer uses headings as required and in the correct order.
- The content for each change is correct and fully complete.

Because precision and adherence to required output formatting are critical in strict change analysis (as per prompt), these formatting deviations result in heavy penalties. Thus, the score is 7.0.
