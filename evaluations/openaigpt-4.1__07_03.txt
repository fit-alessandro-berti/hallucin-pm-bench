The LLM answer accurately identifies all functional changes: three tasks added (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), one task removed (Task_ManualReview), and two gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). No extraneous content, commentary, or unchanged elements are mentioned, fully adhering to the prompt's constraints. The only minor differences from the ground truth are the absence of bullet points (-) before each item and lack of alignment spacing in the gateway section, which are presentational rather than substantive. Under utmost strictness, this results in a small deduction (0.5 points) for not matching the exact listing format.
