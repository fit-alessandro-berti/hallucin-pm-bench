9.0

• The LLM answer is well-structured and complete with respect to the three required headings.
• All added tasks, removed tasks, and the correct gateway-type change are identified, using both IDs and names.
• The note "(naming ignored, but type change noted)" inside the "Gateway-type changes" section is an unnecessary addition, and the phrase "Gateway_Decision renamed from 'Eligible?' to 'Eligibility Check'" constitutes an explicit reference to a name change, which the instructions say to explicitly ignore. This is an (albeit minor) compliance violation.
• Minor discrepancy: The answer numbers the ground truth items, while the LLM uses bullet points and parenthetical names, but this is stylistic and not content.
• No tasks are missing nor extra changes added.

Due to the small but explicit deviation from the instructions ("naming ignored" plus mentioning the renaming), I deduct a full point for strictness.

**Final score: 9.0**
