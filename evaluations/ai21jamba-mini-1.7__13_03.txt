**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1**: Critical factual error. The exact string “Manual Fraud Check” appears only once (CaseID 1002, 09:07:13Z). The LLM incorrectly claims two occurrences, fabricating a second in CaseID 1003 (which has “Fraud Check (Automatic)”). This violates the "strictly from the data" instruction and introduces a baseless count, warranting near-total deduction for this section.
- **Part 2**: The explanation (78 words) is superficial and flawed by relying on the erroneous count (e.g., false "even distribution across 1002 and 1003"). It vaguely mentions distribution and context but ignores key ground truth points: tiny sample size (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), extreme sampling error for rare events (e.g., 0-7% swing), wide confidence intervals, near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) risking matching errors, and need for larger/random samples. It speculates on "clusters" or "seasonal trends" without data support, reducing accuracy. Minor partial credit for noting missing context, but overall mismatches lead to low score.
