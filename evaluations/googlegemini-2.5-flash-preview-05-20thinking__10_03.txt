4.0

The LLM answer gets several important aspects correct but contains significant deviations from the ground truth:

**Positives:**
- Uses only the allowed terminology (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) exactly as specified.
- Sticks to the roles and activities without inventing synonyms or merging activities.

**Major Errors:**
1. **Extra Activities:** The answer introduces activities not in the ground truth—“Payment Scheduling”, “Fund Release”, and “Notification to Originating Analyst”—violating the instruction not to add activities.
2. **Missing activity:** “Release Funds” in the ground truth is relabeled as “Fund Release”. While the vocabulary policy only strictly applied to the four named activities, the ground truth uses “Release Funds”. This is a minor textual inconsistency but should incur a small penalty.
3. **Misassignments:** 
    - “Intake Vetting”: C incorrectly omitted for Compliance Analyst; I for Treasury Ops is missing.
    - “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”: C for Compliance Officer and I for Treasury Ops is missing.
    - “Risk Scoring”: Ground truth splits R (Compliance Analyst) and A (Compliance Officer); the submission lumps both into Compliance Analyst and only I for Treasury Ops.
    - “Compliance Officer Approval”: Accountabilities and consultancies do not match the ground truth (R,A on Compliance Officer ONLY).
    - “Release Funds”: The ground truth's allocation of C and I is missing, instead spread across extra activities.
4. **Incorrect RACI allocations:** Multiple matrix cells differ from the ground truth, both in missing roles and improper assignment of responsibilities, accountabilities, consulted, and informed statuses.
5. **Omitted dashes (–):** The original uses “–” for zero involvement, which the LLM skips, reducing clarity and explicitness.

**Conclusion:** 
While the LLM answer passes the strict vocabulary filter, the structural and mapping errors—especially adding unauthorized activities, omitting roles, and incorrect RACI allocations—result in a substantial penalty. Each deviation is significant, justifying a strict deduction.
