2.5

• **Added tasks**
The LLM answer fails to identify two added tasks: "Check Customer VIP Status" (`check_vip`) and "Generate RMA QR Code" (`generate_qr`). This is a significant omission and constitutes a major error.

• **Removed tasks**
Correctly identifies "send_rma_label" as removed, but does not mention its id (`send_rma_label`), which is a minor but important detail.

• **Gateway type changes**
The gateway change is reported and specifies the gateway id, which is correct. However, the formatting is inconsistent with the ground truth (the answer uses extra lines, and wording is less concise but the essential information is present).

**Summary of errors:**
- Completely omits the two added tasks. (-5 points minimum)
- Removed task does not include the id. (-0.5)
- Formatting and clarity are also lacking compared to ground truth. (-2)
- Does not state “(none)” for categories with no changes as required by the prompt, but since at least one item exists in each, this is not a large penalty here.

Final justification: Omission of "added tasks" is a critical fault. Some correct information is present, mostly near the "removed tasks" and "gateway type changes", but overall accuracy and completeness are severely lacking.

**Score:** 2.5
