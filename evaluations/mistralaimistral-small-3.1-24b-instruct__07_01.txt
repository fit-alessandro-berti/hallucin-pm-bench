3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (0/10)**: Completely incorrect and non-compliant. The LLM failed to identify the two added tasks (`check_vip` with name "Check Customer VIP Status" and `generate_qr` with name "Generate RMA QR Code"), instead providing a nonsensical and speculative response ("Unable to ferry any added elements"). This violates the core instruction to list factual differences from the XML without speculation. Ground truth explicitly lists both with IDs and names.
- **Removed tasks (4/10)**: Partially correct but incomplete and poorly formatted. It identifies the correct task ID (`send_rma_label`), but omits the name ("Send RMA Label") and the expected format (e.g., name with ID in backticks as in ground truth). Uses bullet with bold on ID only, not matching the structured list style.
- **Gateway type changes (6/10)**: Core change is accurate (from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway` for `gw_valid`), but includes unnecessary and verbose details (repeating ID and name, extra bullets/sub-bullets), which deviates from the concise ground truth format. Adds speculation-like elements not required (e.g., full name repetition).
- **Overall Compliance (3/10 aggregation)**: Headings use the required bullet style but add inconsistent bolding and substructure not in instructions or ground truth. No "(none)" usage needed here, but the response speculates and ignores key XML differences (e.g., inserted `check_vip` after `receive_request` and replacement of `send_rma_label` with `generate_qr`). Major factual omissions and format deviations warrant a low score under strict criteria; only partial credit for the detected removed task and gateway change prevents a 1.0.
