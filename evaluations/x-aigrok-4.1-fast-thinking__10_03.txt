**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses exact mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks. No violations here.
- **Activities (+0.2)**: Covers the 4 mandated activities (+); adds 4 unauthorized extras ("Compliance Officer approval", "Schedule the payment", "Releases the funds", "Notifies the originating analyst") vs. ground truth's exact 6. Renames/mismatches (e.g., "approval" vs. "**Compliance Officer Approval**"; "Releases the funds" vs. "**Release Funds**"; adds unmerged "Schedule" and "Notifies" absent in GT). Prompt forbids rename/merge/add.
- **RACI assignments (-5.0 major deduction)**: Fundamentally inaccurate across all rows vs. ground truth:
  | Activity | Key LLM Errors vs. GT |
  |----------|----------------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Misses Comp Analyst **C**, Treasury **I**; blanks ≠ **–**; Front "R/A" format wrong (should be **R, A**). |
  | KYC Review | Misses CO **C**, Treasury **I**; Front **–**. |
  | AML Screening | Misses CO **C**, Treasury **I**; Front **–**. |
  | Risk Scoring | Wrong: Comp "R/A" vs. Comp **R**, CO **A**, Front **C**, Treasury **I**. |
  | Compliance Officer approval | Misses Front **I**, Comp **C**; Treasury **–**; name/format mismatch. |
  | Schedule the payment | Unauthorized addition; no GT equivalent. |
  | Releases the funds | Wrong vs. **Release Funds**; misses Front **I**, Comp/CO **C**; format mismatch. |
  | Notifies... | Unauthorized; misplaced (Front **I**, Treasury **R**); no GT equivalent. |
- **Formatting (-1.2)**: No bolding (**); "R/A" ≠ "**R, A**"; blanks ≠ **–**; inconsistent capitalization (e.g., "approval"); extra rows disrupt; no exact GT structure.
- **Completeness/Coverage**: Fails to match "every activity and role described" per GT interpretation; over-adds, under-assigns roles (many blanks ignore C/I/–).
- **Overall**: ~70% deviation in content/structure; small errors (format, names) compound with major (assignments, extras) → severe penalty. Minimal credit for vocab/table skeleton.
