The LLM answer incorrectly attaches the timer to Task_RequestDocs, which starts only after completeness check and potential delays (e.g., from Task_Receive/Check), failing to measure 48 hours strictly from submission (post-Start_Claim/Task_Receive). This could exceed SLA if prior steps take >0 hours. Ground truth correctly attaches to Task_Receive for accurate timing from near-submission. LLM reuses elements without new tasks but misses SLA enforcement; minor positives (interrupting timer, flow to Triage, brevity) offset by core logical flaw. Strict deduction for inaccuracy.
