The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides an accurate, one-paragraph justification that cites relevant case IDs and line numbers, directly aligning with the ground truth's core counterexamples (C003's reversed order and C005's absence of Receive_Order). It adheres to the prompt's structure without factual errors. However, the inclusion of unnecessary positive examples from C001 and C004 introduces minor extraneous detail not present in the ground truth, warranting a small deduction for deviation from the concise focus on refutation.
