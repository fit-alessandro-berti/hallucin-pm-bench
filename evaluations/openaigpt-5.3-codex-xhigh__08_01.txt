The LLM answer is highly accurate and directly addresses the prompt with no factual errors, providing a correct "Yes", a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, precise full markings, and a brief justification matching the required enabling condition (p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0). It explicitly notes T3 can follow, aligning with reachability.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for stylistic/presentation differences from ground truth: 
- Lacks the ground truth's deeper insight ("must fire before T3 if it occurs" + inhibitor permanence explanation), though not required by prompt's "justify briefly".
- Shorter sequence (stops correctly at T5 vs. ground truth's erroneous extension to invalid T4 firing when p3=0).

Under utmost strictness, these non-identical elements (depth, length) warrant a small but significant point loss despite superior precision over ground truth's sequence flaw.
