**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Vocabulary Correctness (mandated terms)**: Perfect (10/10). Uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly; no forbidden terms. Activities match exactly.
- **Format & Structure**: Catastrophic failure (-8 pts). Not a proper RACI matrix/table (garbled ASCII with inconsistent | separators, no clear columns/cells, missing values everywhere). Ground truth is clean Markdown table with all cells populated. LLM is unreadable/incomplete.
- **RACI Allocations (Correctness vs. Narrative & Ground Truth)**: Almost entirely wrong/incomplete (1/10).
  | Activity          | LLM Issues (vs. Ground Truth) |
  |-------------------|-------------------------------|
  | Receive Application | Partial (RA ~ R/A for AM); misses CO=C, FC=I, IT=I. |
  | **KYC Review**    | Wrong (RA for FC?); should be CO=R, AM=A, etc. |
  | **Order Vetting** | Wrong (RA for CO?); should be AM=R/A. |
  | **Payment Clearance** | Wrong (RA for IT?); should be FC=R. |
  | Record Update     | Correct-ish (RA ~ R for IT); misses others. |
  | Notify Customer   | Wrong (RA for CO?); should be AM=R/A. |
  - No single Responsible per activity reflected accurately.
  - No full matrix (blanks ≠ C/I); ignores consultative/informed roles.
  - "RA" notation inconsistent with ground truth's **R/A** + separates.
- **Unwarranted Content**: None (0 deduction).
- **Overall**: Massive deviations in core deliverable (RACI logic/format). Vocab saves it from 1.0; strictness demands heavy penalty for errors/mismatches.
