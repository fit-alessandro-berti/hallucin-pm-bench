- The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all substantive points:
    - For (1), it correctly lists the 3 distinct cases.
    - For (2), it identifies "Pack_Items" as the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" in case C456, which is correct by timestamp order.
    - For (3), it identifies "Cancel_Order" as the only activity that appears exactly once, which is correct.

- The only minor difference: The ground truth uses slightly different formatting in answers (e.g., underscores in "Pack\_Items", not quoted, and answer labels like "**A1:**"), whereas the LLM encloses activity names in quotes and uses a numbered bullet list. These are purely stylistic and do not alter the content.

- To penalize even these small differences per instruction, deduct 0.2.
