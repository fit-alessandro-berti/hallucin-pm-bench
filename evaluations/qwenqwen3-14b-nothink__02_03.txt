The LLM answer is essentially identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and structure, with only negligible formatting variations (e.g., bullet style, numbering prefix, minor punctuation around lists and quotes) that do not affect correctness or conciseness. All three answers match precisely: distinct cases count and listing; preceding activity for C456; and unique activity. No errors or deviations.
