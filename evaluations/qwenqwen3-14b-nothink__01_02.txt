6.0

The LLM answer demonstrates some understanding of the required process and documentation, but makes notable errors and introduces inaccuracies that would not be acceptable under strict grading:

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM includes **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** and **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)** as "decision points," but per the ground truth, these are not decision points—they are process steps with no branching or judgment required; notably, the CIA is not a decision gate at all.
- The **Dual Underwriter Split** and the step where both underwriters assign scores is not itself a decision point; the decision only happens at the **Underwriter Alignment Gate**. The LLM's structure could confuse the step/sequencing.
- The LLM correctly lists the **Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision**, and **Final Micro-loan Board Approval** as decision points, which matches ground truth.
- “Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)” is listed as a decision point by the LLM, but it isn't a decisional branch—collecting references is a required process step, not a branch.
- The answer paraphrases certain gates (e.g., “if scores differ by >2 points...”), which could blur the strict process language required.

**Required Documents:**
- The document list is reproduced exactly and correctly. There are no errors here.

**Other:**
- The LLM answer sometimes introduces unnecessary process commentary (“No explicit decision point, but a prerequisite for underwriting”) that is not present in the ground truth and could confuse the user.
- The answer correctly does not introduce “standard retail loan” terminology.

**Summary:**  
- Main faults: Overinclusion of non-decision steps under “decision points,” some paraphrasing and extra process notes not requested, rather than giving the laser-focused list found in the ground truth.
- Document list is perfect.

Given the requirement for “utmost strictness,” the extra content and inclusion of non-decision steps merits a significant penalty. A 6.0 reflects that the responder got the right core areas but did not apply the required precision, especially for the decision points.
