9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Exact match to ground truth (5.56%, with correct calculation). No deduction.
- **Question 3**: Exact match to ground truth (only A1002). No deduction.
- **Question 4**: Partial match. The first reason ("Limited Time Span") closely aligns with the ground truth's "Temporal bias" (short time window on one day). However, the second reason ("Non-Random Sampling" due to chronological order) is a reasonable derivation from the log fragment but deviates from the ground truth's specified examples (e.g., it does not match "Small sample size," "Case-mix bias," or "Survivorship/truncation bias" directly). This introduces a minor deviation/inference not explicitly listed in the ideal responses, warranting a deduction under strict criteria for exact fidelity. Overall, both reasons are sampling-related and clear, but the lack of precise alignment costs 1.0 point.

The response adheres strictly to the provided log data without hallucination, but the slight mismatch in Q4 prevents a perfect score.
