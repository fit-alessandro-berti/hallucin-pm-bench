4.5

**Justification:**

### a) Decision Points

- **Positives:** The LLM finds both the Tri-Color-Risk-Check conditional skip and the TriVote approval gate. It describes the logic behind each and identifies the correct step numbers.
- **Negatives:**
  - The LLM incorrectly lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check's determination of Low/Medium/High as a decision point. According to the ground truth, the only true decision points are: (1) the branch/skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check (i.e., conditional route to manual underwriting), and (2) the TriVote gate (at least two of three must Approve). The mere rating assignment is not itself a process branch or gate.
  - The LLM also repeats and merges information in a somewhat redundant tone, rather than listing each point succinctly in one precise sentence.

### b) Required Documents

- **Positives:** The LLM identifies most core documents and lists them in roughly correct order. No hallucinated documents are present (e.g., no KYC/AML).
- **Negatives:**
  - **Misses Signed Offer Sheet 77**: The ground truth shows both "Offer Sheet 77" (step 7) and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (step 8) as distinct, but the LLM lists only "Offer Sheet 77" and then "ID Matrix Declaration."
  - **Misses the three Scorecards as separate documents:** The LLM at first mentions "Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow" as inputs, but then leaves them off the final stepwise document list, despite the process describing them as required documents, each appearing before the Deck Memo.
  - The final document list is incomplete (OMITS: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow, Signed Offer Sheet 77) and out of order in places.
- **The prompt demands all documents in order as they first appear:** The LLM fails to do this with sufficient precision.

### Other Evaluation Criteria

- **Small errors lead to significant point loss as per instructions:** Failure to distinguish the signed offer sheet, omission and misplacement of scorecards, and incorrectly labeling the scoring step as a decision point are all non-trivial.

**Overall:** The answer demonstrates general understanding, but fails strict criteria for list completeness, precise labeling of decision points, and document sequence/order. Thus, it deserves a strict 4.5.
