### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points**: The LLM incorrectly identifies three decision points, including the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a "decision point" (which is merely an assessment step producing an input for the actual conditional branch, per the ground truth). This adds an extraneous element not present in the ground truth, which strictly lists only two: the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate. The descriptions for the skip and TriVote are mostly accurate but not perfectly concise or phrased (e.g., LLM's TriVote wording introduces slight ambiguity by saying "requires approvals from all three" before clarifying the two-out-of-three rule, while ground truth is precise). The extra point and structural overcomplication (multiple subsections) warrant a significant deduction. Partial credit for covering the core two correctly. Score: ~5.0/10.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents**: Major omissions and errors. The LLM excludes the three Scorecards entirely from the final list (treating them as mere "inputs" rather than required documents explicitly named in the process description) and fails to distinguish "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate item (listing only the unsigned version). This results in only 5 items instead of 9, missing ~44% of the ground truth list in order of first appearance. The scorecards appear explicitly as inputs/documents in step 3, and the signing creates a distinct document in step 8â€”both are non-negotiable per the process. No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML items), but incompleteness is a critical flaw under strict evaluation. Score: ~3.0/10.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: The response is verbose and disorganized (redundant sections like "Step 1," "2," etc., and a "final answer" that still omits key elements), diverging from the ground truth's concise format. No adherence to "one sentence each" for rules in a clean list. Combined, these reduce coherence and accuracy, justifying the low total. Small errors (e.g., phrasing) compound with large ones (omissions, extras) for strict scoring.
