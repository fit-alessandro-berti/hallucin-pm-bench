The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth in content (correctly identifies all added tasks, the removed task, and both gateway changes with accurate IDs, names, and type transitions). However, strict evaluation penalizes minor formatting differences: inclusion of backticks around all IDs (present in 5 lines, absent in ground truth) and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway line (e.g., extra spaces after the colon in ground truth for visual alignment). These small deviations from the exact ground truth output result in a deduction of 1.0 point.
