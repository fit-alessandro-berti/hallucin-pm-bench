The LLM answer nearly matches the ground truth answer. All content is correct and complete: it identifies the same added and removed tasks, as well as the gateway type changes.

However, a small but notable deviation exists in the formatting. The LLM version quotes the ids and names for tasks (e.g., `Task_FraudCheck` (Automated Fraud Check)) instead of the unquoted style in the ground truth (Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)). Similarly, for gateways, the LLM quotes the ids and omits the extra alignment spaces present in the ground truth.

While these differences are minor and do not affect the correctness or completeness, the prompt requests "utmost strictness" and even "small errors should reflect in significant loss of points." Therefore, the deviation in output format (quotes around ids and slight differences in spacing) warrants a penalty, but not a severe one, as the substantive content is otherwise flawless.
