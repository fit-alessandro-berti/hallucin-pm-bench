8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1**: Perfect match to ground truth (exact count of 1, supported by data reference to CaseID 1002). No errors.
- **Part 2**: Strong overall (under 120 words; identifies small sample of 3 cases, rarity implication, conflation risk, and sampling bias). However, deducts for missing key ground truth elements like statistical volatility (e.g., frequency swings from 0% to 7% per event, wide confidence intervals, extreme sampling error for rare events), time span (<2 hours), and explicit near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) with strict/fuzzy matching issues. Minor speculation in hypothetical variant (“Manual Fraud Review”) not in data, though brief. More differences than minor—loses 1.5 points for incomplete depth on estimation pitfalls.
