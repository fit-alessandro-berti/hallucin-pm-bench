7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Perfect match—both identify exactly 1 occurrence. No deductions. (10/10)
- **Question 2**: The LLM answer correctly notes the limited scope (3 cases, 1 day) and risks of non-representative sampling, staying under 120 words (~105). However, it introduces speculation (e.g., "full log likely contains thousands," "if biased... may overrepresent"), violating the "no speculation" rule. It misses key ground truth elements: quantitative sampling error (e.g., frequency swinging from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals), rarity-induced variance in tiny samples (14 events, <2 hours), and distortion from near-synonyms (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check”) via strict/fuzzy matching. These omissions reduce depth and precision, leading to significant point loss under strict criteria. (5/10)

Overall, strong on basics but flawed by speculation and incomplete analysis of statistical pitfalls.
