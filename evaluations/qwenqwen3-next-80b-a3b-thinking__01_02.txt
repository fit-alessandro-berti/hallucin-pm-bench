### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortfall, ~50% weight)**: The LLM correctly identifies the three key decision points by name (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)), adhering to the prompt's requirement for exact terminology. However, it fails to "summarise" them—providing no details on conditions, outcomes, or flows (e.g., score differences ≤2 vs. escalation; amount thresholds and auto-approval vs. board referral; board's approve/reject vote). The ground truth includes concise, structured explanations, making this a significant omission. Strict deduction for incomplete summarization.

- **Required Documents (Strong Match, ~50% weight)**: The list is complete, accurate, and uses exact phrasing from the prompt (e.g., "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)", "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)", "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template"). Minor ground truth variations (e.g., abbreviated phrasing, missing "old" in address proof) do not penalize the LLM, but it omits the ground truth's emphatic note on excluded standard documents, which reinforces the non-standard process— a small but notable gap under strict criteria.

Overall, the LLM provides a solid but superficial response, missing depth in the core "summarise" directive, warranting a mid-range score with deductions for incompleteness.
