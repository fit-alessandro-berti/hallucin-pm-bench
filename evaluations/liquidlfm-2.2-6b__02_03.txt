### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Completely incorrect (claims 4 cases instead of 3; lists only 3 but miscounts total). Full deduction.
- **Question 2**: Completely incorrect (identifies "Create_Order" with wrong timestamp instead of "Pack_Items"; ignores chronological order for C456). Full deduction.
- **Question 3**: Partially correct (identifies "Cancel_Order" as appearing once), but reasoning is erroneous (wrong counts for other activities like Pack_Items/Validate_Order; misattributes to C456 instead of C789; includes irrelevant rambling). Minimal partial credit.
- **Overall**: Response violates "concise, bullet-point answers only" with long, confused exposition full of factual errors and misinterpretations. Strict scoring reflects multiple significant deviations from ground truth.
