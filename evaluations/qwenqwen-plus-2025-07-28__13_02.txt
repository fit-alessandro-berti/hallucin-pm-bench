The LLM answer is highly accurate on questions 1 and 2 (exact match to ground truth calculations, including case identification and rounding). For question 3, it meets the core criteria (single occurrence noted, instability via skewing/overfitting, caution on generalization) within the word limit and stays data-bound. Minor deduction for not explicitly addressing statistical specifics like cycle times or confidence intervals (as in the sample), slightly reducing depth despite overall relevance.
