**9.0**

- The LLM answer is almost fully correct:
  - Q1: Correct ("1 time").
  - Q2a and Q2b: Both answers (2.08% and 8.33%) are accurate and well-calculated.
  - Q3: The explanation hits all requirements: single occurrence, risk of skewing stats/predictions, risk for generalizationâ€”but lacks explicit mention of variance/statistical instability ("confidence intervals", "variance", or "instability" are not named; it merely hints at "skew" and "overfitting"). This is a minor miss, but worth deducting a point for, given your strictness.
- No invented info; all adheres to supplied data.
- Structure, clarity, and numbers rounding are all correct.

**Small error for not stating "variance/instability/confidence" explicitly in Q3.** All else perfect.
