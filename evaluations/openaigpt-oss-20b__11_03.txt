8.0

The LLM's answer is overall accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, but several small but significant differences justify a loss of points:

Strengths:
- Correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities—Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment—based *jointly* on SLA breaches and high waiting time, and does not mention activities outside the table.
- Accurately quantifies each activity’s SLA overrun and waiting time using the values provided.
- Uses bullet points only for recommendations, as instructed.
- Refrains from introducing extraneous metrics or referencing activities not present in the table.

Errors causing points deductions:
- The recommendations, while plausible and reasonable, are not clearly “grounded in the supplied data” as strictly as the ground-truth answer (e.g., "Deploy automated document-verification workflows" is not evident from the table; the ground truth proposes rule-based pre-checks, which is a concrete, minimal intervention strictly based on the queue). Similarly, "interim risk‑triage step" and "predictive scoring engine" are extrapolations not warranted strictly by the supplied data.
- The recommendations include numerical targets for reduction (e.g., “cut waiting time by at least 30 %”) and process methods (e.g., “predictive scoring engine”) not present in the data and thus are inventive, violating the instruction to ground every sentence in the supplied data.
- The memo format omits some contextual detail from the ground truth (e.g., total sample size; period covered).
- The LLM answer invents a date (5 Aug 2025), not supplied in the data.

These cumulative, albeit small, errors and departures from the required strict data-grounding and instruction warrant a reduction to 8.0.
