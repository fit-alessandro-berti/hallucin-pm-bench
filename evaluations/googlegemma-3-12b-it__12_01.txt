The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a concise justification with relevant case IDs (1001 and 1003) and activities, accurately noting the reversed or absent ordering in those cases. However, it deductibly loses points for significant omissions: (1) failure to address Case 1002 at all, where "Update_Inventory" is absent, directly disproving the "always" claim (a critical gap under strict evidence-based evaluation); (2) indirect phrasing for Case 1001 that implies but does not explicitly state the reversal ("Update_Inventory" before "Authorize_Refund"); and (3) lack of line citations or explicit coverage of all cases as in the ground truth, reducing completeness despite brevity matching the prompt.
