**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Criteria)
The LLM answer has **critical structural failures** making it an invalid/incomplete BPMN model, plus multiple violations of prompt constraints. Compared line-by-line to ground truth:

#### Fatal Errors (-4.0 points each, total -8.0):
- **Missing flow from "Provide Reset Instructions"**: No outgoing `sequenceFlow` (dead-end for Password Reset path, violating lines 3/7). Ground truth has `f5: t2 → t6`.
- **Invalid decision after "Confirm with Customer"**: No `gw3`; direct dual `sequenceFlow` from task (`sf10` unconditional to end, `sf11` conditional loop) models unstructured/parallel split, not exclusive gateway. Violates BPMN semantics and line 9 loop. Ground truth uses `gw3` with `f12/f13`.
- **Incomplete process flow**: Password Reset cannot reach resolution/confirm/end.

#### Major Constraint Violations (-1.0 each, total -4.0):
- **Extra diagram namespaces** (`bpmndi`, `dc`, `di`, `xsi` unnecessary): Prompt forbids diagram elements. Ground truth clean.
- **Exceeds ≤40 lines**: LLM ~55 indented lines vs. ground ~35 compact.
- **Non-concise IDs**: `classifyTicket`, `provideResetInstructions` etc. vs. prompt example `t1`, `gw1` and ground `t1/t2...`.
- **Invented conditions**: Specific `ticket.category == "Password Reset"`, `diagnosis.issue == "Resolved"` vs. ground/prompt-neutral `yes`/`no`.
- **Wrong `isExecutable="true"`**: Ground `false`.

#### Minor Errors (-0.2 each, total -1.0; strict deduction):
- No `<?xml>` header.
- Missing names: Events/gateways unnamed (ground has descriptive e.g. `name="Password Reset?"`).
- Process ID mismatch: `supportTicketProcess` vs. `support_ticket`.
- Task name slight variance: "Automatic Classification" vs. ground "Auto-Classification" (prompt-implied exact).

**Base 10.0 → Deducted to 2.0**. Partial credit for ~70% elements (start/classify/gw1/gw2/diagnosis/forward/resolve/confirm/loop intent), but core flow broken + violations = near-failure. Matches "hallucination trap" (fabricated flows/conditions, missing loop gateway).
