9.0

1. The count ("1") is fully correct—no error.
2. The percentage "1/18 = 5.56 %" gives the correct value, but the format is less precise than ground truth which writes "5.56 %" and includes a calculation formula. The presentation is minimally less clear, a very small error.
3. The answer "A1002" is correct, but does not state "Only case" as in the ground truth. This is a very minor omission in phrasing but does not affect the information conveyed.
4. Both sampling-related reasons provided are factually correct and directly derived:  
   - "(1) The fragment covers only a single day; weekly or monthly fluctuation can’t be captured." aligns with "temporal bias" in the ground truth.  
   - "(2) Only four orders are included, giving far too small a sample..." addresses "small sample size."  
However, minor additional context in the ideal answer (like mentioning truncation/case-mix) is not required as only two reasons are requested.

Overall, all facts are correct, and the information is strictly grounded in the visible log. Some very minor formatting, phrasing, or clarity omissions slightly distinguish this from a perfect score.

**Strictly applying the evaluation criteria, I deduct 0.5-1.0 points for minor wording/formatting deviations, resulting in a 9.0.**
