9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Matches exactly in content (count is "1"), but lacks the explicit "occurrence" phrasing from ground truth. Minor wording omission deducts slightly under strict criteria (-0.5 points).
- **Question 2**: Perfect match in calculation, result, and formatting (5.56%). Includes the division inline, aligning closely with the ground truth's explicit formula. Full points.
- **Question 3**: Correct identifier (A1002), but omits the fuller explanatory phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”"). This makes it concise to a fault, missing the ground truth's clarity on exclusivity (-1.0 point).
- **Question 4**: Correctly identifies and states two valid reasons (temporal bias/single-day coverage; small sample size/four orders), which align with ground truth options. Explanations are clear and relevant but less detailed/precise (e.g., no mention of variance impact like ±5.56 pp. or high-risk segments). Under strictness, this brevity reduces depth (-0.5 points).

Overall, the answer is highly accurate with no hallucinations or deviations from the log data, but minor phrasing and detail gaps prevent a perfect score. Strong adherence to the prompt's constraints.
