The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint criteria of SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth. It accurately quantifies SLA excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) with correct calculations grounded in the table data. However, it deviates significantly in structure and detail: lacks a "From" line, subject header, and reference to total cases (e.g., ground truth's "4 805 completed cases"); does not explicitly quantify waiting times in the activity descriptions despite the joint evaluation criterion (ground truth includes 600s, 480s, 200s); and provides vague, non-data-driven recommendations (e.g., "assigning additional resources" vs. ground truth's specific "rule-based pre-checks" or "add one risk analyst"). The memo is shorter (~120 words vs. â‰ˆ150), omits bold formatting for emphasis, and includes unsubstantiated closing projections absent in data, reducing concreteness and fidelity. Bullet points are used correctly for recommendations only, but their generic nature violates the "concrete, data-driven" requirement, warranting a substantial deduction under strict evaluation.
