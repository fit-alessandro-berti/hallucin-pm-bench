8.0

The LLM answer is overall accurate and adheres closely to the ground truth, correctly listing the decision points and required documents, and generally respecting the terminology and flow as required. However, there are some notable minor issues:

Issues:
- The LLM answer inserts sub-bullets under the "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" decision point, stating "Board votes approve/reject" as explicit "decisions." While technically correct, this adds a level of detail (action outcomes) that the ground truth omits.
- The "Amount Threshold Decision" section in the LLM answer refers to proceeding to "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" but could have emphasized that this only applies for amounts ≥ €15 000, matching the explicit equivalence in the ground truth (though it is clear enough).
- The required documents listing is completely accurate, but "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" slightly adds to the provided terminology, whereas ground truth uses just "Community Impact Statement (CIS)." This is a negligible deviation.

Strengths:
- The answer uses the required exact activity names.
- The documents listed match the ground truth, with no extraneous or omitted items.
- The decision points are all present, in the correct order, and with the required process logic and thresholds.
- No standard loan terminology is introduced.

Small errors (extra detail in bullet points and minor wording differences) mean a deduction is warranted; however, the answer is functionally correct and does not omit any required decision points or documents. Thus, the answer deserves an 8.0—not perfectly concise or strictly aligned, but very solid.
