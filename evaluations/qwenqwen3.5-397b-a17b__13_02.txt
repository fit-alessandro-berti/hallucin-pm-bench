**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth with no substantive differences. Numerics are exact (1; 2.08%; 8.33%). Explanation (92 words ≤100) explicitly covers: (i) single occurrence ("only one occurrence across 12 cases"), (ii) variance/instability (skews aggregate metrics like cycle time; overfits/ignores as noise), (iii) over-generalisation caution (assumes representative; inaccurate planning/assessment; does not reflect typical reality). Minor formatting (e.g., "%" spacing, "out of" vs. formula) is negligible under strict evaluation, as content is deterministic and criteria fully met.
