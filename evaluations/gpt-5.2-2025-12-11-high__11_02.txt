**8.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer strongly aligns with the prompt: correctly identifies the **exact same three worst-performing activities** as the ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), provides explanations **strictly tied to table metrics** (throughput drops, wait times, processing times, stdev, rework, SLA breaches), and delivers **one concrete, data-driven action per activity** with specific, measurable targets (e.g., "rework 22% → <10%", "stdev 9 → <5"). Structure is executive-memo-like (To: COO, numbered list), concise (~140 words <200), and avoids absent activities or guesses. No hallucinations.

**Key Strengths (Supporting High Base Score):**
- Perfect activity selection (clearly differentiated by data: Request's 150min wait/22% rework; Review's 25min proc/9 stdev/12.4% SLA; Initial's 18min wait/3.2% SLA).
- Data citations accurate except one issue.
- Actions are concrete/data-driven, matching GT's intent (e.g., validation/triage/capacity tweaks).

**Penalties (Strict Deductions for Differences/Errors, -1.8 total):**
- **Factual inaccuracy (-1.0, significant):** Calls Request_Documents "**lowest throughput (190/day)**" – **false**; table shows 179-185 for downstream (Pay_Claim/Notify_Claim lowest). GT correctly says "drops to 190" without misstating absolute. Small data misread = major strict penalty.
- **Content/Explanation diffs (-0.4):** Omits Review_Documents' 30min wait (GT highlights as "preceded by 30 min queue"); less emphasis on upstream "feeding congestion" for Initial_Assessment. No intro/conclusion projecting benefits (GT adds ~10% throughput lift, 40% SLA reduction).
- **Style/structure diffs (-0.2):** More list-like vs. GT's narrative polish; different (valid) recommendations (e.g., LLM's "first-time-right checklist" vs. GT's "digital validation"; no AI/squads). Minor phrasing (e.g., "bottleneck" vs. "hotspots").
- **No other errors:** Metrics otherwise precise, no overreach.

Overall: Excellent fulfillment (90%+ match), but strict rubric demands perfection on data facts/phrasing – docks to 8.2.
