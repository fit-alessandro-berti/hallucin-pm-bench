7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies **all** required changes: exactly 3 added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), 1 removed (Task_RejectLoan), and 1 gateway change (exclusive to inclusive). No extras/missing items. Proper grouping under exact 3 headings. No mention of ignored elements (e.g., renamings like "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name change).
- **Major deductions (-2.8 total)**:
  - **Extra interpretive/verbose text**: Every bullet has unnecessary descriptions (e.g., "after the start event", "branching from the gateway (previously only...)", "(now supports multiple parallel paths instead of a single choice)"). Violates "summarise *strictly*" and concise ground truth style. (-1.2)
  - **Mischaracterization of changes**: Describes Task_FinalReject as "replacing... (renamed and functionally distinct)" and Task_RejectLoan as "replaced by" – implies modification/renaming, contradicting XML diff (new ID = added; old ID = removed). Ignores "cosmetic renamings" instruction by speculating. (-1.0)
  - **Format/presentation mismatch**: Lists IDs first (backticks) vs. ground truth's **name first** (`ID` in parens). Extra separators (---), bolding, numbering style differs. No v1/v2 versioning or XOR/OR notation. No closing note on "no other changes." (-0.6)
- **Why not lower?** Core facts 100% accurate; no factual errors or omissions.
- **Why not higher?** Strictness demands near-exact match to ground truth's concise, neutral format/listing – extras and implications are "small errors" warranting significant loss.
