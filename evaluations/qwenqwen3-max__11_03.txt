7.5

The LLM answer is factually accurate regarding the identification of the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) and quantifies both the throughput times and SLA breaches correctly, closely matching the ground truth. Waiting times cited are correct, and the structure follows the prompt requirements (e.g., recommendations in bullet points).

However, there are notable shortcomings:

- The memo omits the proper header (sender and date/context), which the ground truth includes.
- The LLM answer lacks the total case count and the positive assertion about process scope found in the ground truth.
- The recommendations are generic and not as concretely tied to the table or process as the ground truth. For instance, "Reallocate underutilized staff" and "Automate data-pull steps" are plausible but not as specific as "Add one risk analyst to the peak morning window" or "Deploy a 'straight-through' heuristic for loans under €25k." The LLM also invents possible reallocation from named activities, which is not grounded in table data (a minor infraction).
- The statement “All three show waiting times constituting most of their throughput” is a mild inference, as the concept "most of their throughput" is not requested and not strictly derived from the table.  
- The ground truth gives a projected quantitative impact of the changes; the LLM answer does not.

These differences, especially in recommendation specificity and contextual rigor, warrant a significant deduction, though the answer is structurally mostly correct and accurate.
