The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" as the response, accurately cites the key counterexamples from cases C003 (lines 6-7) and C005 (line 11) to disprove the "always" claim, and provides a logical justification in one paragraph with precise line and case references, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements. It introduces minor extraneous details about cases C001, C002, and C004 where the activity does follow (which are factually correct but not essential for refutation, slightly deviating from the ground truth's concise focus on counterexamples only), resulting in a small deduction for not matching the exact brevity and structure; no factual errors or omissions weaken the core argument.
