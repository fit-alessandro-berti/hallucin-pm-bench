The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth answer, both in content and justification. It correctly says "No," appropriately references the relevant cases (C003 and C005), and cites the specific lines involved. The discussion of positive cases (C001, C002, C004) is not required and adds marginally unnecessary detail, but it does not introduce any misinformation. The answer remains faithful, precise, and clearly sourced to the log fragment. The only point deducted (0.5) is for this slightly extraneous commentary, which in an extremely strict evaluation is extra to the core negative evidence requested by the task. Otherwise, this is a strong answer.
