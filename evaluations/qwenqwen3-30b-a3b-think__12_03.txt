The LLM answer gives the correct final verdict (“No”) and clearly cites the two relevant violating cases (C002, C004), accurately describing the sequences that break the “always immediately after” rule. It also correctly explains the nature of the violation (an intervening activity in each sequence).

However, compared to the ground truth, the answer does not:
- Systematically mention every case, including the ones that *do* fit the claimed rule (C001, C003); therefore, it lacks full exhaustiveness.
- Quantify or summarize the total number of violations and non-violations (it mentions violations only).
- Explicitly reinforce that some cases adhere while others do not, which helps highlight why the statement is inaccurate.
- Use a tabular format, which, though not strictly required, improves clarity and thoroughness as seen in the ground truth.
- Spell out that “two out of four cases violate the rule,” as the ground truth does.

Due to these omissions—mainly of completeness and explicit contrast—the answer loses 1.5 points for missing minor but important details that support highest-quality, evidential, and exhaustive justification. Otherwise, the essential logic and citations are solid.
