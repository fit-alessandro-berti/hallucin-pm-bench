The LLM answer is correct in its core determination ("No") and provides accurate, relevant justifications by citing the two violating cases (C002 and C004) with precise sequences and timestamps that directly disprove the "always" claim. This suffices for the task, as counterexamples alone invalidate the FACT without needing exhaustive coverage of compliant cases. However, under utmost strictness, the response loses a minor 0.5 point for lacking the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case enumeration (e.g., explicitly noting C001 and C003 as compliant for fuller context), which adds thoroughness without altering the conclusion. No factual errors or omissions in sequences/timestamps.
