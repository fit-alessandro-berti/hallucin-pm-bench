10.0

The LLM answer produces a semantically equivalent BPMN 2.0 XML that fully models the required process flow without hallucinations or omissions of explicitly mentioned elements. It includes all specified gateways, exactly two end events, proper id prefixing, and verbatim task names from the prompt (e.g., "validates the claim", "checks warranty eligibility", "send rejection notice", "Create shipment order"). The structure correctly handles the validation loop, warranty check as a distinct task (required by step 3 but omitted in ground truth), and parallel activities with split/join. Minor differences from the ground truth (e.g., more verbose XML with incoming/outgoing references, flow names, process attributes, optional diagram section, and exact-tense task names matching the prompt over the ground truth's imperative adjustments) are allowable variations in representation and do not alter semantics. The ground truth itself deviates by omitting the "checks warranty eligibility" task, using non-verbatim names, and adding unsubstantiated phrasing (e.g., start event "submitted"). Under strict evaluation prioritizing semantic fidelity to the prompt over superficial mismatches, this receives full credit.
