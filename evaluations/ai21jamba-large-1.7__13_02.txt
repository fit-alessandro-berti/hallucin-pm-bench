The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely on questions 1 and 2 (exact counts and percentages, with appropriate rounding and calculations). For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, explicitly notes the single occurrence, highlights risks of instability/variance (e.g., over-representing edge cases, skewing metrics, distorting models), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., misleading when extrapolating to broader data), fulfilling all required elements without invention or deviation from the log.
