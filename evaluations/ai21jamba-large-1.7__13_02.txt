**9.0**

1. **Correctness of answer for Q1:**  
   - "Manual_Fraud_Check" does occur exactly **1** time.  
   - **Full points.**

2. **Correctness for Q2:**  
   a) Calculates **2.08%** for events (1/48 × 100 = 2.08%).  
   b) Calculates **8.33%** for unique cases (1/12 × 100 = 8.33%).  
   - **Full points**, correct rounding.

3. **Explanation in Q3:**  
   - The answer correctly highlights the rarity, the risk of over-representing edge cases, and mentions that it could distort models or misclassify patterns, reducing accuracy. It mentions "overemphasize rare... deviations" and "outliers could distort...," which signals caution about generalising.  
   - **However**, it does not explicitly and directly mention:  
     (i) that all derived statistics rest on a *single* observation,  
     (ii) the *variance/instability* or *noise/vulnerability*,  
     (iii) *confidence intervals* or numerical instability.  
   - The answer gets close, but it lacks the clear, explicit statements about statistical unreliability (variance, wide confidence intervals, noise, overfitting, etc.) present in the ground truth.

**Deduction:**  
- Q1/Q2: 0 points off.  
- Q3: Minor but important omission of the technical/statistical caveats about single-case variance and instability, which should be clearly stated as per prompt.

**Final:**  
**9.0** (Very good, but minor shortcoming in Q3’s statistical warning).
