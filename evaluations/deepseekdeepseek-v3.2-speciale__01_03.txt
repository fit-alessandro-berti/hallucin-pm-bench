**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) (Decision points)**: Near-perfect match. Both correctly identify the exact two decision points with accurate one-sentence rules faithful to the process. Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for: (1) step-number references and parenthetical labels ("Step 4 (conditional branch)") instead of GT's abstract descriptive titles (e.g., "**Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check**"); (2) addition of unstated "otherwise the loan is rejected" (GT/process imply failure to pass/advance but do not specify "rejected," risking minor extrapolation).
- **Part b) (Documents)**: Exact match in content, order, completeness, and numbering (9 items, no hallucinations/missing/extra). No deductions.
- **Overall**: Substantively identical (no factual errors, hallucinations, omissions, or extras); differences are stylistic/phrasing only. Strict grading applied, but high fidelity warrants strong score.
