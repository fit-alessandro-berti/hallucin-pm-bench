The LLM answer accurately identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets from Process B in the correct order, with no factual errors or extraneous information about other processes. It fully complies with the prompt's requirements. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., bullet points vs. inline notation with â€–, added parenthetical descriptions like "(After Parallel Split #1)", introductory phrasing, and absence of the ground truth's explicit closing statement), which slightly deviate from the ground truth's more compact and symbolic formatting. Under utmost strictness, these formatting variances warrant a small but noticeable point reduction from a perfect score.
