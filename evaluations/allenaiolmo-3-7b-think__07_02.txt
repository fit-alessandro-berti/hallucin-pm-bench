**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks**: Partial credit (2.5/10). Correctly identifies "Verify Identity", "Request Additional Documents", "Final Reject". **Major error**: Incorrectly adds "Auto-Approve Loan" (same ID `Task_ApproveLoan` as V1's "Approve Loan"; rename ignored per instructions). No IDs or numbering as in GT. Extra item deviates significantly.
- **Removed tasks**: Partial credit (2.0/10). Correctly identifies "Reject Loan". **Major error**: Incorrectly removes "Approve Loan" (persists with renamed `Task_ApproveLoan`). GT has only one; LLM doubles it wrongly.
- **Gateway-type changes**: Good but incomplete (7.0/10). Notes exclusive → inclusive correctly, but lacks GT's precision (ID `Gateway_Decision`, XOR/OR notation). No explicit "no other changes".
- **Overall**: Factual errors in 2/3 sections misrepresent changes (rename confusion violates "ignore cosmetic renamings"). No GT structure (bold, numbering, IDs, note). Strict penalty for differences: ~40% accuracy → 3.0 total.
