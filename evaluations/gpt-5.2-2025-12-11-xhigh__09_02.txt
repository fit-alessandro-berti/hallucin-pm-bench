The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps and presence of only counts as the reason the average cycle time cannot be computed, and it is concise (one sentence). Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences ("cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "start–complete time differences ... event occurrence counts" vs. "duration information ... event counts ... start-to-completion intervals") and not using "impossible," which is a small stylistic deviation under utmost strictness.
