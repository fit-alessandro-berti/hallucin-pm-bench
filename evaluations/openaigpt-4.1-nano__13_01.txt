9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match in content (1 occurrence/time). Minor phrasing difference ("time" vs. "occurrence") is negligible. Full points.
- **Question 2**: Exact match in calculation, result (5.56%), and explanation of total events. Full points.
- **Question 3**: Exact match in identifying A1002 as the only case. Minor phrasing ("the case identifier" vs. "only case") is negligible. Full points.
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid, clear reasons directly aligned with ground truth options: (1) "Small sample size" matches exactly (references 18 log lines and representation issues); (2) "Limited scope and timeframe" closely paraphrases "Temporal bias" (single day, lack of monthly variability). No hallucinations or unsupported inferences. Slight deduction (0.5 points) for less precise detail compared to ground truth examples (e.g., no mention of variance percentage or exact time window like "morning of 1 May 2025"), per strictness on small differences.

The response adheres to the prompt's constraints (no inferences beyond the log), is concise, and derives everything from the provided data. Overall, near-perfect alignment with ground truth.
