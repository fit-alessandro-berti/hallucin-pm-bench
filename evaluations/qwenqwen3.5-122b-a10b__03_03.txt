**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth and superior in several key ways, warranting full credit under the provided rubric despite superficial differences like IDs, whitespace, flow names, capitalization, and the presence of diagram interchange (DI) information. 

- **No omissions**: Includes all explicit flow elements from the process description (8 tasks verbatim: "validates the claim", "requests missing information", "checks warranty eligibility", "send rejection notice", "Create shipment order", "Schedule courier pickup", "update inventory records", "close the claim"). The ground truth omits the explicitly mentioned "checks warranty eligibility" task (step 3), modeling the warranty gateway directly after validation instead of after the check task—making the LLM more faithful to "model **only** the flow elements explicitly mentioned" without omission.
- **No extras/hallucinations**: Exactly the specified gateways (2 exclusive, parallel split/join pair), exactly 2 end events, no invented paths, escalations, or error handling. 16 sequence flows support the extra task correctly (ground has 15).
- **Verbatim task names**: Matches bolded text precisely (e.g., "validates the claim" vs ground's "Validate the claim"; "requests missing information" vs ground's "Request missing information"). Start event name verbatim "online warranty claim".
- **Required structure**: wrc_ ID prefix on all elements ✓; correct loop for incomplete claims (validate → completeness GW → request → validate); warranty branch ✓; parallel for step 4 ✓.
- **Diagram completeness**: Includes full <bpmndi:BPMNDiagram> with shapes/edges, fulfilling "BPMN 2.0 XML **diagram**" (ground truth lacks DI, making it model-only, not a renderable diagram).
- **Minor allowed diffs**: Different IDs/namespaces/targetNS/verbose flow labels (e.g., "Within warranty"/"Out of warranty" match text) explicitly permitted as "semantically equivalent". No deductions warranted.

Strict evaluation confirms no violations; differences enhance completeness/accuracy without extras in flow elements.
