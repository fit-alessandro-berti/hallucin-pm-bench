**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth. 

- Q1: Identical ("**1**").
- Q2a/b: Identical calculations, rounding (2.08%, 8.33%), and percentages (minor formatting like space before % is insignificant).
- Q3: ≤100 words (70); fully satisfies criteria—(i) single occurrence/scant evidence, (ii) variance/instability (skew durations, overfit noise), (iii) over-generalisation (harming generalisability). Substance equivalent to sample; no inventions, strictly from data.
