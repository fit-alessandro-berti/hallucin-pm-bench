9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B, in perfect alphabetical order both within pairs and overall (Create_Documentation—Quality_Check before Procure_Materials—Schedule_Machines). No extraneous pairs or references to Process A. The format for pairs matches the required `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (two spaces before/after —), one per line.

Minor deductions for:
- Unnecessary "**Process B parallel pairs:**" title (not in ground truth).
- Inline backticks around pairs (ground truth uses code block without).
- Lack of column alignment in second pair (ground truth pads "Procure_Materials     —" to align —).
- Reasoning section uses table format instead of bulleted *Rationale*, with slightly different wording ("synchronisation point" vs. "overlap windows"; step table vs. direct quotes).

Substance and correctness are flawless (no functional errors), but strict format/presentation deviations warrant deduction from 10.0.
