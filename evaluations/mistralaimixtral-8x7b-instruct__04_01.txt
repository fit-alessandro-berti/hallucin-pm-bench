**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it declares "Compliant" despite clear violations of Rules 2 and 3 (as per ground truth), reversing the order in Rule 2 (`Risk_Assessment` at 9 is *after* `Ship_Goods` at 8, not before) and miscalculating Rule 3 distance (event 10 is 4 positions after 6, exceeding ≤2; ground truth notes distance=3 violation). It provides false justifications for these rules while correctly assessing Rules 1, 4, and 5. Overall verdict mismatch and two major rule errors warrant minimum score under strict criteria.
