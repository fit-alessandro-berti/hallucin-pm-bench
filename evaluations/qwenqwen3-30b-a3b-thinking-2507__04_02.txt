5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification accurate and concise (matches ground truth intent). No deduction.
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated). Justification fundamentally flawed—fails to account for R5's required new approval on 2025-03-07 as the "last required approval," leading to miscalculation of the 2-day window for Ship_Goods. Major error in rule interaction; significant deduction.
- **R3**: Status correct (Violated). Justification matches ground truth closely. Minimal deduction for minor phrasing differences.
- **R4**: Status correct (Not Applicable). Justification equivalent. No deduction.
- **R5**: Status correct (Violated). Justification captures the core violation (events before new approval) but slightly less precise than ground truth. Minor deduction.
- **R6**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification identical. No deduction.
- **Overall Result**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). However, misses specifying R2 as a violation, understating the scope of issues compared to ground truth. Further deduction for incomplete analysis.
- **Format and Conciseness**: Follows prompt (status + ≤20-word justification per rule; all-caps conclusion). No issues.
- **Strictness Applied**: The R2 error demonstrates a critical misunderstanding of interdependent rules (R2 and R5), resulting in a substantial point loss (equivalent to ~30-40% of evaluation weight). Minor variances in wording across rules compound to prevent a higher score. Total reflects ~2/6 rules with notable issues, heavily weighted by severity.
