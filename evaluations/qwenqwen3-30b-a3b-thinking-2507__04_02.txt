5.5

Rationale for scoring:

- **R1:** Correct. The answer matches the ground truth.
- **R2:** Incorrect. The LLM marked this as "Compliant" due to considering the last required approval before the Change_Request (which ended on 2025-03-04 08:17); however, a Change_Request after approval requires a new Manager_Approval, making the Ship_Goods deadline relative to the new approval (2025-03-07 15:10). The LLM answer missed this cascade effect. This is a significant logic error.
- **R3:** Correct. Both match, and the justification is correct.
- **R4:** Correct. Both match, and the justification is correct.
- **R5:** Correct. Both match, and the justification is correct.
- **R6:** Correct. Both match, and the justification is correct.
- **Overall:** Correct. NON-COMPLIANT — the overall status is correct, but the rule breakdown is not entirely accurate due to R2.

**Noticeable differences:**  
1. The LLM answer for R2 is wrong; it's a directly critical rule for this type of compliance checking.  
2. All other rules are evaluated correctly.  
3. Explanations are sufficiently concise.

**Deduction:**  
- R2 is a fundamental violation that the answer missed (at least -3 points for critical logic error).
- 0.5 point penalty for missing the subtle cascade caused by Change_Request relative to the approvals in R2 justification.
- No major justification mistakes elsewhere.

**Final:** 5.5/10.0 — Missing the correct application of R2 is a major logic issue for an auditing scenario. Strict grading penalizes this proportionally.
