9.0

The LLM’s answer includes both correct pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel in Process B, and outputs them in the correct pairing format, matching the task names precisely.

However, it loses 1 point for the following reason:
- The answer does not align the task pairs for visual consistency—the ground truth adds spaces for alignment:  
  `Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines`  
  The LLM answer omits the extra spaces, producing:  
  `Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`  
  This is a small formatting discrepancy.

Otherwise, the content, alphabetical order, and per-line format are all correct. The omission of alignment, while minor, constitutes a nonzero error according to your instruction for strictness—thus the LLM answer is not a perfect 10.0.
