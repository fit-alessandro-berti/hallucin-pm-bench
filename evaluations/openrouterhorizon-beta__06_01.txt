The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs identified (only the two correct parallel pairs from Process B), alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and in the list), and required format. The minor visual alignment spacing in the ground truth appears to be a display artifact (e.g., for monospace rendering) and does not constitute a substantive difference. No errors or omissions.
