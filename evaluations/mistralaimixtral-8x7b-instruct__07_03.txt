### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Missed critical functional change (major deduction)**: Failed to identify Gateway_Payment change (exclusive → parallel), despite it being explicitly verifiable in XML (v1: `exclusiveGateway`, v2: `parallelGateway`). Instruction requires "*all* functional changes". This alone warrants ~50% loss.
- **Formatting violations (significant deductions)**:
  - Headings not verbatim: Prefixed with "-" (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS") instead of plain "ADDED TASKS".
  - Incorrect list structure: Headings bulleted, sub-items indented inconsistently vs. ground truth.
  - Escaped underscores in **all** IDs (e.g., "Task\_FraudCheck" vs. "Task_FraudCheck"; "Gateway\_ReviewNeeded" vs. "Gateway_ReviewNeeded") – 5 instances, each a small but strict error.
  - Minor spacing: No space after ":" in gateway description (vs. ground truth).
- **Correct elements (partial credit)**: Added tasks (3/3 correct content), Removed tasks (1/1 correct), one gateway change correct.
- **Overall**: Incomplete (misses 1/2 gateway changes), non-verbatim output, multiple small errors compound to low score under "utmost strictness". Not executable as-is per prompt.
