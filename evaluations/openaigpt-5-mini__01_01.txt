5.0

The LLM answer identifies more decision points (5) than the ground truth (3), splitting the approvals into separate finance, senior auditor, and payment gating decisions rather than combining them into a single "final payment approval." This introduces granularity and additional interpretive elements (e.g., explicit conditions and per-decision document ties) not present in the ground truth, representing significant structural and content differences. While the high-value threshold and eligibility points align reasonably, the expansion deviates from the ground truth's concise summary. The document list matches exactly (same 7 items with appropriate notes), providing partial credit, but the overall deviations in decision point summarization warrant a mid-range score under strict evaluation criteria.
