**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **R1**: Status match (Compliant). Justifications equivalent (both note >€10k with correct sequence). No deduction.
- **R2**: Major error. Status wrong (Compliant vs. **Violated**). Justification incorrect (ignores change-triggered new Manager_Approval on 03-07 as "last required approval," missing that Ship_Goods on 03-05 precedes it, violating "within 2 days *after*"). -3.0 points.
- **R3**: Status and justification match (Violated; Pay_Invoice 03-06 before Receive_Goods 03-07). No deduction.
- **R4**: Status and justification match (Not Applicable; hazardous=false). No deduction.
- **R5**: Status match (Violated). Justifications similar (both note post-change steps before new Manager_Approval; minor scope diff: LLM cites Ship_Goods, ground truth adds Pay_Invoice—negligible). No deduction.
- **R6**: Status and justification match (Compliant; ends with Archive_Record). No deduction.
- **Overall**: Match (NON-COMPLIANT). No deduction.
- **Format**: Matches required structure (per-rule status + ≤20-word justification, all-caps conclusion). Minor (no bolding), but compliant.
- **Strictness adjustment**: Single critical rule error (inter-rule reasoning failure on R2/R5 linkage) warrants significant penalty despite 5/6 rules perfect and correct overall. Base 10 - 3.0 = 7.0.
