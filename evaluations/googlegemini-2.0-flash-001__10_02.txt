**Justification:**

- **Vocabulary Adherence**: The LLM answer successfully replaced non-mandated terms with "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst" in tasks and role columns, following the vocabulary mandate.
- **Structure/Format**: Table is clean and in markdown. However, the LLM omitted the "Operations Manager" role, which is included in the ground truth and is critical for properly reflecting accountabilities (A) as per process best practices.
- **Coverage of Tasks**: The LLM's table does not fully mirror the task breakdown in the ground truth answer:
    - Task granularity is vague: e.g., "Log Transfer Instruction" (vs. more precise "Receive Payment Instruction") and "Release Payment/Send SWIFT" (instead of distinguishing "Release Payment" and "Send SWIFT message").
    - "Archive Case File/Notification" is ambiguous and does not split "Archive Record" from notification.
- **RACI Assignments**: Significant mismatches:
    - The LLM conflates "Accountable" with "Approver" in task 4 â€“ "A" for "Regulatory Liaison" only at approval, but accountability is missing elsewhere.
    - "Operations Manager" (accountability owner in nearly every step per ground truth) is entirely absent.
    - C and I roles are underutilized or missing (e.g., no "Consulted" or "Informed" indicated for several receive/screening steps).
    - The "Release Payment/Send SWIFT" task gives responsibility to both Transaction Analyst and IT Support, which is partially overlapping and does not clearly separate these actions.
    - Transaction Analyst is marked as "Responsible" for all front/middle operations regardless of accountability, which does not reflect the RACI assignments in the ground truth.
- **Omissions and Small Errors**:
    - No legend provided.
    - Some tasks are ambiguously worded or merged, losing clarity present in ground truth.
    - "Release Payment/Send SWIFT" does not respect process separation as shown in the source (clerk releases payment, IT sends SWIFT).

**Summary:**  
The LLM mostly adheres to the vocabulary mandate, but omits a major role (Operations Manager), assigns RACI roles incorrectly/missing for several steps, combines distinct activities, and loses accuracy versus the ground truth. This warrants a **significantly low score** for strict grading, though not the minimum since terms are, on the whole, correctly substituted.
