### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Roles/Columns**: The LLM uses only three columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), correctly adhering to the source text and mandated vocabulary without inventing roles. However, the ground truth introduces an unmentioned "Operations Manager" as a fourth column, distributing responsibilities across it. This structural mismatch (missing column and redistributed assignments) alone justifies major point deduction, as the RACI matrix fails to align on participant scope.

- **Task Wording and Coverage**: 
  - LLM tasks like "Log Transfer Instruction" differ from GT's "Receive Payment Instruction" (both cover step 1 but with imprecise phrasing; informal text combines receiving/logging, yet GT splits semantically).
  - "Sanctions Screening" vs. GT's "Screen Against Sanctions List" – minor rephrasing, but strictness demands exact fidelity.
  - "KYC Review" matches mandated term exactly (positive), but "Approve High-Risk Transaction" vs. GT's plural "Approve High-Risk Transactions" introduces a subtle inconsistency.
  - "Release Payment/Send SWIFT" combines steps 5a (clerk releases) and 5b (IT sends), diverging from GT's singular "Release Payment" (omits SWIFT explicitly).
  - "Archive Case File/Notification" bundles archiving and notification, vs. GT's concise "Archive Record" – this conflation alters clarity and omits separation of notification.
  - Overall, LLM covers all source steps but rephrases 4/6 tasks differently, violating the "maps every step... without omissions or substitutions" implicit in GT's fidelity.

- **RACI Assignments**: Completely misaligned in nearly every cell, indicating failure to replicate GT's distribution:
  - Step 1: LLM (R Analyst only) vs. GT (R Analyst, I Liaison, A Operations Manager, C IT Support) – misses all secondary roles.
  - Step 2: LLM (R Analyst) vs. GT (R Analyst, A Liaison, I Operations Manager, C IT Support) – omits accountability and consultations.
  - Step 3: LLM (R Liaison) vs. GT (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Operations Manager, I IT Support) – ignores consultations and accountability.
  - Step 4: LLM (A Liaison) vs. GT (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Operations Manager, I IT Support) – shifts from R/A to A only, missing others.
  - Step 5: LLM (R Analyst, R IT Support) vs. GT (R Analyst, I Liaison, A Operations Manager, C IT Support) – incorrect dual R, misses I/A/C.
  - Step 6: LLM (I Liaison, R IT Support) vs. GT (C Analyst, I Liaison, A Operations Manager, R IT Support) – omits C and A.
  - These are not minor; they fundamentally alter responsibility flows, with ~80% of cells differing. Even if LLM better matches the informal source (e.g., direct mapping without extras), strict comparison to GT penalizes all variances heavily.

- **Formatting and Additional Elements**:
  - No legend in LLM (GT includes "Legend" with definitions) – essential for RACI clarity, a clear omission.
  - No bolding on R/A as in GT (e.g., **R**, **A** for emphasis).
  - LLM adds an introductory "OK. Here's the RACI table..." phrase, unnecessary and not in GT.
  - GT includes a post-table note on vocabulary adherence; LLM lacks this, though it implicitly follows mandates.

- **Vocabulary Adherence**: LLM correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions – a strong point, but insufficient to offset the above given strictness on holistic matching.

Small errors (e.g., task rephrasing, missing legend) compound with major ones (assignments, structure), resulting in low overall fidelity. The LLM captures the source intent better in some ways (no extraneous roles), but against GT as the benchmark, it scores poorly. A perfect match would require 10.0; here, pervasive differences cap it low.
