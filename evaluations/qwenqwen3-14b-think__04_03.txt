The LLM answer reaches the correct conclusion, identifies the violated rule (Rule 3), and provides a clear justification referencing each relevant rule. However, compared to the ground truth, the answer is less thorough. It summarizes the compliance for Rules 1, 2, and 4 in one sentence rather than specifically referencing all requirements. It also does not detail the sequence of satisfaction as systematically as the ground truth table. Small omissions, such as not explicitly stating that Rule 2 requires VP to occur after **both** QE and RA due to "severity = High", and a less structured explanation result in a 1-point deduction for completeness and precision.
