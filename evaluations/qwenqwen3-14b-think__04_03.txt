The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No"), pinpoints the exact violation in Rule 3 (NA before RA), and accurately assesses satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4 with appropriate reasoning. It references all rules as required, with justifications that align closely with the ground truth (e.g., QE precedes RA for Rule 1; VP after RA, which implicitly covers after both QE and RA since order is met; CC after NA and VP). Minor deductions for not explicitly stating "once each" for QE/RA in Rule 1 (a small but omissions under strict evaluation) and using prose instead of a table format (slight structural difference from ground truth), but core content is nearly identical with no factual errors.
