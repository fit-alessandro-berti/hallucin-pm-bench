9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) (Decision Points)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes both decision points with high fidelity to the prompt and ground truth. Phrasing is nearly identical (e.g., conditions for skipping review and TriVote rule match exactly in substance), but minor deductions for small inaccuracies: (1) unnecessary "combined" qualifier for the risk rating (prompt implies a single outcome from inputs, not explicitly "combined"—this is a subtle over-interpretation); (2) "give approval" vs. ground truth/prompt's implication of formal "Approvals" or "record 'Approve'"; (3) "approved... fails" vs. ground truth's neutral "advance only when," which slightly alters the implied outcome tone without contradicting the rule. These small phrasing drifts warrant a 0.5-point deduction under strict criteria, though no hallucinations or omissions occur. One-sentence rule descriptions are adhered to.
  
- **Part b) (Documents)**: Exact match in listing all 9 documents in first-appearance order, with no additions, omissions, or hallucinations (e.g., no erroneous KYC/AML mentions). Minor deduction (0.5 points) for added descriptive commentary (e.g., "submitted with the application," "returned by the applicant"), which exceeds the ground truth's bare list format and introduces slight verbosity not requested in the prompt.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: Response is well-organized, directly addresses both parts without extraneous content impacting accuracy (the flowchart offer is polite but irrelevant— no deduction as it doesn't alter the core answer). No criminal/jailbreak issues. Total deductions reflect strictness on small errors (1.0 point total), resulting in 9.0 from a perfect 10.0.
