The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content for all three questions, with no errors, omissions, or fabrications. Minor formatting differences (e.g., extra explanatory text, code block usage, absence of dashes in Q3) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation criteria, as they do not alter the required outputs.
