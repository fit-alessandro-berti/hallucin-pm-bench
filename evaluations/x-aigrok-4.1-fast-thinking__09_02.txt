The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt's requirement for a one-sentence explanation, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps as the core issue. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (lacks explicit mention of "duration information," "event counts," or "start-to-completion intervals") and structural differences (e.g., bolded label vs. full declarative sentence), per strict evaluation criteria.
