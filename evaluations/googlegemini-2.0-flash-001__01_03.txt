5.5

The LLM answer is generally accurate, but it has several significant omissions and small errors. Below is a breakdown, strictly referencing the provided ground truth:

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM answer correctly identifies both primary decision points: the risk/amount check after Tri-Color-Risk-Check and the "TriVote" approval gate.
- The rule descriptions are mostly accurate and concise, but the answer slightly misstates the first one—saying the process goes "directly to the 'TriVote' decision gate" when technically the process is to skip a step (Manual-Underwriting-Review) based on the risk rating and amount, not to go "directly" to TriVote. This could lead to confusion.
- The LLM answer does not explicitly mention that if the condition is not met, the process proceeds to Manual-Underwriting-Review—a subtly incomplete description compared to the ground truth's more precise "otherwise it proceeds to that review."
- The Sustainability Officer's mandatory participation is not remarked upon, but as the question called for only summarizing the rule, this is a minor omission.

**b) Documents Required**

- The LLM lists:  
   1. Form 14B  
   2. Scorecard–Cyan  
   3. Scorecard–Magenta  
   4. Scorecard–Yellow  
   5. Deck Memo (**noting its conditionality**, though this is stylistic rather than wrong)  
   6. Offer Sheet 77  
   7. ID Matrix Declaration  
- **Omissions:**  
   - The answer **leaves out "Signed Offer Sheet 77"**—which is explicitly listed as a required returned document in step 8.
   - The answer **omits "Loan Dossier 2025"**, the required agreement document for finalization in step 9.
- The answer does not include any extraneous or hallucinated documents (good).

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is mostly correct in its identification and description of the decision points, but fails to list two critical required documents. Since the user's instruction emphasizes *utmost strictness* and significant point deductions for "small errors," these omissions are substantial. Likewise, minor inaccuracies in phrasing of the conditional logic contribute to further small point loss.

**Final strict score:** 5.5
