### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (partial credit, major deduction for inaccuracy):** The LLM correctly identifies the two decision points and accurately summarizes the TriVote rule (matching the ground truth's "at least two of three" logic, despite the prompt's phrasing about "approvals from all three" which implies voting by all but passage by two). However, the summary of the first decision point (Step 4) is fundamentally incorrect: it inverts the flow by stating the process "proceeds directly to TriVote *only if*" the condition (Low/Medium risk AND ≤ €250k), implying a branch where failure leads solely to Manual-Underwriting without continuation. In reality (per prompt and ground truth), the condition skips Step 5 but always leads to Step 6 afterward; the LLM's phrasing creates a false binary branch, diverging significantly from the ground truth's precise "bypasses ... otherwise proceeds to that review" (which implies continuation). This is a critical logical error, not a minor phrasing issue, warranting a severe deduction. Strict evaluation: ~50% accuracy here.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents List (low credit, deductions for omissions and extras):** The LLM lists 7 items in rough first-appearance order, correctly including Form 14B, the three Scorecards, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, and ID Matrix Declaration. However, it omits two required documents that first appear explicitly: "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (Step 8, distinct from the unsigned Offer Sheet 77 in Step 7) and "Loan Dossier 2025" (Step 9). This is a major incompleteness (missing ~22% of the 9 ground truth items). Additionally, the unnecessary "conditionally" qualifier for Deck Memo introduces extraneous detail not in the ground truth or prompt's "first appear" instruction, slightly bloating the list without justification. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML inventions), but omissions alone are disqualifying under strict criteria. ~55% accuracy here.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity:** The response is well-structured with bold headings and bullet points, mirroring the ground truth's format, and stays faithful to the prompt without extraneous content. Casual intro ("Okay, here's...") is minor but unprofessional. No policy violations or jailbreak issues. Total score reflects strict weighting: substantial differences in logic and completeness outweigh partial matches, averaging to a low-mid range.
