**6.0**

### Evaluation Summary (strict assessment):
- **Format**: Matches prompt perfectly (per-rule status + ≤20-word justification; all-caps overall). No deduction here. Ground truth uses table (unrequired).
- **R1**: Status match, justification equivalent (both note amount >€10k + approval sequence). Minor phrasing diff (negligible).
- **R2**: **Major error** - Status wrong (Compliant vs Violated); justification wrong (ignores R5-triggered new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07 15:10 as "last required approval"; Ship_Goods on 03-05 precedes it, violating "within 2 days *after*"). -3.0 points.
- **R3**: Status + justification match (Pay before Receive).
- **R4**: Status match, justification equivalent.
- **R5**: Status match, justification equivalent (notes pre-approval steps despite later approval).
- **R6**: Status + justification match.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).
- **Total**: 10 - 4.0 (heavy deduction for R2 status/error + missed rule interaction) = 6.0. Utmost strictness applied; single major rule misclassification = significant loss.
