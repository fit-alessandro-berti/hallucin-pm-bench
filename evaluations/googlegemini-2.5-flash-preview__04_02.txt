8.0

Rule-by-rule assessment:

**R1**
- LLM: Correctly judged as Compliant with essentially the same justification.  
**No penalty.**

**R2**
- LLM: Violation stated, but justification is partly inaccurate; claims Ship_Goods not within 2 days "due to subsequent violation of R5", which is imprecise. Properly, R2 is violated because the latest required approval (which is the new Manager_Approval after Change_Request, per R5) is on 2025-03-07, while Ship_Goods occurred on 2025-03-05, i.e., before approval, not delayed. So actually, Ship_Goods occurred before any "last required approval" after Change_Request: **the LLM captured the R5 interaction but its justification is ambiguous and not clearly stated as per ground truth**.
- **Penalty: -1.0 (ambiguous/unclear justification, although the verdict is correct and rationale is at least mentioned).**

**R3**
- Both say Violated and have essentially the same justification.
- **No penalty.**

**R4**
- Both say Not Applicable, haz = false.
- **No penalty.**

**R5**
- Both say Violated, LLM: "Change_Request after Finance_Approval (Mar 4); Ship_Goods (Mar 5) proceeded without new Manager_Approval."  
- Ground truth also mentions Pay_Invoice occurring before new Manager_Approval, which the LLM omits. **LLM only mentions Ship_Goods, not Pay_Invoice.**
- **Penalty: -0.5 (missing one event in the justification, but got the rule verdict correct).**

**R6**
- Both correct.
- **No penalty.**

**Overall result**
- Both correct.
- **No penalty.**

**Formatting**
- LLM’s format is nearly as requested, but it does not separate rules into a table (though that is not required). Wording is slightly longer than "≤ 20 words" in at least one case ("Violation of R5" in R2 is extraneous).

**Summary:**  
- Slight imprecision/ambiguity on R2 justification, and under-specification on R5 justification.
- All verdicts correct.

Thus, the score is **8.0** due to these small, but meaningful, justification errors.
