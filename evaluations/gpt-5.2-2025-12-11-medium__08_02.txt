The LLM answer is correct (Yes, same minimal sequence T1-T2-T7-T4-T5 demonstrating T5 before T3), with a solid explanation capturing the key logic (P1 branch fills P5 while P2 waits). However, under utmost strictness:
- Omits intermediate markings (M₁={P1,P2}, etc.), reducing rigor vs. ground truth's verifiable step-by-step proof.
- Explanation prose differs (longer, descriptive vs. concise path summary), placed under Q2 instead of Q1.
- Sequence presented as inline bracketed list vs. numbered with states.
- Minor structure mismatch (Answer 1/2 vs. Q1/Q2).

No factual errors, under 120 words, but differences in detail/presentation deduct 1.0.
