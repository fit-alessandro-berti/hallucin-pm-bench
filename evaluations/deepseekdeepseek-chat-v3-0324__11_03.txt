6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is structurally sound as a memo (~140 words), correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and waiting times, and uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations. Quantification of SLA excesses is accurate in both absolute and percentage terms, aligning with data (e.g., +300s for Legal/Risk, +60s for Credit), though the use of percentages (100%, 50%, 25%) introduces derived metrics not explicitly in the table, slightly deviating from strict grounding.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Order of activities**: LLM ranks by breach percentage (Risk first), while ground truth prioritizes by absolute impact/waiting time (Legal first)—a meaningful difference in "worst-performing" emphasis, costing ~1 point.
- **Derived percentages for waiting time** (e.g., 80%, 67%): Not in the table; these are calculations, violating "ground every sentence in the data" and inflating invention, costing ~0.5 points.
- **Recommendations**: Fundamentally different actions (e.g., LLM's "parallel processing" vs. ground truth's "rule-based pre-checks"; invented targets like "30% reduction" lack table data basis, unlike ground truth's more process-specific ideas). Actions are concrete but not matching, and LLM's are less "data-driven" without referencing cases/volumes directly, costing ~1.5 points.
- **Typos/incompleteness**: "for low to reduce to reduce queue" is erroneous and unprofessional, a small but significant flaw in a memo, costing ~0.5 points.
- **Extra content**: Closing sentence ("These actions address...") adds ungrounded narrative, exceeding "only the memo text" intent, costing ~0.5 points.
- **Minor mismatches**: Subject line phrasing, lack of total cases mention (ground truth invents "4 805" unsubstantiatedly, but LLM avoids invention here), and no end-to-end projection.

Similarities in core identification and format prevent a lower score, but cumulative differences (especially in recommendations and strict data adherence) yield 6.5—good but not exemplary fidelity to ground truth.
