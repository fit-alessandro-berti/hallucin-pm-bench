The LLM answer correctly identifies that the value cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps, aligning with the core reason in the ground truth. However, it is overly simplistic and lacks the ground truth's precise elaboration on the impossibility of computation, the specific absence of duration information and start-to-completion intervals, and the reliance on event counts alone, resulting in a deduction for incomplete explanatory depth despite the conciseness requirement.
