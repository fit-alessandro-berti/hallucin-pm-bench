The LLM answer proposes increasing the due date of the "Grant System Access" service task from 1 day to 3 days, justifying this as an accommodation for external-system delays. However, the ground truth answer requires reducing the due date of "Collect Equipment" from 5 days to 2 days, specifically to keep the onboarding process within a strict 3-day SLA. 

Major issues:
- The LLM answer chooses the wrong task and applies an opposite change (making the due date more lenient instead of stricter).
- The proposed change would likely worsen SLA breaches by allowing more time for completion, rather than ensuring tighter compliance.
- The rationale does not address the actual SLA requirement of completing the onboarding within 3 days.

Small credit is awarded for correctly providing a unified diff in the required format and making a single permissible edit, but the substantive recommendation is incorrect and would not resolve the SLA breach. Strict grading penalizes the choice of task, the direction of the change, and the mismatch with the intended compliance goal.
