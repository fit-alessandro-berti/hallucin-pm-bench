6.5

**Analysis:**

**Terminology Adherence (Vocabulary Policy):**
- The answer strictly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance". No forbidden terms are present. **(No deduction here.)**

**Structure and Content:**
- Format and role/column names are correct.
- No extra roles/tasks/columns; the structure matches the ground truth in terms of activities/roles.

**Major Issues (RACI Assignments):**
- **Receive Application:**  
  - LLM: AM (R/A), CO (I), FC/IT (blank)
  - Ground truth: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I)  
    → **Deduct:** CO should be Consulted, not just Informed; FC and IT are missing Informed.
- **KYC Review:**  
  - LLM: CO (R/A), AM (I)
  - Ground truth: CO (R), AM (A), FC (C), IT (I)  
    → **Deduct:** AM should be A (not just Informed), FC missing as Consulted, IT missing as Informed.
- **Order Vetting:**  
  - LLM: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (blank)
  - Ground truth: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I)  
    → **Deduct:** IT missing as Informed.
- **Payment Clearance:**  
  - LLM: FC (R/A), AM (I), IT (I)
  - Ground truth: FC (R), AM (A), CO (C), IT (I)  
    → **Deduct:** AM should be A (not just Informed), CO missing as Consulted.
- **Record Update:**  
  - LLM: IT (R/A), AM (I), FC (I)
  - Ground truth: IT (R), AM (C), CO (I), FC (C)  
    → **Deduct:** AM should be Consulted, CO missing as Informed, FC should be Consulted not Informed.
- **Notify Customer:**  
  - LLM: AM (R/A)
  - Ground truth: AM (R/A), CO (I), FC (I), IT (I)  
    → **Deduct:** Others missing as Informed.

**Other Notes:**
- The legend is correct.
- No unwarranted content.
- General adherence to the format is fine.

**Penalties:**
- **Persistent under-representation** of Consulted and Informed parties (in some cases omissions, in others wrong allocation).
- **Missing Informed/Consulted allocations** are not minor; for high-precision use, these are critical.
- **Some minor errors (e.g., conflation of Responsible & Accountable in some cases) are not catastrophic but systematic.**

**Conclusion:** The answer fully complies with forbidden/preferred vocabulary and format, but multiple, recurring, and significant errors in the RACI assignments — especially omitting C/I designations — are serious omissions for process mapping. This warrants a score well below 8.0. However, the overall process structure and terminology are correct, so a mid-range score is justified.

**Strict grade: 6.5**
