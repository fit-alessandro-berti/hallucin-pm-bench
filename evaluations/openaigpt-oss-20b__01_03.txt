6.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM correctly identifies and concisely expresses the two true decision points from the ground truth: the risk/amount conditional branch, and the TriVote approval gate.  
- However, it improperly introduces a **third, non-existent “Applicant confirmation gate”** at Step 8 (“Signed Offer Sheet 77” and “ID Matrix Declaration” required). The ground truth—and the process description—do NOT indicate this is a “decision point” or conditional branch; it’s a procedural step, not a workflow gate.  
- Even with its wording, the LLM describes both actual decision points acceptably (minor paraphrase only).
- The table format is extra, but not problematic by itself.

**Strictness:** The introduction of a spurious decision point is a major error, since part (a) explicitly asks for *every* decision point and no more; adding one is as serious as missing one.

---

**b) Documents (order of first appearance)**

- The LLM lists all nine documents in the correct order; no omissions, no hallucinations, correct naming.
- The slight expansion (“applicant’s signed version of the offer”) is accurate and not penalized.
- The summary at the end is correct.
- No errors in this section.

---

**Summary:**  
- **Major deduction** (–3 points from 10) for inventing an extra decision point.  
- No other errors (document list and core answers otherwise correct), but instructions call for each small mistake to cost significantly.

**Final score:** 6.0
