The LLM's answer correctly identifies that the fact is inaccurate and cites relevant cases (1001 and 1003) where "Update_Inventory" comes before "Authorize_Refund", which is good. However, it does *not* mention Case 1002, where "Update_Inventory" does not occur at allâ€”an important point, since this further disproves the "always" part of the claim. The answer also does not explicitly say that "Authorize_Refund" never immediately precedes "Update_Inventory" in any case, which would be a more direct rebuttal. There are no clear misstatements, but the omission of the crucial evidence from Case 1002 and lack of strong summary reduce the grade significantly per the strict criteria.
