**10.0**

The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth in all rule statuses (**Compliant**, **Violated**, **Not Applicable**), overall result (**NON-COMPLIANT**), and justification intent/accuracy. All justifications are ≤20 words, factually correct, and capture the violations equivalently (e.g., R5 cites a valid example "Ship_Goods"; omission of additional examples like Pay_Invoice is not required for correctness). Minor phrasing/date format differences (e.g., "03-06" vs. "06-Mar") are stylistic, not errors. Strict evaluation confirms no violations of rules or format.
