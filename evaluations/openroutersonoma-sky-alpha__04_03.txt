9.0

**Evaluation Commentary:**  
The LLM answer is very concise and accurate, properly stating "No" and referencing each rule individually with correct justifications. The only notable (minor) differences from the ground truth are:

- The gold standard answer provides a more explicit, structured tabular format and begins with a summary sentence (“No – the trace is not compliant”). The LLM omits the summary sentence but makes the decision clear.
- The LLM’s justification, while correct and referencing all rules accurately, could have made it clearer in Rule 3 that “NA must wait until *both* QE and RA are finished”—it states the fact correctly but with less explicit wording compared to the gold answer.
- There is a slight difference in wording on Rule 4, but the logical analysis is equivalent.

There are no substantive errors, but the small omissions and less explicit coverage compared to the expected gold standard (e.g., lack of an explicit summary sentence and table, slightly less emphasis on the *requirement* in rule 3) warrant deduction. Thus, the answer must lose one full point for highest strictness per your guidance.

**Final Score: 9.0**
