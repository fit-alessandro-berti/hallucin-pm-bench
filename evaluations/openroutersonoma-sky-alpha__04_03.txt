The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in its core assessment (correctly identifies "No" compliance due to Rule 3 violation, with accurate satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4). Justifications are precise, reference all rules, and align closely in reasoning (e.g., Rule 3 explanation captures the same violation of NA preceding RA). Minor deductions for format differences (bulleted list with bold labels vs. table structure) and slight wording variations (e.g., omission of explicit "overall trace is non-compliant" summary phrase), which introduce small presentational divergences under strict evaluation. No factual errors.
