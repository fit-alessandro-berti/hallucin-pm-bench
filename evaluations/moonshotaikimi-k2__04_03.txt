The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately flags the violation of Rule 3 (NA occurring before RA), which is the core issue per the ground truth. However, it introduces major errors by incorrectly violating Rule 1 (falsely claiming QE and RA must be "immediately consecutive" with no interventions, when the rule only requires order and once each) and Rule 2 (misinterpreting prerequisites tied to invalid Rule 1 logic, despite VP correctly following both QE and RA). Rule 4's assessment aligns but is undermined by the "moot" commentary. These interpretive additions create substantial deviations from the ground truth's precise, rule-by-rule satisfaction assessments, warranting a significant deduction for inaccuracy and overreach.
