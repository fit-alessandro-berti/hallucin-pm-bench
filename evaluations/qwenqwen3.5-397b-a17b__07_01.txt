8.5

The LLM answer is factually accurate, correctly identifies all added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), the removed task (`send_rma_label`), and the gateway change (`gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), with no speculation or extras. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Format mismatches** (significant deductions): Item listings reverse the ground truth order (id first vs. name first with "id = `id`"), use different bullet styles (• vs. *), and lack "id = " phrasing or version labels "(v1)/(v2)".
- **Gateway phrasing**: Concise arrow notation vs. explicit "changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)" with bolding (-1.0).
- **Minor diffs**: No trailing note, different code/emphasis styling (-0.5 total).

Content perfect (10.0 base), deductions for presentation differences yield 8.5.
