9.5

1. The count answer is exactly correct: "1 occurrence" matches the ground truth.

2. The percentage is calculated correctly and explained; notation is fine ("5.56 %").

3. The case list is correct: only A1002 is listed.

4. The two sampling-related reasons are both justified and clearly different:  
   - "Temporal coverage bias" matches "Temporal bias" from ground truth, and the definition fits.
   - "Small-sample/selection bias" covers both small sample size and some notion of non-representativeness.
   - The answer avoids information not derivable from the log.

The only reason for a minor penalty is that "selection bias" is slightly more speculative than optimal; "case-mix" or "survivorship" are not directly called out. Also, the precise wording of the percentage could ideally match the mathematical formula style given, but this is an extremely minor flaw.

Overall, the answer is nearly perfect in fidelity, detail, and strictness, losing only 0.5 points for minor differences in terminology and not listing calculation as visibly as ground truth.

**Score: 9.5**
