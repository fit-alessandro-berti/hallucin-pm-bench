6.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM answer lists three decision points instead of the two actual gates/branches in the process. The first "decision" identified ("Risk Assessment (Tri-Color-Risk-Check): classify as Low/Medium/High") is simply an assessment, not a gate or branch; the branching occurs in step 4 after this check. Strictly, this is an error: only actual branches/gates should be identified per the question and ground truth, so this is extraneous.
- The LLM correctly describes the conditional skip after the risk check, using appropriate language and the correct threshold.
- The LLM describes the "TriVote" correctly, with the two-out-of-three rule, and mentions all roles as per the description.
- But overall, mentioning the risk assignment itself as a gate is a misclassification—this represents a misunderstanding of "decision point" and overstating steps.

**b) Documents**

- The LLM omits the three required "Scorecard" documents (Scorecard–Cyan, –Magenta, –Yellow), which the process says are inputs required for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check—these are explicitly listed in the ground truth as required documents and so their omission is a major factual loss.
- The LLM lists "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as required (correct) but does not make explicit that this is a separate required document from "Offer Sheet 77"—in the ground truth, both are listed, and order matters.
- The ordering given by the LLM is otherwise correct for the documents it does list.

**No hallucinations** (i.e., does not mention non-existent KYC or AML docs).

**Deduction rationale:**
- -2 points for missing all three Scorecard docs (major actual omissions—minimum three required docs omitted).
- -1 point for treating the "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" itself as a decision point rather than just its risk-based skip.
- -0.5 point for slightly fuzzy handling of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a document (combined with Offer Sheet 77; minor error).
- -0.5 point for minor slackness in not using the prompt’s exact wording ("two of three" vs. "any two approvals out of three"—not really an error, but for strictness).

**Total: 6.0**

The answer is mostly accurate for the major flow (skipping manual underwriting, TriVote logic) but omits important required documents and misidentifies a step as a decision point, so it merits a clear but not failing deduction.
