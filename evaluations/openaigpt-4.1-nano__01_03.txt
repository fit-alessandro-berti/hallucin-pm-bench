4.2

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, focusing on accuracy, completeness, fidelity to the process description, and absence of additions or omissions. Differences, even minor, result in significant deductions as per instructions. Total score reflects weighted penalties: ~50% for part (a) (extra content and incomplete alignment) and ~50% for part (b) (major omissions and incomplete listing).

#### Part (a): Decision Points (Score: 5.0/10)
- **Strengths (partial credit):** The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two actual decision points/gates from the ground truth:
  - The risk-based skip (matches ground truth #1 closely: same condition, rule, and outcome phrasing).
  - The TriVote gate (matches ground truth #2: "any two approvals out of three suffice" aligns with "at least two... record 'Approve'", as the process uses "approvals").
- **Major Errors/Deductions (significant loss):**
  - Adds an extraneous "decision point" (#1: Risk Assessment/Tri-Color-Risk-Check), describing the classification itself as a decision, but this is not a gate or conditional branch per the prompt/process—it's merely the input/step leading to the actual branch (the skip in step 4). Ground truth omits this entirely, treating it as process execution, not a decision. This inflates the list (3 vs. 2 points) and misinterprets "decision point (gate or conditional branch)".
  - Phrasing deviations, e.g., "less than or equal to €250,000" vs. ground truth's exact "≤ €250 000" (minor but strict deduction); TriVote lists roles correctly but doesn't use ground truth's precise "record 'Approve'" (small wording mismatch).
- Overall: Incomplete and bloated; ~50% deduction for extra/irrelevant content and minor phrasing issues.

#### Part (b): Documents List (Score: 3.5/10)
- **Strengths (partial credit):** Correctly includes Form 14B (first), Deck Memo (step 5), Offer Sheet 77 (step 7), ID Matrix Declaration (step 8), and Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9). Order of these is accurate based on first appearance. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML/credit-bureau mentions, avoiding the noted pitfall).
- **Major Errors/Deductions (heavy loss):**
  - **Critical omissions:** Entirely misses the three Scorecard inputs (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicitly "Inputs" (i.e., required documents) in step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) and first appear there—before Deck Memo. Ground truth lists them as #2–4. This is a substantial gap (3/9 items missing), violating "all documents" and order requirement.
  - Incomplete handling of Offer Sheet 77: Ground truth separates "Offer Sheet 77" (#6, prepared in step 7) from "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (#7, requested in step 8), treating the signed version as a distinct required document. LLM merges them (mentions "Signed" in description but lists only unsigned as #3), undercounting and disrupting order/completeness.
  - Result: Only ~6/9 items effectively covered (with one partially mangled); major deduction for incompleteness (~60% loss), plus order/granularity issues.

#### Overall Assessment
- The LLM captures the core process but introduces inaccuracies (extra decision in a) and glaring omissions (scorecards in b), diverging meaningfully from ground truth. No criminal/jailbreak issues here, but strictness demands low score for these flaws. If perfect, 10.0; each omission/misinterpretation docks ~1–2 points.
