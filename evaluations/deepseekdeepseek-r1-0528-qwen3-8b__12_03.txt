The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise justification by citing the two relevant violating CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with accurate activity sequences and timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns well with the task requirements and the log evidence. However, under utmost strictness, it loses a full point for lacking the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case analysis (e.g., no coverage of compliant cases C001 and C003, and no tabular or explicit "all cases reviewed" structure), which makes it slightly less thorough despite being factually error-free.
