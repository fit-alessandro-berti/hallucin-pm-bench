The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content, structure, and factual accuracy for all three questions. Q1 is identical (3). Q2 is identical in sequence and separator (minor escaping in ground truth is irrelevant to semantics). Q3 lists the exact distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock"), properly alphabetized, with no extras, misses, or ordering errors. The explanatory analysis is accurate and does not introduce hallucinations. Formatting differences (e.g., code blocks vs. table) do not affect the core answers. No deductions applied.
