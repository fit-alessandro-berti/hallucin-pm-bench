7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes: added tasks (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive. It adheres strictly to the required headings with exact phrasing (including • bullets) and lists only relevant differences without speculation, matching the prompt's structure. No extraneous information is added.
- **Weaknesses (point deductions)**: 
  - For added and removed tasks, the LLM uses only the `id` attributes (e.g., `check_vip`), while the ground truth includes the full `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status") alongside the IDs for completeness. The prompt specifies "use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML," which could encompass both `id` and `name` (as they define the task elements), making this an omission of key XML details (-1.0).
  - Gateway change phrasing is concise but lacks the ground truth's explicit versioning ("from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), reducing clarity on the directional change across versions (-0.5).
  - Minor formatting differences: LLM uses plain text lists under • headings, while ground truth employs **bold** headings, * bullets, and backticks for IDs, plus italics/bolding for emphasis. This deviates from the ground truth's presentation style (-0.5), though it aligns better with the prompt's plain • format.
  - No inclusion of the ground truth's closing note ("*(No other differences should be reported.)*"), but this is not required by the prompt, so no deduction.
- **Overall Strictness**: The core facts are accurate (no factual errors), but the lack of full task names and verbose gateway details creates noticeable differences in informativeness and fidelity to the ground truth's structure/content. This warrants a solid but imperfect score; perfect alignment would be 10.0.
