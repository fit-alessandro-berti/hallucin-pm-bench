The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring A), sorts them alphabetically both within pairs (C before Q; P before S) and overall (C-pair before P-pair), uses the one-per-line format, and employs the specified "Task_X  —  Task_Y" structure with appropriate (consistent) spacing matching the example's indicated two spaces before/after the em dash. No extra or missing pairs. The sole minor discrepancy is lack of extra padding spaces in the ground truth's second line for visual alignment (5+ spaces after "Materials" vs. LLM's 2), which is a trivial whitespace difference not mandated by the prompt's format spec. Under utmost strictness, this small formatting variance deducts 0.5 points.
