6.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correctness (activities/numbers/ranking; major deduction)**: Activities are the correct top 3 (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability). Numbers quoted verbatim and accurately for both avg and 95th percentile. **However, ranking is incorrect**: Strictly by Avg_Waiting_h (36.5 > 12.2 > 7.8), #2 must be Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability. LLM swaps them, contradicting its own phrasing ("highest average... waiting times") and prompt's "ranks #1 (worst) → #3 strictly by waiting-time". This is a significant error (-3.0 points).
- **No unwarranted content**: Perfect compliance—no service-time, throughput, or other activities mentioned (+1.0).
- **Action relevance**: All 3 actions are concrete, tied to waiting-time issues, promise ≥20% cut (≥40%, ~25%, ≥30%). Plausible but less "data-driven" than ground truth (no "pilot tests" or "estimated" evidence cited; feels invented) (-1.0).
- **Format/conciseness**: Crisp memo format ≤150 words (~110 words), executive-appropriate. Differs from ground truth's minimal bullets but meets "crisp executive memo" spec (0 deduction).
- **Overall differences from ground truth**: Swapped ranking, different actions, added headers/intro/closing. Core elements present but flawed execution justifies 6.0 under utmost strictness.
