The LLM answer correctly concludes that the fact is inaccurate, providing a clear short justification and citing all relevant cases. The following points are handled well:
- It identifies that in case 1001, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund", not after.
- It notices that in case 1003, a different order (with “Quality_Check” in between) means "Authorize_Refund" does not precede "Update_Inventory".
- It mentions that in case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not occur, making the claim unsupportable for that case.

However, some deductions include:
- The explanation for case 1003 is not fully precise. In truth, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Quality_Check" and both these occur before "Authorize_Refund", so "Authorize_Refund" is not immediately before "Update_Inventory" in any sense, but the LLM frames this as “Update_Inventory occurs before Quality_Check which then precedes Authorize_Refund,” which could be clearer.
- The LLM does not explicitly state, as in the ground truth, that "in none of the three cases does 'Authorize_Refund' immediately precede 'Update_Inventory'", which is the crisp disproof.
- The formatting, structure, and explicitness are less sharp and detailed than the ground truth.

Overall, while the core logic and cases are cited, the answer could be more direct and precise—especially regarding the clear, succinct refutation. Hence, a deduction for lack of explicitness and some small ambiguity in the explanation for case 1003.
