The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying the fact as inaccurate with evidence from cases 1001 and 1003 showing reversed or non-matching order. It cites case IDs and activities as required, addresses the "immediately" aspect relevantly (e.g., noting the intervening Quality_Check in 1003), and concludes properly that "always" fails due to counterexamples. Differences from ground truth are minor: (1) narrative vs. bulleted structure (not substantive); (2) no line citations (omitted but not required by prompt); (3) treatment of case 1002 as "inconclusive" rather than explicitly "disproved" (a nuanced interpretive difference, but LLM's view aligns better with strict predecessor logic for "always occurs before," avoiding overstatement). No factual errors in LLM; ground truth slightly overreaches on 1002. Strict deduction for phrasing and structure variances.
