The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1, claiming "No" when the ground truth is "Yes," reversing the core assessment. Its explanation for Q2 ignores the alternative path (T2 → T7 → T4) that populates P5 without firing T3, preserving the token in P2 for T5. This flaw demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the Petri net's structure and reachable markings, resulting in zero alignment with the ground truth. No partial credit is warranted due to the strict evaluation criteria and total inversion of the factual outcome.
