10.0

The LLM answer is semantically and structurally identical to the ground truth. It correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B (P1, P2, P3) with exact task names, in the correct order, using numbered lines and comma separation. The only differences are minor whitespace variations after commas (absent in LLM answer, present in ground truth), which do not constitute functional errors under the prompt's requirements. No extraneous content, sequential tasks, or references to other processes are included. Perfect match under strict evaluation.
