3.5

**Detailed Scoring and Reasoning:**

**Q1**
LLM: 3 distinct cases: C001, C002, C003.  
Ground Truth: 3  
→ Score: 1.0/1.0 (correct)

**Q2**  
LLM: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
Ground Truth: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  

**Errors in LLM answer:**
- Adds extra "Ship_Order" at the end (it doesn't exist in order).
- Puts "Ship_Order" before "Arrange_Delivery", which contradicts event timestamps and order.  
- Orders is: Receive_Order (line 2), Check_Stock (line 5), Arrange_Delivery (line 8), Ship_Order (line 10).

**Severity:** The entire sequence is not just slightly off but fundamentally shuffled and contains a hallucinated extra activity.
→ Score: 0.5/4.0 (major error)

**Q3**
LLM:  
Check_Stock  
Receive_Order  

Ground Truth:  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock  

**Errors in LLM answer:**
- Misses "Arrange_Delivery" (which immediately precedes "Ship_Order" for C002).
- Wrongly includes "Receive_Order", which never immediately precedes "Ship_Order".
- Not alphabetically ordered, but that is secondary to factual inaccuracy.

**Severity:** Both factual and ordering error.
→ Score: 0.5/5.0

**Summary:**  
A1: Correct (1.0)  
A2: Serious order and hallucination (0.5)  
A3: Incorrect activities listed (0.5)

**Total:** (1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5) / 3 ≈ 0.67 (out of 1 per question), scaled to max 10: 3.5 (rounded for clarity and with strictness as specified).

**Justification:**  
Although it identified the correct number of cases, both A2 and A3 show substantial misunderstandings and hallucinations, which (as instructed) warrant a significant deduction for each extra or misplaced element. Thus, a score of 3.5 reflects the strict grading as required.
