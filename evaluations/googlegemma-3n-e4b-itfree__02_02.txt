2.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Scoring Rationale):
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth (3 distinct cases). Full credit: +3.3 points (out of 10 total, assuming ~1/3 per question).
- **Q2**: Major factual errors and hallucination. The sequence incorrectly inserts an extra/duplicated "Ship_Order" too early, misorders "Arrange_Delivery" (it occurs after "Check_Stock" but before the final "Ship_Order"), and fabricates a non-existent transition. Ground truth sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order. This is a complete misrepresentation of the log for C002 (events at lines 2, 5, 8, 10). No credit: 0 points.
- **Q3**: Multiple errors. Lists incorrect activity ("Receive_Order" does not immediately precede "Ship_Order" in any case; actual distinct predecessors are only "Arrange_Delivery" for C002 and "Check_Stock" for C001/C003). Misses "Arrange_Delivery" entirely. Not alphabetically ordered (should be Arrange_Delivery first, then Check_Stock). Formatting minor (no bullets, but prompt allows "one per line"), but content is fabricated/wrong. No credit: 0 points.

**Total Score**: 3.3 (rounded down to 2.0 for strictness on partial credit; small errors like ordering alone would deduct heavily, but hallucinations dominate). The LLM answer shows significant deviation from the log, treating it as unreliable.
