6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) and accurately quantifies SLA excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) alongside waiting times, aligning closely with the ground truth's core analysis. However, several differences reduce the score under strict criteria:

- **Structure and Format (major deduction, -2.0 points)**: Lacks proper memo headers (To/From/Subject) present in the ground truth, starting abruptly with "**Executive Memo:**". It uses bullet points for both activity identification and recommendations, violating the instruction to "use bullet points *only* for the recommendations". Includes extraneous elements like opening dashes (---) and a misplaced \boxed{} section with redundant text, which contravenes "Return **only** the memo text".

- **Content Depth and Specificity (moderate deduction, -1.0 points)**: Quantifies excesses but omits explicit reference to "average throughput" vs. SLA (e.g., ground truth specifies "average throughput **900 s** vs. 600 s SLA"), making it less precise. Recommendations are listed in bullets as required but are generic and minimally data-driven (e.g., "increase capacity or streamline" lacks grounding in table metrics like cases or times; contrasts with ground truth's more targeted actions like "rule-based pre-checks" or "add one risk analyst"). No mention of total cases or projections, missing ground truth's contextual framing.

- **Length and Style (minor deduction, -0.5 points)**: Under 150 words (~100), while ground truth meets the approximate length. Adds an unneeded closing sentence ("These actions aim to..."), altering tone without matching ground truth's conclusive projection.

Overall, the answer captures the essential data-grounded identification but deviates significantly in formatting, adherence to bullet-point rules, and recommendation concreteness, warranting a mid-range score despite no factual errors in metrics.
