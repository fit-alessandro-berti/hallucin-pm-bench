8.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring breakdown):
- **Core identification & quantification (40% weight)**: Perfect match—same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment in same order), exact SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s), throughput/waiting times cited identically from data. No inventions. (+40/40)
- **Structure & formatting (20% weight)**: Memo format with To/Subject solid; bullets *only* for recommendations (complies). Minor deductions for missing "From:", different Subject phrasing, no bold on times, no "**Recommended actions**" header, and straight bullets vs. headed bullets. (-1.2/20 → 18.8/20)
- **Introduction/analysis (15% weight)**: Data-grounded; correctly ties to SLA breaches + high waits. Deductions for invented interpretations ("two-thirds", "67% of cycle time"—calculated but not in data/table), no total cases (~4805 sum), wordier phrasing vs. GT's concise "highlights... largest queues". (-2.3/15 → 12.7/15)
- **Recommendations (20% weight)**: One concrete, data-driven action per activity in bullets; all reference specific data (e.g., 600s wait). Major deduction for completely different content vs. GT (general staff reallocation/automation/investigate vs. GT's bypass/add staff/heuristic + €25k invention). Still compliant with prompt, but differs significantly from GT. (-5.4/20 → 14.6/20)
- **Overall compliance/word count/policy (5% weight)**: ~150 words; only memo text; no absent activities/metrics; no extra inventions like GT's "35%" projection or "April 2025". (+5/5)
- **Total**: 40 + 18.8 + 12.7 + 14.6 + 5 = 91/100 → **8.2/10**. High due to flawless core data/selection; penalized strictly for phrasing, extras, and rec differences per instructions.
