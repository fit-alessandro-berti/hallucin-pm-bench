The LLM answer fundamentally misinterprets the event-log data by claiming insufficient information or lack of sequence data, when the log explicitly shows the opposite order (Update_Inventory before Authorize_Refund in cases 1001 and 1003) or absence (case 1002), directly disproving the "always" claim. This is a complete failure to analyze the provided evidence, resulting in no alignment with the ground truth verdict of inaccuracy or its evidence-based justification. Even minor scrutiny reveals the error, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
