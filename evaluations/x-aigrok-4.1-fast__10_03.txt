**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (strong match, +partial credit)**: All four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") used exactly once each with no synonyms or leaks. However, derived activity names deviate (e.g., "Compliance Officer approval" vs. ground truth "**Compliance Officer Approval**"; "Release funds" vs. "**Release Funds**"; added "Notify originating analyst" – casing, bolding, and phrasing must match strictly).
- **Activities (major violations, -severe penalty)**: Added unauthorized activity ("Notify originating analyst"), violating "do not ... add activities." Derived names not exact matches (casing, bolding absent). Covers 7 rows vs. ground truth 6; no merging/renaming respected for core 4 but fails on rest.
- **RACI assignments (near-total mismatch, -severe penalty)**: Systemic errors across nearly all cells (e.g., Intake Vetting: Front "R" vs. "**R, A**"; CompA "A" vs. "C"; missing "–" and "I"). KYC/AML: CompA "R/A" vs. "**R, A**" + missing "C"/"I". Risk Scoring: CompA "R/A" vs. "R" + missing "C"/"A"/"I". Approval: CompO "A" vs. "**R, A**"; Front empty vs. "I"; Treas "I" vs. "–". Release: Front "I" ✓ (minor); but CompA empty vs. "C"; CompO "I" vs. "C"; Treas "R" vs. "**R, A**". Extra row irrelevant/wrong.
- **Formatting/notation (multiple errors, -significant penalty)**: "R/A" vs. "**R, A**" (wrong delimiter, no bold); empty cells vs. "–"; no bolding on activities/roles; inconsistent casing; table structure basic but imprecise.
- **Overall**: Basic structure and vocab salvage minor points, but additions, mismatches, and formatting errors compound to >90% deviation. Strict policy demands perfection; small errors (e.g., notation, casing) deduct heavily, major ones (additions, RACI) catastrophic. Equivalent to ~20% fidelity.
