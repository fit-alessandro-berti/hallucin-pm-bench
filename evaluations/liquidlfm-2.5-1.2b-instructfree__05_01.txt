The LLM answer fails entirely: it proposes adding a new "exclusive gate" (unpermitted new gateway, not listed in allowed changes: only events/timers/modify attributes/reconnect flows), an undefined "validation flow" (implies new elements), places it "at the end" (post-Triage, violating SLA timing to *reach* Triage in 48h), provides no escalation mechanism tied to submission, ignores element IDs (e.g., no "Task_Triage"), and doesn't reuse/connect existing flows correctly. Ground truth uses permitted interrupting timer on "Task_Receive" to bypass to "Task_Triage" precisely. Major violations on accuracy, constraints, and solution efficacy.
