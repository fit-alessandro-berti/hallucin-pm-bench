The LLM answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, matching the ground truth verbatim. It also accurately captures the gateway type change for Gateway_ReviewNeeded. However, it omits the second gateway type change for Gateway_Payment (exclusive â†’ parallel), which is a verifiable difference present in the XML snippets. This significant omission under the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES heading results in an incomplete summary, warranting a deduction despite the otherwise precise adherence to format and instructions. Minor formatting consistencies (e.g., spacing in the ground truth) do not impact the score further.
