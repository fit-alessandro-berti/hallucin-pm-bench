The LLM answer missed the functional change for Gateway_Payment under "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" (exclusive â†’ parallel), which is clearly indicated in the XML difference and the ground truth. The remaining headings and task entries are correct and complete. Since the prompt asks for all verifiable differences and strictness is needed, omitting a gateway type change is a significant error resulting in notable point loss, but the rest of the response is otherwise perfect regarding formatting and content.
