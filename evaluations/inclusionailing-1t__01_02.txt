### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in structure, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt's requirements (e.g., using exact activity names like "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)"; avoiding standard loan terminology; correctly listing all six required documents without additions). It faithfully summarizes the three key decision points and provides clear, concise descriptions that align with the process flow.

However, under strict evaluation, several differences from the ground truth warrant point deductions:
- **Missing flow context (significant deduction: -1.0)**: The ground truth explicitly positions each decision point in the sequence (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for #1; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for #2). The LLM omits this, making the summary less precise about the process's sequential nature, which is central to the prompt's emphasis on "exact terminology and flow."
- **Phrasing and detail variations in decision points (moderate deduction: -0.5)**: 
  - #1: LLM's description is functionally identical but rephrases without the ground truth's conditional arrow notation (⇒) or exact "tie-break" phrasing.
  - #2: LLM uses "routes... to the Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" vs. ground truth's "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval"; also omits the precise "< €15 000" vs. "≥ €15 000" formatting.
  - #3: LLM adds extraneous detail ("meeting or exceeding the €15,000 threshold after prior steps clear"), which is implied but not in the ground truth's succinct "the board votes **Approve** or **Reject**," introducing slight redundancy.
- **Documents list (minor deduction: -0.3)**: The list is complete and matches the system prompt's details (e.g., LLM correctly includes "template" for CIS and "single pay-stub or tax slip," which the ground truth abbreviates). However, the ground truth uses numbering and adds a clarifying note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") that reinforces the non-standard process; LLM lacks this, and minor phrasing diffs (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)") are present. Structure differs (bullets vs. numbered), but content is near-identical.

No major errors (e.g., wrong documents or invented terms), but the omissions in flow precision and minor inconsistencies prevent a perfect score. The answer is effective and prompt-compliant overall, justifying a high but not maximum grade.
