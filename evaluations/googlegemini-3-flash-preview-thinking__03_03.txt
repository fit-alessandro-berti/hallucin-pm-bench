**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment vs. Ground Truth)
The LLM answer is semantically *mostly* equivalent to the ground truth (correct loop for incomplete claims, parallel split/join for step 4, two end events, required gateways, all prefix "wrc_", no invented escalations/errors), warranting a baseline above 5.0. However, with **utmost strictness**, significant deductions for differences:

- **Major deduction (-2.0)**: **Extra/hallucinated task + flows** (`wrc_task_check_eligibility` "checks warranty eligibility", `wrc_flow3`, `wrc_gw_eligibility` incoming). Ground truth omits this (direct `wrc_sf5` complete_gw → warranty_gw), treating step 3 gw as the decision without separate task. LLM adds unminimal element altering flow (extra sequential step), violating "minimal-yet-complete" expectation and rubric for extra tasks/flows.
- **Medium deductions (-1.0 total)**:
  - Task/gw/end names differ (e.g., start "online warranty claim" vs. "Online warranty claim submitted"; ends "Process ended (Rejected)" vs. "Rejected"; gw "Is claim complete?" vs. "Claim complete?"). Not verbatim-equivalent where ground sets precedent.
  - Parallel task names shortened/non-verbatim per prompt ("Create shipment order" omits "for the replacement unit"; same for pickup)—matches ground's error but still deviates from prompt's "verbatim" rule.
  - Invented descriptive gw/flow names (e.g., "Split Parallel Activities", "within warranty") vs. ground's minimal ("Yes"/"No" or none).
- **Minor deductions (-0.5 total)**: All IDs differ systematically (`wrc_task_validate` vs. `wrc_validate`); extra comments (`<!-- -->`); verbose ( ~100 lines vs. 34); superfluous xmlns/targetNamespace.
- **No omissions**: LLM includes all ground truth elements + extra.

Core BPMN is valid/self-contained and renders a near-identical diagram (extra task is minor semantic addition), but strict rubric demands heavy penalty for extras, non-matching names/IDs, and non-minimal structure. Equivalent whitespace/ID-only variants get 10.0; this has substantive diffs.
