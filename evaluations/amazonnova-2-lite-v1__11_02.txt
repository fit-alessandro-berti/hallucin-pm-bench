**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), matching ground truth. Memo is concise (~140 words <200), structured as executive brief, cites table data strictly (no hallucinations or absent activities), provides one recommendation per activity.
- **Major Errors/Differences (significant deductions)**:
  - **Explanations incomplete/miss critical metrics** (-1.5): 
    - Request_Documents: Ignores massive 150 min wait (worst by far) and throughput drop (190 vs. 270 prior); fixates on rework (22%) and SLA (5.5%), diluting "why" vs. ground truth's bottleneck focus.
    - Review_Documents: Omits longest processing (25 min, table-high) and 30 min wait; emphasizes SLA/rework/variability (valid but secondary).
    - Initial_Assessment: Fair (cites 18/12 min waits/processing), but lacks upstream "feeding congestion" tie-in.
  - **Recommendations less concrete/data-driven** (-1.0): Vague/generic (e.g., "redesign templates", "standardized guidelines/training", "re-allocate staff") vs. ground truth's precise, measurable actions (e.g., "digital requests...halve rework", "AI-assisted...trim variability"). Not tied as tightly to specific metrics.
  - **Minor issues** (-0.3): No projected impacts (ground truth bonus); subjective phrasing ("worst overall", "normal ranges") not data-differentiated; small formatting (no underscores).
- **Overall**: Functionally meets task but diverges on precision/depth of table-based reasoning (core rubric), warranting mid-high score under strictness.
