7.5

**Justification:**  
The LLM answer correctly identifies the changes, but several issues prevent a higher score:

- It lists only the task IDs under "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" instead of both the task names and IDs, as shown in the ground truth. This is a significant omission, as the prompt and ground truth both explicitly use names and IDs.
- For the gateway type changes, the LLM uses a shorthand ("changed from *exclusiveGateway* (v1) to *inclusiveGateway* (v2)") rather than the precise format in the ground truth ("`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)"), and uses italics/markdown inconsistently.
- Category headings are correct, and no spurious differences are listed.

Given these errors, especially the omission of task names, a 2.5-point penalty is warranted for each: added tasks (lack of names), removed tasks (lack of names), and minor markdown inconsistency for the gateway change. This results in a score of 7.5.
