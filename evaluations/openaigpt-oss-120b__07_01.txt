6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core factual differences correctly (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, it deviates from the ground truth in several ways that warrant point deductions under strict criteria:

- **Task descriptions**: Significant error—lists only task IDs (e.g., "- check_vip"), while the ground truth provides full names from the XML (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," and names are explicit attributes; omitting them makes the response incomplete and less factual, losing ~2 points.
  
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses "-" bullets instead of "*" as in ground truth; no backticks for IDs in tasks or gateway; inconsistent bold/italic for gateway types (* vs. **). Headings lack the exact "•" prefix specified in the prompt (though neither fully matches, this is a shared minor flaw). These small format errors deduct ~1 point total.

- **Extra content**: Ground truth includes a clarifying note ("*(No other differences should be reported.)*"), which the LLM omits; while not required, its absence slightly reduces completeness (~0.5 point loss).

No speculation or extraneous details in LLM answer, which aligns with the prompt. Overall, core accuracy is good (70-80% match), but strictness on completeness and presentation pulls it down to 6.5.
