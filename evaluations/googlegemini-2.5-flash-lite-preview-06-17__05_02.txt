The LLM answer violates core rules by reordering XML elements (implying additions/deletions of flow positions) and modifying more than one sequenceFlow attribute without strictly reversing just one, resulting in an invalid BPMN structure with disconnected tasks (e.g., no incoming flow to Sign Contract after changes); the diff is not a clean single hunk, the rationale addresses a non-compliant structural reorder instead of the expected dueDate attribute tweak, and it fails to ensure SLA compliance within the 3-day limit as per the ground truth's focused, rule-adherent adjustment to Collect Equipment's dueDate.
