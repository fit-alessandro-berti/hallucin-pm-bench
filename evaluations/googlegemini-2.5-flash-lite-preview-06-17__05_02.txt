The LLM answer makes a major structural change by altering two `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>` targets: it reroutes the flow so that "Grant System Access" can occur before "Sign Contract", and as a result, changes the order of process stepsâ€”contradicting the explicit rules (must not add or delete activities, only reverse a single sequence flow if absolutely necessary). The answer also leaves unnecessary duplicate flows (e.g., duplicate `<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_6">`). 

Furthermore, the rationale discusses reordering for logical due dates, but this is not a direct SLA-compliance fix and ignores the far simpler (and rule-abiding) solution: simply tightening the due date on an existing activity ("Collect Equipment") as shown in the ground truth. 

The ground truth makes one precise, attribute-only change, and provides a clear rationale. The LLM answer instead restructures control flow, oversteps constraints, and is unnecessarily complex. For these serious failures to comply with the instructions and to identify the correct minimal fix, a strict score is warranted.
