6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Correctness (Answer)**: The LLM correctly answers "No" to compliance, matching the ground truth. (+2.0 points for core decision.)
- **Justification Structure and Completeness**: The LLM provides a rule-by-rule breakdown with reasoning, similar to the ground truth's tabular format in intent (though not in presentation). It references all rules and explains violations/satisfactions. (+1.5 points for structure, but -0.5 for overly verbose and speculative phrasing like "disrupting the required sequence" without direct rule citation.)
- **Rule 1 Assessment**: Major error. LLM incorrectly deems it violated, claiming QE and RA must be "directly" sequential without intervening activities (e.g., NA disrupts). Ground truth correctly states it's satisfied as long as QE precedes RA once each—no consecutiveness required in ruleset R. This misinterpretation is a significant factual inaccuracy, inverting the rule's intent. (-2.0 points for strictness on core rule error.)
- **Rule 2 Assessment**: Correctly satisfied (with timing after QE/RA for high severity), matching ground truth. Minor deduction for calling it "irrelevant due to prior violation," which assumes the erroneous Rule 1 violation. (+0.8 points.)
- **Rule 3 Assessment**: Correctly violated (NA before RA completion), directly matching ground truth reasoning. (+1.5 points.)
- **Rule 4 Assessment**: Correctly satisfied (after NA and VP), matching ground truth. (+1.0 point.)
- **Conclusion**: Correctly ties to non-compliance but erroneously cites "multiple violations (Rules 1 & 3)" instead of just Rule 3. This compounds the Rule 1 error. (-0.8 points.)
- **Strictness Adjustments**: Per instructions, the Rule 1 misclassification is not minor—it's a pivotal misreading of the ruleset, leading to overstated violations. No other small errors (e.g., trace details accurate), but this alone warrants substantial penalty. Total starts from 10.0 baseline, deducting for discrepancies.
