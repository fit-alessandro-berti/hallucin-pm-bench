The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamp and duration data, aligning with the ground truth's core reasoning in a single concise sentence. However, it loses points for minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; singular "timestamp" vs. plural "timestamps"; "data" vs. "information") and for omitting the ground truth's explicit mention of "only event counts" and the absence of "start-to-completion intervals," which provides a more complete explanation of the limitation.
