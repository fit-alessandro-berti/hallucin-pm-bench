6.5

The LLM answer matches the ground truth well for most rules but contains the following errors and issues:

**Positives:**
- R1, R2, R4, R5, R6: The verdicts are correct and justifications are broadly aligned, though less precise or slightly vague in places.
- The overall conclusion (“NON-COMPLIANT”) is correct.

**Errors and point deductions:**
- R3: The LLM incorrectly marks R3 as Compliant. In the trace, Pay_Invoice occurs before Receive_Goods, which is a violation. This is a direct contradiction to the ground truth and a significant error: -2.5 points.
- Justifications, particularly for R2, are not clear/precise enough (“Ship_Goods did not occur after the last required approval (triggered by R5)” is vague). The main issue was the >2 days violation after new approval, not just sequence: -0.5 points.
- R5’s justification is correct regarding sequence (“New Manager_Approval was not obtained before Ship_Goods”), but doesn't mention Pay_Invoice, which also occurred before the new approval (though it does note “before any further processing step,” so this is nearly acceptable): -0.25 points.
- The total wording is a little sloppier, and doesn't match full clarity or conciseness. However, the format and structure are mostly respected.

**Summary:**  
1. Major error on R3 (incorrect verdict): -2.5  
2. Minor lack of precision/coverage in justifications: -0.75  
3. Otherwise, the format, verdicts, and structure align well.

**Strict score: 6.5/10**
