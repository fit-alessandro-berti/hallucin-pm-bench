### Evaluation Breakdown
The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall **NON-COMPLIANT** status and properly formats the response with statuses and concise justifications (â‰¤20 words each) for all rules, adhering to the prompt's structure. It accurately assesses R1, R4, R5, and R6 with matching statuses and reasonable justifications. R2 is correctly marked as Violated, though the justification emphasizes the sequencing issue due to R5 rather than explicitly the >2-day timing post-final approval, which is a minor interpretive difference but still valid.

However, under strict evaluation, there is a critical error in R3: the status is incorrectly "Compliant" with a factual mistake in dates (claiming Pay_Invoice on March 7 after Receive_Goods on March 6, when the trace shows Pay_Invoice on 2025-03-06 before Receive_Goods on 2025-03-07). This violates R3 and should be "Violated," representing a major analytical and factual discrepancy that misses a key violation (one of three in ground truth). This alone warrants significant point deduction, as it shows incomplete or erroneous trace analysis. Minor differences in R5 justification (omits Pay_Invoice explicitly) add slight losses, but the primary issue dominates.

Overall, the answer is partially correct (catches 2/3 violations) but undermined by a high-impact error, justifying a mid-range score rather than higher.
