The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), using precise line numbers and case-IDs, and concisely disproving the "always follows" claim in one paragraph as required. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., bolding vs. italics, integrated "No." vs. standalone **No**, extra but accurate mention of Cancel_Order line 12) do not introduce errors or omissions under strict evaluation, as the substance, citations, and logical structure match perfectly.
