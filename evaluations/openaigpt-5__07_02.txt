### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies and summarizes all required changes under the exact specified headings, with correct content matching the ground truth (added tasks: three correct items; removed: one correct item; gateway: correct type change). No extraneous changes (e.g., name renamings) are included, adhering to instructions.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for strictness:
- **Formatting inconsistencies** (-0.3): Uses bullet points instead of numbered lists; presents ID before name (e.g., "Task_VerifyIdentity (Verify Identity)") vs. ground truth's name-first with backticks (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)`); lacks bolding and italics.
- **Gateway wording** (-0.5): Concise "Exclusive â†’ Inclusive" matches prompt example but omits ground truth's elaboration on "(XOR)" / "(OR)" semantics, version references (*v1*/*v2*), and confirmatory note "(No other...present)", reducing completeness under utmost strictness.
