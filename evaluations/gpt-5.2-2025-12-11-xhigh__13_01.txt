10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match in content, accuracy, and adherence to the ground truth across all questions. Question 1: Precise count of "1". Question 2: Correct calculation and rounding to "5.56%". Question 3: Correctly identifies sole case "A1002" (equivalent to "Only case A1002"). Question 4: Provides two clearly stated, valid sampling-related reasons matching ground truth options ("Temporal bias" via short time coverage; "Small sample size" via few cases/non-representative sample). No hallucinations, inferences, or deviations; formatting enhances clarity without altering facts.
