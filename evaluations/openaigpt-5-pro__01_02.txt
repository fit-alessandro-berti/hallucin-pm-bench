7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
To maintain strictness as instructed, I assessed the LLM answer against the ground truth by focusing on fidelity to the prompt: summarizing **only the decision points** (i.e., branching/approval gates in the process flow, using exact terminology) and listing **every required document** without introducing extraneous details or standard loan terms. The ground truth defines decision points narrowly as the three true branching steps (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and MBA), excluding linear verifications/checks like KYC or NFC. Minor wording variances in documents were penalized as "small errors" with point deductions, as they deviate from exact phrasing. The absence of the ground truth's clarifying note on non-standard documents also impacts completeness.

#### Decision Points (Major Section: 4/10 weight)
- **Strengths** (partial credit): Correctly identifies and describes Underwriter Alignment Gate (including scores, threshold, and escalation—though it redundantly prepends underwriter assignments, which ground truth attributes to the prior "Dual Underwriter Split"). Accurately captures Amount Threshold Decision logic and MBA as a voting decision.
- **Errors/Differences** (significant deductions):
  - Includes **Quick KYC Verification** as a "decision point," which it is not—it's a linear verification step (step 2) with no branching. Ground truth omits it entirely, as it doesn't involve decisions.
  - Includes **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** as a "decision point" with collection requirement, but it's a non-branching step (step 6); ground truth positions it only as a prerequisite before Amount Threshold, without listing it as a decision.
  - Misplaces context: Amount Threshold is described without explicitly noting it follows NFC (ground truth specifies "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), altering flow accuracy.
  - Expands MBA description slightly ("board votes approve or reject" vs. ground truth's "**Approve** or **Reject**" emphasis), but this is minor.
- **Overall**: LLM inflates the list with 5 items instead of 3, introducing irrelevant steps as "decisions." This violates the prompt's focus on branching points and exact terminology/flow, warranting ~40% deduction from a perfect score for this section.

#### Required Documents (Minor Section: 3/10 weight)
- **Strengths**: Lists all 6 exact documents matching ground truth (no omissions or additions). Uses precise names like "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet" and "Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)."
- **Errors/Differences** (moderate deductions):
  - Wording variances: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)" (extra "old" is unnecessary); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" ("Latest" and "single" are extras, implying unneeded specificity); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (extra "template" not in ground truth or process description).
  - Omits the ground truth's parenthetical note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which reinforces the prompt's emphasis on non-standard process (no credit checks). This reduces completeness.
- **Overall**: Near-identical list, but phrasing deviations and missing note deduct ~20-25%, as even small textual mismatches count as errors under strict criteria.

#### Overall Structure and Adherence (Minor Section: 3/10 weight)
- **Strengths**: Uses exact activity names (e.g., no "standard loan terminology" introduced). Bullet/list format is clear and prompt-compliant.
- **Errors**: No headings/sub-numbering matching ground truth's structured "#### Decision points" and "#### Required documents" with numbered lists. Lacks emphasis (e.g., bolding in ground truth). This is a minor formatting deviation but contributes to loss.

**Total Score Rationale**: The LLM answer is substantially correct on core content (80% alignment) but undermined by expanding decision points beyond the ground truth's scope—a critical misinterpretation of "decision points" as any step with checks, rather than branches. Documents are strong but not verbatim. Strict penalties for these yield 7.5 (solid but flawed; not 10 for perfection, not below 7 for major structural accuracy).
