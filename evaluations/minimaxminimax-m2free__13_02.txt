The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in values and calculations. For question 3, the response (85 words) adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, explicitly mentions the single occurrence (1 of 12 cases), notes variance/instability (e.g., skewing metrics like averages, overfitting leading to poor model performance), and cautions against over-generalization (misleading analyses when extrapolating to broader data), fulfilling all required elements without deviation or invention.
