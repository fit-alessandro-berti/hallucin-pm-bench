The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all factual content, sequence, and ordering with no additions, omissions, or errors. Minor formatting variations (e.g., absence of bullet points in Q3) do not constitute factual discrepancies under the evaluation criteria, as the prompt specifies only "one per line, alphabetically ordered" without mandating bullets.
