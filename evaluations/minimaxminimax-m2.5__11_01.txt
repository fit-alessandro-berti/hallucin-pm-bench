**8.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, numbers)**: Perfect match (10/10). Top 3 by avg waiting time correct (#1 Request_Documents 36.5/120.0, #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0, #3 Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4 h). Quotes verbatim from table.
- **No unwarranted content**: Mostly compliant (8/10). No other activities, no service-time/throughput figures. Minor violation: closing mentions "service durations" (forbidden "service-time" discussion) and "cycle speed" (throughput-adjacent). Strict deduction for explicit rule break.
- **Actions**: Relevant, concrete, data-driven (pilots/historical data), each promises ≥20% wait-time cut, tied to waiting (9/10). Logical, but **major differences from ground truth** (different specifics: self-service portal vs reminders; auto-gen e-mail vs e-signature; risk-score vs rules-engine). Strict loss for non-matching recommendations.
- **Format & constraints**: Excellent memo structure (header, subject, crisp ≤150 words ~110; bullets) vs ground truth's raw bullets/note (10/10). Fulfills "executive memo" better.
- **Overall**: High quality, fully functional response. Deductions only for rule violation (-0.5), action mismatches (-1.0). Utmost strictness applied to differences/violation.
