The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel; Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel), matching the ground truth content verbatim. No extraneous commentary or unchanged elements are included, adhering to the prompt's restrictions. However, formatting deviations deduct points: headings include unnecessary leading dashes ("- ADDED TASKS" instead of plain "ADDED TASKS"); items lack the bullet points ("- ") used in the ground truth for each entry under headings; and the second gateway line omits minor alignment spaces present in the ground truth. These are small but consistent errors across the output structure, warranting a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria despite perfect factual accuracy.
