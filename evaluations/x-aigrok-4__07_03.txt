The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes and lists all the right tasks and gateway type changes. However, it does not strictly adhere to the format required by the prompt and the ground truth:

- The headings are formatted incorrectly (bullet points with dashes and a space, instead of uppercase without a bullet).
- The items under each heading are missing the required leading hyphens and indentation, and parenthesis placement is correct but inconsistent with how the ground truth structures items (e.g., no hyphen).
- For gateways, the LLM omits space alignment/formatting (but the substantive change is correct).

These may appear minor, but the prompt specifically says to group under the three headings "verbatim and in this order" and underscores the need for strictness, so not matching the headings and bulleting precisely is penalized heavily. 

All verifiable differences are captured, and no extra commentary or incorrect entries are present, so major factual accuracy is preserved, but the formatting/structural errors result in a significant deduction as required.
