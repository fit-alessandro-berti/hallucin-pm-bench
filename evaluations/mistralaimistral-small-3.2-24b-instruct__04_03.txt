The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately pinpoints the core issue (NA occurring before RA completes, violating Rule 3), with Rule 2 and 4 correctly assessed as satisfied. However, it introduces significant errors by incorrectly labeling Rule 1 as violated (twice: in the point 1 header and final summary), despite explicitly acknowledging within point 1 that QE precedes RA as required. This misattribution confuses the ruleset and contradicts the ground truth's clear satisfaction of Rule 1, warranting a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria. The format (numbered list vs. table) is minor but adds to the divergence.
