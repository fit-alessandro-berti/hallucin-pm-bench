8.2

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Core correctness (high marks: 10/10)**: LLM correctly adds an interrupting boundary timer event (cancelActivity="true") on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H` duration, connecting via sequence flow to the existing unused `Activity_AMReview`, perfectly reusing elements without new activities. This enforces the SLA from ~end of Verify Identity. Justification is accurate, one sentence, and highlights reuse/escalation.
- **XML differences (deduct 0.8 total)**: 
  - Unnecessary `id="TimerEventDefinition_01"` on `<bpmn:timerEventDefinition>` (not in ground truth or original style; small error, -0.3).
  - Different `id`/`name` attributes (e.g., "Timer_SLA_48h"/"48-hour limit" vs. "Boundary_LateCreate"/"48h breach"; cosmetic but strict deduct, -0.3).
  - Sequence flow `id="Flow_Escalation"` vs. "Flow_LateEscalation" (-0.2).
- **Format/Instruction adherence (deduct 1.0)**: Violates "return **only** the changed or added XML elements" with extra header ("### Suggested XML Improvement"), bold prose description before XML, and "**Justification:**" label (ground truth integrates minimally with inline comments and italicized label; significant format deviation under strictness). No repetition of model, good.
- **Justification (minor deduct 0.0)**: Semantically equivalent, emphasizes existing task/escalation/SLA enforcement, though wordier/interpretive ("recovery path, manual intervention") vs. ground truth's literal phrasing.
- **Overall**: Excellent functional match (would be 10 without strict format/XML nitpicks), but strict policy on differences/extra content yields 8.2.
