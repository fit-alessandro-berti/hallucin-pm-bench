9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all three concurrent task sets from Process B with exact task names and ordering, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it includes an unrequested title/header, which introduces unnecessary extra content not specified in the prompt (which calls for only "numbered lines" of tasks separated by commas). Spacing after commas is consistent and matches (single space), and no prohibited tasks or processes are mentioned. Under strict evaluation, this minor addition deducts 1.0 point for deviation from the exact requested format.
