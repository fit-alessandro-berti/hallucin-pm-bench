The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in correctness, structure (numbered response with case-by-case justification citing sequences and CaseIDs), and conclusion. It accurately identifies the same compliant (C001, C003) and violating (C002, C004) cases with precise intervening activities, directly addressing the "always" claim. Minor stylistic differences (bullets vs. table; phrasing of conclusion) do not introduce errors or omissions, warranting no deduction under strict evaluation.
