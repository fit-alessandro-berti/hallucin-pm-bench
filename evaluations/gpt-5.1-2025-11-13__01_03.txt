### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two core decision points but fabricates an extraneous third one ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome") that misrepresents the process description by treating the risk check itself as a decision gate rather than an input to the actual conditional branch in step 4. This introduces a hallucinated element, diverging meaningfully from the ground truth's precise count and focus (exactly two points, without describing the check as a decision). Phrasing in the TriVote rule is mostly accurate but adds "fails otherwise," which is implied but not in the ground truth's concise wording. Strict deduction for the extra/inaccurate point: -3.0 points.
- **Part (b)**: The list is mostly accurate in order and content but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document (per step 8's explicit mention), collapsing it into the unsigned version's entry, resulting in only 8 items instead of 9. Additionally, the LLM includes unrequested descriptive annotations (e.g., step references and usage details), bloating the format beyond a simple ordered list. No hallucinations of absent elements like KYC, but the missing item and formatting deviations are clear errors. Strict deduction for incompleteness and extraneous content: -2.0 points.
- **Overall**: Strong alignment on core facts (e.g., rules, document sequence) but undermined by invention in (a) and omission/formatting issues in (b), warranting a middling score under utmost strictness. No partial credit for near-misses.
