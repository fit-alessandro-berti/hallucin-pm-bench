**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: Both correctly state "1"/"once" based on data (case 1002 only). No deduction.
- **Q2 (strong but notable differences, -1.8 total)**:
  | Aspect | LLM Answer | Ground Truth | Issue |
  |--------|------------|--------------|-------|
  | Sample size | 3 cases, 14 events, 1 day (early-day) | 14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours | Minor: LLM omits exact time span (-0.2); both quantify well. |
  | Sampling bias | Tiny/time-limited/sparse → under/overestimate | Single event swings 0%-7%; wide CI; extreme error for **rare events** | Significant: Misses quantification (0-7%), CI, "rare events" emphasis (-0.8). |
  | Label issues | Varies (examples given); different labels distort | Near-synonyms; **strict excludes/fuzzy over-includes** | Close but vaguer; misses strict/fuzzy distinction (-0.5). |
  | Solution hint | Implied (full month) | Explicit: larger/random slice or full log | Minor omission (-0.1). |
  | Other | ≤120 words (~95); restates count w/ case | ≤120 words (~110); restates w/ case/time | Equivalent. |
  | Strictness penalty | Generalizes volatility/label risks | Precise, analytical (volatility math, rarity) | -0.2 for less depth. |

Overall: Accurate/no speculation, covers cores (small N, labels), but lacks ground truth's precision/insights → strict deduction.
