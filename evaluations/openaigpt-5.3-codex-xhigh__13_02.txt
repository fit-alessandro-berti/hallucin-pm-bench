**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth under utmost strictness:

- **Q1**: Exact match (**1**), with accurate case reference (C05; from data).
- **Q2a/b**: Exact calculations and formatting (**2.08%**, **8.33%**), with correct formulas shown.
- **Q3**: ≤100 words (87 words); fully satisfies criteria—(i) single occurrence/low support ("only one case", "rare path", "low-support"), (ii) variance/instability ("statistically fragile", "distorted", "overfit noise"), (iii) over-generalisation caution ("incorrectly suggest a strong rule", "unreliable process dynamics"). Adds data-specific insight (followed by approval in C05) without invention.

No errors, deviations, or inventions; fully data-bound.
