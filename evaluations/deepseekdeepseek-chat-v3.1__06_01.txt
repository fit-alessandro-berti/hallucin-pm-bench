9.0

The LLM answer gives the correct pairs according to the process description and in the required format. However, there are minor errors in formatting:

1. The LLM answer uses bold formatting for the task pairs, while the specified output format only requests plain text with two spaces before and after the em dash (—). The LLM answer does not consistently follow this exact spacing: it uses a single space before and after the em dash, instead of two as given by the ground truth (compare `"Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines"` vs `"Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"`).  
2. The answer omits the plain text and line break formatting (backticks) seen in the ground truth, though this may be a matter of context and not as strict as the use of spaces and dashes.

Substantively, the answer is completely correct: it lists only the pairs that can be performed in parallel, in the proper (alphabetical) order. Because there is a formatting requirement, even small deviations should deduct a full point. The answer demonstrates correct understanding of task logic and the strict alphabetical ordering required.

Thus, 9.0 is appropriate: full credit for substance, with a 1-point penalty for not strictly obeying the specified output format.
