**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect, correctly identifies "No" with precise counterexamples (C002, C004 sequences), explicitly notes compliant cases (C001, C003), and cites relevant CaseIDs/sequences as required. No errors, omissions, or inaccuracies vs. ground truth; stylistic differences (concise text vs. table) do not impact correctness or completeness under the task criteria.
