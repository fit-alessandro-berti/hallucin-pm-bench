2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Positive, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses only the authorized terms ("Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks. No disallowed phrasings appear.
- **Table Structure (-3.0 points)**: Major mismatch. The LLM uses R/A/C/I columns (a valid but non-matching format), while the ground truth uses role-based columns. This deviates from the exact presentation in the ground truth, violating strict matching criteria.
- **Activities Covered (-3.5 points)**: Significant errors. The LLM adds unauthorized activities ("Schedule Payment," "Notify Originating Analyst"), explicitly forbidden by the prompt ("do not... add activities"). It omits or merges implied steps (e.g., no separate "Compliance Officer Approval" alignment with narrative escalation). Ground truth has exactly 6 activities; LLM has 8, introducing extras not precisely matching.
- **RACI Assignments (-3.0 points)**: Extensive inaccuracies across all shared activities, even small ones costing points per strictness rule. Examples:
  - Intake Vetting: Misses "C" (Compliance Analyst) and "I" (Treasury Ops).
  - KYC Review/AML Screening: Misses "C" (Compliance Officer) and "I" (Treasury Ops).
  - Risk Scoring: Incorrect (LLM: R/A Compliance Analyst; GT: C Front-Office, R Compliance Analyst, A Compliance Officer, I Treasury Ops)—alters responsibility and adds unmentioned "C."
  - Compliance Officer Approval: Misses "I" (Front-Office Analyst) and "C" (Compliance Analyst); misplaces "I" to Compliance Analyst only.
  - Release Funds: Misses "I" (Front-Office Analyst) and "C" (Compliance Officer); incorrect "I" only to Compliance Analyst.
  - Extra activities have no ground truth equivalents, amplifying errors.
- **Overall Coverage of Roles and Process (-1.0 points)**: Fails to cover "every activity and role" accurately per narrative translation to authorized terms. Roles like Compliance Officer are underrepresented (e.g., no "C" involvements). No merging/renaming, but additions undermine completeness.
- **Formatting and Adherence (-0.5 points)**: Markdown table is clean, but lacks ground truth's "**R, A**" bolding, dashes (–), and key notes. No extraneous text, but strict match requires identical presentation.

Total reflects utmost strictness: Correct vocabulary saves it from 1.0, but structural/content deviations and additions result in substantial deductions.
