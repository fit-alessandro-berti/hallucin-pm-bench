6.0

The LLM answer makes an earnest attempt to adhere to the required vocabulary policy, and there are strengths, such as using "Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," and "Risk Scoring" exclusively, without leaking synonyms. However, applying strict grading criteria reveals major issues:

**Significant issues:**

1. **Table Structure:**  
   - The LLM responded with a table using column headers "Activity | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed" (the common "vertical" RACI format).  
   - The ground truth required *roles as columns* and *activities as rows*, with R/A/C/I designations in each cell.  
   - This mismatch in structure is a substantial deviation.

2. **Missing ‘R, A’ Notation:**  
   - The ground truth requires showing **R, A** when roles are both Responsible and Accountable for an activity. In the LLM answer, "Responsible" and "Accountable" are simply duplicated in many rows, rather than using "R, A" in cells. 
   - The ground truth also uses dashes ("–") for no involvement; this is missing from the LLM answer.

3. **Incorrect Role Assignments:**  
   - For "Risk Scoring," the ground truth makes "Compliance Analyst" Consulted (C) and "Compliance Officer" Accountable (A), but the LLM has Compliance Analyst responsible and accountable and omits officer involvement.
   - For "Release Funds", the LLM notes Treasury Ops as both Responsible and Accountable, but omits all other parties, whereas ground truth properly marks the Compliance Analyst and Officer as Consulted and Informed as appropriate.
   - “Schedule Payment” is not an activity in the ground truth and should not appear—incorrect activity inclusion.

4. **Redundant and Extra Activities:**  
   - The LLM invents some activities (e.g., "Schedule Payment," "Notify Originating Analyst") that do not exist in the ground truth; these should not be included.

5. **Omission of Key Participants:**  
   - Informed and Consulted roles for several activities are missing or misplaced.

**Minor issues:**

6. **Formatting:**  
   - The required formatting for the RACI matrix is not met, specifically in the assignment of dual roles (R, A) and dashes. Also, role roster order is not preserved.

**Summary:**  
Score starts high due to proper vocabulary adherence and not leaking synonyms, but major marks are deducted for structural nonconformance, activity misalignment, omission/invention of activities, role assignment errors, and notation/form issues.  

**A perfect answer would have had:**  
- All six activities from ground truth, nothing extra or missing.
- The correct tabular structure.
- The mandated "R, A" and "–"/dash conventions.
- All activities and roles mapped as in ground truth.
- No extra explanations or synonyms.

**Overall:** Significant errors merit a 4-point deduction—but full vocabulary compliance and partial mapping accuracy justify not going below 6.0.
