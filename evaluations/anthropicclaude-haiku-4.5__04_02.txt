The LLM answer correctly identifies all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) matching the ground truth exactly, including the overall NON-COMPLIANT result with the same violating rules (R2, R3, R5). Justifications convey accurate reasoning aligned with the ground truth, capturing key events, dates, and rule linkages (e.g., impact of Change_Request on approvals and timing for R2/R5). However, under strict evaluation:

- Justifications for R2 (~45 words) and R5 (~30 words) significantly exceed the â‰¤20-word limit, violating the specified format (deduct 1.0 point each).
- Overall structure uses elaborate report formatting (headings, bullets, extra summary text) not required by the prompt, deviating from the concise per-rule format (deduct 0.5 point).
- Minor phrasing in R2 initially notes initial compliance window before pivoting to violation, slightly less direct than ground truth (negligible deduction, but strictness noted).

No factual errors in compliance analysis, but format adherence is imperfect, preventing a perfect score.
