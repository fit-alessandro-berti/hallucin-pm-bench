Rationale: The LLM answer follows the format and provides mostly correct responses, but commits significant factual and interpretative mistakes:

- R1: The LLM says compliant but gives an incomplete justification (does not note the approval order or that approvals must follow each other).
- R2: It checks only the time from Finance_Approval to Ship_Goods (1 day, incorrectly called 3), but with the Change_Request after approvals, the clock resetsâ€”Ship_Goods must occur within 2 days of the new Manager_Approval (which occurs after Ship_Goods). The LLM thus gives the wrong reason for violation (should have referenced the need for a NEW approval after the Change_Request).
- R3: Correctly flagged as violated with correct supporting dates.
- R4: Correct and matches ground truth.
- R5: Correct decision (violated), but justification lacks specificity: while it notes "no new approval before Ship_Goods," it should have also mentioned Pay_Invoice as a violation.
- R6: Correct.
- Overall result: Correct.

Major deductions for incorrectly justifying R2, partial justification for R5, minor issues in format and insufficient details for R1. These reflect more than minor errors, but there is still evident understanding and partial accuracy versus complete failure.
