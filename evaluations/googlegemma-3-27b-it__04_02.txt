7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all rule statuses and the overall NON-COMPLIANT result, matching the ground truth. Justifications are concise (all â‰¤20 words) and mostly accurate, but deduct points for: R1 omission of "followed by" sequence (minor, -0.5); R2 factual error in day count (1 day, not 3) and missing key detail on post-change approval as "last required" (major inaccuracy, -2.0); R5 imprecise (omits multiple pre-approval steps like Pay_Invoice, minor, -0.5). Format adheres to prompt but lacks ground truth's table structure (negligible deduction).
