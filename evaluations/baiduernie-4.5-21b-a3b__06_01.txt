2.0

- The LLM answer did correctly list `Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check` as a valid parallel pair.
- However, it **missed** the pair `Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`, which is clearly stated as being able to "start immediately... and may run simultaneously.” This is a major omission.
- The LLM incorrectly included `Package  —  Create_Documentation` and `Package  —  Quality_Check`. According to the description, `Package` can *only* start after both `Quality_Check` and `Create_Documentation` are complete; there is **no overlap** here, so these pairs are simply incorrect.
- The answer added explanatory notes and context, which were unnecessary and not in the requested format. However, as the instructions just say "output one pair per line", extra commentary is not punished as harshly as factual or formatting mistakes.
- The LLM mostly adhered to the "alphabetical order within pair and overall list," though its inclusion of two invalid pairs somewhat negated this.
- The critical errors are (a) omitting an entire valid pair, and (b) adding two entirely invalid pairs, which both count as major factual faults.

Thus, the answer is mostly incorrect, but as it at least included one correct pair in the correct format, it avoids a 1.0.
