4.0

The LLM's RACI matrix exhibits multiple significant errors when compared to the ground truth:

- **Vocab Policy:** The LLM strictly adheres to using only the authorized terms (e.g., "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", etc.), which is correct.
- **Activities Mismatch:** The LLM outputs several unapproved activity names, such as "Approval", "Scheduling Payment", "Notification", and does not, for example, include "Compliance Officer Approval" or "Release Funds" with the exact titles specified.
- **Responsibilities Incorrect:** The RACI assignments are off:
    - Fails to designate dual "R, A" where required (e.g., "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Release Funds").
    - "Compliance Officer Approval" is missing as a distinct row and its responsible/accountable mapping is not present.
    - For "Risk Scoring", incorrectly assigns "Responsible" to Compliance Analyst and "Informed" to Treasury Ops, instead of making Compliance Officer "Accountable" and Front-Office Analyst "Consulted".
    - Consulted (C) and Informed (I) stakeholders are under-assigned; each row in the ground truth has clear I and C assignments, often omitted or misplaced here.
- **Extra Activities:** "Scheduling Payment" and "Notification" are activities not in the authorized list and should not have been included.
- **Formatting:** For RACI letters, ground truth uses "R, A" to show both roles; the LLM uses only one letter per cell and misses combined roles.

Given these discrepancies—wrong and missing activities, incorrect RACI assignments, missing “Compliance Officer Approval”, improper use of "R, A" vs. separate roles, and the inclusion of unauthorized activities—the answer deviates markedly from the ground truth, despite adherence to vocabulary policy. It merits a low score, but not 1.0 because there are traces of correct vocabulary and some correct pairings on the most basic activities.
