4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Strong, +2.0 points)**: The LLM correctly uses only the four authorized terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no synonyms, leaks, or alternatives from the narrative. This matches the ground truth and policy perfectly.
- **Activity Coverage and Structure (Weak, -3.0 points)**: The prompt requires covering *every activity* from the narrative without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM identifies the core four correctly but adds two extraneous activities ("Scheduling Payment", "Notification") not distinctly separable in the narrative and renames/splits others imprecisely (e.g., "Approval" is too vague vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Releasing Funds" matches but is bundled in ground truth's "Release Funds"). This violates "do not add" and leads to 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6, inflating the scope incorrectly.
- **RACI Assignments (Poor, -2.5 points)**: Assignments differ significantly across nearly all cells, with frequent omissions of key roles (e.g., no "Consulted" entries anywhere, despite ground truth having multiple "C"s like Compliance Analyst for Intake Vetting; missing "Accountable" for several, such as Compliance Analyst as "A" for KYC Review and AML Screening). Escalation logic (e.g., Officer as "A" for Risk Scoring) is mishandled, and involvement like "I" for Front-Office Analyst in Approval is absent. Even small mismatches (e.g., Front-Office as only "R" vs. "R,A" for Intake Vetting) compound under strictness.
- **Format and Extras (Moderate, -1.0 point)**: Markdown table is present and readable, but uses verbose labels ("Responsible") instead of compact abbreviations ("R"), lacks bolding on activities/main assignments, and includes an unrequested "Notes" section. Dashes (â€“) for no involvement are inconsistently handled (ground truth uses them explicitly). No merging occurs, but overall polish is off.
- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt and Ground Truth (Low)**: The output captures the intent partially but deviates too much in structure and accuracy, making it unreliable as a governance tool. Under utmost strictness, even minor assignment errors (e.g., missing "C" roles) deduct heavily, pulling the score down from a potential 7.0 (for vocab alone) to 4.5.
