8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h 95th; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quoting metrics verbatim from the table. It stays under 150 words (~110), omits service times/throughput/other activities, and provides one concrete action per activity tied to waiting-time issues, each implying â‰¥20% reduction.

Minor deductions for:
- **Action specificity/data-driven claim**: Actions are logical and relevant (e.g., automation for documents, batching for letters, triage for assessments) but lack explicit data backing (e.g., no "pilot tests" or "estimated 30%" as in ground truth), weakening the "data-driven" requirement slightly (-1.0).
- **Format differences**: Full memo header is appropriate for an "executive memo" but diverges from ground truth's concise list style (-0.5).

Core correctness is strong per scoring notes, but strict evaluation penalizes these variances.
