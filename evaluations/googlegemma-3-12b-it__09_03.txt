The LLM answer correctly states that it cannot compute the requested metrics and provides a clear, precise reason, specifically referencing the absence of event log data and timestamps needed for calculation. However, compared to the ground truth, it is slightly less specific in mentioning the need for "concrete times for any 'Approve Invoice' execution" and does not explicitly state that "additional raw log entries are required." The emphasis in the ground truth on the impossibility due to lacking both event rows and concrete times is slightly stronger. This small lack of detail results in a slight deduction in score.
