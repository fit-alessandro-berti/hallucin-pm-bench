6.0

**Reasoning:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer follows the vocabulary mandate: "Transaction Analyst," "Regulatory Liaison," and "KYC Review" were used properly and exclusively.
- The general structure and format aligns with a proper RACI matrix.

**Major Issues and Point Deductions:**

1. **Omission of "Operations Manager" role (−2 points):**
   - The ground truth has an "Operations Manager" as **Accountable** for every step, which is correct since RACI usually has clear accountability per task. The LLM omitted this role entirely, losing significant process-control clarity.

2. **Activity phrasing discrepancies (−0.5 point):**
   - Some activity/task names (e.g., "Receive & Log Transfer instruction") are less precise than the ground truth's ("Receive Payment Instruction").
   - The LLM sometimes merges or splits tasks differently than the ground truth. E.g., "SWIFT Transmission" is not in ground truth, and "Archive case file & notify Regulatory Liaison" merges two actions, causing misalignment.

3. **Responsibility/Accountability assignment errors (−1 point):**
   - Multiple tasks have "R/A" for one role, whereas the ground truth carefully distinguishes "Responsible" and "Accountable" by using two roles per row.
   - In RACI, "Accountable" should only be one per task, but "R/A" for the same person is not the same as having them split across two individuals. This muddles responsibility.
   - E.g., IT Support is "R/A" for archiving, but there’s no explicit "Accountable" Operations Manager as in the ground truth.

4. **Missing tasks and notification details (−0.5 point):**
   - "Archive Record" is not explicitly labeled as such; "notify Regulatory Liaison" is clumped with archiving, while the ground truth separates roles and tasks.

5. **Consulted/Informed inconsistencies (−0.5 point):**
   - The ground truth distinguishes when IT Support is "Consulted" versus "Informed," but the LLM sometimes uses "I" where "C" is appropriate and vice versa.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer gets the enforced vocabulary almost perfect and maintains a generally correct RACI structure. However, significant RACI methodology flaws (missing Accountable role, improper assignments, and merging/splitting of tasks) constitute severe process-management documentation errors. These cause a substantial reduction from a perfect score.

**Final Score:** 6.0
