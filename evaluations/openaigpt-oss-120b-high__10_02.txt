2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and fidelity to the prompt's requirements, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Roles**: The LLM uses only three roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting the "Operations Manager" column present in the ground truth. This is a major structural mismatch, as the ground truth explicitly includes it, altering the entire RACI framework.
  
- **Tasks/Activities**: 
  - The LLM expands to 7 tasks, introducing an unmentioned split (e.g., "SWIFT Transmission" as a separate task #6 and "Archive case file & notify Regulatory Liaison" as #7), while the ground truth sticks to 6 tasks directly mapping the source text without additions or splits.
  - Wording differences are inconsistent and non-exact: e.g., LLM's "Receive & Log Transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Sanctions Screening" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "High‑Risk Approval" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions"; "Release Payment" (partial match); "Archive case file & notify" vs. "Archive Record" (which omits explicit notification but aligns more closely to source step 6). The LLM adds details like "(sender & beneficiary)" to KYC Review, which is extraneous.
  - Not all tasks use mandated wording precisely; e.g., the ground truth headers emphasize "(mandated wording)" and bold **KYC Review** consistently, while the LLM integrates it but adds non-mandated phrasings.

- **RACI Assignments**: Assignments differ substantially across nearly all tasks, with no direct alignment:
  - Task 1: LLM (TA: R/A, others I) vs. ground truth (TA: R, OM: A, RL: I, IT: C).
  - Task 2: LLM (TA: R/A, RL: C, IT: I) vs. ground truth (TA: R, RL: A, OM: I, IT: C).
  - Task 3: Partial overlap (RL as R/A in LLM vs. R in ground truth; TA as C in both), but IT differs (I in both? Wait, LLM I, ground I—minor match), and missing OM: A.
  - Task 4: Similar partial overlap but differences in IT (I in both) and missing OM.
  - Task 5: LLM (TA: R/A, RL: C, IT: I) vs. ground truth (TA: R, OM: A, RL: I, IT: C)—reversed emphases.
  - LLM's extra tasks (#6-7) have no ground truth equivalents, leading to complete divergence.
  - The LLM combines R/A in single cells (e.g., **R / A**), while the ground truth separates them into per-role columns, violating format consistency.

- **Formatting and Additional Elements**:
  - Markdown table structure differs: LLM uses fewer columns and combined R/A notations; ground truth has explicit separation and a more precise header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)").
  - The LLM adds a title ("RACI Matrix – AtlasRemit Cross‑Border Payment Process") and a "Key" section, which the ground truth lacks (it uses a simple "Legend"). The LLM's end note claims adherence to vocabulary, but this is unnecessary and not in the ground truth.
  - Bolded elements (e.g., **KYC Review**) are used in both, but the LLM over-applies them (e.g., in cells).

- **Overall Adherence to Prompt**:
  - Both use mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") correctly where applicable, and neither introduces forbidden terms like "Customer Due Diligence". However, the LLM's extra task and role omissions show incomplete coverage of the source text as interpreted by the ground truth.
  - Small errors compound: e.g., the LLM's inclusion of notification in task 7 alters the source step 6 slightly; inconsistent task numbering/phrasing reflects poor mapping.

These cumulative differences—structural (roles/tasks), content (assignments/wording), and format—indicate the LLM answer poorly replicates the ground truth, justifying a score of 2.5. It covers the basics (vocabulary, Markdown table) but fails in precision and completeness relative to the benchmark.
