8.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (basis for not lower score)**: Correctly identifies **all** required changes without omissions or hallucinations. Added tasks: exactly the 3 correct ones (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject). Removed: exactly 1 correct (Reject Loan). Gateway: precisely exclusive → inclusive, with accurate BPMN tags.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Extra interpretive text**: Phrases like "(replacing the previous reject task functionality)" and "in favor of the new rejection task structure" incorrectly imply *replacement* semantics, blurring distinct "Added" vs. "Removed" categories (0.5 deduction). Position descriptions ("initial step", "new path") are unnecessary details, violating "strictly under headings".
  - **Verbose explanations**: Gateway section adds unrequested analysis ("enables... multiple concurrent outcomes (e.g., approving while also requesting documents)"), deviating from concise summary (0.5 deduction).
  - **Unnecessary intro**: Opening sentence ("As a process-mining analyst...") echoes system role but not in ground truth or prompt requirements (0.3 deduction).
  - **Formatting/style diffs**: Bullets vs. numbered lists; bolding similar but not identical phrasing (e.g., full "Exclusive Gateway" vs. "exclusive (XOR)"; no *v1*/*v2* refs) (0.4 deduction). No closing note "(No other... present)".
  - **Minor phrasing**: "Final Reject" vs. ground truth's consistent "**Final Reject**"; overall less concise.

Total: Perfect 10.0 minus 1.7 for cumulative small-but-significant deviations = 8.3, rounded down to 8.0 for utmost strictness on non-exact match.
