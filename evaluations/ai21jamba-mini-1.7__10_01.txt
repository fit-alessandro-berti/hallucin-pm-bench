2.5

- The answer fails to use two of the three required terms: “KYC Review” and “Payment Clearance” do not appear; instead, legacy or incorrect terms (“Order Vetting” is only partially correct, and "Advanced" and "Payment Clearance" are misapplied; "KYC Review" is *never* mentioned).
- The matrix structure is poorly formatted; some rows are inconsistent/missing (“Advanced“ appears out of context; activity rows don’t match the described steps).
- RACI assignments do not consistently align with the roles described in the process (e.g., multiple AC, FC, which do not conform to R/A/C/I notation and do not map to the real process roles).
- Legend is present, but “I” (Informed) is absent from the matrix itself and columns, reflecting mistakes in role assignment and omissions.
- The overall organization and strictness to instructions are lacking, though there was partial effort to map the activities to roles. Thus, a low score reflects the significant terminology breach and incorrect mappings, despite some recognition of the task setup.
