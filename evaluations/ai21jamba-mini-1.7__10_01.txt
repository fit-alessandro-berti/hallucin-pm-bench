1.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology (Critical Failure, -4.0 points)**: Mandated terms "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" must all appear exactly as specified. The response uses "Order Vetting" and "Payment Clearance" correctly but entirely omits "KYC Review" for the second activity (replacing it with no label or garbled content). No forbidden terms are used, but the incomplete adherence to the strict vocabulary policy results in total non-compliance for the full set.
  
- **RACI Allocations (Critical Failure, -3.0 points)**: Assignments do not reflect the process narrative. Examples:
  - No single "Responsible" per activity (e.g., "Receive Application" scatters R, A, C, AC without clear ownership; ground truth has AM as R/A).
  - "Order Vetting" has incomplete/wrong entries (C/AC, missing roles).
  - "Payment Clearance" incorrectly places "FC" under what seems to be a header (wrong role assignments; ground truth has FC as R, AM as A).
  - "Record Update" uses "AC" repeatedly (non-standard; ground truth has IT as R, others C/I).
  - "Notify Customer" incomplete (C/AC; ground truth has AM as R/A, others I).
  - Missing "I" entries where required (e.g., many activities should have I for FC/IT). Accountable roles for AM are not appropriately assigned.

- **Formatting and Completeness (Critical Failure, -2.0 points)**: Not a proper RACI matrix (rows for activities, columns for roles). Instead, it's a fragmented, unreadable list with misaligned entries (e.g., "Advanced" is nonsensical gibberish; activities lack full rows). No table structure as expected. Legend is present but irrelevant due to the matrix's invalidity. No extra tasks/roles introduced, but the output is unusable and incomplete (e.g., second activity unnamed, rows truncated).

Overall, the response fails on all core rubric criteria (correctness, no unwarranted content is moot due to errors). Even minor fixes couldn't salvage it under strict evaluationâ€”major deviations from ground truth warrant the minimum score.
