The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" as the response and provides a concise, accurate justification in one paragraph that cites the exact same counter-examples (C003 with lines 6 and 7, and C005 with Validate_Payment on line 11 lacking a prior Receive_Order) as the ground truth. It faithfully demonstrates why the claim is false by highlighting the sequence violation and absence. Minor deductions for slightly less formal structure (no bullets) and phrasing ("before" vs. "occurs first"; "without any prior" vs. "never contains at all"), but these are stylistic and do not affect factual accuracy or completeness.
