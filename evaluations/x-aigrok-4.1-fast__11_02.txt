**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Identical three activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment) correctly identified as worst based on table metrics (e.g., throughput drops, high wait/processing/rework/SLA). Explanations strictly table-derived (e.g., 150-min wait, 22% rework, 25-min processing, 12.4% SLA). Actions concrete and data-driven (quantified targets like "<30 min wait", "halve stdev to 4.5 min"). Memo format executive-style, 148 words <200 limit. No hallucinations, absent activities, or guesses.
- **Minor Deductions (-0.8 total, per strictness)**: 
  - Multipliers ("25x peers", "35x peers", "3x peers") interpretive/approximate (e.g., wait avg peers ~10 min → ~15x not 25x; rework avg ~1.3% → ~17x not 35x) – not "strictly" table absolutes like ground truth. (-0.4)
  - Actions/projections diverge (e.g., LLM: parallel requests, standardize checklist, add 2 FTEs, 15% gain; ground truth: digital validation/AI/triage, 10% gain) – valid but less matching emphasis on upstream flow/SLA totality. (-0.2)
  - Added summary/header details (e.g., "Date", 15% projection) enhance but slightly exceed ground truth's concise phrasing. (-0.2)
- Overall: Extremely close (core rubric met precisely), but strict policy penalizes approximations and stylistic variances as small errors.
