The LLM answer fails entirely: proposes multiple incorrect, vague suggestions (e.g., timers on `Task_Check`, `Task_RequestDocs`, `GW_Docs`, flow `f4`/`f6`; wrong durations like P1D/P2D ≠ PT48H; non-interrupting vs. interrupting; no bypass to `Task_Triage` from submission point). Ignores optimal placement on `Task_Receive`, lacks element ID "Timer_48h", no XML `timeDuration`, no direct escalation flow to `Task_Triage`. Exceeds 120 words, not plain English, doesn't ensure SLA from submission. Zero alignment with ground truth.
