3.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Overall Correctness (Answer)**: The LLM correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant ("No"), matching the ground truth. This earns partial credit (+1.0 base).
- **Justification Accuracy**:
  - Rule 1: Major error – LLM incorrectly claims violation due to NA interrupting the sequence, but the ground truth correctly assesses it as satisfied (QE precedes RA; no requirement for consecutiveness). This is a significant misinterpretation of the rule (-2.0).
  - Rule 2: Major error – LLM wrongly deems it violated via "cascade" from Rule 1, while ground truth confirms satisfaction (VP after both QE and RA). This compounds the Rule 1 mistake (-1.5).
  - Rule 3: Correctly identified as violated with accurate reasoning (NA before RA), fully matching ground truth (+1.0).
  - Rule 4: Correctly assessed as satisfied, matching ground truth (+0.5).
  - Summary/Structure: Mentions violations of Rules 1, 2, and 3, but inaccurately includes 1 and 2; ground truth only flags Rule 3. The added "criticality" note is redundant but not harmful (+0.5 for overall non-compliance conclusion).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, small errors incur significant loss; here, two core rule assessments are factually wrong, leading to overstated violations and flawed logic. No minor issues – these are substantive differences reducing fidelity to ground truth by ~50% in justification depth.
- **Total Calculation**: Base (1.0) + matches (3.0) - errors (3.5) = 3.5. The response is informative but undermined by key inaccuracies.
