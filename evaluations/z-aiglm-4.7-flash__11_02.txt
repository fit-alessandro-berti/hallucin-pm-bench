**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Criteria)
- **Identification of three worst activities (major failure, -3.0 pts):** Correctly flags **Request_Documents** and **Review_Documents** (top issues: wait/rework for first, processing/SLA for second). But third is catastrophically wrong—claims "ambiguity" in efficient end-stage activities (**Approve_Claim**, **Pay_Claim**, **Notify_Customer**) with best metrics (low wait/processing/rework/SLA). Ignores actual third-worst (**Initial_Assessment**: 18min wait, 12min processing, 3.2% SLA, 1.8% rework). Mischaracterizes low throughput (cumulative flow issue) as underperformance without upstream context.
- **Explanations (partial, -1.5 pts):** Accurate for top two (cites table metrics directly), but incomplete (misses **Review_Documents** 30min wait, 5.3% rework, 9min stdev). Third explanation invalid—low throughput not "under-performance" indicator here; hedges instead of picking data-driven third.
- **Recommendations (partial, -1.0 pt):** Concrete/data-linked for top two (batch for queues/rework; triage for processing). Zero for third (just "indistinguishable"—violates "one concrete... for each").
- **Format/Conciseness (minor deductions, -0.3 pt):** Under 200 words, memo-like title, but fragmented list ("two stages" contradicts three points); lacks ground truth polish/summary projection.
- **Strict adherence/Factual precision (+1.0 base):** No hallucinations outside table; honest ambiguity note (but misapplied). Still, core task unmet (only ~67% of required trio).

Total reflects ~60-70% alignment; strictness docks heavily for incomplete trio and wrong candidates.
