The LLM answer is functionally perfect, correctly identifying and listing all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel) in the exact required format (id (name) for tasks, id: old → new for gateways), with no extras, guesses, or commentary. Headings are verbatim and in order.

However, under utmost strictness, minor formatting differences deduct points:
- Extra space after each heading ("TASKS  ", "Review  ", "CHANGES  " vs. no extra space).
- Extra blank line (two newlines) after each heading before bullets (vs. single newline in ground truth).
- Second gateway line lacks alignment spaces after colon ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").

These small whitespace discrepancies (5 instances) warrant a 1.0-point deduction despite semantic identity.
