The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel sets and their tasks, matching the core content of the ground truth. However, it introduces unnecessary introductory phrasing ("Of course. Focusing only on..."), verbose explanations of execution timing and flow (e.g., "after 'Receive_Stock' and before..."), and differing formatting (bullets, italics, and references to "Parallel Split #1/#2" instead of "first/second parallel block" with â€– notation). These additions deviate from the prompt's strict instruction to simply "list each set" and inflate differences from the concise ground truth, warranting a deduction for lack of precision despite overall accuracy.
