6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the essential elements of the prompt (summarizing decision points and listing documents) without introducing undefined activities or artifacts, adhering to the "do not introduce" constraint. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs significant point deductions for deviations from the ground truth in structure, completeness, and fidelity:

- **Decision Points (major deductions: ~2.5 points lost)**:
  - Over-identifies decision points (4 vs. ground truth's 3), fragmenting the process into extraneous categories (e.g., treats **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** as a standalone "Decision Point B" with undefined negative outcomes, and invents "Decision Point D: Payment readiness" as a gating check, which the ground truth consolidates into a single "Final payment approval" at #3 combining pre-approve and auditor review). This introduces interpretive "decisions" (e.g., explicit system checks for prerequisites and BankTransferAuthorization presence) not summarized as distinct points in the ground truth, bloating the summary beyond a strict match.
  - Infers negative paths ("path not defined") more cautiously than ground truth's direct assumptions ("claim rejected/returned"; "process ends without payment"), but fails to align exactly with ground truth's branching logic phrasing and sequencing (e.g., amount threshold is correctly placed after pre-approve, but overall flow is less concise).
  - Verbose descriptions (e.g., "What happens" subsections, outcomes with undefined paths, notes on constraints) exceed the prompt's call for a summary, adding unrequested detail while diluting focus.

- **Required Documents (minor deductions: ~1.0 point lost)**:
  - List matches ground truth exactly (all 7 documents, no extras), including correct qualifiers for **AuditTrail** (LLM notes "if applicable"; ground truth specifies "only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue").
  - However, embeds document mentions redundantly within decision points (e.g., repeated **RefundRequestForm** references), which scatters the consolidated list and introduces minor interpretive phrasing (e.g., "Implicit) Senior_Auditor_Review documentation itself"), not present in ground truth's clean, numbered format.

- **Overall Fidelity and Style (minor deductions: ~0.5 points lost)**:
  - No hallucinations of activities/artifacts (correctly omits legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide").
  - Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., "€1,000" vs. ground truth's "€1 000"; extra offer for a flow diagram, which is unprompted and irrelevant).
  - Comprehensive but not concise: Ground truth uses a structured table + list for clarity; LLM's prose is more expansive, reducing precision.

The answer is substantively correct and useful but structurally misaligned, warranting a mid-range score with strict penalties for non-exact matching.
