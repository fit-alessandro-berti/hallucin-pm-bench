### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive) with no speculation or errors in content, aligning with the prompt's requirements and the XML snippets. Headings match the prompt exactly.

However, strict evaluation reveals minor but notable differences from the ground truth:
- **Presentation/order in lists**: LLM lists ID first (e.g., "check_vip (Check Customer VIP Status)"), while ground truth prioritizes name first with explicit ID notation (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). This inverts the focus and omits backticks/formal ID labeling, warranting a deduction.
- **Bullet style**: LLM uses "â†’" for items; ground truth uses "*" with inline formatting, creating a stylistic mismatch.
- **Gateway description**: LLM's concise phrasing ("gw_valid: from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway") lacks the ground truth's explicit "changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)", missing version indicators and bolding for emphasis.
- **Overall formatting**: Ground truth uses bold headings and a closing note ("*(No other differences should be reported.)*"), which LLM omits, slightly reducing completeness in matching the reference style.

These small presentation inconsistencies (not factual errors) result in a significant but not severe point loss under the strict criteria, as the core analysis is accurate and prompt-compliant.
