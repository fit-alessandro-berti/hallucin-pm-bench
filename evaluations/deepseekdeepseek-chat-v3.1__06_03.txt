8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Accuracy (9.0 base)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two concurrent sets from Process B, matching the exact tasks (`Quality_Check` and `Update_Inventory` for Set 1; `Generate_Replenishment_Report` and `Notify_Procurement` for Set 2) and their order, with no mention of Processes A or C. This aligns perfectly with the prompt's requirements and ground truth content.
- **Deductions for Differences**:
  - Unnecessary introductory phrase ("Of course. Focusing solely..."): Adds extraneous text not in the ground truth, violating conciseness (-0.3).
  - Phrasing and structure: Uses "parallel split" (which matches the process description) but describes it as "creates a set of two concurrent tasks" with bulleted lists, differing from the ground truth's "**Set X – [description]:** `Task1` ‖ `Task2`" inline format (-0.5 for format mismatch and verbosity).
  - Missing final statement: Omits "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," which explicitly closes the ground truth and reinforces completeness (-0.4).
  - Minor formatting: Italics (*) vs. backticks and no ‖ symbol for parallelism, small but noticeable inconsistencies (-0.3).
- **Strictness Applied**: Even though the functional response is nearly identical and fully addresses the prompt, these small stylistic, structural, and completeness differences warrant a significant but not drastic deduction, as the ground truth emphasizes a precise, minimal format. No major factual errors, so not below 8.0.
