7.1

The LLM answer captures the three correct worst-performing activities: **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**. It also provides a rationale for each and concrete, data-driven recommendations, staying within the requested word limit. However, the following errors and divergences from the ground truth substantially reduce its strict score:

**Major Issues:**

1. **Explanation Precision:**  
   - The LLM's explanations are more speculative/ambiguous. For example, for *Request_Documents*, it suggests "likely due to unclear requirements or customer delays", which is not strictly derivable from the numbers and can be seen as over-interpretation.
   - It does not explicitly mention the magnitude of throughput drops in its narrative, despite this being a key and visible data point in the table and highlighted in the ground truth.
   - For *Review_Documents*, it focuses on processing variability instead of the fact that this step has the highest mean processing time and a significant wait time and SLA breach, as the ground truth correctly highlights.

2. **Specificity and Concreteness of Recommendations:**  
   - Recommendations are vaguer or less directly actionable than those in the ground truth. For example, "streamline templates/checklists" for *Request_Documents* is nonspecific compared to "automatic, same-day digital requests with mandatory file-format validation”.
   - For *Review_Documents*, "Reduce variability with tiered review SLAs (e.g., splitting simple/complex cases) and training" is less targeted and doesn’t directly address the mechanisms seen in the data.
   - For *Initial_Assessment*, "expand FTE support during peak hours" is a more general staffing recommendation rather than a focused process change such as rule-engine triaging.

3. **Numerical Reference Weaknesses:**  
   - The memo sometimes refers to only vague thresholds (e.g., “>20% rework”) in its rationale rather than the actual measured values (e.g., “22 % rework” for Request_Documents).
   - There are missing references to certain standout features, e.g., the "throughput drop" from Register_Claim to Request_Documents is referenced briefly but not with actual numbers as highlighted in the ground truth.

4. **Missed Opportunity for Projections:**  
   - The ground truth gives a final impact estimate ("projected to lift end-to-end throughput by ≈10%..."), providing a forward-looking, executive-oriented outlook; the LLM answer omits this.

**Other Observations:**

- The LLM answer did not hallucinate or reference activities not present in the table (a positive).
- Word count and overall structure are on-spec.
- There are a few minor language imprecisions (“resources” typo as “ресурсов”).

**Summary Judgment:**
The answer is correct in activity selection and roughly in diagnosis, but suffers substantial point loss for lack of strict data-citation, less actionable recommendations, and occasional unsupported reasoning. Strict grading standards dictate a sub-8 score; significant errors in diagnosis/recommendation and failure to mirror the specific data-driven style of the ground truth place this at 7.1.
