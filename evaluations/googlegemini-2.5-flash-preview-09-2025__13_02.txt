6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (1 occurrence). Full credit.
- **Question 2a & 2b**: Exact calculations and rounding (2.08%, 8.33%). Full credit.
- **Question 3**: Partial credit. Word count compliant (≤100). Covers over-generalization (iii) adequately. However, fails to explicitly mention single-occurrence issue (i) beyond implying rarity (e.g., no "only once" or "single observation"). Does not note variance/instability (ii) from limited data (e.g., no discussion of noise, skewing, wide confidence, or collapse to 0%). Critically, invents unsupported details (e.g., "significantly faster without this manual step," "increased latency and resource usage," "critical... intervention") not derivable from the log—C05 actually completes faster (~1 hour total) than most cases (often 1+ day). Violates "only use the log; do not invent." Off-target focus on common-path overfitting rather than rare-activity instability. Significant deductions for these errors.

Overall: Numerics flawless (worth ~70% weight), but explanation (30%) has major flaws, justifying deduction from perfect 10.0.
