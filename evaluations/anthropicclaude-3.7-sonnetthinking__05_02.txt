The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the same core improvement (reducing the `camunda:dueDate` for `Task_CollectEquipment` from "P5D" to "P2D") without adding or deleting elements, and the diff is a valid single unified hunk with appropriate context; however, it deducts points for the extraneous introductory sentence violating the strict output format (diff followed directly by one-sentence rationale), minor rationale differences (lacks explicit reference to the 3-day contractual SLA and emphasizes acceleration over cycle containment, plus unnecessary detail on "system access"), and the ground truth's more concise, minimal diff presentation without line numbers or extra context lines as the ideal minimalism.
