The LLM answer correctly proposes attaching a boundary timer event to Task_Receive with duration PT48H and connecting it directly to Task_Triage, closely matching the ground truth. However, several issues cause point deductions:

- The LLM incorrectly refers to the new sequence/flow as an "escalation flow" and mentions "intermediate event-based sequence flow," both of which are imprecise BPMN terminology given no escalation event or intermediate event is defined in the ground truth.
- The answer states that the timer bypasses Task_Check and GW_Docs, but doesn't clarify that it also skips Task_RequestDocs, whereas the ground truth points out all affected steps.
- The answer says "without altering existing tasks or logic," but connecting the timer to Task_Triage does alter the flow logic, which the LLM doesn't acknowledge.
- The LLM unnecessarily suggests an “escalation flow” rather than a direct sequenceFlow, and "Use an intermediate event-based sequence flow" is confusing; ground truth explicitly calls for a new sequenceFlow (not another event).
- Some wording is ambiguous (e.g., “intermediate event-based sequence flow”) and not optimal BPMN vocabulary.

For these reasons, while the core suggestion is correct, terminology inaccuracy and lack of clarity warrant strict penalty.
