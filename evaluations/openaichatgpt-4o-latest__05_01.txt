7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core improvement (boundary timer on Task_Receive with PT48H duration, flowing to Task_Triage for bypassing), aligning with the ground truth's intent to enforce the SLA without new tasks. It references relevant IDs and stays under 120 words in plain English.

However, under strict criteria, deductions apply for:
- Omitting "interrupting" (critical for proper BPMN behavior; non-interrupting wouldn't bypass effectively; -1.5 points).
- No event ID (ground truth specifies "Timer_48h"; -0.5 points).
- Inaccurate terminology: "intermediate event-based sequence flow" is non-standard and misleading (should be a standard sequence flow from boundary event; -0.5 points).
- Lacks XML precision (e.g., no `<bpmn:timeDuration>` snippet; -0.5 points).

Overall, strong conceptual match but notable technical gaps reduce from a perfect 10.
