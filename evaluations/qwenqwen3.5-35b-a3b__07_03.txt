8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all verifiable functional changes: the three added tasks, the one removed task, and the two gateway type changes, with exact IDs, names, and change descriptions matching the XML diffs and prompt format specifications (e.g., "id (name)" and "id: old → new").

Minor deductions for formatting deviations from the ground truth:
- Absence of leading bullet points ("- ") before each item in all three sections (6 instances total).
- Lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway line under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").

These are small but verifiable textual differences under utmost strictness, warranting a significant but not catastrophic loss from 10.0. No other errors, guesses, commentary, or extraneous content.
