**1.0**

The LLM answer is entirely incorrect and directly contradicts the ground truth. Q1 claims "No" instead of "Yes," missing the key path via T2 → T7 → T4 to enable T5 without T3. Q2 provides a flawed explanation ignoring T7's role in producing P4 independently of T3, rather than the required minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5). No alignment with ground truth markings or logic; maximum differences warrant minimum score under strict criteria.
