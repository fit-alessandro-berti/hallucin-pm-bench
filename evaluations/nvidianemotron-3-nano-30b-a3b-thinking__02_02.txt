**5.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict line-by-line factual precision):
- **Q1/A1**: Perfect match (exact count "3"; extra case listing is accurate but unnecessary—minor deduction not needed). Full points.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match, including order, activities, and → separator. Full points.
- **Q3/A3**: Major errors—missing "Arrange_Delivery" (hallucination by omission; only "Check_Stock" listed despite evidence in log for C002), not alphabetized ("Arrange_Delivery" must precede "Check_Stock"), incomplete list (1/2 items), wrong format (not one per line with expected structure like "- "). Treated as full hallucination. Zero points.

Overall: 2/3 questions perfect → capped at 6.7 average, but strict policy for missing/fabricated elements + format mismatch deducts further to 5.0.
