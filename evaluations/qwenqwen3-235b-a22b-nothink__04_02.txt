### Evaluation Breakdown
The LLM answer follows the required format (status bolded, short justifications, all-caps overall result) but contains critical errors in content, leading to a low score under strict criteria. Key differences from ground truth:

- **R1**: Matches status and justification essence (correct, minor phrasing variation). No deduction.
- **R2**: Major error—status incorrectly "Compliant" (should be "Violated"); justification ignores Change_Request's impact on "last required approval" (Finance_Approval on 03-04, but new Manager_Approval needed post-change on 03-07, making Ship_Goods on 03-05 invalid as >2 days after final approval or premature). This is a fundamental misinterpretation, warranting heavy penalty.
- **R3**: Matches status and justification (correct). No deduction.
- **R4**: Matches status; justification equivalent (correct). No deduction.
- **R5**: Status correct ("Violated"), but justification factually wrong—claims new Manager_Approval "preceded further steps," but trace shows Ship_Goods (03-05) and Pay_Invoice (03-06) occurred *before* new approval (03-07 15:10), violating the rule. Significant error in explanation.
- **R6**: Matches status and justification (correct). No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correct "NON-COMPLIANT," but undermined by incomplete violation identification (misses R2's severity).

With two rules having substantive errors (one flipping status entirely, one inverting facts), accuracy is ~67% at best, but strictness demands substantial point loss for these impacting compliance analysis. Justifications stay ≤20 words, but quality failures amplify deductions.
