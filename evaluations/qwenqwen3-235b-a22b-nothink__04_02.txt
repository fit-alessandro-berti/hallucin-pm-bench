6.0

R1: **Compliant**. Correct—Manager and Finance approvals for > €10 000 are in order.
R2: **Compliant** (LLM), should be **Violated**. LLM fails to recognize that for expedited POs, the "last required approval" (after a Change_Request) is the second Manager_Approval (07-Mar-07 15:10), while Ship_Goods occurred on 2025-03-05, before the final approval and outside the required 2-day post-approval window.
R3: **Violated**. Correct—Pay_Invoice occurred before Receive_Goods.
R4: **Not Applicable**. Correct—hazardous = false.
R5: **Violated**, but the justification is misleading. The LLM said "new Manager_Approval preceded further steps," which is factually incorrect—Pay_Invoice and Ship_Goods occurred before the new Manager_Approval.
R6: **Compliant**. Correct—case ends with Archive_Record.

The LLM correctly flagged overall NON-COMPLIANT and R3/R5 violations, but it made a critical error on R2 (which is central for this test), and gave a misleading explanation for R5’s violation. These are major mistakes. The rest is accurate.

Thus, significant errors penalize the score, leading to a strict 6.0.
