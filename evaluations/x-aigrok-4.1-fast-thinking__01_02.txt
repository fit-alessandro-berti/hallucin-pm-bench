**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying all three decision points using exact activity names and listing all six required documents verbatim from the prompt without introducing forbidden terminology. However, under utmost strictness, multiple small-but-notable differences deduct points significantly:

#### Decision Points (minor deductions: -1.0 total)
- Matches core logic perfectly but omits contextual positioning ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") critical for a precise summary (-0.4).
- Adds unneeded details like "points", "continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)", and "proceed to" vs. GT's "send to" (-0.3).
- Formatting/emphasis mismatch: Bullets vs. numbered; "*approve* or *reject*" (lowercase italics) vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**" (uppercase bold) (-0.3).

#### Required Documents (minor deductions: -1.0 total)
- List identical in items/content, but phrasing tweaks: "≤ 3 months old" (+extra "old"; -0.2); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (+extra "single", "or" vs. "/"; -0.3); "(CIS) template" (+extra "template"; -0.2).
- Omits confirmatory note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") which reinforces completeness (-0.3).
- Bullets vs. numbered; heading "Every Required Document" vs. "(complete list)" (-0.2, formatting).

**Perfect match would be 10.0.** Deductions reflect ~20% divergence in precision/phrasing/context despite 80%+ overlap. No major errors (e.g., missing points/docs), so not below 8.0.
