9.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, listing "Quality_Check" and "Update_Inventory" for the first parallel split, and "Generate_Replenishment_Report" and "Notify_Procurement" for the second parallel split. The numbering of the sets matches the process order. It uses clear bullets, provides a brief contextual note for each, and focuses only on Process B as requested.

Small deviations:

- The answer adds *extra description* ("These tasks execute concurrently after...") not present in the ground truth.  
- It uses section headings ("Set 1", "Set 2") with Markdown syntax, slightly differing in format from ground truth (which uses numbers and bold).
- It does not explicitly restate "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," a phrase included in the ground truth.

These are minor format/style differences rather than content mistakes. Therefore, I deduct 0.5 points for these stylistic and completeness nuances, resulting in a score of **9.5**.
