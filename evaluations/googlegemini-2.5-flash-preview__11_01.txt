6.0

The LLM answer is generally correct in identifying and ranking the three worst activities by waiting time, and it quotes both average and 95p waiting times accurately for each. However, several strict mistakes and omissions, per the evaluation criteria, lead to significant point deductions:

**Positives:**
- Correct ranking of activities by waiting time: #1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability.
- Correct average and 95th-percentile waiting times quoted (verbatim).
- No unrelated metrics or activities mentioned.
- Memo stays concise and (nearly) within the word constraint.

**Negatives:**
- **Insufficient Data-Driven Justification**: The recommendations are generic; concrete, data-driven actions and explicit quantitative impact (“cut by ≥ 20%”) are absent. For example:
    - "Implement automated document request reminders" is less specific than "with 24 h escalation triggers; pilot tests show a ≥25 % cut" (Ground Truth).
    - "Automate closure letter generation..." omits specifics like "replace manual batch printing with same-day e-signature letters" and the estimated 30% reduction.
    - "Allocate dedicated assessment resources..." is weaker and less targeted than introducing a rules engine that pre-classifies, which is more data-driven and tailored.
- **Lack of Quantitative Estimate for Impact**: No minimum percentage reduction in wait time is claimed for any action, missing a key executive criterion.
- **Lacks Technical Specificity**: Actions are broad (e.g., "automate," "allocate resources") instead of evidence-based process redesigns as in the model answer.
- **Superficial Close**: The memo closes generically rather than driving home the business impact (“offers a significant opportunity...”).

**Summary:** While factually accurate regarding activity selection and waiting-time figures, the memo fails to provide concrete, data-backed improvement actions or state the ≥ 20% reduction. These absences are material for an executive audience. Thus, the score is reduced substantially to 6.0.
