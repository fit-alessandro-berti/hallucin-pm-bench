The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core conclusion (impossibility of computation/derivation due to absent temporal data) and reasoning (lack of timestamps/durations). Minor deductions for slight wording variances ("derived" vs. "computed"; added detail on benchmarks and redaction, which is accurate but expands beyond the ground truth's conciseness) and not explicitly warning against fabrication, though these do not substantively deviate.
