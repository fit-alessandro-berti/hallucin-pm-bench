The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, structure, values, and JSON validity (whitespace differences are irrelevant in JSON). All answers are correct per the event log facts:
- Q1: 3 distinct cases (A-9321, B-1045, C-77).
- Q2: Pack_Items immediately precedes Ship_Order in A-9321 (timestamps confirm sequence).
- Q3: Earliest timestamp is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00.
- Q4: Quality_Check occurs twice (B-1045, C-77).
- Q5: Activities never first: Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Ship_Order (firsts are Receive_Order x2, Quality_Check x1). No errors or deviations.
