10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and aligns precisely with the ground truth in content, structure of justification (citing all relevant CaseIDs and sequences), and conclusion. No factual errors, omissions, or deviations; minor presentational differences (narrative vs. table) do not impact correctness or adherence to the task requirements.
