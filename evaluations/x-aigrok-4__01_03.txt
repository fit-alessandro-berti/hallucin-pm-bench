8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall, demonstrating close adherence to the process description with no hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML elements) and precise summaries in part (a). However, under strict criteria, it incurs a notable deduction in part (b) for incorrectly treating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as non-unique and omitting it from the list, despite its explicit mention as a distinct required document in step 8â€”resulting in one missing item and an incomplete enumeration (8 vs. 9 documents). Minor extras like step references and introductory phrasing are unnecessary but not deductively severe; part (a) is nearly identical in substance, with only cosmetic phrasing variances (e.g., "grant approval" vs. "record 'Approve'"). This yields a high but not perfect score, penalizing the substantive list error by ~1.5 points.
