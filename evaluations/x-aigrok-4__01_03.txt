7.5

a) The LLM accurately identifies the two decision points as defined in the process and summarizes their rules very closely to the ground truth, with no substantive errors. The sentence structure/paraphrasing is a bit more verbose and less direct than the ground truth, but the logic and requirements are correct and not missing or incorrect. Phrasing such as "does not proceed" on TriVote is slightly less explicit than "may advance only when…" but this is a minor issue (no factual error).

b) The most significant deviation is in the documents list: The ground truth lists both "Offer Sheet 77" and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as two required documents (the offer and the signed acceptance are considered distinct), while the LLM answer states: "Signed Offer Sheet 77 is a required signed variant of 'Offer Sheet 77' but is not listed separately as a unique document." Thus, the LLM omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" from its sequence, effectively providing 8 items instead of 9 and collapsing two sequential deliverables into one. There is also a slight clarity issue in the way the LLM phrases “without duplication,” which does not precisely match the instruction to list all required documents in order of first appearance, treating distinct steps as distinct documents even if related. This is a noticeable error and counts as a significant deduction, since the distinction is explicit and material in the process.

No hallucinated documents occurred, and the order for the remaining documents is correct.

Because a distinct, required document is omitted and there is some imprecision in mapping offer vs signed-offer, I deduct 1.5 points for that error (as instructed, even small omissions are significant). The rest is largely accurate (decision logic, ordering, and document names), so the answer is overall quite solid, but not perfect or excellent.

**Score: 7.5**
