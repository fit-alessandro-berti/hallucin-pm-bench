**9.8**

1. The LLM answer gets the count (1), the percentages (2.08% and 8.33%), and the two-calculation methods 100% correct.  
2. The explanation for #3 is concise and clearly highlights:  
   - The single-occurrence/low-support issue  
   - Unstable/outlier-driven statistics  
   - The danger of generalizing from such rare events  
   It also connects the error to performance/predictive analyses.

**Deduction:**  
The only difference with the model ground truth is wording nuance in part 3: the LLM explanation slightly condenses some aspects (no explicit mention of wide confidence intervals, but does refer to “statistics...heavily influenced by an outlier event” and “fails to reliably represent overall behavior”). The LLM does not explicitly mention the possibility of the event never occurring again in future data, and the statement about resource allocation/risk assessments—while nicely relevant—is less focused than the reference answer.

**Minimal error—overall, extremely close match.**  
**Hence: 9.8**
