The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match precisely (2.08% and 8.33%, with correct calculations). Question 3 adheres to â‰¤100 words, directly addresses the single-occurrence issue ("appears only once"), highlights variance/instability ("influenced by an outlier," "unreliable"), and cautions against over-generalization ("inaccurate... if assumed typical"), without inventing data. No deviations or errors.
