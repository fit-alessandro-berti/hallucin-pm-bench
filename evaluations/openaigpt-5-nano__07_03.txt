The LLM answer is functionally accurate, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for formatting deviations from the ground truth: absence of bullet points ("- ") before each list item across all sections (6 instances), and minor misalignment in the second gateway entry (missing spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" for visual alignment). These small but consistent structural differences warrant a significant deduction from a perfect score.
