8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all changes, with accurate IDs and names/types as required. However, it does not strictly follow the formatting prescribed in the prompt and ground truth. Specifically:
- Bullet points ("-") are missing for each item, which is required by the format in the ground truth answer.
- For gateways, the LLM omits the indentation/alignment presented in the ground truth.
- Task entries do not have hyphens in front as in the ground truth.

These small formatting deviations—while the content is otherwise fully accurate—warrant a significant deduction according to the instruction for strictness. However, no factual mistakes are present, so the score is high but not maximized.
