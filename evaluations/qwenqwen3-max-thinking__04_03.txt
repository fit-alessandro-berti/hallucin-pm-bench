**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall verdict**: Correct ("No"), +2.0 points.
- **Rule assessments** (strict per-rule matching to ground truth; 2.0 points possible per rule, total 8.0):
  | Rule | LLM | Ground Truth | Match? | Points |
  |------|-----|--------------|--------|--------|
  | 1    | Labeled "violated" despite self-contradictory explanation of satisfaction | ✔ Satisfied | ❌ No (clear mislabeling) | 0.0 |
  | 2    | Satisfied | ✔ Satisfied | ✔ Yes | 2.0 |
  | 3    | Violated (correct reasoning) | ❌ Violated | ✔ Yes | 2.0 |
  | 4    | Labeled "violated" (incorrect; adds interpretive "tainting" not in rules or GT) | ✔ Satisfied | ❌ No (direct contradiction) | 0.0 |
- **Format/Structure**: Prose bullets vs. GT table; lacks clear ✔/❌ symbols; longer/unnecessary elaboration (e.g., "undermines validity," "primary violation"). -1.0 points (from possible bonus for precision).
- **Strictness adjustment**: Two major per-rule errors (mislabeling violations where GT explicitly satisfies) and self-contradiction on Rule 1 warrant significant deduction; no partial credit for "essence" under utmost strictness.

Total: 4.0/10.0 (unacceptable deviations despite correct top-level answer).
