### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high alignment, minimal deductions)**: Perfect match on core identification of the **three worst-performing activities** (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Exact quantification of excesses. References cases counts from data (GT omits per-activity cases but invents total). ~180 words (close to ≈150). Bullet points **only** for recommendations. No invented metrics/activities. Data-grounded throughout.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences)**: 
  - Header/structure: Lacks GT's "From:", "Subject:", bolding/emphasis, "Recommended actions" subheader, and closing projection (-1.0; less executive polish).
  - Intro phrasing: "The data identify..." vs. GT's total-cases "Analysis... largest queues" (-0.3).
  - **Recommendations**: Completely different content (-1.5; LLM generic/data-referential like "reallocate capacity... reduce 600s", GT inventive/specific like "rule-based pre-checks... bypass"; zero overlap despite both "concrete"). LLM adheres better to "data-driven/no invent" but diverges from GT.
- **Overall**: 80% factual/quant core match, but format/recs differences warrant strict penalty (not identical). No small errors overlooked.
