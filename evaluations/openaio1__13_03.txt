7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (1 occurrence identified correctly). Score: 10.0.
- **Question 2**: The response correctly identifies the small sample size (3 cases, 1 day) and risks of extrapolation to the full month, staying under 120 words and data-bound. However, it lacks depth on key ground truth elements: no quantification of sample tininess (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours), dramatic frequency swings for rare events (e.g., 0% to 7%), wide confidence intervals, or sampling error specifics. Critically, it omits the distortion from near-synonyms like "Automatic Fraud Check" and "Fraud Check (Automatic)" under strict vs. fuzzy matching, which is a central reason for misestimation in process mining. These omissions make it less precise and analytical for a senior analyst. Score: 5.0.
- **Overall**: Strong on core idea but incomplete and less rigorous; strict deduction for missing nuances.
