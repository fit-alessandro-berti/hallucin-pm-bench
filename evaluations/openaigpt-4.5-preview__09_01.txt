The LLM answer fully aligns with the ground truth in conclusion (cannot compute/derive the value) and reasoning (lack of timestamps/durations prevents calculation, avoiding any fabrication). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed," explicit mention of redaction vs. general "lacks") do not constitute errors, as both accurately reflect the context and system instructions without introducing inaccuracies or unsupported claims.
