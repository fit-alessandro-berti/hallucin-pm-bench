The LLM answer correctly identifies that the calculation cannot be performed because the event log lacks any data rows or timestamps. It explicitly notes the absence of necessary information and does not speculate or introduce external knowledge. 

However, compared to the ground truth, it could be slightly more precise in referencing that "all event rows and every timestamp have been redacted," echoing the rationale in the ground truth. The LLM answer's wording "no data rowsâ€”only the header is provided" is accurate but could reflect the explicitness of the ground truth ("all event rows and every timestamp [...] have been redacted") to be maximally strict and fully aligned.

Thus, a slight deduction is warranted for not perfectly matching the exact phrasing and completeness of the ground truth answer, though the content is fundamentally correct.
