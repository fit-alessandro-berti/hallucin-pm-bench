The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and precision: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to the redacted event log (no rows or timestamps), explicitly addresses all required metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval), and provides a concise, one-paragraph explanation without guessing or extraneous details. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "no data rowsâ€”only the header" vs. "only column headers") do not constitute errors under strict evaluation.
