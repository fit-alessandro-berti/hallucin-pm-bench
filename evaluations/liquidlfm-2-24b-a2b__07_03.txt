3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **ADDED TASKS**: IDs correct, but parentheses contain fabricated "(Task_Id: [id])" instead of actual names from XML (e.g., "(Automated Fraud Check)"). Violates "id followed by the name in parentheses". 3 major formatting/content errors → severe deduction.
- **REMOVED TASKS**: Swaps order to name first ("Manual Review"), then wrong "(Task_Id: Task_ManualReview)" format. Does not match "id followed by the name in parentheses" (should be "Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)"). Major format error → severe deduction.
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: First entry correct. Second entry critically wrong: `Gateway_Payment` changed from `exclusiveGateway` (v1) to `parallelGateway` (v2), so "exclusive → parallel" (direction "Converging" unchanged but irrelevant). LLM fabricates "converging (unchanged) → converging (unchanged)", mentions "unchanged" (forbidden: "Do NOT mention elements that are unchanged"), and misidentifies type. Violates "list only verifiable differences" and format. 1/2 correct → halved points here.
- **Overall**: All sections deviated (no perfect match), extra inventions/commentary, ignores XML verification (e.g., gateway types). Minor: extra whitespace/line breaks. Strict policy: small errors = significant loss; this is multiple large errors → low score (3.0 reflects partial ID accuracy but total non-compliance).
