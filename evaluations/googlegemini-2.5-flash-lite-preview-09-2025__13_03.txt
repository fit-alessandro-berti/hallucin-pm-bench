### Evaluation Rationale
**Part 1 (Count):** The LLM answer correctly identifies exactly 1 occurrence for “Manual Fraud Check” (CaseID 1002), matching the ground truth precisely. No deductions here.

**Part 2 (Explanation):** The response stays within ~110 words and correctly notes the small, potentially non-representative sample and the presence of similar activities (e.g., automatic variants), which could lead to underestimation of manual checks' commonality. It avoids overt speculation by focusing on sampling limitations. However, it earns deductions for strictness: it does not quantify the snippet's tininess (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), explain statistical volatility (e.g., frequency swinging from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events), or explicitly address string vs. fuzzy matching risks with near-synonyms. These omissions reduce depth and precision compared to the ground truth, resulting in meaningful point loss despite overall coherence.
