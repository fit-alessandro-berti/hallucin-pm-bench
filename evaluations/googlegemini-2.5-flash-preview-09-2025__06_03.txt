The LLM answer accurately identifies the two concurrent task sets in the exact order specified, with no extraneous information about other processes. It matches the ground truth semantically and in structure (numbered lists). Minor deductions for: (1) using "and" instead of the ‖ symbol for parallelism (a small representational difference); (2) lacking the descriptive labels (e.g., "Set 1 – first parallel block:") and backticks; (3) omitting the closing sentence; and (4) adding an unnecessary title. These are stylistic/formatting variances but not substantive errors, warranting only a slight reduction from perfection under strict evaluation.
