7.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **R1**: Matches status and justification intent (Compliant, approvals in sequence for high amount). Full points.
- **R2**: Major error - wrongly Compliant (ignores Change_Request triggering new approval as "last required"; Ship_Goods precedes final Manager_Approval by >2 days). Status and justification incorrect. Severe deduction.
- **R3**: Matches (Violated, Pay before Receive). Full points.
- **R4**: Matches (Not Applicable, hazardous=false). Full points.
- **R5**: Status matches (Violated), but justification incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice as pre-new-approval step; focuses on Ship/Receive only). Minor deduction.
- **R6**: Matches (Compliant, ends with Archive). Full points.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). Format closely follows prompt (bold status, ≤20 words).
- **Strictness adjustment**: R2 substantive misinterpretation of rules/interdependencies costs ~3 points; R5 wording ~0.5; total from 10.0 baseline yields 7.0.
