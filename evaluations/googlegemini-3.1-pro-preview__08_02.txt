The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth: correct "Yes" for Q1, identical minimal sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, and accurate prose explanation matching the path logic and token preservation in P2/P5. Stylistic differences (prose vs. marked markings; comma-list vs. numbered) are superficial and do not affect correctness, completeness, or brevity (explanation ~75 words ≤120). No errors or omissions.
