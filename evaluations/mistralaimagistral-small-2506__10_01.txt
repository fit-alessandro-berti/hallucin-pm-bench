4.0

**Justification:**

- **Terminology**: The required terms “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” are correctly used and the forbidden alternatives do not appear. (+2)
- **RACI Accuracy**: The matrix is almost entirely incorrect with respect to a proper RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) mapping:
    - Only "Responsible" (R) is ever given; "A" (Accountable), "C" (Consulted), and "I" (Informed) are completely absent. (-2)
    - As a result, *all roles* except the Responsible one in each row are left blank—whereas in the ground truth, Accountable is always clearly assigned (often to the Account Manager), and Consulted and Informed are meaningfully present across all activities. This flattens nuance and renders it a non-RACI assignment. (-1.5)
- **Structure**: The addition of a "Description" column is harmless but unnecessary; minor deduction for deviation from the requested format. (-0.5)
- **Compliance with role naming**: Role names and abbreviations are fine.
- **Wording and self-awareness**: Minor, unnecessary explanations about adherence to vocabulary at the end, but not a significant issue.

**Summary**: The answer rigorously applies vocabulary policy and is structurally close, but fundamentally fails to fulfill the RACI concept due to lack of Accountable, Consulted, and Informed assignments. This is a major process-mapping omission and worth a strict downgrade.
