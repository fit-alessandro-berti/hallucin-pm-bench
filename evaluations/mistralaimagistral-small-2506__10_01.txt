4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Correctness (Partial Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization, and avoids forbidden variants entirely. This aligns perfectly with the policy and ground truth (+2.0 points).
- **RACI Allocations (Major Deduction)**: The LLM identifies the single *Responsible (R)* role per activity accurately, matching the ground truth's R assignments (e.g., AM for Receive Application and Order Vetting, CO for KYC Review). However, it completely omits *Accountable (A)* designations (e.g., no R/A for AM in Receive, Order Vetting, and Notify Customer), *Consulted (C)*, and *Informed (I)* roles, leaving nearly all cells blank. A proper RACI matrix requires specifying involvement for *all* roles per the standard framework; this renders it incomplete and non-compliant with the ground truth's full matrix (-4.0 points). Even small omissions in a strict RACI context (e.g., missing C/I implications from the process narrative) warrant significant loss.
- **Table Structure and Formatting (Deduction)**: The LLM adds an unwarranted "Description" column (rephrasing legacy process steps, which introduces redundancy and deviates from the concise ground truth format). Headers use abbreviations (e.g., "AM") instead of full names, and it includes bolding inconsistently (e.g., on role mentions in descriptions but not activities). The ground truth uses full names, bolds key activities/terms, and has no extras (-1.5 points). The added "Key" and explanatory text below the table introduce unwarranted content, bloating the response beyond the prompt's request for just the matrix (-0.5 points).
- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt and Narrative (Deduction)**: While the core process steps are covered without extras, the response fails to "reflect the narrative" fully by ignoring implied accountabilities and consultations (e.g., no C for CO in Order Vetting or I for IT in Notify Customer). No new tasks/roles are added, but the simplification undermines the RACI purpose (-1.0 point).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, even minor structural deviations (e.g., extra column, incomplete cells) result in outsized penalties. Total starts from 10.0 baseline, deducts to 4.0 for ~60% misalignment in completeness and extras.
