The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr` tasks, removed `send_rma_label` task, `gw_valid` gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive), adhering to the prompt's categories and using exact strings from the XML ids. No extra or incorrect items reported. Deductions for: using ids only instead of descriptive names + ids as in ground truth (-1.0); different phrasing/order in gateway change and missing v1/v2 labels (-0.5); minor formatting diffs in bullets (- vs *) and spacing/phrasing (-0.5). Factually perfect but stylistically divergent from ground truth under strict criteria.
