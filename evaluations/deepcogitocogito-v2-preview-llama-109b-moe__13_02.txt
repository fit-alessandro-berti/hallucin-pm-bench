**Score: 9.0**

**Evaluation:**

**Q1:** Correct. The answer states exactly 1 occurrence, which matches the ground truth.

**Q2a:** Correct calculation (1/48 = 2.08%) and rounded correctly. Matches ground truth.

**Q2b:** Correct calculation (1/12 = 8.33%) and rounded correctly. Matches ground truth.

**Q3:**  
- **i) Single occurrence issue:** Clearly mentioned ("only one occurrence in the log", "single instanceâ€¦")
- **ii) Variance/instability:** Notes skewing averages, inability to capture true variability, unreliable insights, and "we cannot reliably understand its patterns".
- **iii) Over-generalization caution:** Explicitly stated ("any analysis that generalizes from this sample might inaccurately assume its impact" and last sentence: "we cannot determine if this activity typically leads to payouts or rejections, or how long it normally takes to complete, as we only see one instance.")

However, there are some small flaws:
- The answer could be slightly more precise about the magnitude of the variance (e.g., mention "confidence intervals remain wide") and about how future data might affect generalisation.
- The phrase "statistical models might not capture the true variability of such infrequent events" is more vague compared to the explicitly statistical wording in the ground truth (e.g., "confidence intervals remain wide").
- The answer also says "statistical models might not capture the true variability" rather than "estimates collapse to 0," which is a nuance about what happens if the event never happens again. This is a subtle (but slight) lack of specificity.

**Summary:**  
All quantitative answers are correct and clearly stated. The OpenAI answer demonstrates full understanding, but lacks a bit of explicitness in statistical issues and consequence in future data, which, under very strict marking, loses 1 point. Thus, **9.0**.
