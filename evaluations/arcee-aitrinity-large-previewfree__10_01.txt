3.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary policy adherence (max weight, per prompt strictness)**: Perfect (10/10). Uses exact "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"; no forbidden terms. All three mandated synonyms present.
- **Structure and format**: Major differences (2/10). Correct rows/columns/order, but headers include unwarranted "(AM)" etc. (GT omits); no bolding on key terms/R as in GT; extra spacing/padding in cells; blanks vs. GT's fully populated table (24 cells filled in GT, only 6 'R's in LLM).
- **RACI correctness vs. GT and narrative**:
  - Responsible (R): Matches GT positions exactly (1 per row, aligns with "handled by/performed by"): 10/10.
  - Accountable (A), Consulted (C), Informed (I): Complete failure (0/10). LLM omits all (only R's + blanks); GT fully specifies them (e.g., AM as **R/A** or A frequently, per "AM Accountable where appropriate"; full C/I per role). Blanks do not "reflect the narrative" fully.
- **Unwarranted content**: None introduced (10/10). No extras.
- **Overall differences**: ~75% cell mismatch (blanks vs. specific letters); partial R credit insufficient under "utmost strictness" and "small errors significant loss." GT is comprehensive RACI; LLM is skeletal/minimalist, failing full matrix expectation. Total: 3.2 (pulled low by content gaps despite vocab/R wins).
