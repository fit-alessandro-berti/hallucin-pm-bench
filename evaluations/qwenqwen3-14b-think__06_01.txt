The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses one pair per line in the specified format. No extraneous pairs or references to Process A are included. However, under utmost strictness, the lack of column alignment in the second line (missing extra spaces after "Procure_Materials" to match the em dash position of the first line, as in the ground truth) constitutes a small formatting discrepancy, warranting a 1-point deduction.
