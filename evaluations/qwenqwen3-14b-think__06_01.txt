The LLM answer correctly identifies both parallel pairs, matches the alphabetical order within each pair, and outputs each pair on a single line in the required format. There is, however, a small but notable formatting mistake: the spacing between the two tasks in the second line is not consistent with the ground truth (one space before and after '—' in the LLM answer, while the ground truth has five spaces on either side for the second pair, likely for alignment). The answer otherwise matches the intent and requirements exactly.

Strictly, since the prompt stresses “utmost strictness” and that even small errors should lead to point loss, the inconsistent horizontal alignment between the lines—despite no impact on correctness or order—merits a minor but significant deduction.
