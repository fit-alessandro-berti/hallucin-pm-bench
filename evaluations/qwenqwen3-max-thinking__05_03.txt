3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major functional error (-4.0)**: Incorrect sequenceFlow target (`End_Rejected` vs. ground truth's `Activity_AMReview`). Ignores the explicitly noted "*Unused but existing escalation activity*" (`Activity_AMReview`), routing to outright rejection instead of escalation/review, violating the intent of using pre-existing elements for SLA enforcement.
- **XML inaccuracies (-2.0)**: Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (present in original XML conditions and ground truth); no `name` attribute on boundaryEvent; different IDs (minor but cumulative under strictness).
- **Justification mismatch (-1.0)**: Describes rejection routing, not escalation to existing task; fails to emphasize "pre-existing" activity as in ground truth.
- **Partial credit (+0.5)**: Correctly identifies interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H`; proper structure (XML block + 1-sentence justification); no new activities added.

Overall: Plausible but fundamentally divergent solution with multiple strictness-penalized differences.
