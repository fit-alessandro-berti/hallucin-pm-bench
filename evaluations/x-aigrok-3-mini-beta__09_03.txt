The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is not possible to compute the requested metrics due to the absence of data—all rows and timestamps have been redacted, only column headers remain. It also clearly explains why the necessary calculations (cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval) cannot be performed, echoing the ground truth’s reasoning.

Minor point lost (0.5) because the ground truth phrasing is slightly more precise, explicitly naming the missing “Approve Invoice” executions and noting the need for raw log entries. The LLM answer could have echoed this by explicitly stating that no “Approve Invoice” executions are available and more data would be necessary.

Otherwise, the answers are nearly identical in content and correctness.
