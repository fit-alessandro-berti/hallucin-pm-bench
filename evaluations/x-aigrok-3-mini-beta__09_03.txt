The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and precision: both concisely explain the impossibility in one short paragraph, citing the absence of data rows and timestamps (start_time/complete_time) as the precise reason cycle time (and derived metrics like std dev/95% CI) cannot be computed for "Approve Invoice," without guessing or extraneous details. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "dispersion" vs. explicit "standard deviation") do not constitute errors under the task's strict criteria.
