The LLM answer precisely matches the required output: correct pairs, alphabetical order within and across pairs, one per line, and adherence to the specified format (`Task_X  —  Task_Y` with two spaces before and after the em dash). The ground truth's additional alignment spacing on the second line is not mandated by the prompt and does not constitute a required difference. No errors in content, structure, or adherence to instructions.
