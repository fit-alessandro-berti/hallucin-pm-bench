**8.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate, provides a short, evidence-based justification with relevant case IDs (1001, 1003), timestamps demonstrating reversed order, and notes the cases "where both activities are present," implicitly acknowledging Case 1002's absence. This disproves "always" via counterexamples.

**Deductions (-2.0 total):**
- Omits explicit mention of Case 1002 (no Update_Inventory), a key point in ground truth for fully disproving "always" across *all* cases (-1.5; significant under utmost strictness, as meticulous analysis should cover every case).
- Lacks ground truth's structure ("Short verdict," line citations, final summary "in none of the three cases," explicit "immediately precede" negation) and phrasing like "claimed ordering is reversed" (-0.5; minor formatting/content differences). 

Core logic and brevity align well with the prompt; no guessing or errors in cited data.
