The LLM answer accurately identifies the claim as incorrect, correctly cites C002 and C004 as counterexamples, and clearly explains the sequences and the violations. The justification shows precise referencing to the event log, matching the analysis in the ground truth. However, it does not mention C001 or C003, where the fact does hold and which are explicitly noted in the ground truth as supporting cases. Including these would provide a fuller, more exhaustive answer and better mirror the comparative style of the ground truth. This omission of positive cases—despite correctly refuting the FACT—counts as a small but meaningful loss of completeness and thus, under strict grading, warrants a 1-point deduction.
