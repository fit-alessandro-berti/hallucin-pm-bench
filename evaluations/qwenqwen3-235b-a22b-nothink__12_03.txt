The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise, evidence-based justification using accurate sequences from the two relevant counterexample cases (C002 and C004), which logically disproves the "always" claim. This aligns well with the task's requirements to cite relevant CaseIDs and sequences. However, under utmost strictness, it loses a minor point for not comprehensively analyzing all cases (e.g., omitting confirmation of compliance in C001 and C003, as done in the ground truth's table), making it slightly less exhaustive despite being logically sufficient. No factual errors or additions beyond the log evidence.
