4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: Strong match (9/10). Both identify the exact two decision points with accurate rules. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., LLM uses "to pass" vs. ground truth's "record 'Approve'"; minor formatting/notation differences like comma in €250,000). These are small but warrant a strict point loss per instructions.
- **Part (b)**: Poor match (2/10). Significant errors include: (1) Grouping the three scorecards into one entry instead of listing them separately as distinct items (2–4 in ground truth), effectively omitting two separations; (2) Omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77" entirely as a required document (explicitly listed as 7 in ground truth, distinct from the unsigned version); (3) Incorrect order—ID Matrix Declaration appears after the unsigned Offer Sheet but should follow the signed version; (4) Resulting list is incomplete (6 items vs. 9) and adds an unnecessary explanatory note about scorecards not being "traditional documents," which deviates from the ground truth's straightforward listing. No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML docs), but omissions and inaccuracies are severe under strict criteria.
- **Overall**: Weighted average heavily penalizes the flawed document list, which is a core requirement. No adherence to ground truth's exact structure, bolding, or exhaustive detail.
