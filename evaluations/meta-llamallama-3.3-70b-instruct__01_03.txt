6.0

**Justification:**

**Part (a): Decision Points**

- The LLM answer **correctly identifies both decision points** (post-risk-check conditional branch; TriVote gate) and generally describes each, capturing the gist of their decision rules.
- However, **minor but important imprecisions exist**:
    - The second decision rule is slightly vague: "requires approvals from at least two out of three officers... to pass." The ground truth emphasizes that all three must consider, participation is mandatory, and "approve" records are the critical pass threshold.
    - The first is clear—but reiterates content ("step 5... skipped") instead of restating the outcome/action, as in the ground truth ("the process bypasses... otherwise it proceeds..."). The conditional logic is correct.

**Part (b): Documents**

- The LLM **incorrectly merges the three scorecards into a single bullet**, when the ground truth treats these as three distinct required documents, and they also appear separately in the process diagram.
- The LLM **omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77"** (required at step 8), which is explicitly included in the ground truth.
- The LLM **lists "ID Matrix Declaration" after Offer Sheet 77**, but per the prompt, both are requested together at step 8. More importantly, it is missing the explicit inclusion of "Signed Offer Sheet 77."
- The LLM provides a clarifying note about scorecards "not traditional documents," which is not required and slightly undermines the answer's focus.

**Overall:**
- The answers are largely correct in general structure, but the errors—condensing the scorecards, omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77," and lack of crispness in restating decision-point logic—are significant enough per your grading criteria ("small errors should reflect in significant loss of points").
- Thus, this merits a **6.0**—the basics are correct, but failure to enumerate all documents precisely and lack of strict alignment with the process rules cost notable points.
