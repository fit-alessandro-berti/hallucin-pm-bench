The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and formatting (with rounding to two decimals). For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (62 words), stays within the provided log data without invention, and addresses all required elements: single-occurrence/low-support issue (infrequent occurrence), variance/instability (skewing analyses, overemphasizing rare delays/costs), and caution against over-generalization (misleading when generalizing from slice to full log). No deviations or small errors.
