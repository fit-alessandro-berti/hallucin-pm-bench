The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets in the exact order and with the precise tasks from Process B, fully addressing the prompt without extraneous information. However, it loses points for minor deviations from the ground truth in formatting (e.g., using a header, bolded "Set X" instead of numbered list, bullet points instead of inline with â€– symbol, and descriptive phrasing like "after Parallel Split #1" instead of "first/second parallel block"), as well as omitting the explicit confirmation that no other tasks run in parallel, under strict evaluation criteria.
