7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: LLM correctly identifies 1 occurrence with precise reference (CaseID 1002). No errors. (10/10)
- **Q2 (major partial match, strict deductions)**: Shares core ideas (naming inconsistencies with examples; tiny sample risks misrepresentation). Word count compliant (~85 words). However:
  - **Speculation violation** (-2.0): Introduces unprompted hypothesis ("If manual checks follow similar irregular naming conventions"), breaching "no speculation" rule. Ground truth avoids this, sticking to observed auto variants.
  - **Imprecise stats** (-0.5): "33% (1 of 3 cases)" oversimplifies/misframes as case rate vs. ground truth's event-based "0% to 7%" swing (1/14 events), ignoring rarity/sampling error depth.
  - **Missing details** (-0.5): Omits time span (<2 hours), event count (14), confidence interval, "extreme sampling error for rare events."
  - **Less rigorous** (-0.5): Frames undercount risk speculatively; ground truth balances strict/fuzzy matching distortions neutrally.
  
Overall: Strong overlap but strict penalties for speculation, precision gaps yield 7.5 (not 10 due to "utmost strictness" on differences).
