7.0

**Justification:**

### Strengths:
- The LLM answer correctly identifies all required documents, listing each one named in the process and not introducing extraneous artefacts.
- It recognizes all major decision points fairly accurately, including eligibility check, the high-value (> €1 000) branching, reviews, and payment authorization.
- It correctly explains the needed criteria (e.g., which documents are used at each step).

### Issues and Point Deductions:
1. **Decision point structure and branching not explicit enough (−1.5):**
   - The LLM does not clearly detail the branching logic at each decision point (i.e., possible outcomes per decision). For example, it doesn't state the reject/approve flows as explicitly as the ground truth.
   - It splits the "high value decision" and the "senior auditor review" into two separate decision points; the former is a branch, the latter is a review. The ground truth treats the branching logically and only considers the auditor’s review as part of the high-value branch, not as a separate decision.

2. **Small imprecision at payment approval (−0.5):**
   - The LLM frames "Process_Refund_Payment" as a decision point, whereas per the process description, the real gating (final approval) occurs at "Finance_Controller_PreApprove" (and for high-value, with auditor review), with Process_Refund_Payment being contingent on those approvals having been granted.
   - This could suggest there’s a deciding action at payment, rather than payment being executed once the prior gates are cleared.
   
3. **Branching logic for outcomes not crisply stated (−1.0):**
   - The LLM does not clearly say, for example, that an ineligible claim is rejected, or that a negative outcome at controller/auditor review terminates the process without payment.
   - The explicit outcomes of each decision point are not given as per the table in the ground truth.

### Conclusion:
- The answer is accurate with all artefacts and documents, and contains all the right major "decision points."
- It loses marks for not being explicit about branching/outcomes, muddling the payment decision logic, and for not following the structural rigor of the ground truth.
- No fabricated steps or documents are introduced, which is crucial.

**Final score: 7.0** — Correct core content, but missing precision and structure required for top marks under strict grading.
