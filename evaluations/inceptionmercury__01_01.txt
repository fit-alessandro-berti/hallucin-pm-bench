6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially matches the ground truth but introduces significant inaccuracies and extraneous content in the summarization of decision points, warranting a moderate score under strict criteria. Key differences:

- **Decision Points (Major Flaws, ~4.0/10 Alignment)**:
  - Ground truth identifies exactly 3 precise decision points with structured branching logic (eligibility check, amount threshold, final approval), including explicit rejection outcomes (e.g., "Not eligible → claim rejected/returned"; "Rejected → process ends without payment").
  - LLM inflates this to 5 points, fabricating or mischaracterizing decisions: (1) Correctly notes triage but omits rejection branching; (2) Treats **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** as a standalone "decision to pre-approve" (not explicitly a branching decision in the process description—it's a sign-off); (3) Correctly identifies high-value threshold but frames it narratively without precise post-PreApprove placement; (4) Erroneously presents **Senior_Auditor_Review** as a distinct "decision on approval" (process description calls it a required review including *AuditTrail*, not a decider—ground truth folds it into final approval); (5) Invents a "decision to execute payment" at **Process_Refund_Payment** (this is execution contingent on priors per constraints, not a decision point; no branching specified).
  - LLM's narrative format lacks the ground truth's tabular precision and omits rejection paths, introducing ambiguity and non-standard interpretations. This violates the prompt's call for a summary of "every decision point" without introducing undefined elements.

- **Required Documents (Strong Alignment, ~9.0/10)**:
  - LLM lists all 7 documents accurately (*RefundRequestForm*, *FlightManifest*, *WeatherReport*, *EligibilityChecklist*, *AuditTrail*, *BankTransferAuthorization*, *RefundConfirmationPDF*), mirroring the ground truth. It correctly notes *AuditTrail*'s high-value context without error.
  - Minor deduction for narrative integration rather than a standalone numbered list, and the closing sentence adds unsubstantiated policy fluff (e.g., "ensures... thorough and compliant"), slightly deviating from the prompt's directive to avoid introductions.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (~6.0/10)**:
  - LLM adds an unnecessary introductory sentence and concluding remark, bloating the response beyond a strict summary. It adheres to "no legacy activities" but risks implying undefined decisions (e.g., payment as a "decision"). No hallucinations of new activities/artefacts, but the decision points section dilutes accuracy. Under utmost strictness, these cumulative errors (extra points, missing branches, invented decision framing) outweigh the solid documents list, preventing a higher score. A perfect match would require exact decision count, branching details, and concise structure.
