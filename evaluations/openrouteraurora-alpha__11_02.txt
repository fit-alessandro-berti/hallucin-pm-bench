**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (high baseline score)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), matching GT. Explanations cite table metrics directly (e.g., wait 150 min, rework 22%, processing 25 min). Provides one concrete, data-driven action per activity. Memo format concise (≈150 words), professional, ≤200 words limit. No mentions of absent activities.
- **Key Differences/Deductions (significant point loss per strict criteria)**:
  - **-0.4**: Fails to highlight throughput drop (190 cases/day) for Request_Documents, a key differentiator GT emphasizes as "drops to 190" explaining flow bottleneck.
  - **-0.5**: Omits Review_Documents' 30 min wait time (GT: "preceded by a **30 min** queue"), weakening "why" explanation; relies on processing/SLA/rework only.
  - **-0.6**: Initial_Assessment explanation hallucinates "breach is above the overall average" (no overall average in table; requires unstated computation ≈2.8%, violates "strictly on the table"). "Exceeds the next best activity" is vague/unsubstantiated (ambiguous "next best").
  - **-0.3**: Actions good but less precise ties to data (e.g., arbitrary "30% reduction"/"<15 min" vs. GT's "halve rework"/"trim processing time"). No end-to-end impact projection like GT.
- **Overall**: 90%+ alignment in structure/content, but small factual omissions, vagueness, and one hallucination trigger outsized deductions (per instructions). No guessing on unclear rankings (clearly differentiated).
