7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, focusing on factual accuracy, completeness, phrasing, structure, and adherence to the prompt's requirements (e.g., using exact activity names, no standard terminology). Even minor omissions, rephrasings, or structural differences result in point deductions, as per the instructions. The LLM answer is strong in core content but has notable gaps in specificity and positioning for decision points, while documents are nearly identical (with the LLM actually closer to the original prompt in some phrasings). Breakdown:

#### Decision Points (Score impact: -2.0 points; total deduction basis for ~75% match)
- **Completeness and Accuracy**: The LLM correctly identifies the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and describes their logic accurately, matching the prompt's flow (e.g., ≤2 points difference, escalation to Harmonisation Committee, <€15,000 auto-approval, ≥€15,000 to MBA, board vote). No introduction of standard loan terms. However:
  - Omits key details from ground truth: Does not specify "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" (ground truth explicitly names them); does not note the gate as a "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" or the threshold as "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (ground truth includes these positional clarifications for context in the flow).
  - Phrasing differences: Uses descriptive bullets ("If... continue/escalate") vs. ground truth's concise "*If... ⇒ continue/escalate*" notation. For MBA, LLM uses lowercase "*approve* or *reject*" with italics, while ground truth capitalizes "**Approve** or **Reject**" with bold—minor but a stylistic mismatch under strict evaluation.
- These omissions make the summary less precise and contextual, reducing fidelity to the ground truth's level of detail.

#### Required Documents (Score impact: -0.5 points; ~95% match)
- **Completeness and Accuracy**: LLM lists all six exact documents from the prompt, using precise terminology (e.g., "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template", "(≤ 3 months old)"). Structure as bullets is clear and matches the prompt's intent.
  - Vs. ground truth: LLM is actually more faithful to the prompt in phrasings (e.g., includes "single" in income statement and "template" for CIS, which ground truth shortens/omits; "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"). Ground truth adds an extraneous note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") not in the prompt or LLM, which is unnecessary but doesn't penalize the LLM. Numbered list vs. bullets is a trivial structural difference.
- Minor deduction only for not matching the ground truth's numbering and slight formatting (e.g., no bolding), but no factual errors.

Overall, the LLM answer is concise, accurate, and prompt-compliant but loses points for lacking the ground truth's specific details and notations in decision points, treating them as "small errors" with significant impact. A perfect 10.0 would require near-identical structure, phrasing, and details.
