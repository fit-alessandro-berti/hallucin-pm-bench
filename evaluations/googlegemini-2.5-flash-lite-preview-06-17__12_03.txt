6.0

The LLM's answer is factually correct and succinctly identifies the primary violation in CaseID C002, correctly concluding that the FACT is inaccurate. However, it is overly terse and incomplete by strict standards. It only cites one case (C002) and does not comprehensively check all cases: most notably, it omits C004, which is equally important as it features *Check_Fraud* between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*. The justification fails to provide a complete, case-by-case analysis as shown in the ground truth, and does not mention the cases in which the FACT actually holds (C001 and C003), nor the proportion of violating cases.

Deducting significant points (−2 for incomplete analysis, −1 for lack of full referencing, −0.5 for omitting contextual clarification, −0.5 for not quantifying violations), this leads to a score of **6.0**.
