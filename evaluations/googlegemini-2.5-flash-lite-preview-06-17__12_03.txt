The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No") and provides a valid justification by citing one relevant counterexample (C002) with the accurate sequence, which is sufficient to disprove the "always" claim. However, under utmost strictness, the justification is incomplete compared to the ground truth: it omits the second counterexample (C004, where "Check_Fraud" intervenes between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment"), fails to acknowledge compliant cases (C001 and C003), and lacks the comprehensive case-by-case analysis or tabular structure of the ground truth. This partial coverage represents a notable difference in thoroughness and evidence citation, warranting a deduction despite the overall correctness.
