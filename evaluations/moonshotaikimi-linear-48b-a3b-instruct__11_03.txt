### Evaluation Rationale
- **Activity Selection (Major Deduction: -4 points)**: The prompt requires identifying the three worst-performing activities *jointly* based on SLA breaches *and* high waiting times. Ground truth correctly selects Legal Approval (+300s exceed, 600s wait), Risk Review (+300s, 480s wait), and Credit Assessment (+60s, 200s wait) as the clear top offenders from the table. LLM incorrectly includes Verify Identity (+30s exceed, 80s wait) instead of Legal Approval, which has far worse metrics (600s wait vs. 80s; tied +300s exceed with Risk but higher wait). This core mismatch in analysis skews the entire memo and violates data-grounding, warranting severe penalty under strict criteria.
  
- **Quantification of Exceeds (Significant Deduction: -1.5 points)**: Ground truth uses precise absolute seconds (e.g., "+300 s"). LLM inconsistently mixes percentages (e.g., Verify "33%" is roughly correct but not absolute; Credit "125% beyond" is mathematically wrong—300s is 25% over 240s, or +60s; Risk "double" implies +100% over). This introduces errors and deviates from data-direct presentation, with small calculation inaccuracies amplifying loss per instructions.

- **Recommendations Structure and Content (Moderate Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Instructions specify "bullet points *only* for the recommendations." Ground truth uses a dedicated bulleted section under "**Recommended actions**." LLM embeds them inline under each activity header (e.g., "Actions: ..."), violating the format. Content is somewhat data-driven (e.g., referencing times/cases) but less specific/concrete than ground truth (no equivalents to "low-risk files" or "peak morning window," though both invent slightly beyond table—LLM's are vaguer). Still, format breach is a clear, non-small error.

- **Overall Structure, Length, and Fidelity (Partial Credit: +4 points baseline adjusted)**: Memo format is present (To/From implied, intro/conclusion), ~150 words matches, data-grounded where possible (e.g., times, cases for Risk), and no absent activities/metrics invented. Closing differs (Sincerely vs. projection paragraph), and intro phrasing varies, but core memo style aligns somewhat. No major inventions like ground truth's "€25 k" or "35%," which helps slightly, but differences in tone/subject line reduce similarity.

Total reflects utmost strictness: Functional but fundamentally flawed in selection, accuracy, and format adherence, leading to low alignment with ground truth.
