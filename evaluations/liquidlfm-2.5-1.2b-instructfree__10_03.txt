1.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Violations (Critical Failure, -3.0 pts)**: Uses forbidden "Sanctions Check" (must be "AML Screening"). Zero use of mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring"). Policy is **STRICT**; no synonyms allowed.
- **Table Structure Errors (-2.0 pts)**: Inverted (roles as rows, not activities). Columns misuse RACI labels as if assigning to roles instead of activities vs. roles. Ground truth has activities as rows, roles as columns.
- **Incomplete Coverage (-2.0 pts)**: Misses key activities (e.g., no "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "Risk Scoring", "Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). Only 1 invalid activity named; treats roles as "activities".
- **RACI Assignments Wrong (-1.5 pts)**: Fabricated entries (e.g., "All roles" is invalid shorthand; no matches to ground truth like **R,A** notations, dashes). Ignores process flow.
- **Other (e.g., Markdown Formatting, No Additions/Merges Violated but Irrelevant, -0.5 pts)**: Poorly formatted; adds invalid content.

**Total: 1.0** (baseline for total non-compliance; no partial credit per strictness directive).
