4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) and accurately quantifies SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s) with supporting throughput and waiting times, matching the ground truth core analysis. However, significant differences reduce the score under strict criteria:

- **Structure and Format (major deduction: -3 points)**: Lacks formal memo elements like "To/From/Subject" and the integrated paragraph-style intro referencing "completed cases" (ground truth specifies "4 805"); uses a numbered list instead of bolded, non-numbered entries. Recommendations section is similar in bullet format but titled differently ("**Recommendations**" vs. "**Recommended actions**"). Ending summary is generic and untied to projections, unlike the ground truth's specific "35% reduction" and "SLA compliance" projection.

- **Introduction and Context (moderate deduction: -1.5 points)**: Omits case count analysis and phrasing like "materially breach service targets while accumulating the largest queues," making it less detailed and data-grounded in tone.

- **Recommendations (major deduction: -1 point)**: Completely different actions (e.g., LLM suggests "automated document verification" vs. ground truth's "rule-based pre-checks"; no mention of "peak morning," "â‚¬25k," or "straight-through heuristic"). While both are concrete, the lack of alignment indicates invention divergence, violating closeness to ground truth. LLM ties more directly to provided metrics (e.g., "480s waiting time"), but this doesn't offset the mismatch.

Word count is approximate (LLM ~120 words vs. ground truth ~150), with no factual errors in data usage but overall less comprehensive. Total reflects partial alignment on key facts but substantial stylistic and content variances.
