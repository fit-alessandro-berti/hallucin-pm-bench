The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifies "No" and provides the exact two key counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 lacking Receive_Order) matching the ground truth, disproving the "always" claim with precise citations. It adheres strictly to the prompt's format ("No" followed by one paragraph). Minor deductions for extraneous details (timestamps, explicit mention of Cancel_Order on line 12, and phrasing like "further disproving" vs. ground truth's "clear counter-examples") that, while factually correct, introduce slight stylistic and content bloat not present in the gold-standard, violating utmost strictness on differences.
