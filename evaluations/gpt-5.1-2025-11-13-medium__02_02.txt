The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth in all substantive content: Q1 correctly identifies 3 cases (extra listing of case IDs is accurate and non-fabricated); Q2 exactly matches the sequence; Q3 correctly lists the two distinct preceding activities in alphabetical order, one per line, with no extras or omissions. Minor formatting differences (e.g., explanatory headers, lack of bullets) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they align with the prompt's instructions without altering facts. No hallucinations or deviations.
