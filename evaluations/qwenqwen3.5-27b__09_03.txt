The LLM answer is highly accurate and semantically equivalent to the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A (no rows, timestamps, or "Approve Invoice" instances), explicitly addressing all required metrics (average cycle time, std dev, 95% CI), and dismissing Artefact B's irrelevance. Minor deductions for: slightly verbose length exceeding the "one short paragraph" ideal (GT is more concise); "95 percent" vs. precise "95 %"; phrasing like "mathematically impossible" and detailed B explanation as additions not in GT; lack of GT's punchy "Impossible —" opener and "Additional raw log entries are required" closer. Under utmost strictness, these phrasing/style variances warrant a small but noticeable penalty despite near-perfect fidelity.
