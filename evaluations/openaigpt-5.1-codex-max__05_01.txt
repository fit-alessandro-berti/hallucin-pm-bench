3.5

The LLM answer captures the general pattern (interrupting boundary timer event + sequence flow to `Task_Triage`) and SLA compliance intent but diverges significantly from the ground truth in critical ways, warranting major deductions under strict evaluation:

- **Wrong attachment point**: Timer on `Task_RequestDocs` vs. ground truth's `Task_Receive` (core mismatch; changes the BPMN modification entirely).
- **Incorrect timer configuration**: `timeDate` like `submittedAt + PT48H` (vague, non-XML, hedged with "or relative") vs. precise `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`.
- **Missing details**: No timer ID (`Timer_48h`), no XML snippet, less emphasis on "no new tasks" reuse.
- **Phrasing/explanation differences**: References `Start_Claim` explicitly; wordier but alters bypassing logic description.

These are not minor—placement alone invalidates equivalence. Partial credit for structure and ID references.
