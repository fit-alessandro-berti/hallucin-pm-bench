The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth, accurately identifying both sets of concurrently executable tasks (from both parallel splits), numbered and listed in order. The only minor discrepancy is in presentation: the LLM refers to "Set 1" and "Set 2" with clear enumeration and moderate formatting, but doesn’t add clarifying text on "No other tasks...," nor does it explicitly mention "first/second parallel block" or use ‖ notation. Additionally, the LLM does not use code-formatting for the task lists.

Strictly following instructions, this should cost a point for the slight difference in explicitness and formatting, but otherwise the answer is precise and unambiguous.
