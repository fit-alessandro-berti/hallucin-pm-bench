The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets in Process B, matching the ground truth in core content and numbering. However, it deducts points for: unnecessary introductory sentence (not in ground truth); verbose wording like "Set 1: **Quality_Check** and **Update_Inventory** (branches from Parallel Split #1)" instead of concise "**Set 1 – first parallel block:** `Quality_Check` ‖ `Update_Inventory`"; use of "and" rather than the parallel symbol "‖"; bold formatting vs. code-style; and omission of the explicit closing statement "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," which affirms completeness per the ground truth. These stylistic and minor structural differences, though not factually erroneous, warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
