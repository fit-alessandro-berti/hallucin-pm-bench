The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in identifying the non-compliance (violations of Rules 2 and 3) and correctly assessing the satisfied rules (1, 4, 5). Key details, such as event positions and rule interpretations, match except for a minor calculation discrepancy in Rule 3 (distance reported as 4 instead of 3, though the violation conclusion remains correct). The format deviates slightly (violations listed first with non-sequential numbering for satisfied rules, plus an unneeded "For completeness" section), but the numbered justifications adequately cite rules without introducing errors. Under strict evaluation, this deducts a small amount for the distance error and structural difference.
