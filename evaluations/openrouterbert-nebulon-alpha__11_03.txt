6.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict criteria applied):
- **Core identification (30% weight)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Perfect match. (+3.0)
- **Quantification of SLA exceeds (20% weight)**: Core excesses match exactly (+300s/+300s/+60s). However, invents unsupported percentages (50%, 100%, 25%) not in table/data—violation of "ground in data; do NOT invent metrics." (-0.8) Net: +1.2
- **Recommendations (30% weight)**: Provides one concrete action per activity in bullet points. Actions are plausible but invent non-table metrics/references ("40% based on historical case complexity data," "30% of manual reviews per pilot results," "50% as demonstrated in prior tests," "$50K," "FICO >700," "≈40% of cases")—multiple "do NOT invent" violations, more egregious than ground truth's vaguer inventions. Not truly data-driven. (-1.5) Net: +1.5
- **Format/Structure (10% weight)**: Memo style with subject/greeting/closing similar but divergent (e.g., "Dear COO" vs. "To:"). **Critical violation**: Uses bullet points for activity analysis ("- **Legal Approval**..."), contravening "bullet points **only** for the recommendations." Bullets correct only for recs. Adds signature/CTA. (+0.3) Net: +0.3
- **Fidelity to instructions (10% weight)**: ≈150 words violated (LLM ~280 words vs. ground truth ~110). Adds ungrounded claims ("impacting... customer experience," "delaying downstream," "root causes"). Returns only memo (ok). (-0.8) Net: +0.2

**Total: 6.2**. Strong on core analysis/quant but penalized heavily for format violation, invented metrics/references, and excess length/content per strictness mandate. Ground truth is closer to "only memo text" and avoids fake data citations.
