### Evaluation Score: 3.5

#### Reasoning for Score
This evaluation is conducted with utmost strictness, penalizing deviations from the ground truth answer, including incomplete RACI assignments, even if the prompt's narrative is ambiguous. The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy (using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly, with no forbidden terms), and it accurately identifies the primary Responsible (R) roles based on the process description (e.g., AM for Receive Application, Order Vetting, and Notify Customer; CO for KYC Review; FC for Payment Clearance; IT for Record Update). This earns baseline points for partial correctness in core Responsibles and no unwarranted additions (no extra tasks, roles, or columns).

However, significant deductions apply due to multiple critical differences:
- **Incomplete RACI assignments (major penalty, -4.0 points)**: The ground truth provides a full RACI matrix with Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) roles inferred from the narrative (e.g., AM as A for Receive Application, KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, and Notify Customer; CO as C for several steps; FC and IT as I or C where appropriate). The LLM only assigns R and leaves all other cells blank, incorrectly claiming A, C, and I are "not applicable" based on the "simple sequence." This ignores the rubric's emphasis on "RACI allocations reflect[ing] the narrative" with exactly one R *and* AM as A "where appropriate" (e.g., AM's oversight role in the workflow). Each mismatched cell (nearly all non-R cells) counts as a small error, but collectively they represent a fundamental incompleteness, warranting severe loss.
- **Structural and formatting mismatches (moderate penalty, -1.5 points)**: Headers include abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") not present in ground truth; bolding is inconsistent (e.g., only new terms bolded in rows, R bolded in cells); no combined notations like "**R / A**" or "**R**" as in ground truth. The added "Key" section introduces explanatory content not in ground truth, which could be seen as minor bloat despite not violating "unwarranted content" strictly.
- **No self-awareness issues**: N/A as per rubric, no deduction.

Overall, while vocabulary and basic Rs are flawless (supporting the 3.5 floor), the sparse, non-inferential matrix deviates substantially from the detailed ground truth, failing to fully "reflect the narrative" in a RACI context. A perfect score requires near-identical alignment; this is ~40% matching at best.
