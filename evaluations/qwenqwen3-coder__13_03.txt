7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the count as 1 for question 1, though it adds unnecessary details (e.g., CaseID) not in the ground truth, warranting a minor deduction for deviation from minimalism under strict evaluation. For question 2, it aptly covers small sample size and non-representativeness (staying under 120 words), aligning partially with the ground truth's emphasis on unreliability. However, it omits critical elements like precise sample quantification (14 events, <2 hours, 3 cases), statistical impacts (frequency swings, wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events), and especially the distortion from near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and string-matching issues, leading to significant point loss for incomplete coverage of misestimation risks.
