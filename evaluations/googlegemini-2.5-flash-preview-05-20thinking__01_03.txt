7.2

**Reasoning and Justification:**

a) **Decision points**  
− The LLM answer accurately identifies both decision points:  
 (1) The skip/bypass of Manual Underwriting Review based on risk AND amount  
 (2) The TriVote approval gate and its two-of-three rule  
− The first summary could be slightly crisper about the *else* outcome (i.e., if not Low/Medium or amount > €250k, you DO go to manual review).  
− The LLM specifies “Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5) is skipped,” which is close, but could be more precise by stating that if the condition is not satisfied, the review is performed.  
− For TriVote, “at least two out of the three required officers” is accurate.

b) **Documents**  
− List is mostly correct but omits “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” which is a distinct required document and is present in the ground truth.  
− The LLM does include both “Offer Sheet 77” and “ID Matrix Declaration,” but, notably, lists “Offer Sheet 77” and “ID Matrix Declaration” immediately after each other, not specifying "Signed" Offer Sheet 77 (required in Step 8).  
− The LLM does not hallucinate any KYC or unrelated documents—this is GOOD.

**Deductions:**  
-1 point for missing “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” which is clearly a required document (per prompt: "Request-Applicant-Confirmation — Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration")  
-1 point for not making absolutely clear in the first decision point that if the skip condition is *not* met, manual underwriting is performed (though this is minor, as the primary focus is on what the “if” does).  
-0.5 for slight imprecision in document order and terms.  
-0.3 for not specifying that the documents list should explicitly reflect "first appearance" (not a major issue, but some ambiguity).

**Total deduction:** ~2.8 points

**Strict evaluation**:  
7.2 is appropriate for an otherwise competent answer with a nontrivial but not dramatic error in the critical documents list, and minor imprecision in summarizing the decision branch.
