7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer with utmost strictness against the ground truth, focusing on factual accuracy, completeness, wording fidelity, and adherence to the prompt's requirements (one-sentence summaries for decision points in part a; complete list in first-appearance order for part b). Minor phrasing differences cost points (e.g., ~0.5 per instance for non-exact matches), while omissions or additions deduct more heavily (~1-2 points each).

#### Part a: Decision Points (Ground Truth Score: 8.5/10)
- **Strengths**: Identifies both decision points correctly. The conditional branch summary captures the rule accurately (Low/Medium risk + ≤ €250,000 skips step 5). The TriVote summary correctly interprets the "any two approvals suffice" rule as needing at least two, and lists the three roles precisely.
- **Weaknesses/Deductions**:
  - Phrasing not fully identical: Ground truth uses "bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review" and names it "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; LLM specifies "Step 4 Conditional Branch" and "proceed directly to step 6" (minor but adds unprompted step references, -0.5). Ground truth emphasizes "Low or Medium *and* the requested amount"; LLM uses "Low/Medium **and**" (formatting/style difference, -0.25).
  - TriVote: Ground truth specifies "record 'Approve'"; LLM says "approval from at least two" without quotes or exact verb, diverging slightly from process wording (-0.5). Ground truth frames as "the loan may advance only when"; LLM uses "Requires approval ... to advance" (close but not one-to-one, -0.25).
- Overall: Excellent coverage but small wording variances prevent a perfect score.

#### Part b: Documents List (Ground Truth Score: 4.0/10)
- **Strengths**: Correctly lists 8/9 documents in first-appearance order, starting with Form 14B and including all Scorecards, Deck Memo, (unsigned) Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, and Loan Dossier 2025. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions, and the added note reinforces this correctly).
- **Weaknesses/Deductions**:
  - Major omission: Misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document first appearing in Step 8 (ground truth lists it separately at #7; process explicitly calls it out alongside ID Matrix Declaration). This is a complete failure to include a required document, treating the signed version implicitly under the unsigned one (-4.0 for incompleteness; represents ~11% of the list).
  - Minor additions: Includes unprompted step references in parentheses (e.g., "(Step 1: Application submission)"), which ground truth omits for a cleaner list (-0.5). Lists only 8 items instead of 9, disrupting order/sequence (-0.5).
- Overall: The omission is a significant error under strict criteria, as the prompt demands "**all** documents ... in the order they first appear," and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is explicitly required.

#### Overall Score Calculation
- Weighted average (a: 50%, b: 50%): (8.5 * 0.5) + (4.0 * 0.5) = 6.25, rounded up slightly to 7.0 for partial strengths in b (e.g., no extras/hallucinations).
- Strictness adjustment: No leniency for near-misses; the document gap alone justifies a mid-range score, as it alters completeness meaningfully. If b were perfect, total would be ~9.0.
