7.5

**Evaluation:**

a) Decision Points

- The LLM covers both major decision points with clear, accurate one-sentence descriptions. There is some minor phrasing difference relative to the ground truth, but the substance is correct:  
  - For the conditional branch, it accurately specifies the criteria (Low/Medium and ≤ €250K) and the outcome (skip or proceed to manual review).
  - For the TriVote, the required approval threshold is described as "at least two of the three roles," matching the ground truth's "at least two of the three approvers."
- Very minor point deduction: The LLM's wording for the TriVote ("to advance to preparing the binding offer") is a little less specific than the process step, which is for the loan to move forward generally.

b) Documents

- The LLM lists the required documents in the correct order of first appearance until step 7.
- **Omission:** The LLM answer lists "Offer Sheet 77" and "ID Matrix Declaration" at step 8, whereas the correct list must include "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct, subsequently required document (not just the original Offer Sheet 77).
- This is a non-trivial omission: "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is explicitly required as a new document at step 8, not simply a reuse of the unsigned document from step 7. The absence of this item is a significant but not catastrophic error.
- All other items are included, and no hallucinated documents are mentioned.

**Summary:**

- The answer is detailed, accurate, and sticks closely to the process description.
- The two decision points are well summarized, with only slight difference in wording.
- The most material error is the omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a required document in the process flow.
- This small but significant error warrants a deduction, resulting in a score of 7.5 out of 10. 

If the "Signed Offer Sheet 77" had been included, the answer would merit a score near 9 or higher. The omission, given your strictness criteria, prevents a higher score.
