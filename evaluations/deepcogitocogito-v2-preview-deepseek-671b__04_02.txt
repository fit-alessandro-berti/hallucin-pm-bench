The LLM answer correctly identifies compliance for R1, R3 (violated), R4 (not applicable), R5 (violated), and R6, with overall NON-COMPLIANT matching the ground truth. However, it errs significantly on R2 by deeming it Compliant (based on initial approvals) instead of Violated, failing to account for the new Manager_Approval on 07-Mar as the "last required approval" post-Change_Request, which delays the timeline beyond 2 days for Ship_Goods (a core misinterpretation tied to R5). Justifications for other rules are concise (mostly â‰¤20 words) and align, but the R2 error reflects flawed reasoning and reduces accuracy. Extra explanatory text deviates from the prompt's strict format, though the summary section approximates it.
