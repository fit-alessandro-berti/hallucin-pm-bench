5.0

**Justification:**  
The LLM answer is thorough and well-structured but contains a major error for R2:

- **R1 – Correct (Compliant):**  
  Both LLM and key mark as compliant with a suitable justification.

- **R2 – Incorrect (Should be Violated):**  
  **LLM says "Compliant", but this is incorrect.**  
  After a Change_Request (which happened after approvals), R2’s "last required approval" is the *new* Manager_Approval (07-Mar), *not* the original Finance_Approval (04-Mar). Ship_Goods was on 05-Mar—thus, Ship_Goods happened *before* the new approval, and more than two days *before* the final approval, so R2 is violated.  
  This is a substantial, foundational error: **LLM failed rule logic and timing.**

- **R3 – Correct (Violated):**  
  Both LLM and key mark Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods as a violation, with good justifications.

- **R4 – Correct (Not Applicable):**  
  Both answers correctly see hazardous = false.

- **R5 – Partly Correct (Violated):**  
  Both answers identify violation, but the LLM explanation misses that Pay_Invoice is also a "further processing step" after Change_Request lacking intervening approval. The LLM only names Ship_Goods, so this justification is incomplete.

- **R6 – Correct:**  
  Both mark as compliant and give correct justification.

- **Overall result:**  
  LLM reaches the correct final verdict (**NON-COMPLIANT**).

**Additional notes:**  
- The answer is over-length and only sometimes keeps to the ≤20-word justification requirement.
- The slow and narrative format is more verbose than the concise tabular ground truth.

**Summary:**  
- Major error in R2: marks rule as compliant, when it is violated (based on the "last required approval" after change).
- Incomplete justification for R5: misses all required effects.
- Correct for R1, R3, R4, and R6.
- Correct overall verdict.

**These are significant errors; strict marking requires a heavy point reduction. 5.0 is assigned.**
