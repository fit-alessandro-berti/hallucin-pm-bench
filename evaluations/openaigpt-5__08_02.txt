The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) as the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3. The explanation accurately describes token movements and the disabling of T3, staying under 120 words.

Minor deductions for: (1) lacking step-by-step markings (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}), which the ground truth includes for clarity; (2) less structured sequence formatting (simple list vs. numbered steps); (3) slightly more concise but less confirmatory phrasing on T3's disablement. No factual errors, but these format/detail differences warrant a strict 1.0-point loss from perfection.
