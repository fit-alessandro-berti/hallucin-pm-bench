9.0

The LLM answer is almost entirely correct, giving both the correct answer to Q1 ("Yes") and providing a valid minimal firing sequence for Q2. The transition sequence provided (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) is correct, as is the reasoning that after T5 fires, T3 is no longer enabled due to the consumption of the P2 token.

Minor errors/omissions:
- The LLM answer omits explicit step-by-step marking updates (states/m₁, m₂, etc.) between transitions, which are present in the ground truth.
- The explanation is slightly less detailed, lacking the final clarifying sentence from the ground truth ("Because T5 consumes the token in P2, T3 is subsequently disabled, confirming that T5 can indeed precede T3 in an admissible execution.").

These minor omissions cost it a full point under strict grading. Thus, the answer earns a 9.0.
