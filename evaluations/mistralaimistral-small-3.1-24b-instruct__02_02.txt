The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content and structure for all three questions: Q1 correctly states 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the precise sequence; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities alphabetically, one per line. Extra explanatory text and log reprinting are non-factual additions but contain no errors, hallucinations, or deviations, so no deduction is warranted under strict factual precision criteria.
