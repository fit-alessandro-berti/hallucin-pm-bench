10.0

The LLM answer is factually and structurally identical to the ground truth:

Q1: States there are 3 distinct cases â€” correct.
Q2: For C002, provides the (correctly ordered) activity sequence, with correct separator and no typos.
Q3: For the activity immediately before "Ship_Order", it finds "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock", and lists them one per line, alphabetically.

There are no extra, missing, or incorrect elements, not even minor formatting deviations.
This deserves a perfect score under the strict grading criteria.
