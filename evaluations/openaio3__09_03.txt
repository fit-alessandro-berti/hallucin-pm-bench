The LLM answer accurately identifies the impossibility of computation due to the redacted event log (Artefact A), precisely explains the missing data (timestamps for "Approve Invoice"), and covers all required metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, confidence interval) without guessing or extraneous details. It adheres to the "one short paragraph" instruction. Minor deductions for slight phrasing variations (e.g., not explicitly naming "Artefact A" or suggesting "additional raw log entries," as in the ground truth) and using "durations" (implied but not directly in headers) instead of "dispersion," but these are negligible and do not affect core correctness.
