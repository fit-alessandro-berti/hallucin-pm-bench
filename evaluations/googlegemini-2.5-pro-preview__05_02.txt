3.0

The LLM answer does not match the ground truth in both approach and implementation; these differences are significant:

- The ground truth proposes a minimal change strictly by modifying one attribute (`camunda:dueDate` of "Collect Equipment" from `P5D` to `P2D`).  
- The LLM answer alters **sequence flows**: it reverses the order between "Grant System Access" and "Collect Equipment" by swapping source and target attributes in multiple `sequenceFlow`s, thereby changing overall activity order.
- This violates the intended solution's spirit, which focuses on SLA improvement through *deadline tightening*, *not* process flow rearrangement.
- The LLM's rationale justifies its change reasonably, but such a reordering was not expected, as the optimal fix was simply reducing a deadline.
- The task instructions permit only one attribute modification or reversing **one** sequence flow direction if strictly necessary, but the LLM alters multiple flows, exceeding the constraint.

Such a solution is much more intrusive than required and does not match the model answer; thus, a very low but nonzero score (the change is to an allowed element, but the wrong fix and multiple changes) is justified.
