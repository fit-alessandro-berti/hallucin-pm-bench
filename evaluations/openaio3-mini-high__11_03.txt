### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (accurately quantified as +300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s), grounded solely in table data without invention. Memo length ≈180 words, close to 150-word target. Uses bullet points only for recommendations, as required. Returns only memo text.
- **Weaknesses (major deductions for strictness)**: Lacks full executive memo structure (e.g., no "From" or "Subject" line, unlike ground truth's professional header). Omits total cases reference (ground truth mentions "4 805 completed cases," even if approximate). Activity order differs (Risk Review first vs. ground truth's Legal Approval first), altering emphasis. Descriptions are wordy and repetitive (e.g., restates throughput/waiting redundantly) without bolding or concise formatting matching ground truth. No closing projection on impact (e.g., ground truth's "35% reduction" ties actions to outcomes, absent here). Recommendations are data-driven (e.g., references 480 cases/wait times) but vague and non-concrete ("analyze distribution," "reevaluate workflow," "optimize steps") compared to ground truth's specific, actionable proposals (e.g., "add one risk analyst," "deploy heuristic for loans under €25k"), despite prompt requiring "concrete, data-driven action"—this is a significant shortfall, as small execution gaps in concreteness warrant point loss. Overall, ~40% structural/content divergence from ground truth.
