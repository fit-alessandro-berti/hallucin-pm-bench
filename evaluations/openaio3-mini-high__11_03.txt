7.0

The LLM answer is generally accurate and identifies the correct three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment). It quantifies by how much each activity exceeds its SLA and reports correct throughput and waiting times, matching the data.

However, the following issues cause notable point deductions:

- The recommendations given are quite generic: "analyze the distribution," "reevaluate workflow," "optimize process steps." In contrast, the ground truth specifies concrete, data-driven interventions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "automate score retrieval," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"). The lack of specificity is a significant fault given the instructions.
- The opening paragraph is less concise than the ground truth and lacks direct reference to the total case volume mentioned in the ground truth.
- The LLM answer does not synthesize an overall impact projection (e.g., reduction of end-to-end cycle time by ~35%), present in the ground truth.
- The LLM’s language is slightly more narrative and less memo-formatted than the ground truth, which had a stronger subject line and more clarity in communication.
- The ground truth memo includes headers and more precise information flow ("To:... From:... Subject:..."), which the LLM omits.

Due to these shortcomings—primarily the generic nature of recommendations and absence of some finer details—a strict evaluation yields a 7.0.
