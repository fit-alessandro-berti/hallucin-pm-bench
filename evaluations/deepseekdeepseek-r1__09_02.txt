The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, closely matching the ground truth in structure, reasoning (lack of timestamps preventing cycle time calculation), and explanation (only counts provided), with only minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; no explicit mention of "duration information" or "intervals") that do not alter the core meaning.
