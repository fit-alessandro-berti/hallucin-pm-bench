**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision points:**
- The LLM correctly identifies the two main decision points, captures the risk/amount skip rule, and the TriVote decision gate. Its wording ("passes when at least two out of three required officers ... approve") matches the required 2-of-3 rule, and the first conditional is accurately stated.
- However, the LLM answer is slightly less precise in matching the ground truth's phrasing regarding bypass vs. proceeding to review, and does not explicitly state that the alternative is "otherwise, proceed to Manual-Underwriting-Review." This is a reasonable minor omission. Still, the essential logic is accurate.

**b) Documents:**
- The LLM lists all the process documents in nearly the correct order and correctly avoids including any hallucinated ones.
- **Major error:** The LLM misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a required document at the "Request-Applicant-Confirmation" step. Instead, it lists just "Offer Sheet 77," which is prepared earlier, but omits the critical requirement to obtain the applicant's signed copy.
- "Scorecard–Cyan," "Scorecard–Magenta," and "Scorecard–Yellow" are treated as documents by the LLM (which matches the ground truth).
- The sequence is correct for those present.
- It does not combine "Offer Sheet 77" and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" into one, but misses listing the "Signed" version separately, which is a significant oversight.

**Strictness per requested criteria:**
- The only errors are (1) omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77," and (2) very minor wording imprecision on "bypass/proceed" in the decision points.
- According to the user’s criteria, even small errors should cause significant point loss.

**Summary:**
- Both tasks attempted rigorously.
- The missing "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is a non-trivial/document-logic error and warrants a notable deduction.
- No hallucination or gross misunderstanding.
- Remaining aspects are accurate.

**Score: 6.2**
