6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 8.0/10):** The LLM correctly identifies both decision points and summarizes their rules in one sentence each, aligning closely with the ground truth in content and structure. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "skip" vs. explicit "bypasses ... otherwise proceeds"; "passes" vs. "may advance only when ... record 'Approve'"), which under strict criteria warrant a noticeable point loss despite overall accuracy.
- **Part (b) - Documents (Score: 4.0/10):** The list is incomplete, omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document (first appearing in Step 8, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in Step 7). This violates the "ALL documents" requirement and disrupts the first-appearance order, resulting in only 8 items instead of 9. The order of included items is correct, but the omission is a significant error under strict evaluation, costing heavy points. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), which avoids further deduction.
- **Overall:** Weighted average reflects strong performance on (a) but critical failure on completeness in (b), with strict penalties for even phrasing nuances. Total differences from ground truth justify a mid-range score.
