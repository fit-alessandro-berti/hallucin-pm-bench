**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in all key aspects: correct "No" verdict, accurate per-rule assessments (all satisfied except Rule 3, with precise violation reasoning), references to each rule as required, and equivalent concise justification. Minor stylistic differences (bullets vs. table; added event positions, which are factual and supportive) do not constitute errors under the prompt's requirements. No factual inaccuracies, omissions, or violations detected.
