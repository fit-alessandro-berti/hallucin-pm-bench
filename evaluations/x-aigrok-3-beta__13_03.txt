8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part 1 (Score: 10.0)**: The count is exactly correct (1 occurrence), matching the ground truth. The additional details (CaseID and timestamp) are accurate and derived directly from the data, adding precision without speculation or error.

**Part 2 (Score: 8.0)**: The explanation correctly identifies the small sample size (3 cases, one day) and naming variations as sources of misestimation, staying under 120 words (~85) and avoiding speculation. However, it lacks the ground truth's strict emphasis on quantitative fragility (e.g., 14 events, <2-hour span, frequency swinging from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events) and deeper dive into matching pitfalls (strict vs. fuzzy). These omissions reduce depth on statistical unreliability, warranting a deduction despite overall relevance.

**Overall**: Strong alignment on core facts and reasoning, but misses nuanced statistical insights for full fidelity to ground truth.
