**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: Q1 wrongly claims "No" (ground truth: "Yes"); ignores T7 path producing P4 (via T2→T7→T4→P5, leaving P2 for T5); provides irrelevant sequence where T3 precedes T5; explanation fabricates dependency ("P4 produced by T3" only). No alignment with ground truth sequence or reasoning. Major errors warrant minimum score.
