6.0

The LLM answer demonstrates reasonable effort to mirror the vocabulary policy and the process structure, but it contains several notable issues and deviations from the ground truth. Here’s a critical breakdown:

**Strengths:**
- Does not use disallowed synonyms; strictly employs only “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring” for activities. No forbidden terms appear in the matrix.
- All four roles and all the required activities are represented.

**Major Issues (point deductions):**
- **Incorrect RACI Assignments:** There is significant divergence from the ground truth not only in who is "Responsible" and "Accountable" for each activity, but also in misuse of Consulted and Informed for several roles and steps. For example:
    - “Intake Vetting”: Ground truth has Front-Office Analyst as “R, A”, but the LLM splits this, assigning only “Responsible” and not “Accountable”.
    - “KYC Review” and “AML Screening”: Ground truth always has the Compliance Analyst as both “R, A”; but LLM only gives them “Responsible”, and splits Accountable elsewhere or leaves it out.
    - “Risk Scoring”: Compliance Officer is “Accountable” in the ground truth, but LLM doesn’t ascribe this.
    - LLM creates an “Approval (if >70)” row, but fails to use the mandated “Compliance Officer Approval” label, and sometimes mis-allocates “Accountable” to the wrong activity or role.
    - LLM splits “Schedule Payment” and “Release Funds” into multiple steps, drifting from the ground truth, which merges “Release Funds” (including scheduling).
    - Many spurious “Consulted” designations where not warranted.
- **Extra/Altered Activities:** LLM answer adds non-ground truth activities, such as “Schedule Payment” and “Notify Originating Analyst”—these were not distinct activities in the original and thus should not be present per instruction to "not...add activities".
- **Missing or Incorrect Formatting:** Dashes (“–”) are not used for uninvolved roles; instead, all cells are filled (often with "Informed"), which diverges from ground truth presentation.

**Minor Issues (additional deductions):**
- “Risk Scoring” is not bolded (as it is in ground truth), though this is minor.
- “R, A” notation is not used – instead, “Responsible” and “Accountable” are always split, never joint, not following the concise style of the ground truth.

**Summary:**
The LLM answer faithfully avoids off-limits vocabulary, which is critical, and maintains all the mandated activity headers for the four key activities. However, significant errors in activity row naming, spurious additions to the process narrative, and substantial RACI assignment mismatches greatly diminish its correctness.

Score: **6.0** (Strict according to the instructions: major errors and any small errors result in notable deduction from a perfect score.)
