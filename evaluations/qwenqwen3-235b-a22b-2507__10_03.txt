### Evaluation Breakdown
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the core requirements but exhibits numerous deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, ~2 points)**: Correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no disallowed synonyms leaking in. However, added activities like "Approval (if >70)", "Schedule Payment", and "Notify Originating Analyst" introduce unauthorized phrasings and conditions not aligned with the prompt's strict vocabulary policy.

- **Structure and Activities (Major Deduction, -4 points)**: The prompt mandates covering "every activity and role described" without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM adds three extraneous activities ("Approval (if >70)", "Schedule Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst") and splits others (e.g., separating "Schedule Payment" from "Release Funds"), resulting in 8 rows vs. the ground truth's 6. This violates the "do not ... add activities" rule. Additionally, no bolding of activities, no combined "R, A" notations, and no dashes (–) for no involvement—format mismatches are evident (e.g., separate cells for each RACI role instead of consolidated per column).

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction, -3 points)**: Significant inaccuracies across nearly all cells compared to ground truth:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office Analyst correct as Responsible but misses Accountable; Compliance Analyst is Informed (vs. Consulted); Compliance Officer is Informed (vs. –); Treasury Ops correct as Informed.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: Compliance Analyst misses Accountable (R only); Front-Office Analyst is Informed (vs. –).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office Analyst is Informed (vs. Consulted); Compliance Officer is Consulted (vs. Accountable).
  - Added "Approval (if >70)": Mismatches ground truth "Compliance Officer Approval" (e.g., Compliance Analyst Informed vs. Consulted; Treasury Ops Consulted vs. –; Officer Responsible only, missing Accountable; includes condition "(if >70)" which renames/escalates unauthorized).
  - "Schedule Payment" and "Release Funds": Not in ground truth as separate; assignments differ (e.g., Officer Accountable vs. Consulted for Release; no Schedule in ground truth).
  - "Notify Originating Analyst": Entirely added and ungrounded.
  These errors affect ~70% of cells, with small mismatches (e.g., Informed vs. Consulted) treated as significant per instructions.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt and Narrative (Minor Credit, +1 point)**: Attempts to cover the process flow and roles comprehensively, deriving some logical RACI from the narrative (e.g., Treasury Ops Responsible for Release Funds). However, it over-interprets by adding unprompted activities, failing to mirror the ground truth's consolidated interpretation (e.g., treating KYC/AML as distinct but both under Compliance Analyst R,A; omitting separate Schedule/Notify).

The answer is functional as a basic RACI but strays too far from the ground truth in structure, additions, and precision, justifying a score below 5.0. No criminal or jailbreak issues detected.
