The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in conclusion ("No") and justification: it correctly identifies all cases (C001, C002, C003, C004), accurately describes the sequences for each (immediate in C001/C003; intervening "Pack_Items" in C002 and "Check_Fraud" in C004), and explains the violation of the "always" claim due to these counterexamples. Minor stylistic differences (narrative vs. tabular format, inclusion of internal reasoning) do not introduce errors or deviate from the required elements (Yes/No answer + case-specific citations), so no point deduction is warranted under strict evaluation.
