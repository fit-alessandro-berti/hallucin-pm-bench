The LLM answer correctly identifies that the FACT is inaccurate, provides the required "No" at the beginning, and follows up with a clear, case-by-case justification. It accurately references the relevant CaseIDs (C001, C002, C003, C004), provides the activity sequences, and explains specifically for which cases the FACT is contradicted. The structure and logic are strong and detail-oriented.

**Differences/Error(s):**
- The LLM answer does not structure the justification using a table, as seen in the ground truth, but this is stylistic and not a significant error per se.
- The LLM provides the answer "No" as item 1, then a thorough prose justification for item 2, but doesn’t provide the explicit "Immediate successor?" binary notation (✅/❌) as in the ground truth. Again, mostly presentational.
- The ground truth makes more explicit the assessment “Because two out of the four cases violate…”—the LLM, while clear, could have summarized with an explicit fraction.

**Deduction:**  
Small presentational/stylistic differences and slight lack of explicit tabular summary or clear marking of all cases cause a slight deduction, but nothing in the core process-mining analysis or the evidence citation is incorrect.

**Final Score:** 9.3
