The LLM answer is functionally correct and aligns well with the ground truth by adding an interrupting boundary timer on "Activity_CreateAccount" connected to the existing "Activity_AMReview" without new activities, but it loses points for technical inaccuracies (missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration`, inconsistent with the original model's style for expressions), arbitrary but non-matching element IDs and names (e.g., "Boundary_Timer_CreateAccount" vs. "Boundary_LateCreate"; "CreateAccount SLA Timer" vs. "48h breach"), and minor justification phrasing differences, treated strictly as small errors per evaluation criteria.
