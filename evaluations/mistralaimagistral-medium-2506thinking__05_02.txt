The LLM answer proposes an incorrect modification (altering "Task_GrantAccess" instead of "Task_CollectEquipment"), fails to reduce the overall process duration to meet the implied 3-day SLA (instead extending it further), provides a mismatched and multi-sentence rationale, deviates from the exact output format (including extraneous summary and boxed element), and does not produce a proper unified diff hunk with @@ markers, resulting in a complete mismatch with the ground truth.
