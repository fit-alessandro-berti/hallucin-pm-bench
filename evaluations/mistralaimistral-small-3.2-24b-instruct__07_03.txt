- Significant formatting error: The LLM answer uses hyphens and inconsistent indentation, while the required headings must be exact and without preceding hyphens as per the ground truth.
- The task items in the LLM answer are prefixed with hyphens instead of the correct bullet list style (as in the ground truth).
- The gateway type changes section uses hyphens instead of aligned colons and spacing, and "Gateway_Payment" row is not formatted with spaces between id and old/new type as in the ground truth.
- Headings are not verbatim: the LLM answer includes preceding hyphens ("- ADDED TASKS") instead of just "ADDED TASKS" as required.
- All content differences are otherwise accurate—no missing or extra changes—but the formatting and heading issues are significant deductions per the strictness criterion.
