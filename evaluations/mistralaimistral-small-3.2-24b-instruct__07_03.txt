The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). However, it deviates from the required verbatim heading format by adding leading dashes (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS") and uses additional indentation for sub-items, which introduces minor formatting inconsistencies compared to the ground truth. The gateway entry for Gateway_Payment lacks the exact spacing alignment seen in the ground truth. Under strict evaluation, these small formatting errors warrant a deduction, but the core differences extracted are flawless.
