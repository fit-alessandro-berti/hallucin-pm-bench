**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary policy violations (critical failure, -4.0 deduction)**: Disallowed terms leak everywhere ("Preliminary Assessment", "Customer Due Diligence", "Sanctions Check"). Authorized terms appear but are tainted by parentheticals; policy is **STRICT**—no synonyms/alternatives even in explanations/parentheses.
- **Activities mismatch (major failure, -2.0 deduction)**: Adds 4 unauthorized activities ("Approval Decision", "Scheduling Payment", "Fund Release", "Notification"); renames/splits (e.g., no "Compliance Officer Approval"; invents sub-conditions). Must not rename/merge/add; ground truth has exactly 6 precise activities.
- **RACI assignments incorrect (major failure, -2.0 deduction)**: All rows mismatch (e.g., Intake Vetting: LLM "R/C/A/I" vs. ground truth "R,A/C/–/I"; Risk Scoring: LLM "R/R/A/I" vs. "C/R/A/I"). No "R,A" combos; no dashes (–); ignores escalation logic.
- **Format errors (failure, -1.0 deduction)**: No bolding; single letters only; extra columns/rows; no exact Markdown fidelity to ground truth.
- **Overall coverage**: Fails to "cover every activity and role described" using **only** authorized vocabulary. Zero alignment beyond superficial table structure. Utmost strictness applied—small errors (e.g., parentheticals) alone warrant major loss; cumulative errors = minimum score.
