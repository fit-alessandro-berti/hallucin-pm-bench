The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth content line-by-line with no hallucinations, missing elements, or fabrications: Q1/A1 is identical (3); Q2/A2 is identical in sequence and wording (minor escaping in ground truth is non-substantive); Q3/A3 correctly lists the two distinct activities alphabetically, one per line. Strict deductions applied for minor formatting divergences (e.g., no bullets or bolding as in ground truth; plain lines instead of "- " and <br>) and the unrequested "## Explanation" section, which adds extraneous content despite being accurate.
