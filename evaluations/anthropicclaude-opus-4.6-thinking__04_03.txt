**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect, correctly identifies "No" compliance with identical rule-by-rule assessments and reasonings as the ground truth (same satisfied/violated status for all 4 rules, same core violation in Rule 3 with matching explanation: NA before RA despite requiring both QE and RA). Justifications reference each rule explicitly. Stylistic differences (e.g., trace table for clarity, markdown headers, ✅/❌ icons instead of ✔/❌, paragraph summaries vs. table, minor wording/punctuation variations like "NOT compliant" vs. "not compliant") are present but do not alter meaning, brevity, or correctness; extra structure enhances readability without violating "short justification" (still concise overall). No errors, violations, or substantive deviations under strict evaluation.
