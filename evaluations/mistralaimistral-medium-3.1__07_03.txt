9.0

The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth, accurately identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the two gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel; Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel), with no extras, omissions, or commentary. However, under strict evaluation, it incurs deductions for minor formatting deviations: (1) unnecessary bolding of headings (**ADDED TASKS** vs. plain ADDED TASKS), (2) extraneous backticks around all task and gateway IDs (e.g., `Task_FraudCheck` vs. Task_FraudCheck; `Gateway_ReviewNeeded` vs. Gateway_ReviewNeeded), and (3) lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway line (Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel vs. Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel). These small inconsistencies with the prompt's verbatim and example formatting (no bold or backticks in output examples) result in a significant but not severe point loss from a perfect 10.0.
