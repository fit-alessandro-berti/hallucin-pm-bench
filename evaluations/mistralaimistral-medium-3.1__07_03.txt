9.0

The LLM answer is essentially correct and closely matches the ground truth. All added and removed tasks and gateway type changes are accurately identified, using the correct id and name formats, and nothing extraneous is included.

Minor issues:
- The headings are formatted with asterisks instead of the exact "all caps, no formatting" as in the ground truth, and the gateway change lines don’t have the spacing/alignment of the ground truth.
- It includes quote formatting around ids and names, whereas the ground truth omits quotes.
- There are minor differences in alignment and indentation ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" vs. the ground truth's "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"), which could be construed as attention to formatting details.

These are small, but per instructions, even small errors should cause a significant loss of points.

Therefore: 9.0
