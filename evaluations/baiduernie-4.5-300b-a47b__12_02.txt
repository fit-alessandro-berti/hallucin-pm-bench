9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It correctly states "No" and identifies both C003 (lines 6–7) and C005 (lines 11–12) as counterexamples, referencing relevant lines, which matches the gold-standard answer. The answer's justification is clear and accurate.

The main minor deviation is that the LLM adds a comment about "case C001 (lines 1-2) and C002 (lines 3-5), the sequence holds," which isn't present in the ground truth. This addition is unnecessary for falsifying the claim and slightly distracts from the task of only *justifying* the negative answer with counter-examples.

Otherwise, there are no inaccuracies or missed details. Thus, the score reflects a minor but real penalty for including slightly superfluous context.
