The LLM answer is highly accurate, directly answering "No" as required and providing a concise, one-paragraph justification that cites the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11) with no factual deviations from the ground truth. It faithfully captures the violations of the "always follows" claim, including the reversed order and absence of Receive_Order. The only minor deduction is for slight phrasing variations (e.g., "no preceding Receive_Order at all" vs. "never contains *Receive_Order* at all") and lack of bullet-point formatting, which under utmost strictness reflects a negligible but present stylistic difference.
