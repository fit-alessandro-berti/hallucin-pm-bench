The LLM answer is highly accurate and matches the ground truth in structure, content, and detail. It correctly answers "No" as required and provides two clear cases (C003 and C005) as counter-examples, citing both line numbers and case IDs. The explanations for why these cases violate the claim are logically sound and concise.

Only a tiny deduction (0.5 points) comes from minor differences in wording:
- The LLM uses "so it does not follow Receive_Order" for C005, which is slightly less explicit than the ground truthâ€™s "but never contains Receive_Order at all."
- The ground truth uses formatting (asterisks, bold) for activity names, which the LLM omits.

However, these differences are stylistic and do not alter the correctness or clarity of the response. The paragraph is a precise, step-wise justification that fully aligns with the task.
