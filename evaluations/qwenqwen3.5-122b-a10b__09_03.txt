The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in identifying the core issue (redacted event log data in Artefact A prevents computation), explicitly addressing all required metrics, and providing a precise, one-paragraph explanation without guessing or using external knowledge. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., elaborating on Artefact B's irrelevance, which is correct but absent in ground truth, and phrasing like "for this audit") and less punchy opener ("It is not possible" vs. "Impossible"), representing small stylistic differences under strict evaluation.
