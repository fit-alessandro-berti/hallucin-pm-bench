The LLM answer correctly identifies the two pairs of tasks that can execute in parallel but fails significantly on the required alphabetical ordering: within pairs (one pair is reversed: "Quality_Check — Create_Documentation" should be "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check") and overall list (pairs should start with "Create_Documentation" before "Procure_Materials"). Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., spacing) compound the issue. Under strict evaluation, these errors in structure and precision warrant a substantial deduction from a potential perfect score.
