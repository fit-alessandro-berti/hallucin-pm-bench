8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both pairs of parallel-executable tasks in Process B, and lists them in the correct format (one per line, using the required em dash) and in correct alphabetical order between the pairs.

However, within the pairs, the task order is not strictly alphabetical, as the instructions require:  
- For pair one, "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" should be "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" (which is correct).  
- For pair two, "Quality_Check — Create_Documentation" should be "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check", so the order within this pair is reversed relative to required alphabetical order.

This is a small but nontrivial formatting error, especially in a context where **strictness** and even **small errors** must result in a significant point deduction.  
Hence, the score is **8.0** instead of full credit.
