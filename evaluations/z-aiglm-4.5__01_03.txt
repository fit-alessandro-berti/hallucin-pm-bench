4.0

a) **Decision Points:**  
- The LLM incorrectly lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a decision point. The ground truth only considers the branch that comes immediately after the risk check (i.e., whether to skip Manual-Underwriting-Review based on specific criteria) and the TriVote decision gate.  
- The LLM describes the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as if it is a decision gate, but it is only an assessment, not a pass/fail or branch point.  
- The LLM does reasonably convey the conditional skip (though it could be crisper), and correctly describes the TriVote approval gate.

b) **Document List:**  
- The LLM omits the three scorecards (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow) from the requirements, despite them being explicit process inputs per the process description, and present in the ground truth answer.
- It does list “Signed Offer Sheet 77” and “ID Matrix Declaration” (good), and separates Signed Offer Sheet 77 from Offer Sheet 77 (correct).
- The “Deck Memo” is flagged as conditionally generated, which is true, but the question was to list all documents that are required anywhere in the process, not just universally/files created per loan.
- The document order otherwise matches.

**Penalties:**
- Major: omission of three essential documents that are explicit in the process.
- Significant: mischaracterization of the decision points by introducing an artificial decision (the risk assessment) and missing the crisper gate/branch structure demanded.
- Minor: “Note” clarifications provided (“only generated/reviewed if step 5 is not skipped”) are superfluous given prompt requirements, but do not introduce hallucination.

**Summary:**  
The LLM covered the two actual gates/branches, but with some extra fluff and slight imprecision. However, the omission of the three Scorecard documents from the required list is a major error. Therefore, a strict evaluation yields a score of **4.0**.
