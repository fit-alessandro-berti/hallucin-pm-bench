### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (40% weight, as it requires precise identification and one-sentence summaries of *every* gate/branch):** Ground truth identifies exactly two decision points: (1) the risk-based conditional skip/branch after Step 3, and (2) the TriVote approval gate in Step 6. The LLM incorrectly adds a third "decision point" for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself (Step 3), which is not a gate or branch but a preliminary step producing inputs for the actual branch in Step 4—this is a clear misidentification and hallucination of the process structure. The summaries for the skip (LLM point 2) and TriVote (LLM point 3) are mostly accurate but include unnecessary details (e.g., listing approvers prematurely) and fail to match the ground truth's concise, rule-focused phrasing (e.g., ground truth emphasizes "bypass" and "record 'Approve'"; LLM dilutes with "proceed to the offer stage"). Extra point and phrasing mismatches deduct heavily for inaccuracy and overreach. Partial credit for covering the two real points, but strictness demands near-perfect alignment: ~2.5/4.0.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents List (60% weight, as it requires exhaustive enumeration in first-appearance order):** Ground truth lists 9 documents, including the three scorecards as distinct inputs first appearing in Step 3 (before the conditional in Step 4). The LLM omits all three scorecards entirely—a critical hallucination/omission, as they are explicitly named "documents" in the process description and appear early. The LLM's list has only 6 items, placing Deck Memo (Step 5) too early (as #2, skipping scorecards) and including extraneous notes (e.g., about skipping or signing, which add no value and deviate from the simple ordered list format). It correctly identifies the rest (Form 14B first, then later documents including Signed Offer Sheet 77 as separate), but the major gap (missing 3/9 core items) and reordered/ incomplete sequence violate the "all documents... in the order they first appear" instruction. No hallucinations like KYC/AML, but incompleteness is a severe error under strict evaluation: ~1.5/6.0.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity:** The LLM's response is well-formatted but introduces extras (e.g., introductory sentence, notes) not in the ground truth, slightly bloating it. No policy violations or unrelated content, but deviations from the exact process description (e.g., implying Deck Memo is "generated/reviewed" conditionally, when ground truth treats it as required when applicable) compound issues. Total differences (extra/missing elements, order errors) are substantial, warranting a low score despite partial overlaps. Under utmost strictness, even minor phrasing/order slips cost points, amplifying the impact of omissions.
