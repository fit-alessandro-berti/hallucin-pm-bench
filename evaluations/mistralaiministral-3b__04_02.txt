2.5

Rationale:  
The LLM made significant mistakes, marking rules R2, R3, and R5 as **Compliant** when all three are **Violated** according to a detailed and correct analysis. It also gave incorrect justifications and provided an erroneous **COMPLIANT** overall result, when the case is clearly **NON-COMPLIANT**. Only R1, R4, and R6 were reasonably handled. The errors are severe and structural, reflecting a misunderstanding of key process dependencies and time sequencing. Minor formatting deviations are less relevant than the substantive logic errors.
