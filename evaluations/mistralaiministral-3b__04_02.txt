3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Correct status (Compliant) and justification aligns with ground truth (minor phrasing difference, but ≤20 words and accurate). Full points.
- **R2**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores post-change approval timing, misinterpreting "last required approval." Major error; significant deduction.
- **R3**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated); justification factually wrong on dates (Pay_Invoice precedes Receive_Goods). Clear factual error; heavy deduction.
- **R4**: Correct status (Not Applicable) and justification matches ground truth. Full points.
- **R5**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated); justification overlooks "before any further processing step" after Change_Request (e.g., Ship_Goods, Pay_Invoice precede new approval). Major interpretive error; significant deduction.
- **R6**: Correct status (Compliant) and justification aligns. Full points.
- **Overall Conclusion**: Incorrect (COMPLIANT vs. NON-COMPLIANT); fails to reflect violations in R2, R3, R5. Critical error; heaviest deduction.
- **Format/Justifications**: Adheres to ≤20 words and bold status format; minor bonus, but cannot offset substantive errors.
- **Strictness Applied**: Three rule violations missed (50% error rate), plus flawed conclusion, indicate fundamental misanalysis of trace chronology and rules. Score reflects partial accuracy (3/6 rules correct) but penalizes all differences harshly per instructions.
