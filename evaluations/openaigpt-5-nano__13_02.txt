10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches the ground truth exactly (1 occurrence). For question 2, both percentages are precisely calculated and rounded to two decimals as required (2.08% for events, 8.33% for cases). For question 3, the response is under 100 words (78 words), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue ("appears in only one..."), highlights variance/instability ("high variance and instability in performance estimates and predictive models"), and cautions against over-generalization ("risks overfitting... miscalibrating decisions when applied to broader... datasets"), aligning with the ground truth criteria without invention or deviation from the log. No errors or omissions.
