The LLM answer is nearly perfect on questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth exactly in counts and percentages (no deductions). For question 3, it adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, mentions the single occurrence/low support (i), implies instability through insufficient data leading to bias and poor model performance (ii, though less explicit on variance/noise/skewing than the sample, warranting a minor deduction), and cautions against over-generalization by highlighting risks in predictive/performance analyses (iii). Overall, strong alignment with a slight focus shift from pure statistical unreliability, but no invention of data.
