The LLM answer is nearly perfectâ€”it provides:

- The correct "No" verdict.
- Explicit enumeration of all relevant case IDs (C001, C002, C003, C004), showing their activity sequences.
- Clear identification of the cases where the order is immediate and where an activity intervenes.
- A summary sentence that the FACT is incorrect and supporting evidence.

Minor deduction (0.2 points):  
It does not present the justification in a tabular form or with the precise column headers and "Immediate successor?" column, as in the ground truth, and is slightly less systematic (e.g., "immediate" vs. "Immediate successor?"). There is also a small reduction in clarity in the summary reasoning; the ground truth is slightly more rigorous in explicitly noting that 2 out of 4 cases violate the claim.

Otherwise, all substantive aspects are correctly addressed.
