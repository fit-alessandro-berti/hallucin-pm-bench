The LLM answer is fully accurate, with no factual errors, omissions, or deviations from the ground truth. It correctly identifies "No" as the answer and provides a precise case-by-case justification mirroring the ground truth's analysis (immediate successors for each case, highlighting violations in C002 and C004 due to intervening activities). The only minor difference is structural (bullets vs. table), which does not impact content accuracy or completeness.
