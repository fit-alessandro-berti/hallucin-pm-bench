3.5

### Evaluation Notes (for transparency, not part of the scored response):
- **Diff Format (Major Error, -4 points)**: The LLM's diff is malformedâ€”not a proper unified diff hunk. It lacks `@@` context lines, `-` (original) and `+` (modified) prefixes, and only shows a single incomplete line without indicating removal/addition. This violates the "unified diff (single hunk)" requirement strictly.
- **Content Accuracy (-2.0 points)**: Targets the correct task (`Task_CollectEquipment`) and attribute (`camunda:dueDate`), which is a partial match. However, changes to "P3D" (3 days) instead of ground truth "P2D" (2 days), which is incorrect and likely insufficient for the implied 3-day SLA (cumulative due dates exceed otherwise).
- **Rationale (-0.5 points)**: Concise and one sentence, but inaccurate (references 5-to-3 days vs. 5-to-2), omits key ground truth elements like the "3-day SLA" and "without introducing new activities," and uses vague phrasing ("meet SLA targets") instead of precise SLA reference.
- **Overall Adherence**: Follows "exactly one improvement" and modifies an existing attribute without adding/deleting elements, but errors in execution make it non-compliant. Strict scoring penalizes all deviations heavily; base ~7 for partial correctness, minus deductions for precision/format failures.
