The LLM’s answer correctly identifies the appropriate user task to modify ("Collect Equipment") and proposes a reduction in due-date to improve SLA compliance, which matches the intent of the ground truth.

However, the proposed change sets <code>camunda:dueDate="P3D"</code> rather than the required <code>"P2D"</code> specified in the ground truth. This 1-day discrepancy is significant in the context of tight SLA requirements and should result in a substantial penalty.

Additionally, the diff output is not unified (it omits proper unified diff headers and context), though this is a minor formatting issue compared to the semantic error.

The rationale is reasonably aligned, but lacks mention of the 3-day SLA boundary specifically noted in the ground truth.

Therefore, strict grading:  
- Correct task and attribute: +4  
- Incorrect due date value: −3  
- Slightly vague/mismatching rationale and format: −1  

**Total: 6.0**
