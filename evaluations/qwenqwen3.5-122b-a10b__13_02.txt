**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match:  
- Q1: Exact ("1").  
- Q2a: Exact ("2.08%", with calculation; minor formatting diff—space before %—ignored as non-substantive).  
- Q2b: Exact ("8.33%", with calculation).  
- Q3: 78 words (≤100); covers (i) single occurrence, (ii) instability (outliers skew metrics/models), (iii) over-generalization risk (ignores variants, poor decisions); directly from log/data. No inventions, fully deterministic where applicable.
