**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct in content (3 distinct cases identified accurately with matching list; correct predecessor "Pack_Items" for C456's "Ship_Order"; correct unique activity "Cancel_Order") and adheres to the prompt's instruction for concise bullet-point answers. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "Distinct cases: **3**" vs. "**A1:** 3 cases"; descriptive bullet labels vs. "A1/A2/A3") do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they preserve exact semantics, completeness, and format intent with no factual deviations, omissions, or inaccuracies.
