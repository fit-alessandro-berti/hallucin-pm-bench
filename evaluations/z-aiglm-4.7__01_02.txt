### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (high alignment ~85-90% base)**: Correctly identifies the exact 3 decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)) with precise conditions, terminology, and flow logic matching the process. Required documents list is **complete and verbatim** from the prompt (6 items, exact phrasing like "(CIS) template", "(single pay-stub or tax slip)", "(≤ 3 months old)"), superior to ground truth's shortenings/omissions.
- **Errors/Differences (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  1. **Omission of flow positions** (medium errors, -1.0 total): Misses "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for #1 and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for #2 – critical for process flow emphasized in prompt/system (utmost strictness demands exact contextual placement).
  2. **Structure/format variances** (small errors x3, -0.4 total): Bulleted/sub-bulleted vs ground truth's "####" headers + concise numbered lines with "⇒"; verbose descriptions vs tight "*If...*"; bullets vs numbered docs list.
  3. **Phrasing/capitalization** (small errors x2, -0.3 total): "*approve* or *reject*" (italics/lowercase) vs "**Approve** or **Reject**" (bold/caps); "Proceed to" vs "send to"; extra "(only occurs if amount ≥ €15 000)" not in ground truth.
  4. **Missing elements** (small, -0.1): No "(complete list)", no extra note "*(No credit bureau...)*".
- **Overall**: Core content faithful (no inventions, exact names), but flow omissions and stylistic diffs prevent 9+ under "utmost strictness/small errors = significant loss". Not 10.0 (imperfect match); not <8 (substance intact).
