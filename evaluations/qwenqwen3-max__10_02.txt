1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key failures include: (1) Missing the "Operations Manager" column, which is present in the ground truth and alters the entire RACI structure; (2) Incorrect and incomplete task mappingsâ€”e.g., adding extraneous tasks like "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison upon case archiving" as separate rows, while omitting precise phrasing like "Receive Payment Instruction" or "Archive Record," and not bolding key mandated terms like "**KYC Review**"; (3) Vastly divergent RACI assignments across nearly every cell (e.g., ground truth assigns "A" to Operations Manager for most tasks, with mixed C/I for others, but LLM simplifies to single roles without consultation/informed elements); (4) Lack of the ground truth's legend and explanatory notes on mandated wording; (5) Overall failure to mirror the ground truth's exact structure, terminology emphasis, and comprehensive coverage without additions or omissions. Even minor vocabulary adherence (e.g., using "KYC Review") cannot offset these systemic mismatches, resulting in zero fidelity to the reference.
