4.5

**Evaluation:**

Strictly applying the grading instructions and scrutinizing all errors:

**Positives:**
- Mandated vocabulary (“KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”) correctly used for people and activity roles.
- Organized in markdown and RACI format.
- Tasks are reasonably mapped to process steps.

**Major Issues and Errors:**

1. **Role omission**: The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" (as 'Accountable' for nearly every process), which is clearly present in the ground truth answer. This is a significant loss in fidelity.
2. **Inaccurate RACI assignments**:
    - "Accountable" role is only assigned to "Regulatory Liaison" for high-risk approvals; it should be "Operations Manager" in nearly all tasks.
    - Several "Consulted" and "Informed" fields omitted entirely or misapplied, especially to IT Support and Regulatory Liaison. The ground truth has these consistently.
    - For “Archive case file,” correct marking should be "R" for IT Support but also “A” for Operations and various I/C for others.
3. **Task wording inconsistencies**:
    - Tasks are written more informally (“Receive and log...”) instead of the mandated process jargon/naming conventions (“Receive Payment Instruction”, “Screen Against Sanctions List”, etc.).
    - “KYC Review” is used in the correct place, but not consistently as a *task name* as in the ground truth.
    - “Notify Regulatory Liaison upon case archiving” is not explicitly present in the source—ground truth instead uses RACI to show who is “Informed.”
4. **Structural/format issues**:
    - No RACI legend provided.
    - Not a one-to-one match between the ground truth table and LLM output.
    - Source-to-task mapping is sometimes incomplete (e.g., the release of payment is not clearly mapped to RACI responsibilities for all roles).
5. **SWIFT message**: IT Support as "Responsible" is correct, but the lack of C/I/A for other roles is a deviation from the ground truth.

**Summary of point loss:**
-2 points for omitting key roles (Operations Manager).
-1.5 points RACI errors (Accountable and Consulted/Informed misapplied across most tasks).
-1 points for lack of task naming conformity.
-0.5 point for missing legend/format issues.
-0.5 point for minor mapping and consistency errors.

**Result:**  
The answer is functionally close on vocabulary and high-level process, but serious omissions and terminology issues mean a **strict** evaluation must be well below passing.  

**Final score: 4.5**
