The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Roles**: Omits "Operations Manager" entirely (a core column in ground truth) and limits to only three roles, violating the need to match the ground truth structure. This is a fundamental mismatch.
- **Tasks**: Introduces extra tasks (e.g., separate "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison upon case file archival") not present in ground truth; alters wording (e.g., "Receive customerâ€™s transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen the payment against the sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record"); omits specificity like "on both sender and beneficiary" in KYC Review while ground truth simplifies but aligns differently. Task count and granularity do not match (LLM has 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6).
- **Assignments (R/A/C/I)**: Completely divergent for nearly every task. Examples: "Receive" is solely R for Transaction Analyst in LLM vs. R/A/C/I across multiple roles in ground truth; "KYC Review" is solely R for Regulatory Liaison vs. C/R/A/I distribution; "Approve" is solely A vs. C/R/A/I; no task in LLM uses "C" (Consulted), despite including it in the key, which is an internal inconsistency and mismatch to ground truth's frequent use of C.
- **Formatting and Additional Elements**: Lacks ground truth's header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), bolding on tasks/assignments, and precise legend placement. Adds an explanatory note absent in ground truth, altering the output structure.
- **Vocabulary Fidelity**: While LLM correctly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"), this minor alignment does not offset the pervasive structural and content differences, as even small variances (e.g., task phrasing, missing role) demand significant point deductions.

Overall, the LLM answer fails to replicate the ground truth's exact mapping, roles, tasks, and assignments, resulting in near-total divergence.
