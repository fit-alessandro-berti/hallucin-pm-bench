The LLM answer correctly identifies that the calculation of the required metrics is impossible due to the complete redaction of necessary data (event rows and timestamps) in Artefact A. It also precisely describes what information is missing and why this prohibits calculation, and it avoids guessing or using outside information.

However, there is some unnecessary verbosity and slight repetition in its explanation (e.g., reiterating what is missing both in numbered and paragraph form), whereas the ground truth provides a more concise and direct statement of impossibility.

This small lack of conciseness and over-explanation, while not factually incorrect, detracts from absolute precision and clarity demanded by the audit context. Therefore, a 1-point deduction is applied.
