The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth by correctly identifying the impossibility due to redacted rows and timestamps in Artefact A, emphasizing the absence of start/complete times needed for "Approve Invoice" durations. It precisely explains the data requirements without guessing or using external knowledge, as instructed. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (two paragraphs instead of one short paragraph) and not explicitly stating the need for "additional raw log entries," though these do not alter the core correctness.
