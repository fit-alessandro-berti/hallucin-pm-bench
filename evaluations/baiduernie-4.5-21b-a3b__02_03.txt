The LLM answer is correct in content, accurately addressing all questions with precise details matching the ground truth (distinct cases, preceding activity for C456, and unique activity). Minor differences in formatting and phrasing (e.g., added explanatory words in Q2) do not introduce errors or deviate from the required conciseness, maintaining fidelity to the prompt's intent.
