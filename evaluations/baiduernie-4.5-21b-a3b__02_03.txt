9.0

- The LLM Answer is very close to the ground truth.
- All substantive content is correct:
  - 1: Correctly identifies there are 3 cases and lists them.
  - 2: Correctly identifies "Pack_Items" as the immediate predecessor to "Ship_Order" for case "C456".
  - 3: Correctly identifies "Cancel_Order" as appearing exactly once.
- However, the answer format is somewhat wordier than "concise, bullet-point answers only," per the instructions, and it includes an extra colon and quotes for the activities, which the ground truth does not. The ground truth uses either "Pack_Items" or Pack\_Items, etc., but does not include quotation marks or "For case ...:".
- Strictly interpreted, even slightly wordier formatting (like the "For case..." phrase or use of quotes) should lead to a penalty, as per "utmost strictness."

Therefore, a 9.0: factually perfect, but not formatted with maximal conciseness or fidelity to the ground truth answer.
