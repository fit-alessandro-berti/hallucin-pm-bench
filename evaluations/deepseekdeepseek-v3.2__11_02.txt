**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), matching ground truth. Explanations cite table metrics strictly (e.g., 150 min wait, 22% rework, 12.4% SLA, 9 min stdev, 18 min wait, 3.2% SLA). Memo format is executive-style, concise (~120 words <200 limit). No hallucinations or absent activities.
- **Major Deductions (-2.8 total)**:
  - **Misses key data for worst-performer rationale**: Ignores throughput drop (280→190 at Request_Documents), a primary bottleneck indicator highlighted in ground truth. Relies only on wait/rework, under-explaining "why" per strict table basis (-1.0).
  - **Recommendations lack concreteness/data-driven precision** (-1.5): 
    | Activity | LLM Action | Issues vs. Ground Truth |
    |----------|------------|-------------------------|
    | Request_Documents | "Analyze rework causes (e.g., unclear requests)" | Diagnostic, not concrete action; speculative "e.g."; no metrics/targets (GT: specific digital tool to "halve rework"). |
    | Review_Documents | "Standardize checklists + training" | Vague; no tie to variability/SLA metrics (GT: AI + squad for time/variability trim). |
    | Initial_Assessment | "Adjust allocation *or* queue management" | Vague alternatives, no data link (GT: triage engine for low-risk auto-route, cuts wait/process). |
  - **No holistic impact/projection**: Ground truth projects +10% throughput/-40% breaches; LLM generic "improve flow" (-0.3).
- **Minor Deductions (-0.0 additional)**: Format/header extras ok (not required); "25±9" notation creative but accurate.
- **Overall**: Good alignment on ID/explanation (80% match), but significant gaps in data depth/actions justify strict 7.2 (not 10; differences > minor).
