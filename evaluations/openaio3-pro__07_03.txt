7.0

While the LLM answer correctly identifies all the functional changes and lists every required item, it considerably deviates from the required formatting prescribed in the instructions and demonstrated in the ground truth. Notable issues:

- The answer omits the dash "-" at the beginning of every item, against both prompt and ground truth requirements.
- For gateways, it does not include the spaces after the colon or align names as in the ground truth.
- For tasks, it omits the dash and does not quote the task id as shown in the ground truth.

These are significant conformance issues for a change analyst, even if all content is factually correct. Subtracting 3 points for these presentational and strict-format adherence errors: 7.0.
