The LLM answer accurately identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the two gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment, both exclusive â†’ parallel), matching the ground truth content verbatim. No extra or missing changes are included, and no commentary is added, adhering to the prompt's restrictions.

However, under strict evaluation, the formatting differs: the LLM omits bullet points ("- ") for all listed items, uses plain line breaks without them, and has minor inconsistencies in spacing/newlines after headings (e.g., double newline after "ADDED TASKS" vs. single in ground truth). Additionally, the ground truth aligns the second gateway entry with extra spaces after the colon for visual consistency, which the LLM uses single spaces for. These small presentational deviations, repeated across multiple lines, warrant a deduction despite perfect substantive accuracy.
