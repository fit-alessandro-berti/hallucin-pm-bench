7.0

**Rationale:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies the main decision points:
    - Eligibility by Triage Agent.
    - Pre-approval by Finance Controller.
    - High-value claim threshold (€1,000).
    - Senior Auditor review (for high-value).
    - Payment execution.
- It does not add forbidden activities or artefacts (no mention of legacy steps).
- All major artefacts used as required documents are correctly named and attributed.

**Issues (Significant Errors):**
1. **Decision Point Structure**:
    - The LLM answer lists "Process_Refund_Payment" as a decision point. According to the ground truth, the actual (explicit) decision is the combined approval(s) prior to payment, rather than payment as a decision event itself.
    - The "High-Value Refund Threshold Check" is not an activity, but a branching logic, but is listed as a standalone decision point. This can be accepted for clarity, but is less precise than the ground truth's tabular format.
    - The LLM answer splits financial decisions into more distinct points than ground truth: "Finance_Controller_PreApprove", "Senior_Auditor_Review", and "Process_Refund_Payment", when ground truth merges payment approvals under one final point.
2. **Document List**:
    - The LLM answer does **not** explicitly provide a full, consolidated list of required documents as requested; instead, documents are dispersed below individual steps and there is no total summary.
    - It omits **RefundConfirmationPDF** in its document lists, despite ground truth clearly requiring it.
    - For the threshold check, it correctly notes "none" required—but could clarify that this check’s dependency is the refund amount from the request.
3. **Small Details (strictness required):**
    - The answer does not clarify that AuditTrail is required *only* for claims above €1,000.
    - The combination of approvals for high-value payments (Finance_Controller + Senior_Auditor) is not fully explained at the payment stage.
    - Branching logic/outcomes are less clear and not described (as done in the ground truth's rightmost column).

**Conclusion:**  
- The answer is mostly accurate but loses significant points for:
    - Not producing a consolidated, complete document list.
    - Missing an explicit mention of RefundConfirmationPDF.
    - Less precise structure and branching explanations compared to ground truth.
    - Slight confusion/repetition in decision points (especially around payment execution).
- These errors are meaningful and, under strict evaluation, justify docking 3 points: the answer is factually solid but not strictly or exhaustively compliant.
