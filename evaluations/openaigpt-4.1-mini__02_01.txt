5.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on Q1, Q2, and Q3 (no differences, full credit per question). However, Q4 has a small but clear error (3 instead of 2, miscounting "Quality_Check" occurrences—only two events match: B-1045 at 08:45 and C-77 at 10:00), warranting a significant deduction under strict evaluation. Q5 has an incorrect list with an extra invalid entry ("Quality_Check", which does appear as the first event in case C-77), making the entire response for Q5 non-matching and invalid—another full deduction. With two erroneous questions out of five, equal weighting yields a strict overall score of 5.0 (equivalent to ~60% accuracy, adjusted downward for the policy on small errors).
