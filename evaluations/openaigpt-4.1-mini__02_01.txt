7.0

The LLM answer is nearly entirely correct, with a significant but singular error:

- **Q1:** Correct (3)
- **Q2:** Correct ("Pack_Items")
- **Q3:** Correct ("2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00")
- **Q4:** Incorrect: Answer is 3, but ground truth is 2.
    - The LLM includes three occurrences of "Quality_Check", but only two exist in the data.
    - This is a clear factual mistake and constitutes a major error.
- **Q5:** Incorrect: LLM lists ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Quality_Check", "Ship_Order"], ground truth is ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]
    - The LLM incorrectly includes "Quality_Check", which does appear as the first event in case C-77.

Both Q4 and Q5 contain factual errors based directly on reading/understanding the fragmentâ€”not subtle issues but direct mistakes. Each accounts for a significant deduction. All other answers are perfect. A reasonable strict score for an answer with accurate structure and two substantive fact errors is 7.0.
