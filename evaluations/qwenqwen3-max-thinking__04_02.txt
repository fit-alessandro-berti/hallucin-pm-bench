**5.0**

The LLM answer is mostly correct in format, with proper bolding, ≤20-word justifications, and correct overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion. Statuses match on R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 (5/6 correct). Justifications are similar or adequate on those rules.

Major deduction for R2: incorrectly **Compliant** (wrong status and justification, ignoring Change_Request's impact requiring new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07 as the last required approval; Ship_Goods on 03-05 is before it, violating "within 2 calendar days **after**"). This misses a key rule interaction/violation, a critical error under strict evaluation. R5 justification omits Pay_Invoice but still valid. Significant point loss for factual inaccuracy on compliance analysis.
