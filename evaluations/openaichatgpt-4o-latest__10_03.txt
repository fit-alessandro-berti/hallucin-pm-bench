2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (major deduction: -3.0)**: Correctly uses the four authorized terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. However, the prompt mandates "using only the authorized vocabulary," and the added activities (Escalation Review, Payment Scheduling, Funds Release, Originator Notification) introduce unauthorized terms not aligned with the ground truth's naming (e.g., "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"). This violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities" by splitting/merging narrative elements incorrectly (e.g., separate scheduling/release vs. ground truth's single "Release Funds"; no distinct notification row in ground truth).
  
- **Activity Coverage and Structure (major deduction: -2.5)**: Covers "every activity" but adds 4 unauthorized/extra rows (8 total vs. ground truth's 6), renaming/escalating non-core activities imprecisely (e.g., "Escalation Review" ≠ "Compliance Officer Approval"; omits notification as a standalone, yet ground truth implies it within "Release Funds" via "I"). Markdown table is present, but lacks ground truth's bolding on **Activity** headers and **R,A** cells. Uses blank cells instead of "–" for no involvement. Extra introductory text ("Sure. Below is...") and legend violate "Return the matrix as a Markdown table" (ground truth is pure table).

- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -1.5)**: Many inaccuracies/misses:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Only Front-Office R (partial); misses R,A designation, Compliance C, Treasury I.
  - **KYC Review/AML Screening**: Only Compliance R each (partial); misses R,A, Officer C, Treasury I.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Only Compliance R; misses Officer A, Front-Office C, Treasury I.
  - **Escalation Review** (mismatched to ground truth's Approval): Front-Office blank (should be I); Compliance C (ok); Officer A/R (matches R,A); Treasury I (wrong, ground truth –).
  - **Payment Scheduling/Funds Release** (ungrounded splits): Treasury A/R only; misses ground truth's C/I for others in merged "Release Funds."
  - **Originator Notification** (added, not in ground truth): Front-Office R and Treasury I reversed (Treasury should be R for notifying; Front-Office I).
  Overall, ~60% of cells diverge (incomplete, wrong, or absent), ignoring narrative nuances (e.g., Officer accountability for scoring/escalation; broad "I" for informeds).

- **Fidelity to Narrative/Roles (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Covers all roles but blanks imply no involvement incorrectly (e.g., no Front-Office in escalation). "Originating analyst" assumed as Front-Office but assigned wrongly.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 2.5 for cumulative strict violations—core terms saved minor credit, but additions, incompletes, and mismatches dominate as "small errors" compound significantly.
