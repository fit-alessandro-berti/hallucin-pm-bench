2.5

The LLM answer suffers from several critical issues compared to the ground truth and the instructions provided:

**Strict Vocabulary Usage**
- The matrix correctly uses only the authorized terms for activities ("Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," "Risk Scoring")—no unauthorized synonyms are present. This is done well.

**Activity Naming & Structure**
- The LLM invents/unmerges new activities: "Escalation Review," "Payment Scheduling," "Funds Release," and "Originator Notification," which are not present in the ground truth nor in the list of authorized activity names. This is a serious breach of instructions ("do not rename, merge, or add activities").
- The ground truth correctly limits itself to six activities, all matching those derived from the process using authorized terminology.
- The LLM omits "Compliance Officer Approval" (ground truth) and instead uses "Escalation Review," which is a major error.

**Roles and Assignment Errors**
- The LLM answer fails to consistently assign both R and A, rarely combining them (ground truth often assigns both to the same role).
- For most activities, "Accountable" (A) is either missing or ambiguously placed. In the ground truth, every activity has one clear A.
- Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments are sparse and sometimes missing compared to the richer, more collaborative assignment in the ground truth.
- The LLM includes extra roles that are not involved in certain activities, violating the "no involvement" marker (should use a dash), and also doesn’t use the dash notation to indicate absence of involvement as per the ground truth.

**Other Format and Accuracy Points**
- The LLM provides a legend, which is fine, but it does not explain the "R, A" combination or use this format, as mandated.
- The response does not clearly stick to the concise format of the ground truth.
- The ground truth always marks every activity and role (even with a dash for none), which the LLM does not.

**Summary**
- Using the correct vocabulary for four core activities is almost the only thing the LLM answer does right.
- Major deduction: Extra/renamed activities, incorrect R/A/C/I assignments, non-compliance with format and notation, omissions of roles, and non-compliance with strict process instructions.

**Justification for score (2.5):**
- Minor credit for strict vocabulary use, but massive errors in terms of activity/role coverage, matrix structure, and notation, with multiple departures from the ground truth and instructions.
