**8.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **A1 (Distinct cases)**: Content accurate (3 cases listed correctly), but minor differences: missing explicit "cases" word, label "**Distinct cases:**" vs ground truth "**A1:**". Deduct 0.3.
- **A2 (Preceding activity)**: Core answer correct ("Pack_Items"), but significant differences: verbose label "**Preceding activity for C456 → Ship_Order:**" vs "**A2:**", unnecessary extra "(at 09:35:00)" (not in ground truth or prompt), italics formatting vs plain escaped "\_". Less concise. Deduct 1.0.
- **A3 (Activity once)**: Accurate ("Cancel_Order"), minor formatting difference (italics "*" vs escaped "\_"). Deduct 0.2.
- **Overall**: Bullet-point format matches prompt request, content 100% correct (verified: 3 cases; C456 sequence Create→Validate→Pack→Ship; Cancel once). High marks for accuracy, but strict deductions for non-identical phrasing, extra info, and label/format variances = 8.5 total.
