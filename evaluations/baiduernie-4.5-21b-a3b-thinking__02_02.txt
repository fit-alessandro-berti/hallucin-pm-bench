9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1 (Distinct cases: 3)**: Core answer is exactly correct (3). Minor deduction for unnecessary enumeration of cases (C001, C002, C003), which adds extra detail not in ground truth. This is a small extraneous element under strict criteria.
- **Q2 (Sequence for C002)**: Core sequence matches ground truth exactly (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order). Significant deduction for extraneous details (line numbers, timestamps, and descriptive text), treated as extra elements per evaluation guidelines, introducing verbosity not present in the minimal ground truth.
- **Q3 (Preceding activities)**: Core list matches ground truth exactly in content and alphabetical order (Arrange_Delivery; Check_Stock), presented one per line. Moderate deduction for extraneous per-case explanations, which add unrequested analysis despite being factually accurate.

Overall, the answer is factually precise with no missing, incorrect, or fabricated elements, but loses points strictly for extras (1.0 total deduction) that deviate from the ground truth's concise format. Under utmost strictness, this reflects minor bloat as penalized hallucinations of detail.
