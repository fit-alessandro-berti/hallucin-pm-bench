7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Structural and Semantic Differences (Major Deductions -4.0 total):**
- **Extra task and flows**: LLM includes an explicit `wrc_CheckEligibility` task ("checks warranty eligibility") between the completeness gateway ("yes") and warranty gateway, adding 1 task and 2 sequence flows (total 8 tasks/16 flows vs GT's 7 tasks/15 flows). Ground truth omits this task, connecting completeness gateway "Yes" directly to warranty gateway. This alters the process sequence, making it non-equivalent despite prompt mentioning the check (LLM not hallucinated per prompt, but differs from GT structure; strict rubric deducts for extra elements relative to reference).
- Parallel gateways named ("Parallel Split"/"Parallel Join") vs unnamed in GT (-0.3).

**Element Naming and Verbatim Mismatches (Significant Deductions -1.5 total):**
- Start event name="Start" vs GT "Online warranty claim submitted" (-0.4; generic vs descriptive per process start).
- End events "Reject"/"Complete" vs "Rejected"/"Successful end" (-0.3).
- Gateway names casing/punctuation: "Claim Complete?" vs "Claim complete?"; "Within Warranty?" vs "Within warranty?" (-0.3).
- Task names closer to verbatim lowercase (e.g., "validates the claim" matches prompt text better than GT's title-case "Validate the claim"), but still minor casing diffs in some (-0.2).
- Flow labels: LLM uses `<conditionExpression>` (CDATA "true"/"false"); GT uses `name="Yes"/"No"` on flows. Different modeling (-0.3).

**XML Syntax and Style Differences (Moderate Deductions -1.0 total):**
- No `bpmn:` prefix/namespace vs GT's prefixed `<bpmn:definitions>` etc. (-0.3; both valid BPMN 2.0 but structurally divergent).
- IDs inconsistent: camelCase (e.g., "wrc_ValidateClaim") vs snake/lower (e.g., "wrc_validate"); "wrc_Flow_N" vs "wrc_sfN" (-0.2).
- Task types: `userTask` (most), `sendTask` (rejection) vs all generic `task` (-0.3; more specific but not matching GT/prompt-generic).
- Extra comments, different `targetNamespace`, longer format (-0.2).

**Strengths (No Deduction/Partial Credit):**
- All prompt-required gateways (2 exclusive, parallel pair), exactly 2 ends, wrc_ ID prefix, loop for incomplete claim, parallel branches correct.
- No omissions of prompt elements; covers all explicit activities.
- Self-contained valid BPMN 2.0 XML.

Base 10.0 → deductions yield 7.2. Semantically close (~85% match) but strict per instructions: extra elements, flow diffs, and syntactic variances = significant loss (not "equivalent" like ID/whitespace changes).
