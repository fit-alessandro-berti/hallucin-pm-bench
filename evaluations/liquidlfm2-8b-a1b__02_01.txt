The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on Q1, Q3, and Q4 (3 out of 5 questions correct), earning partial credit. However, Q2 has a major factual error ("Validate_Order" instead of "Pack_Items," misidentifying the immediate predecessor in case A-9321), and Q5 is entirely incorrect (lists only "Quality_Check," which actually does appear as a first event in case C-77, while omitting the actual activities that never start cases: "Validate_Order," "Pack_Items," and "Ship_Order"). Under strict evaluation, these significant deviations (affecting sequence analysis and completeness) result in substantial point loss, as even minor inaccuracies in process-mining log interpretation must be penalized heavily.
