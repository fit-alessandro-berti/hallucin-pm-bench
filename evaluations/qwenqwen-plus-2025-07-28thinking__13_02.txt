The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and rounding. For question 3, it adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue (one event/case), notes variance/instability (skewed metrics, overfitting from outliers), and cautions against over-generalization (misrepresents behavior, distorts patterns when scaled), fulfilling all criteria without invention or deviation from the log.
