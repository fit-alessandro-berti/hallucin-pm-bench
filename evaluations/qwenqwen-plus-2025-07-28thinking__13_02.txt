**9.5**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect:

1. **Question 1 (Count):** Correctly reports "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time (in C05) — matches the ground truth.
2. **Question 2a (Events %):** Calculates 1/48 = 0.020833..., rounded to 2.08%. Presented and rounded correctly.
3. **Question 2b (Cases %):** Calculates 1/12 = 0.083333..., rounded to 8.33%. Also correct.
4. **Question 3 (Explanation):** 
   - Raises the key issue: only one case/event means no statistical reliability.
   - Notes that performance metrics and predictive models become unreliable/outlier-prone, which covers instability/variance and over-generalisation.
   - Specifically cautions against generalising from this small sample.
   - Stays within the word limit and does not add invented information.

**Deduction (−0.5):** The only minor shortcoming is that the answer could slightly more directly mention "variance/instability" or "wide confidence intervals" as in the ground truth, but "skewed by single outliers" and "lacks statistical reliability" is sufficient for strict grading. Still, because the ground-truth asks for mention of variance/instability with a bit more explicitness, −0.5 is deducted for utmost strictness.

Otherwise, all dimensions are correct and precise.
