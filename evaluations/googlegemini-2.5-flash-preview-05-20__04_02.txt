8.0

- The LLM answer is mostly correct, closely matching the ground truth in most rule assessments, final status statements, and demonstrates careful attention to sequence and timing.
- R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6 evaluations are all consistent with the ground truth in both status and justification. 
- The justification for R5 is accurate, and Pay_Invoice’s sequencing is also correctly assessed.
- The overall conclusion of NON-COMPLIANT is correct.

**Reason for point deduction:**
- R2 is marked **Compliant** in the LLM answer, but the ground truth (and correct logic) is **Violated** because Ship_Goods occurred before the required post-change Manager Approval, and more than 2 days after the correct "final required approval" (which, per the rule and change, is the new Manager Approval). The LLM shows some indecision and offers an incorrect justification. This is a significant error as it is a central compliance breach.
- The justification for R2 is longer than 20 words due to the internal reasoning, and the LLM offers a confusing "re-evaluation" instead of the required concise justification, straying from answer requirements.
- Minor formatting and style differences (adding unnecessary explanations) go against "≤ 20-word justification".

**Summary:** One significant assessment mistake (R2) plus exceeding the word limit and a less concise presentation, though overall comprehensively reasoned.
