**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks (major errors, -3.0 pts)**: Lists only 2/3 correctly (misses **Final Reject** / `Task_FinalReject`). No names, just IDs; ground truth uses both name + ID in numbered list.
- **Removed tasks (critical error, -3.0 pts)**: Incorrectly states "None" (misses **Reject Loan** / `Task_RejectLoan`, the only removal). Ground truth identifies it precisely.
- **Gateway-type changes (partial credit, -0.8 pts)**: Captures core Exclusive → Inclusive but omits ID (`Gateway_Decision`), XOR/OR details, and exact phrasing. Extra "(replaced, no removal)" is irrelevant noise.
- **Format & structure (-1.0 pts)**: Uses ### headings and bullets inconsistently; polluted by ~400 words of leaked internal reasoning/monologue (e.g., "Wait:", repeated rephrasing), violating "summarise *all* changes, grouped under *exactly* these headings" → not a clean, professional summary.
- **Overall strictness**: 60% content accuracy (2/3 added + 0/1 removed + ~70% gateway), but misses/incompleteness + pollution = low score. No credit for ignoring cosmetics (didn't err there). Ground truth is precise/complete.
