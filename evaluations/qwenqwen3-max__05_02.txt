7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the right user task (Task_CollectEquipment) to target for the SLA improvement, and the unified diff is correctly formatted and limited to a single hunk, only modifying an attribute as per instructions.

However, instead of reducing the due date to P2D, as in the ground truth, it reduces it further to P1D. This is a significant deviation: while a tighter SLA (P1D) may be technically valid, the specific improvement requested was P2Dâ€”likely chosen to be the minimal change required to bring the process into compliance. The LLM's proposal is thus unnecessarily strict, possibly imposing avoidable burden.

The rationale is concise and clear but omits reference to the specific SLA target (3-day cycle) and does not justify why P1D is chosen rather than the minimal change required.

Summary of errors:
- Due date is reduced too far (P1D vs. P2D).
- Rationale is valid but lacks explicit alignment with SLA details.

Given the nature of the instructions to penalize even small deviations, this answer merits a 7.0.
