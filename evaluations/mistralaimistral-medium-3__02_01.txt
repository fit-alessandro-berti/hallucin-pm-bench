8.0

The LLM answer is nearly perfect except for Q5, where it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as never being a first event of any case. In the event log, "Quality_Check" is in fact the first event for case C-77, so its inclusion is a clear error. All other answers exactly match the ground truth, but this mistake on Q5 is significant and should be penalized, resulting in a score reduction. Thus, 8.0 reflects a strict but fair assessment.
