The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for Q1â€“Q4 (no differences, full credit there). However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as an activity that never appears as the first event, despite it being the first event in case C-77; the correct list should exclude it entirely. This is a clear factual error in analysis of the log, resulting in an inaccurate and incomplete list (extra invalid entry), warranting a significant deduction despite the overall structure and most content being correct. Under strict evaluation, this reduces the score from a potential 10.
