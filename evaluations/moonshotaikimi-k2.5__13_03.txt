The LLM answer matches perfectly on Q1 (exact count: 1). For Q2, it correctly identifies small sample size (3 cases/~1.5h vs. ground truth's 14 events/3 cases/<2h; minor time discrepancy), single-occurrence unreliability, and naming inconsistencies (examples match). However, deduct for lacking ground truth's precise statistical insight (e.g., 0%-7% frequency swing, wide confidence interval, rare-event sampling error quantification); adds mild speculation (seasonal patterns, campaigns) against "no speculation" rule; doesn't specify event count or exact occurrence details. Word limit respected. Overall strong but misses key precision and introduces extras (-2.0).
