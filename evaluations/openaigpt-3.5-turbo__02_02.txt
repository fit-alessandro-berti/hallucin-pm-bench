**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict line-by-line factual precision):
- **A1**: Exact match to ground truth ("3"). Full credit.
- **A2**: Major hallucinations and errors. Wrong sequence (e.g., "Ship_Order" listed twice and before "Arrange_Delivery", inverting timestamps/order); missing correct position of "Arrange_Delivery"; fabricated extra "Ship_Order". No match to ground truth. 0 credit.
- **A3**: Major errors. Duplicated "Check_Stock" (not distinct); fabricated "Receive_Order" (never immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in any case); missing "Arrange_Delivery"; not alphabetically ordered ("Check_Stock" before "Receive_Order", but irrelevant as both wrong); wrong format (no bullets/dashes, duplicates). No match. 0 credit.

Overall: 1/3 questions correct (33% factual precision), with severe hallucinations in 2/3. Strict penalty applied for all extras/missing/fabrications.
