The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in content, pairs identified (only the two correct parallel pairs), alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list: "Create_Documentation" < "Procure_Materials", and within each C<Q, P<S), and output format (one pair per line, "Task_X  —  Task_Y" structure with appropriate spaces around "—"). Whitespace differences (e.g., alignment padding in ground truth's second line) are insignificant presentation variations not required by the prompt's format specification, which uses a non-aligned generic example. Semantically and structurally perfect under strict evaluation.
