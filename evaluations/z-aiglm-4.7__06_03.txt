The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, numbers them in the proper sequential order (1 then 2), and provides no extraneous information about Processes A or C, fully adhering to the prompt's focus and instructions. However, under utmost strictness:

- Minor deductions for: introductory sentence ("Based on Process B... are:") not present in ground truth (unnecessary verbosity); use of "and" instead of the precise BPMN-style "‖" symbol; absence of descriptive labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"; bold formatting on tasks instead of backticks; lack of closing confirmation sentence ("No other tasks...").

These are small formatting/phrasing differences but warrant a 1.5-point loss from perfection, as they deviate from the ground truth structure while preserving semantic accuracy.
