The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth, correctly stating that the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be computed due to missing durations in the log data, and that such a calculation would require those durations.

However, the LLM answer includes one unnecessary statement: "I can calculate the average cycle time of the 'Review Contract' activity." This initial phrase is misleading, as the subsequent explanation immediately contradicts it by acknowledging that there is insufficient data. This is a minor clarity issue but reflects a lack of consistency in explicitly denying calculability from the very start.

Otherwise, the answer appropriately refuses to fabricate a number, and the reasoning aligns with the ground truth. The point is deducted for the minor initial ambiguity; strictness is applied for even small errors as requested.
