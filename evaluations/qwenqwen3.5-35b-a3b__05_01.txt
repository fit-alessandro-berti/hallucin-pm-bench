**2.0**

Major differences from ground truth: 
- Wrong attachment point (`Task_RequestDocs` vs. `Task_Receive`—core flaw, as it fails to time from submission).
- Omits "interrupting" specification (critical for BPMN escalation).
- Lacks new event ID (`Timer_48h`).
- Imprecise timer (`48-hour` vs. BPMN-standard `PT48H` XML).
- No XML snippet for timer duration.
Minor matches: boundary timer event, new flow to `Task_Triage`, plain English, references IDs, similar explanation. Significant errors warrant major deduction under strict criteria.
