3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (positive, no deduction here)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exclusively, with proper capitalization, and avoids all forbidden terms. This matches the ground truth and policy perfectly (+ full credit for this aspect).
- **Structure and Format (partial credit, -1.5 points)**: The matrix format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns, using the specified roles. Headers include abbreviations (e.g., "(AM)"), which are not in the ground truth but are derived from the prompt's role list. However, the LLM combines "R, A" into single cells without bolding or separation (ground truth uses "**R / A**" bolding for emphasis and separates R/A where distinct). Activities are listed correctly, but the ground truth bolds specific terms inconsistently (e.g., **KYC Review**). No extra tasks/roles/columns added, but the table lacks the clean, minimal presentation of the ground truth.
- **RACI Assignments (major errors, -5.5 points)**: This is the core deliverable and shows the most differences, warranting severe deduction under strict evaluation. The narrative specifies primary performers (implying R), but the ground truth infers a fuller RACI with exactly one R per activity, AM as A where appropriate (e.g., oversight role), and widespread C/I for consultation/information flow (e.g., CO as C in Receive Application and Order Vetting). Key discrepancies:
  - **Receive Application**: LLM assigns only AM R/A (blanks others); ground truth adds CO C, FC I, IT I. Misses implied consultation.
  - **KYC Review**: LLM CO R/A (combined); ground truth CO R, AM A, FC C, IT I. LLM incorrectly places A on CO instead of AM; misses C/I.
  - **Order Vetting**: Similar to above—LLM only AM R/A; ground truth adds CO C, FC I, IT I.
  - **Payment Clearance**: LLM FC R/A; ground truth FC R, AM A, CO C, IT I. Misses AM A and C/I.
  - **Record Update**: LLM only IT R/A; ground truth IT R, AM C, FC C, CO I. Significant misses on C/I.
  - **Notify Customer**: LLM only AM R/A; ground truth adds CO I, FC I, IT I (minor, but still a difference).
  Overall, LLM overly simplifies by assigning R/A only to the primary performer and blanking C/I (with explicit justification, which is unwarranted), ignoring narrative implications for accountability (e.g., AM's overarching role) and typical workflow consultations/informations. Each row has 2–4 missing assignments, violating "reflect the narrative" per the judge notes. One R per activity is maintained, but that's insufficient.
- **Unwarranted Content (errors, -1.0 points)**: The LLM includes extraneous explanatory text (e.g., definitions of R/A/C/I, reasons for blanks, derivation notes, and a closing sentence about refinement). This adds ~100 words of non-essential content, contrasting the ground truth's pure matrix (no intro, notes, or commentary). Violates "no extra ... content" in rubric; even small additions count as errors under strictness.
- **Overall Correctness and Adherence (holistic, -0.5 points)**: While terminology is spot-on and no criminal/jailbreak issues, the response fails to produce a complete, narrative-reflective RACI matrix. The ground truth embodies a more comprehensive interpretation (e.g., AM accountability across steps, logical C/I flows), making the LLM's version incomplete and less accurate. Total differences across all rows and added text justify a low score—strict evaluation penalizes the pervasive gaps heavily.

This yields a 3.0: Credit for terminology and basic structure, but substantial losses for incomplete/inaccurate RACI (core output) and extras. A perfect match would be 10.0; even minor expansions like the text drop it below 5.0.
