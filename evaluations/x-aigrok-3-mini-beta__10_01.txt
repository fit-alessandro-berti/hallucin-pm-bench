The LLM answer adheres to your strict vocabulary policy: it exclusively uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance," with none of the forbidden synonyms present. The matrix structure is mostly correct, listing activities and roles, and limiting itself to the given data.

However, there are several points of significant divergence from the ground truth answer:

1. **RACI Allocations**:
   - The LLM answer steadily assigns only "R, A" (Responsible and Accountable) to the primary handler of each step, leaving "Consulted" and "Informed" blank throughout. The ground truth distribution is more nuanced, assigning C (Consulted) and I (Informed) per activity, reflecting deeper process mapping rigor. The LLM version omits these, leading to incomplete responsibility mapping.

2. **Formatting**:
   - The answer uses "R, A" together, which could cause confusion (ideally, separate columns for each letter, or at least separate cells, as in the ground truth matrix).

3. **Detail**:
   - Several secondary RACI roles are omitted. For example:
     - In "Receive Application," ground truth lists CO as Consulted (C), FC and IT as Informed (I). The LLM provides only “R, A” to AM and nothing for the rest.
     - Similarly, other roles are not acknowledged as Consulted or Informed in any step.

4. **Self-awareness/content**:
   - The LLM answer introduces a self-explanatory paragraph and a note about blank C and I assignments, but that doesn't compensate for their absence; if the process description leaves ambiguity, best practice is to infer or allocate based on typical process mapping conventions, as evidenced by the ground truth.

5. **No extra activities/roles**:
   - There are no fabricated steps, roles, or columns, which is correct.

**Conclusion**: The main vocabulary requirement is satisfied and no forbidden terms appear; however, the RACI matrix is incomplete compared to the ground truth, particularly by failing to assign Consulted and Informed roles according to the underlying process. This is a serious deficiency for a process mapping professional, even if the primary Responsibility/Accountability mapping is correct.

**Deduction rationale**:
- -3 points: Missing all C and I role assignments.
- -0.5 point: Formatting (R, A in same cell without clarity).
- Total: 6.5/10.
