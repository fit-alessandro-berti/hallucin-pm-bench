**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring):
- **Part 1 (50% weight)**: Perfect match (exact count=1, correct case/timestamp). +5.0/5.0. Minor verbosity (headers, quote) is stylistic, not erroneous.
- **Part 2 (50% weight)**: Strong overlap on tiny sample and label inconsistency (auto variants noted; LLM infers manual variants plausibly from data pattern). ≤120 words. **But deductions (-1.8 total)**:
  - Lacks GT's core quantitative precision (e.g., "0% to 7%" swing in 14 events, "wide confidence interval," "rare events sampling error")—replaced by vaguer "far too small" and unquantified risks. -0.8
  - Introduces mild speculation ("additional spellings...that an exact-string search would miss") beyond data's shown auto variants. -0.5
  - Adds non-GT emphases ("survivorship/ordering bias," "missing cases/Case 1002 incomplete")—accurate from data but shifts focus from sampling stats. -0.5
- **Overall**: High fidelity (no factual errors), but explanation diverges in precision/depth, costing points per "utmost strictness" and "small errors significant loss." Total: 8.2/10.
