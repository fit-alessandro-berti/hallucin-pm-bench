**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Structural differences (major deductions: -4.0 points)**: LLM has 3 columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support); GT has 4, introducing "Operations Manager" (unmatched). 8 tasks vs. GT's 6. LLM adds extra "Notify Regulatory Liaison" row (source-derived but not in GT) and splits "Ensure SWIFT message sent" separately (GT omits explicit SWIFT/notify). No matching row-by-row structure.
- **Task wording differences (major deductions: -2.0 points)**: LLM mostly copies source text verbatim (e.g., full "Receive the customer’s transfer instruction and log it in the system"); GT uses concise, reworded "mandated wording" (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", bolded "**KYC Review**"). Partial matches (e.g., "Screen...", "KYC Review", "Release Payment") but inexact phrasing.
- **RACI assignments (major deductions: -2.0 points)**: No row has identical assignments. E.g.:
  | Task Example | LLM | GT | Diff |
  |--------------|-----|----|------|
  | Receive... | TA: AR | TA: **R**, RL: I, OM: **A**, IT: C | Completely different |
  | Screen... | TA: AR | TA: **R**, RL: **A**, OM: I, IT: C | Partial TA R, but A/C/I mismatch |
  | KYC Review | RL: AR | TA: C, RL: **R**, OM: **A**, IT: I | RL R similar, but split/multi-role mismatch |
  | Release | TA: R, RL: A | TA: **R**, RL: I, OM: **A**, IT: C | TA R similar, A/I/C mismatch |
  Others (SWIFT, Archive, Notify) unmatchable due to GT omissions.
- **Format/RACI notation errors (significant deductions: -2.0 points)**: LLM uses non-standard "AR" (combined shorthand, invalid for pure RACI); GT uses single bolded **R/A/C/I**. No legend in LLM (GT has explicit one). Header "Task" vs. GT's "Task / Activity (mandated wording)". No bolds.
- **Strengths (minor credit: +2.0 base)**: Correctly uses mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without violations. Markdown table format. Covers source steps comprehensively (no omissions like GT's missing SWIFT/notify).
- **Overall**: Massive divergences in core elements (assignments, structure, completeness vs. GT). Strict policy applied: even partial similarities insufficient; small formatting/RACI errors compound to near-minimum. Equivalent to ~25% fidelity.
