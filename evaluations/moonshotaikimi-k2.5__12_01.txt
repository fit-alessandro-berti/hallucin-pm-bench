The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the user prompt with evidence from all relevant cases (1001–1003), correctly disproving the fact using timestamps and activities. It matches the ground truth's structure (verdict + bulleted justifications), identifies reversed ordering in 1001/1003, absence in 1002, and intermediate activity in 1003.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total):**
- Slight phrasing imprecision in Case 1003 ("neither immediately before nor after"): Authorize_Refunds *is* after Update_Inventory (with Quality_Check intervening), though not immediately before (per claim); "nor after" is ambiguous/misleading vs. ground truth's precise "before ... not after it."
- No explicit concluding summary sentence (e.g., ground truth's "in none ... false"), but implied and brevity aligns with "short justification."
- Uses timestamps (valid) vs. ground truth's line numbers, but equivalent citation.

Strict evaluation: Near-perfect fidelity, only semantic nitpick impacts score.
