The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in core content, structure, and precision: both correctly identify the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A, explain the lack of timestamps for durations/variance/CI, and adhere to the "one short paragraph" format without guessing or extraneous details. Minor deduction for slight verbosity (e.g., explicitly dissecting Artefact B's irrelevance, which ground truth implies but omits) and not phrasing the conclusion as bluntly as "Impossible" or suggesting "additional raw log entries," though these are negligible enhancements rather than errors.
