9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and very close to the ground truth. It:

- Clearly states that the calculation is not possible due to the absence of actual event data, specifying that all rows and timestamps are redacted.
- Correctly notes that neither average nor dispersion nor a confidence interval can be computed, for precisely the reason given.
- Appropriately identifies that information from Artefact B (SLA Catalogue) does not permit computation of the required metrics.
- Avoids guessing or using outside knowledge.
- Provides a concise, logical, and plain-text explanation.

Minor discrepancy: The LLM answer elaborates slightly more than the ground truth by referencing the irrelevant SLA data explicitly and spelling out that both sample size and time pairs are missing. While this is helpful and not incorrect, the slight increase in verbosity (especially mentioning the â‰ˆ7.8 days data from the SLA) is a minor stylistic difference from the ground truth, which asks only for the minimal, direct conclusion.

Otherwise, the substance fully matches. According to strict criteria, this negligible difference warrants a small deduction.

Final score: 9.5
