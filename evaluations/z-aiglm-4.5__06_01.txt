9.0

The LLM answer identifies exactly the two correct pairs and outputs the final result in the required format, matching both the content and the order of the ground truth answer. However, there are two notable minor issues:

1. The LLM includes leading explanatory text, bullet points, and internal reasoning, rather than outputting strictly the required one pair per line, as specified. This does not match the requirement for "Output one pair per line, using the format Task_X  —  Task_Y" and nothing else.
2. The LLM uses inconsistent spacing in the second line:  
    - "Procure_Materials    —  Schedule_Machines" uses more spaces than in the ground truth answer ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"), though this is a very minor formatting detail.

Given the instruction to penalize even small errors significantly, these deviations justify a deduction. Therefore, the answer is highly accurate, but not strictly perfect per instruction. Thus, 9.0.
