**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (full credit areas)**: Correctly identifies *all* changes with 100% accuracy in content—no extras, misses, or violations (e.g., ignores renamings like "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name change, flows, IDs reorder). Uses *exactly* the 3 required headings. Groups perfectly. Concise and on-task.
- **Deductions (strict penalties for differences vs. ground truth)**:
  - **Task listings (-1.0)**: Uses only IDs (e.g., "Task_VerifyIdentity"); ground truth prioritizes **bold names** with `(`ID`)` parens for readability/meaning (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"). IDs alone are precise but less complete summary; significant diff in informativeness.
  - **Formatting/structure (-0.5)**: Bullets (`-`) vs. numbered lists (`1.`, `2.`); **bold headings** vs. `* **...**`; no `## **Expected Answer Key**` intro or final confirmatory note ("*(No other...)*"). Direct but mismatches expected style.
  - **Gateway phrasing (-0.5)**: "Exclusive → Inclusive" correct but terse; misses explanatory "(XOR)" / "(OR)", *v1*/*v2* refs, "changed from ... to ...", and bolding for emphasis.
- **Overall**: Excellent factual match (90%+ semantic similarity), but strict format/content presentation diffs (names absent, verbosity gap) warrant deductions per "utmost strictness" and "small errors → significant loss." Not identical = not 10.0.
