**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, sequence, distinct elements, and ordering. Q1 matches exactly (3). Q2 matches the activity sequence precisely, including all four events for C002 in order with correct → separators (underscores are present and unescaped as appropriate for plain text). Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock) one per line and alphabetically ordered, matching the prompt's exact instruction. Minor presentational differences (e.g., bolded question labels matching prompt's Q1/Q2/Q3 vs. ground truth's A1/A2/A3; plain lines vs. bulleted <br> in table) do not alter factual precision, as no extras, omissions, or hallucinations occur. Perfect match under strict line-by-line evaluation.
