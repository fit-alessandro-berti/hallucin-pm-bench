The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content and correctness, with all three responses accurately addressing the questions: 3 distinct cases, "Pack_Items" precedes "Ship_Order" for C456, and "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once. The only minor difference is the ground truth's additional enumeration of case IDs (not required by the prompt's question phrasing) and formatting labels (**A1:** etc.), which the LLM omitted to adhere to the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction. No factual errors or significant deviations exist.
