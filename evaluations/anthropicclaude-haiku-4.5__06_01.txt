The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B, lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format with one pair per line and the exact separator "â€”". The spacing in the pairs closely matches the ground truth, though minor alignment differences (e.g., extra spaces in ground truth for column-like formatting on the second pair) prevent a perfect match. The core content is identical and accurate per the process description.

However, under strict evaluation, the LLM deviates by adding an unrequested header, introductory sentence, and a detailed "Explanation" section with bold formatting and non-alphabetical task ordering within the bullet text (e.g., "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation" instead of alphabetical). The ground truth includes a "*Rationale*" with italicized bullets, direct quotes from the description, and an explicit note on exclusivity ("these are the only"), which the LLM's explanation omits. These additions and omissions introduce unnecessary extras beyond the prompt's output instructions (limited to pairs only) and format mismatches with the ground truth's structure and wording, resulting in a significant deduction despite the high fidelity of the primary list.
