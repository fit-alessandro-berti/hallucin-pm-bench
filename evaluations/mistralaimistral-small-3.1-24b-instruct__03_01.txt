### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core process flow correctly (start → classification → conditional paths for password reset vs. diagnosis → post-diagnosis decision → specialist loopback to resolve → confirmation → close/loop), including the re-work loop to "Initial Diagnosis" and no unauthorized additions like timers or extra events. It uses three exclusive gateways as needed (despite the prompt's erroneous mention of "two"), matching the ground truth structurally and keeping the XML under 40 lines with concise IDs.

However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions for the following differences from the ground truth (each small error incurs major loss):
- **Structural/XML syntax errors (-1.5)**: Missing `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` declaration. Definitions has extraneous `id="SupportTicketProcess"` and mismatched `targetNamespace="http://acmetech.com/bpmn"` (vs. ground's "http://acmetech/support" with no ID). Process `isExecutable="true"` vs. ground's `"false"`. Invalid `xsi:type="tFormulas:tFormalExpression"` in all conditions (should be `"tFormalExpression"` without the erroneous "tFormulas" prefix, which is non-standard and breaks BPMN validity).
- **Invented elements in conditions (-2.0)**: All `<conditionExpression>` use fabricated variables (e.g., `${classification == 'Password Reset'}`, `${resolved == true}`, `${confirmed == false}`), violating the prompt's "Do not invent" rule. Ground truth uses simple, non-invented `"yes"`/`"no"` strings, which align with exact translation without assumptions.
- **Naming mismatches (-1.5)**: Several inexact names deviating from description/ground truth, e.g., start event ("Customer submits a support ticket" vs. "Ticket Submitted"); t1 ("Automatically classify ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification"); gw1 ("Check ticket classification" vs. "Password Reset?"); gw2 ("Issue Resolved" vs. "Resolved Internally?"); gw3 ("Customer Confirmation" vs. "Customer Confirms?"); end ("Ticket is closed" vs. "Ticket Closed"). These are small but cumulative errors in precise translation.
- **ID and minor ordering issues (-0.5)**: Inconsistent IDs (e.g., process "SupportTicketProcess" vs. "support_ticket"; flows "flow1" vs. "f1"; end "end1" vs. "end"). Element order is non-sequential (e.g., t3 defined before its incoming flow), though refs are correct—still a nit but deductable for strict XML cleanliness.

No hallucinations (e.g., no added timers, approvals, or parallels), and the loop/specialist path is exact. Logic fidelity is high (~85%), but syntactic/naming/condition deviations drop it below passing under strict criteria.
