### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but deviates significantly in key areas, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Major deductions for the following errors and differences:

- **Activity Selection (Core Requirement - Severe Mismatch, -4.0 points)**: The prompt demands the *three worst-performing activities* based *jointly* on SLA breaches *and* high waiting times. Ground truth correctly identifies Legal Approval (+300s breach, 600s wait), Risk Review (+300s, 480s), and Credit Assessment (+60s, 200s)—prioritizing joint severity (Credit's breach and wait outperform Verify's minor +30s/80s). LLM incorrectly selects Verify Identity as third (weak joint metrics: small breach and wait), swapping out Credit. This is a fundamental failure in analysis, inverting the data-driven prioritization.

- **Quantification of SLA Excesses (Minor Alignment with Errors, -1.0 point)**: LLM correctly quantifies excesses for its chosen activities (e.g., Risk Review +300s as 600s vs. 300s; Legal +300s; Verify +30s). However, it omits Credit Assessment entirely and frames Verify's metrics inaccurately relative to joint criteria (e.g., emphasizing its low wait/breach as "concerning"). Ground truth uses precise phrasing like "average throughput **900 s** vs. 600 s SLA (+300 s)" and includes total cases (≈4,805, derived from data). LLM invents a date (Oct 26, 2023) not in data and lacks case aggregation.

- **Recommendations (Partial Structure but Content Mismatch, -1.5 points)**: Both use bullets *only* for recommendations, as required. However, LLM's actions are generic and loosely data-driven (e.g., "additional analyst staffing" for Risk Review's 480s wait; "standardize clauses" for Legal's 600s; "automate verification" for Verify's 80s—none match ground truth's specificity). Ground truth provides concrete, targeted actions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks" for Legal bypass; "add one risk analyst" with automation for Risk; "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k" for Credit—tied to process flows, though €25k is an unprompted invention). LLM's recs ignore Credit and lack projected impact (e.g., ground truth's 35% cycle time reduction).

- **Overall Memo Structure and Fidelity (Surface Alignment with Inconsistencies, +0.5 points partial credit)**: Both are ≈150 words, executive-style memos addressing the COO, grounded in table data (no absent activities/metrics invented beyond date). LLM adds an unnecessary intro paragraph before recs; ground truth integrates analysis fluidly with a closing projection. From/Subject lines differ (e.g., "Process Performance Office" vs. "Senior Process-Performance Analyst"; no matching date). LLM returns only memo text, as instructed.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts for critical analytical errors (selection/recommendations) and minor deviations (phrasing/structure/inventions). Small issues like mismatched headers and lack of projection amplify strictness, but partial data grounding prevents a floor score.
