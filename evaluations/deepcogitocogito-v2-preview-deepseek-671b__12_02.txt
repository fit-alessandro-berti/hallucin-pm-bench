The LLM answer correctly identifies the primary counterexample in C003 (lines 6-7) where Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order, leading to the accurate "No" conclusion, and structures a justification paragraph that cites relevant case-IDs and line numbers. However, it fails to recognize or mention the second critical counterexample in C005 (line 11), where Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order, which directly violates the "always follows" claim and is explicitly highlighted in the ground truth as proof of falsehood. This omission misinterprets the scope of the claim, implying it only applies when both activities are present, whereas the claim requires Receive_Order to precede every Validate_Payment instance. Additionally, the response includes extraneous introductory reasoning ("Okay, let's break this down...") before the required "No" answer, violating the prompt's strict format of "Answer **“Yes” or “No” only**, then justify in one paragraph." These errors—missing a key violation and format non-compliance—warrant significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
