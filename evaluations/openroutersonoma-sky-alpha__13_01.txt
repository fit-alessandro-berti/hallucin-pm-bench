9.0

1. Correct: "1" (matches ideal answer)
2. Correct: "5.56" (slightly less precise than "5.56 %" but the implied % is present from the question wording; however, lacking the percent sign loses a fraction of a point due to strictness)
3. Correct: "A1002" (matches ideal answer; clear statement)
4. Substantially correct: Small sample size (addressed well); temporal bias (addressed well). Explanations are phrased slightly differently than ground truth but have equivalent meaning and do not add unstated assumptions. The phrase "single day," while a small stretch (since the log is implicitly from the morning of a single day only, not the full day), is very minorâ€”there is no fabrication outside what the log directly supports.

Deduction:
- Minimal deduction (~0.5 points) for (2) not explicitly including the percent sign, and for (4) the phrase "single day" rather than "morning window".
- Small deduction due to not mentioning case-mix or survivorship bias (but only two required).

All four answers are fully supported by the log. No hallucination or major omission. Some very minor imprecision in format and strictness of explanation, but not content.

Final strict score: 9.0
