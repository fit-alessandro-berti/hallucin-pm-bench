8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: The LLM provides "1", which matches the core numerical answer but omits the word "occurrence" present in the ground truth ("`1` occurrence"). This is a minor phrasing deviation, but under strict criteria, it warrants a small deduction for not fully mirroring the expected format.
- **Question 2**: The LLM gives "5.56", correctly calculating the value (1/18 ≈ 5.56), but omits the "%" symbol and unit explicitly required by the prompt ("percentage... Round to two decimal places") and shown in ground truth ("`5.56 %`"). This is a clear formatting omission, resulting in a significant point loss for incompleteness.
- **Question 3**: The LLM lists "A1002", which accurately identifies the single case but lacks the explanatory phrasing in the ground truth ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”."). While the list itself is correct, the deviation from the more descriptive ideal answer leads to a moderate deduction for brevity over precision.
- **Question 4**: The LLM provides two clear, relevant reasons (small sample size with variance explanation; temporal bias with representation issues), directly aligning with two of the ground truth options (small sample size and temporal bias). Elaborations are appropriate and derived from the log without hallucination, earning full credit here.

Overall, the response is mostly accurate and adheres to the log data without inference errors, but small formatting and phrasing inconsistencies (especially in Q2) reduce the score under strict evaluation. No major hallucinations or off-topic content.
