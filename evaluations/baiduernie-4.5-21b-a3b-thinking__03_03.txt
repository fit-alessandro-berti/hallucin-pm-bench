1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally flawed and does not produce a valid, semantically equivalent BPMN 2.0 XML compared to the ground truth. Key issues include:

- **Structural invalidity**: References undefined task `wrc_task_send_rejection` in sequence flows (e.g., `wrc_flow_gw3_out`), causing parse errors. No element definition for "Send rejection notice".
- **Missing critical sequence flow**: No flow from `wrc_gw_3` (warranty gateway) "Yes" branch to `wrc_split_parallel`, rendering the parallel activities unreachable for eligible claims. The process cannot proceed to success after warranty check.
- **Incorrect loop for re-validation**: Flow from `wrc_task_request_missing` targets `wrc_gw_2` (gateway) instead of `wrc_task_validate` (task), violating the requirement to "re-validating" after receiving information. This creates an illogical loop without re-execution of validation.
- **Omission of required task**: No task for "**checks warranty eligibility**" (explicitly mentioned activity); direct jump from completeness gateway to warranty gateway, but without proper sequencing post-validation.
- **Non-verbatim task names**: Variations like "Validate the claim" (prompt: "**validates the claim**"), "Request missing information" (prompt: "**requests missing information**"), introducing grammatical/capitalization mismatches.
- **Extra/hallucinated content**: Includes full `bpmndi:BPMNDiagram` section (unrequired; ground truth is minimal without layout). Duplicate/erroneous namespaces (`bpmn2` and `bpmn`). Post-XML commentary (e.g., "This XML diagram: 1.") violates "single self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document".
- **Incomplete flows and elements**: Parallel split lacks incoming from warranty decision. No event names (ground truth includes descriptive names like "Online warranty claim submitted"). Process flow cannot reach `wrc_end_success` correctly.
- **Semantically non-equivalent**: The model breaks the core process logic (eligibility check → parallel activities → success), omitting/inventing paths in ways that hallucinate invalid structure while missing explicit requirements.

Even minor namespace differences or whitespace would be tolerant per rubric, but these are major omissions, inventions, and errors in required elements, flows, and verbatim modeling, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
