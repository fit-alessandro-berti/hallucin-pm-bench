- Q1 matches closely in content and conciseness, with only minor wording variation ("distinct" added).
- Q2 is factually correct but violates conciseness by adding explanatory phrasing beyond the expected single activity name.
- Q3 is factually correct but similarly verbose, straying from the minimal ground truth format.
