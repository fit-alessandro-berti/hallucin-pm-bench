9.5

- Q1: The LLM answer gives the correct case count and lists the values, which is fine (the ground truth doesn't list values, but that is extra information, not an error).
- Q2: The answer is precise and matches the ground truth.
- Q3: The answer is correct and matches the ground truth.

The only minor deviation is some unnecessary quotation marks and listing out the case values explicitly for Q1 (not strictly required per the prompt), but this is a minimal cosmetic difference. The answers are accurate and concise. That said, since the grading is to be strict and even small errors are penalized, the (trivial) formatting difference and superfluous information reduce the grade slightly from perfect.
