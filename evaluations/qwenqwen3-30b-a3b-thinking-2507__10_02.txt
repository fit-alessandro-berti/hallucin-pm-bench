The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt by correctly using the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and producing a Markdown RACI table. However, it incurs significant deductions for the following strict evaluation criteria, resulting in a low score due to multiple omissions, inaccuracies, and structural deviations from the ground truth:

- **Task Coverage (major omissions, -3.0)**: The LLM answer omits critical tasks from the source text, including "Screen Against Sanctions List" (step 2) and "Approve High-Risk Transactions" (step 4). It combines KYC Review (step 3) with approval, diluting specificity. "Log transfer instruction" partially covers step 1 but ignores "receive"; "Release payment" and "Send SWIFT message" partially address step 5 but fragment it without full alignment. "Archive case file" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison" partially cover step 6 but add an unnecessary separate "notify" row, which the ground truth integrates implicitly via "I" assignments. The ground truth comprehensively maps all steps without such gaps or inventions.

- **RACI Assignments and Roles (inaccurate mappings, -1.5)**: Assignments diverge substantially (e.g., LLM makes Transaction Analyst accountable for logging, while ground truth assigns A to Operations Manager; LLM lacks Consulted/Informed entries in most rows, unlike the ground truth's detailed distributions). The LLM introduces no "Operations Manager" (present in ground truth), sticking closer to source roles but failing to reflect the ground truth's oversight structure. IT Support is handled similarly, but overall, the RACI logic does not match (e.g., no "C" or "I" for screening or approval).

- **Structure and Formatting (deviations, -1.0)**: The LLM uses a task-row format with separate columns for R/A/C/I (valid but simplistic), while the ground truth uses role-columns with letter entries in cells, mandated wording in task headers (e.g., bold "**KYC Review**"), and a explicit legend. No header like "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" or legend in LLM, reducing clarity. Minor wording issues (e.g., "case file" vs. ground truth's "Archive Record") add to the disconnect.

- **Vocabulary and Fidelity (minor adherence, -0.5)**: Correct use of mandated terms is a strength, but tasks lack the ground truth's precise phrasing (e.g., no "Receive Payment Instruction" or bolding). The LLM does not explicitly note mapping "every step... without omissions," as emphasized in the ground truth notes.

Overall, while the LLM answer is a functional table without violating core rules, its incompleteness and mismatches to the ground truth's comprehensive, structured ideal warrant a failing-to-mediocre score under utmost strictness.
