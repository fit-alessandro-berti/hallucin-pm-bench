3.0

The LLM answer shows some attempt to follow instructions but contains multiple major errors when compared to the ground truth, demanding a strict deduction of points as per your request:

**Major issues:**

- **Omission of “Operations Manager”:** The role "Operations Manager" was present in the ground truth as Accountable in every row, but it is missing entirely in the LLM answer.
- **Activities wording:** Task phrasing is inconsistent and partially inaccurate – for example, "Conduct KYC Review" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison" do not strictly match the mapping in the ground truth, and other steps like "Approve High-Risk Transactions" (present in the ground truth) are missing entirely.
- **Accountabilities:** Often assigns Accountable (A) to the Responsible party (e.g., “Transaction Analyst” is both Responsible and Accountable for logging and releasing payments), missing the separation of duties mandated in the ground truth.
- **Consulted/Informed columns:** The “Consulted” and “Informed” columns are almost entirely empty or incorrectly filled, while in the ground truth, these fields are systematically populated (especially with Operations Manager and IT Support).
- **Not all steps present:** The LLM answer has missed tasks; for example, "Approve High-Risk Transactions" is omitted, and "Screen Against Sanctions List" is not split out or worded as per the mandate.
- **Inconsistent terminology for tasks:** The LLM answer inconsistently applies “KYC Review” — sometimes as a label, sometimes using "Conduct" which is not mandated. Step names are not strictly aligned with the ground truth.

**Minor issues:**

- Cases like “Notify Regulatory Liaison” as a task misrepresent what should be an “Informed” status, not a standalone task.

Overall, while some mandated terms are used and it's formatted as a RACI table, the deviations are significant and systemic. Therefore, as per your instructions for utmost strictness and penalizing even minor deviations, the score must be low—a 3.0 reflects visible effort but persistent and critical faults in role inclusion, column assignment, and process mapping.
