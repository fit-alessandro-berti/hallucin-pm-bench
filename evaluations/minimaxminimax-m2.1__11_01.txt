9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 correctly ranked by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1: 36.5/120.0; Send_Closure_Letter #2: 12.2/44.0; Assess_Liability #3: 7.8/16.4). Numbers quoted verbatim with minor stylistic "h"/"95p" abbreviation (acceptable, no factual error).
- **No unwarranted content**: Fully compliant—no service times, throughput, or other activities mentioned.
- **Action relevance**: All three actions concrete, logically tied to waiting times, specify ≥20% reduction (22%, 25%, 20%). "Projected" implies data basis (mirrors ground truth's "estimated"/"pilot"), no unsupported invention.
- **Format/Structure/Conciseness**: Crisp memo ≤150 words (~110). Headers/closing enhance "executive memo" professionalism vs. ground truth's bare list (+), but invented "June 2025" date (-0.3), extra summary sentence (-0.2), wordier phrasing (-0.3). Actions differ entirely from ground truth (-0.2 for non-identical content under strict diff scoring).
- **Overall**: Exemplary fulfillment; minor stylistic/extraneous diffs prevent perfect 10.0 under utmost strictness.
