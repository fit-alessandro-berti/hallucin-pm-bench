4.0

- **Strengths:**  
  - The LLM generally follows the mandated vocabulary, using "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst" exactly as required for the most part.
  - The process steps from the source text are all represented in the RACI, with activities/roles mapped.
  - Uses a clear Markdown format.
- **Major errors:**  
  - **Accountable Role Missing:** The ground truth includes an "Operations Manager" as Accountable for almost every process step, but the LLM omits this role entirely. This is a critical omission.
  - **Assignment of Accountabilities:** The LLM marks "Regulatory Liaison" as Accountable (A) for almost all tasks, but in the ground truth, Regulatory Liaison is seldom Accountable—usually Responsible or Informed.
  - **Responsibility/Consultation Distribution:** Responsibilities and consultative roles between Transaction Analyst and Regulatory Liaison are mis-assigned versus the ground truth. For example, on "Screen payment against sanctions," the LLM makes the Transaction Analyst Responsible and Regulatory Liaison Accountable—but ground truth makes Regulatory Liaison Accountable and Transaction Analyst Responsible.
  - **Addition of Activity:** "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case file archival" is added, which is not a ground truth task.
- **Minor errors:**  
  - Activity wording does not always exactly match the ground truth (e.g., "Receive and log customer's transfer instruction" instead of "Receive Payment Instruction," "Archive case file" instead of "Archive Record").
  - Consulted and Informed roles are inconsistently mapped compared to the ground truth.
  - The legend for R/A/C/I is missing, and column headers do not match the ground truth exactly, though this is minor.

**Conclusion:**  
The LLM maintains the vocabulary mandate and process coverage but makes major structural errors in role coverage (missing Operations Manager entirely, mis-assigning "Accountable," inconsistent with consult/inform mappings). Even minor wording deviations further reduce the grade. Stringent assessment and comparison with ground truth support a low mid-range score of 4.0.
