2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, roles, tasks, and assignments, warranting a low score. Key differences include:

- **Format and Presentation (major error, -3.0 points)**: LLM uses a task-row format with R/A/C/I as explicit columns and full role names in cells, plus a descriptive header. Ground truth uses a role-column format with tasks as rows, abbreviations (R/A/C/I) in cells, a "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header, bolding for mandated terms (e.g., **KYC Review**), a "Legend" section, and an explanatory note below. This mismatch in layout and additional elements (e.g., no legend or bolding in LLM) is a fundamental structural failure.

- **Roles (major error, -2.0 points)**: LLM correctly uses only mandated roles ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") plus "IT Support" from the source text, but omits "Operations Manager" entirely, which is central to ground truth's assignments (A for most tasks). This results in incomplete role coverage and redistributed responsibilities (e.g., Regulatory Liaison over-assigned as A in LLM).

- **Tasks Coverage and Wording (major error, -2.0 points)**: LLM expands to 8 rows, adding separate entries for "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case file archival," which over-interprets step 5 and 6 without matching ground truth's consolidation. Ground truth has exactly 6 concise rows (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction," "Archive Record") with mandated wording emphasized. LLM's tasks are longer and not identically phrased (e.g., "Receive and log customer's transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's shorter version), and it misses ground truth's exact titling like "**KYC Review**" as a standalone row header.

- **Assignments (major error, -1.0 points)**: R/A/C/I distributions differ per task. Examples:
  - Receive: LLM (TA=R, RL=A); Ground truth (TA=R, RL=I, OM=A, IT=C) – mismatches on A, I, C.
  - Screen: Partial match (TA=R, RL=A), but misses OM=I, IT=C.
  - KYC Review: LLM (RL=R/A, TA=C); Ground truth (RL=R, OM=A, TA=C, IT=I) – misses OM and IT, incorrect A.
  - Similar mismatches across rows, with LLM leaving many cells empty vs. ground truth's full assignments for all roles.

While LLM adheres well to mandated vocabulary (e.g., "KYC Review," no forbidden terms like "CDD"), uses Markdown, and covers the source text without omissions, these positives are outweighed by the cumulative deviations. No single element matches ground truth closely enough for a passing score; even minor phrasing variances (e.g., "case file" vs. "Record") deduct further under strict criteria.
