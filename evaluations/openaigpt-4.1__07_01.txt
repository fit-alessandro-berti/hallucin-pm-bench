7.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Strengths (contributing to higher score)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). Headings match the prompt's specified format (• bullets). No speculation or extra content. No "(none)" needed as categories have items.
- **Weaknesses (causing point deduction)**: 
  - Tasks are listed only by ID (e.g., "check_vip"), omitting the full 'name' attributes from XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status"). Ground truth includes both name and ID explicitly, which is a significant omission under strict "use element names exactly" rule—loses ~1.5 points.
  - No structured sub-bullets (*) or inline formatting (e.g., **bold** for types, (v1)/(v2) versioning in gateway change), differing from ground truth's presentation—minor formatting mismatch, but strictness deducts ~0.5 points.
  - Lacks ground truth's closing note ("*(No other differences should be reported.)*"), though not required by prompt—slight completeness gap, deducts ~0.5 points.
- **Overall**: Factually accurate but incomplete in detail and formatting relative to ground truth; 7.5 reflects strong core match with deductions for precision errors.
