7.0

- Correctly identifies added tasks and removed task, and the gateway type change.
- Uses element names exactly as in the XML (âœ”), and doesn't speculate.
- However, does not use the full required format: does not include task names or IDs as in the ground truth, just element names.
- Doesn't bold or structure according to the given headings (uses bullets, not explicit heading titles).
- Minor but meaningful formatting/clarity loss: the lack of explicit task names and IDs is a nontrivial omission, as is not replicating the heading/structure verbatim.
- Thus, a significant penalty is warranted, but since all content is correct and no hallucinations or missed changes are present, not below 7.0.
