**6.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Scoring):
- **Format**: Perfect JSON schema compliance (no deduction).
- **Q1**: Exact match (3 distinct cases: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). +2.0 points.
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in A-9321). +2.0 points.
- **Q3**: Exact match (earliest: 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00). +2.0 points.
- **Q4**: Exact match (2 occurrences: B-1045, C-77). +2.0 points.
- **Q5**: Complete mismatch. Ground truth: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] (activities never first; firsts are Receive_Order x2, Quality_Check x1). LLM: ["Quality_Check", "Receive_Order"] (inverts logic, lists *only* the first activities, zero overlap). -4.0 points (full deduction for major factual error; 0/3 items correct under strict per-item assessment).

**Total: 8.0/12.0 = 6.0** (weighted by question complexity/items; utmost strictness applied—no partial credit for misunderstanding core log analysis like per-case first events from shuffled timestamps).
