**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in verdict (FALSE/inaccurate), case-specific evidence (reversed order in 1001/1003, absence in 1002 disproving "always"), and refutation of claim components (order, immediacy/adjacency, universality). It strictly adheres to the data, cites exact timestamps/cases/sequences without guessing or error, and provides a clear, evidence-based justification. Stylistic differences (table vs. bullets, added summary) enhance clarity without deviation or addition of unsupported info; length remains reasonably short and on-topic despite elaboration. No errors or differences in substance.
