7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (Core Changes)**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), the single removed task (Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change (from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision). No factual errors or omissions in the structural changes. This aligns closely with the ground truth, earning strong marks here.
- **Differences and Deductions (Strict Assessment)**:
  - **Formatting and Structure (Significant Deduction: -1.5 points)**: The LLM uses simple bullet points (-) without numbering, bolding (**), or backticks (`) for IDs/names, unlike the ground truth's structured numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) with **bold names** and `ID` formatting. Headings include the prompt's example "(e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)", which the ground truth omits for a cleaner presentation. This deviates from the expected polished, key-like format, treated as a notable presentation error under strictness.
  - **Gateway Description Detail (Significant Deduction: -0.5 points)**: The LLM's phrasing ("Gateway_Decision: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway") is concise but lacks the ground truth's explanatory depth, such as "changed from **exclusive** (XOR) in *v1* to **inclusive** (OR) in *v2*". As a "meticulous process-mining analyst," including XOR/OR semantics and version references is expected for precision; the omission is a small but evaluable gap.
  - **Completeness (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: The ground truth ends with an explicit confirmation note ("*(No other additions, removals, or gateway-type changes are present.)*"), reinforcing exhaustiveness. The LLM omits this, potentially implying incompleteness despite covering all changes.
- **Overall**: High fidelity to the prompt's required headings and content (no ignored changes like renamings), but strict penalties for stylistic/verbal mismatches reduce from a perfect 10.0. No criminal or off-policy issues detected.
