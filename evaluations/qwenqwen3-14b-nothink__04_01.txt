7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and the specific violations (Rules 2 and 3), matching the ground truth's conclusion. It also accurately assesses Rules 1, 4, and 5 as satisfied. However, significant deductions are warranted for multiple errors in the justifications: (1) inconsistent and incorrect labeling (e.g., "Rule 1 violation" followed by "satisfied"; "Rule 3 compliance" followed by "violated"), which undermines clarity and precision; (2) factual inaccuracy in Rule 3's distance calculation (claims "4 activities between #6 and #10" and lists #7–#10, incorrectly including the target activity and overcounting the intervening ones—should be 3 intervening activities for a distance of 3 or 4 depending on definition, but the explanation is wrong); (3) minor structural sloppiness in mixing compliance labels with violation explanations, deviating from the ground truth's consistent "Satisfied/Violated" format per rule. These issues reflect careless execution in detailed reasoning, justifying a mid-range score despite the correct high-level outcome.
