The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), task names, and format (`Task_X  —  Task_Y` with appropriate spacing around the em dash). The minor visual difference in padding spaces on the second line of the ground truth appears to be an artifact of alignment for presentation in the evaluation message (common in monospaced text blocks), not a required output specification. No functional or specified formatting errors exist; pairs are precisely the two parallel pairs from Process B. Under strict evaluation, this is a perfect match.
