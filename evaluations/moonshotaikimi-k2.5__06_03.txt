The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two concurrent task sets from Process B, numbered in the correct order (first Parallel Split #1: Quality_Check and Update_Inventory; second Parallel Split #2: Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement), with no extraneous information about Processes A or C, fully matching the prompt's requirements and the core content of the ground truth. Minor deductions for stylistic differences only: uses "and" instead of "‖" symbol, bold formatting (`**`) instead of backticks (`` ` ``), lacks descriptive headers ("Set 1 – first parallel block:"), and omits the final confirmatory sentence ("No other tasks..."). These are presentational variances, not substantive errors, but per strict evaluation criteria, they warrant a small point loss.
