4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates some understanding of the prompt and applies the mandated vocabulary for roles and activities. However, it falls short in several areas, including strictness of vocabulary usage, completeness of roles, and mapping accuracy. The errors are summarized below:

1. **Missing Mandated Roles:**  
   - The ground truth answer includes an "Operations Manager" column, consistently marked as Accountable (A) across all steps. This role (even if possibly an inferred process owner) is **entirely missing** from the LLM answer. Omitting a process owner means the RACI is incomplete.

2. **Incorrect/Nonstandard Task Wording:**  
   - The LLM answer sometimes paraphrases the activities (“Log transfer instruction in system”, “Screen payment against sanctions list”, “Send SWIFT message”) instead of aligning strictly to the vocabulary or structure that matches the ground truth (e.g., “Receive Payment Instruction,” “Release Payment,” “Archive Record”).  
   - "KYC Review" — the exact mandated term — is not used as a task label; instead, it says “Conduct KYC Review on sender/beneficiary,” which introduces unauthorized verbage.

3. **Accountability Omissions:**  
   - The table mostly uses "R" for Responsible and, for KYC Review/Approval, uses the "Notes" column to indicate Accountable (“A (Regulatory Liaison)”). This is improper RACI formatting, and it does not actually map **A** in the main matrix as required.
   - For several process steps, Accountable is missing or unclear; strict RACI demands that every row have exactly one Accountable.

4. **RACI Assignment Accuracy:**  
   - In some steps, the LLM combines “Consulted” and “Accountable” or omits "Consulted" (C) actors that appear in the ground truth.
   - Example: In “Screen payment against sanctions list”, Regulatory Liaison should be Accountable (“A”), not Consulted (“C”).
   - For "Archive case file"/"Archive Record," the LLM has Regulatory Liaison as "I" (correctly), but does not indicate who is Accountable, and omits "Consulted" roles.

5. **Unnecessary/Unused Columns and Notation:**  
   - Introduces a Notes column with explanations, which is not present in the ground truth and could introduce ambiguity.
   - Uses "-" for "not involved," but doesn't make this explicit in legend, and it's not strictly necessary.

6. **Other Vocabulary Deviations:**  
   - Task wording does not always strictly follow the mandated or derived phrases (“Conduct KYC Review on sender/beneficiary” instead of simply “KYC Review”).
   - Uses descriptions like “Send SWIFT message” instead of “Release Payment” or similar mapped wording.

**Summary:**  
- The submission captures basic structure but misses required strictness in both vocabulary and role definition.  
- Lack of the "Operations Manager" (Accountable role) throughout is a major gap.  
- Accountability mapping is functionally incorrect or incomplete.  
- Small but significant deviations in task wording and RACI assignments.

Therefore, the score is a **4.0** due to multiple impactful deviations, both in form and content, from the ground truth.
