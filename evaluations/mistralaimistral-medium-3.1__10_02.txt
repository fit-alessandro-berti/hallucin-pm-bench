3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and fidelity to the RACI format, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: 
  - Columns: LLM uses "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "IT Support", and a non-standard "Notes" column, omitting "Operations Manager" present in ground truth. This alters the role framework entirely.
  - No dedicated "Accountable" (A) placements in the table body for most rows; LLM relegates A to ad-hoc "Notes" (only for KYC Review and approval), making it incomplete and non-standard. Ground truth integrates A consistently via the Operations Manager column.
  - Extra row in LLM ("Send SWIFT message") splits ground truth's combined "Release Payment" task, introducing fragmentation not in the source or ground truth.

- **Task Wording and Coverage (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Inconsistent phrasing: e.g., LLM's "Log transfer instruction in system" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Conduct KYC Review on sender/beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**" (ground truth uses mandated term more precisely without extras); "Release payment post-approval" vs. "Release Payment"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record". These are small but cumulative errors per strictness rule.
  - Misses full coverage: LLM omits distinct "Receive" aspect of step 1 and combines archiving notification improperly; ground truth maps steps more directly (e.g., no separate SWIFT row).
  - All tasks use mandated vocabulary (e.g., "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison"), which is correct but insufficient to offset mismatches.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Near-total divergence per row: e.g., Screening (LLM: TA-R, RL-C; GT: TA-R, RL-A, OM-I, IT-C); KYC Review (LLM: RL-R only, with note; GT: TA-C, RL-R, OM-A, IT-I); Release (LLM lacks A; GT assigns OM-A); Archive (LLM: IT-R, RL-I; GT: TA-C, RL-I, OM-A, IT-R).
  - No involvement for missing roles (e.g., no Operations Manager equivalents); arbitrary additions in LLM (e.g., IT-C for release without clear source tie) vs. ground truth's broader assignments (e.g., IT-C/I across more tasks).
  - Incomplete accountability: Most LLM rows lack an explicit A, violating standard RACI (one A per task), while ground truth enforces it consistently.

These errors compound to show poor alignment with the source text mapping and ground truth, despite partial adherence to vocabulary. Minor positives (e.g., Markdown format, key legend) add negligible value. Total score reflects ~70% deviation.
