**2.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly used **Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring** exactly as mandated. No disallowed synonyms leaked. However, added activities use unauthorized names/phrasings (e.g., "Escalation (≥70)", "Payment Scheduling").
- **Activities (major violations, -4.0)**: Added 4 extra/renamed activities not matching ground truth ("Escalation (≥70)", "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification"). Failed to use exact GT activities ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). Prompt forbids "rename, merge, or add activities"; does not cover "every activity" accurately. GT has 6 precise activities; LLM has 8 mismatched.
- **RACI assignments (major errors, -3.5)**: Systemic inaccuracies vs. GT:
  | Activity (shared) | Key LLM errors |
  |-------------------|---------------|
  | Intake Vetting   | Front R (missing A); Comp Officer A (wrong, GT none); missing Comp Analyst C. |
  | KYC Review       | Comp Analyst R (missing A); Comp Officer A (GT C); added Front I (GT none); missing Treas I. |
  | AML Screening    | Comp Analyst R (missing A); Comp Officer A (GT C); missing Treas I, Front none in GT but inconsistent. |
  | Risk Scoring     | Missing Front C, Treas I. |
  - Invented RACI for extras entirely wrong/missing (e.g., no low-risk path distinction, wrong Consulted/Informed).
- **Formatting/Table structure (-0.5)**: Markdown table used, but blanks instead of GT's "–"; no bolding on activities/cells; extra "**Key**" section (unrequested, adds explanation).
- **Completeness/Coverage (-0.5)**: Misses roles/nuances (e.g., no low-risk "schedule" vs. escalation; originating analyst notification mishandled); does not fully reflect narrative roles (e.g., Comp Officer only accountable on approval/escalation).

Total reflects ~25% alignment (vocab + basic table); strict penalty for all deviations per instructions.
