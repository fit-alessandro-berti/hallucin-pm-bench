The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the accurate minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), matching the ground truth. However, it lacks the detailed markings after each transition, which are present in the ground truth for clarity and verification. More critically, the explanation contains a factual error: it claims the sequence allows T5 to fire "without T3 ever being enabled," but T3 is enabled (due to the token in P2) immediately after T1 and remains so until T5 consumes the P2 token. This misstates the net's behavior, contradicting the ground truth's accurate note that T3 "has not yet occurred" and is subsequently disabled. Strict evaluation deducts points for this substantive inaccuracy and omission of markings, despite the core response being mostly aligned.
