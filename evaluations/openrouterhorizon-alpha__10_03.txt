4.0

- The LLM answer does rigidly use only the approved vocabulary for activity names—good.
- However, there are major process inaccuracies and RACI missteps:

1. The LLM invents two activities ("Schedule the payment" and "Notify originating analyst") which are not mapped in the ground truth. The ground truth merges the scheduling/release and notification steps into "Release Funds". Adding extra, divided activities violates the instruction to “not add activities”.

2. RACI assignments differ sharply:
   - In Intake Vetting, the ground truth has Front-Office Analyst as both R, A (Responsible + Accountable), but the LLM assigns only R; nobody is marked as Accountable. Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer should not be “I”, and Treasury Ops should be "I" only.
   - For KYC Review, ground truth gives Compliance Analyst both R, A and Compliance Officer as Consulted, but the LLM assigns only R (no A), and Compliance Officer as C.
   - For AML Screening, again, LLM omits A for Compliance Analyst.
   - For Risk Scoring, ground truth makes Compliance Officer Accountable, Compliance Analyst Responsible, and Front-Office Analyst Consulted, none of which is reflected in the LLM answer.
   - For Compliance Officer Approval, LLM splits this into an activity only when the score is over 70, but includes both R and A for Compliance Officer, which is only correct for that split pool, but fails to show clearly.
   - Release Funds is present in both, but the LLM adds an extra "Notify originating analyst" step.
   - In all activities, the distinction between R and A (often conflated) is frequently lost.

3. Use of "I" and "C" is not rigorous: the LLM puts "I" in most cells, but the ground truth often has “–” for not involved.

4. LLM matrix contains more rows than the ground truth: instruction says do not add or split/merge activities. This is a critical error.

Because of these substantive errors (additional activities, incorrect RACIs, not marking “A” where needed, and lack of strict notation for uninvolved roles), only partial credit is possible for use of required vocabulary. Small vocabulary errors would have dropped the score far lower.
