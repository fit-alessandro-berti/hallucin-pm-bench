The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified without synonyms or leaks, which avoids the lowest score. However, it violates the prompt by adding unauthorized activities ("Compliance Officer approval (for scores >70)", "Schedule the payment (for scores ≤70 or after approval)", "Notify originating analyst") and renaming/splitting others (e.g., conditional phrasing in approval, separating "schedule" from "release" where the ground truth merges into "Release Funds"). This constitutes adding, renaming, and potentially merging in violation of instructions. The RACI assignments differ significantly across nearly all cells (e.g., Intake Vetting: R/I vs. R,A/C/–/I; Risk Scoring: I/R/C/I vs. C/R/A/I; no dashes for non-involvement, using I incorrectly; Approval: I/C/A/I vs. I/C/R,A/–; extra rows with no ground truth equivalent). Formatting lacks ground truth's bolding and dash usage. These cumulative errors (structural deviations, incorrect mappings, additions) warrant a near-minimal score under strict evaluation criteria.
