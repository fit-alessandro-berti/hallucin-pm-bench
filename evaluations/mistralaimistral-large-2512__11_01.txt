**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (Perfect: 10/10)**: Top 3 activities correctly identified and ranked by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). All waiting-time figures quoted verbatim (e.g., "36.5h"/"120h" matches table/ground truth intent).
- **No unwarranted content (Perfect: 10/10)**: Strictly limited to these 3 activities, waiting times only—no service times, throughput, or extras.
- **Format & Constraints (9/10)**: Crisp memo ≤150 words (~110 words). Excellent executive headers/subject (enhances "memo" feel vs. ground truth's plain list). Minor deduction for slightly more verbose structure vs. ground truth's ultra-minimalism.
- **Actions (8.5/10)**: All concrete, data-driven (e.g., "historical data shows 30%", "25%"), logically tied to waiting times, explicitly ≥20% cuts. Thematic overlap with ground truth (reminders/batching/prioritization), but non-identical phrasing/details (e.g., LLM's "24h/72h reminders" vs. ground's "24h escalation"; "batch digital dispatch" vs. "e-signature"; prioritization differs). Strictness docks for divergence.
- **Overall**: Near-identical substance; minor stylistic/phrasing diffs prevent 10. Significant strengths in polish outweigh small variances.
