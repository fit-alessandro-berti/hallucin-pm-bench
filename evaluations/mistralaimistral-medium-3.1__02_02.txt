- Q2: Lists the C002 activities in exactly the right order, using "â†’" as separator and with names matching the ground truth.
- Q3: Correctly finds (via explicit tracing) the activities that directly precede "Ship_Order", lists each only once, orders them alphabetically, and does not include extra or missing items.
