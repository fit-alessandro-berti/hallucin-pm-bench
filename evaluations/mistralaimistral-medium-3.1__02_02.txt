The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content and structure for all questions: Q1 is precisely "3"; Q2 provides the identical sequence with correct ordering and separator; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities correctly, one per line and alphabetically ordered (Arrange_Delivery before Check_Stock). No differences, errors, extras, or hallucinations are present, even under strict evaluation. Minor explanatory text in the LLM response does not alter the core answers, which align line-by-line with the ground truth expectations.
