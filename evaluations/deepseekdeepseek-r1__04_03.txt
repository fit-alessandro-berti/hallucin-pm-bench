The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth:

- Correctly answers "No"
- Reviews every rule individually
- References the correct factual justification for each rule (especially identifying Rule 3 violation due to order of Notify_Authorities and Regulatory_Affairs_Review)
- The language and logic match the gold standard

Minor deductions:
- The table in the ground truth provides a little more explicit clarity and separation of the justification.
- The wording of "Satisfied" vs. the slightly more concise bullet list in the LLM answer is marginally less transparent, but this is very minor.

Overall, this is a highly accurate and compliant answer but can lose half a point for slightly less detailed formatting and explicit cross-referencing than the ground truth.
