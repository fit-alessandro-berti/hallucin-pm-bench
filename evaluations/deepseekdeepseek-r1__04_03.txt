The LLM answer correctly identifies non-compliance ("No") due to the exact same Rule 3 violation as the ground truth, with accurate assessments for all rules. Justifications are concise, reference each rule, and align closely in reasoning (e.g., NA before RA completion). Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly stating "once each" for Rule 1 (omitting the "once" frequency requirement, though implied by the trace); (2) bullet-point format vs. ground truth's table, slightly less structured; and (3) phrasing variations (e.g., "both present" vs. "appears once and precedes"). No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes these small imprecisions.
