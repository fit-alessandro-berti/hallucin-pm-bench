2.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Even partial alignments (e.g., use of mandated terms) are outweighed by structural, content, and fidelity errors, each causing significant point deductions:

- **Structure and Format (Major Deduction: -4.0)**: The LLM uses a traditional RACI column format (Task | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed) with full role names in cells and many empty fields. The ground truth transposes this (roles as columns: Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support; R/A/C/I abbreviations in cells), includes a legend, and ensures no empty cells—all intersections are filled. This is not a minor variation; it's a fundamental mismatch in presentation, violating the ground truth's clear organization.

- **Roles and Coverage (Major Deduction: -2.0)**: The LLM omits "Operations Manager" entirely (a key column in ground truth, used for A in most tasks), limiting roles to Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support. While the prompt mandates only specific substitutions (correctly applied by LLM), the ground truth explicitly includes Operations Manager, making the LLM incomplete. Empty cells in Consulted/Informed further differ from ground truth's full coverage.

- **Task Phrasing and Mapping (Moderate Deduction: -1.0)**: Tasks are partially aligned but inconsistently worded and split. E.g., LLM's "Receive and log the customer’s transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM adds a separate "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" (from original step 5) as a distinct task with IT Support R/A, while ground truth folds it into "Release Payment" without explicit mention. "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record" is minor, but the extra task and lack of exact mandated wording (e.g., no bolding of "**KYC Review**" as in ground truth) compound differences. All tasks from the source are covered but not mapped identically.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -3.5)**: Assignments differ in ~80% of cases, even where roles overlap. E.g.:
  - Receive: LLM (TA Responsible, RL Accountable) vs. GT (TA R, RL I, OM A, IT C)—misses OM A and IT C.
  - Screen: Partial match (both TA R, RL A), but GT adds OM I and IT C.
  - KYC Review: LLM (RL Responsible/Accountable, TA Consulted) vs. GT (TA C, RL R, OM A, IT I)—ignores OM A and IT I.
  - Similar mismatches for Approve, Release, and Archive (e.g., Archive: LLM IT R/A, RL Informed; GT IT R, OM A, TA C, RL I).
  This indicates poor fidelity to the ground truth's specific R/A/C/I logic.

- **Mandated Vocabulary and Additional Elements (Minor Deduction: -0.5)**: Correctly uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, and “Transaction Analyst” (partial credit). However, lacks ground truth's bolding for "**KYC Review**", legend, and explanatory notes on mapping/usage. Extra introductory/explanatory text in LLM ("Here is the RACI table...") is not in ground truth.

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness**: ~20-30% alignment (mandated terms, partial task coverage, one matching assignment). No omissions from source, but transformations introduce errors. Small issues (e.g., wording tweaks, no legend) deduct heavily per instructions, yielding a low score. A perfect match would be 10.0; this is far from it.
