4.0

- The LLM answer uses the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"), which is correct and crucial.
- However, there are considerable differences from the ground truth:

1. **Exclusion of "Operations Manager":**  
   The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" entirely as a role in the RACI chart. The prompt does not explicitly mention this role, but the ground truth includes it, and since strictness is required, any missing role that is present in the ground truth is a significant error.

2. **Incorrect Responsibility & Accountability:**  
   - The LLM makes "Regulatory Liaison" Accountable (and sometimes Responsible) for almost everything except the IT-related tasks, while the ground truth allocates "Accountable" to "Operations Manager" (another big omission).
   - For the Transaction Analyst, the LLM incorrectly makes them "Responsible" for logging and screening, but ground truth lists them as "Consulted" for "KYC Review" and "Approve High-Risk transactions", for example—so the mapping is off.

3. **Inconsistent RACI Assignments:**  
   - The LLM does not match the "Consulted" and "Informed" assignments in the ground truth, especially in the IT Support and Regulatory Liaison notification/archival steps.
   - For example, in the archiving step, the ground truth has IT Support as Responsible and Regulatory Liaison as Informed, while the LLM lists IT Support as Responsible/Accountable and Regulatory Liaison as Informed—but doesn't mark "Consulted" where appropriate anywhere for IT Support.

4. **Task Naming & Breakdown:**  
   - The LLM sometimes paraphrases ("Undertake a KYC Review" vs. just "**KYC Review**") instead of strictly following the mandated activity wording, e.g., "Release the approved payment" instead of just "Release Payment", which counts as a small deviation.
   - The tasks are not in precisely the same wording/order as the ground truth.

5. **Legend and Table Structure:**  
   - The ground truth provides a clear legend for R/A/C/I, which the LLM omits (small but material for clarity).
   - The table structure lacks a "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" column header, affecting clarity/mandate adherence.

Given the mandate to be "utmost strict," these errors add up to a high penalty. The enforced vocabulary was followed (which avoids a score below 3), but the RACI allocations, strict terminology, and table scope suffer notable errors. Thus, a score of 4.0 is warranted.
