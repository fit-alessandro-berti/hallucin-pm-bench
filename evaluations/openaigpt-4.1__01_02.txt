### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth, warranting a very low score under strict criteria. The core task requires summarizing **only the actual decision points** (branching or approval gates in the process flow) and listing **every required document** precisely, using exact terminology without introducing extraneous elements.

#### Key Flaws in Decision Points (Major Errors, ~70% Weight):
- **Incorrect scope and invention of decisions**: The ground truth identifies exactly three decision points: (1) Underwriter Alignment Gate (score difference check/escalation), (2) Amount Threshold Decision (amount-based auto-approval or escalation), and (3) Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) (approve/reject vote). These are the true forks in the process flow.
  - The LLM incorrectly expands this to seven items, fabricating "decisions" for non-branching steps like Quick KYC Verification (KYC), Community Impact Assessment (CIA), Dual Underwriter Split, and Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC). For example:
    - KYC and CIA are linear verifications/assessments with no specified branching (proceed/fail) in the process description—LLM invents binary outcomes like "endorse" or "verify successfully," introducing standard loan-like gates not in the prompt.
    - Dual Underwriter Split is preparatory (just assigning scores), not a decision; the actual decision is the subsequent Alignment Gate.
    - NFC is a collection step, not a decision point—LLM adds an invented "assessment" decision.
  - This violates the prompt's emphasis on "exact terminology and flow," bloating the summary with non-decision activities and mimicking a full process outline rather than focusing on decisions.
- **Structural and phrasing issues**: LLM uses a numbered list with sub-bullets, adding verbose descriptions (e.g., "Proceed if yes") that aren't in the ground truth or prompt. It also misplaces Dual Underwriter Split as a decision, diluting the focus on the Alignment Gate.

These errors transform a concise, precise summary into an inaccurate, overextended one, directly contradicting the ground truth's selective identification of branching points.

#### Flaws in Required Documents (Minor Errors, ~30% Weight):
- **Near-match but imprecise phrasing**: The list is mostly correct (all six documents included), but small deviations from ground truth exactness incur point loss per instructions:
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth "(≤ 3 months)"—unnecessary "old" addition.
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"—adds "single" and full spelling, altering brevity.
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"—adds "template," which matches the prompt but exceeds ground truth's minimalism.
- **Omission of contextual note**: Ground truth includes a clarifying note ("No credit bureau report..."), emphasizing the non-standard nature; LLM omits this, missing a key nuance.
- **Header addition**: "at submission time" is accurate (from prompt) but not in ground truth, slightly altering format without justification.

Overall, the documents section is ~80% aligned but loses points for phrasing inconsistencies and lack of the ground truth's exact structure/omissions. Combined with the catastrophic mishandling of decision points, the total score reflects severe non-compliance—small errors compound, but the decision points alone justify near-minimal grading. No credit for structure or completeness, as accuracy to ground truth is paramount.
