3.0

• Added tasks  
The LLM answer lists the correct IDs for the added tasks but omits their names, which is a minor but notable omission based on the level of detail in the ground truth.

• Removed tasks  
The LLM says "(none)", but the ground truth correctly notes that "Send RMA Label" (id = send_rma_label) was removed. This is a significant oversight.

• Gateway type changes  
Correctly identifies the type change and the ID.

Overall, the LLM misses one removed task completely and omits task names, which should have resulted in a large deduction. Additionally, the final commentary is unnecessary per the instructions but does not introduce incorrect facts. Due to missing a major factual difference and lacking full details on added tasks, the score is 3.0.
