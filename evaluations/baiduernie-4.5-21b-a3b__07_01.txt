### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (partial credit, ~2/3 points)**: Correctly identified the two added tasks by ID (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), but failed to use the exact element names from the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code") as required by the prompt. Ground truth includes full names with IDs for clarity and fidelity to XML content. This is a significant omission under strict rules.
- **Removed tasks (0 points)**: Completely incorrectâ€”listed "(none)" despite the clear removal of the "Send RMA Label" task (ID: `send_rma_label`), present in v1 but absent in v2. This is a factual error directly contradicting the XML snippets and ground truth, warranting severe deduction.
- **Gateway type changes (partial credit, ~1/2 points)**: Accurately noted the change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive, but less precise than ground truth (which specifies versions explicitly). Minor formatting difference (e.g., no bolding or version labels).
- **Overall structure and adherence (0 points)**: Used bullet points instead of the implied bolded headings from the prompt/ground truth. Added speculative/explanatory text ("The changes include... Everything else remains unchanged"), violating the "list only the factual differences" and "Do not speculate" instructions. No mention of "No other differences should be reported" as in ground truth.
- **Strictness adjustment**: With utmost strictness, the missed removal is a critical factual error (major point loss), incomplete task naming is a clear violation (significant loss), and extra content/speculation further penalizes. Partial credit only for correctly spotting additions and gateway change prevents a total zero.
