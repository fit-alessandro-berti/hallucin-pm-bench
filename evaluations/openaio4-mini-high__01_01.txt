3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially captures the core elements of the prompt but introduces significant errors, omissions, and deviations from the process description and ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points Summary (Major Deviations, -4.0 points)**: 
  - The ground truth identifies exactly 3 decision points with precise branching logic (eligibility check, amount threshold post-pre-approval, and final payment approval integrating pre-approve/auditor review). The LLM expands this to 5 points, incorrectly splitting integrated elements (e.g., treating Finance_Controller_PreApprove as a standalone financial decision separate from final approval, and inventing a "Payment-Release Gate" that implies an undefined activity not in the process description—violating the "do not introduce" rule). It also adds unsubstantiated decision phrasing (e.g., "meet Contoso’s financial-eligibility criteria" or "pass Contoso’s controls"), which infers beyond the description. Branching outcomes (e.g., rejection paths) are underrepresented or omitted in several points, unlike the ground truth's clear logic.

- **Required Documents List (Significant Omission, -2.0 points)**: 
  - The ground truth lists 7 documents exhaustively, including RefundConfirmationPDF as a required output. The LLM omits RefundConfirmationPDF entirely, listing only 6 and failing to cover the full catalogue (even noting AuditTrail's conditional use, which the LLM handles but incompletely). Assigning documents to specific decisions (e.g., "RefundRequestForm (amount field)" for the threshold) is an unprompted addition that fragments the required separate list and introduces minor artefacts (e.g., implying "amount field" as a document element).

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness (-0.5 points)**: 
  - The response adheres to the non-introduction of legacy activities but otherwise over-interprets (e.g., per-decision documents) and lacks the ground truth's structured table format and exhaustive completeness. Small errors like phrasing inferences and extra granularity compound to show poor alignment, but partial overlap on core decisions/documents prevents a floor score.

This results in a 3.5, reflecting ~50% accuracy with critical flaws in completeness and adherence.
