**7.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Strengths (high alignment, minimal deductions)**: Correctly answers **"Yes"**. Accurately identifies the key mechanism (T2b shortcut bypasses pc/T3 for pd). Provides the **exact prefix** `T1, T2b, T4, T5` (matches GT steps 1-4). Good step-by-step markings (brief but accurate). Solid dependencies analysis.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences, per strict criteria)**:
  - **Sequence mismatch (-1.5)**: Claims `T1, T2b, T4, T5` as "**shortest**" and sufficient proof, but omits T6/T3 (GT's full minimal sequence demonstrating T5 *before* T3 *in the same trace*). Stops prematurely; doesn't show T3 firing after via feedback.
  - **Justification flaw (-0.5)**: Explicitly states "T3 never fired in this sequence" as valid for "before" — contradicts GT's interpretation requiring both in one trace (natural reading of "fire before"; vacuous if T3 absent).
  - **Missing details (-0.3)**: No inline token-move arrows/markings per step (GT format). No explicit lower-bound proof or "no shorter exists" reasoning. Ignores T6 feedback entirely.
  - **Minor formatting/structure (-0.2)**: Less precise (e.g., arrows vs. numbered list; no bold "**Yes —**"; no angle-bracket sequence).
- **Overall**: Strong core logic/path (80%+ match), but critical incompleteness on "shortest sequence achieving order" and proof drops it. Small errors (e.g., no T6 mention) cost ~25% per strictness rule. Not 10.0 (imperfect match); not <5 (fundamentally sound).
