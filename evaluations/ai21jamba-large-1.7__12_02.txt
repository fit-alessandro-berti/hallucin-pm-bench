The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid counter-example from case C003 (lines 6 and 7), with accurate citation and concise justification in one paragraph. However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it omits the additional counter-example in case C005 (line 11, where Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order), which the ground truth explicitly includes as a key proof that Validate_Payment does not "always" follow Receive_Order. This partial coverage of evidence reduces the thoroughness, though minor formatting differences (e.g., backticks vs. italics) are negligible.
