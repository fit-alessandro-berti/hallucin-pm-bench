**1.0**

The LLM answer is not a valid, self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document (no `<?xml>`, no `bpmn:definitions`, no namespaces, fragmented invalid tags like `<bpmn>`, `<start event="Start" gap="0" ul="system">`, `<parallel-group>`, etc.). It includes irrelevant internal monologue, multiple incomplete/invalid snippets, and no proper structure. All required elements are missing or wrong: no start event, no exclusive gateways (step 2/3), no parallel split/join, no verbatim tasks (e.g., "Validate the claim", loop with "Request missing information", "checks warranty eligibility" implied but absent, parallel "Create shipment order"/"Schedule courier pickup", "update inventory records"/"close the claim"), no sequence flows, inconsistent/missing "wrc_" ID prefixes, not exactly two end events. Complete deviation from ground truth semantics, format, and prompt constraints.
