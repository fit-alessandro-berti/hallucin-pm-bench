The LLM answer correctly identifies all three concurrent task sets from Process B with exact task names and structure, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it includes extraneous introductory and explanatory text (e.g., referencing parallel blocks P1/P2/P3 and additional descriptive prose), which deviates from the prompt's strict instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" without any additional content. This formatting and content excess warrants a deduction under utmost strictness for non-exact adherence.
