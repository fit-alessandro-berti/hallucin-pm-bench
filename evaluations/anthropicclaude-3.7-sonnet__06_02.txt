The LLM answer correctly enumerates all and only the sets of concurrent tasks (parallel blocks) from Process B, formats them precisely as requested, includes only tasks from Process B, numbers each line, and avoids mentioning sequential tasks or tasks from Processes A or C. There are no errors or omissions compared to the ground truth.
