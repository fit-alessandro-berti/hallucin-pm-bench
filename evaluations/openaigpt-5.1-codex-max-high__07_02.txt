9.0

The LLM answer is factually perfect, correctly identifying all added tasks (3), the removed task (1), and the exact gateway type change (exclusive to inclusive) with no extras or misses, adhering strictly to the prompt's required headings (including the "(e.g., ...)" phrasing). No analysis of ignored elements like renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name change).

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Format mismatches** (-0.5): Bullets (-) vs. numbered lists (1., 2., etc.); task names not bolded (**Verify Identity** etc.); gateway ID uses backticks (`) vs. escaped underscore (Gateway\_Decision); headings use plain **bold** vs. * ** (minor markdown variance).
- **Content detail gaps** (-0.3): Gateway description lacks "(XOR)" / "(OR)" abbreviations, explicit "*v1*" / "*v2*" references, and phrasing "changed from ... to ..."; no final confirmatory note "(No other ... present.)"; no top "## **Expected Answer Key**" header.
- **Minor structural** (-0.2): Unordered bullets imply less precision than numbered; removed section lacks plural consistency with "1." numbering.

These small differences (formatting/detail omissions) warrant deduction per instructions, but excellence in core accuracy limits loss.
