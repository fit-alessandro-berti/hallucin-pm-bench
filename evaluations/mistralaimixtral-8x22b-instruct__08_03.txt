**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth)
- **Correctness of "Yes"**: Matches (+1.0 base).
- **Core Error on Sequence**: LLM provides a 4-step sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) *without T3 firing at all*, claiming it shows "T5 before T3 (since T3 never fired)". This is invalid—demonstrating "T5 fires *before* T3" requires a sequence containing *both* transitions with T5 preceding T3 (standard in Petri net firing sequence analysis for ordering). Ground truth correctly uses T6 to enable T3 *after* T5 (T1, T2b, T4, T5, **T6, T3**). LLM ignores feedback loop entirely (-3.0).
- **Shortest Sequence Mismatch**: LLM claims 4 steps is shortest; ground truth proves 6 is minimal *for achieving the order* (explains lower bound of 4 to reach T5, +2 more for T3 post-T5 via T6). LLM's is too short/wrong (-1.0).
- **Explanation Differences**: LLM's analysis explores paths well but stops short, no markings per step, no "why it works" using shortcut + loop. Ground truth has precise step-by-step markings, compact syntax, lower-bound proof, and loop explanation (-1.0).
- **Format/Completeness**: LLM verbose with unnecessary branches/alternatives (e.g., T1/T4/T2b/T5); ground truth concise, numbered list with markings and arrow "← T5 fired before T3". Final answer mismatched (-0.5). No T6/T3 mention (-0.5).

Total: Starts at 10, deducts for all differences/errors = 4.0. Minor positives (spotting T2b) don't offset major failures under "utmost strictness".
