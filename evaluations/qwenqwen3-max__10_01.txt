The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without forbidden variants, matching the vocabulary policy and appearing in the rubric's correctness criteria. It also adheres to "unwarranted content" by sticking to the provided activities and roles without additions. The structure is a clear RACI matrix with activities as rows and roles as columns, and it assigns exactly one Responsible (R) per activity, aligning with the narrative's performers (e.g., AM for Receive Application, CO for KYC Review).

However, significant deductions are warranted for RACI allocation differences from the ground truth, evaluated strictly per the instructions and rubric. The LLM uses a simplistic binary (R or –/not involved), omitting Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) roles that are present in nearly every row of the ground truth (e.g., AM as A in KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, and Notify Customer; multiple C/I assignments like CO as C in Receive Application and Order Vetting). This results in most cells being incorrectly marked as – instead of A/C/I, failing to "reflect the narrative" fully as per the rubric's emphasis on Account Manager accountability "where appropriate" and the expected detailed RACI inference. No legend mismatch is penalized heavily, but the overall incompleteness and per-cell discrepancies (e.g., Record Update lacks AM C, FC C, CO I) represent major errors, not minor ones, justifying a low score despite partial alignment.
