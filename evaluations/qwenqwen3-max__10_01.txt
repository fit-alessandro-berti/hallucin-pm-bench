The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without any forbidden variants, and it structures a basic matrix with the right activities and no extraneous content. However, it severely underdelivers on RACI completeness: it only assigns single "R" roles per activity (which loosely align with the narrative's "handled by/performed by" assignments) but omits all "A" (Accountable), "C" (Consulted), and "I" (Informed) designations, leaving most cells blankâ€”directly contradicting the ground truth's detailed allocations. This simplifies the matrix into a mere responsibility list rather than a full RACI, failing to reflect implied process interactions (e.g., Account Manager as "R/A" or "A" in multiple steps, and widespread "C"/"I" for other roles). Column headers use abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) instead of full names, introducing a mismatch. These are not minor errors; the core RACI assignments differ substantially across all rows, warranting a low score despite terminology accuracy.
