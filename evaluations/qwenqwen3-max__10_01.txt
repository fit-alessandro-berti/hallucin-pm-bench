4.0

- Strengths:
  - The LLM answer correctly uses all three required terms: "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance".
  - The forbidden terms never appear.
  - No extra activities or roles are added; roles match abbreviations from prompt.

- Errors (Justifying the major deduction):
  1. **RACI detail is incorrect:**
     - The LLM answer only uses "R" (Responsible) and omits all other RACI roles ("A" - Accountable, "C" - Consulted, "I" - Informed), which the ground-truth matrix applies in detail across all activities and roles.
     - Particularly, responsibility/accountability sharing ("R/A") is missed throughout.
     - Other roles (C/I) are unassigned, contrary to the ground truth.
  2. **Role column headers use only abbreviations** ("AM", etc.), whereas the ground truth shows full role names ("Account Manager", etc.), which is stricter per instructions and the example.
  3. **Formatting:** The answer omits the exact capitalization of activity names (mostly ok here), but doesn't bold the synonyms as the ground truth does.
  4. **Responsibility assignment doesn't accurately reflect narrative:** In several rows, the activity is assigned only "R" to the performing role, while in reality, *Account Manager* is often both responsible AND accountable, and various roles should be consulted or informed.

- The required terminology is strictly followed (no forbidden synonyms appear), **but the RACI assignment lacks required detail, accuracy, and completeness, which is a severe flaw for a RACI matrix task.** These are not "small" errors, so the score must reflect that.

**Overall: The correct terminology is a major plus, but incorrect/incomplete RACI and role details result in significant point deduction.**
