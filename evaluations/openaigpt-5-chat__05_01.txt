The LLM answer correctly identifies the need for a boundary timer event and a direct flow to Task_Triage to enforce the SLA by bypassing delays, without adding tasks. It references relevant IDs and stays concise. However, it deducts significant points for major flaws: (1) incorrect placement on Task_RequestDocs (timer would start late, only on the incomplete path, failing to measure 48 hours from submission for all claims); (2) lacks "interrupting" specification (essential for auto-escalation bypass); (3) no XML-like duration detail (e.g., PT48H); (4) "intermediate" timer phrasing is imprecise for a boundary event. These errors prevent reliable SLA compliance, diverging substantially from the ground truth's effective design on Task_Receive.
