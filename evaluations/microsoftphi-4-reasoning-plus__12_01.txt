The LLM answer correctly identifies the key inaccuracies across all three cases (reversal in 1001 and 1003, absence in 1002) and aligns with the ground truth's core evidence, but it loses significant points for excessive verbosity, repetitive internal reasoning (e.g., multiple reformulations instead of a direct, short response), and minor errors/phrasing issues (e.g., "Audit activities" instead of "Quality_Check"; confusing "not directly preceding Authorize" when the claim is about preceding Update_Inventory). The ground truth is concise, structured, and precisely worded; this feels like unedited stream-of-consciousness rather than a polished analyst's justification.
