5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates reasonable effort at vocabulary compliance and tasks mapping, but significant and numerous deviations from the ground truth require a strict deduction:

**Strengths:**
- It consistently uses the mandated terms (*KYC Review*, *Regulatory Liaison*, *Transaction Analyst*) without forbidden synonyms.
- IT Support is used (as in the source), which is acceptable as it isn't replaced by vocabulary mandates.

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Missing Role:**
   - The ground truth introduces an *Operations Manager* as the **Accountable** party for every task. The LLM answer omits this crucial role entirely, failing a key part of RACI: assigning accountability.
2. **RACI Assignments:**
   - The LLM assigns *Responsible* and *Accountable* to the same role for almost every activity, violating RACI best practices and diverging from the ground truth—where A is always Operations Manager and R rotates.
   - Consulted and Informed columns are typically left blank or used differently compared to the ground truth, e.g., not informing Regulatory Liaison for KYC Review or Approve step, etc.
3. **Task Framing and Activity Mapping:**
   - Tasks are broken out into more granular steps (e.g., “Post-archive notification...” as a separate task) that are not present in the ground truth, causing structural drift.
   - The formal names for activities are not strictly matched to the ground truth (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" rather than “Receive Payment Instruction”).
   - The LLM introduces “Post-archive notification” as a stand-alone task, which is a passive case and not in the core process table.
4. **Table Structure/Legend:**
   - The LLM omits a clear legend for R/A/C/I (minor, but in a process document this is important).
   - The RACI design omits all ground truth columns (‘Operations Manager’) and does not cross-verify each participant for each activity.

**Summary:**  
- Vocabulary is mostly compliant, but the mapping of roles, accountability, and the task structure deviate materially from the ground truth mandates.
- Especially critical: missing “Operations Manager” and incorrect R/A mappings for nearly all tasks.
- Thus, while the attempt is clear and syntax is clean, these faults require a strict downgrade; this is approximately halfway between “failure to meet requirements” (which would be ~3.0–4.0) and “adequate but with significant errors” territory.
