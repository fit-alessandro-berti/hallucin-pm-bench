1.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, resulting in a near-minimum score. Even minor discrepancies (e.g., task phrasing, empty cells) compound to major losses, as they alter the table's fidelity, completeness, and alignment. Key differences:

- **Structure and Format (Major Loss: -4.0 points)**: 
  - LLM uses a row-per-task format with dedicated columns for R, A, C, I (populated with role names or dashes). Ground truth uses columns for roles (including an unmentioned "Operations Manager") with R/A/C/I letters in cells, plus a separate legend. This is not equivalent; the lack of legend and different layout (no role-column focus) misaligns entirely. Markdown is used correctly, but format mismatch is a fundamental error.

- **Roles and Coverage (Major Loss: -2.5 points)**: 
  - LLM limits roles to mandated terms (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison) + source-mentioned IT Support, omitting "Operations Manager" (present in ground truth as the primary Accountable role). This violates alignment, as ground truth distributes accountability to OM across all tasks. LLM's self-assignment of R&A to single roles (e.g., no distributed C/I) ignores ground truth's balanced RACI (e.g., OM as A everywhere, extensive C/I usage). Empty Consulted columns in LLM contrast with ground truth's populated C/I, leaving tasks incomplete.

- **Task Breakdown and Phrasing (Major Loss: -1.5 points)**: 
  - LLM expands to 8 tasks (adding granular splits like "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and "Post-archive notification"), exceeding ground truth's 6 consolidated tasks. This over-interprets the source, introducing extras not in ground truth (e.g., task 6-8 vs. single "Archive Record"). Phrasing differs: LLM retains source details (e.g., "transfer instruction," "sender and beneficiary") while ground truth simplifies/alters (e.g., "Payment Instruction," no "sender and beneficiary"). Small errors like "high-risk transaction" (singular) vs. ground truth's plural, or "case file" implied but not used, deduct further. Notification is explicit in LLM but buried in ground truth's Informed—still a mismatch.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Loss: -0.5 points, despite partial overlap)**: 
  - Assignments rarely match. E.g., "KYC Review": LLM has Regulatory Liaison R&A (others empty); ground truth has Regulatory Liaison R, Operations Manager A, Transaction Analyst C, IT Support I. Similar mismatches everywhere (e.g., no IT C for "Receive" in LLM). Only superficial overlaps like Transaction Analyst as R for screening. This core RACI purpose fails alignment.

- **Additional Elements (Minor Loss: -0.5 points)**: 
  - LLM's notes explain dependencies/vocabulary but diverge from ground truth's concise note on synonyms/mapping. No legend in LLM (unlike ground truth) reduces clarity.

**Vocabulary Compliance (No Loss: +1.0 partial credit)**: Both use mandated terms exactly ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") without forbidden ones, covering source tasks. This is the only strong match, preventing a 1.0 floor score. However, it cannot offset the overwhelming structural/content gaps. Total deviations justify 1.5—barely passing as a table but fundamentally unfaithful.
