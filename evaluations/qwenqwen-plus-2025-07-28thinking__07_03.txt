The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with exact IDs, names, and change descriptions matching the ground truth. However, it omits the bullet points (-) used in the ground truth for all list items, resulting in a plain line format instead of bulleted lists; additionally, the ground truth includes alignment spacing in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel"), which is absent. These are minor formatting discrepancies but warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria for not fully replicating the ground truth structure.
