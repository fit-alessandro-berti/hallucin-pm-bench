8.0

The LLM answer correctly lists all the verifiable differences in the correct sections and does not include any commentary or unchanged elements. However, it introduces two notable formatting errors compared to the ground truth:

1. **Missing Hyphens:** The LLM answer omits the leading hyphen for each item (e.g., "- Task_FraudCheck...") that are present in the ground truth answer. According to the prompt, differences—even small ones—should result in a significant deduction.
2. **Spacing in GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES:** The LLM answer does not match the whitespace of the ground truth. For example, "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" instead of "- Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel".

Because these are presentational errors, with the factual content being correct, the answer is close to but not fully matching the ground truth and should not receive full marks. Therefore, an 8.0 is warranted for strict evaluation.
