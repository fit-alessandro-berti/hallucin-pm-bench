8.0

The LLM's answer correctly identifies that the fact is inaccurate and provides per-case discussion, referencing specific case IDs and activity orders. 

Strengths:
- Clear conclusion rejecting the claim.
- Specific evidence cited from all three cases.
- Provides correct sequencing for Case 1001 and Case 1003.
- Notes the absence of Update_Inventory in Case 1002.

Weaknesses causing point deductions:
- It claims in Case 1003: "the sequence is: Inspect_Item -> Update_Inventory -> Quality_Check -> Authorize_Refund," which is correct, but it could be more explicit that Authorize_Refund comes *after* Update_Inventory, not before; the answer lacks explicit mention that in NO case does Authorize_Refund immediately precede Update_Inventory.
- It says, “the sequence cannot be established” for Case 1002, when it could be stricter, as the ground truth does, by saying that "always" is already disproved by Update_Inventory's absence.
- The LLM answer could be slightly clearer in directly stating that in NO case does the claimed ordering (Authorize_Refund -> Update_Inventory) appear.

Overall, the answer is strong and fundamentally correct, but a few missing explicitness and slightly soft phrasing drop it two points.
