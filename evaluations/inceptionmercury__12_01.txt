9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying the fact as false/inaccurate, covering all three cases, and providing evidence-based sequences that demonstrate the reversed or absent ordering, directly negating the "always immediately before" claim. It ties evidence to the conclusion effectively without fabrication or omission of data.

Minor deductions (-1.0 point) for:
- Slightly weaker phrasing in Case 1002 ("sequence cannot be established" implies neutrality rather than explicitly stating it disproves "always," as in ground truth).
- Lacking explicit mention of "reversed" ordering or line citations for precision, though case/activity sequences suffice per prompt and still convey the error clearly.
- No structural bolding or "verdict" header, making it less formatted than ground truth, though content remains concise and on-point.

No larger errors; full marks would require identical phrasing, structure, and explicit disproof ties.
