**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it declares "Yes" (compliant) instead of "No", failing to identify the clear violation of Rule 3 (NA occurs immediately after QE but before RA). Justification erroneously claims Rule 3 is met despite the trace order `<..., Quality_Engineer_Review, Notify_Authorities, Regulatory_Affairs_Review, ...>`. Additional flaws include typo "NP" (should be NA), incomplete Rule 4 reasoning (ignores explicit NA/VP precondition), and overly affirmative phrasing ignoring the violation. All core elements mismatch ground truth.
