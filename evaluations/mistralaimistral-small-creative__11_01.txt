**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Major error in core requirement (60% penalty)**: Incorrect identification of #3 worst activity by avg waiting time. LLM ranks **Initial_Screening** (2.1h avg, correct numbers but **not top 3**). Ground truth and table confirm: #1 **Request_Documents** (36.5h), #2 **Send_Closure_Letter** (12.2h), #3 **Assess_Liability** (7.8h). This violates "three worst-performing activities, strictly by waiting-time" – only 2/3 correct.
- **Actions (20% penalty)**: Plausible and claim ≥20% cuts, but differ entirely from ground truth (no pilots/estimates cited; LLM invents "30%+", "25%", "22%" without data support, contra scoring notes on "unsupported data").
- **Format & extras (10% penalty)**: Professional memo ≤150 words (149), no service/throughput mentions, quotes numbers verbatim for listed activities. But adds headers/"Impact"/"ROI" not in ground truth; less crisp.
- **Minor positives (offset negligible under strictness)**: Top 2 activities/numbers exact; no unwarranted content.

Total differences too substantial for >3.0; fails primary task accuracy.
