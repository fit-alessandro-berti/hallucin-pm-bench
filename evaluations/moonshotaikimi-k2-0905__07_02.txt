The LLM answer accurately identifies and lists all required changes under the exact headings, matching the core content (added tasks: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject; removed: Reject Loan; gateway: Exclusive to Inclusive for Gateway_Decision). Minor deductions for lacking XML IDs (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity`), less descriptive gateway phrasing (omits "XOR"/"OR" and explicit v1/v2 references), absence of the confirmatory note, and plainer formatting (bullets vs. numbered/bold lists)â€”these are small but notable omissions per strict evaluation criteria.
