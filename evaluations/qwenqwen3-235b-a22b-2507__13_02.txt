**9.0**

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth:

**1.** Correctly states 1 occurrence — perfect.  
**2a.** Correctly computes 2.08% (out of 48 events).  
**2b.** Correctly computes 8.33% (out of 12 cases).  
**3.** The explanation meets the intent of the ground truth: it describes that a single case can distort metrics and models if generalized. It mentions overfitting and bias, touches on generalization issues, though could have covered the point about variance/instability and confidence more explicitly (the ground truth mentions "vulnerable to noise", "skew averages", "wide confidence intervals"), but the LLM focuses on bias and misrepresentation.

**Reason for -1 point:**  
The explanation, while valid, is not as complete or technically precise as the model answer—specifically, it lacks explicit points about instability/variance and the effect of noise/confidence intervals. For utmost strictness, this is sufficient cause to deduct 1 point.

**Summary:** All deterministic tasks are perfectly handled; the explanation is good, but not quite as strong as required for a perfect score.
