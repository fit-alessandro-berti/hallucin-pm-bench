The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth for questions 1 and 2, including exact counts, calculations, and percentages rounded to two decimals. For question 3, the response adheres strictly to the â‰¤100-word limit (68 words), explicitly mentions the single occurrence (1 of 12 cases), addresses variance/instability through references to distortion, overfitting, and unrepresentativeness leading to bias, and cautions against over-generalization in performance/predictive analyses. No errors or deviations; it fully satisfies the required criteria without invention.
