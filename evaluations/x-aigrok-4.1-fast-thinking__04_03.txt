The LLM answer is factually correct (correctly identifies "No" compliance, accurately assesses all 4 rules with the precise violation in Rule 3 matching the trace: NA after QE but before RA), but loses points for stylistic and structural differences from the ground truth: bullet list instead of table; lacks ✔/❌ symbols, explicit "Severity is High" in Rule 2 reasoning, bolded emphasis on "before RA is completed" and rule quote in Rule 3, parenthetical clarification in Rule 4, and final "Because..." summary sentence. These are small but notable deviations under strict evaluation, warranting a minor deduction from perfection.
