**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Major functional error (-3.0)**: Uses `cancelActivity="false"` (non-interrupting), allowing the task to overrun the 48h SLA without cancellation/escalation enforcement; ground truth correctly uses `cancelActivity="true"` (interrupting) to strictly enforce by canceling overdue task.
- **Format violations (-1.5)**: Adds unrequested headings ("## SLA-Compliance Improvement", "### Changed/Added XML Elements"), unnecessary "replace" of existing `serviceTask` (empty/identical repeat), violating "Return **only** the changed or added XML elements".
- **XML differences (-0.8)**: Extra unnecessary `id="TimerDef_01"` on `timerEventDefinition`; different IDs/names (`Timer_SLA_48h`/`Flow_09` vs `Boundary_LateCreate`/`Flow_LateEscalation`); different comment style.
- **Justification differences (-0.5)**: Longer, specifies incorrect "non-interrupting", adds "previously unused"/"escalation task"/"48-hour policy" not in ground truth.
Core idea (timer on `Activity_CreateAccount`, PT48H, route to existing `Activity_AMReview`) partially matches (+4.2 base), but strict deduction for all mismatches yields 4.2.
