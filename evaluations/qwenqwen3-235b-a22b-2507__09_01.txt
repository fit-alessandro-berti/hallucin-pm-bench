The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly stating that the value cannot be derived/computed due to the absence of timestamps or durations in the log, and it provides a clear, logical explanation without fabricating any data. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; inclusion of case listings and benchmark details not in ground truth, which adds unnecessary but non-contradictory length) and for not explicitly warning against fabrication, per strict evaluation criteria.
