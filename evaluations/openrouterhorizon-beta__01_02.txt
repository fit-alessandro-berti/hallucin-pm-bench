### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer captures the core decision points and required documents but has several notable differences from the ground truth, warranting a moderate score under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include:

#### Decision Points (major section, ~60% weight):
- **Completeness and Context**: All three decision points are identified correctly (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval), but the LLM omits critical contextual details from the ground truth, such as "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for the first point and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for the second. This reduces the summary's precision regarding the process flow, a key aspect of the prompt's emphasis on exact terminology and sequence.
- **Phrasing Accuracy**: Minor but strict-worthy variances, e.g., "proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" vs. ground truth's "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval"; "continue to step 6" is retained but lacks the implied flow integration. Capitalization in the MBA vote ("approve or reject" vs. "Approve or Reject") is a small error but deducts points per strictness rule.
- **Structure**: Lacks the ground truth's header ("#### Decision points"), bolding, and concise bullet-style conditions (e.g., "⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate"), making it less organized and direct.
- These omissions and phrasings create moderate differences, as the summary feels less tied to the defined process flow.

#### Required Documents (minor section, ~40% weight):
- **Completeness**: All six documents are listed accurately, matching the prompt's original details without introducing extraneous terms—strong here.
- **Phrasing and Details**: Small but penalized errors include:
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. "≤ 3 months" (extra "old").
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "Latest Income Statement (pay-stub/tax slip)" (adds "single"; ground truth simplifies).
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (adds "template").
  These are minor rephrasings but reflect deviations from the ground truth's exact wording.
- **Structure and Additions**: No numbering (ground truth uses 1–6); lacks the "(complete list)" label and the closing note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), which reinforces the prompt's "no standard terminology" rule. This makes the list feel incomplete compared to the ground truth.

Overall, the answer is functionally correct and adheres to the prompt's "exact activity names" rule (no standard loan terms introduced), but the cumulative small-to-moderate differences in context, phrasing, structure, and completeness (especially missing flow positions and the disclaimer note) justify a score below 7.0. No major factual errors, but strictness demands significant deduction for imperfect alignment.
