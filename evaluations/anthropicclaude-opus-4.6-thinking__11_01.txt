The LLM answer excels in correctness (exact activities ranked by avg waiting time, verbatim table quotes for both metrics), zero unwarranted content (no service times, other activities, or throughput), and relevant actions (concrete, logically tied to waits, each explicitly promising ≥20% cut without fabricating unprompted data like "pilot tests"). Memo is crisp (128 words), professional format enhances executive suitability.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Stylistic differences vs. ground truth's bare list (e.g., added header/footer/signature—plausible but divergent; bolding absent).
- Non-matching action phrasings/details (e.g., "portal/SMS" vs. "reminders/escalation"; similar intent but not identical—strict loss despite both valid).
- "95th pctl" abbreviation vs. ground truth "p95" (-0.1 nitpick).

Strict but not punitive; core fidelity near-perfect.
