### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content Accuracy (Major Deduction)**: The LLM answer incorrectly includes "Book_Courier — Pack_Items", a pair explicitly from Process A, despite the prompt's clear instruction to "Ignore Process A entirely" and refer "only to the process explicitly asked for." This is a fundamental error, confusing the two processes as warned. It correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"), but the inclusion of the extraneous wrong pair pollutes the response and violates the task. The self-aware note admits the mistake but fails to excise the error, treating it as part of the output. Ground truth has exactly two pairs with no extras—any deviation here warrants severe penalty under strict criteria.
- **Alphabetical Order (Minor Issue, but Deducted)**: The correct pairs are listed in alphabetical order (Create_Documentation before Procure_Materials), and within-pair sorting is correct (e.g., Create_Documentation before Quality_Check). However, the inserted wrong pair disrupts the overall list's integrity.
- **Output Format (Significant Deduction)**: The prompt requires "one pair per line" in the exact format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (with spaces around the em dash), with no additional text. The LLM uses bullet points ("-"), introductory sentence, bolding (**Process B**), and a explanatory note—none of which match. Ground truth is clean and precise. Even small formatting deviations (e.g., no backticks needed, but exact spacing and no extras) count as errors per instructions.
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the core content error (mixing processes) alone drops this below 5.0, as it shows failure to follow the prompt's highest-priority rule. Partial correctness on the two pairs prevents a 1.0, but format and extras further degrade it. No rationale is provided in the LLM answer, unlike ground truth, adding to incompleteness.
