**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Activity count and naming violations (major deduction: -4.0)**: LLM adds unauthorized activities ("Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release & Notification") and splits/merges differently vs. ground truth's exact 6 activities ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring", "Compliance Officer Approval", "**Release Funds**"). Prompt forbids "rename, merge, or add activities". This alone warrants near-failure.
- **RACI mismatches (major deduction: -2.5)**: ~70% of cells differ (e.g., Intake Vetting: CA "I" vs. "C", TO "–" vs. "I"; KYC Review: FO "C" vs. "–", CA "R" vs. "**R, A**", CO "A" vs. "C", TO "–" vs. "I"; AML Screening: similar pattern; Risk Scoring: FO "–" vs. "C"; Approval: TO "I" vs. "–"; no match for "**Release Funds**" row). Partial similarities (e.g., some "R" or "A") do not excuse errors under "utmost strictness".
- **Formatting inconsistencies (moderate deduction: -0.8)**: No **bolds** on activities/RACI (GT uses them); "/" vs. ", " (e.g., "R / A" vs. "**R, A**"); centered columns vs. left-aligned; minor header diffs.
- **Extra content violation (moderate deduction: -0.5)**: Adds unauthorized "Reading notes" section; prompt specifies "Return the matrix as a Markdown table" only.
- **Positives (minor credit: +0.8)**: Correctly uses exact mandated vocabulary ("Intake Vetting", etc.) without leaks; covers all roles; no disallowed synonyms.
- **Total**: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 2.0 for cumulative failures. Small errors (e.g., formatting, partial RACI) amplify losses per instructions.
