**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Line-by-Line Comparison)
- **Major Hallucinations/Inventions (fatal, -5.0+ deduction)**: Added unmentioned tasks `"Submit Ticket"` (t1), `"Close Ticket"` (t8), and duplicate `"Resolve Issue"` (t6b for specialist). Ground truth has **exactly 6 tasks**: Auto-Classification, Provide Reset Instructions, Initial Diagnosis, Resolve Issue (*shared*), Forward to Specialist, Confirm with Customer. No submit/close activities (start/end events instead). Violates "Do not invent ... activities".
- **Structural Errors (-1.5)**: StartEvent `t0` → invented Submit task (wrong; ground truth: named StartEvent `"Ticket Submitted"` → direct to classification). EndEvent `t9` unnamed → invented Close task (wrong; ground truth: named `"Ticket Closed"`). Specialist path splits `"Resolve Issue"` into 2 tasks (wrong; ground truth reuses single `t4`).
- **Naming/Detail Mismatches (-1.0)**: `"Classify Ticket"` vs `"Auto-Classification"`. No gateway names (e.g., `"Password Reset?"`). Missing `<?xml>`, `targetNamespace`, `process name`, `isExecutable`. Flow names incomplete (only 1 vs. conditions).
- **Missing Elements (-0.5)**: No `<conditionExpression>` (e.g., `yes`/`no` on flows; ground truth has 6).
- **Partial Credits (+1.0 total)**: Core loop (gw3 no → Initial Diagnosis) correct. 3 exclusive gateways (despite prompt saying "two"). Password Reset branch ok. Flow connectivity mostly intact. ≤40 lines, concise IDs, single `<definitions>`.

**Overall**: ~70% structural/logic match but disqualifying inventions make it invalid vs. ground truth. Unmitigated trap failure.
