6.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict criteria applied):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact three worst activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) in same order, accurately quantifies SLA excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) using throughput vs. target data. Structure is memo-like with subject/To, uses bullets for recommendations only (numbered list for activities is close but not identical). No extraneous inventions like ground truth's "Loan-Origination", "April 2025", incorrect "4 805 cases", or "35%" projection. Recs loosely data-derived (e.g., 33% = exact reduction needed for Legal: 900→600).
- **Major deductions (-2.0)**: Fails to explicitly ground "jointly on SLA breaches **and** high waiting time" by omitting waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s) in identification—ground truth lists them to justify selection; this is a core prompt requirement, ungrounded claim.
- **Significant deductions (-1.0)**: Recommendations completely differ in content/text (invented tools like "AI-driven", "API" vs. ground truth's "pre-checks", "add analyst", "€25k heuristic"); while both invent, zero match loses all similarity points despite being "concrete". Violates "ground every sentence in data; do NOT invent" equally but differs from ground truth.
- **Minor deductions (-0.3 each, total -0.6)**: Missing "From" header, waiting times; extra ungrounded closing ("customer experience"); numbered vs. bold for activities (violates "bullet points **only** for recs" spirit); shorter (~110 words vs. ~150); inconsistent "s" abbreviation vs. full "seconds".
- **Overall**: ~65% content match on key ID/quant but critical gaps in justification, recs mismatch, and details yield 6.2 (strict: even small ungrounded elements cost dearly).
