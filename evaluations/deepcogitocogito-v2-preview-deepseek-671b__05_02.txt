9.0

The LLM answer identifies and applies the correct modification—reducing the due date of "Collect Equipment" from P5D to P2D—matching exactly the diff in the ground truth. The rationale is also clear and serves the required purpose.

However, there are a few points leading to minor but significant markdown:
- The diff is provided with additional context lines and an unnecessary explanation of the process flow.
- The rationale, while reasonable, is wordier than necessary and references implementation proposals (e.g., “Strategic pre-staging...”), whereas the ground truth keeps its rationale strictly focused on compliance to the 3-day SLA.
- According to instructions, **even small differences** should reflect in the score.

Overall, the change itself is correct, but minor differences in rationale brevity and unnecessary process calculation details cause a small deduction.
