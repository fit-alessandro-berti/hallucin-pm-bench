4.5

### Evaluation Notes
- **Core Proposal Match (High Marks)**: The LLM correctly identifies and implements the exact same improvement (changing `camunda:dueDate` of "Task_CollectEquipment" from "P5D" to "P2D"), which aligns perfectly with the ground truth. This is the primary goal, so it avoids a total failure score.
- **Diff Format (Significant Deduction)**: The diff is a valid unified diff showing the change, but it includes unnecessary multi-line context (e.g., adjacent `<sequenceFlow>` and other elements, with line numbers `-13,7 +13,7`), violating the "single hunk" requirement for minimalism. Ground truth uses a concise single-hunk format with no extra lines or numbers, making this a clear format error (-2.5 points).
- **Rationale (Major Deduction)**: While one sentence, it deviates substantially: introduces unsubstantiated details (e.g., "Strategic pre-staging," "digital pre-check," "maintaining work quality") not in ground truth, omits the key "3-day SLA" reference, and focuses on general improvement rather than the specific cycle-time justification. This adds fluff and alters meaning (-3.0 points).
- **Overall Structure (Severe Deduction)**: The response includes lengthy pre-diff analysis/reasoning text, directly contravening the required output format of *only* (1) diff and (2) one-sentence rationale. This extraneous content (e.g., process analysis, total time calculation, option evaluation) treats the response as a full explanation rather than strict adherence (-3.0 points total across issues, but core match prevents bottom score).
- **Strictness Applied**: Even minor extras (e.g., rationale wording, diff context) compound with structural violations for a mid-low score; perfect format adherence would be essential for 8+.

The LLM answer is functionally correct but fails on precision, brevity, and format fidelity, warranting this strict penalty.
