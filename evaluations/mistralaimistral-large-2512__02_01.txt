The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 (identical values). For Q5, it correctly identifies three activities ("Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") but erroneously includes an extra "Quality_Check", which appears as the first event in case C-77. This is a clear factual error (failing to reconstruct per-case sequences by sorting timestamps), violating the "only use facts directly from the event-log fragment" rule. Under utmost strictness, this single but significant difference (wrong list content and length) deducts substantially from perfection, but the majority accuracy limits deeper penalty. JSON schema, format, and types are otherwise correct; unsorted list is allowed.
