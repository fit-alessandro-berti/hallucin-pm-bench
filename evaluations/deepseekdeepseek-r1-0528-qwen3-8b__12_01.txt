7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a solid overall conclusion that no cases show "Authorize_Refund" immediately before "Update_Inventory." It accurately highlights the reversed order in Case 1003 and implicitly disproves the sequence in Cases 1001 and 1002 by describing what follows "Authorize_Refund." However, under strict evaluation criteria, it loses significant points (deducting ~2.5 total) for key differences from the ground truth:

- **Incomplete coverage of Case 1001**: The LLM only notes what follows "Authorize_Refund" (Refund_Issued) but fails to explicitly state the reversed order (Update_Inventory occurs *before* Authorize_Refund), unlike the ground truth's clear evidence (with line citation).
- **Incomplete coverage of Case 1002**: The LLM implies the absence by sequence but does not explicitly state that "Update_Inventory" never appears, which directly disproves "always" (as in ground truth). This is a small but notable omission.
- **Lack of specificity**: No line citations or direct phrasing like "reversed ordering" or "disproves 'always'," making the justification less evidence-based and precise compared to the ground truth.
- Strengths (preserving some points): Correct verdict, good use of case IDs, and accurate final summary. No factual errors or inventions.

Overall, the answer is mostly aligned but lacks the ground truth's meticulous, exhaustive detail, warranting a mid-high score rather than perfect.
