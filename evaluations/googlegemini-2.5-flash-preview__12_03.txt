8.0

**Justification:**

The LLM answer correctly gave "No" and cited the two cases (C002 and C004) that disprove the fact, accurately listing the intervening activities and the event order.

**Main points of deduction:**
- The answer omits comment on the other two cases (C001 and C003), which do *not* violate the rule and should be mentioned to demonstrate comprehensive evidence coverage.
- The answer lacks a summary statement quantifying the proportion of cases that do or do not support the claim, as shown in the ground truth.
- It does not use a table or structured comparison for added clarity and completeness.
- The LLM answer provides correct and relevant evidence, but the absence of mention of positive cases and of more comprehensive, systematic justification as in the ground truth merits a significant deduction for strictness.

**Result:** Correct core evidence and answer, but lacks completeness and systematic justification as per the ground truth.
