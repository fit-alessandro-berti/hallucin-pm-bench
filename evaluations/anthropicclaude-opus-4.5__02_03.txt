**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1**: Near-exact match (minor phrasing difference: "distinct cases" vs. "cases"; same count and list). Full points.
- **Q2**: Correct activity ("Pack_Items"), but violates "concise" instruction with redundant restatement, full timeline explanation (~20 extra words, unasked-for proof). Significant deduction for verbosity (-2 points equivalent).
- **Q3**: Correct ("Cancel_Order"), but adds unneeded parenthetical "(in case C789)". Minor verbosity but still a deviation (-0.5 points equivalent).
- **Overall**: Perfect factual accuracy and bullet-point structure, but fails strict conciseness (extra intro "Here are the answers:", bolder phrasing, longer responses). Strict policy deducts notably for any non-minimal differences vs. ground truth. 10.0 requires near-identical brevity/formatting.
