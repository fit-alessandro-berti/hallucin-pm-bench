The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible and provides the correct initial firing sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) to enable and fire T5 without T3 having fired, which demonstrates the core possibility. This matches the ground truth's prefix for reaching T5's firing. However, under strict evaluation, there are notable differences: the sequence is incomplete, omitting the necessary T6 and T3 steps to fully illustrate T3 firing after T5 via the feedback loop, which the ground truth includes as part of the "shortest firing sequence that achieves this order." The LLM also lacks any explanation, markings, justification of minimality, or details on why the shortcut and loop enable the orderingâ€”elements central to the ground truth's thorough proof. These omissions represent significant gaps in completeness and depth, warranting a deduction despite the accurate core response.
