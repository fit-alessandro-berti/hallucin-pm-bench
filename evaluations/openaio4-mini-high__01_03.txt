The LLM answer is highly accurate and faithful to the process description, with an exact match on part (b) including all documents in correct first-appearance order, no hallucinations (e.g., no mention of absent KYC/AML elements), and complete coverage of the two decision points in part (a). However, under utmost strictness, deduct 0.8 points total for minor phrasing differences in part (a): (1) use of "€250 000 or less" and "applicant's requested amount" (vs. exact "≤ €250 000" and no possessive); (2) addition of "fewer than two approvals means it fails" (implied but not stated in ground truth, altering conciseness); (3) informal "you proceed" (vs. neutral "it proceeds"); and (4) "passes this gate" vs. ground truth's "may advance only when," slightly diverging from one-sentence rule precision despite semantic equivalence.
