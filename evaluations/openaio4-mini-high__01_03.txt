9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, both in content and structure. Here's a breakdown:

**Part a (Decision Points):**
- The LLM answer correctly describes the two decision points:
  1. Skip Manual-Underwriting-Review if risk is Low or Medium and requested amount ≤ €250,000.
  2. TriVote gate: at least two of three must approve.
- The LLM's language is clear, concise, and matches the rules. However, the exact language "Conditional skip of manual underwriting" and "manual underwriting" is slightly less precise than "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check" and "Manual-Underwriting-Review"—but this is a very minor wording issue.

**Part b (Required Documents):**
- List and order are entirely correct, fully matching the ground truth.
- No hallucinated documents.
- The answer separates "Signed Offer Sheet 77" from "Offer Sheet 77," correctly reflecting first appearance order.

**Points deducted (1 point):**
- Minor loss for: "Conditional skip of manual underwriting (after Tri-Color-Risk-Check)" rather than "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check" referencing the named step exactly as in process (minor terminology fidelity issue).
- The phrase "fewer than two approvals means it fails" could be a bit more formal/precise as "the loan may advance only when at least two of the three approvers record 'Approve'."
- The small phrase "you proceed to manual underwriting" is slightly less precise than the named process step.

**No major omissions or hallucinations.**

**Conclusion:**  
9.0 — Very high fidelity, extremely minor deviations in naming/phrasing, but otherwise an accurate, non-hallucinatory, and precise answer.
