The LLM answer correctly identifies all three concurrent task sets from Process B, matching the ground truth in content and structure for the enumerated lines. However, it includes an unrequested introductory sentence, violating the strict instruction to return only "numbered lines" without additional text. Minor spacing differences after commas (single vs. double spaces in ground truth) are present but negligible. Under utmost strictness, the extraneous introduction warrants a significant deduction, preventing a perfect score.
