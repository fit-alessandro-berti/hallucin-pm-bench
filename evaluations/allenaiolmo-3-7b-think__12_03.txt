**9.5**

The LLM answer is factually perfect: correctly answers "No", identifies the exact same counterexamples (C002, C004) with precise sequences and timestamps from the log, acknowledges the compliant cases (C001, C003), and logically disproves the "always" claim. No errors in analysis or citations.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic/presentation differences from ground truth:
- Lacks the exhaustive case-by-case **table** format (bulleted prose instead).
- No explicit "Immediate successor?" column or count ("two out of four").
- Slightly less structured conclusion phrasing.

Under utmost strictness, these format deviations count as small differences, but substance is identical, warranting a near-perfect score.
