9.6

Rationale:

The LLM answer very closely matches the ground truth; all statuses are correct. The justifications, while worded slightly differently, still accurately and succinctly describe the compliance status for each rule and are within the 20-word limit.

Minor Point Deduction:
- For R2, the LLM answer states "Ship_Goods occurred before this approval, not after the last required approval." The ground truth more precisely focuses on the 2-day requirement after the last (i.e., after the new Manager Approval caused by the Change_Request). The LLM implies the correct reason, but the explicit mention of ">2 days" is absent.
- For R5, the justification could emphasize "before new Manager Approval," though it does flag the lack of approval before subsequent steps.
- Slight variations in wording or clarity (use of “final approval” or “last required approval”)—not errors, but slightly less clear.

Otherwise, the result, logic, and formatting are correct. These small justifications for minor point deduction bring the score to 9.6.
