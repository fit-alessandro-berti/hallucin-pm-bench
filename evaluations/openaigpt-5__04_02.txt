10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable), overall conclusion (NON-COMPLIANT), and justification accuracy/content. Justifications are concise (â‰¤20 words), factually correct, and address violations precisely (e.g., R2 timing/sequence, R3 order, R5 pre-approval steps). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., R2 emphasis on "before" vs. dates) do not alter correctness. Format adheres to prompt requirements without errors.
