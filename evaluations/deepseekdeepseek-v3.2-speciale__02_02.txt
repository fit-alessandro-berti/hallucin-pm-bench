The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content, sequence, distinct items, ordering, and structure:
- Q1/A1: Identical ("3").
- Q2/A2: Identical sequence of activities with correct "→" separators (prompt-specified); minor conventional spacing around arrows in ground truth is not required by prompt and not a factual error.
- Q3/A3: Identical distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered (A→C); ground truth's bullet formatting (<br>/-) is presentational, not required ("one per line").

No extras, omissions, fabrications, or hallucinations. Perfect adherence under strict line-by-line evaluation.
