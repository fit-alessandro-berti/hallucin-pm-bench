**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways under utmost strictness:

- **Structure/format**: Traditional vertical RACI (Task | R | A | C | I) vs. ground truth's transposed role-columns (TA | RL | Ops Mgr | IT) with single-letter bolded entries (**R**/**A**) and legend. No matching header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), no legend, no post-table notes.
- **Roles**: Omits "Operations Manager" entirely (present in every ground truth row as primary **A**). Uses full role names in cells vs. letters.
- **Tasks**: 8 rows (malformed split first row; extras like "Ensure SWIFT message transmission" and "Release payment for processing"); wordings differ (e.g., "Receive and log transaction instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Sanctions screening" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; no bold "**KYC Review**"). Misses exact phrasings; malformed Markdown.
- **Assignments**: No matches across any task/role (e.g., KYC Review: LLM Regulatory Liaison R/A vs. GT TA C / RL **R** / Ops **A** / IT I; all others mismatch completely).
- **Coverage**: Fails to replicate exact mandated emphasis, legend, and notes verifying vocabulary adherence.

Even minor wording/empty-cell differences compound to total non-equivalence.
