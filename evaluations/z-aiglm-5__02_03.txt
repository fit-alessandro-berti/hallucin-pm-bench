- Q1 nearly identical (minor wording "distinct"; lacks "A1:" label, but lists cases correctly).
- Q2 correct answer, but adds unrequested full sequence (violates "concise"; significant deduction).
- Q3 correct answer, but adds unrequested explanation (violates "concise"; significant deduction).
- Overall: factually perfect, bullet format followed, but extra content deviates from ground truth's minimalism under strict "concise only" rule.
