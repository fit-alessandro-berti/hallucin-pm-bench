**9.2**

The LLM answer is correct, complete, and directly addresses the prompt with a valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3), full markings for transparency, and a brief justification highlighting the inhibitor arc and p4 emptiness pre-T3. It accurately demonstrates possibility without errors.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total, per strict criteria):**
- Lacks ground truth's deeper insight ("must fire before T3 if ever," permanent disablement via p4/T4 mechanics; ~ -0.4).
- Shorter sequence (stops post-T3, valid but less illustrative than ground truth's extension; ~ -0.2).
- Stylistic differences (verbose markings vs. concise summaries; alternative phrasing without "indeed must"; ~ -0.2).

No factual errors (unlike ground truth's invalid T4 firing, p3=0 prevents it). Highly faithful overall, but strict diff-based grading penalizes incomplete depth match.
