The LLM answer correctly identifies the "No" verdict and provides a valid counterexample from case C003 (lines 6-7), which alone suffices to refute the "always" claim by showing reversed order. However, under strict evaluation, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it omits the equally critical counterexample in case C005 (lines 11-12), where Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order, directly violating the claim in a different way. This gap creates a notable difference from the ground truth's comprehensive two-point justification, and the introductory phrase "while in most cases... follows" introduces unnecessary interpretation not present in the log or ground truth, further reducing precision and fidelity.
