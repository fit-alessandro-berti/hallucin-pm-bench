9.2

The LLM answer is substantively correct and closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying the impossibility due to redacted timestamps and lack of data for computing the required metrics (average cycle time, std dev, 95% CI). It explicitly restates the tasks, specifies the missing columns (start_time/complete_time), and avoids guessing/external knowledge, all in one short paragraph as instructed. However, under utmost strictness:

- Does not explicitly state "all event rows" are redacted (only implies via "actual data... redacted," focusing on timestamps; ground truth precisely notes "all event rows and every timestamp"), a small but key omission since no rows means no "Approve Invoice" events exist.
- Misses direct reference to "Artefact A contains only column headers" and "concrete times for any 'Approve Invoice' execution."
- Does not conclude with the need for "additional raw log entries required," which ground truth includes for completeness.
- Slightly more verbose/role-play flavored intro ("Given the artefacts provided by Orion Aerospace GmbH"); ground truth is more concise and direct ("Impossible — ").

These phrasing/precision differences (no factual errors but not verbatim-matched) warrant a significant deduction from 10.0.
