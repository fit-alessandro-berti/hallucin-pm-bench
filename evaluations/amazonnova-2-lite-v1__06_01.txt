The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the correct alphabetical order both within pairs and overall (C before P for the list start, and correct within each), and outputs one per line. Content is perfect and ignores Process A as instructed.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Spacing around the em dash (—) does not match the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (double spaces before and after —); LLM uses single spaces (" — ").
- No vertical alignment of the — via padding spaces on the second line (e.g., extra spaces after "Procure_Materials" in ground truth).
- Missing code block formatting (```) used in ground truth to preserve exact whitespace.
- Minor trailing whitespace differences on lines.

These are small formatting errors but warrant significant deduction per instructions (≈2.0 points total loss for multiple format deviations from ground truth).
