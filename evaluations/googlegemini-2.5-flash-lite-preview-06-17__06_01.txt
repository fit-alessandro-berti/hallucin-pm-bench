3.0

- The LLM answer gets both correct pairs (**Create_Documentation — Quality_Check**, **Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines**).
- However, it incorrectly lists two additional pairs (**Create_Work_Order — Procure_Materials** and **Create_Work_Order — Schedule_Machines**) that are not valid according to strict process-mining standards; these tasks are in direct sequence and not parallel.
- The format is correct, and all pairs are in alphabetical order.
- Major accuracy penalty: adding extra, invalid pairs.  
- The correct answer is shorter (only 2 lines).  
- Because the LLM produces both correct pairs but two false positives, the grade is heavily penalized for over-inclusion and only partial precision.
