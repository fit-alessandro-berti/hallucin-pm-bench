10.0

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, with correct responses to all three questions (distinct cases, preceding activity for C456, and unique activity). Minor formatting differences (e.g., "Q1" vs. "A1", bolding style, and underscore escaping in activity names) do not impact accuracy or conciseness, as they preserve the required bullet-point structure and content. Under strict evaluation, no substantive errors exist.
