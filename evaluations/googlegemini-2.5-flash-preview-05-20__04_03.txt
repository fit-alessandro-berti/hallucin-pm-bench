**Justification for score:**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and the precise point of violation: that `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), violating Rule 3. It also accurately states that Rule 1 and Rule 2 are satisfied, and that Rule 4, in terms of activity sequence, is satisfied but affected by the rule 3 violation.

**Point deductions for:**
- The analysis of Rule 1 is somewhat confused, starting by indicating a violation and then correcting itself. This imprecise explanation isn't as crisp or confident as the ground truth answer.
- The Rule 4 discussion is a bit ambiguous, suggesting that the order becomes problematic due to earlier rule violations, rather than clearly stating that CC follows NA and VP as required, even if one of those steps was done out of order. The ground truth more precisely asserts that Rule 4 is satisfied.
- A minor structural issue: the LLM answer mixes justification commentary with rule assessments in a verbose, less organized manner compared to the concise table format of the ground truth.

Given the requirement for utmost strictness and penalizing even small errors, these accuracy and clarity issues justify a reduction for significant but not critical errors.
