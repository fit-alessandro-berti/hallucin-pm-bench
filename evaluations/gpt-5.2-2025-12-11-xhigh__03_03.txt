**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth and Prompt)
- **Semantically close but with hallucinated extras (major deductions)**: The LLM answer correctly models the core flow (validation loop, warranty decision, parallel activities, inventory update, close, two ends) using the required gateways and wrc_ prefixes. However, it invents a separate `receiveTask` ("waits until it is received"), which is descriptive phrasing, not an explicit flow element. Ground truth models the loop minimally as request → validate (implicit wait). This adds an extra task and 2 flows (Flow_4, Flow_5), violating "model **only** the flow elements explicitly mentioned" and "do **not** invent". Significant deduction (-3.0).
- **Added "checks warranty eligibility" task**: Explicitly required by prompt (step 3), modeled correctly before warranty gateway. Ground truth omits it entirely (direct complete_gw → warranty_gw), making LLM *more* accurate to prompt, but creates structural difference vs. ground truth. Minor credit, but counts as difference (-0.5).
- **Unnecessary additions/bloat**: Full `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` section (~150+ lines of shapes/edges/waypoints) not in minimal ground truth (34 lines, no DI). Extra conditionExpressions, flow names (e.g., "incomplete"), gateway names/directions on parallel gateways. Violates minimalism implied by prompt/ground truth. (-1.0).
- **Task names verbatim match prompt better than ground truth**: Exact casing/phrasing (e.g., "validates the claim" lowercase v, "Create shipment order" capital C, "send rejection notice" lowercase s). Ground truth capitalizes first letters inconsistently. No deduction, slight credit.
- **Other minor differences**: Different IDs (verbose vs. ground truth's short), process name, start event name ("online warranty claim" vs. ground truth's altered "Online warranty claim submitted"). Sequence flows 17 vs. 15. Small but cumulative under strictness (-0.5).
- **Strengths (no omissions, valid BPMN)**: All required gateways, exactly 2 ends, all explicit tasks present, correct loop/parallel logic, self-contained XML. Base ~8.0 before deductions.

Total differences (structure, extras, bloat) exceed semantic equivalence threshold for full credit per rubric. Harsh penalties for extras/hallucinations yield 4.0.
