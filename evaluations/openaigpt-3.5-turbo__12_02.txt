The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a valid, concise justification citing a key counter-example (C003, line 6, implying line 7), which is sufficient to disprove the "always" claim. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits the second counter-example in C005 (line 11, no prior Receive_Order), which the ground truth explicitly highlights as a clear violation, making the justification less comprehensive. Minor deductions also for not bolding "No" as in ground truth and not explicitly citing line 7, though these are secondary to the missed case.
