The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, directly contradicting the ground truth by asserting "No" instead of "Yes," and providing a flawed proof that reverses the inhibitor arc's implication (claiming p4=0 requires T3 to have fired, when T3 actually populates p4, enabling T5 only before T3). It fails to identify the valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3) and misses the key enabling condition and ordering necessity, resulting in zero alignment with the ground truth.
