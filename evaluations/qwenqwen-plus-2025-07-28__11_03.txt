7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, with identical quantifications of excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). This aligns perfectly with the ground truth and prompt data. Structure as an executive memo is appropriate, including headers, body, and bullet-point recommendations only for actions, adhering to the "only the memo text" instruction and ~150-word limit (LLM is ~120 words).

However, significant deductions for differences:
- **Recommendations (major loss: -2.0 points)**: Entirely different actions from ground truth (e.g., LLM suggests underwriters/shift overlap/automation; ground truth uses pre-checks/analyst addition/heuristic). While both are concrete and loosely tied to data (e.g., addressing waits/throughput), the lack of match indicates deviation; prompt requires data-driven but doesn't specify exact actions, yet strict comparison penalizes full divergence on this core element.
- **Narrative and inventions (-0.3 points)**: LLM adds ungrounded phrases like "severely underperforming," "affect downstream flow and customer experience," and "non-bottlenecked activities" (not in data), mirroring ground truth's inventions (e.g., "4 805 completed cases," 35% reduction projection) but still violating "ground every sentence in the data; do NOT invent." Minor but strict penalty.
- **Formatting and details (-0.2 points)**: Different subject (e.g., "Urgent Process Improvements" vs. "Throughput Bottlenecks"), sender ("Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office"), ordering of activities, and no bolding/header for recommendations as in ground truth. Small but impacts polish.

Overall, strong on identification/quantification (80% match) but weaker on recommendations and fidelity, justifying 7.5 under strict criteria.
