10.0

The LLM answer accurately and correctly refuses to compute the value, mirroring the ground truth in essence and detail by citing the absence of timestamps/durations (explicitly noting the redaction, which aligns with the log's description) and explaining why calculation is impossible. It addresses both prompt parts implicitly: declining the average (Q1) and providing reasoning as the explanation (Q2, noting no calculation is feasible). No fabrication, no errors in interpretation, and precise adherence to the system's rule against unsupported answers. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., listing cases, which is factual but not in ground truth) do not detract, as they enhance clarity without contradiction.
