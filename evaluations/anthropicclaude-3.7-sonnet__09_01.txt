The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be determined from the provided data because there is no timestamp or duration informationâ€”all such fields have been redacted. The explanation is clear and matches almost verbatim the reasoning in the ground truth, emphasizing the absence of necessary temporal data and refraining from fabricating any result. No errors or omissions are present compared to the ground truth, so the response is entirely correct.
