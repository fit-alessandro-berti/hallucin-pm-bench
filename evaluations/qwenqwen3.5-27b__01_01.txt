**7.0**

### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer is strong on identifying the correct number of decision points (3) and perfectly matches the ground truth on the complete list of 7 required documents (same items, similar conditional note on *AuditTrail*). However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for:

- **Structural differences** (major deduction: ~1.5 pts): No table format for decision points; uses verbose headers, bullets, and "Logic/Outcome" sub-bullets instead of GT's concise table with explicit "#", "Decision point", and "Branching logic/outcomes" columns.
- **Content inaccuracies/omissions in decision points** (major deductions: ~1.0 pts total):
  - #1 (*Triage*): Misses explicit negative branch ("*Not eligible* → claim rejected/returned"); vaguely says "determines if proceeds" without rejection outcome.
  - #2 (*Finance*): Incomplete outcome; states payment after "succeeded" but omits AND condition with *Senior* review (per constraints); no explicit "*Rejected* → process ends."
  - #3 (*High-value*): Mostly matches but lacks "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**" timing; treats as standalone without linking to final approval.
  - Wrong categorization/order vs. GT: LLM sequences Triage → Finance → Amount; GT has Triage → Amount (post-Finance) → Final approval (Finance/Senior combo). Misses "final payment approval" grouping.
  - Inconsistent branching: Only #3 shows true/false; others imply positive paths only, vs. GT's full branches everywhere.
- **Minor extras/phrasing** (small deductions: ~0.5 pts): Unnecessary intro sentence; per-step parentheticals in docs list (GT plain); no closing note disclaiming other docs/activities.

Overall ~70% match in precision/structure despite core accuracy—good effort but not faithful replication.
