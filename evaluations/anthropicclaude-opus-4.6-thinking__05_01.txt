The LLM answer suggests a fundamentally different improvement: boundary timer on **Task_RequestDocs** (late in missing-docs branch only) with arbitrary PT44H (assumptive buffer), vs. ground truth's timer on **Task_Receive** (early, all paths) with exact PT48H. Major mismatches in placement, duration, coverage, timer ID ("Timer_48h"), and XML snippet (<bpmn:timeDuration>). Minor: extra header, flow IDs (f4/f6), wordier explanation. Conceptually similar but incorrect implementation details; does not match ground truth.
