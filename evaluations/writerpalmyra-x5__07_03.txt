7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Correct content (majority)**: Added tasks (3/3 correct: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer). Removed tasks (1/1 correct: Task_ManualReview). One gateway change correct (Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel).
- **Critical omission (-2.0)**: Missed Gateway_Payment change (v1: exclusiveGateway → v2: parallelGateway), violating "summarise *all* functional changes" and "only verifiable differences" under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES. This is a significant functional difference, warranting major deduction.
- **Formatting differences (-0.5)**: Lacks "-" bullets used in ground truth for all list items; uses plain lines instead. Ground truth aligns second gateway with spaces. Prompt does not mandate bullets, but strict comparison to ground truth penalizes divergence.
- **Other**: Headings verbatim and in order ✓. No extras/commentary ✓. No guesses ✓. Overall structure close but incomplete.

Score reflects ~80% match (5/6 total changes listed, minor format issues), derated for strictness on omission and format.
