### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit):** The LLM correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no synonyms or leaks of disallowed terms. The core structure is a Markdown table covering the roles, and it attempts to address the process activities without merging them improperly.
- **Major Errors (significant deductions):**
  - **Activity names and coverage:** Renames "Compliance Officer Approval" to "Compliance Approval (Score > 70)", violating "do not rename" instruction. Adds an unauthorized extra activity ("Notify Originating Analyst"), directly breaking "do not add activities". Ground truth has exactly six activities, including a precise "Compliance Officer Approval" without parentheticals; LLM has seven with inaccuracies. This alone warrants heavy penalty for strict adherence.
  - **RACI assignments:** Widespread inaccuracies across nearly all cells. For example:
    - "Intake Vetting": Misses "C" for Compliance Analyst and "I" for Treasury Ops; uses empty cells instead of "–".
    - "KYC Review" and "AML Screening": Fails to assign "A" to Compliance Analyst, "C" to Compliance Officer, and "I" to Treasury Ops.
    - "Risk Scoring": Misses "C" for Front-Office Analyst and "I" for Treasury Ops.
    - "Compliance Approval": Misses "I" for Front-Office Analyst; incorrectly adds "I" for Treasury Ops.
    - "Release Funds": Misses "I" for Front-Office Analyst, "C" for Compliance Analyst, and "C" for Compliance Officer.
    - Extra "Notify" row is entirely invented and mismatches implied ground truth integration.
    These omissions/additions create substantive differences, not minor tweaks—each mismatch is a strict violation.
  - **Format and presentation:** Adds unauthorized header ("### RACI Matrix: Wire-Transfer Process") and legend, which ground truth omits. Uses plain "A, R" without bolding (ground truth bolds **R, A** for emphasis). Employs empty cells instead of "–" for no involvement. No exact match to ground truth's clean table structure.
- **Overall:** While vocabulary policy is followed, the matrix fails to faithfully cover "every activity" without additions/renames, and RACI logic diverges significantly (covering ~50% accurately at best). Under utmost strictness, this reflects incomplete fidelity, justifying a low-mid score despite partial correctness.
