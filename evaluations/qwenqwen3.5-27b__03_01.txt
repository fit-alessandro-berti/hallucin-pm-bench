**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer correctly models the process flow, loop, tasks, and exactly 3 exclusive gateways (despite prompt mentioning "two decision points"—description implies 3, matching ground truth). No inventions/hallucinations (e.g., no timers, extra tasks, parallels). Concise IDs, <40 lines, single <definitions> block—all per prompt. Semantically accurate to description.

However, **utmost strictness vs. ground truth yields deductions for differences** (each small diff = significant loss, ~0.5-1.0/pt):

- **No <?xml declaration>** (-0.5): Ground has it.
- **Definitions/process attrs differ** (id="D1"/"P1", targetNamespace="http://acmetech.com", no name/isExecutable) (-1.0): Ground more specific ("http://acmetech/support", id="support_ticket" name/isExecutable).
- **Start/end IDs/names missing/altered** ("s1"/"e1" unnamed vs. "start"/"end" named "Ticket Submitted"/"Ticket Closed") (-1.0).
- **t1 name** ("Classify" vs. "Auto-Classification") (-0.5): Minor wording diff, but not exact.
- **Gateways unnamed** (vs. descriptive "Password Reset?"/etc.) (-0.5).
- **Conditions modeled differently** (flow name="..." vs. embedded `<conditionExpression xsi:type="tFormalExpression">yes/no</conditionExpression>`) (-1.0): Functionally implies decisions but not XML-precise match; lacks formal logic.
- **Minor flow diffs** (names like "Password Reset"/"Persists" good/per description, but no expressions) (-0.5).

Core structure/sequence perfect (10 base), -5.0 total deductions = **7.0**. Higher if stylistic diffs ignored; lower if byte-match required.
