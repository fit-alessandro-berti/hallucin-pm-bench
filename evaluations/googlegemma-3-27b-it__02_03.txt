- The LLM answer matches the ground truth on all three substantive points:
    - For A1: "3" (matches "3 cases", missing explicit list C123, C456, C789),
    - For A2: "Pack_Items" (correct),
    - For A3: "Cancel_Order" (correct).
- Point loss: The answer to Q1 lacks the explicit listing of the case names as required by the ground truth ("C123, C456, C789"). This is a (minor but strict) deviation from the requested format and completeness.
- Otherwise, the logical content and order are correct and concise, as instructed.
