10.0  
- The LLM answer fully and concisely addresses all three questions with exact matches to the core content of the ground truth (distinct cases: 3; preceding activity for C456: Pack_Items; unique activity: Cancel_Order).  
- Minor formatting differences (e.g., absent labels like "A1" and case listing in Q1, unescaped underscore in Q2) do not alter factual accuracy and align with the prompt's "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction, imposing no deduction under strict evaluation.
