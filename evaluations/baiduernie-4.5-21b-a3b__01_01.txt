6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM answer identifies three decision points, but only two are articulated precisely:
  1. *Eligibility check* — correct, via FlightManifest/WeatherReport.
  2. *Refund Amount Validation* — correct, refers to >€1,000.  
- The third, "High-Value Claim Audit," is not an actual branching decision; it repeats the threshold and focuses on the audit step, not a distinct decision point.
- The LLM misses the *final* approval/rejection decision after pre-approval/auditor review, where payment is only executed if explicitly approved. This is a missing decision point.
- Branching logic/outcomes (“continue”, “claim rejected”, etc.) are not described.
- Placement of “Amount Threshold” is not clear in the process stage (after pre-approval, as per process), and the third decision is somewhat redundant/confusingly described.

**Required Documents:**
- The LLM lists all the required documents, but with a small error:
    - It states "*AuditTrail* (for review by Senior Auditor)" under "Required Documents," but only within the context of the third decision point—it’s not clearly listed as a standalone artefact in the main document list. (However, it does list "AuditTrail" in the "Required Documents" section—so partial credit.)
- The ground truth clarifies *AuditTrail* is only relevant for high-value but should be part of the catalogue.
- The LLM does not state that some artifacts are conditional/"only for claims > €1 000" for AuditTrail, unlike the ground truth.

**No extra or legacy artefacts** — the LLM does not add any, which is correct.

**Summary of Issues:**
- Some important distinctions in the branching and approval steps are lost or imprecisely described.
- Misses a key decision point and does not spell out outcomes for each decision.
- Minor inaccuracy/lack of clarity in listing conditions for some artefacts.
- The answer structure is generally correct and doesn’t introduce errors beyond those listed.

**Strict grading justification:**  
Major points lost for missing/formulating a key decision and being vague about decision sequence/outcomes. Small points lost for lack of conditionality precision and structure.

**Final score: 6.0**
