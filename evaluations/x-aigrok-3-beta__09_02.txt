The LLM answer correctly identifies that the calculation cannot be performed due to lack of timestamps or duration data, aligning closely with the ground truth. However, it misses a minor but important point: the ground truth specifies that "only event counts" were provided and clearly mentions the absence of "the required start-to-completion intervals". The LLM answer could be improved by explicitly referencing that only event counts are given and by being slightly more explicit on the impossibility due to lack of interval data. This small omission warrants a minor point deduction.
