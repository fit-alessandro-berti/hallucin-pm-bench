The LLM answer is highly accurate and directly addresses the prompt with a concise explanation, matching the ground truth in core reasoning (lack of timestamps/durations and reliance on counts alone). Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., not explicitly referencing "start-to-completion intervals" or using the exact structure with em-dashes), per strict evaluation criteria.
