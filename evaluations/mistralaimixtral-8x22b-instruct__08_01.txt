### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Core correctness (perfect match, no points lost)**: Both correctly answer **Yes**, identify the exact minimal firing sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** as proof of possibility, and confirm enabling condition (p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0 after T2, with T3 not yet fired). No factual errors in LLM answer; markings and logic precise.
- **Justification (minor deduction -0.4)**: LLM provides brief, accurate justification matching question requirement ("justify briefly"), focusing on enabling post-T1/T2. Ground truth adds deeper insight ("must fire before T3 if ever," permanent disablement post-T3, inhibitor mechanics), which LLM omits—difference in depth/completeness, penalized under strictness for deviation.
- **Sequence details (minor deduction -0.2)**: LLM's sequence is minimal/correct (stops post-T5, sufficient). Ground truth extends to invalid T4 firing (p3=0 post-T5, T4 requires p3 ≥ 1)—LLM avoids this error, but differs in length/scope (no post-T5 steps), counted as difference.
- **Structure & extras (minor deduction -0.2)**: LLM has verbose intro analysis (helpful but extraneous deviation); different formatting (e.g., "p1:1" vs "`p1 = 1`", numbered lists vs bold). Ground truth more concise/direct.
- **Overall**: Extremely close (90%+ overlap on essentials), but strict diff-based grading deducts for omitted insight, sequence variance, and stylistic gaps. No "small errors" in LLM (e.g., no invalid claims), but differences prevent perfect 10.0.
