7.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1-Q4 but errs in Q5 by incorrectly including "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77, per the log). This factual inaccuracy in the list makes the JSON schema non-compliant with the expected output, warranting a significant deduction despite the otherwise strong performance and correct sequencing analysis. The pre-JSON explanatory text also deviates from the strict "exactly this JSON schema" instruction, further reducing the score.
