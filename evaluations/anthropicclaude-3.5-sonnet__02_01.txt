7.5

The LLM answer is nearly correct but contains one significant error:

- Q1: 3 — correct.
- Q2: "Pack_Items" — correct.
- Q3: "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00" — correct.
- Q4: 2 — correct.
- Q5: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order", "Quality_Check"] — Incorrect. "Quality_Check" occurs as the first event for case C-77, so it should not be listed here.

Including "Quality_Check" in Q5 is a clear factual error stemming from a misreading of the log. Given the prompt requests strictness and even small errors should incur significant penalty, 2.5 points are deducted, resulting in:

Final score: 7.5
