The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it wrongly concludes "No" for Q1, directly contradicting the ground truth's "Yes," and provides a flawed explanation for Q2 that ignores the valid sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) where T5 fires before T3 by using the alternative path to mark P5 while preserving the P2 token. This misinterpretation of "before" (allowing T3 to remain unfired afterward) represents a complete failure to analyze the net's concurrency, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
