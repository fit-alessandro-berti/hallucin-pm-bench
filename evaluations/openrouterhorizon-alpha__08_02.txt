2.0

The LLM answer is incorrect for Question 1—it asserts "No" when the correct answer is "Yes". This is a fundamental and critical error. In Question 2, the explanation given is logical but based entirely on the wrong assumption, leading to a fully incorrect answer. The model misinterprets the Petri net's structure: specifically, it falsely assumes T3 must fire prior to T5 and does not recognize the alternative path to produce P5 (via T1→T2→T7→T4) while P2 remains available for T5. No firing sequence is provided, and the LLM does not demonstrate the counterexample requested. These are major flaws.

Deduction for errors:

- Incorrect main answer to Q1 (critical): -7 points.
- Q2 explanation logical but fully based on the wrong premise, no sequence given: -1 point.
- Minor credit for at least trying to analyze the marking logic: +0.5 point.

Final: 2.0 (Fail—answer directly contradicts ground truth in both content and reasoning, with only a minimal effort at analysis.)
