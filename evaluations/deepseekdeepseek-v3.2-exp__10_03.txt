### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and accuracy, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Added and renamed activities (major violation of "do not rename, merge, or add activities")**: The LLM introduces unauthorized rows like "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst," and renames the approval step as "Approval (for score > 70)" instead of "Compliance Officer Approval." The ground truth strictly limits to six activities without extras, merging implied steps (e.g., no separate "Schedule Payment"). This alone merits heavy deduction (~4 points loss).

- **Incomplete and inaccurate RACI assignments**: Vast differences in responsibilities. For example:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM assigns only "R" to Front-Office Analyst (blanks elsewhere); ground truth has "R, A" for Front-Office, "C" for Compliance Analyst, "I" for Treasury Ops (– for Officer). Misses consulted/informed roles entirely.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: LLM assigns only "R" to Compliance Analyst (blanks); ground truth adds "R, A" for Analyst, "C" for Officer, "I" for Treasury. Systemic omission of "C" and "I."
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM only "R" for Analyst; ground truth has "C" (Front-Office), "R" (Analyst), "A" (Officer), "I" (Treasury). Critical misses on accountability and consultations.
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: LLM's version only "A" for Officer; ground truth has "R, A" for Officer, "I" for Front-Office, "C" for Analyst (– for Treasury).
  - **Release Funds**: LLM assigns "R" (and separately for "Schedule Payment"); ground truth has "R, A" for Treasury, with "I"/"C" for others. Duplication and incompleteness.
  These errors affect ~80% of cells, ignoring process nuances (e.g., escalations imply consultations/informing). Each mismatch is a significant loss (~2-3 points total deduction).

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: 
  - Uses blanks instead of "–" for no involvement (ground truth standard).
  - No bolding on activity names or key RACI cells (e.g., **R, A**), reducing clarity.
  - Header phrasing ("Role / Activity") inverts the ground truth's clean "Activity" column first, though table structure is mostly Markdown-compliant. Minor but deducts under strictness (~0.5 points).

- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit)**: Correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," "Risk Scoring") exactly, with no synonyms leaking. This is the strongest aspect, preventing a total zero (~+2.5 points baseline).

Overall, while the output is a valid Markdown table covering roles and avoiding policy violations on core terms, the proliferation of additions, omissions, and inaccuracies makes it unreliable as a faithful RACI matrix. A perfect match would require exact row count, names, and assignments; this is ~60-70% divergent.
