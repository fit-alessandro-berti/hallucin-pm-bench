**9.5**

The LLM answer is factually perfect: correctly identifies "No" with accurate sequences for all 4 relevant CaseIDs (C001–C004), properly highlights intervening activities in C002 (Pack_Items) and C004 (Check_Fraud), and logically concludes the "always" claim fails due to counterexamples. It strictly adheres to the log evidence and task requirements (Yes/No + justification citing CaseIDs/sequences).

**Minor deductions (-0.5 total, per strictness directive):**
- **Format/style differences** (-0.3): Uses bullet lists with full sequences and bolded notes instead of ground truth's table with "Sequence around Receive_Order", ✅/❌ icons, and focused successor view. Extra post-Validate_Payment activities (e.g., → Pack_Items in C001/C004, → Ship_Order in C003) are correct but not as precisely scoped.
- **Phrasing** (-0.2): Conclusion emphasizes "C002 and C004 violate" (matching ground truth) but lacks exact "two out of the four cases" quantification and table structure; says "not accurate for this excerpt" vs. ground truth's "claim ... is inaccurate".

No factual/log errors; substance is identical.
