3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 4.0/10):**  
The LLM correctly identifies the two core decision points from the prompt (the risk-based conditional skip in Step 4 and the TriVote gate in Step 6) and describes their rules accurately in one sentence each, matching the ground truth's content and phrasing closely (e.g., "Low or Medium and ≤ €250,000" for the skip; "any two" approvals for TriVote, akin to "at least two... record 'Approve'"). However, it deducts points for: (1) incorrectly adding a third "decision point" for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself (Step 3), which is merely an input-generating step, not a gate or branch— the ground truth explicitly frames the first decision as the "risk-based skip *after*" it; (2) numbering it as three items instead of two, diverging from the ground truth's structure. This constitutes a clear misunderstanding and inflation of decision points, warranting significant deduction under strict criteria.

**Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 3.0/10):**  
The LLM lists documents in first-appearance order and avoids hallucinations (no KYC/AML mentions, correctly per note), but major omissions and errors lead to low scoring: (1) Completely misses the three scorecards (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow) from Step 3, which are explicitly required inputs/documents in the process description— this alone is a critical gap, as they appear before the Deck Memo; (2) Fails to distinguish "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate item from "Offer Sheet 77" (per Step 8), treating the signed version as part of Step 7's document; (3) Combines "Signed Offer Sheet 77 + ID Matrix Declaration" into one list item (position 4), while the ground truth separates them as distinct (7 and 8), violating "all documents... in the order they first appear" by undercounting and grouping incorrectly. The result is only 5 items vs. ground truth's 9, with ~50%+ content missing or misrepresented— a substantial deviation requiring heavy point loss for strictness.

**Overall Score Calculation:** Weighted average (equal parts a/b), adjusted downward for cumulative strictness on "small errors" (e.g., extra decision point, grouping) compounding into major inaccuracies. No credit for formatting similarities, as content fidelity is paramount.
