The LLM answer incorrectly places the timer on Task_Triage, which only monitors time *after* reaching triage and fails to enforce the SLA from submission (Start_Claim). It vaguely suggests an "intermediate event" (not boundary/interrupting) and undefined "escalation" without BPMN flows, missing the bypass mechanism. Ground truth correctly uses an interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive to force progression to Task_Triage within 48 hours, directly addressing delays (e.g., doc requests). These are critical errors in BPMN logic and SLA compliance, warranting major point loss despite no new tasks added.
