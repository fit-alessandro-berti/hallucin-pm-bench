The LLM answer is fully accurate and aligns perfectly with the ground truth. Questions 1 and 2 are exact matches in content and calculation. For question 3, the explanation (58 words) explicitly addresses the single occurrence (e.g., 1 in 48 events), instability/variance (skewed by outliers, overfitting to noise), and over-generalization risks (inaccurate conclusions), without exceeding limits or inventing data. No errors or deviations.
