10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct and closely matches the ground truth:

1. **Manual_Fraud_Check occurrence:** States 1 time (case C05)—matches ground truth.
2. **Percentages:**
   - Events: 1/48 = 2.08%—correct.
   - Unique cases: 1/12 = 8.33%—correct.
   - Numbers are calculated explicitly and correctly rounded.
3. **Short explanation:** Clearly refers to the single occurrence (“1 in 48 events”), discusses lack of statistical significance, risk of skew/outlier influence, and dangers of generalizing from such scant data—fulfills all ground truth criteria.

The LLM used only the given log, made no unsupported claims, and complied with rounding and brevity requirements. No errors or omissions are present.
