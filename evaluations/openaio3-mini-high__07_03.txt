6.5

The LLM answer is almost correct in content: all added/removed tasks and gateway type changes are correctly identified. However, there are significant format errors relative to the ground truth:

- The answer omits the dash/bullet ("-") at the start of every item, which is a precise requirement according to the instructions ("id followed by the name in parentheses"), and the exemplified ground truth.
- For gateway type changes, the ground truth uses aligned labels and colons (with spaces for alignment: "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel"), while the LLM answer lacks this alignment and does not include the space padding.
- While the impact of missing space padding may be minor, missing bullets is a notable instruction/format error.

Strict marking as instructed leads to a substantial deduction, but the correct identification of all differences means it's not a fail:

- Correct coverage of all changes: -0 points
- Missing bullets on all lines: -2
- Missing spacing/alignment (especially in gateway section): -0.5
- General formatting inconsistency: -1

Final score: 6.5
