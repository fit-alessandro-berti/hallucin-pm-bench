The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h p95; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quoting figures verbatim from the table. It includes a memo header, stays under 150 words (~120), and omits all prohibited content (no service times, throughput, or other activities). Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting issues, and explicitly promise ≥20% reductions without fabricating table data.

Minor deductions for: (1) action phrasing differences from ground truth (e.g., LLM's automation/escalation vs. GT's reminders/pilot; triage vs. pre-classification—similar intent but not identical, reflecting ~5% divergence); (2) speculative phrasing without GT's invented "data" citations (e.g., no "pilot tests" or "estimated 30%"); (3) slight formatting inconsistencies (e.g., "Avg" vs. "avg", "95th" vs. "p95", added header not in GT). These are small but warrant strict point loss per instructions.
