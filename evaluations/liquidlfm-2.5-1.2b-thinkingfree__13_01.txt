7.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1**: Exact match (1). Full points.
- **Q2**: Numerically exact (5.56%), formatting minor variance (% vs. " %"). Full points. However, explanation typo "Frachility" (should be "Frequency" or "Fraction") deducts slightly overall.
- **Q3**: Correct identifier (A1002), but lacks ground truth phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”"); concise list acceptable per prompt ("List..."), but strict diff in completeness: -1.5 pts.
- **Q4**: First reason ("Too small sample size") matches exactly. Second ("non-representative sampling method") is vague/generic, does not clearly match any specific ground truth reason (e.g., no tie to "temporal bias," "case-mix bias," or log-derived details like "18 events/four cases/short window"); lacks elaboration (e.g., variance example, time window). Explanation adds "non-random selection" (still generic, no log tie-in): -2.5 pts.
- **Overall**: Correct core facts (no hallucinations), but phrasing diffs, vague Q4, unasked explanation with typo, minor formatting = significant deductions per strictness rule. No extras like GT calculation display. 70% alignment.
