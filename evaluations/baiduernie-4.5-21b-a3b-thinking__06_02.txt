The LLM answer correctly identifies and enumerates all three parallel blocks from Process B in the exact format of numbered lines with comma-separated tasks, matching the ground truth verbatim. No tasks from Processes A or C are mentioned, and sequential tasks are properly excluded from the lists. However, the inclusion of an extraneous **Explanation** section—while accurate—violates the prompt's strict instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" by adding unrequested details, including references to excluded sequential tasks (e.g., `Dry_Fit_Assembly`). This small formatting deviation warrants a deduction under utmost strictness.
