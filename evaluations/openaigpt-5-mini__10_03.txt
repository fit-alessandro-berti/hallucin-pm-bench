6.0

**Assessment:**

**Vocabulary:**
- All required vocabulary (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) is used exactly and nowhere are forbidden synonyms present. **(Full marks here.)**

**Activities:**
- The LLM answer introduces an unnecessary “Schedule Payment” activity not present in the ground truth, which is a deviation.
- The LLM answer merges “Release Funds & Notify Originating Analyst” into one activity, while the ground truth only lists “Release Funds”. The combination isn’t strictly incorrect, as the process narrative describes the notification, but the rubric says not to add/merge activities, so this is a notable error.

**Roles in RACI assignments:**
- **Intake Vetting**: LLM marks Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer as “C”, “I”, respectively, but ground truth only gives “C” to Compliance Analyst and “–” to Compliance Officer (LLM error).
- **KYC Review** & **AML Screening**: LLM marks Compliance Officer as “C” in both cases, and Treasury Ops as “I”; this matches ground truth.
- **Risk Scoring**:
    - LLM: Compliance Analyst (R, A); Compliance Officer (C); Front-Office Analyst (I); Treasury Ops (I)
    - Ground truth: Compliance Analyst (R); Compliance Officer (A); Front-Office Analyst (C); Treasury Ops (I)
    - LLM fails to show shared responsiblity (should be Analyst R, Officer A); gives wrong involvement for FO Analyst (should be C, not I).
- **Compliance Officer Approval**:
    - LLM matches ground truth except that Treasury Ops is marked “I” but should not be involved.
- **Release Funds (& Notify Originating Analyst)**: LLM assigns “C” to Compliance Officer (correct), “I” to FOA (correct), but also “I” to CA (should be “C”), merges notification into one activity, and Treasury Ops is “R, A” (matches ground truth). The merging itself is a deduction per instructions.
- **Extra Activity**: LLM adds “Schedule Payment”, which is not present in ground truth, as a distinct step.

**Formatting:**
- Markdown table is fine.
- No activities renamed, but there is both a merge (release & notify) and an addition.

**Summary of deductions:**
- Extra activity added (Schedule Payment): –1.5
- Activity merging (Release Funds & Notify combined with notification): –1.0
- Incorrect RACI assignments for several activities (esp. Risk Scoring, Intake Vetting): –1.5
- Minor but clear role marking errors on other activities: –1.0
- Exactly required vocabulary: 0 deduction

Strictly enforcing the instructions, **6.0** reflects that the vocabulary mandates are obeyed, but activity structure and role mapping are meaningfully inaccurate per the ground truth.
