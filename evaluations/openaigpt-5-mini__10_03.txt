The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms without synonyms or leaks, and structures a Markdown table with all roles. However, it incurs severe penalties for multiple strict violations: (1) Adds an unauthorized extra activity ("Schedule Payment"), merging/escalating beyond the narrative without combining appropriately (ground truth has 6 activities; LLM has 7). (2) Renames the final activity as "Release Funds & Notify Originating Analyst" instead of aligning with "Release Funds," altering the narrative's intent. (3) Fails to use dashes (–) for no involvement, instead incorrectly assigning roles (e.g., "I" or "C" where ground truth has –, such as Front-Office Analyst for KYC Review/AML Screening, Compliance Officer for Intake Vetting, Treasury Ops for Compliance Officer Approval). (4) Numerous RACI assignment errors even for shared activities: e.g., Risk Scoring (Front-Office Analyst: C vs. I; Compliance Analyst: R vs. R,A; Compliance Officer: A vs. C); Release Funds (Compliance Analyst: C vs. I). (5) Lacks bolding for activities and R/A as in ground truth, though minor. These accumulate to indicate poor fidelity, with at least 8+ specific differences plus structural additions.
