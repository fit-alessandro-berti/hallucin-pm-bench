8.5

The LLM answer is essentially correct in content: it lists the only two pairs of tasks in Process B that are eligible for parallel execution according to the description. The pairs themselves are correctly identified, and the order within each pair is alphabetical.

However, it loses significant points for formatting:

- The ground truth answer uses padded alignment in the second pair ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines") to keep the dash vertically aligned, showing attention to detail in formatting. The LLM answer does not use this padding/alignment, which is a noticeable formatting deviation.
- The pairs themselves are in the correct overall alphabetical order and are formatted with a single space around the dash. However, the exact requirement, as seen in the ground truth, is three spaces before and after the dash.
- The LLM used "—" (an em dash) instead of "  —  " (with spaces), but the distinction is subtle; however, strictness is required per instruction.
- There is a missing code block around the output, as in the ground truth answer. This is another minor but visible formatting inconsistency.

Given that the actual pairs listed are correct, but that the formatting has multiple deviations—mattering per the instructions of utmost strictness and substantial penalties for even small infractions—8.5 is an appropriate score.
