### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring breakdown):
- **Format adherence (major deductions)**: Headings use colons (":") instead of plain verbatim text. No dashes or bullets for lists. No parentheses for task names. Gateway format lacks IDs and uses incorrect phrasing ("exclusiveGateway → parallelGateway" vs. specific "id: exclusive → parallel"). Ground truth is precise list format. (-3.0)
- **ADDED TASKS (major incompleteness)**: Lists only 1/3 tasks (Task_NotifyCustomer, but missing name in parentheses). Omits Task_FraudCheck and Task_FastTrackApproval. (-3.0)
- **REMOVED TASKS (complete error)**: Incorrectly states "None"; Task_ManualReview is verifiably absent in v2. (-2.5)
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES (partial but insufficient)**: Detects change type but omits both specific IDs (Gateway_ReviewNeeded, Gateway_Payment). Not verifiable per prompt. (-2.0)
- **Overall**: Only ~20-25% accuracy in content; extraneous "None" adds invalid info. No commentary is good, but misses overwhelm matches. Total reflects strict policy.
