8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the core content of the ground truth without extraneous information about other processes or unrelated details. However, it loses points for minor but noticeable differences under strict evaluation: an unnecessary introductory sentence, inconsistent formatting (bold **Set #** labels and bullet points instead of numbered 1./2. with backticks and â€– symbols), slightly wordier descriptions of the parallel sections ("between Parallel Split #1 and Merge #1" vs. concise "first parallel block"), and omission of the ground truth's explicit concluding statement about no other parallel tasks. These small presentation and phrasing variances deduct 1.5 points from a perfect score.
