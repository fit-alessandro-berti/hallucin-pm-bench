The LLM answer is nearly perfect: it correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, numbers them in order, and specifies the tasks in each set. The answer follows the instruction to focus solely on Process B and does not mention Processes A or C.

However, compared to the ground truth, there are very minor formatting differences:
- The LLM uses "Set 1" and "Set 2" and describes the parallel relationship in plain text, while the ground truth explicitly numbers with "1." and "2." and uses a symbolic parallel notation (`â€–`).
- The LLM does not state "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," which, while not explicitly required, does reinforce completeness in the ground truth.

These are extremely minor discrepancies, so only 0.5 is deducted for utmost strictness.
