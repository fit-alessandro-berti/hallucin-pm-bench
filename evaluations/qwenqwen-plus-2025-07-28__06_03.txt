The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets in the required order, with exact task names matching the ground truth. It adheres to the prompt by focusing solely on Process B and avoiding extraneous information. However, the format differs slightly: it uses simple curly braces and commas instead of the ground truth's descriptive bolded labels, backticks, and parallel symbol (â€–), and omits the explanatory final sentence. Under strict evaluation, these presentation inconsistencies warrant a minor deduction despite semantic equivalence.
