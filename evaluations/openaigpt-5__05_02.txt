8.0

The LLM answer is correct in identifying the optimal SLA-compliance improvement (reducing the due date of "Collect Equipment" from 5 days to 2 days). The unified diff is syntactically correct, concise, and compliant with the "single hunk" instruction (since the visible change matches the ground truth and touches only one attribute of an existing element). However, points are lost for the rationale:

- The LLM rationale is not written as a stand-alone sentence distinct from the diff as per ground truth.
- The rationale does not mention the concrete impact regarding "contractual 3-day SLA", which is specified in the ground truth rationale. 
- Instead, it generally refers to “overall cycle time” and “adherence to the onboarding SLA”, lacking the quantifiable link to SLA violation/fulfillment.

Because the structural compliance is perfect, but the rationale is less precise than the ground truth, a two-point deduction is justified.
