The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the key modification (changing `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" for Task_CollectEquipment) matching the ground truth's core change, and provides a valid one-sentence rationale aligned with SLA improvement goals; however, it loses points for including unnecessary context lines in the unified diff (deviating from the minimal single-hunk format in the ground truth), minor wording differences in the rationale (e.g., lack of explicit "3-day SLA" reference and use of words like "five/two" instead of numerals), and slight over-inclusion of surrounding unchanged elements, which under strict evaluation constitute small but notable deviations.
