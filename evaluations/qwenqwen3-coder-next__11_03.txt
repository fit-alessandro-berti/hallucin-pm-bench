5.0

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of memo score)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst based on joint SLA breaches (+300s/+300s/+60s absolute) and high waits (600s/480s/200s). Provides accurate throughput vs. SLA numbers. Uses bullet points for recommendations. Approx. 150 words. No absent activities/metrics invented. Stays within memo format.
- **Major deductions (strict per instructions)**:
  - **Format violation (-2.0)**: Uses bullet points (`- **Risk Review**:` etc.) for activity identification, explicitly against "Use **bullet points only for the recommendations**."
  - **Quantification mismatch (-1.5)**: Reports "% over SLA" (100%/50%/25%) instead of absolute excess ("+300 s"/"+300 s"/"+60 s") as required by "quantifies by how much each activity exceeds its SLA" and matching ground truth. Percentages are derived, not supplied data.
  - **Invented/derived metrics (-1.0)**: Adds unprovided "% of total cycle time" (80%/67%/67%) for waits; "total cycle time" undefined in data, violates "Ground every sentence in the data... do NOT invent... metrics."
  - **Different recommendations (-1.0)**: Completely divergent actions (e.g., "parallel risk-score validation" vs. GT's "add one risk analyst"; specific invented projections like "≥30%"/"≤450s"/"≤120s" not data-driven or matching GT).
  - **Structural/style differences (-0.5)**: No "To/From"; sensational subject ("Urgent... concerns"); orders activities by % over vs. GT's absolute/queue priority.
- Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 5.0. Core content aligns ~50%, but strict prompt/GT fidelity lost on format, inventions, and mismatches.
