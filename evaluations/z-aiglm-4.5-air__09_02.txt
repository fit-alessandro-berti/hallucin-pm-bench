The LLM answer accurately identifies that the average cycle time for "Dual Authorization" cannot be calculated due to the absence of timestamp data, aligning with the core reasoning in the ground truth. However, the explanation could be more explicit by mentioning that only event counts are available and specifically connecting this to the inability to calculate start-to-completion intervals, as in the ground truth. This minor omission results in a slight deduction.
