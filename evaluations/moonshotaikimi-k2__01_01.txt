### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major partial match, but incomplete; ~60% alignment)**: The LLM correctly identifies the triage validation and amount-based branching as key decisions, aligning with the process description. However, it fails to fully summarize *every* decision point with branching logic/outcomes, as required. Specifically:
  - It lists `Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility` as a decision but omits the explicit rejection branch for ineligible claims (ground truth details "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → rejected").
  - It treats `Finance_Controller_PreApprove` as a decision but does not mention potential rejection (ground truth includes a "Final payment approval" decision covering approval/rejection at PreApprove *and* Auditor Review).
  - The high-value branch is accurately described, but the LLM misses inferring the Auditor Review as a separate decision point with approval/rejection implications (per constraints, payment requires both to "succeed").
  - Presentation is list-based without the ground truth's structured table, reducing clarity. This incompleteness on implicit rejections (critical for a full summary) warrants a significant deduction (~3 points lost for missing branches and underspecifying approvals).
  
- **Required Documents (strong match; ~95% alignment)**: The list is complete and accurate, matching all artefacts from the process description (no introductions of undefined items). Minor issues: Added explanatory parentheses (e.g., "provided by the customer") are not in the ground truth and slightly expand beyond a plain list, though they are factually correct and derived from context. The note on AuditTrail's conditional use is similar to ground truth but phrased differently (no major loss, ~0.5 point deduction for stylistic deviation).

- **Overall Adherence to Prompt**: No introduction of undefined activities/artefacts (e.g., no legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide"). The response is concise and on-topic, but strictness demands full coverage of decisions with outcomes—omissions reduce score. Total: Strong on documents, weaker on decision depth.
