1.0

The LLM answer is completely incorrect:

- For Q1, it answers "No," stating that T5 cannot fire before T3, which directly contradicts the ground truth answer ("Yes").
- For Q2, instead of providing a firing sequence if "yes" or a correct explanation based on the actual net structure, the LLM gives a faulty explanation rooted in its previous incorrect answer and also incorrectly claims both T3 and T7 require P2, which further confuses the process.

Given that the LLM’s response does not match the correct logic, gives the wrong answer to the core question, and fails to provide the minimal sequence, it deserves the lowest possible score. Even minute errors should be penalized—here, the errors are fundamental and critical.
