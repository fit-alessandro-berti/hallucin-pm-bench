9.0

- The LLM answer matches the ground truth in substance and conciseness for all three questions.
  - For Q1, it lists the number of cases and their values instead of just the count. This is informative but slightly deviates from the requested concise style ("3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"), since it explicitly says "3 distinct cases are present: ..." instead of just the number.
  - For Q2, the answer is perfectly concise and correct.
  - For Q3, the answer is correct and concise.

The only minor imperfection is the slight deviation from the expected answer format in Q1. According to the instructions to be "utmost strict," this warrants a small penalty even though the information is correct. Hence: **9.0**.
