The LLM answer is semantically correct and aligns closely with the ground truth on all questions, with proper identification of cases, the preceding activity for C456 (verified via chronological sorting: Pack_Items at 09:35 precedes Ship_Order at 09:40), and the unique activity (Cancel_Order appears once). It uses concise bullet points as required. Minor deductions for slight verbosity in Q2 (full sentence vs. ground truth's minimal label) and added "distinct" in Q1, which are stylistic differences but not substantive errors under strict evaluation.
