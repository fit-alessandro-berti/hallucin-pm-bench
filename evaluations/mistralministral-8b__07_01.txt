### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: Major error â€“ LLM only identified one task (`check_vip`), omitting `generate_qr` entirely, which is a clear addition in v2 (replaces `send_rma_label` in flow). Format deviates: uses id only with "(BPMN_v2)" instead of name with `(id = ...)`. This alone warrants severe deduction (partial credit for identifying one item).
- **Removed tasks**: Content correct (`send_rma_label`), but format incorrect: uses id with "(BPMN_v1)" instead of name with `(id = ...)`. Minor but counts as error under strictness.
- **Gateway type changes**: Mostly accurate (`gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), but format imprecise: specifies "(BPMN_v2)" instead of "(v1)" and "(v2)"; lacks exact ground truth phrasing. No other categories mentioned, which is fine.
- **Overall**: Headings use markdown ("###") not matching prompt's plain "**Added tasks**" style. No "(none)" or speculation, which is positive, but incompleteness and formatting inconsistencies reduce score significantly. Ground truth has 3 total items; LLM has ~2.25 equivalent (one missing), yielding ~50-60% match, adjusted down for strictness to 40%.
