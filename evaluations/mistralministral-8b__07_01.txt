6.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies one added task (**check_vip**) but misses the second new task (**generate_qr**).
- The removed task (**send_rma_label**) is correctly noted.
- The gateway type change is correctly identified with element name and old/new types.
- However, the LLM answer omits the “generate_qr” task entirely, which is a significant factual omission per the prompt's requirements.
- The reporting format is close, but does not use the task “name” (only the id), which is a minor formatting difference. However, the main issue is the missing added task.
- According to the strict criteria (“even small errors should reflect in significant loss of points”), omitting an added task is a major error.

Thus, a score of 6.0 is warranted.
