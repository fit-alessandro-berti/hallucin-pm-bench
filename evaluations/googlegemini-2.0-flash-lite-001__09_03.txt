The LLM answer correctly identifies that the calculation is impossible due to insufficient dataâ€”all event data, including relevant timestamps, are missing. It clearly states that the absence of actual event data prevents computation of the requested metrics.

However, it omits explicitly mentioning that all case rows and timestamps are redacted (as called out in the ground truth), and does not state that additional log entries would be required. There is also no direct restatement that neither average, standard deviation, nor confidence interval can be computed without any data.

These small omissions mean the answer is slightly less thorough than the ground truth, warranting a deduction. Nonetheless, the core reasoning and conclusion are correct.
