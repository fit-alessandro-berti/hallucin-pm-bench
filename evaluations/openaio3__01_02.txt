### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% of Score Weight)**: The LLM answer incorrectly identifies and expands non-decision steps as "decision points," introducing fabricated outcomes (e.g., "stop the file" at KYC or "hold or close" at NFC) not present in the process flow. The ground truth strictly limits to three true branching points: Underwriter Alignment Gate (escalate/continue), Amount Threshold Decision (auto-approve/board), and MBA (approve/reject). The LLM's inclusion of KYC and NFC as decisions violates the prompt's focus on actual decision points, uses inexact phrasing (e.g., "move on to NFC" instead of direct "continue"), and adds unnecessary flow details. This is a fundamental deviation, warranting severe deduction (partial credit only for correctly naming and partially describing the three core points).
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors, ~40% of Score Weight)**: The list is complete and matches the ground truth exactly in content and order. However, small phrasing inconsistencies (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "CIS template" vs. "CIS") introduce unnecessary variations, and the LLM omits the ground truth's explanatory note on exclusions (though this is minor). Strict evaluation deducts slightly for imperfect fidelity.

Overall, the response fails to adhere to the prompt's precision on decision points, introducing errors that alter the process summary, while documents are near-perfect.
