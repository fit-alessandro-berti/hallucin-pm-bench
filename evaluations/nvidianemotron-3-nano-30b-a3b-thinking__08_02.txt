The LLM answer is factually correct, provides the exact same minimal sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] demonstrating T5 firing before T3, and a valid concise explanation matching the ground truth's logic (P2 token available via alternative path to P5). Minor deductions for: lacking step-by-step markings (ground truth verifies each precisely), not structuring as explicit **Q1/Q2**, calling it "shortest reachable" vs. "minimal" (semantically similar but not identical phrasing), and integrated rather than separated format. No factual errors; under 120 words. High match, but strictness penalizes detail/presentation differences.
