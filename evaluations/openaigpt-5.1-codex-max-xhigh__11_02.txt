**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), which are unambiguously the poorest by key metrics (wait time, throughput drop, processing time, rework, SLA breaches). Explanations are strictly table-based, accurate (e.g., 150 min wait, 22% rework, 12.4% SLA), and cite relevant data without hallucination or external invention. Concise (<200 words), data-driven recommendations address observed issues (e.g., rework/queue for Request_Documents).
- **Weaknesses (deductions for differences)**: 
  - Format: Bullet-list titled as "Key under-performers" vs. GT's formal "Executive Memo" with intro, numbered list, bolded metrics, and closing projection (-0.5).
  - Recommendations violate "one concrete... action" by using compound phrasing (e.g., Request_Documents has standardize/checklist **plus** staffing adjustment; Review has checklist/sessions **and** re-balance; Initial has capacity/triage **and** tighten criteria) vs. GT's single integrated actions (-1.0).
  - Minor phrasing: "Among remaining steps" implies less clarity on #3 than GT's confident "three clear... hotspots"; extra details like stdev (valid but not emphasized in GT) and explicit throughput arrows (inferred accurately but additive) (-0.3).
- Overall: High fidelity to task/prompt (95% content match), but strict rubric penalizes structural/precise deviations significantly. No policy violations.
