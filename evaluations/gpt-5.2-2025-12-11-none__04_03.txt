The LLM answer is factually correct (correctly identifies "No" compliance due to Rule 3 violation, accurately assesses all rules with matching reasoning), but loses points for format/style differences from ground truth: bullet list vs. table; concise "**No.**" vs. "**No – the trace is not compliant.**"; minor phrasing variances (e.g., Rule 1 explicitly notes both activities "once" vs. implied; Rule 3 "after QE but before RA" vs. "before RA is completed; must wait until both"; no explicit final summary sentence); lacks table symbols (✔/❌). Strict evaluation deducts ~0.8 for these non-trivial presentation mismatches despite semantic equivalence.
