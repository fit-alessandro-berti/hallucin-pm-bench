7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, it loses points for incompleteness and minor formatting deviations from the ground truth:
- **Added/Removed tasks**: Lists only IDs (e.g., "check_vip"), omitting the exact `name` attributes from the XML (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status"), which are factual elements of the task definitions. The ground truth includes both for precision, making this a significant omission under "use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML" (interpreting "names" as the `name` attribute). This alone deducts ~2 points for lack of full detail.
- **Gateway type changes**: Content is accurate but lacks the ground truth's explicit versioning ("(v1)" and "(v2)"), which adds factual clarity without speculation. Minor deduction (~0.5 points).
- **Formatting**: Matches the prompt's bullet style (â€¢ and -) better than the ground truth's (**bold** and *), but differs from ground truth (no backticks, no extra note). This is a small mismatch but contributes to ~0.5 points loss under strict comparison.
- No speculation or extraneous content, which is positive, but overall strictness for differences (especially missing names) prevents a higher score. No other categories (e.g., no false additions) are mishandled.
