6.5

- The LLM answer lists the correct IDs for the added/removed tasks and correctly detects the gateway type change.  
- However, it fails to include the task name and id together, as given in the ground truth (which is stricter and includes both).  
- In the "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" headings, it omits the human-readable task names and whether they're grouped as bullet points or asterisks.  
- The gateway type change is correct in both content and format, though the ground truth bolds the gateway types and includes a period after the description, which the LLM answer omits.  
- The LLM answer uses hyphens instead of the required bullet/asterisk formatting.  
- It also omits the indication that there are no other differences ("(No other differences should be reported.)"), though that's a minor formality.

These formatting and completeness lapses, while not errors in the detection of changes themselves, reflect a significant loss of points under "utmost strictness".
