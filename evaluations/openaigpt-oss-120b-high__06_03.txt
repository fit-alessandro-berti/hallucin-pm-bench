The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in the exact order they appear in Process B, with no extraneous information about other processes or irrelevant details. This matches the ground truth's core content precisely. However, it loses points for stylistic and formatting differences: lacking descriptive labels (e.g., "Set 1 – first parallel block:"), using an em dash (‑‑) instead of the parallel symbol (‖), no backticks around task names, and omitting the concluding sentence ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel"). Under strict evaluation, these presentational variances constitute small but notable deviations from the ground truth, warranting a moderate deduction.
