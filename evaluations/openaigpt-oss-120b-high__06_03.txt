The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks in Process B and lists them in the correct order, matching the ground truth answer in substance. However, the answer omits any explicit labelling (e.g., "Set 1 â€“ first parallel block") and does not include the explicit statement that "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," which is present in the ground truth. While the omission does not fundamentally alter the factual correctness regarding the concurrent tasks, strict grading requires a significant point deduction for missing those small but nontrivial details.
