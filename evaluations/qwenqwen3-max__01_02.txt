6.0

### Evaluation Reasoning
I evaluated the LLM answer against the ground truth with utmost strictness, focusing on factual accuracy, completeness, adherence to the prompt's instructions (e.g., using exact terminology, summarizing only decision points without introducing extras, and listing documents precisely), and minimal differences in content/structure. Differences, even small, result in significant point deductions. The score reflects substantial issues in the decision points section, partially offset by strong alignment in the documents section.

#### Decision Points (Major Issues: -3.0 deduction from base 10.0)
- **Extra inclusion of Quick KYC Verification (KYC) as a decision point**: The ground truth identifies exactly three decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval), which correspond to the process's explicit branching/approval steps (steps 5, 7, and 8). The LLM incorrectly adds KYC (step 2) as the first decision point, describing it as a halting verification. While KYC implies a pass/fail, the ground truth and prompt's focus on "decision points" (branching/escalation gates) exclude it, making this an invention of non-standard content. This violates the prompt's "use exactly the activity names given; do not introduce..." and creates a structural mismatch (LLM has 4 points vs. GT's 3).
- **Incomplete flow specification**: Ground truth explicitly positions decisions (e.g., Alignment Gate "after the Dual Underwriter Split"; Amount Threshold "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). The LLM implies flow but omits these anchors, e.g., Amount Threshold lacks "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check," reducing precision.
- **Minor rephrasing and additions**: For Amount Threshold, LLM says "< €15 000, auto-approve → proceed to Disburse Funds" (introduces direct link to step 9, not in GT) vs. GT's "system auto-approves" (neutral). Alignment Gate is mostly accurate but adds "before continuing" (unnecessary elaboration). MBA description is close but capitalizes "*approve* or *reject*" inconsistently with GT's "**Approve** or **Reject**". Title adds "(May 2025)" (from process description but not in GT/prompt summary request).
- These errors inflate the summary with extraneous details, deviate from GT's concise structure (no extra verification step, explicit "branch after" phrasing), and risk introducing "standard loan terminology" vibes (e.g., halting on KYC feels like typical KYC gates).

#### Required Documents (Minor Issues: -1.0 deduction)
- **Core list matches**: Both include all six exact items from the prompt, using precise names without additions (no standard loan docs introduced, aligning with prompt).
- **Small wording/phrasing differences** (significant under strictness):
  - Proof of Address: GT "≤ 3 months"; LLM "≤ 3 months old" (extra "old" alters phrasing slightly).
  - Latest Income Statement: GT "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; LLM "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" (adds "single" (unnecessary per prompt's "single pay-stub or tax slip"), changes "/" to "or").
  - Community Impact Statement: GT "(CIS)"; LLM "(CIS) template" (extra "template" from prompt, but GT omits it, creating a difference).
- **Omitted note**: GT includes explanatory note "*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*", reinforcing the non-standard process. LLM omits this, missing completeness.
- **Formatting**: GT uses numbered list; LLM uses bullets. Both are clear, but inconsistency with GT's structure is a minor deduction.

#### Overall Strengths (Supporting the 6.0 Base)
- Faithful to prompt: Uses exact activity names (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Harmonisation Committee"), no standard terminology introduced.
- Concise and structured: Clear sections, bolding for readability (though GT uses markdown headers).
- No major omissions: Covers all GT decision points, just with extras.

This score penalizes the erroneous expansion of decision points heavily (core to the summary task) while acknowledging near-perfect documents. A perfect match would require zero additions/omissions and exact phrasing/positioning.
