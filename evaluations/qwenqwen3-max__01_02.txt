6.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM correctly identifies the three true "decision points" from the process: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- The list of required documents is complete and the naming matches almost exactly.
- Standard loan terminology is indeed avoided.

**Errors and Omissions:**

1. **Incorrect/Inappropriate Inclusion as a Decision Point:**
   - The LLM claims "Quick KYC Verification" is a decision point where "failure halts process". This is not defined as a decision point in the ground truth; it's a verification/gating activity, not a process branch or approval event. Introducing it is a clear deviation from the required focus.
   
2. **Omission of Explicit Process Flow Placement:**
   - The ground truth is careful to place the decision points at their correct location ("after Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), but the LLM omits this explicit placement, making the process less clear.

3. **Less Precise Language:**
   - The LLM says "proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check" after the Underwriter Alignment Gate. This is correct, but the original prompt expects step-wise explicitness.
   - For the Amount Threshold Decision, the wording is similar but less formulaic than the ground truth.
   - For "Final Micro-loan Board Approval", the LLM’s wording is substantially correct.

4. **Required Documents:**
   - LLM includes the (correct) list and names, but adds "(exact names)", which is minor but not necessary.

5. **Failure to Note Exclusions:**
   - The ground truth explicitly clarifies that “No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed”. The LLM does not include this, missing an important detail about distinguishing features versus standard processes.

**Weighting of Errors:**
- Introducing an incorrect decision point and failing to mention the exclusion of standard documents are significant accuracy losses.
- Minor losses for less precise process flow descriptions.

**Strict-scoring Conclusion:**
A stricter score reflects errors in process mapping (decision point definition) and the omission of explicitly required distinguishing remarks. Thus: **6.0**.
