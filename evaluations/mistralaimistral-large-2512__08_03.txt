**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" and the critical shortcut path via T2b allowing T5 to enable/fire without prior T3, providing a valid prefix sequence (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5) with solid observations and explanation. However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:

- **Major difference in firing sequence**: LLM provides a 4-step sequence stopping at T5 (sufficient for T5 firing sans prior T3 but incomplete for demonstrating "T5 fires *before* T3" if interpreting as requiring both events with ordering, as GT does explicitly via full 6-step 〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉). GT presents/claims the 6-step as "shortest [...] that achieves this order" and proves minimality (lower bound 4 + T6/T3 required for pc token post-T5).
- **Missing elements**: No step-by-step markings (GT has detailed table); no mention/explanation of T6 feedback loop re-enabling T3 after T5 (core to GT's "why this works" and minimality proof); LLM claims 4-step as "shortest" without addressing full ordering or loop necessity.
- **Structural/verbosity gaps**: LLM concise but lacks GT's formal proof of no shorter full sequence, arrow markings, and explicit "T5 fired before T3" annotation mid-sequence.

These are significant differences (wrong claimed shortness, incomplete sequence for ordering proof, omitted details), warranting deduction despite strong core logic (~30% mismatch). No factual errors, but strictness demands near-exact alignment.
