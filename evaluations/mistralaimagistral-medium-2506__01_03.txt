7.0

**Evaluation:**

a) Decision Points  
- The LLM answer is accurate in capturing both decision points.  
- For the skip condition, the description is correct and clear.  
- For the TriVote, the rule is stated as "at least two out of three," matching the process requirement.  
- Minor issue: The LLM slightly rewords the committee roles as "roles" rather than "approvers," and doesn’t restate that “Sustainability Officer” approval is always required for participation—though the decision rule itself is not materially misstated.

b) Documents List  
- The LLM lists the following in order:
  1. Form 14B
  2. Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow (groups as one; the ground truth lists as separate items)
  3. Deck Memo
  4. Offer Sheet 77
  5. ID Matrix Declaration (gives this before "Signed Offer Sheet 77", but these are both required at step 8, so only minor)
  6. Loan Dossier 2025

**Errors:**
- **Key error**: “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is not listed as a distinct document; instead, “Offer Sheet 77” alone is present, and only “Signed” is referenced as part of step 8. The process clearly distinguishes between the offer prepared in step 7 and the signed sheet returned in step 8. This is a structural omission.
- **Grouping issue**: Lists the three Scorecards as a single bullet, not separately, which is a deviation from the required exhaustive list.
- Lists "ID Matrix Declaration" and Offer Sheet 77 together for step 8, when process requires two documents: the "Signed Offer Sheet 77" and "ID Matrix Declaration" as separate entries.
- **Omission:** The answer has only 6 items; ground truth has 9. Omits Signed Offer Sheet 77 as a separate document and does not enumerate the 3 scorecards separately.

**Strictness Penalty:**  
- The answer summarizes decision points well, but the document list does not faithfully enumerate all as distinct and in the required granularity, especially missing the separate “Signed Offer Sheet 77” and grouping the scorecards.  
- These are not minor clerical issues, but show the LLM failed to “List **all** documents... in the order they first appear”, as requested.

**Conclusion:**  
Accurate on decision point logic but significant flaw in document listing; thus, 7.0.
