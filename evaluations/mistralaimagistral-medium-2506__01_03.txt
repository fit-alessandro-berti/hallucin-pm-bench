### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two decision points with high fidelity to the prompt and ground truth. The summaries are concise (one sentence each) and capture the core rules accurately, with only minor phrasing differences (e.g., "skip step 5" vs. explicitly noting the "otherwise" branch; "must be approved by at least two" vs. "at least two ... record 'Approve'"). No hallucinations or omissions. This earns near-full marks (9.5/10 for this section).
- **Part (b)**: Significant errors in completeness and structure. The ground truth lists 9 distinct document references in first-appearance order, treating the three Scorecards as separate items (2–4) and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct entry (7) from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" (6). The LLM bundles the Scorecards into one item (reducing the list to 6 entries) and merges the signed Offer Sheet into the ID Matrix Declaration description without listing it separately, underrepresenting the total documents. Extra annotations (e.g., step references, KYC note) add unrequested detail, though the KYC note aligns with the process and avoids hallucination. These omissions and bundling deviate substantially from the ground truth's strict enumeration, warranting a major deduction (4/10 for this section).
- **Overall**: Weighted average reflects strictness—strong on (a), weak on (b)'s precise listing. No policy violations or jailbreaks in the LLM response.
