**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to (and arguably superior to) the ground truth, faithfully modeling all explicitly mentioned flow elements per the prompt—including the required "checks warranty eligibility" task (omitted in ground truth)—with no extras, hallucinations, or omissions. It uses exactly the specified gateways, exactly two end events, wrc_-prefixed IDs on all elements, and verbatim task names (e.g., "validates the claim", "checks warranty eligibility", "send rejection notice"). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., descriptive IDs/conditionExpressions vs. short IDs/flow labels; casing exact to prompt vs. title-case in ground truth; additional valid namespaces; process attributes) are permitted by the rubric for semantic equivalence and do not violate requirements. The flow structure precisely matches the process description, including the validation loop and parallel activities. No deductions warranted under strict rubric criteria.
