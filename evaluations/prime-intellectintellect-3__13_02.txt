**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct and complete. Numerics match ground truth exactly (Q1: 1; 2a: 2.08%; 2b: 8.33%). Q3 meets all criteria strictly: (i) specifies single occurrence (1/48 events, 1/12 cases); (ii) notes instability/variance (skewing metrics via outliers, incorrect models); (iii) cautions over-generalization (mislead analyses, biased conclusions from slice, needs larger samples). ≤100 words (68). No inventions, errors, or extraneous content; format enhances clarity without violation.
