**9.5**

The LLM answer is factually perfect, covers all three cases with identical evidence (reversed order in 1001/1003; absence of Update_Inventory in 1002 disproving "always"), cites cases/activities/timestamps as required, and correctly deems the fact inaccurate. Minor deductions for stylistic differences vs. ground truth: lacks line references (uses timestamps instead), no explicit "in none of the cases" summary or "reversed"/"not after it" phrasing, slightly different structure/formatting (e.g., no "Short verdict" header), and "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate"/"false". No factual errors or omissions under strict evaluation.
