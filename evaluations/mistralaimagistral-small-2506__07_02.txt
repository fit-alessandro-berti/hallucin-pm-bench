The LLM answer is mostly accurate, but has small deviations from the ground truth that merit a significant deduction given the required strictness:

- **Added tasks:** Correctly identifies all three added tasks.
- **Removed tasks:** Correctly identifies `Task_RejectLoan`, but unnecessarily comments that it is a "renamed/replaced by `Task_FinalReject`". The instruction was to ignore cosmetic renamings; this phrasing could be misleading or incorrect if "Final Reject" is not a direct rename. The expected answer just lists the removed task name without speculation.
- **Gateway-type changes:** Correctly identifies the gateway change from Exclusive to Inclusive and gives appropriate IDs. However, mentioning "new condition branches" (`eligible`, `missing docs`, `ineligible` vs `yes`/`no`) is out-of-scope (the instruction is to ignore cosmetic/semantic labeling changes and summarise strictly only gateway-type changes). Only the type change is required under this heading.

**Deduction reasoning:**  
-1 point for the speculative/extra commentary under "Removed tasks" (uncalled-for discussion of renaming/replacement).
-1 point for exceeding requirements under "Gateway-type changes" (listing sequence flow label changes and semantical interpretation not asked).
