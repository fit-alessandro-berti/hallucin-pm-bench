5.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (partial match, 2.0/3.0)**: Correctly identifies the three added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), but lists only IDs without the descriptive names (e.g., "Verify Identity") as in the ground truth, violating the strict summary format. This is a small but notable omission under utmost strictness.
- **Removed tasks (poor match, 0.5/3.0)**: Identifies the correct task (Task_RejectLoan) but incorrectly describes it as "renamed/replaced by Task_FinalReject." This introduces a factual error, as the instructions explicitly require ignoring cosmetic renamings, and the IDs/names confirm it's a removal (not a rename). Task_FinalReject is a separate addition, not a replacementâ€”blurring categories significantly lowers the score.
- **Gateway-type changes (good match but with extras, 2.5/4.0)**: Correctly notes the change from Exclusive to Inclusive for Gateway_Decision, aligning with the example. However, it adds extraneous details (e.g., "New condition branches" and semantic note), which go beyond "gateway-type changes" into flow/condition analysis. The ground truth is strictly limited to the type shift (with XOR/OR notation), so this verbosity deducts points for not adhering to the exact heading scope.
- **Overall structure and strictness (-1.0 total)**: Uses the exact headings but with inconsistent formatting (e.g., bolding and numbering differ slightly). Fails to ignore non-relevant changes (flows/branches) and introduces interpretive errors, leading to significant point loss per the criteria. No other changes (e.g., name updates like "Review Application" or "Approve Loan") are mentioned, which is correct, but the errors above prevent a higher score.
