The LLM answer precisely mirrors the ground truth in structure, content, and reasoning: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to redacted data (no rows or timestamps), specifies the impact on the requested metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, confidence interval), remains concise in one short paragraph, avoids guessing or external knowledge, and adheres to the task's instructions without unnecessary additions or errors. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., referencing the SLA catalogue, which is factual but not emphasized in ground truth) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they do not alter the core explanation.
