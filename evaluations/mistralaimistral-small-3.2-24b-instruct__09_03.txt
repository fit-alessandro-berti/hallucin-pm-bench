9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the requested metrics cannot be computed due to the absence of event data—mirroring the core reasoning in the ground truth. The answer is precise, emphatically explains that only headers are present in Artefact A, and that Artefact B's KPI data isn't sufficient. The reasoning is accurate and does not speculate or introduce external knowledge.

However, compared to the ground truth, the answer is slightly more verbose and less direct. The ground truth answer is more concise ("Impossible — the necessary data are absent.") before expanding, whereas the LLM's phrasing ("Given the provided artefacts, it is impossible...") is a little less crisp. Additionally, the LLM explicitly mentions "no statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, or confidence intervals) can be performed," which, while correct, is a touch redundant in context. These minor stylistic and directness differences warrant a modest deduction.

Overall, the LLM answer demonstrates full comprehension and rationale but is not quite as succinct and direct as the ground truth—hence 9.0.
