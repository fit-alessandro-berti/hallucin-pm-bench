**9.0**

The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying the fact as false with precise counterexamples from Cases 1001 and 1003 (reverse ordering, with timestamps matching the log). It matches the ground truth verdict ("not accurate" ≈ "inaccurate") and core evidence on order reversal. Minor deductions for: (1) different handling of Case 1002 (LLM correctly notes it as non-contradictory under a strict precedence reading, while GT treats absence as disproof—interpretive difference but not erroneous); (2) no line citations (timestamps are equivalent/precise); (3) small typo ("Authorize_REFUND" vs. "Authorize_Refund"); (4) slightly longer/more explanatory than GT's concise bullets; (5) structure lacks "Short verdict" phrasing. Under utmost strictness, these warrant -1.0 total, but substance is 95%+ aligned.
