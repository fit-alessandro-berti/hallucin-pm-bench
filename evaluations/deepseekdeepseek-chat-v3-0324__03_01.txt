### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the high-level process flow and loop correctly (e.g., password reset bypass, forward-to-specialist leading to resolve, confirmation loop back to diagnosis), aligning with the description's 10 lines and using concise IDs. However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions apply for multiple violations of the prompt's "exactly as stated" rule, no inventions, and output format:

- **Output format violation (-2.0)**: Prompt requires *only* a single `<definitions> … </definitions>` block (≤40 lines). LLM prepends explanatory text ("Here's the BPMN...") and appends "Key features:" with bullet points, adding non-XML content.
- **Invented elements and improper modeling (-2.0)**: 
  - Uses specific task subtypes (`<serviceTask>`, `<userTask>`) instead of generic `<task>` (GT uses `<task>` for all; prompt mentions no types like "service" or "user," so specifying them invents details).
  - Exclusive gateways lack proper `<conditionExpression>` on outgoing flows (BPMN 2.0 standard for XOR decisions); LLM relies on informal `name` attributes (e.g., "Password Reset" on f3), which doesn't implement decision logic correctly and deviates from GT's yes/no expressions.
  - Three gateways (gw1, gw2, gw3) modeled, but prompt specifies marking *two* decision points—LLM (and even GT) exceeds this, but LLM's extra gw3 without proper conditions amplifies the invention.
- **Minor but penalizable differences (-1.0)**: Name mismatches (e.g., "Classify Ticket" vs. GT's "Auto-Classification," reflecting "automatically classified"; unnamed start/end/gateways vs. GT's descriptive names like "Ticket Submitted"). Missing `< ?xml>` declaration and `targetNamespace` (GT includes them for valid BPMN). Flow names like "Confirmed" are added inventions not in description.
- **No major hallucinations** (+1.0 partial credit): Avoids adding unmentioned elements (e.g., no timers, escalations, extra tasks like "Approve Closure"), keeps ≤40 lines, and models loop exactly as line 9 states.

Overall, the XML is parsable and structurally close but not "exact" or valid BPMN for decisions, warranting a low score despite correct intent. Small errors (names, attributes) compound to significant loss per instructions.
