**3.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately flags the core violation (Rule 3: NA before RA). It also correctly notes Rule 4 satisfaction. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major errors (significant deductions):** Wrongly claims Rule 1 violated by inventing a "immediately after QE, no activities in between" requirement (Rule 1 only requires order and once each; QE precedes RA, so satisfied). Wrongly claims Rule 2 violated (VP is after both QE/RA, so satisfied; mixes in Rule 3 issue irrelevantly).
- **Minor issues (further deductions):** Overstates violations (claims 1,2,3 vs. only 3); adds unsubstantiated "strictly preserved" sequence; structure deviates from ground truth's precise per-rule table without checkmarks.
- Matches ~50% of ground truth assessments but with factual inaccuracies and misinterpretations, warranting low score despite correct headline answer.
