### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer adheres to the vocabulary policy correctly (using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly, with no forbidden terms). The matrix structure is present with no extra tasks, roles, or columns, and the key explanation is a minor addition but not entirely unwarranted. However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth, there are multiple significant errors in RACI assignments and formatting, violating the core requirement for precise reflection of the narrative-derived allocations (e.g., separation of R and A where intended, exact roles like Consulted vs. Informed). These include:

- **Receive Application**: CO assigned "I" (LLM) vs. "C" (ground truth) – incorrect consultation role.
- **KYC Review**: AM "I" vs. "A"; CO "R/A" vs. "R"; FC "I" vs. "C" – three errors, including improper combination of R/A and missing accountability/consultation.
- **Order Vetting**: Matches closely (minor formatting diff: "R/A" vs. "R / A").
- **Payment Clearance**: AM "I" vs. "A"; FC "R/A" vs. "R" – two errors, mishandling accountability and improper R/A combination.
- **Record Update**: IT "R/A" vs. "R" – incorrect addition of A where only R is specified.
- **Notify Customer**: Matches closely.

This results in ~7/24 cells with substantive differences (29% error rate), plus consistent formatting inconsistencies (e.g., "R/A" without spaces, added abbreviations in headers, inconsistent bolding). The added notes introduce minor self-explanation not present in ground truth, slightly inflating unwarranted content. Each mismatch deducts heavily due to strictness, yielding a low score despite correct terminology and overall format.
