8.0

**Evaluation:**

*Vocabulary adherence:*  
- All mandated terminology is followed: “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance” are used correctly and forbidden terms are absent. ✅

*Activity and column structure:*  
- No extra roles/tasks—matches the six required activities and four roles. ✅

*RACI assignments:*
- **Receive Application:**  
  - LLM: AM (R/A), CO (I), FC (I), IT (I).  
  - Ground Truth: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I).  
  - **Error:** Missing "C" (Consulted) for CO.

- **KYC Review:**  
  - LLM: CO (R/A), AM (I), FC (I), IT (I).  
  - Ground Truth: CO (R), AM (A), FC (C), IT (I).  
  - **Error:** LLM collapses R/A for CO instead of splitting R (CO) and A (AM). CO is not *Accountable* per ground truth, and AM should be *A*, not *I*. FC "C" is demoted to "I".

- **Order Vetting:**  
  - Both: AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I). ✅

- **Payment Clearance:**  
  - LLM: FC (R/A), CO (C), AM (I), IT (I).  
  - Ground Truth: FC (R), AM (A), CO (C), IT (I).  
  - **Error:** LLM gives R/A to FC only.

- **Record Update:**  
  - LLM: IT (R/A), AM (C), FC (C), CO (I).  
  - Ground Truth: IT (R), AM (C), FC (C), CO (I).  
  - **Error:** LLM gives R/A to IT (ground truth: only R).

- **Notify Customer:**  
  - Both: AM (R/A), others (I). ✅

*Key RACI Distinctions Missed:*  
- The LLM answer routinely merges Responsible (R) and Accountable (A) into a single R/A role, where ground truth wants them separated (especially for CO in KYC and FC in Payment Clearance).
- For “KYC Review”, the important distinction that AM is Accountable and CO is Responsible is lost.
- Consulted (C) is sometimes omitted or replaced with Informed (I).
- Accountable (A) is sometimes not present where it should be, or assigned to the wrong party.

*Other notes:*  
- Uses a non-canonical “R/A” (combining roles). Ground truth treats “R” and “A” as possibly distinct.
- The explanation and table structure are otherwise correct; no forbidden terms.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer is visually compliant and major terminology rules are perfectly followed. However, it fails strict compliance in RACI assignments (merges R/A when they should be distinct, omits some C and A assignments, notably in KYC Review and Payment Clearance), which is a substantial flaw for an expert-level prompt. These errors warrant a significant deduction, but not failure—thus, **8.0**.
