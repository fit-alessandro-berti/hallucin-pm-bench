The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides accurate justification by citing the relevant counterexamples (C002 and C004) with precise activity sequences, directly addressing the "always" claim. It also appropriately notes the cases where the sequence holds (C001 and C003) for completeness, relying solely on the log evidence. However, under utmost strictness, it loses a full point for lacking the exhaustive case-by-case structure (e.g., no table or explicit per-case verification for all instances, as in the ground truth), making it slightly less meticulous in presentation despite content accuracy.
