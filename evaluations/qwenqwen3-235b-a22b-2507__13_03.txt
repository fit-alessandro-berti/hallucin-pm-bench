5.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Question 1 (Score: 10.0/10.0)**: Exact match to ground truth—correctly identifies 1 occurrence with no errors or additions.

**Question 2 (Score: 1.0/10.0)**: Major deviations despite ≤120 words (LLM: ~105 words). Fails to address key ground truth elements: quantitative sampling error (e.g., frequency swing 0-7%, wide confidence interval), rare event volatility in tiny sample (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), and data-specific pitfalls like near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing string-matching confusion. Instead, introduces speculation (e.g., high-risk conditions, temporal clustering later in month) violating "no speculation" rule. Generalizes broadly without data-grounded precision, leading to incomplete and misleading explanation. Strict deduction for omissions and violations.

**Overall**: Weighted average, heavily penalized for Q2's substantive errors and speculation (core policy breach).
