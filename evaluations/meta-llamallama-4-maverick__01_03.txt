6.2

**Rationale:**

**a) Decision Points:**
- The LLM correctly identifies both relevant decision points: the conditional branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check, and the "TriVote" approval gate.
- The summary for the risk/amount skip is accurate but not strictly worded as a single, standalone, concise sentence ("The process skips Manual-Underwriting-Review..."). The LLM’s wording is acceptable but slightly less formal and lacks explicit mention that if the *condition is NOT met*, Manual-Underwriting-Review *occurs*.
- For the TriVote gate, the summary is substantially correct (approval requires two out of three), though the wording “the loan is approved if any two out of the three required approvals are obtained” is correct, but weaker than the GT's “the loan may advance only when at least two of three approvers record ‘Approve’.”
- Minor: The LLM never mentions that Sustainability Officer's participation is mandatory. However, it doesn't contradict this either.

**b) Documents:**
- The main fault is failure to include **“Signed Offer Sheet 77”** as a distinct document (step 8), as required by the process (in step 8, both Offer Sheet 77 *and* Signed Offer Sheet 77 are required — the signed version is a separate required document). The LLM only lists Offer Sheet 77 (at step 7, which is correct) but omits the signed version needed for step 8.
- Otherwise, the sequence and all other document names are correct.
- All three “Scorecard” documents are listed as distinct documents — correct.
- No inclusion of hallucinated documents (no KYC, AML, or credit-bureau artifacts) — good.

**Other Considerations:**
- The answer is not strictly concise: it restates answers multiple times and repeats content for both steps a and b (not a major deduction, but does show some lack of precision).
- The answer’s phrasing is somewhat loose (for example, it does not clarify that the Deck Memo only appears in the Manual-Underwriting-Review branch, but this is minor).

**Point Deductions:**
- Omission of “Signed Offer Sheet 77” as its own document is a significant error and should impact the score.
- Some imprecise wording on decision points.
- Lack of conciseness and duplication.

**Conclusion:**  
**6.2** is strict for the above errors, particularly the document omission, but acknowledges that the LLM did not hallucinate steps or documents, captured all major elements, and did not present gross misunderstandings. The answer is above average but clearly incomplete and not to a high standard.
