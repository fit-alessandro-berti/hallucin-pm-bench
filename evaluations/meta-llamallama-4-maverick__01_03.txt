8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part (a) Accuracy (Decision Points)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two decision points and provides concise one-sentence descriptions that closely align with the ground truth. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "skips ... if" vs. "bypasses ... if ... otherwise proceeds"; "approved if any two" vs. "may advance only when at least two ... record 'Approve'") are present but do not alter the core rule, so this is nearly perfect (9.5/10). No hallucinations or extras.
- **Part (b) Accuracy (Documents List)**: The list is mostly correct in order and includes all items except "Signed Offer Sheet 77," which is explicitly required in step 8 as a distinct document (separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7). This omission makes the list incomplete (8/9 items), disrupting the sequence and violating the "all documents" requirementâ€”a clear error under strict evaluation (7.0/10). No hallucinations about absent items like KYC/AML.
- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: The response is organized but verbose with unnecessary intermediate steps; the final summary matches the prompt's format well. Strict deduction for the missing document and phrasing nuances results in an aggregate score of 8.0.
