9.0

**Evaluation:**

- **Q1 (A1):** Answer is **correct**. Both the LLM answer and the ground truth concur that there are 3 distinct cases. **No deduction.**
- **Q2 (A2):** Answer is **correct** with the correct sequence and symbols. **No deduction.**
- **Q3 (A3):** The LLM provides both required activities, uses alphabetical order, and presents one per line as requested. However, there is a semantic issue: the LLM includes an explicit breakdown showing "Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery" for C002, which could confuse a reader into thinking both immediately precede "Ship_Order" together in that case, rather than just the immediate preceding event. The answer list at the bottom, however, is correct and matches the ground truth ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock").  

**Minor deduction (−1.0):** for presenting unnecessary and potentially confusing detail in the explanation for Q3, rather than listing only the immediate predecessor for each "Ship_Order" event, which could be seen as a lack of 100% precision and clarity.

Absolute factual correspondence has been fulfilled in the final answer sections, but utmost strictness and clarity under the instructions justifies dropping to 9.0.
