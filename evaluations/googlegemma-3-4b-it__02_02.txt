5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth ("3"). No errors. Score: 10.0.
- **Q2**: Sequence is factually identical in content and order (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order). Minor formatting difference (ground truth uses escaped underscores like Receive\_Order for display, while LLM uses plain text), but this is negligible as it matches the raw log values. No hallucinations or extras in the final sequence. However, under utmost strictness, the lack of exact escaped formatting deducts slightly. Score: 9.5.
- **Q3**: Distinct activities are correct (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock), and listed one per line. However, the ordering is reversed (Check_Stock before Arrange_Delivery, violating "alphabetically ordered" instruction; correct is A before C). LLM falsely claims "in alphabetical order" while providing the wrong order, introducing a factual inaccuracy. Extra explanatory text (e.g., case breakdowns) is unnecessary and deviates from the concise ground truth format (bulleted list with <br>). These are treated as significant errors/hallucinations in precision. Score: 2.0.

Overall score is a strict weighted average (equal parts per question), heavily penalized for Q3's clear factual and instructional violation, resulting in 5.0.
