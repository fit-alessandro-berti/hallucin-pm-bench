• The LLM answer correctly identifies:
  - The two added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`)
  - The one removed task (`send_rma_label`)
  - The gateway type change for `gw_valid`

• However, the answer does **not** provide the task names as they appear in the XML, only the IDs, while the ground truth includes both the names and IDs. The prompt is strict about using element names as they appear in the XML. Omitting task names is a significant error resulting in an appreciable deduction.

• The LLM answer also fails to follow the **exact formatting** required: bullet point style instead of headings and correct presentation (e.g., missing "**" and parentheses, not matching the exact heading formatting of the ground truth).

Given these gaps—while not fundamentally wrong in the facts—strict grading demands significant loss of points for missing required detail and formatting accuracy.
