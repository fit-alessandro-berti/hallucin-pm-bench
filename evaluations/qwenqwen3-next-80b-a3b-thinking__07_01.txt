6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct identification of changes (strong match, ~80% weight)**: The LLM correctly identifies the added tasks (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive. No extraneous differences are reported, aligning with the ground truth's core facts and the "no other differences" note.
- **Format and heading adherence (partial match, ~10% weight)**: Headings use the required "â€¢ Added tasks" style from the system prompt, which is closer to instructions than the ground truth's bold plain headings. However, list items use "-" bullets instead of "*" italics, a minor but noticeable deviation under strict scrutiny.
- **Content detail and exactness (weak match, ~10% weight)**: Significant deductions for omitting task names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code"), which appear exactly in the XML and are prominently featured in the ground truth with id parentheticals. Listing only IDs is factually incomplete and less informative. Gateway phrasing omits backticks around `gw_valid`, bolding, and explicit (v1)/(v2) versioning, reducing precision despite semantic accuracy.

This score reflects strict evaluation: core logic is sound but presentation errors (especially missing names) warrant a notable penalty, avoiding a near-perfect score.
