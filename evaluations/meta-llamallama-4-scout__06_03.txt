9.0

The LLM ANSWER accurately identifies both sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, lists them in correct order, and clearly specifies the tasks involved in each parallel split. The answer uses consistent terminology (“concurrently”, “branches”, mentions “Parallel Split #1/#2”) and provides an explanation for each set.

There are, however, some small deviations from the ground truth answer:
- The LLM answer adds brief explanations (“as they are on different branches of Parallel Split”) which, while clarifying, breach the instruction “give no information about Processes A or C” by not fully adhering to the minimalism of the ground truth format.
- The answer does not label the sets as “Set 1”, “Set 2” as in the ground truth; instead, it uses a numbered list, which is functionally equivalent but not identical in form.

These are minor formatting and strictness deviations, but conceptually the content is entirely correct. Given the instruction for "utmost strictness" and that even small errors should reflect in significant point loss, one full point is deducted. Thus: **9.0**
