The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets in the exact order they appear in Process B, with no extraneous information about Processes A or C, fully aligning with the prompt's core requirements. The tasks in each set match the ground truth precisely. However, under utmost strictness, points are deducted for several differences: (1) inclusion of an unnecessary header/title not present in the ground truth (minor formatting addition, -0.5); (2) use of comma-separated lists without the ground truth's bolded "Set X" labeling, code-like backticks, or â€– parallel symbol (-1.0 for stylistic and symbolic mismatch); (3) addition of explanatory sentences about branches and splits, which go beyond the prompt's instruction to simply "list each set" and are absent in the ground truth (-0.5 for extra verbosity). The ground truth's closing statement ("No other tasks...") is omitted, but this is not required by the prompt, so no further deduction. Overall, the answer is substantively accurate but deviates in presentation, warranting a high but not perfect score.
