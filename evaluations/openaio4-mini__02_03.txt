- Q1: Matches ground truth closely, minor extra word ("distinct") but lists cases correctlyâ€”no deduction.  
- Q2: Correct activity identified, but exceeds conciseness by using a full sentence instead of just the name; significant deduction for format deviation under strict evaluation.  
- Q3: Correct activity, but adds explanatory phrase ("appears exactly once") not in ground truth; deduction for lack of minimalism.
