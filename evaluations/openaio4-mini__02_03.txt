9.5

- The LLM answer is almost completely correct:  
  - "3 distinct cases (C123, C456, C789)" is correct, although it could have matched the ground truth wording ("3 cases (C123, C456, C789)").  
  - The answer to question 2 is correct and also includes the correct case reference.  
  - For question 3, "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once (correct).
- The only (minor) deviation is the use of quotation marks around activity names (e.g., “Pack_Items”, "Cancel_Order") and slightly more verbose phrasing rather than the ground truth's concise format.
- No factual errors; formatting/style is the only difference.

Because of the instruction to be "utmost strict" and penalize also small errors:  
-0.5 for inconsistent use of quotation marks and not following the exact concise structure as the ground truth.

Final score: **9.5**
