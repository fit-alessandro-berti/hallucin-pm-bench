9.2

**Rationale (strict evaluation):**

- **Q1 (weight ~15%)**: Exact match ("1"). +10.
- **Q2a (weight ~20%)**: Exact match (2.08%, calculation shown). Minor formatting nit (no space before % vs. ground truth "2.08 %"): -0.1. +9.9.
- **Q2b (weight ~20%)**: Exact match (8.33%, calculation shown). Same minor formatting: -0.1. +9.9.
- **Q3 (weight ~45%, open but criteria-bound, ≤100 words)**: 98 words ✓. Meets (i) single-occurrence ✓, (iii) over-generalisation caution ✓. Partial (ii) variance/instability: notes "skew results"/"overly sensitive" (implies but vague/weak vs. ground truth's precise "single observation... skew averages... collapse to 0%... wide confidence intervals"; lacks process-mining specifics like cycle time/transition prob/resource load/noise). Generic ML tilt vs. process-mining depth; repeats facts unnecessarily. Significant wording/process differences: +7.5 total.
- **Overall structure/adherence**: Clear numbering, data-only, bolding matches. No invention. Minor deductions for Q3 gaps/formatting.

**Composite**: (10*0.15 + 9.9*0.2 + 9.9*0.2 + 7.5*0.45) ≈ 9.2. Strict per instructions.
