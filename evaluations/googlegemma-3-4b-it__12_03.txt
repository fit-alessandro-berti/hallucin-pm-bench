The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate (No) and provides a case-by-case justification citing all relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences, accurately showing violations in C002 (Pack_Items intervenes) and C004 (Check_Fraud intervenes) while implicitly confirming compliance in C001 and C003 via the sequences. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core logic and evidence. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's explicit tabular structure, per-case "immediate successor" verdict, and quantified summary (e.g., "two out of four cases"), which add precision but are not strictly required by the taskâ€”still, under utmost strictness, this stylistic/organizational difference reflects a small shortfall in exhaustive matching.
