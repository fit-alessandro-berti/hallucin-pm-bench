The LLM answer correctly gives "No" as the answer and accurately identifies the relevant cases and their sequences. It notes, with explicit reference to cases C002 and C004, that there are activities occurring between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment". 

**Points lost:**
- It does not explicitly state in a structured way which cases violate and which comply with the "immediately after" condition (only giving sequences, not a clear per-case checklist or summary as in the ground truth).
- It does not clarify that in cases C001 and C003, "Validate_Payment" does immediately follow "Receive_Order"â€”it simply lists the event sequences.
- The answer could have been stricter in pinpointing that exactly two of four cases violate the immediate succession, which is key to why "always" is incorrect.

**Conclusion:**  
The LLM answer is accurate and clear, but less meticulous and explicit than the ground truth about the breakdown of which cases meet or violate the fact. This lack of structured justification and per-case analysis costs it 2 full points.
