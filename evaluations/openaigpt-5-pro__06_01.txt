The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and formats them one per line in the specified structure. This matches the ground truth content and intent precisely. The minor deduction reflects the slight misalignment in spacing on the second line (ground truth uses extra spaces for visual alignment, while the LLM uses consistent standard spacing), which counts as a small formatting error under strict evaluation.
