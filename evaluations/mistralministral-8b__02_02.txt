The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content for all three questions (Q1: 3 cases; Q2: exact sequence; Q3: exact distinct activities, alphabetically ordered). No missing, extra, or fabricated elements in the core responsesâ€”only minor differences in formatting (e.g., headers, explanatory text, code blocks vs. bullet points) and added correct elaboration (e.g., listing cases for Q1 and step-by-step reasoning for Q3), which are not errors but introduce slight verbosity beyond the concise ground truth. Under utmost strictness, this deducts a small amount for non-essential additions, but the high fidelity warrants a near-perfect score.
