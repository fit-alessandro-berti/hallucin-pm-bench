The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, correctly identifying that the statement is inaccurate, citing all 4 cases, and specifying for C002 and C004 what intervenes between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment". The justification is clear and references the relevant activity sequences for each case.

However, the answer does not present the analysis in a tabular or fully systematic format as in the ground truth, and does not make explicit mention of how many cases violate the rule out of the total cases (e.g., "two out of four cases violate"), which would illuminate the degree of violation. Also, while the LLM indicates that only C001 and C003 satisfy the condition, it does not explicitly use the "Immediate successor?" terminology as presented in the ground truth.

Given these minor omissions in explicitness and structure, a one-point deduction is appropriate.
