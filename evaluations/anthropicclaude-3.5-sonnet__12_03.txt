The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise, case-by-case justification that mirrors the ground truth in content, sequence details, and conclusion. The only minor difference is formatting (textual list vs. table), but this does not impact accuracy or adherence to the task requirements, as the justification fully cites relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences without any errors or omissions.
