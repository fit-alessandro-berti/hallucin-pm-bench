3.0

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria emphasizing minimal differences, no extras, and verbatim adherence. Key issues include:

- **Extra elements**: Includes a hallucinated task ("checks warranty eligibility") not present in the ground truth, despite being mentioned in the prompt—this adds an unmodeled activity relative to the reference. Also adds an entire <bpmndi:BPMNDiagram> section with shapes and edges (over 50 lines of unrequired diagrammatic information), bloating the XML beyond the minimal self-contained process definition.
  
- **Invalid XML**: Uses <conditionExpression xsi:type="tFormalExpression"> without defining xmlns:xsi, making the document malformed and non-parsable as valid BPMN 2.0.

- **Non-verbatim task names**: Changes verb forms from prompt text (e.g., "validates the claim" → "validate the claim"; "requests missing information" → "request missing information"; similarly for the extra "checks" task), violating the "match the text verbatim" rule. Capitalization inconsistencies (e.g., lowercase starts vs. ground truth's capitals).

- **Structural and naming differences**: Different IDs (e.g., process id "wrc_WarrantyReplacement" vs. "wrc_process"), event names (start: "Claim Submitted" vs. "Online warranty claim submitted"; ends: "Claim Rejected"/"Claim Completed" vs. "Rejected"/"Successful end"), gateway names (e.g., "Claim Complete?" vs. "Claim complete?"), and flow modeling (conditionExpressions vs. named flows with "Yes"/"No"). Uses <userTask> instead of <task>.

- **Semantic mismatch**: Explicitly models the warranty check as a separate task before the gateway (accurate to prompt but extra vs. ground truth, which implies it in the gateway without a task, creating a flow difference).

These accumulate to major deviations (omissions of exact structure, additions of content, and syntactic errors), with even small naming/verb changes deducting points per strictness rules. Semantically, the core flow is mostly preserved, but extras and invalidity prevent higher scoring.
