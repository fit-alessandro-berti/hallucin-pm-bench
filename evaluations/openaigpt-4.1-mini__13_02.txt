**9.5**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect:

- Q1: Correct (1 occurrence).
- Q2a: Correct (2.08% for events).
- Q2b: Correct (8.33% for cases).
- Q3: The explanation covers all required points—mentions single-occurrence, potential overestimation, skewed analytics, and the need for caution. Language is slightly more general and less technically precise than the sample ground truth: “skewing conclusions about fraud detection” is not as explicit as “resting on a single observation,” and it could state the instability/variance issue a bit more clearly. It does note that results are unreliable due to low support.

Given the rubric's emphasis on "utmost strictness," this minor imprecision in Q3's technical phrasing justifies a small point deduction.

**Final score: 9.5**
