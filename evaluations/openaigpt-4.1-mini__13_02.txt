The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on questions 1, 2a, and 2b (exact numerics, calculations, and formatting minor variances like spacing are negligible under strict evaluation). For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (85 words), explicitly mentions the single occurrence ("only 1 event in 12 cases"), notes variance/instability risks (e.g., "overestimating its role," "skewing conclusions," "without more data"), and cautions against over-generalization ("risks overestimating," "inaccurately treat it," "avoid misleading insights"), aligning with all required criteria without invention or deviation from the log.
