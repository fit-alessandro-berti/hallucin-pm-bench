The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" and provides the essential shortest firing sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) to demonstrate T5 firing without T3 having occurred earlier, matching the core of the ground truth (which also highlights this at step 4 with "← T5 fired before T3"). Markings and shortcut explanation align closely. Minor differences: shorter/more concise sequence and explanation (omits unnecessary extension to T6/T3 and detailed minimality proof for full path); ambiguous phrasing "cannot" (contextually current state, not absolute error). High similarity under strict criteria, small deductions for brevity and non-identical detail/structure.
