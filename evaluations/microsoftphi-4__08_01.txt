The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3, provides an accurate firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3) with precise markings that match the ground truth up to that point, and offers a brief justification via enabling conditions and step-by-step analysis. It avoids the ground truth's error of including an impossible T4 firing in the sequence (as p3=0 after T5, preventing T4). Minor deductions for less emphasis on the inhibitor arc's permanent disabling effect (ground truth's deeper insight that T5 "must" precede T3) and slightly more verbose presentation, but these are small differences with no factual errors.
