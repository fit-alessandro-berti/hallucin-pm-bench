7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence, specifically in case 1002). No errors. Full points here.
- **Question 2**: Strong on core ideas (small sample size, potential bias from snippet, naming variations affecting estimates). Word count compliant (~95 words). However, strict deduction for mild speculation violating "no speculation" rule: introduces un-evidenced concepts like "channels, risk profiles, times of day," "other subprocesses," and implies "Manual Review" hides manual fraud checks (not supported by data; it's a distinct activity). Ground truth is more precise on statistical impacts (e.g., frequency swings, confidence intervals, rare event error) without extras. These deviations reduce fidelity, warranting ~2.5-point loss from a potential 10. Overall alignment is good but not exact.
