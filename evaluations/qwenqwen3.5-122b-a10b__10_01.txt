**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary (mandated terms)**: Perfect match (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance used exactly; no forbidden terms). +2.0 points baseline.
- **Structure & Content Basics**: Activities and roles match exactly (no extras). Table format similar. One R-equivalent per row. +1.0 point.
- **RACI Allocations**: Major failures (12+ cell mismatches out of 24):
  | Activity | Mismatches |
  |----------|------------|
  | Receive Application | CO: I vs **C** |
  | **KYC Review** | AM: I vs **A**; FC: I vs **C**; CO: R/A vs **R** (also wrong bolding) |
  | **Order Vetting** | CO: I vs **C** |
  | **Payment Clearance** | AM: I vs **A**; CO: I vs **C**; FC: R/A vs **R** |
  | Record Update | AM: I vs **C**; FC: I vs **C**; IT: R/A vs **R** |
  | Notify Customer | Match |
  - No **C** assignments anywhere (GT has 7 **C** cells). R/A bundling ignores GT separations (e.g., distinct R/A/C). Does not "reflect narrative" per GT/rubric. -6.0 points.
- **Formatting**: Wrong bolding (all activities bolded vs GT's selective on mandated terms/cells); "R/A" vs "**R / A**" or separate. -1.0 point.
- **Unwarranted Content**: Extra header, full legend (defines unused **C**), interpretive notes (violate "no extra" rubric). -1.0 point.
- **Overall**: ~50% cell accuracy, but strict rubric demands near-exact GT match; extras amplify errors. Significant deductions for differences.
