9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth in terms of content, accuracy, and reasoning. It correctly states that the calculation is impossible due to the lack of timestamp/event-row data in Artefact A, and does not guess or extrapolate from Artefact B or outside knowledge. The explanation clearly mentions the necessity of `start_time` and `complete_time` values, referencing the columns and explaining why calculation is not feasible—matching the approach in the ground truth.

However, minor deductions are warranted for slight verbosity and indirectness:  
- The LLM answer is somewhat wordier than needed ("it is impossible to compute... for the activity..." rather than just "Impossible—the necessary data are absent").  
- The mention of "no calculation... is possible from this log data" is slightly repetitive.  
- A more concise, direct style would have been optimal.

These are minor issues, but per your instruction for utmost strictness and "also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," a full score is not merited.

**Overall, 9.0 reflects a strong, accurate, but very slightly over-elaborate answer compared to the crispness of the ground truth.**
