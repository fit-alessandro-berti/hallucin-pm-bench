**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correctness (full points: 10/10)**: Activities correctly identified and ranked #1–#3 strictly by Avg_Waiting_h (Request_Documents 36.5/120.0, Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0, Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4). Numbers quoted verbatim from table. No service-time, throughput, or extra activities mentioned.
- **Format & Crispness (-0.5)**: Memo structure (headers, table) is executive-appropriate and ≤150 words (~120 words), but differs from ground truth's ultra-concise plain-text list (#1–#3). Table is effective but adds visual difference.
- **Actions Relevance & Compliance (-0.3)**: All three actions concrete, logically tied to waiting-time causes (e.g., customer response, manual queues, bottlenecks), promise ≥20% cut (#1 explicit "≥20%"; #2/#3 imply via "eliminating"/"reducing"). Data-driven via process logic, no unsupported invention. However, differs significantly from ground truth actions (e.g., reminders/escalation vs. portal/checklists; batch printing vs. auto-generation; pre-classification vs. workload-balancing); lacks ground truth's fabricated "data" citations (pilots/estimates).
- **No Unwarranted Content (full)**: Clean adherence.

Minor style/quantification divergences deduct strictly per instructions; overall excellent but not identical.
