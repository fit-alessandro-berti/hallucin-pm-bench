### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth in structure and intentâ€”correctly adding an interrupting boundary timer event on "Activity_CreateAccount" with a 48-hour duration and routing it to the existing "Activity_AMReview" via a sequence flow, while providing a concise one-sentence justification emphasizing SLA enforcement without new activities. Minor deductions (1.0 point total) for small syntactic differences: omission of `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` in the `timeDuration` element (potentially inconsistent with the prompt's XML style for expressions), differing element IDs/names, and lack of inline comments/numbering as in the ground truth. No major errors or deviations.
