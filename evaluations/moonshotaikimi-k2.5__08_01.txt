**9.2**

The LLM answer is correct, concise, and fully addresses the prompt: affirms "Yes" with a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, and provides a brief, accurate justification focused on the inhibitor arc enabling T5 when p4=0 after T2 (while T3 remains unfired). Markings are accurately summarized in shorthand consistent with a safe net.

**Minor differences from ground truth (deducting 0.8 total for strictness):**
- Lacks the ground truth's extra insight that T5 *must* precede T3 for T5 to ever fire (deeper analysis of permanent disablement post-T3; ~0.4 deduction).
- Shorter sequence (stops correctly at T5; ground truth extends invalidly to T4, which cannot fire as p3=0 post-T5, creating p3-p4 imbalance; no deduction to LLM, but highlights divergence ~0.4).
- Briefer formatting (arrow sequence vs. numbered steps with partial markings; functionally equivalent).

No factual errors, hallucinations, or omissions of required elements (sequence + brief justification). Superior to ground truth by avoiding its sequence error.
