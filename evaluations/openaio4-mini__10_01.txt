8.0

The LLM answer is close to the ground truth in multiple respects:

- It uses the required terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"), and does not use any forbidden terms.
- The activities, roles, and structure are accurate and faithful to the prompt and requirements.

However, significant errors appear in RACI assignments, which must cause notable point deductions:

1. **"Receive Application":** LLM assigns both "A, R" to Account Manager, but the ground truth also assigns "C" to Compliance Officer. LLM only gives Compliance Officer "I", which is incorrect.
2. **"KYC Review":** LLM gives "A, R" together to Compliance Officer, but the ground truth has Account Manager as "A" and Compliance Officer only as "R", not "A, R".
3. **"Order Vetting":** LLM puts "C" (Consulted) for Compliance Officer, while ground truth matches. However, it again merges "A, R" for Account Manager, which is borderline correct but doesn't separate as the matrix does.
4. **"Payment Clearance":** LLM assigns "A, R" to Finance Clerk, which is not in the ground truth (should just be "R"). It also misses "C" for Compliance Officer.
5. In multiple activities, "Consulted" and "Accountable" assignments deviate, either by omission or by assigning both "A, R" to the same role indiscriminately.

**Summary of deductions:**
- Each mismatch in RACI (mixing A/R, omitting C, misassigning I vs C, etc.) is a notable error as per prompt strictness.
- But the LLM thoroughly obeys the core vocabulary policy and gets process structure and sequence correct.

For these reasons, a score of **8.0** is assignedâ€”majority of details are correct, with penalty for RACI allocation errors (especially "Consulted" and "Accountable"), but not so severe as to warrant a 7.0 or lower, since there were no structural or terminology violations.
