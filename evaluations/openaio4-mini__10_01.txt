4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Perfect: +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere.
- **Structure and Format (Adequate but not ideal: +1.0 point)**: The response presents a clear RACI breakdown with activities as rows (via bullets) and roles as columns (via sub-bullets), mirroring the prompt's request. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced, aligning with the "unwarranted content" criterion. However, it uses a list format instead of a table, which slightly deviates from the ground truth's tabular presentation, warranting a minor deduction under strictness.
- **RACI Correctness (Poor: +1.0 point)**: This is the core failure, with significant deviations from the ground truth and narrative. Each activity should have exactly one *Responsible* (R) role, with *Accountable* (A) assigned appropriately (often to Account Manager). The LLM introduces errors in 4/6 activities, violating the narrative mappings (e.g., Receive Application handled solely by AM; KYC Review by CO; Order Vetting by AM; etc.). Specific mismatches:
  - **Receive Application**: Compliance Officer listed as I (should be C); minor error (-0.5).
  - **KYC Review**: Account Manager as C (should be A); Compliance Officer as A,R (should be R only); Finance Clerk as I (should be C); multiple errors, no single R clear (-1.5).
  - **Order Vetting**: Matches ground truth exactly; no deduction.
  - **Payment Clearance**: Account Manager as C (should be A); Compliance Officer as I (should be C); Finance Clerk as A,R (should be R only); multiple errors (-1.5).
  - **Record Update**: Account Manager as I (should be C); Finance Clerk as I (should be C); IT Support as A,R (should be R only); multiple errors, dilutes single R (-1.5).
  - **Notify Customer**: Matches ground truth exactly; no deduction.
  - Overall, ~60% of assignments are incorrect or altered, failing the "reflect the narrative" criterion. Small errors (e.g., extra A on R roles) compound to major losses under strict evaluation.
- **Other Criteria**: No self-awareness issues (N/A). No extraneous content.
- **Total**: Strict scoring penalizes all differences heavily; vocabulary saves it from the floor, but RACI flaws dominate.
