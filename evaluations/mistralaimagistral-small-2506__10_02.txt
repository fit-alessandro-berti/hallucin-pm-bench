2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, content, terminology adherence, and RACI assignments, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Structure and Format (major loss: -4 points)**: The LLM uses a non-standard RACI format with R/A/C/I as columns and single roles per cell, leading to ambiguity and incomplete representation (e.g., no cell for multiple roles or blanks). The ground truth uses the standard tasks-as-rows, roles-as-columns format with explicit R/A/C/I letters in cells, plus a legend. This alters clarity and fidelity to typical RACI matrices.

- **Task Descriptions (major loss: -2 points)**: 
  - Fails to use mandated activity terms strictly; e.g., row 3 is "Performs customer check" instead of "**KYC Review**" as in ground truth.
  - Rephrasings introduce inaccuracies: "Receives transfers & logs them" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Releases payment, ensures SWIFT" combines steps and adds unmandated details; "Archives case file & notifies" includes "notifies" not reflected in ground truth's "Archive Record."
  - Omits or alters coverage: Step 5 in description separates "releases the payment" (clerk) and "ensures the SWIFT message" (IT), but LLM combines; ground truth treats as one ("Release Payment") but with distinct assignments.

- **Roles and Mandated Vocabulary (major loss: -2 points)**: 
  - Misuses "KYC Review" as a role (e.g., in columns for steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) instead of an activity, violating the prompt's mandate for "activities and roles." Ground truth correctly uses it only as a task row.
  - Includes "IT Support" appropriately (from source), but introduces no extras like ground truth's unauthorized "Operations Manager."
  - Ground truth adds "Operations Manager" (not in prompt or source), but LLM must match ground truth exactly for scoring—its own role set (TA, RL, KYC Review, IT) differs.

- **RACI Assignments (major loss: -3 points)**: Assignments mismatch across all rows, indicating poor mapping from source:
  - Step 1: LLM (TA-R, KYC-A, RL-I) vs. GT (TA-R, RL-I, Ops-A, IT-C)—wrong accountable and consulted.
  - Step 2: LLM (TA-R, RL-A, KYC-C) vs. GT (TA-R, RL-A, Ops-I, IT-C)—added unneeded consulted; wrong informed.
  - Step 3: LLM (KYC-R, TA-A, RL-I) vs. GT (TA-C, RL-R, Ops-A, IT-I)—reversed roles entirely; treats KYC as role.
  - Step 4: LLM (RL-R/A, KYC-C, TA-I) vs. GT (TA-C, RL-R, Ops-A, IT-I)—wrong responsible/accountable and consulted.
  - Step 5: LLM (TA-R, IT-A, KYC-C) vs. GT (TA-R, RL-I, Ops-A, IT-C)—wrong accountable; no informed.
  - Step 6: LLM (IT-R/A, RL-C, KYC-I) vs. GT (TA-C, RL-I, Ops-A, IT-R)—ignores notification; wrong consulted/informed; adds self-accountable.
  These are not minor variances but systemic errors in interpreting the source (e.g., clerk → TA, compliance → RL, due diligence → KYC).

- **Additional Elements (minor loss: -0.5 points)**: LLM's notes explain mappings but add unrequested details (e.g., "replacing" terms) and justify IT Support incorrectly ("not categorized in theCharge terms"—typo?). Ground truth's notes are concise and focused on adherence. No omissions in covering all source steps, but quality suffers.

The LLM covers the basics (Markdown table, all steps) but fails on strict vocabulary (especially activities), accurate RACI logic, and exact matching, resulting in only partial credit. A perfect match would score 10.0; here, ~20% alignment justifies 2.0.
