3.5

The LLM answer shows effort to use most (but not all) mandated vocabulary and maps most steps, but there are significant issues in strictness, structure, and accuracy:

**Major errors:**
- The LLM omits the "Operations Manager," which is present and essential in the ground truth, acting as the Accountable party for each process step.
- “KYC Review” is incorrectly treated as a role (or sometimes an activity), not strictly as an activity as per the ground truth (where it’s the activity, not the role—a subtle but required difference according to the vocabulary mandate).
- Some tasks conflate multiple distinct sub-steps (e.g. "Releases payment, ensures SWIFT"), which in the ground truth are separated and mapped with proper distinction.
- Some Accountabilities are mismapped (e.g. IT Support is never Accountable in the ground truth, but is twice so in the LLM output).
- Consulted/Informed parties are frequently inaccurate and inconsistent with the ground truth.
- The table legend is omitted.

**Minor—but significant per strictness:**
- The wording for tasks is not always rendered in the mandated format; e.g. ground truth has "**KYC Review**" and "Receive Payment Instruction," whereas LLM sometimes uses unmandated phrasing or incomplete mapping.
- The ground truth lists activities column-first, role-second; LLM does the reverse.

**Summary:**  
The result does use most enforced synonyms and doesn’t revert to forbidden terms, but the format, level of detail, mapping, and inclusion of mandated roles do not follow the ground truth sufficiently. Each small deviation (role omission, incorrect formatting, minor vocabulary slips, accountability mapping errors) justifiably adds up to a significant penalty under strict grading. 

Thus, 3.5/10.
