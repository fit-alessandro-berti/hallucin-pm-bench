6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **R1**: Status match (Compliant), justification equivalent (both confirm sequence for >€10k). Full credit.
- **R2**: Major error - status wrong (Compliant vs Violated), justification incorrect (ignores change-triggered new approval as "last required"; Ship_Goods precedes it by days). Severe deduction (-2.5 pts).
- **R3**: Status and justification match exactly. Full credit.
- **R4**: Status and justification equivalent. Full credit.
- **R5**: Status match (Violated), justification similar but incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice/Receive_Goods as further steps before new approval). Minor deduction (-0.5 pts).
- **R6**: Status and justification match. Full credit.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). Format adheres to prompt (list-style per rule + conclusion).
- **Total**: 6/10 (83% rule statuses correct, but R2 error is critically strict-worthy due to rule interaction misread; minor issues compound loss).
