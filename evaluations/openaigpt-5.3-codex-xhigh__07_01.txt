4.0

### Reasoning:
- **Factual correctness (high marks, but not perfect offset)**: Correctly identifies the two added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), one removed task (`send_rma_label`), and the gateway change (`gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). No extras or misses. (+4 points base)
- **Format deviations (major deductions, per strictness)**:
  - Headings: Plain text vs. **bold** in GT; missing leading **•** as specified in prompt's "exact headings". (-1.0)
  - List style: `-` dashes vs. `*` bullets in GT. (-0.5)
  - Added/Removed tasks: Full XML elements (verbose, with exact spacing from XML) vs. concise "Name (id = `id`)" format. Not matching GT or prompt's "element names exactly" intent (likely ids/names, not full tags). (-1.5)
  - Gateway: Full XML elements with `→` vs. precise "`id` changed from **Type** (v1) to **Type** (v2)". Verbose and structurally different. (-1.0)
  - Missing GT's final note. (-0.5)
  - No "(none)" needed, neutral.
- Overall: Facts perfect (8/10 internally), but presentation mismatches GT heavily across all sections (structure, conciseness, styling), violating "exact headings" and summary style. Strict penalty yields 4.0.
