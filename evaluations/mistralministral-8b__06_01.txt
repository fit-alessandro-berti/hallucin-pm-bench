6.5

The LLM correctly identified both valid pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel, and did not invent any incorrect pairs (no over-generation). However, the format does not meet the requirements outlined in the user’s instructions:

- The output is a bulleted list instead of "one pair per line" using the specified format.
- The use of bold styling does not match the requirement.
- There is a missing alignment for the long task names as shown in the ground truth (although that might be less critical, the strict instructions call for high penalty for even minor deviations).

These formatting errors—especially ignoring the explicit output style—warrant a significant deduction for strictness, despite the semantic correctness.
