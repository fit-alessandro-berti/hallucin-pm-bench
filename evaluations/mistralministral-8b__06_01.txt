The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), with proper alphabetical ordering within pairs and in the overall list, aligning perfectly with the ground truth content and rationale. However, it introduces format deviations that violate the strict output instructions: (1) uses bullet points ("-") instead of plain lines for each pair, (2) applies unnecessary Markdown bolding (** **) to task names, and (3) while spaces around the em dash (" — ") are present and consistent with the specified format, the overall structure does not match the required "one pair per line" without prefixes. Under utmost strictness, these formatting errors—particularly the bullets and bolding—represent small but clear non-compliance, warranting a significant deduction from a perfect score.
