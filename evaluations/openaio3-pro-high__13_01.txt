9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match (1 occurrence). Full points.
- **Question 2**: Exact match, including calculation and rounding (5.56 %). Full points.
- **Question 3**: Accurate content (identifies A1002 as the only case), but phrasing is slightly less precise than the ground truth (omits "only" and fuller explanatory sentence; lists directly without bolding or exact wording). Minor deduction for not mirroring the ideal structure.
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid reasons that align closely with ground truth options (small sample size with variance explanation; temporal bias with time-window focus). Explanations are clear and sampling-related, but minor deviations in wording (e.g., no explicit Â±5.56 pp calculation; "high sampling variance" vs. ground truth's "high variance"; adds "day-of-week or intra-month patterns" which is a reasonable elaboration but not verbatim). Significant but not major deduction for strict adherence to phrasing.

Overall, the response is highly accurate, derives everything from the log without inference, and addresses all questions directly. Minor phrasing/structure differences prevent a perfect 10.0 under utmost strictness.
