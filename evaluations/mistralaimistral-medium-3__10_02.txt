3.0

The LLM answer demonstrates an attempt to follow the vocabulary mandate and covers most core tasks, but there are **serious and multiple errors** compared to the ground truth:

**Major Issues:**
1. **Omission of "Operations Manager":** The ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a fourth role (required for correct accountability according to standard RACI), while the LLM answer ignores this role completely.
2. **Inconsistent RACI Assignments:** The ground truth assigns "A" (Accountable) primarily to "Operations Manager" (as is standard in process controls), but the LLM table misassigns "A" to the "Regulatory Liaison" for "Approve high-risk transaction" and does not use "A" at all for most steps.
3. **Misuse of RACI Columns:** The LLM omits the "Accountable" role for most actions, violating RACI best practices—every row should have exactly one "A".
4. **Scope/Coverage Errors:** The LLM answer adds a task—"Notify Regulatory Liaison of completion"—which is not explicitly in the process description nor in the ground truth. It also leaves out the "Archive Record" step as a documentation requirement (though "archive case file" is present, its role assignment is wrong).
5. **Consulted and Informed roles:** The LLM incorrectly uses/invents RACI assignments compared to the ground truth (e.g. "C" [Consulted] for IT in "Release payment" is missing).
6. **Task Wording Drift:** The LLM answer doesn’t strictly use the task/activity wording from the ground truth and source description—e.g., "Send SWIFT message" (not listed in ground truth table; ground truth abstracts it under "Release Payment" and "Archive Record").

**Minor Issues:**
- LLM answer sometimes uses inconsistent formatting and includes extra notes, which may be helpful but are not consistent with the ground truth's stricter tabular-only structure.

**Positives (justifying not scoring lower):**
- Correctly adheres to the mandated vocabulary in role substitutions ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "KYC Review").
- Captures most major steps (i.e., logging, screening, KYC, high risk approval, release, archiving).

**Conclusion:**  
Due to multiple core mapping, role, and RACI assignment errors (especially the total omission of "Operations Manager"), this answer deserves a *low but not minimal* score per the evaluation policy of strictness and significant penalty for small errors.
