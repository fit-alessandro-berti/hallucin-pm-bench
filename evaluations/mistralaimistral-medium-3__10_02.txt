3.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth)
- **Strengths (limited credit):** The LLM answer correctly adopts the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") throughout, maps most core tasks from the source text without omissions of key steps, and presents a clear Markdown table with a standard RACI key. It covers the informal description's essence (e.g., receiving/logging, screening, KYC, approval, release, archive) and handles IT Support appropriately. This earns partial points for adherence to the prompt's vocabulary mandate and basic structure (+1.5).
  
- **Major Differences and Errors (significant deductions):**
  - **Roles/Columns (-2.0):** Ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a key column with consistent "A" (Accountable) assignments across tasks, implying an oversight or supervisory role not present in the source but integrated into the RACI logic. LLM omits this entirely, reducing to only three roles (plus Notes), leading to incomplete accountability distribution. This is a structural flaw, as RACI requires comprehensive role coverage; empty cells in LLM highlight gaps.
  
  - **Task Coverage and Granularity (-1.5):** LLM splits tasks into 8 entries, adding "Send SWIFT message" (R for IT) and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of completion" (I for Liaison, but no explicit Responsible), which fragments the source text (step 5 and 6). Ground truth consolidates into 6 broader tasks (e.g., no separate SWIFT/notify; "Archive Record" instead of "Archive case file"). This introduces extras not aligned with ground truth's streamlined mapping, and "Notify" lacks a clear executor (e.g., no R assigned), violating RACI completeness.
  
  - **RACI Assignments (-2.0):** Assignments diverge substantially, often simplifying or misaligning responsibility:
    - Receive: LLM (R Analyst only) vs. GT (R Analyst + A Ops Mgr + I Liaison + C IT) – misses multi-role involvement.
    - Screen: LLM (R Analyst only) vs. GT (R Analyst + A Liaison + I Ops + C IT) – ignores Liaison accountability and others.
    - KYC Review: LLM (R Liaison only) vs. GT (R Liaison + A Ops + C Analyst + I IT) – omits consultations/informed parties.
    - Approve: LLM (A Liaison only) vs. GT (R Liaison + A Ops + C Analyst + I IT) – conflates R/A and skips inputs.
    - Release: LLM (R Analyst + C IT) vs. GT (R Analyst + A Ops + I Liaison + C IT) – misses Ops accountability and Liaison notification.
    - Archive: LLM (R IT only) vs. GT (R IT + A Ops + C Analyst + I Liaison) – incomplete on consultations/informed.
    Extra tasks in LLM have no GT equivalents, amplifying misalignment.
  
  - **Formatting and Presentation (-0.5):** LLM adds explanatory "Notes" section and per-task notes (e.g., "Only if flagged"), which ground truth avoids for a cleaner table. Task phrasings vary (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. GT's "Receive Payment Instruction"; no bolding for emphasis as in GT). Ground truth uses "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header and integrates mandates explicitly; LLM's is less precise. Legend placement and wording also differ slightly.

- **Overall Strictness:** With utmost rigor, the core RACI logic (distributing R/A/C/I across roles) is fundamentally mismatched, introducing incompleteness and extras. While vocabulary is flawless, the table fails to replicate ground truth's balanced, multi-role accountability for every task, resulting in a low but not zero score (as it remains functional and prompt-relevant). Total deductions yield 3.5.
