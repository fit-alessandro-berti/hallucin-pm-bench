**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and violates the system instruction by fabricating unsupported durations (e.g., assuming "1 hour" per case, which do not exist in the log). It provides numeric values (4.0 then "corrected" to 1.0) despite the log lacking timestamps or elapsed times, directly contradicting the ground truth's clear statement that the value "cannot be computed." The self-"correction" is inconsistent and still fabricates data, with no recognition of the data absence. This warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
