The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two concurrent task sets in the exact order they appear in Process B, matching the core content of the ground truth without extraneous information about other processes. However, it loses points for minor formatting differences (use of curly braces `{}` instead of the descriptive "‖" notation and lack of bolded headers like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), and omission of the explanatory final sentence ("No other tasks..."), which, while not strictly required by the prompt, constitutes a difference from the ground truth under strict evaluation criteria.
