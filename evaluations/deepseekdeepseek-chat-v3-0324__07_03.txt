8.0

- The LLM answer **uses backticks** for ids and parentheses for names, but does **not include list markers ("-")** as in the ground truth, and **misformats the gateway changes** (does not include the dash or alignment of ids).  
- The content (actual differences) is **fully correct**, but the **formatting** does not exactly match the instructions as demonstrated by the ground truth (verbatim text, dashes before task/gateway entries, and alignment).
- Given the requirement for the output to contain only the three headings and "concrete differences," and to follow the sample closely, this is a significant formatting mistake, resulting in a strict deduction.  
- No content errors, so not lower than 8.0.
