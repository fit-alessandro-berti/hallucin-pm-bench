8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with precise content matching the ground truth (added tasks, removed task, and both gateway changes are exact). However, strict evaluation penalizes formatting differences, including: leading dashes on headings (present in LLM, absent in ground truth); absence of bullet points ("- ") before list items in LLM (indented plain text instead); inclusion of backticks around IDs (matching prompt notation but absent in ground truth); and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry. These small formatting inconsistencies result in a deduction from a perfect score.
