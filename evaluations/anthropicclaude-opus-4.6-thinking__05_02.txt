### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Core Improvement (major weight)**: Perfect match—both identify and apply the exact same change (camunda:dueDate="P5D" → "P2D" on Task_CollectEquipment), complying with rules (no add/delete activities, attribute mod only, single improvement).
- **Diff Format (significant deduction)**: LLM provides a valid single-hunk unified diff with standard @@ line numbers/context (proper for "unified diff"), but adds unneeded file names ("onboarding_process.bpmn"), extra context lines (Flow_4/Flow_5), and @@ -13,7 +13,7 @@ (line numbers not in ground truth, minor inaccuracy assuming XML line count). Ground truth uses non-standard minimal @@/empty @@/no context/no files. -1.0 for format deviations.
- **Output Structure (moderate deduction)**: Extra "## Proposed Improvement", numbered "### 1.", "### 2."; ground truth has "## **Expected answer**", "### Diff (single hunk)", "### Rationale". Unnecessary additions. -0.3.
- **Rationale (moderate deduction)**: One sentence in both. LLM's is detailed/accurate (identifies bottleneck, correct 12→9 day calc based on sum of dueDates=12D original), assumes SLA context implicitly. Ground truth shorter, drops "P" durations ("5 days"), invents unprompted "3-day SLA" (9D still >3D, inconsistent?), adds rule reaffirm ("no new activities"). Semantic match but wording/math/SLA detail differ. -0.5.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: No rule violations, no functional errors, but textual/format diffs → significant loss per instructions. High score reflects effective fix; not 10.0 due to non-identical output.
