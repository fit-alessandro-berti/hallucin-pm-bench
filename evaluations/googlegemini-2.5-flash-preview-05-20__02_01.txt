7.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth on Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, which are all answered correctly. However, for Q5, it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as a never-first event (but it does appear as the first event for case C-77 in the log). This is a significant error since Q5 requires precise event-log reading, and the answer produces a false positive. Given the instruction for utmost strictness and significant loss of points for even small errors, this single but important mistake justifies a 3-point deduction. All other parts are correct, so 7.0 is warranted.
