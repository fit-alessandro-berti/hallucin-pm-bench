**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Decision Points (major partial match, -2.5 points)**: 
  - Correctly identifies and describes the first two decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with exact terminology, conditions, and flow matching GT and prompt.
  - **Key error**: Lists only **2** (explicitly stating "**two** explicit decision points (gates)"), omitting **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a separate third decision point (GT lists it explicitly with vote details). This is a significant content omission/mischaracterization, as MBA is a clear decision (approve/reject vote). Tables add clarity but alter structure from GT's simple numbered list.
- **Required Documents (near-perfect, -0.5 points)**: 
  - Complete list of all 6, using exact prompt terminology (e.g., "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template", "≤ 3 months old").
  - Minor phrasing diffs vs. GT (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; includes "single" and "template" which GT abbreviates/omits) – small but penalized per strictness.
- **Other (neutral to minor deductions, -0.0)**: Extra header, tables, and "Key reminders" section are accurate/helpful but introduce unrequested content/structure vs. GT's concise format. No introduction of forbidden terminology.
- **Overall**: Strong fidelity (~85% match), but decision point count/omission is a core factual/structural error warranting significant deduction. No criminal/low-quality issues.
