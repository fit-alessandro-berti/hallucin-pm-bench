The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, matching the ground truth in core content and sequence without extraneous information. Minor deductions for lacking the descriptive labels (e.g., "Set 1 – first parallel block"), the parallelism symbol (‖ vs. "and"), code-style formatting (backticks), bolding, and the confirmatory sentence about no other parallel tasks, which slightly reduce precision and completeness under strict evaluation.
