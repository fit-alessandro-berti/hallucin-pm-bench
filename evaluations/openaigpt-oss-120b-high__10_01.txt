6.0

The LLM answer gets significant aspects correct, but there are notable deviations from the ground truth that warrant a substantial reduction in score:

**Vocabulary / Terminology Compliance**  
All required terminology is strictly followed. "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" appear (with correct spelling/capitalisation). The forbidden terms are absent. This is an important and positive element.

**Structure**  
The answer produces a RACI matrix with the correct activities (using the new vocabulary), and the roles are accurately transcribed.

**RACI Assignment Errors**  
There are several errors in the RACI designations compared to the ground truth:

- The answer never assigns C (Consulted) to any roles, instead using I (Informed) for all non-handlers. The ground truth carefully allocates C and I, reflecting a more nuanced understanding of stakeholder engagement.
- For almost every activity, the ground truth uses both R and A primarily for the central role but adds C or I to reflect others' engagement, whereas the LLM answer often puts R/A for only one, and I for the rest.
- "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" lack the correct fine-grained distinctions between R, A, C, and I assignments. For example, in "KYC Review", Compliance Officer should be R, but Account Manager should be A, and Finance Clerk should be C, which is not reflected.
- "Receive Application": Compliance Officer should be C (Consulted), not I.
- "Order Vetting": The same issue as above; relevant roles are not properly marked as Consulted.
- "Payment Clearance": Finance Clerk should be R, Account Manager A, Compliance Officer C, but the answer just gives R/A to FC, I to everyone else.
- "Record Update": In the LLM answer, only IT Support is R/A; other roles (especially Account Manager and Finance Clerk) lack the C assignments they should have.
- "Notify Customer": Only Account Manager is assigned R/A, whereas the ground truth specifies more nuanced involvement.

**Key Legend**  
The answer provides a suitable key, but this cannot make up for gaps in RACI allocation.

**Summary**  
- Terminology is flawless (no deduction).
- All process steps and roles present (no deduction).
- RACI allocation is systematically oversimplified relative to the ground truth (major deduction).
- Fails to distinguish between Consulted and Informed, resulting in miscommunication of process responsibilities (major deduction).

**Final Justification**  
The answer is much closer to correct than notâ€”but the repeated, serious RACI allocation errors (missing C and A where needed, R/A assigned too liberally) demand a firm downgrade. Given the rubric of "even small errors should reflect in significant loss" and that RACI allocations are the matrix's primary purpose, I assess this as a strong 6.0. It is correct in format and terminology, but substantively off in its role mapping.
