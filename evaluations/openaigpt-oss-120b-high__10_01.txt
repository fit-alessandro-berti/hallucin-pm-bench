### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Policy Adherence (Strict Requirement)**: Fully correct. The LLM answer uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization and no forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). No points deducted here (+10 equivalency baseline).
- **RACI Matrix Structure and Content**: 
  - Activities and roles match the required list (no extras or omissions).
  - Table format is appropriate and close (rows as activities, columns as roles).
  - However, **major deductions** for RACI assignments, which are the core deliverable and must "reflect the narrative" per the ground truth rubric. The LLM answer simplifies to a binary model (one role R/A, others I) and ignores nuanced distinctions:
    - **Receive Application**: Compliance Officer is "I" (LLM) vs. "C" (ground truth). Error in consultation.
    - **KYC Review**: Account Manager "I" vs. "A"; Compliance Officer "R/A" vs. "R"; Finance Clerk "I" vs. "C". Misses separate accountability and consultation; combines R/A incorrectly.
    - **Order Vetting**: Compliance Officer "I" vs. "C". Error in consultation.
    - **Payment Clearance**: Account Manager "I" vs. "A"; Compliance Officer "I" vs. "C"; Finance Clerk "R/A" vs. "R". Misses separate accountability and consultation; combines R/A incorrectly.
    - **Record Update**: Account Manager "I" vs. "C"; Finance Clerk "I" vs. "C"; IT Support "R/A" vs. "R". Misses consultations; combines R/A incorrectly. (Compliance Officer matches "I".)
    - **Notify Customer**: Exact match.
  - Result: 5/6 rows have errors (multiple cells per row). Each activity should have exactly one "R" (satisfied), but "Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate" is violated for KYC Review and Payment Clearance (no A on AM where specified). Ground truth includes targeted "C" roles for cross-functional input (e.g., Compliance Officer consulted on receiving/vetting), which LLM flattens to "I" universally, contradicting the process narrative's interdependencies.
- **Unwarranted Content**: Minor additions like the title ("**RACI Matrix – FinCo Order‑to‑Cash Workflow**"), RACI key explanation, and footnote ("*Roles not directly handling an activity are marked as Informed.*") introduce explanatory text not in the ground truth. This violates "no extra... content" in the rubric, implying a clean matrix output. Bolding is inconsistent (LLM bold-emphasizes R/A cells; ground truth bolds specific terms like "**KYC Review**" and R/A phrases variably). Deduction for bloating the response.
- **Overall Strictness**: With 80%+ of RACI cells differing from ground truth (24 cells total; ~10-12 mismatches, plus structural simplifications), this fails core correctness. Small errors (e.g., single "I" vs. "C") compound into systemic inaccuracies, warranting severe penalty. Baseline 10.0 deducts 7.5 for RACI failures alone.
