The LLM answer contains the correct pairs and lists them in alphabetical order within each pair, as well as overall. However, it displays a minor formatting issue: it uses single spaces around the "â€”" instead of aligning the items with consistent spacing, as seen in the ground truth answer (which uses aligned columns via spaces). This is a minor but clear deviation from the specified output format, meriting a notable deduction per the instruction for strictness with even small errors. No descriptive rationale was asked for, so that is not a fault. Otherwise, all content (relevant pairs, names, and order) is correct.
