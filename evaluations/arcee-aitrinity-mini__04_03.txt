The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying "No" compliance due to the exact same Rule 3 violation, with precise trace referencing and correct assessments for all rules (including order for Rule 1, VP placement for Rule 2, and CC for Rule 4). Justifications align closely with ground truth reasoning. Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly stating "once each" for QE/RA in Rule 1 (ground truth does); (2) slight phrasing ambiguity in Rule 1 ("in sequence" could imply consecutiveness, though not erroneous given intervening NA); (3) bullet structure vs. ground truth table format. These are small stylistic/content gaps under utmost strictness, warranting a 0.5-point loss from perfect.
