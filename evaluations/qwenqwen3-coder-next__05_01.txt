3.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core idea partially correct (+2.0)**: Correctly identifies boundary timer event (~48h) connected to `Task_Triage` for escalation, no new tasks, references IDs, plain English, <120 words.
- **Major errors (-4.0 total)**: 
  - Wrong placement (`Task_Check` vs ground truth `Task_Receive`): Timer starts later, failing to measure from submission (SLA start); allows >48h total if `Task_Receive` delays.
  - No "interrupting" specifier (-0.5); critical for bypassing.
  - Invalid "aggregate" concept (-1.0): Not feasible in BPMN without subprocess (violates no-new-elements); workaround admits deficiency.
  - No `PT48H` duration or XML (-0.5); ground truth precise.
  - Minor: "leading back" (wrong direction), "SLA gate" mislabels `GW_Docs` (docs, not time), logic flaw ("if `GW_Docs` not reached i.e. `Task_Check` not completed" – contradictory).
- **Net**: Significant semantic/accuracy gaps outweigh similarities; not equivalent solution.
