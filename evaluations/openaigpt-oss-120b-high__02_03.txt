9.8

- The LLM answer is essentially correct and matches the ground truth in all substantive respects.
- Small deduction (-0.2) for not strictly following the explicit "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction: the use of explanatory parentheticals (e.g., listing the case values) and bold formatting is a minute presentation deviation compared to the ultra-concise, markdown-pure bullet style of the ground truth.
- No errors in content.
- Thus, score: **9.8**
