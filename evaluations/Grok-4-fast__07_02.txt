7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: the three added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), the one removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway type change (Exclusive to Inclusive for Gateway_Decision). No incorrect additions or omissions in content, aligning with the prompt's focus on summarizing *all* changes under the exact headings while ignoring cosmetics.

However, under utmost strictness, deduct points for several differences from the ground truth:
- **Formatting inconsistencies (significant deduction, -1.0)**: LLM uses "###" headings and bullet points ("-"), while ground truth uses "* **" bolded headings and numbered lists ("1.", "2.", etc.). This deviates from the structured, key-like presentation in the ground truth.
- **Task presentation style (moderate deduction, -0.5)**: LLM lists ID first followed by name in parentheses (e.g., "Task_VerifyIdentity (Verify Identity)"), whereas ground truth prioritizes bolded name first, then ID in backticks (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"). Order and styling mismatch, treating small presentation errors strictly.
- **Gateway details incompleteness (moderate deduction, -0.5)**: LLM's description is concise ("Exclusive â†’ Inclusive") but omits ground truth's precision, including "(XOR)" and "(OR)" explanations, version references ("in *v1* to ... in *v2*"), and bolding. This makes it less explanatory and deviates from the ground truth's verbose accuracy.
- **Missing closing note (minor deduction, -0.5)**: Ground truth includes a confirmatory statement ("*(No other additions, removals, or gateway-type changes are present.)*"), reinforcing completeness; LLM lacks this, potentially implying less thoroughness.
- **Overall polish**: No extra content or errors, but the response feels less "key-like" and structured than the ground truth.

Content accuracy is strong (90% match), but strict adherence to format, detail, and style pulls the score down from a perfect 10.0. A higher score (e.g., 9.0+) would require near-identical replication.
