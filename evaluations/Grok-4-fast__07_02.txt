The LLM answer essentially mirrors the ground truth answer in both content and structure, with only minor differences in *formatting* (bullet vs. numbered lists, placement of ID/name pairs). There is no change in substance or grouping, and all points are present:

- **Added tasks:** All three new tasks are listed, with both ID and name exactly correct.
- **Removed tasks:** The removed task is listed correctly.
- **Gateway-type changes:** The gateway-type change is described correctly, though not with the extra explanatory notation ("XOR"/"OR") or the explicit note of "in v1" and "in v2". However, the meaning is unambiguous.

The only minor deduction (0.5) is for omitting the explicit clarification of XOR/OR notation and the "in v1"/"in v2" for the gateway (which, while helpful, was not strictly required). Otherwise, the answer is meticulous and complete.
