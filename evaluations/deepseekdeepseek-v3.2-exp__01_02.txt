8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying and summarizing the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with faithful reproduction of key conditions, terminology, and flow from the prompt. It also lists all required documents without omissions or introductions of standard loan terms, adhering to the "exact activity names" rule.

However, under strict evaluation criteria, deduct points for small but notable differences from the ground truth:
- **Decision Points (minor deductions: -1.0 total)**: 
  - Adds unnecessary step numbers (e.g., "(Step 5)"), which are not in the ground truth or prompt's core flow.
  - Lacks precise positional context (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
  - Phrasing variances: Uses "differ by more" instead of concise "else ⇒ escalate"; adds "the loan" in auto-approval; italicizes "*approve* or *reject*" instead of bolding "**Approve** or **Reject**" and omits "(MBA)" abbreviation; introductory phrases like "A decision is made based on..." inflate verbosity without matching ground truth's brevity.
- **Required Documents (minor deductions: -0.5 total)**: 
  - Slight rephrasing: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (adds "single"); " (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (adds "template").
  - Uses bullets instead of numbering, and omits the ground truth's emphatic note on exclusions (e.g., "No credit bureau report..."), which reinforces the non-standard process but isn't strictly required by the prompt.
  
These are small errors, but per instructions, they warrant significant point loss from a perfect 10.0. The response remains helpful, structured, and on-topic without hallucinations or deviations.
