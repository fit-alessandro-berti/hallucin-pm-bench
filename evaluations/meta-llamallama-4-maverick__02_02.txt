All three questions in the LLM answer are correct and match the ground truth exactly, both in factual content and in the requested format:

- Q1: "3 distinct cases" matches the ground truth ("3").
- Q2: The sequence for C002 is correctly extracted and formatted as "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order", matching the ground truth precisely.
- Q3: The immediately preceding activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock"), listed one per line in alphabetical order, match the ground truth both in content and strictly in ordering/formatting.

No over-explanation or hallucinated facts are included, and all small details (ordering, activity names, and formatting) are correct. Therefore, the answer deserves a perfect score.
