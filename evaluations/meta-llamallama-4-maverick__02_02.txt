The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content for all three questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the precise sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities in alphabetical order ("Arrange_Delivery" followed by "Check_Stock"). No extras, omissions, fabrications, or errors are present, despite minor formatting differences (e.g., numbering vs. bullets), which do not impact factual precision.
