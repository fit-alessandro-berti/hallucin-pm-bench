### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match (3 distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). No deduction.
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in A-9321). No deduction.
- **Q3**: Exact match (earliest timestamp is "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00" for A-9321's Receive_Order). No deduction.
- **Q4**: Exact match ("Quality_Check" occurs twice: once for B-1045, once for C-77). No deduction.
- **Q5**: Significant error. Ground truth lists only activities that never start a case: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]. The LLM answer incorrectly includes "Receive_Order", which does appear as the first event in cases A-9321 and B-1045. This adds an extraneous, factually wrong item, making the list inaccurate (4 items instead of 3, with one invalid). Under strict evaluation, this warrants a major deduction for misinterpreting case starts directly from the log.

Overall: Q1â€“Q4 are flawless (80% of questions perfect), but Q5's clear factual error (violating the "only use facts... from the event-log" rule) results in a substantial penalty, dropping from a potential 10.0 to 7.0. The response adheres to the JSON schema but fails on accuracy for one key question.
