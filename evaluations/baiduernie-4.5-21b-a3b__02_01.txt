The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth; all of Q1-Q4 are correct. The only error is in Q5: the LLM incorrectly includes "Receive_Order" as an activity that never appears as the first event of any case, when in fact it's the first event for both A-9321 and B-1045. This is a notable error, but the answer is otherwise perfect and the rest of Q5 matches the ground truth. Per your guidance, even small errors deduct significant points, so a deduction of 2 points is appropriate here.
