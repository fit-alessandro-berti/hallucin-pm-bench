The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed task, and both gateway type changes) with exact IDs, names, and change descriptions matching the ground truth content. However, formatting deviations are penalized strictly: headings include extraneous leading dashes ("- ADDED TASKS" vs. plain "ADDED TASKS"); list items lack the required leading dashes/bullets used in the ground truth (e.g., plain "Task_FraudCheck..." vs. "- Task_FraudCheck..."); and the gateway entries do not use bullets or align with extra spacing (e.g., no leading "-" and no alignment spaces after the second gateway's colon). These structural inconsistencies, while minor, violate the precise output format implied by the prompt and ground truth, resulting in a deduction.
