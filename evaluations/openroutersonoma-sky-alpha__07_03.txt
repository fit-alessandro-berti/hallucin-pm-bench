The LLM answer accurately lists all the functional changes, but it does not strictly follow the required **output structure and format** as specified. The following issues result in point deductions:

1. **Formatting of Headings**:  
   - The LLM answer begins all headings with a dash and space (`- ADDED TASKS`) instead of presenting the headings verbatim and without additional characters (should be `ADDED TASKS` as in the ground truth).

2. **Task Items Formatting**:  
   - The LLM answer omits dashes before each task entry. The ground truth uses a dash and space (`- Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)`), but the LLM answer lists them without dashes.  

3. **Gateway Change Formatting**:  
   - The LLM answer omits the dashes before each gateway change that are present in the ground truth (`- Gateway_ReviewNeeded: ...`), and in one case does not align the colon or spacing as in the ground truth.

4. **Heading and Item Alignment**:
   - Ground truth uses consistent indentation and spacing; the LLM answer has inconsistent blank lines (sometimes none, sometimes one before the first task).

5. **Order and Indentation**:  
   - While the content order is correct, the lack of list dashes and incorrect heading format are significant.

**Summary**: The content and grouping are correct and complete, but the answer loses significant points for not following required output format and for not matching the prescribed structure exactly.
