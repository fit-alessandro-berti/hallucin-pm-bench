The LLM answer correctly identifies the core issue (lack of data in Artefact A, preventing computation of metrics) and explains it in a single short paragraph without guessing, aligning with task requirements. However, it deducts points for minor inaccuracies: incorrectly states "first five rows with only headers" (prompt specifies "first 5 lines, header only" with all rows redacted), unnecessarily references "cost data" (irrelevant to cycle time calculation from timestamps), and uses slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "full dataset is not available, only the first five rows" vs. ground truth's explicit "all event rows and every timestamp redacted" and focus on "concrete times for any 'Approve Invoice' execution"). These small errors, per strict evaluation criteria, warrant a significant deduction from a perfect score.
