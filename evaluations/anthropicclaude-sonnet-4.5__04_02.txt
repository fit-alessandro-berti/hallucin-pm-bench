### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall result (NON-COMPLIANT) and matches the ground truth on R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 statuses. Justifications for R3, R4, and R6 are accurate and concise (â‰¤20 words). However, major deductions apply for:

- **R1**: Incorrect status (Violated vs. Compliant) due to erroneous assumption that Change_Request invalidates initial approvals; R1 only requires initial sequence for high-value POs, which occurred. This is a critical factual error, warranting severe penalty under strict criteria.
- **R2**: Status correct (Violated), but justification focuses on missing Finance_Approval post-Event 8, omitting the key timing issue (Ship_Goods before final approval after change, exceeding 2-day window). Incomplete analysis.
- **R5**: Status correct, but justification omits Pay_Invoice as a pre-new-approval step (ground truth includes it), making it partially incomplete.
- **Format**: Adds unnecessary headings and structure (e.g., "# Compliance Audit"), deviating from the prompt's simple per-rule format, though core elements are present. Word limits are mostly met, but errors overshadow this.

With one fully wrong rule status and incomplete justifications on two others, the score reflects substantial inaccuracies despite partial alignment.
