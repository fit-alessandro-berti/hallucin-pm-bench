1. Correct (1).
2. Acceptable: 5.56. Strictly, per the ground truth, it should be "5.56 %" or "5.56%". Lack of percentage sign, but numeric value is correct.
3. Correct: A1002.
4. Both points are well stated and valid: (1) single day only/does not account for variations, (2) small sample size. Both are clear, close paraphrases of the ideal coverages.

Main deduction: Missing percentage sign on answer 2, and answer 2 could more precisely say "5.56 %" or equivalent formatting. There are no hallucinations, and every answer is fully derivable from the logs. However, per "even small errors," this formatting detail causes a full point deduction.

Score: 9.0
