9.0

The LLM answer matches perfectly on all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable), overall result (NON-COMPLIANT), and format (list style aligns with prompt; bolding correct; justifications ≤20 words). Semantic accuracy is high across all rules.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for small justification differences under utmost strictness:
- R1: Extraneous details (amount/dates) not in ground truth (-0.2).
- R2: Focuses on pre-approval timing/order vs. ground truth's explicit "> 2 days" post-final-approval phrasing (-0.3).
- R5: Omits "Pay_Invoice" (ground truth cites Ship_Goods *and* Pay_Invoice as pre-approval violations) (-0.5).
- Trivial: Date formats (3/05 vs. 05-Mar), phrasing (e.g., R4/R6 synonyms).

No factual errors; violations correctly identified.
