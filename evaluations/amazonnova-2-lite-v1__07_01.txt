The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes: the two added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), the one removed task (`send_rma_label`), and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` (exclusive to inclusive). No extra or missing items, adhering to only the specified categories. However, strict evaluation reveals notable differences from the ground truth:

- **Headings**: Uses `###` markdown headers instead of `**bold**` (significant format mismatch).
- **Task listings**: Reports only `id` values (e.g., `- `check_vip``) versus descriptive `name` primary with `(id = ``id``)` format (e.g., `* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)`). This omits the full descriptive element names from the XML `name` attributes, reducing completeness.
- **List style**: Uses `-` bullets vs `*` bullets.
- **Gateway description**: Concise but lacks `(v1)` / `(v2)` qualifiers and bolding on types.
- No final note "(No other differences should be reported.)".

Facts are perfect (no speculation/errors), but presentation/format and detail level differ substantially from ground truth text, warranting deduction under utmost strictness (2.0 points off for multiple small-to-medium mismatches).
