### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
**Part a) – Major errors (worth ~50% deduction):**
- LLM incorrectly identifies **3 decision points** instead of **2** as in ground truth. The "Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome" is *not* a decision point/gate/conditional branch; it is merely an input step producing a rating. The actual conditional branch is the risk-based skip (GT #1). This adds a fabricated/non-decision point, violating "every *decision point*".
- LLM's #2 correctly captures the skip rule but lacks GT's "otherwise proceeds" clause and precise phrasing/structure (e.g., no bolded title like "Risk-based skip").
- LLM's #3 is mostly accurate but uses "any two approvals ... suffice to pass" vs. GT's "at least two ... record 'Approve'" – minor phrasing mismatch, but process says "approvals", not explicitly "Approve"; still, not exact.
- Structure diverges: LLM numbers descriptively without GT's concise, bolded naming convention.

**Part b) – Major errors (worth ~50% deduction):**
- Misses **Signed Offer Sheet 77** entirely (GT #7, first appears step 8). LLM acknowledges Offer Sheet 77 in step 8 via parenthetical but fails to list the *distinct* "Signed" version as a separate required document, resulting in only **8 items** vs. GT's **9**.
- Order incorrect after step 7: LLM jumps to ID Matrix Declaration (#7) without Signed Offer Sheet 77, disrupting sequence.
- Minor positives: Correctly lists first 5 (Form 14B + 3 Scorecards + Deck Memo) and includes Offer Sheet 77 (#6), ID Matrix (#7 in LLM), Dossier (#8 in LLM). No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML).
- Lists Scorecards as separate (correct, as inputs/documents).

**Overall:** ~40% match in content/accuracy (core rules partially captured, but extra/wrong item in a), missing item + order error in b)). Strict per instructions: significant losses for omissions, additions, incomplete list, and structural mismatches. No perfect alignment.
