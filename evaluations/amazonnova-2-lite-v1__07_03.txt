7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Content completeness (major deduction)**: Missed Gateway_Payment change (exclusive → parallel), a verifiable difference present in v1 (exclusiveGateway) and v2 (parallelGateway). Listed only 1/2 gateway changes. Added/removed tasks correct. (-2.0)
- **Formatting deviations (significant deductions per strictness rule)**:
  - Extra "###" markdown on all headings (not verbatim as required). (-0.5)
  - Unnecessary backticks around all task/gateway IDs (GT and prompt example output plain; instruction's `id` is illustrative only). (-0.5)
  - No alignment/spacing matching GT for gateways (minor but strict). (-0.0, as not explicit)
- **Other**: No commentary added (good). Structure follows headings order. Total deductions from 10.0 yield 7.0.
