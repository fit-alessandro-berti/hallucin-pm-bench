6.5

**Assessment:**

- **Strictness to Terminology**: The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" and does not use the forbidden terms. **No points off here.**
- **RACI Allocation**:
    - *Format*: The LLM uses a bulleted matrix rather than a table. This is acceptable, but less clear than the ground truth.
    - *Keys used*: The LLM uses R, A, C, and defines I but never assigns "I" in the matrix, while the ground truth uses "R/A" for combined responsibility/accountability and explicitly includes "I" where relevant. The LLM's omission of "I" is a notable error (~1.5 points off).
    - *Assignment Issues*:
        - *Receive Application*: LLM assigns R to AM, but only C to all other roles—should have I for FC and IT (per ground truth). Also, A is not clearly marked.
        - *KYC Review*: LLM assigns A to CO, C to all others (AM should be A, CO should be R per ground truth).
        - *Order Vetting*: LLM assigns A to AM, C to all others, missing R/A for AM and I for others.
        - *Payment Clearance*: LLM assigns A to FC, C to others. FC should be R, AM should be A, I for others.
        - *Record Update*: LLM assigns A to IT, C to others—ground truth shows R to IT, I to CO, C to AM and FC.
        - *Notify Customer*: LLM assigns A to AM, C to others—should be R/A to AM, I to others.
    - **Each activity misses correct allocation, especially the separation (and sometimes joint allocation) of R/A, and the inclusion of I** (minus ~2.5 for allocation and another 0.5 for missing dual assignments).
- **No Unwarranted Content**: No extra columns or invented content; this matches instructions.

**Summary**:
- **Good**: Terminology is perfect; right activities and roles; tries to adhere to conventions.
- **Problems**: Assignments for R/A/C/I are oversimplified, and most do not match ground truth; no use of "I"; some roles not accounted for as Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed as per the ground truth.
- **Errors are significant but the majority of terminology and structure is correct.**

**Final Score:** 6.5
