3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Adherence (Partial Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization, and avoids forbidden variants entirely. This aligns perfectly with the vocabulary policy and ground truth, warranting some baseline points.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Deduction)**: The assignments deviate significantly from the ground truth and the underlying process narrative:
  - No combined "R/A" notations where appropriate (e.g., Account Manager should be R/A for Receive Application, Order Vetting, and Notify Customer; LLM omits R or A inconsistently).
  - Inaccurate role mappings across nearly all cells: e.g., KYC Review has Compliance Officer as A (should be R) and Account Manager as C (should be A); Payment Clearance has Finance Clerk as A (should be R) and Account Manager as C (should be A); excessive use of C where ground truth specifies I (e.g., IT Support and Finance Clerk as C instead of I in multiple rows); Record Update has Compliance Officer as C (should be I) and IT as A (should be R).
  - Fails the rubric's correctness criteria: Not all activities have exactly one Responsible role reflected accurately, and Accountable assignments for Account Manager are misplaced or omitted.
  - Total cell-level differences: ~80% of the 24 RACI cells mismatch ground truth, indicating fundamental misinterpretation of the process description.
- **Format and Structure (Minor Deduction)**: Basic table structure is present with correct rows/columns and no extra tasks/roles added. However, bolding is inconsistent (e.g., used for A or R but not combined as in ground truth), and the overall presentation lacks the precise markdown styling of the ground truth.
- **Unwarranted Content (Deduction)**: Includes an extraneous "Key" section and "Definitions" that are not in the ground truth or required by the prompt, violating the rubric's rule against extra content. This adds unnecessary length without value.
- **Overall Strictness**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., C vs. I in isolated cells) cause significant loss, but here the cumulative errors in core RACI logic are severe, dropping the score below 5.0 despite perfect terminology. A score of 3.0 reflects terminology as the sole strong area, with everything else failing to match ground truth.
