The LLM answer is nearly identical in content and reasoning to the ground truth, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps and counts-only data as the barrier to calculating cycle time. Minor deductions for slight phrasing variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "activity counts" vs. "event counts"; "elapsed time... unknown" vs. "start-to-completion intervals... absent"), which introduce negligible but detectable differences under strict evaluation.
