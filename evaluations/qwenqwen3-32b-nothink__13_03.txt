### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Part 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). Full credit.
- **Part 2**: LLM correctly identifies small sample size and potential bias toward rarity but lacks precision (e.g., no quantification of 14 events/3 cases/<2 hours, no statistical explanation of frequency swings like 0% to 7% or wide confidence intervals, no discussion of sampling error for rare events). It ignores key ground truth elements like near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and risks of strict/fuzzy matching distortions. Minor speculation (e.g., "high-risk applications") violates "no speculation" rule, warranting deduction. Response is concise (78 words) but superficial, missing depth for reliable estimationâ€”significant gaps under strict criteria.
