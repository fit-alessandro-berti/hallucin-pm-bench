7.0

**Rationale:**

- The LLM answer correctly identifies all the **required documents** in precise terms, matching the ground truth and not introducing extraneous items.
- The **decision points** listed are correct and named *exactly* as in the process: "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision", and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval".

**Key Deduction Points:**
- **Major deduction:** The LLM answer only provides a list of the names of the decision points, but omits all explanatory context: 
    - It does **not** specify *where* in the process each decision happens.
    - It does **not** state the *criteria or outcomes* associated with each decision point (e.g., the ≤2 score difference criterion for Underwriter Alignment Gate, amount cutoff for Amount Threshold Decision, board vote for MBA).
    - This context is explicitly present in the ground-truth (“branch after the Dual Underwriter Split: If...”, etc.), and is essential for a *strict* summary of the decision points.
- **Minor deduction:** It omits the clarifying note found in the ground-truth about *which* documents are and are not required (although this is not explicitly requested in the prompt).
- **Another minor deduction:** For documents, it repeats the word “template” or uses a slightly different form than ground-truth (“Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” instead of just “Community Impact Statement (CIS)”), but this is extremely minor.

**Summary:**  
This is a *minimally adequate* answer that exactly lists decision point names and documents, but lacks detailed description/criteria/context for each decision, resulting in significant deduction per instructions. If any names were altered or steps omitted, the score would drop further.

**Score: 7.0**
