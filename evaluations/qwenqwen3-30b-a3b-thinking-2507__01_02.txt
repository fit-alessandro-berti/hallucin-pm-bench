4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major shortfall, -4.5 points)**: The prompt explicitly requires *summarizing* the decision points, including their logic, conditions, and flow context (e.g., score differences, escalation paths, thresholds, and outcomes). The LLM answer merely lists the three activity names without any description, conditions (e.g., "≤ 2 points" difference, auto-approval < €15,000, board vote), or positioning in the process (e.g., after Dual Underwriter Split or NFC). This fails to meet the "summarise" requirement, rendering it incomplete and non-responsive to the prompt's intent. Ground truth provides concise but detailed summaries for each, aligning precisely with the process description.
  
- **Required Documents (minor issues, -1.0 point)**: The list is complete and uses exact terminology, matching all six items. However, phrasing deviations reduce precision: "≤ 3 months old" (vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (vs. "pay-stub/tax slip," introducing unneeded "single" and "or" vs. "/"); "(CIS) template" (vs. "(CIS)," adding extraneous "template"). The ground truth's closing note on exclusions is absent but not strictly required by the prompt, so no further deduction. Under strictness, these small inconsistencies warrant a point loss for lack of verbatim fidelity.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts for substantive gaps in summarization (core to the prompt) and minor phrasing errors, resulting in 4.5. The answer is directionally correct but lacks depth and exactness, especially in the primary task of summarization.
