**3.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Line-by-Line Factual Precision):
- **Q1/A1**: Exact match ("3"). **10/10**
- **Q2/A2**: Major hallucination—missing "Receive_Order" (line 2) and "Arrange_Delivery" (line 8); fabricated incomplete sequence ("Check_Stock→Ship_Order" vs. full "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"). No partial credit for order of included events. **0/10**
- **Q3/A3**: Content exact (distinct predecessors: "Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"; alphabetically ordered). Minor format diff (no "-" or "<br>", but lists correctly). **9/10**

**Overall**: (10 + 0 + 9) / 3 = 6.33, reduced to 3.0 for utmost strictness on hallucination/omissions (per instructions; treats missing elements as critical failures).
