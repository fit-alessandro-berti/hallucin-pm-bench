The LLM answer correctly identifies the non-compliance status and accurately cites the two key violations (rules 2 and 3), matching the ground truth on the core reasons for non-compliance. However, under strict evaluation, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it fails to assess or justify all rules (1, 4, and 5, which are satisfied), providing only a partial justification instead of a comprehensive numbered check per rule as in the ground truth. Additionally, there is a small but notable discrepancy in wording for rule 3 ("4 positions later" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"), which introduces minor inconsistency in distance measurement, warranting further deduction despite the correct violation conclusion.
