- Strengths: The LLM's answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks and both gateway type changes. The task IDs and names are all present and accurate.
- Errors:
    1. The output headings deviate slightly from the required verbatim format: the LLM uses a hyphen and space ("- ADDED TASKS") vs. the ground truth's heading formatting (no hyphen, all-caps headings with no decoration or bullet). This is a formatting error—the user prompt states to use the headings "verbatim and in this order".
    2. Task formatting: The LLM uses a " - " bullet before each task line, rather than the ground truth's simple list format (just leading dash). Consistency with ground truth is required.
    3. Gateway formatting: The LLM uses "Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel" (no alignment), while ground truth aligns with whitespace ("Gateway_Payment:    exclusive → parallel"). The LLM does not include the extra spacing, so there's a minor formatting mismatch.
    4. There is unnecessary whitespace at the end of several lines in the LLM response.
- Content accuracy is perfect, but formatting issues (incorrect headings, bullets, missed whitespace alignment) merit a notable deduction under the "utmost strictness" regime.
