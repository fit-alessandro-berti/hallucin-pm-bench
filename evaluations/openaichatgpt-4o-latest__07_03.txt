The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks, the removed task, and both gateway changes, matching the ground truth content exactly. However, it deviates in formatting: (1) unnecessary leading dashes before each heading (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS"), which violates the verbatim requirement for plain headings and alters the structure; (2) lack of alignment spaces in the second gateway entry (ground truth uses spaces after the colon to align "exclusive â†’ parallel" under the first entry). These small but verifiable formatting errors warrant a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
