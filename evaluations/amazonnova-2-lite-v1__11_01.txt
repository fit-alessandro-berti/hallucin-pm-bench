9.2

**Evaluation rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth and prompt):**
- **Correctness (activities/numbers):** Perfect match – top 3 ranked correctly by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1 36.5/120.0, Send_Closure_Letter #2 12.2/44.0, Assess_Liability #3 7.8/16.4). Quotes verbatim from table.
- **No unwarranted content:** Fully compliant – no service-time, throughput, or other activities mentioned.
- **Structure/format:** Crisp memo ≤150 words (~85 words); executive style with title/bolding enhances readability but differs from GT's plain list (minor deduction).
- **Actions:** Concrete, logically tied to waiting-time bottlenecks, explicitly promise ≥20% cut. Avoids inventing unsupported data (e.g., no faux "pilot tests" or estimates like GT). Ideas conceptually align (automation for #1/#2, queue reduction for #3) but phrasing/details differ entirely (significant difference penalty per instructions).
- **Minor errors:** Typo ("letterdispatch"), "95p" vs. GT "p95" (table uses 95p, negligible), markdown extras. Strictness deducts for these + differences despite strong overall fidelity.
