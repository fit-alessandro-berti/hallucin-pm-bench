The LLM answer matches the ground truth on all deterministic numeric parts:

1. Correctly identifies that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time.
2a. Correctly calculates 2.08% of all events.
2b. Correctly calculates 8.33% of all unique cases.

For explanation (3), the answer:
- Emphasizes the low frequency and "rare deviation" status.
- Cautions that generalization could ignore/underrepresent such cases, causing skewed predictions or missed variations.
- Explicitly warns of misinterpreting outliers as noise and missing critical process signals.

All required aspects (single observation, instability, risk of overgeneralization) are present. There are no factual or interpretive errors. Format is correct and direct.

No errors or omissions: perfect score.
