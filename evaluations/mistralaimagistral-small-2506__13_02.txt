The LLM answer is nearly perfect on questions 1 and 2 (exact matches to deterministic ground truth, including calculations and rounding). For question 3, it adheres to the ≤100-word limit (85 words), cautions against over-generalization (skewed predictions, misinterpretation of outliers), implies instability (underrepresentation leading to missed edge cases), and references the rarity, but it does not explicitly mention the "single-occurrence" issue or tie it to specific statistical vulnerabilities like skewed averages or wide confidence intervals from one observation—generalizing to "low-support" instead, which slightly dilutes precision. Minor deduction for not fully aligning with all required elements under strict evaluation.
