- Q1: The answer "3" is correct, though "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" would be slightly clearer or more explicit per the sample.  
- Q2: "Pack_Items" is correct.
- Q3: "Cancel_Order" is correct.

**Deduction reasoning:**  
- The main deduction is for not listing the case names in Q1 as done in the ground truth ("3" instead of "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"). This lacks explicitness and detail compared to the ground truth.  
- The other two answers are fully correct both in substance and wording.

Strict grading per instructions leads to a deduction for the lack of explicit case names in Q1, but the overall substance and reasoning are excellent.
