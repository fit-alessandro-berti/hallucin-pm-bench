10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct and concise, matching the ground truth content precisely for all three questions. Minor formatting variations (e.g., backticks vs. escaped underscore, "3" vs. "3 cases (list)") do not constitute errors, as they align with the prompt's requirement for concise bullet-point answers, and the question for Q1 only asks for the count, not the list.
