### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). However, under strict criteria, it incurs significant deductions for multiple deviations from the prompt and ground truth:

- **Extra content and structure (major error, -3.0 points)**: The prompt requires *only* listing differences grouped under the exact headings, with no speculation or additional analysis. The LLM includes unnecessary introductory text, step-by-step breakdowns (e.g., "Step 1: Identify the elements"), and comparisons, which violate "list **only** the factual differences" and "Do **not** speculate." This adds speculative explanation not present in the XML or required.

- **Incorrect use of element names (major error, -2.0 points)**: The prompt mandates using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML." The XML uses `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status") as the primary element names for tasks. The LLM lists only IDs (e.g., "task id="check_vip"") without the exact names, mismatching the ground truth's format of name + ID (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). This is not exact and omits key readable details from the XML.

- **Formatting inconsistencies (minor but penalized strictly, -1.0 point)**: Headings use plain bullets ("-") instead of asterisks ("*") as in ground truth. Gateway description lacks version specificity ("v1" to "v2") and formatting (e.g., no bolding or backticks). No closing note like "(No other differences should be reported.)" or equivalent "(none)" handling (though not needed here). Sequence flows and other unchanged elements are implicitly handled correctly by omission, but the overall structure doesn't mirror the concise, exact grouping.

These errors make the response less faithful to the XML and prompt, reducing utility as a "meticulous" changelog. A perfect score would strictly adhere to headings-only output with exact names and no extras.
