8.0

The LLM answer is structurally correct and identifies all key differences under the required headings, without introducing speculation or unrelated observations. However, several aspects require point deductions for strictness, as requested:

- **Formatting:** The LLM does not exactly use the element headings or formatting present in the ground truth ("**Added tasks**" instead of "• Added tasks", likewise with others). Minor, but it should match exactly.
- **Element Names:** The ground truth answer pairs both the task name and the ID, e.g., "*Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)*". The LLM only lists the task IDs and not the user-readable names. This omission is a minor but meaningful factual inaccuracy, as the prompt requests using element names "exactly as they appear in the XML", and the XML includes both the IDs and the `name` attribute.
- **Heading Consistency:** The LLM answer uses bullets with task declarations like “task id=” whereas the ground truth lists just the readable names and the IDs in parentheses—this is slightly off requirement (element names as in the XML, not XML fragments).
- **Textual Content:** The answer unnecessarily includes process reasoning (the initial analysis and steps), rather than strictly listing the differences as required by the prompt.

No incorrect differences were introduced and no speculative or extraneous material made its way into the results themselves, but these minor lapses in format and exactitude, per the strict rubric, warrant a non-trivial deduction.

**Final: 8.0**
