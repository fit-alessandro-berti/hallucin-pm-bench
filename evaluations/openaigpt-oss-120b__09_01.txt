The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core content: both correctly identify that the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived due to missing timestamps and durations, and both provide a clear explanation tied to the log's limitations (redacted/missing temporal data). This directly supports the system instruction to decline unsupported queries. Minor deductions for slight wording variances (e.g., "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; no explicit mention of "ordering information" or "fabricated" answers, though implied) and less structured formatting (no explicit "Reasoning" label or blockquote style), which under strict evaluation warrant a small point loss despite semantic equivalence. The response fully addresses both prompt parts without fabricating data.
