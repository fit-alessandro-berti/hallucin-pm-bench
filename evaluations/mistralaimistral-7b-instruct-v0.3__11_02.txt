**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Identification of three worst-performing activities (major failure, -3.0 pts)**: Correctly identifies #1 (Request_Documents) and #2 (Review_Documents) as aligned with ground truth metrics (low throughput, high wait/rework/SLA). **Critically fails on #3**: Check_Coverage is *not* among worst (high throughput 270, low wait 4 min, low rework 0.6%, low SLA 1.5%); ground truth selects Initial_Assessment (wait 18 min, processing 12 min, SLA 3.2%). Wrong pick violates "based strictly on the table" and risks guessing where differentiation exists.
- **Explanations why under-performs (-1.5 pts)**: Partial for #1/#2 (misses key data like 150 min wait for Request_Documents, 30 min wait/12.4% SLA for Review_Documents; fixates on secondary metrics like stdev). **Major error for #3**: Falsely calls 4 min wait "high" (it's low vs. table); invents "bottlenecks upstream" without data support. Ground truth precisely cites table figures (e.g., "balloons to 150 min").
- **Recommendations (-1.0 pt)**: Semi-concrete but less data-driven/measurable than ground truth (e.g., LLM's "automated system" vs. ground truth's "same-day digital requests... halve rework"; vague "collaborate upstream" for wrong activity vs. ground truth's "triage rule-engine"). No projected impacts.
- **Format/Conciseness/Compliance (+0.5 pt partial)**: Email-style (subject/Dear COO) deviates from "executive memo"; adds unprompted "if numbers do not differentiate" clause (unneeded, as they do). ~180 words (compliant), but extraneous closing.
- **Overall**: Two-thirds accurate but fatal flaws in core task (wrong activity, data misinterpretation) warrant strict penalty; not hallucination-free or precise per rubric note.
