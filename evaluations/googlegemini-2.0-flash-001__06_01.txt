9.5

The LLM answer contains both required pairs, with each pair named correctly and in the required alphabetical order both within the pair and in the list as a whole. However, it differs very slightly in formatting from the ground truth (i.e., there are 2 spaces before and after the dash as opposed to 5 in the second pair in the ground truth). This is a minor but tangible deviation in strict grading, so a small fraction of a point must be deducted.

No tasks are omitted, no extraneous pairs are listed, and task names are correct. Thus, the score is 9.5 due to this very minor formatting inconsistency.
