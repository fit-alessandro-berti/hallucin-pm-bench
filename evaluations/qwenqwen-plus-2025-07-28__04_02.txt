6.0

R1: Correct (Compliant, justification accurate).  
R2: **Incorrect** (LLM marks Compliant, but actually Violatedâ€”Ship_Goods before new approval after Change_Request, exceeds 2 days from final approval).  
R3: Correct (Violated, justification accurate).  
R4: Correct (Not Applicable, correct justification).  
R5: Correct (Violated, justification accurate).  
R6: Correct (Compliant, correct justification).  

LLM missed the violation in R2 (major compliance miss), and slightly under-explains R2 (focuses on timing after wrong approval). Justifications are sometimes under 20 words but sometimes lack precision. The overall conclusion (NON-COMPLIANT) is correct, but the error in R2 is severe. According to strictness with even small errors, a major missed violation warrants significant penalty: 6.0.
