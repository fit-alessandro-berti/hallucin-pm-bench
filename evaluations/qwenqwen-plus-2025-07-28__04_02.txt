4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Overall Structure and Format**: Matches the required format (status + ≤20-word justification per rule, all-caps overall result). No deduction here, but does not follow ground truth's table style (minor, as prompt does not mandate it).
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification similar in meaning but less precise (omits "present for amount > €10 000"). Minor wording difference: -0.5 points.
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated). Justification fails to account for new approval after Change_Request as the "last required approval," ignoring rule interaction with R5. Major error in compliance analysis: -4.0 points.
- **R3**: Status correct (Violated). Justification concise but equivalent; dates not specified (unlike ground truth). Minor omission: -0.5 points.
- **R4**: Status correct (Not Applicable). Justification equivalent. No deduction.
- **R5**: Status correct (Violated). Justification captures essence (focus on Ship_Goods before new approval) but omits Pay_Invoice example from ground truth. Partial match: -1.0 point.
- **R6**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification equivalent. No deduction.
- **Overall Result**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). No deduction.

**Rationale for Score**: Strict evaluation penalizes the critical R2 error heavily (wrong status and flawed reasoning on approval timing post-change), plus minor justification inconsistencies. 5/6 rule statuses correct, but one major violation misdetection drops score significantly from a potential 10.0.
