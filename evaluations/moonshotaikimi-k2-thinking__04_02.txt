7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification is nearly identical in meaning and brevity. No deduction.
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated); justification misses the key impact of Change_Request requiring a new approval, treating the initial Finance_Approval as final. This is a major error in interpreting rule dependencies. Significant deduction (-2.0 points).
- **R3**: Status matches (Violated). Justification equivalent. No deduction.
- **R4**: Status matches (Not Applicable). Justification similar and accurate. Minor phrasing difference (e.g., "hazardous = false" vs. "Trace has hazardous = false"), but no impact. No deduction.
- **R5**: Status matches (Violated). Justification partially accurate but incomplete (focuses only on Ship_Goods, omits Pay_Invoice as in ground truth). Small error, but strictness requires deduction (-0.5 points).
- **R6**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification equivalent. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT). Ground truth notes specific violations; LLM implies them correctly via per-rule analysis. No deduction.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deduct for R2 error and minor R5 incompleteness, yielding 7.5. Strictness applied to rule-specific accuracy as core to the task.
