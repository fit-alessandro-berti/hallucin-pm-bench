The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the core requirements and XML differences. However, it deducts points for significant deviations from the ground truth: (1) uses only task IDs without including the full names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status") or explicit "id = `...`" formatting, omitting descriptive details present in the XML and ground truthâ€”major error, as this reduces clarity and fidelity; (2) gateway change phrasing is concise but omits version references ("(v1)" and "(v2)") and full "changed from ... to ..." structure; (3) minor formatting issues (no bold headings, - bullets vs. * , no backticks). No speculation or extraneous content, but strict evaluation penalizes incomplete matching to ground truth by ~3 points total.
