10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct, concise, and matches the prompt's instructions for bullet-point format. It directly addresses each question without errors or extraneous details. The ground truth's additional enumeration of case names in A1 is not required by the prompt, so it does not constitute a difference warranting point loss. Minor formatting variations (e.g., escaped underscores, labeling) are insignificant and do not impact accuracy.
