8.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, but there are several small discrepancies and missed details that warrant point deductions given the requested strictness:

**Positives:**
- The LLM uses the correct terminology for decision points (e.g., “Underwriter Alignment Gate”, “Amount Threshold Decision”, “Final Micro-loan Board Approval”).
- The sequence and logic for each decision point is accurately summarized.
- The required documents match the names and forms as listed.

**Negatives (for point deductions):**
1. The LLM adds “(step 4.5)” and “(step 7)”, annotations not present in the process definition or ground truth, which slightly deviates from the instruction to use “exactly the activity names given”.
2. The summary of each decision point is slightly less precise than ground truth (e.g., “…Board votes approve or reject for amounts ≥ €15 000” could be clearer: “the board votes Approve or Reject”—the ground truth provides the placement within the process more explicitly).
3. The LLM answer misses the explicit placement context (“after Dual Underwriter Split” and “after Neighbourhood Feedback Check”) for each decision point (provided in the ground truth), which may confuse in a process audit context.
4. The “Latest Income Statement” parenthetical (“single pay-stub or tax slip”) is copied, but the ground truth keeps this in tighter form (“pay-stub/tax slip”). Small, but a slight imprecision.
5. The LLM omits (in the required documents list) the clarifying statement in the ground truth answer: “No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.” As strictness is required, this omission is significant.
6. The initial list for required documents is almost verbatim, but “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” may not match “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” if the intent is that a filled-out form is required rather than the template. The ground truth removes the word “template”.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer is accurate and usable, but loses points for missing context placement for decision points, imprecise language, and omitting an explicit list of unrequired documents (a direct signal of difference from standard loans). These collectively justify a strict reduction to 8.0.
