7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in structure, uses exact terminology from the prompt (e.g., activity names like "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision"), and correctly identifies the three main decision points with accurate conditional logic matching the prompt and ground truth. The required documents list is complete and nearly verbatim, with all six items present.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Factual error in step numbering**: Labels "Underwriter Alignment Gate" as "step 4.5", but the prompt explicitly numbers it as step 5 (after steps 4a/4b). This introduces non-existent terminology and deviates from the process flow, warranting a significant deduction (~1.5 points).
- **Wording inconsistencies in documents**:
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" adds "old" not in the prompt's "≤ 3 months old" or ground truth's "≤ 3 months", creating a minor but unnecessary variation.
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" includes "single", which matches the prompt but is omitted in ground truth's abbreviated "(pay-stub/tax slip)", introducing a subtle difference.
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes "template" from the prompt, but ground truth shortens to "(CIS)", so it's faithful to the source but not identical to ground truth.
- **Note at end**: LLM's "(All documents must be submitted at the start.)" is logical but differs from ground truth's "(No credit bureau report...)", which emphasizes exclusions per the prompt's non-standard nature. This changes emphasis without adding value.
- **Minor formatting/structural diffs**: Bolded elements and numbering are clean, but lack ground truth's contextual phrases (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split") and use a separator (---) not present, making it slightly less precise in flow description.

Overall, high fidelity (80%+ match), but the step error and small wording/note variances prevent a top score.
