8.0

The LLM answer provides the correct two pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel and presents them in the appropriate alphabetical order within each pair, and overall.

However, a significant small error is present: the format of the second output pair does not match the specified format, as there is only a single space between "Procure_Materials" and "—", and "—" and "Schedule_Machines", instead of matching the spacing/alignment of the first pair and of the ground truth (which used multiple spaces for column alignment). Since the prompt calls for strict grading and adherence to format, this is a non-trivial deviation.

Therefore, although the substance is correct, this formatting inconsistency is a notable flaw, resulting in a score of 8.0.
