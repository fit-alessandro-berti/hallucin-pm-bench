The LLM answer correctly identifies the need for an interrupting boundary timer event with a 48-hour duration and a new sequence flow to Task_Triage, aligning with the SLA intent and constraints (no new tasks). It stays under 120 words and references relevant IDs. However, attaching the timer to Task_RequestDocs (a late, conditional step) is incorrect and fails to broadly enforce the deadline from submission, unlike the ground truth's placement on Task_Receive. This core mismatch, plus unsubstantiated "starting from submission" (timers tie to activity start) and lack of XML details, results in major deviations, warranting a low score under strict evaluation.
