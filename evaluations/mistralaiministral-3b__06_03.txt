9.0

The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth: it correctly lists and numbers the two sets of tasks that execute concurrently in Process B, and specifies all task names precisely and in the correct order.

The only (extremely minor) differences:
- The LLM uses prose (“the first set... is:”) rather than explicitly labeling them “Set 1” and “Set 2” or specifying which is “the first parallel block”.
- The separator (bullet points instead of the ground truth’s parallel bar notation “‖”) is stylistic rather than substantive.
- The LLM doesn’t explicitly add “No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel,” although it answers the prompt fully and only discusses the parallel sets.

Given utmost strictness and that even small differences count, these stylistic/structural differences cost a full point, but there are no factual or substantive errors.

Final score: 9.0
