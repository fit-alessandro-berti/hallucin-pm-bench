The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides accurate evidence from cases 1001 (reversed order) and 1002 (absence of Update_Inventory, disproving "always"), with precise timestamps and a clear refutation of the claimed sequencing. However, it deducts points for omitting case 1003, which shows another reversed order and includes an additional activity (Quality_Check) not addressed, making the justification less comprehensive than the ground truth despite the verdict being equivalently supported.
