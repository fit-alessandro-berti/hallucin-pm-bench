**9.7**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1**: Minor wording difference ("1 time" vs. "1 occurrence"). Semantically identical, but strict format deviation costs -0.1.
- **Q2**: Exact calculation and rounding (5.56%). Extra explanation (total events, formula) is helpful but not in GT; minor formatting ("% " vs. "%"). Negligible deduction -0.1.
- **Q3**: Precise list ("A1002") matches requirement; GT's extra phrasing ("Only case... contains") is elaborative, not required. Perfect - no deduction.
- **Q4**: First reason exactly matches GT "small sample size" (includes 18 events/4 cases detail). Second aligns closely with "temporal bias" (time variations), but introduces unsubstantiated "holidays" example (minor inference violation per system rules) and broader "daily/weekly" vs. GT's precise "short time window/morning." Strong but not identical -0.1 total.

Overall: Extremely close match (no factual errors, adheres to log-only data), high fidelity. Deductions only for tiny phrasing/format/inference nits under utmost strictness.
