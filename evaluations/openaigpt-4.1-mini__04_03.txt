The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in substance, correctly identifying "No" compliance due to the sole violation of Rule 3 (NA before RA), while affirming satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4 with precise reasoning tied to sequence and requirements. It references all rules explicitly, uses clear indicators (✅/❌), and provides a concise justification. Minor deductions for format differences (numbered list vs. table; added trace details and position numbers not in ground truth, slightly less concise) and subtle wording variations (e.g., "before RA is complete" vs. "before RA is completed; wait until both QE and RA are finished"), but no factual errors or omissions.
