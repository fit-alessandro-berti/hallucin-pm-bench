The LLM answer accurately identifies all changes: 3 added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), 1 removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway type change (exclusive to inclusive). No factual errors, no inclusion of ignored elements (e.g., name changes, flows). However, strict evaluation deducts significantly for multiple small differences vs. ground truth:
- Headings casing ("Added Tasks" vs. "Added tasks"; "Gateway-Type Changes" vs. "Gateway-type changes").
- List style (bullets vs. numbered).
- Item format (ID-first **ID** ("name") vs. name-first **name** (`ID`); quotes vs. backticks).
- Gateway wording ("Exclusive Gateway" to "Inclusive Gateway" vs. "exclusive (XOR) ... to inclusive (OR)" with v1/v2 references).
- Extra title and closing sentence (not "strictly" under headings only).
These formatting/style mismatches prevent a perfect score despite correct content.
