9.2

The LLM answer is substantively correct and closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying the impossibility due to redacted timestamps in Artefact A, explicitly addressing the lack of data for average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% CI, and stating the precise reason without guessing. It matches the "one short paragraph" requirement and uses plain text (minor markdown bolding is negligible). Deductions for: (1) unnecessary elaboration on Artefact B's irrelevance and cycle/lead time distinction (absent in ground truth, adding length and deviation ~0.4 pts); (2) different phrasing/structure (e.g., "I cannot compute..." vs. direct "Impossible —", longer sentences ~0.2 pts); (3) minor rewording like "processing duration" and "mathematically impossible" vs. ground truth's concise "absent"/"cannot be calculated" (~0.2 pts). No factual errors, but strict difference-matching penalizes extras.
