9.0

The LLM answer is correct and concise, giving the accurate response ("No") and citing the relevant CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with their activity sequences, clearly pointing out the presence of intervening activities that contradict the “immediately after” statement. It also notes, for completeness, that the sequence is immediate in C001 and C003 but that this does not satisfy the “always” condition.

Points lost:
- The answer does not explicitly provide a full, systematic per-case breakdown as the ground truth does (with a clear tabular case-by-case list and the explicit mention of "immediate successor?").
- The explicit mention of “two out of four cases violate” (quantitative clarity) in the ground truth is missing.
- While not strictly necessary, referencing the precise phrasing in the fact (“always occurs immediately after”) is a bit less explicit than optimal.

Thus, due to these minor omissions in detail and structure (as required by the standard of utmost strictness), the score is 9.0.
