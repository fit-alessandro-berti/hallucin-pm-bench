The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in correctness, completeness, and key details: it accurately answers "No," correctly identifies all four relevant cases (C001â€“C004), provides the precise intervening activities for counterexamples (C002: Pack_Items; C004: Check_Fraud), notes the immediate cases (C001, C003) for context, and concludes based on the "always" violation by citing the two counterexamples. No factual errors or omissions exist. The minor deduction (-0.5) is for stylistic differences in presentation (bullet-point list vs. tabular format in ground truth), which slightly reduces alignment under strict format scrutiny, though the justification fully meets the task's requirements for citing CaseIDs and sequences.
