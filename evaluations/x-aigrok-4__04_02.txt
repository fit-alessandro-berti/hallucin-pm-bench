7.0

Rationale:
- R1: Correct status and justification.
- R2: Status and reasoning mostly correct ("Ship_Goods occurred before new required Manager_Approval"), but LLM misses the requirement that Ship_Goods must occur within 2 days after the last required approval (which is delayed due to the Change_Request), offering a slightly ambiguous explanation and not explicitly referencing the 2-day violation.
- R3: Fully correct.
- R4: Fully correct.
- R5: Correct status and reasoning, though the justification could be clearer (including mention of Pay_Invoice, as in the ground truth).
- R6: Fully correct.
- Overall result: Correct.

Errors:
- R2: Justification is less precise than ground truth; doesn't emphasize the "within 2 days after approval" aspect—loses points here.
- R5: LLM's explanation references only Ship_Goods, not Pay_Invoice, missing detail from the expected answer.
- Several missed details and slight imprecisions—enough to justify a 3-point deduction (strict grading).

Hence, **7.0**.
