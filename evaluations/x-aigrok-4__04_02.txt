The LLM answer matches the ground truth in status for all rules (R1–R6) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). Format adheres to the prompt (status + ≤20-word justification per rule). However, R2 justification is significantly flawed: it incorrectly attributes violation to approval sequencing (mixing with R5) rather than the 2-day timing after the last required approval post-change (Ship_Goods on 05-Mar vs. new approval on 07-Mar). This core misunderstanding deducts substantial points despite minor variations elsewhere (e.g., R3 lacks dates; R5 omits Pay_Invoice explicitly). Strict evaluation penalizes the erroneous R2 reasoning heavily.
