2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a very low score. Even minor phrasing or structural differences contribute to significant point deductions, as per the instructions. Key differences include:

- **Roles**: The LLM uses only the three source-derived roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), aligning with the prompt's mandate to use *only* mandated terms and source roles. The ground truth erroneously introduces an undocumented "Operations Manager" role, but this creates a mismatch—the LLM's table has 3 columns vs. the ground truth's 4, altering the entire RACI structure.

- **Tasks/Activities**: Major discrepancies in coverage, granularity, and wording:
  - LLM expands to 8 tasks, explicitly covering all source steps (e.g., separate "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" for source step 5's IT role, "Archive case file" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison" for source step 6). Ground truth condenses to 6 tasks, omitting the explicit SWIFT sending (a clear source element), combining archiving and notification into "Archive Record," and rephrasing (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. LLM's accurate "Receive and log transfer instruction"; no "both sender and beneficiary" detail in ground truth). This results in incomplete mapping in ground truth, but the LLM's additions create divergence (e.g., extra numbered tasks and split final step).
  - Wording violations: LLM adheres closely to source phrasing (e.g., "transfer instruction," "payment against the sanctions list") and mandates "**KYC Review**," but ground truth simplifies/ageneralizes (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction," "Screen Against Sanctions List" without "payment," no "if flagged" in approval task). Small omissions like these deduct points heavily.
  - No omissions in LLM, but the extra granularity (e.g., task 8 "Notify") differs from ground truth's consolidation, counting as a structural error.

- **RACI Assignments**: Completely divergent across all rows, with no row matching exactly:
  - LLM combines "R/A" in single cells (non-standard presentation, implying dual roles without separation) and uses only R, A, I, or "–" (no C assignments, despite legend including it). Ground truth uses bolded single letters, consistently applies one R and one A per row, and incorporates C (e.g., IT as C in multiple tasks, reflecting consultation not in source/LLM).
  - Examples of mismatches:
    - Task 1 (Receive): LLM R/A Analyst + I Liaison + – IT vs. ground truth R Analyst + I Liaison + A Operations Manager + C IT.
    - Task 2 (Screen): LLM R/A Analyst + – + – vs. ground truth R Analyst + A Liaison + I Operations Manager + C IT (wrongly assigns A to Liaison, not in source).
    - Task 3 (KYC): LLM I Analyst + R/A Liaison + – vs. ground truth C Analyst + R Liaison + A Operations Manager + I IT (I vs. C for Analyst; extra A and I).
    - Similar full mismatches in tasks 4-5; LLM's tasks 6-8 have no direct ground truth equivalents, leading to uncomparable assignments.
  - This core RACI content differs in ~100% of cells, a fatal flaw under strict evaluation.

- **Formatting and Structure**:
  - LLM's table includes task numbers in cells and a dashed line separator ("-------------------------------------------------"), with intro text ("one interpretation...") and closing notes—unnecessary additions not in ground truth, diluting focus.
  - Ground truth uses a clean header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), bolded mandated terms (e.g., "**KYC Review**"), no numbers, and post-table notes on vocabulary/mapping. LLM's legend is similar but placed before the table; ground truth integrates legend succinctly at end.
  - Both use Markdown correctly, but LLM's combined R/A and dashes vs. ground truth's separated/bolded entries create visual/interpretive differences.

- **Overall Adherence to Prompt**:
  - Both enforce mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions— a minor positive. However, LLM's expansions ensure full source coverage (e.g., SWIFT, notification), while ground truth omits elements, but the evaluation metric prioritizes similarity to ground truth, penalizing all variances.
  - No criminal/jailbreak issues, but irrelevant here.

These cumulative differences (structural, content, assignments) exceed "small errors," justifying a score near the minimum. A 2.0 reflects partial credit for vocabulary and Markdown compliance, but zero for RACI accuracy and task fidelity relative to ground truth.
