5.0

**Justification and Strict Error Analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer correctly uses the enforced vocabulary (**KYC Review**, **Regulatory Liaison**, **Transaction Analyst**) throughout, with no forbidden synonyms.
- Responsibilities are generally assigned using the RACI model, and the answer is formatted in Markdown as instructed.

**Major Issues (with significant point deductions):**

1. **Missing Role:**
   - The role **Operations Manager** is entirely omitted, whereas the ground truth not only includes it, but assigns "Accountable" responsibilities for every step—a very substantial oversight.

2. **Task Organization and Wording:**
   - Several task descriptions do not use the precise, mandated terminology from the prompt/ground truth. For example:
     - "Receive and log transfer instruction" (LLM) vs. "Receive Payment Instruction" (ground truth).
     - "Screen payment against sanctions list" (LLM) vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List" (ground truth).
     - "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" is not exactly aligned with the concise "KYC Review".
     - "Archive case file" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison" both appear, but "Notify" is not a separate step in the ground truth.
     - The inclusion of "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" is not in the ground truth table, and the explicit instruction was to cover tasks in the same way.
   - The LLM table contains **8 tasks**, rather than the **6** in the ground truth (with paired/merged steps as intended by the documented process).

3. **Incorrect RACI Assignments:**
   - Operations Manager (critical as 'A' for all tasks per ground truth) is entirely absent.
   - "Transaction Analyst" listed as both Responsible and Accountable (R/A) for several tasks—even those (like "Screen Against Sanctions List") where the ground truth makes Regulatory Liaison Accountable.
   - Consulted ("C") assignments are omitted entirely, e.g., IT Support is only "R/A" or "I".
   - The LLM answer gives "Regulatory Liaison" both Responsible and Accountable (R/A) for multiple steps, but does not reflect the ground truth distribution, especially the Accountable role.

4. **Extraneous/Invented Steps:**
   - "Notify Regulatory Liaison" (Step 8) has no ground truth corollary, representing a conceptual drift from the process source.

**Consequences:**
- Due to the omission of a core role, significant divergence in task wording, missing/incorrect RACI assignments, and incorrect number/merging/splitting of steps, the answer reflects partial understanding but fails to match the required output fidelity.
- The consistent use of mandated synonyms prevents a lower score (~3), but all other deviations justify significant loss of points.

**Final Score:** **5.0** — halfway between "not matching key requirements" and "acceptable but with material errors."
