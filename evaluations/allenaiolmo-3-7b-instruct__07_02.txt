### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks**: Correctly identifies all 3 added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject). However, lists only IDs without names (ground truth prioritizes names like "**Verify Identity**" with ID in parens), minor format deviation. (9/10)
- **Removed tasks**: Major factual errors—incorrectly lists Task_ApproveLoan as removed (it exists in both versions with same ID, only name changed, which is to be ignored); adds interpretive text "(now split/replaced by new flow)" and "(replaced by Task_FinalReject)" violating "strictly under headings" and introducing false analysis. Misses no items but fabricates one, contradicting ground truth's single removal (only Task_RejectLoan). (0/10)
- **Gateway-type changes**: Correctly notes change from Exclusive to Inclusive for Gateway_Decision. However, adds extraneous explanation "(now supports multiple outgoing flows)" and lacks precise BPMN notation "exclusive (XOR) to inclusive (OR)". (7/10)
- **Overall**: Factual error in "Removed tasks" (core content mismatch) dominates; extra interpretive text across sections violates strict summarization. Formatting differs (bullets vs. numbered, bold styles). Strict deduction for all deviations yields low score.
