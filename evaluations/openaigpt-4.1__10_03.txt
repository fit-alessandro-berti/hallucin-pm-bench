### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, without any disallowed synonyms or leaks from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). It produces a Markdown table format and covers the roles from the roster. The "R/A" notation is a reasonable shorthand for combined Responsible/Accountable, aligning conceptually with the ground truth's "R, A".
- **Major Weaknesses (significant deductions)**: 
  - **Added unauthorized activities**: The prompt strictly forbids adding activities, yet the LLM introduces four extras ("Escalation for approval (>70)", "Payment scheduling (≤70)", "Funds release", "Notification to originating analyst"). The ground truth expands the process into only two additional activities ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds") to cover the narrative without over-adding or inventing steps. This violates the "do not ... add activities" rule and fragments the process inaccurately.
  - **Incorrect RACI assignments**: Nearly all assignments deviate substantially from the ground truth, missing key involvements (e.g., Consulted/Informed roles for other parties in Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, and Risk Scoring). For Risk Scoring, the LLM incorrectly assigns full R/A to Compliance Analyst, ignoring the ground truth's split (Compliance R, Officer A, Front-Office C, Treasury I). Escalation and scheduling are mishandled as separate activities with wrong roles (e.g., Compliance Analyst as C for scheduling, but ground truth integrates this into Approval and Release Funds with broader consultations).
  - **Incomplete coverage of process**: While it attempts to cover "every activity and role", it fails to accurately map the full narrative (e.g., no distinct "Approval" step; notification is added separately instead of being implied in Release Funds). This results in an incomplete or distorted RACI, not faithfully representing the escalation (>70), low-risk path (≤70), and notification.
  - **Formatting and minor errors**: Uses hyphens (-) instead of en dashes (–) for no involvement; no bolding of activity names as in ground truth; table alignment is centered unnecessarily, deviating from ground truth's left alignment. "R/A" vs. "R, A" is a small inconsistency. These are minor but deduct points per strictness instruction.
- **Overall**: The answer captures the vocabulary policy (worth ~40% credit) but fundamentally fails on process fidelity, RACI accuracy, and adherence to "do not add" (60% weight). With utmost strictness, even these partial alignments can't offset the core mismatches, leading to a low-mid score.
