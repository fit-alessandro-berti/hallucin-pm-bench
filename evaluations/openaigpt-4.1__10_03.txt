4.5

The answer partially fulfills the requirements but has several significant discrepancies and errors:

**Strengths:**
- The four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," "Risk Scoring") are all used correctly and without any synonym leakage.
- No unauthorized synonyms appear.

**Major Issues:**
1. **Incorrect Activities/Deviations from Ground Truth:**
   - The answer introduces extra/unlisted activities ("Escalation for approval (>70)", "Payment scheduling (≤70)", "Funds release", and "Notification to originating analyst") that were NOT included in the required activity list of the ground truth.
   - Does NOT include "Compliance Officer Approval" (required in ground truth), instead only referencing escalation generically.
   - The activity "Release Funds" is altered to "Funds release".
   - Lacks adherence to the explicit activity list (no merging, renaming, or adding activities allowed).

2. **Improper Role Assignments:**
   - For several activities, missing multiple "C" (Consulted), "I" (Informed), or assignments that ground truth includes.
   - Use of "R/A" notation for a single box, instead of separate R and A if they're held by different roles (especially "Risk Scoring" where Accountable is Compliance Officer, not Analyst).
   - Some roles are fully omitted from activities where they should be "C" or "I".

3. **Formatting:** 
   - Diverges from the sample table structure provided by the ground truth, introducing its own notation ("R/A", just "R", etc.), and inconsistent logic.

**Summary:**  
While the LLM answer avoids forbidden synonyms and consistently uses the mandated vocabulary, it does not faithfully follow the activity breakdown given, incorrectly adds/splits/renames activities, and misassigns RACI roles for several process steps. These errors represent serious nonadherence to strict process-governance instructions. 

**Score is lowered significantly from perfect for each type of error—hence 4.5.**
