The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth in correctness, structure (bold "No" followed by justification citing exact lines and case-ids), key counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 with reversed order; C005 lacking Receive_Order), and logical disproof of the "always" claim. Phrasing differences (e.g., "without any intervening Receive_Order" vs. "never contains... at all") are stylistic and equally precise/accurate given the log's per-case sequences, with no factual errors, omissions, or deviations warranting deduction even under strict evaluation.
