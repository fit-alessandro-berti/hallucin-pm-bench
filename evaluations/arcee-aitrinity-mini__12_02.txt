The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering "No" and identifying the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11 with no prior Receive_Order), with precise citations matching the log. Justification is concise, in one paragraph as prompted, and factually verifies the claim's falsity. Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary mention of compliant cases C002/C004 (absent in ground truth, introduces extraneous detail despite correctness); (2) phrasing "no preceding *Receive_Order* in this segment" slightly less precise than ground truth's "never contains *Receive_Order* at all" (implies potential incompleteness vs. definitive for the fragment); (3) "not verified" vs. "false" (subtle semantic shift); (4) lack of bullet structure mirroring ground truth's format. These small differences warrant a strict but not severe penalty from perfection.
