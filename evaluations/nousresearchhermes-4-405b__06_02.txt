The LLM answer accurately identifies and enumerates all three sets of concurrently-executable tasks for Process B, using numbered lines and comma-separated task names matching the ground truth answer. It refrains from mentioning tasks from other processes and does not include sequential-only tasks. The only, albeit minor, deviation is that the LLM adds unrequested explanatory notes (parallel block names and brief remarks) after each line; while informative, these were not called for, thus slightly exceeding the instructions and warranting a deduction. Otherwise, the factual content is entirely correct.
