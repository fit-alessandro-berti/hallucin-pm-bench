The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks with exact task lists matching the ground truth. However, it includes extraneous introductory text, explanatory annotations after each line (e.g., references to block dependencies), and a concluding paragraph that discusses sequential tasks (explicitly mentioning "Dry_Fit_Assembly," which violates the instruction to exclude sequential tasks). This deviates from the strict format of "numbered lines; in each line list the tasks... separated by commas," resulting in a deduction for non-adherence to the specified output structure.
