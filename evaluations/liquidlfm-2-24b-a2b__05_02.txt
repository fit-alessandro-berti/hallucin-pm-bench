**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically: invalid non-unified diff format (no `@@`, `-/+` lines, single hunk); modifies wrong element (`sequenceFlow` instead of `userTask`), adds invalid/irrelevant `camunda:dueDate="P4D"` to `Flow_5` without removing anything; rationale mismatches diff (claims change to `Task_CollectEquipment` but alters flow) and invents incorrect improvement (extension vs. reduction, wrong task, no 3-day SLA alignment); violates output rules entirely.
