**2.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in critical ways, warranting a severe deduction under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Wrong attachment point**: Timer on `Task_Check` (post-Receive) vs. ground truth's `Task_Receive` (proximal to submission start).
- **Incorrect target**: New flow to repurposed `Task_RequestDocs` (semantically conflicts with its doc-request role; phrasing implies "new task") vs. direct to `Task_Triage`.
- **Invalid repurposing**: Modifies existing task's name/documentation (unnecessary, alters original purpose) vs. ground truth's clean bypass with no changes to tasks.
- **Improper duration**: Vague "48 hours" vs. BPMN-standard `PT48H`.
- **No XML syntax**: Lacks `<bpmn:timeDuration>` snippet.
- **Flawed logic/explanation**: Doesn't bypass "outstanding document requests"; timer starts too late for true submission-to-triage SLA.

Core improvement mismatches entirely; minor alignments (e.g., interrupting timer, new flow ID, brevity) insufficient for higher score.
