1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on both questions, directly contradicting the ground truth. It wrongly concludes "No" for Q1 by misinterpreting the Petri net structure—claiming T4 requires T3, ignoring that P4 can be reached via T2→T7 without T3, allowing T5 (needing P2 and P5) to fire first while P2 remains untapped. No valid sequence is provided, and the explanation is factually erroneous. This is a complete reversal of the truth, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
