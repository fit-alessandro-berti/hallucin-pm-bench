10.0

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content (3 cases listed correctly; correct preceding activity "Pack_Items"; correct unique activity "Cancel_Order"). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., added phrasing for conciseness, numbering as "1." vs. "A1", bolding/quotes) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they align with the prompt's "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction and preserve exact semantic match. No factual deviations, chronological misinterpretations, or inaccuracies detected.
