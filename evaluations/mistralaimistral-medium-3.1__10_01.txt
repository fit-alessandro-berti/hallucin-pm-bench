### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Compliance (positive, +2.0 points)**: The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization and no mention of forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). This aligns perfectly with the vocabulary policy and ground truth.
  
- **Structure and Format (partial, +1.0 point)**: The matrix format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks or roles are added, adhering to the "unwarranted content" criterion. However, deductions for: (1) using abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full role names as in ground truth; (2) inconsistent bolding (LLM bolds all activities/headers excessively, while ground truth selectively bolds key RACI entries like **R / A**); (3) minor formatting nit (e.g., **R/A** lacks space, vs. ground truth's **R / A**). These are small but warrant significant loss under strictness rules.

- **RACI Allocations (major failures, -3.0 points from base)**: Only 1/6 activities (Order Vetting) matches ground truth exactly. The other 5 have multiple errors:
  - Receive Application: CO is I (should be C).
  - KYC Review: AM is C (should be A); CO is R/A (should be R); FC is I (should be C).
  - Payment Clearance: AM is C (should be A); CO is I (should be C); FC is R/A (should be R).
  - Record Update: AM is I (should be C); FC is I (should be C); IT is R/A (should be R).
  - Notify Customer: IT is C (should be I).
  These violate the notes' "Correctness" criterion: Allocations do not reflect the narrative (e.g., ground truth separates R and A distinctly where needed, like AM as A for KYC/Payment; multiple consulted roles like FC C for KYC/Record). While each activity has one Responsible (good), the mismatches are pervasive and not "appropriate" for accountability (e.g., AM should be A in more places per narrative/process description).

- **Unwarranted Content (negative, -1.5 points)**: Includes introductory text ("Here is the **RACI matrix**...") and a "Key" explanation, which are absent in ground truth. This adds extraneous material, violating the no-extra-content rule. Self-awareness is N/A, as noted.

Overall, while terminology is flawless, the core RACI content (the matrix's purpose) has ~80% error rate across activities, leading to a low score despite basic structure. Strict rubric demands near-perfect alignment for high marks; these differences (even small per cell) compound to significant loss.
