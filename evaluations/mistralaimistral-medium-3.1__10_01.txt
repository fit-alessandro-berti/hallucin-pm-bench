8.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer adheres strictly to the preferred terminology ("KYC Review," "Order Vetting," "Payment Clearance") and avoids all forbidden terms, as required.
- The structure (activities as rows, roles as columns) is correct. 
- The RACI matrix has no extra roles, columns, or activities.
- A concise and correct key is provided (though not strictly required), and no unnecessary information (like the banned terms) appears.
- Activities are matched up correctly to their equivalents in the process description and ground truth.

**Issues (leading to the loss of points):**
1. **Assignment correctness mistakes (considered major):**
   - *Receive Application*:  
     - LLM marks CO, FC, IT as "Informed" (I), while ground truth marks CO as "Consulted" (C) and only FC/IT are "I".  
   - *KYC Review*:  
     - LLM marks AM as "Consulted" (C), but ground truth has AM as "Accountable" (A) and FC as Consulted (C).
     - LLM marks FC as "Informed" (I), but ground truth marks FC as "Consulted" (C).
     - LLM marks IT as "Informed" (I), matching ground truth.
   - *Order Vetting*:  
     - LLM marks CO as "Consulted" (C), which matches ground truth, as does the rest.
   - *Payment Clearance*:  
     - LLM marks AM as "Consulted" (C), but in ground truth AM is "Accountable" (A); ground truth also has CO as "Consulted" (C), FC as "Responsible/Accountable" (R), both somewhat at odds with LLM matrix.
   - *Record Update*:  
     - LLM marks AM as "Informed", but ground truth marks AM as "Consulted" (C); LLM marks FC as "Informed", but ground truth has FC as "Consulted" (C).
   - *Notify Customer*:  
     - LLM marks IT as "Consulted" (C), while ground truth marks IT as "Informed" (I).
     - LLM gives only AM "R/A", ground truth gives only "R/A" to AM, so this is correct except for IT.

2. **Format—Minor:** LLM bolds or styles some content that ground truth doesn't, but since the instruction does not prohibit it and table is readable, it's not penalized.

**Scoring rationale:**  
- The most important factor is accuracy. While overall structure and terminology are perfect, several RACI cell-level assignments are incorrect; even a couple of mismatches are a significant error under strict grading.  
- However, the table is not vastly off; most rows and roles roughly correspond, and no forbidden terms appear.  
- The errors are significant—but contextually, the table is not a total mismatch, so not below 7.

**Final: 8.0** for strong adherence to required terminology and structure, but notable (though not catastrophic) mistakes in several role assignments.
