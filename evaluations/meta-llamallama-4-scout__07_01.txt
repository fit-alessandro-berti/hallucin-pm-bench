6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway), with no speculation or extraneous details. However, under strict evaluation:

- **Headings mismatch**: Prompt requires *exact* headings "• Added tasks", etc. LLM adds an unrequired "### Summary of Changes" header, uses bold (**), and includes the bullet in the heading itself, deviating from the specified format. Ground truth uses simple bold headings without extra prefix or title. (-1.0 point)
  
- **Task listings incomplete**: LLM lists only task IDs (e.g., "check_vip"), but prompt instructs to use "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," which includes both ID and name attributes (e.g., name="Check Customer VIP Status"). Ground truth fully captures this by listing names with IDs in backticks. This omission of names is a significant factual shortfall, as it reduces readability and completeness of XML-derived differences. (-2.0 points)
  
- **Gateway formatting minor deviation**: LLM uses backticks for types and omits version labels "(v1)" and "(v2)" present in ground truth, making it less precise. Ground truth also includes an explanatory note, but LLM's core description is accurate—just less detailed. (-0.5 point)

Total deductions from 10.0 yield 6.5. The answer is functionally correct but fails on exactness, completeness, and format adherence.
