**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major flaws (severe point loss)**: LLM uses `intermediateCatchEvent` (incorrect for task-duration timing; BPMN standard requires `boundaryEvent` attached to the activity for interruption). Claims "attaching to sequence flow entering `Activity_CreateAccount`" is invalid—sequence flows cannot have attached events; this XML snippet is non-functional without proper placement/flow integration.
- **Incomplete handling**: No outgoing `sequenceFlow` defined from the event (timeout leads nowhere); ignores the existing unused `Activity_AMReview` escalation path, missing the task's explicit constraint to leverage pre-existing elements.
- **Timer semantics mismatch**: Placement on incoming flow (if even possible) starts timer post-gateway but fails to precisely enforce "within 48 hours of finishing Verify Identity" via task interruption; lacks `cancelActivity="true"` and `attachedToRef`.
- **Minor matches (partial credit)**: Correct duration `PT48H`, no new activities added, format (XML snippet + 1-sentence justification) followed, intent to interrupt `Create Account`.
- **Overall**: Fundamentally divergent from ground truth (wrong event type/placement, no escalation routing), rendering it non-compliant and unusable; >80% differences warrant near-minimal score under strict criteria.
