The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a valid, accurate justification centered on the key counterexample in case C003 (citing line 7 precisely and noting the absence of subsequent Validate_Payment, which directly falsifies the claim under the standard interpretation that every Receive_Order must be followed by Validate_Payment). This aligns well with the ground truth's use of C003 as a counterexample, even if phrased differently (lack of subsequent vs. order reversal). Minor deduction for the irrelevant additional note on C002 (not a violation, as "follows" does not require immediacy, and it introduces unnecessary detail) and for not mentioning C005 or the preceding Validate_Payment in line 6 of C003 (though C005 is arguably not a strict counterexample, as the claim does not require Receive_Order before every Validate_Payment). Overall, highly faithful to the log and prompt requirements, with precise citations and one-paragraph structure.
