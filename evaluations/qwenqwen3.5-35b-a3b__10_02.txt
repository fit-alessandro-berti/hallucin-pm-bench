**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Major structural differences (deducts ~4 points)**: LLM uses traditional "Task | R | A | C | I" format with roles in cells. Ground truth uses "Task | Role1 | Role2 | Role3 | Role4" format with R/A/C/I letters in cells (bolded for R/A). Completely incompatible formats; no legend provided in LLM.
- **Role omissions/inventions mismatch (deducts ~2 points)**: LLM correctly limits to mandated roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison) + source (IT Support), but lacks Ground Truth's "Operations Manager" column and all its assignments (A in nearly every row).
- **Task coverage and wording errors (deducts ~1.5 points)**: LLM has 7 tasks (extra "Transmit SWIFT Message" not in GT); GT has 6. Wording differs significantly: e.g., "Receive and Log Transfer Instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Conduct KYC Review" vs. "**KYC Review**"; "Authorize Payment Release" vs. "Release Payment"; "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record". Small phrasing variances (e.g., "Payment Against Sanctions List" vs. "Against Sanctions List"; singular "Transaction" vs. plural) compound under strictness.
- **RACI assignments mismatch (deducts ~0.5 points)**: No row fully matches. Partial overlaps (e.g., TA R for Receive/Screen/Release; RL R for KYC/Approve) but extras/omissions everywhere (e.g., no Ops A/C/I; incorrect Informed/Consulted).
- **Minor formatting/details (no further deduction needed, already minimal score)**: No header "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"; no bolding; no post-table notes/legend.

LLM adheres to prompt's vocabulary mandate but deviates heavily from Ground Truth in every other aspect, warranting minimal score under "utmost strictness" where even small errors cause "significant loss."
