The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring A as instructed), with perfect alphabetical ordering within pairs (Create_Documentation before Quality_Check; Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines) and across the list (C-pair before P-pair). No extra or missing pairs. Task names are exact matches.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Spacing around "—" does not precisely match the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (appears to use single space before "—", vs. two spaces shown in prompt example and ground truth first line).
- Lacks vertical alignment of "—" (ground truth second line pads with extra spaces after "Procure_Materials" to align under first line's "—").
- Missing code block wrapper (ground truth uses ```) and initial blank line within it.
- Minor whitespace discrepancies (e.g., post-"—" spacing consistency).

These are small formatting errors, but per instructions warrant significant point deduction (10.0 perfect match → 9.0). Content is flawless.
