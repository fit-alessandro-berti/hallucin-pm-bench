**Evaluation Rationale (strict criteria applied):**

- **Part 1 (10/10):** Exact match—correct count (1), references CaseID 1002 precisely, no errors.
- **Part 2 (8.5/10):** Core ideas align (tiny sample → high variance/sampling error; inconsistent fraud-check labeling → strict vs. fuzzy matching risks distorting estimates). Concise (<120 words), data-grounded. Deductions for omissions (no explicit 14 events, <2-hour span, 0%-7% frequency swing, confidence interval) and minor additions (framing as "Selection Bias"/"Inconsistent Labeling"/outlier; less quantitative rigor than GT). Significant but not disqualifying differences under utmost strictness. Overall strong fidelity.
