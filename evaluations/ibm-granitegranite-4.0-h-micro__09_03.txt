The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in structure, content, and intent: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to absent data in Artefact A, specifies the lack of timestamps and rows needed for "Approve Invoice," and explains the inability to compute the required metrics (average, SD, CI) without guessing. Minor deductions for not explicitly using "redacted" (as in the prompt/ground truth), introducing "durations" (not a direct column; cycle time derives from timestamps), and omitting the call for "additional raw log entries," which slightly reduces precision under strict evaluation criteria.
