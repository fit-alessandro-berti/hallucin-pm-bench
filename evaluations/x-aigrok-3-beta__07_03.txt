Reasoning:
- The LLM answer contains all functionally correct identifications of changes: all added/removed tasks and gateway type changes are listed, with precise IDs and names/types, and under proper headings.
- Errors:
  - Headings do not match the ground truth's format exactly (the LLM uses markdown list dashes, while the required format expects just the heading as a line, not as a list item with a dash).
  - The gateway change entries do not align under each other (lack of indentation for columns, as in the ground truth, i.e., "Gateway_Payment" entry is not aligned).
- These are format violations as per instructions to use the three headings "verbatim and in this order".
- No extraneous commentary or incorrect differences.
- Strict loss for the formatting/headings issue, but no informational omission or additions.
