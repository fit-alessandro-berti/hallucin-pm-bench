The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth in terms of content: it correctly identifies all added tasks, the removed task, and both gateway type changes without any omissions, additions, or commentary. However, strict evaluation reveals minor formatting deviations that warrant a deduction: (1) inclusion of leading dashes before each heading (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS"), which the ground truth omits for plain headings; (2) lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (ground truth has extra spaces after the colon in "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel" for visual alignment, while the LLM uses a single space matching the example format but diverging from the ground truth). These small inconsistencies in verbatim output structure reduce the score, but the core accuracy is excellent.
