The LLM correctly identifies the two relevant pairs (Procure_Materials with Schedule_Machines, and Create_Documentation with Quality_Check) and sorts them appropriately both within pairs and in the overall list (alphabetical by first task name). However, the response incurs severe penalties for: (1) using abbreviations (e.g., "CD", "PM") instead of full task names as specified in the process description and expected in the format "Task_X — Task_Y", which directly mismatches the ground truth and prompt intent; (2) including extensive extraneous reasoning text instead of a clean output of only the pairs (one per line); (3) incorrect spacing around the em dash (lacks the double spaces before/after as in the prompt's format example); and (4) failing to align or format the output precisely as in the ground truth (e.g., no padding spaces for alignment). These are not minor; they render the output non-compliant and unusable as a direct response to the task, warranting a low score despite conceptual accuracy on parallelism.
