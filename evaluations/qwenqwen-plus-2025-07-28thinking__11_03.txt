7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint criteria of SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth. Quantification of excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and inclusion of waiting times are accurate and data-grounded. Memo structure is appropriate (To/From/Subject, analysis paragraph, bulleted recommendations only), adhering to format instructions, with word count ≈160 (close to ≈150 target). No absent activities or metrics are mentioned.

However, significant deductions for differences in recommendations: LLM's are generic ("increase staffing") with invented projections (e.g., specific waiting time reductions like 600s → 300s, not supported by data, violating "do NOT invent" and "data-driven" requirements), lacking the tailored, activity-specific concreteness of the ground truth (e.g., rule-based pre-checks, automation). No end-to-end projection or total cases mention, missing ground truth's holistic closure. Minor wording/structure variances (e.g., less formal subject, no bolding) add small but notable gaps under strict criteria.
