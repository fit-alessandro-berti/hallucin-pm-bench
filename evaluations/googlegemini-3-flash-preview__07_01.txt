The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, gateway `gw_valid` type change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway), matching the core content of the ground truth. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Missing task names**: Lists only IDs for added/removed tasks, omitting exact names from XML (`Check Customer VIP Status`, `Generate RMA QR Code`, `Send RMA Label`) presented prominently in ground truth with ID as secondary. Significant content omission (-1.5).
- **Gateway phrasing**: Concise but lacks `(v1)`/`(v2)` versioning, backticks, and bolding on types (-0.5).
- **Formatting differences**: Matches prompt's exact headings with `•` (superior to ground truth's `**`), but uses `-` bullets vs ground truth's `*`; no final note (-1.0).

Factual accuracy high, but presentation and detail mismatches deduct significantly per strict criteria.
