The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a valid justification by citing the key counterexample in case C003 (lines 6–7), which alone disproves the "always" claim. This aligns well with the prompt's requirements for a binary answer followed by a one-paragraph justification referencing lines or case-IDs. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits the additional counterexample in case C005 (lines 11–12), where *Validate_Payment* occurs without any preceding *Receive_Order*, as highlighted in the ground truth. This omission, while not fatal to the overall correctness, represents a significant gap in fully mirroring the ground truth's comprehensive analysis of all exceptions, warranting a deduction from a perfect score.
