The LLM answer is semantically identical in conclusion and core reasoning (no timestamps prevent cycle time calculation), highly concise, and directly addresses the prompt's requirement for a one-sentence explanation. Minor deductions for format (bold header + sentence vs. single integrated sentence), slightly less precise wording (omits "duration information," "event counts," and "start-to-completion intervals"), and not explicitly restating the activity/target metric, per strict evaluation criteria.
