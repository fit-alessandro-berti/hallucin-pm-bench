- The LLM answer correctly identifies the number of distinct cases, the immediately preceding activity for C456 before "Ship_Order," and the activity that appears exactly once.
- Very minor difference: In answer 3, where the ground truth says "Cancel_Order", the LLM says "The only activity appearing exactly once is Cancel_Order" (slightly more verbose).  
- Reason for point deduction: Strictness asks for concise bullet-point answers, and the LLM's statement for question 3 is slightly less concise than the ground truth (not just naming the activity, but explaining it), which, according to strictness, carries minor but non-negligible loss of points.

All factual content is correct, making it very close to perfect, but the instruction for conciseness was not followed with maximal precision.
