9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all and only the factual differences required:

- **Added tasks:** Correctly lists the new tasks, including both the id and name, fully matching the ground truth.
- **Removed tasks:** Correctly identifies the removed task, with both id and name, matching the ground truth.
- **Gateway type changes:** Accurately reports the change in gateway type for `gw_valid`, including both old and new types and the id.

However, the LLM formatted the differences with XML snippets (e.g., `<task id="check_vip" name="Check Customer VIP Status"/>`) rather than just listing "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)", as requested by the ground truth. Also, while the LLM's answer adds a polite closing sentence ("If you have further questions..."), which is extraneous per the prompt's strict instructions.

**These small formatting and extraneous content differences merit a significant but not maximal penalty, leading to a score of 9.0.**
