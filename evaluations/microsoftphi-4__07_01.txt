6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the factual differences in tasks and the gateway type change, aligning with the core requirements and the ground truth content. However, under strict evaluation:

- **Heading format mismatch**: Uses "####" markdown instead of the exact "â€¢ Added tasks" etc., as specified. This is a direct deviation (-1.0 point).
- **Task listing format**: Includes full XML tags (e.g., `<task id="check_vip" .../>`), which goes beyond using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML" and does not match the ground truth's concise name + ID format. This adds unnecessary verbosity (-1.0 point).
- **Gateway description**: Similarly verbose with full tags, unlike the ground truth's precise type + ID + version notation (-0.5 point).
- **Extra content**: Includes an unsolicited offer for further questions/analysis, violating the "only factual differences" and "do not speculate" rules (-1.0 point).
- No "(none)" for empty categories or affirming note like the ground truth, but this is minor since all categories have content.

These errors, while not altering the facts, introduce formatting inconsistencies and extraneous text, warranting a mid-range score despite accurate detection of changes.
