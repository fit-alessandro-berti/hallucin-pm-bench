**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct, complete, and aligns precisely with the ground truth in substance: correct "No" verdict, accurate assessment of all four rules (identifying the exact Rule 3 violation due to NA preceding RA, while confirming satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4), and appropriate referencing/justification. Minor stylistic differences (bullets vs. table, step numbering vs. general phrasing, explicit "exactly once" phrasing) are present but do not alter meaning, accuracy, or compliance with the prompt's requirements for a short justification referencing each rule. No errors or omissions.
