The LLM answer accurately states that the requested metrics cannot be computed due to the absence of data, correctly referencing the redacted event-log and the lack of timestamp values. It appropriately emphasizes that no metrics can be calculated for "Approve Invoice" activity in the current state.

However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer is slightly verbose and spends more words on explaining unrelated aspects, such as what the column headers represent and information about Artefact B's historical aggregate KPI (which is not directly relevant). The ground truth is more concise and focused strictly on the impossibility and the direct reason (missing rows/timestamps).

Small verbosity and some elaboration that slightly distracts from the primary reason warrant a minor point deduction under strict grading.
