9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Nearly perfect match ("1 time" vs. "1 occurrence"); minor wording variation deducts 0.1 points for strictness on phrasing.
- **Question 2**: Exact match on value and rounding ("5.56%"); negligible formatting difference (no space before %) deducts 0.1 points.
- **Question 3**: Correct identifier listed, but lacks the explicit "only case" emphasis and full phrasing from ground truth; concise but not fully precise, deducts 0.4 points.
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid sampling-related reasons (temporal bias via short period; small sample size with specifics on events/cases) that align with ground truth examples (temporal bias and small sample size). However, lacks deeper elaboration (e.g., variance impact or percentage change as in ground truth), deducting 0.2 points for insufficient detail under strict criteria.
- **Overall**: No hallucinations or inferences beyond the log; highly accurate but minor deviations in precision and elaboration prevent a perfect score.
