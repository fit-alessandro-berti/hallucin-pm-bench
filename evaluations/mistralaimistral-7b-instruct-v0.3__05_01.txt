**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in every key aspect: wrong timer placement (after Task_Check vs. boundary on Task_Receive), invalid BPMN (malformed conditionExpression with forbidden nested scriptTask, milliseconds vs. PT48H), incorrect escalation (to Task_RequestDocs vs. direct bypass to Task_Triage), no interrupting boundary timer or new sequenceFlow to Triage, added prohibited scriptTask, non-plain English with lists/code exceeding 120 words, and failure to reference correctly (e.g., no Timer_48h). Functionally incorrect and violates constraints.
