The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets in Process B, with accurate task names and ordering, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements for listing and numbering. Minor deductions for formatting differences (e.g., bullet points vs. inline notation with â€– symbols; descriptive headers like "(after Parallel Split #1)" vs. "first parallel block") and omission of the ground truth's closing sentence, which, under strict evaluation, reflect small but notable deviations from the exact structure and phrasing.
