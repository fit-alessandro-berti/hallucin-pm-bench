**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a) – Major failures (severe point loss)**:
  - Identifies **4 decision points** instead of exactly **2** per ground truth; invents extras (e.g., Tri-Color-Risk-Check is a step/check with outcome, *not* a "decision point/gate/branch"; Manual-Underwriting-Review is a step, *not* a decision).
  - Misses precise ground-truth phrasing/naming: e.g., no "**Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check**"; TriVote lacks "**at least two of the three approvers... record 'Approve'**" exactness (LLM's "any two... sufficient" is close but not identical to process/ground truth).
  - Not strictly "one sentence each" with exact rule fidelity; bloated and inaccurate.

- **Part (b) – Critical omissions/duplications (severe point loss)**:
  - Lists only **5 entries** vs. ground truth's **9**; **completely misses** the 3 core inputs/documents (**Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow**), which first appear in step 3 order – this is a massive hallucination-by-omission.
  - Duplicates **Offer Sheet 77** unnecessarily; fails to distinguish "**Signed Offer Sheet 77**" as separate from unsigned (step 7 vs. 8); lists "**ID Matrix Declaration**" bundled incorrectly without order fidelity.
  - Wrong order/granularity: e.g., Deck Memo appears *after* scorecards in process/first-appearance.

- **Overall**: Partial credit for capturing ~50% of real elements (e.g., skip condition gist, TriVote rule, some docs like Form 14B/Deck Memo/Offer Sheet/Loan Dossier), but strict rules demand near-exact match – omissions of scorecards alone warrant floor-level score; extras/wrongs compound. No hallucinations of absent items (e.g., no KYC), but fidelity too low for >2.0.
