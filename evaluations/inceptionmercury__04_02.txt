6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths**: Correct overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). R3, R4, and R6 match ground truth status and justification closely (≤20 words). R5 status correct, justification mostly aligns (minor omission of Pay_Invoice, but captures essence). Format is list-based but follows prompt structure reasonably.
- **Weaknesses (Strict Penalties)**: R1 incorrectly marked Violated (should be Compliant); justification misunderstands rule scope—initial approvals satisfy R1, change doesn't retroactively violate order (major error, -2.0). R2 incorrectly marked Compliant (should be Violated); justification ignores post-change approval timing and new Manager_Approval on 07-Mar, treating initial Finance_Approval as "last required" (major error, -2.0). No table format as in ground truth, though prompt doesn't strictly require it (-0.5 for deviation). Total deductions reflect two critical rule misjudgments, halving score potential despite partial accuracies.
