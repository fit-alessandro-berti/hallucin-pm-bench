6.0

- R1: LLM incorrectly marked as "Violated". Approvals were correctly sequenced before change, but rule only requires initial approvals (does not mandate repeated sequence after change unless Change_Request triggers new approvals, which is covered specifically in R5).
- R2: Marked as "Compliant" by LLM, but after Change_Request, the final approval (new Manager Approval) is on 07-Mar, so Ship_Goods on 05-Mar is too early—should be "Violated".
- R3: Correctly marked as "Violated".
- R4: Correctly "Not Applicable".
- R5: Correctly "Violated"—justification is alright.
- R6: Correctly "Compliant".
- Overall result is correct.

There are multiple critical errors: misinterpretation of rules R1 and R2 (both key to the scenario). Even small mistakes in rule logic cause significant point loss per instructions.
