**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in verdict, coverage of all cases, key observations (reversed order in 1001/1003, absence in 1002), contradiction to "always" and "immediately before," and data citations (timestamps precisely match log and are equivalent/superior to line numbers for verification). Stylistic differences (numbered vs. bullets, order of cases, phrasing, extra accurate summary sentence) are minor and do not alter meaning, justification strength, or adherence to prompt. No errors or omissions.
