9.5

The LLM answer fully meets the prompt's core requirements: correct identification and ranking of the three worst activities by waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), verbatim quoting of both average and 95th-percentile waiting times, no mention of service times/throughput/other activities, and concise format under 150 words (~120 words). Each action is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., reminders for external delays, automation for queuing, routing for internal bottlenecks), and data-driven with ≥20% reduction claims supported by referenced evidence (simulations, historical data), avoiding unsupported invention.

Minor deductions for: slight formatting differences (full memo header vs. ground truth's bullets; "95th percentile" vs. "p95"); action phrasings diverge from ground truth (e.g., multi-channel reminders vs. 24h escalation; event-driven sending vs. e-signature batch replacement; priority routing vs. rules-engine pre-classification), introducing non-identical but equivalently valid recommendations. No major errors or violations.
