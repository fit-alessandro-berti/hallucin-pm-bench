**Evaluation:**

1. Correct: The answer states that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs exactly **1** time, matching the ground truth.
2. Correct: The calculation for the percentage is exactly as required, showing **5.56%** and demonstrating the intermediate step, as in the ground truth.
3. Correct: The case identifier is precisely listed as **A1002**.
4. Very Minor Issue: The two reasons given are (1) limited time duration ("covers only a single day") and (2) small sample size. These map directly to "temporal bias" and "small sample size" listed in the ground truth. While both are clearly valid and concisely expressed, the answer does not mention "case-mix bias" or "survivorship/truncation bias," but only two reasons were required. 

The only minuscule shortcoming is that the description of time span says "a single day" instead of specifying the "morning" (the correct, stricter time window according to timestamps), a finer level of detail for temporal bias. This is a very minor deviation, but per instructions, even small imprecision should result in a loss of points.

**Conclusion:**  
All concrete answers are correct, and both sampling reasons are valid and within the scope requested. Only a minor imprecision in specifying the fragment's temporal coverage (noticing itâ€™s the "morning" not "day") causes the 0.5 point deduction.
