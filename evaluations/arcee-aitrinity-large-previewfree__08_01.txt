1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it concludes **No** (impossible), but the ground truth correctly states **Yes** (possible via T1 → T2 → T5 → T3). The LLM's reasoning contains multiple errors (e.g., claims T5 enabled immediately after T1 despite p3=0; assumes "correct runs" to final marking, irrelevant to the question of reachability; ignores valid prefix sequence T1-T2-T5 where T5 precedes T3). Even minor issues like the ground truth's unreachable T4 are irrelevant, as the question requires only existence of a sequence showing T5 before T3, which LLM denies. Strict evaluation demands 1.0 for reversed conclusion and flawed analysis.
