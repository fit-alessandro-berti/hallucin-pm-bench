1.0

The LLM answer fundamentally errs by concluding "No" when the ground truth is "Yes," missing the key role of the T2b shortcut (bypassing pc to enable pd early) and the T6 feedback loop (re-enabling pc for T3 post-T5). It fails to identify any valid sequence, provides an incorrect formal explanation based on false sequential dependencies, and contains minor marking errors (e.g., inconsistent pb notation in Step 2). This complete reversal of the correct outcome warrants the minimum score under strict criteria.
