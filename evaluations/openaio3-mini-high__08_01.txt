### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible for T5 to fire before T3, providing a valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) with detailed markings and a brief justification focused on the inhibitor arc condition (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0), directly addressing the prompt's requirements without extraneous errors. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core response.

However, strict deductions apply for the following differences:
- **Depth of justification (significant loss: -1.0)**: The LLM answer confirms possibility but omits the ground truth's key insight that T5 "must" fire before T3 (if it fires at all) due to permanent disablement post-T3, as p4 is only cleared by T4 alongside p3. This makes the LLM's explanation less comprehensive, though still accurate and brief as requested.
- **Sequence completeness (minor loss: -0.5)**: The LLM stops after T5 (correctly showing T3 unfired), while the ground truth extends to include T3 and T4. Although the ground truth's extension contains an inconsistency (T4 cannot fire after T5 since p3=0, rendering step 5 impossible), this difference in scope reduces similarity.

No factual errors in the LLM answer; it is precise and avoids the ground truth's flaw, but the partial mismatch in explanatory nuance prevents a perfect score.
