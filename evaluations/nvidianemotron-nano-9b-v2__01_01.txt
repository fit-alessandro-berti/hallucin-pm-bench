7.0

**Justification:**

**Positives:**
- The answer lists all decision points explicitly and does not introduce any undocumented activities or artefacts.
- All required documents are enumerated, with their roles briefly and correctly indicated.
- The "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" legacy activity is correctly noted as excluded.

**Errors & Omissions (strict evaluation):**
1. **Decision point structure and detail:**
   - The answer splits the "amount threshold" into its own decision point, which is partially correct, BUT does not clarify that the threshold is evaluated *after* pre-approval (sequence/logic is not explicit). The ground truth is explicit about this, including both location and logic.
   - The LLM answer omits the "final payment approval" step as a discrete decision point (Ground truth point #3, i.e., the payment is only made if all approvals are obtained; if rejected, process ends). This is a significant omission.
   - The answer does NOT describe outcome branches for each decision point (e.g., "if not eligible > claim rejected"; "if not pre-approved > process ends"), whereas the ground truth is specific about outcomes and their process significance.
   
2. **Documents list context:**
   - The answer lists all the documents but does not clarify that *AuditTrail* is only for high-value claims (whereas the ground truth labels this as “only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue”).
   - There is no explicit note about process constraints on documents (e.g., that *BankTransferAuthorization* is required before payment). It's implied but not explained.
   - The documents' usage and conditional nature (e.g., *AuditTrail*) are not sufficiently nuanced.

**Result:**  
While the answer is accurate in content and makes no fabricated claims, it loses significant points for not capturing decision outcomes/branches, missing a full accounting of the final payment approval decision point, and failing to provide contextual/conditional information about some documents. These are not trivial issues. Therefore, **7.0** is the strict score.
