7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major differences, significant deduction)**: The LLM answer identifies three decision points, which aligns in number with the ground truth but differs in structure, detail, and completeness. It correctly captures the triage eligibility check and the high-value threshold branch but misplaces or incompletely describes the approval logic. Specifically:
  - It treats **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** as a standalone decision without specifying branching outcomes (e.g., no mention of "Approved → proceed" vs. "Rejected → end without payment").
  - It omits **Senior_Auditor_Review** as an explicit decision point with potential rejection (ground truth folds this into "final payment approval," but LLM implies senior review without noting its decisional nature or outcomes like process ending on rejection).
  - No branching logic is provided for any point (e.g., ground truth details "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → rejected" for triage, "> €1 000 → include review; ≤ €1 000 → skip" for threshold, and approval/rejection for final step; LLM only vaguely states "whether eligible/approve" or "proceeds if exceeds"). This lacks the "branching logic/outcomes" emphasis in the ground truth, making the summary less precise and comprehensive. The high-value check is accurately placed after pre-approval, but the overall categorization doesn't match the ground truth's integration of approvals. Format (simple list vs. table) is a minor issue but contributes to less clarity. This section warrants a ~6.0 equivalent score due to incompleteness and deviation.
- **Required Documents (strong match, no deduction)**: The list is identical in content, order, and caveats (e.g., AuditTrail for high-value only; no extras like legacy activities). The added note mirrors the ground truth's disclaimer. Perfect alignment, ~10.0.
- **Overall**: No introductions of undefined elements (adheres to prompt). Strict weighting (decisions are core to the prompt, ~70% emphasis) pulls the score down from a higher mark, but completeness on documents and no major fabrications prevent a lower grade. Total reflects ~75% fidelity to ground truth structure and detail.
