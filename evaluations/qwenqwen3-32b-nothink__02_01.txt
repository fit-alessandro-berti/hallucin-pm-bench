8.0

The LLM answer is almost entirely correct, with the answers to Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 being exactly correct. The only error is in Q5, where it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as an activity that never appears as the first event of any case. In the log, "Quality_Check" is indeed the first event for case "C-77"; so including it is a mistake. All other items are correct. This is a significant but not catastrophic error, thus the score is an 8.0.
