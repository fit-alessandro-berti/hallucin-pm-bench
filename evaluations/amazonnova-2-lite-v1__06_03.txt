The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two concurrent task sets from Process B in the correct order, with no extraneous information about Processes A or C, fully matching the core content of the ground truth. Minor deductions for:
- Verbose additions (intro sentence, parenthetical explanations referencing splits/merges, summary section repeating the lists), which introduce unrequested details.
- Formatting differences (bullets/bold/headers/separators vs. ground truth's concise numbered inline lists with backticks and ‖ symbol).
- Omission of the explicit "No other tasks..." closure (though implied).

Under utmost strictness, these presentation and extraneous elements prevent a perfect score, but the response is highly accurate and directly responsive.
