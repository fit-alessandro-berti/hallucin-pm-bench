The LLM answer correctly identifies all three concurrent task sets with exact task names and comma-separated formatting matching the ground truth. However, it includes an unnecessary introductory sentence and bolded process name, violating the strict instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" (implying only the list, no extra text). This format deviation, though minor, warrants a deduction under utmost strictness.
