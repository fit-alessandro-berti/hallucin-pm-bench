8.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)**: The LLM answer accurately identifies all key decision points (eligibility validation, pre-approval, and high-value threshold branch) without introducing undefined activities or artifacts, staying faithful to the process description. The required documents list is nearly identical to the ground truth (GT), including all seven items with appropriate notes on the conditional use of *AuditTrail* and a closing statement excluding extras. Format is clear and organized, with no extraneous content.
  
- **Weaknesses (Deductions for Differences)**: 
  - **Decision Points**: Significant deduction here due to incomplete branching logic and structure mismatch. The LLM summarizes the points narratively but omits explicit outcomes (e.g., no mention of "eligible/not eligible → continue/reject" for triage, or "approved/rejected → payment/end process" for pre-approval/auditor review), which the GT details in a table for precision. The "final payment approval" is not explicitly framed as a combined decision point encompassing *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* and *Senior_Auditor_Review*, reducing completeness. Under strict criteria, this lack of detailed outcomes (even if inferred) represents a core shortfall in summarizing "every decision point," warranting a ~2-point loss.
  - **Overall Fidelity**: Minor formatting differences (narrative vs. table) and phrasing (e.g., LLM's "e.g., whether justified" adds slight interpretive fluff not in GT) contribute to small errors, but documents section is 100% aligned, balancing the score upward.

This strict assessment penalizes the decision points' depth heavily, as they form half the prompt's requirements, but the answer remains substantively strong without major fabrications.
