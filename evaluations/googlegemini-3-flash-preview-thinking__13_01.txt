**9.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Q1 (Perfect match)**: LLM correctly states "1"; minor extra phrasing ("Count of...") is stylistic, no content error. +2.5/2.5
- **Q2 (Near-perfect)**: "5.56%" is exact (proper rounding of 1/18 ≈ 5.555...%); calculation notation differs slightly ("/" and "≈ 0.05555..." vs. "÷" and "$×100$"), no space before "%", but mathematically identical. -0.1. +2.4/2.5
- **Q3 (Good but incomplete phrasing)**: Lists correct "A1002"; however, ground truth explicitly states "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”" for clarity/emphasis. LLM's brevity omits restatement of activity and "only", deviating from fuller ideal. -0.4. +2.1/2.5
- **Q4 (Strong but with deviations)**: Correctly provides exactly two reasons matching allowed categories ("Small sample size" and "Temporal bias"), clearly stated with log-derived details (4 cases, 18 events, ~5-hour window from timestamps 09:00–14:05).
  - Small sample: Captures essence (small N=18/4 cases, single event's outsized influence/high variance), but lacks precise quantification ("±5.56 pp.") and uses "outlier"/"disproportionately influences" vs. "high variance".
  - Temporal: Matches "short time window/single day", adds accurate duration but embellishes with unprompted examples ("day-of-week trends, end-of-month surges, seasonal fluctuations") – plausible general knowledge but risks "unjustified inference" per system rules/ground truth purity (no such patterns in log).
  No hallucinated events, but extras/phrasing differences reduce fidelity. -0.8. +1.7/2.5
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity**: Clear, numbered, log-faithful (no inventions); intro harmless. Minor formatting nitpicks (bolding, approx symbol). Total deductions for phrasing/embellishment reflect strictness on *any* deviation.

**Total: 9.2/10.0** (Excellent adherence; minor strict losses for non-exact matches in phrasing/precision/embellishment prevent perfect score.)
