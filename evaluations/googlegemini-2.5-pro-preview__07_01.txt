• Added tasks  
The LLM answer lists only the id (`id="check_vip"`, `id="generate_qr"`) instead of the full label ("Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code") and id as in the ground truth. The answer omits the task names.

• Removed tasks  
The LLM answer only lists the id of the removed task (`id="send_rma_label"`) and omits the task name.

• Gateway type changes  
Correctly identifies the gateway id and the change, but uses a less polished format compared to the ground truth (does not bold or specify from-to in the same way).

There are no incorrect items, but the lack of task names and the less-detailed formatting constitute minor yet significant loss of precision as required by the instructions ("element names exactly as they appear in the XML" but full names are present in both versions and task names are not shown). This warrants a strict loss of 1 point.
