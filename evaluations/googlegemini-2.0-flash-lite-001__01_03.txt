7.2

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision points:**

- The LLM clearly identifies all decision points:  
  - It describes the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (though this is more an assessment step than a decision point per se).
  - It identifies the conditional branch correctly (risk rating + loan amount) but phrases it less precisely (“Conditional Branch” vs. the explicit name/rule).
  - The TriVote approval is well stated and the rule (2-of-3) is articulated correctly.  
  - *Difference:* The LLM lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a decision point, when it is actually a risk-rating step that immediately precedes the first true decision point. The ground truth is more strictly focused on actual gates/branches, not diagnostics.  
  - *Wording:* The “conditional branch” phrasing lacks the process-specific language (it would be stronger to reflect the precise rule).

**b) Required documents:**

- **Document order:**  
  - Correctly lists Form 14B first.
  - The LLM lumps “Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow” together as one step, whereas ground truth lists them individually. This could cause ambiguity in process audits.
  - “Deck Memo,” “Offer Sheet 77,” “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” “ID Matrix Declaration,” and “Loan Dossier 2025” all are present and in the correct order.
- **Notes:**  
  - The inclusion of “(No document at step …)” is unnecessary but not damaging.
  - No hallucinated documents.

**Penalties:**

- ~0.5 lost for inexact decision-point focus (includes Tri-Color-Risk-Check as if it’s a gate; not explicit on the skip/bypass rule in one sentence, as demanded).
- ~0.5 lost for summarizing the conditional branch a bit less precisely than ground truth wording.
- ~1.0 lost for combining the three scorecards as one entry rather than enumerating them, and for suboptimal clarity compared to the strict, process-auditor level needed.
- ~0.8 for unnecessary step notes, lack of stricter language, and missing some brevity/precision the prompt demands.

**Final score: 7.2**  
The LLM answer is reasonably accurate but misses some strictly required distinctions and precision.
