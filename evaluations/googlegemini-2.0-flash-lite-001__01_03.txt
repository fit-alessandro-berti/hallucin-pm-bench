3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer with utmost strictness against the ground truth, penalizing even small deviations in structure, accuracy, completeness, and fidelity to the prompt. The score reflects significant errors in both parts (a) and (b), including hallucinations of non-decision elements as decisions, extraneous content, and imprecise listing/ordering of documents. Breakdown:

#### Part (a): Decision Points (Major Errors, ~2.0/5.0 Weight)
- **Core Issue - Extraneous "Decision Point"**: The LLM incorrectly identifies "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" as a decision point/gate/branch, describing it as determining the risk rating. This is a factual error and hallucination; it's merely an input step (step 3) that produces an outcome, not a "decision point (gate or conditional branch)" per the prompt. The ground truth correctly identifies only two true decision points: the post-risk conditional skip (after step 3/4) and the TriVote gate (step 6). Including this inflates the count to three, directly contradicting the process description and ground truth—major deduction for inaccuracy and over-invention.
- **Conditional Branch**: Mostly accurate, but phrasing ("less than or equal to €250,000" vs. ground truth's "≤ €250 000") is a minor formatting/precision nit, and it lacks the explicit "otherwise proceeds to review" clause for completeness. Small loss, but strictness amplifies it.
- **TriVote Gate**: Close but imprecise—ground truth specifies "the loan may advance only when at least two of the three approvers ... record 'Approve.'" The LLM's "The loan is approved if at least two ... give their approval" omits the "record 'Approve'" exactitude, simplifies "may advance" to "is approved" (potentially misleading finality), and ignores the process's "requires approvals from all three" setup nuance (resolved by the two-suffice rule). Phrasing differences indicate incomplete fidelity.
- **Structure**: LLM uses bullet points with introductory "Decision Points:" header, while ground truth uses numbered list starting directly with "**a) Decision points**" and concise one-sentence rules. Extra verbiage ("Here's the breakdown...") violates prompt's "one sentence each" directive.
- **Overall**: Fails to "summarise every decision point" exactly; adds non-existent one and dilutes rule precision. This alone warrants a low sub-score.

#### Part (b): Documents List (Major Errors, ~3.5/5.0 Weight)
- **Ordering and Completeness**: The prompt requires listing "**all** documents ... in the order they first appear," implying a clean, sequential enumeration without step references. Ground truth provides exactly nine items in strict first-appearance order: Form 14B (step 1), then the three scorecards individually as separate entries (step 3, in named sequence: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), Deck Memo (step 5), Offer Sheet 77 (unsigned, step 7), Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8), ID Matrix Declaration (step 8, distinct first appearance), and Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9). The LLM errs by:
  - Grouping all three scorecards as one combined entry (#3), collapsing what ground truth treats as three distinct, ordered items (#2-4). This undercounts and disrupts sequence.
  - Merging "Signed Offer Sheet 77" and "ID Matrix Declaration" into a single #8 entry, treating them as co-occurring rather than separate first appearances (Signed is a modified version of Offer Sheet 77, but its signed form debuts in step 8, after the unsigned in #7; ID is wholly new). Ground truth separates them as #7 and #8, preserving granularity.
- **Extraneous Content**: LLM pollutes the list with step-by-step annotations like "(No document at step 2)", "(No document at step 6)", etc., which are unasked for and irrelevant— the prompt demands only the documents, not process gaps or numbering. This adds noise, violating "list all documents ... in the order they first appear" cleanliness. Ground truth is a pure, unadorned list.
- **No Hallucinations**: Correctly avoids inventing absent items (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), but this doesn't offset structural flaws.
- **Structure**: LLM uses numbered list with step ties and a header, diverging from ground truth's direct "**b) Required documents...**" followed by clean 1-9 numbering. Minor formatting diffs (e.g., bolding) compound the messiness.

#### Holistic Assessment
- **Alignment to Prompt**: The LLM response is verbose and interpretive where ground truth is terse and exact. Total decision points mismatch (3 vs. 2) is a critical factual error; document list is incomplete in separation/ordering and cluttered. No part is fully faithful.
- **Strictness Penalty**: Per instructions, small errors (phrasing, grouping) cause "significant loss," and here they compound into major deviations (extra content, wrong count, imprecise rules). No major hallucinations like forbidden docs, but overall fidelity is poor—closer to 1.0-4.0 range, settled at 3.5 for partial accuracy in core rules/list items despite flaws.
- **Final Note**: A perfect score (10.0) requires near-identical structure, count, and wording; this is ~35% accurate at best, hence the low mark.
