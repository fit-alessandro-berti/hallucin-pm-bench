### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) are identified strictly by average waiting time from the table. Both average and 95th-percentile times are quoted verbatim (e.g., 36.5h/120.0h), with no extraneous metrics like service time or throughput mentioned. No other activities discussed. (+10/10)
- **Format and Constraints**: Structured as a crisp memo with subject, greeting, and ranked list; under 150 words (~110). Aligns with "executive memo" intent but adds polite framing (subject/dear COO/closing) absent in ground truth, which is more bare-bones. Minor stylistic deviation but not a violation. (+0.5/1)
- **Actions**: Each is concrete and tied to waiting-time issues, promising ≥20% reduction. However, they are less "data-driven" than ground truth—lacking specifics like "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%," instead using generic phrasing (e.g., "implement... to cut ≥20%"). No unsupported data invented, but falls short of ground truth's evidenced tone, per prompt's "data-driven" requirement. Strict deduction for reduced specificity and evidential backing. (+6/9)

**Overall Rationale**: High fidelity to core requirements and table data, with no major errors or unwarranted content. Deduction primarily for action quality deviating from ground truth's precise, quantified support, reflecting strict scoring on differences.
