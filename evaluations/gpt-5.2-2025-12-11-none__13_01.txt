**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth across all questions under utmost strictness:

- **Q1**: Exact match ("1" / "1 time").
- **Q2**: Exact match (5.56%, with correct calculation shown; minor formatting like "%" vs. "% " is negligible).
- **Q3**: Exact match (A1002 as the sole case).
- **Q4**: Provides two clearly stated reasons directly from the allowed list ("small sample size" with variance emphasis matching high-variance example; "temporal bias/non-representative time window" precisely capturing the single-date limitation). No hallucinations, inferences, or deviations; all derived solely from the 18 log lines.
