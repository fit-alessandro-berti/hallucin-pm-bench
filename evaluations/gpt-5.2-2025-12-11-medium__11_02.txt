### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high score drivers)**: Identical three worst activities correctly selected (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), unambiguously the poorest by key metrics (e.g., wait >150/30/18 min, rework 22%, processing 25/12 min, SLA 12.4%/5.5%/3.2%, throughput drops). Explanations strictly table-based, citing exact figures (e.g., 150 min wait, 22.0% rework, 25 min processing, stdev values, throughput comparisons like 280 vs 270/190). Each has **one concrete, data-driven action** with metric references/targets (e.g., rework 22%→<10%, stdev 9→<5). Concise (169 words <200), executive format, no hallucinations or extraneous activities.
- **Differences/Deductions (-0.8 total, strict per instructions)**: 
  - Phrasing/structure not identical (e.g., LLM's "Worst overall delay" vs GT's "performance hotspots"; numbered bold subheads vs GT's inline **bold** metrics; no GT-style intro/closing projection of 10% throughput lift/40% SLA reduction).
  - Minor metric omissions in explanations: LLM skips Review_Documents' 30-min wait (GT highlights) and Initial_Assessment's 12-min processing (GT notes); emphasizes stdev more (valid but shifts focus slightly).
  - Recommendations valid/data-tied but diverge substantively (LLM: operational checklists/staffing/triage with numerical targets; GT: digital/AI/triage with broader impact projection)—not identical ideas, reducing match.
No rule violations; excellent overall fidelity, but strict diff-matching yields minor penalty.
