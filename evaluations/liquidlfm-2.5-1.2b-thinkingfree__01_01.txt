**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major deficiencies, ~40% alignment)**: LLM identifies 3 points but with vague, inaccurate descriptions lacking explicit branching logic/outcomes (e.g., no "Eligible/Not eligible → reject" for #1; #2 incorrectly frames post-approval rather than during/after PreApprove; #3 conflates branch with decision without ≤€1,000 path or rejection). Ground truth precisely locates decisions (during Triage, after PreApprove, at PreApprove/Senior), includes rejections/end states. No table/structure match; misses "final payment approval" nuance from constraints.
- **Required Documents (significant omissions/errors, ~30% alignment)**: Lists only 5/7 (misses **RefundRequestForm** entirely—core step 1; includes **RefundConfirmationPDF** but misspells as "RefundConfirmation_Pdf", falsely claims "not mentioned in steps, implied"—directly contradicted by step 6). Groups items without full catalogue; omits note on AuditTrail's conditional status matching ground truth.
- **Other strict penalties**: Extra unauthorized "(Note: Adjustments...)" introduces meta-content violating "Do not introduce..."; loose phrasing (e.g., "exceeds €1,000" vs exact "> €1 000"); no exhaustive/complete fidelity to process/constraints. Small errors (typos, implications) compound to major gaps per instructions. Overall ~35% match justifies low score.
