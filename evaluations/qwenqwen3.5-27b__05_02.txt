The LLM answer fails catastrophically on the core objective of *fixing SLA breaches*: it loosens the dueDate from P5D to P7D (worsening compliance), directly opposite the ground truth's tightening to P2D; the rationale inverts the goal (accommodating breaches vs. resolving them to meet a 3-day SLA); the diff format deviates with unnecessary file headers, full context lines, and incorrect line numbers, violating "single hunk" minimalism; zero alignment with ground truth.
