The LLM answer is mostly correct in terms of factual content and complies with the headings and instructions. However, it should be penalized for not including the task names and ids together, as required by the prompt and clearly shown in the ground truth. It only lists the ids, omitting the human-readable task names. Similarly, for the removed task, it lists only the id, not the name. The gateway type change is expressed in a compact way using the id and types, which is acceptable but could be improved by following the explicit phrasing of the ground truth.

Thus, the main loss of points (-2) comes from incomplete labeling/clarity rather than structural or factual mistakes.
