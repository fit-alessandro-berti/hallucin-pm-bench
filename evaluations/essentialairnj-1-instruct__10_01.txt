**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric):
- **Vocabulary (partial credit, +2.0)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Matches 4/6 activity names precisely.
- **Format (-4.0)**: Not a RACI matrix (rows=activities, columns=roles). Instead, inverted dict (activities→role lists/tuples); broken/malformed print (e.g., "Res(() -> {roles}"); code + extraneous notes, not a table.
- **RACI Completeness (-2.0)**: No R/A/C/I designations at all. Only partial/incomplete role lists per activity; omits full cross-role assignments (e.g., no C/I for non-primaries).
- **Correctness of Allocations (-1.0)**: Wrong/inaccurate (e.g., "Receive Application" wrongly adds "FC"; no **R/A** for AM where narrative fits; ignores inferred C/I across roles).
- **Unwarranted Content (-1.0)**: Extra code snippets, notes, "functional program" claims, alternative dict—violates "no extra tasks/roles/columns."
- **Total**: Major structural/functional failures outweigh vocab; not remotely equivalent to ground truth table.
