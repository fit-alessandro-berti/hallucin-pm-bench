### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: 
  - Correctly identifies **exactly 2 decision points**, matching ground truth.
  - **Part (a)** rules are semantically identical and concise (one sentence each), with precise matching of conditionals (Low/Medium risk **AND** ≤ €250k skip; any 2/3 approvals pass). No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML/credit-bureau).
  - **Part (b)** lists **exactly the same 9 documents in correct first-appearance order**, treating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as distinct (as process explicitly lists it separately in Step 8).
  - Complete, accurate, no omissions.

- **Differences/Deductions (strict penalties for non-identical phrasing, extras, format)**:
  - **Part (a)**: Phrasing is paraphrase, not verbatim (e.g., LLM adds "Tri-Color-Risk-Check yields", "application must proceed", "each cast an approve-or-reject vote" – process says "approvals", not explicit "reject vote" or "cast vote"; ground truth uses "record 'Approve'"). Names decision points differently (e.g., "Step 4 — Risk / Amount Conditional Branch" vs. "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"). Extra sentence "No other conditional logic...". (-0.4)
  - **Part (b)**: Extra "First appears at" column and explanatory note on "Signed" (accurate but not in ground truth, adding unrequested detail). (-0.2)
  - **Overall**: Fancy tables/headers ("# Acme Bank...", "---") deviate from ground truth's plain numbered lists; minor bolding/emphasis differences. No functional errors, but strict "differences = lower grade" and "small errors significant loss" applied proportionally. 

Perfect match would be 10.0; these are small but visible divergences (-0.8 total).
