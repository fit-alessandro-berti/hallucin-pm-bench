The LLM answer accurately identifies all correct changes: three added tasks with precise names and IDs, one removed task with precise name and ID, and the single gateway type change (exclusive to inclusive) with the correct ID. Content is factually perfect and complete, matching the ground truth semantically. Minor deductions for: (1) inclusion of the gateway's new name ("Eligibility Check"), which violates "ignore cosmetic renamings" by referencing it under a non-renaming category (-0.3); (2) less precise gateway phrasing omitting "(XOR)" / "(OR)" and explicit v1/v2 versioning (-0.2); (3) formatting variances (bullets vs. numbered lists, "(ID: )" vs. backticks with bolding, no final completeness note) (-0.3). Utmost strictness applied, but high score reflects near-exact match.
