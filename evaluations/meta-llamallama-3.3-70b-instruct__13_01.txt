9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match ("1"). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Calculation and value correct, but final summary omits the "%" symbol (ground truth explicitly includes it as "5.56 %"). Minor formatting error, but strict criteria warrant a -0.4 deduction.
- **Question 3**: Concise list matches ("A1002"), but ground truth provides fuller phrasing ("Only case A1002 contains..."). Slight deviation in completeness; -0.2 deduction.
- **Question 4**: Both reasons are valid and align closely with ground truth options ("Insufficient Sample Size" ≈ "Small sample size"; "Lack of Representative Period" ≈ "Temporal bias"). Stated clearly, but lacks the detailed explanatory examples in ground truth (e.g., variance calculation or specific time window). Brevity reduces depth; -0.2 deduction.
- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: No hallucinations or inferences beyond log data. Step-by-step reasoning is extraneous but harmless. Total deductions reflect strictness on precision and completeness.
