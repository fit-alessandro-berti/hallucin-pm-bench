7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all structural changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the gateway type change) without introducing inaccuracies or extraneous details, adhering to the instruction to ignore cosmetic renamings (e.g., name changes to "Auto-Approve Loan" or "Eligibility Check"). It uses the exact required headings and bullet-style grouping, matching the prompt's structure.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Added tasks**: Accurate names, but lacks numbering (1., 2., 3.), bold formatting, and precise task IDs (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity`), which are essential for meticulous identification in BPMN XML analysis. This incompleteness deducts ~2 points.
- **Removed tasks**: Accurate name, but lacks numbering, bold formatting, and task ID (`Task_RejectLoan`). Similar incompleteness deducts ~1.5 points.
- **Gateway-type changes**: Correctly notes the ID and type shift (Exclusive → Inclusive), but omits explanatory details (e.g., "exclusive (XOR)" and "inclusive (OR)"), version references (*v1* to *v2*), numbering, and bold formatting. It also misses the confirmatory note about no other changes. This reduces precision and completeness, deducting ~2 points.

Overall, the core content aligns ~75-80% with the ground truth, but the absence of IDs, explanations, and formatting details (small but significant omissions in a "meticulous" analysis) prevents a higher score. No credit lost for correctness, but strict deduction for fidelity to the detailed ground truth format and specificity.
