9.8

- The LLM answer is virtually identical to the ground truth, providing the same substantive information in slightly different (but clear and correct) wording.
- The only *extremely minor* departure is the ordering and omission of colon formatting for the case names, but all factual content is correct and concisely presented.
- Due to request for "utmost strictness" in grading, a nearly perfect but not absolutely format-identical answer earns a 9.8 rather than a 10.0.
