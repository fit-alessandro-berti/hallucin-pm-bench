The LLM answer precisely aligns with the ground truth in conclusion (impossibility of computation due to missing temporal data) and reasoning (lack of timestamps/durations in the redacted log). Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "cannot be calculated" vs. "cannot be computed"; explicit mention of "duration column") do not introduce errors or deviations, maintaining strict adherence to the system policy and prompt requirements.
