9.2

The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in stating impossibility due to redacted data (headers only, no rows/timestamps), specifying the exact columns needed (start_time/complete_time), and focusing on "Approve Invoice". It fulfills the "one short paragraph" by providing a precise explanation without guessing. Minor deductions for: (1) splitting into two sentences/paragraphs instead of one integrated block; (2) not explicitly naming "Artefact A"; (3) unnecessary mention of `case_id`/`activity` (already inferable from headers); (4) "average duration" vs. exact "cycle time"; (5) lacking "dispersion" phrasing or "additional raw log entries" suggestion; (6) straight quotes vs. curly. These small phrasing/structural differences warrant a strict but not drastic reduction from 10.0.
