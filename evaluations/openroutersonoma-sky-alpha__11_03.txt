### Evaluation Rationale
- **Identification of Activities (jointly on SLA breaches and waiting time)**: Matches ground truth exactly (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment as the three worst). No loss here.
- **Quantification of SLA Exceedance**: Nearly identical (+300s for Legal, +300s for Risk, +60s for Credit), with waiting times correctly stated (600s, 480s, 200s). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., LLM uses paragraphs vs. ground truth's bold lines), but core data aligns—8/10.
- **Structure and Formatting**: Significant deviations. LLM includes a title, formal To/From/Date (with invented "[Current Date]"), introductory/total cases reference (1200 vs. ground truth's invented "4805"), and a closing sentence; uses paragraphs for analysis. Ground truth is more concise with Subject line (invented date/sample), bold activity summaries, and bullets under "Recommended actions." Prompt requires "only the memo text" and "bullet points only for recommendations"—LLM adds extras and mixes formats. Major deduction—3/10.
- **Recommendations**: Completely different content, violating closeness to ground truth. LLM's are somewhat data-driven (ties to waiting times/cases) but generic ("allocate resources," "streamline manual checks," "automate initial scoring") with one critical calculation error (Risk Review waiting as "60% of 600-second throughput"—actual 480/600=80%, inventing wrong metric). Ground truth's are more specific ("rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k") but invent non-table elements (e.g., "low-risk files," "peak morning window," "€25k"). Despite prompt's no-invent rule, differences in wording/actions are total—each bullet mismatches entirely. Severe loss—2/10.
- **Overall Adherence to Prompt (word count ≈150, data-grounded, no inventions/absent metrics)**: LLM is 148 words, sticks to table data (e.g., correct cases per activity, no projections like ground truth's "35% reduction"), but calc error and structure bloat introduce issues. Ground truth invents (total cases, date, loan details, projection), but evaluation prioritizes textual/content differences. Strictness applied: even small calc error and phrasing variances cause outsized deductions per instructions. Total weighted score reflects high divergence in key sections (recommendations/structure).
