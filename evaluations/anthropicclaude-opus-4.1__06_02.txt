The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names, adhering to the core requirements of enumeration and comma separation. However, it includes an unrequested introductory sentence, which deviates from the strict format of "returning the answer as numbered lines" without additional text, warranting a deduction for non-compliance with output structure. Minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., single vs. double spaces after commas) further reduce perfection under strict evaluation.
