**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correctness (full marks here: +3.0)**: Accurately answers "Yes" with a valid minimal firing sequence (T1→T2→T5) proving T5 fires before T3. Correctly describes markings, inhibitor arc semantics (p4=0 required, satisfied since T3 not fired), and enabling rule. No factual errors or invalid claims.
- **Completeness vs. Ground Truth (-0.5)**: Provides required "one concrete firing sequence" and brief justification, but omits Ground Truth's extension (T3→T4 afterward, showing post-T5 behavior and permanent disablement). Misses explicit full proof that T5 is *only* possible before T3 (e.g., "p4 never emptied except together with p3 by T4"), though implies it.
- **Precision/Wording (-0.2)**: Does not capture Ground Truth's stronger phrasing ("T5 can, and indeed *must*, fire before T3 if it is ever to occur"), settling for "it is possible" + implication. Minor phrasing diff: "T5 can only fire if T3 has not yet fired" vs. Ground Truth's detailed inhibitor permanence.
- **Presentation/Format (-0.1)**: More verbose/detailed markings (good, but deviates from Ground Truth's concise inline style). Uses formal $M_i$ notation (accurate but not matching Ground Truth shorthand). Bolded sections similar but not identical.
- **Strictness adjustment**: No major errors, but stylistic/content differences (shorter proof, no full sequence, weaker "must" claim) deduct under "utmost strictness" and "differences lower grade"/"small errors significant loss." Still very close (92% match in substance).
