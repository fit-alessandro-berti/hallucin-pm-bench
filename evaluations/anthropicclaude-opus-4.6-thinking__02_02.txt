**9.5**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all questions (correct count of 3 cases, exact sequence for C002, correct distinct predecessors "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" in alphabetical order with no missing/extra activities). No fabrications or errors in content/line-by-line precision when mapped to ground truth:

- **Q1/A1**: Matches **3** exactly (minor deduction for unasked case listing, treated as small extra).
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match (underscores rendered equivalently; minor deduction for unasked extraction explanation/lines).
- **Q3/A3**: Exact list content, alphabetically ordered, one-per-line structure (minor deductions for extra explanatory table, numbering instead of bullets, and bolding vs. plain).

Strict grading deducts 0.5 total for format deviations and extras (no hallucinations, as all added details are verifiably correct from log), but retains near-perfect score for precise adherence to query facts.
