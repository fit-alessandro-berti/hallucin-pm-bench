The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly identifying the impossibility of computation due to the redacted event log (no rows or timestamps available), explicitly covering the inability to calculate average cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval, and providing a precise, concise explanation without guessing or using external knowledge. Minor deductions for slightly longer phrasing, a conversational tone ("Okay, let's analyze"), and brief mention of the irrelevant SLA metric (from Artefact B), which the ground truth omits for stricter focus on the data absenceâ€”though correctly dismissed, this adds extraneous detail.
