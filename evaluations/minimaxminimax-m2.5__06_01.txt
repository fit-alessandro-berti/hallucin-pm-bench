9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can run in parallel (matching the ground truth content and rationale), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format with one pair per line. No extra or missing pairs.

Minor deduction for imperfect whitespace matching: the second pair lacks the extra leading spaces ("     ") present in the ground truth for column alignment ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines" vs. LLM's "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines"). Under utmost strictness, this small formatting discrepancy warrants a 1.0-point loss from perfection, despite being arguably insignificant for intent. No other differences (e.g., no markdown wrapper required, names exact).
