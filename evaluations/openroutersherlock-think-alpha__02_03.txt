The LLM answer is fully correct, concise, and aligns with the prompt's instructions for bullet-point format. Minor formatting differences (e.g., "1:" vs. "**A1:**", omission of case list in Q1 which was not required by the question, and unescaped underscore in Q2) do not constitute errors, as the core content matches the ground truth exactly.
