The LLM answer correctly identifies all changes with precise task IDs and names, matching the ground truth content exactly (added: Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject; removed: Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan; gateway: exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision). No extraneous changes reported, adhering to instructions (ignores renamings like "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name change).

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for:
- Stylistic/format differences: Bullets (•) vs. numbered lists (1., 2., 3.); ID-first ("Task_ID (name)") vs. name-first bold + ID-backticks; simpler gateway phrasing ("Exclusive → Inclusive") vs. detailed ("exclusive (XOR) in *v1* to inclusive (OR) in *v2*"); gateway heading retains "(e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)" while ground truth omits it.
- No final confirmatory note.

Semantically flawless; format variances are small but deduct per strictness directive.
