The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks: Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer; removed: Task_ManualReview; gateways: both changed from exclusive to parallel), with headings verbatim and in order, no extras or commentary. Deductions for format mismatches vs. ground truth: (1) missing "-" bullets on all 6 list items (-1.0); (2) gateway changes include extraneous guillemets « » (not in prompt example or ground truth) and lack space after ":" (-1.0). Content perfect under strict semantic evaluation, but formatting differences penalized per instructions.
