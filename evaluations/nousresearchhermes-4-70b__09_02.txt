9.5

The LLM answer is accurate and correctly explains that, given only occurrence counts and no timestamps or duration data, the average cycle time cannot be determined. The phrasing is slightly less precise than the ground truth: it uses "circulatory times" (likely intending "cycle times") and could more directly specify "start-to-completion intervals" are missing. Nonetheless, it fully covers the reason for impossibility. I deduct only 0.5 points for minor imprecision in terminology and less explicit mention of “start-to-completion intervals.”
