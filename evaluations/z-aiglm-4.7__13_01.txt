**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1 (weight ~25%)**: LLM says "**1**"; GT: "`1` occurrence". Minor omission of "occurrence" deducts 0.2 (brevity, not exact match).
- **Q2 (weight ~25%)**: "**5.56%** (Calculation: 1 occurrence ÷ 18 total events = 0.0555...)" vs. "`5.56 %` (calculation: $1 ÷ 18 × 100 = 5.56$ %)". Precise value matches; minor diffs in spacing (no space before %), notation ("occurrence" extra, ellipsis imprecise), deduct 0.3.
- **Q3 (weight ~25%)**: "**A1002**" vs. "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”." Correct ID listed, but omits "only case" qualifier and activity reference for clarity/emphasis; too brief, deducts 0.5.
- **Q4 (weight ~25%)**: Two valid reasons ("Small sample size" with 18 events/4 cases detail; "Limited time window" as single day/morning snapshot) match GT's "Small sample size" and "Temporal bias" closely. Good extrapolation reasoning without hallucination. Minor issues: no variance quantification (±5.56 pp example), "one morning" slightly imprecise (log spans ~09:00-14:05, not purely morning), extra inferences (seasonal/weekly patterns borderline but data-tied). Deducts 0.3.

**Overall**: Extremely close (no hallucinations, data-faithful), but strict penalties for phrasing brevity, minor formatting/precision slips total -1.3 from 10.0 → **9.2**.
