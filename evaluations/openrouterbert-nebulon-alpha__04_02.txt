**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Statuses**: 4/6 correct (R3, R4, R5, R6 match). R1 wrong (Violated vs. Compliant). R2 wrong (Compliant vs. Violated). Major errors in core compliance judgments.
- **Justifications**: R1 & R2 fully mismatched/wrong reasoning (misinterprets approval sequence, ignores post-change approval for R2 timing). R5 minor diff (omits Pay_Invoice) but acceptable. Others match closely (all ≤20 words).
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT), but driven by incorrect violation set (LLM: R1/R3/R5 vs. GT: R2/R3/R5).
- **Format**: Matches prompt (bold status + short justification per rule + all-caps overall).
- **Strictness adjustment**: Two critical rule errors (wrong status + justification) warrant heavy deduction (~ -7 points from 10); minor R5 diff adds slight loss. Not negligible.
