5.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The LLM answer includes an extra task ("checks warranty eligibility") and associated sequence flows not present in the ground truth. The ground truth models the warranty eligibility check implicitly via the exclusive gateway for the warranty decision (as per the prompt's specification for step 3). Adding a separate task constitutes inventing beyond explicitly stated flow elements, violating the prompt's rule against inventing elements. This alters the process flow semantics and adds unrequired elements (1 extra task + 2 extra flows). Ground truth has exactly the minimal required structure without this.
- **Name Matching (Moderate Deduction: -1.0 points)**: Task and event names must match the prompt text verbatim. LLM deviates in several places: parallel tasks include extra descriptive phrases (e.g., "Create shipment order for the replacement unit" vs. ground truth's "Create shipment order", which aligns with bolded verbatim text); start event adds "submitted" and uses lowercase inconsistent with ground truth's capitalization; minor casing variations across tasks (e.g., "validates the claim" vs. "Validate the claim"). Ground truth is closer to normalized title case for consistency, though neither is perfect. Small errors, but strictness requires significant loss.
- **Extra Content (Minor Deduction: -0.0 additional, balanced by completeness)**: The full BPMNDiagram section (shapes, edges, layout) is extra compared to the minimal ground truth (process only). This is a difference but semantically neutral/positive for a "diagram" output; no further deduction as it doesn't hallucinate process elements.
- **Other Differences (Minor: IDs, conditions, attributes)**: IDs prefixed correctly but differ in format (e.g., "wrc_task_validate" vs. "wrc_validate"); conditions use expressions instead of flow names; attributes like isExecutable ("true" vs. "false") and extra xmlns differ slightly. These are small (e.g., whitespace-equivalent variations allowed full credit), no additional deduction.
- **Strengths (Supporting 5.0 Baseline)**: Core structure (start event, 2 exclusive gateways, parallel gateway pair, 2 end events, loop for re-validation, parallel activities, rejection/success paths) is semantically close. All required elements from ground truth are present, with no omissions. Exactly two end events and correct ID prefixing.

Overall, the LLM answer is ~50% aligned semantically (core flow matches but with invention), warranting a midpoint score under strict rubric. Full credit (10.0) requires near-identical equivalence; this has clear extras and mismatches.
