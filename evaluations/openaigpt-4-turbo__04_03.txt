9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses all rules (violation only on Rule 3), with justifications that reference each rule and align closely with the ground truth on facts, sequence analysis, and conclusion. Minor deductions for: (1) incomplete Rule 1 justification (omits explicit "once each" despite quoting the full rule, unlike ground truth's "QE appears once"); (2) prose/numbered format vs. ground truth table (less structured); (3) slightly wordier phrasing without symbols (✔/❌). Under utmost strictness, these small completeness/format differences warrant a 1.0-point loss from perfect.
