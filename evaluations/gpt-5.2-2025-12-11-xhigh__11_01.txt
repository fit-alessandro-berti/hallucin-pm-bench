**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 ranked correctly by avg waiting time (Request_Documents #1: 36.5/120.0; Send_Closure_Letter #2: 12.2/44.0; Assess_Liability #3: 7.8/16.4). +10/10.
- **No unwarranted content**: Major violation (-3.0). Explicitly mentions other activities (Initial_Screening, Approve_Payment, Reject_Claim), contravening scoring notes ("no other activities... appear") and ground truth's "mention **only** these three activities." No service/throughput mentioned: OK.
- **Action relevance**: Logically tied to waiting times, concrete, each promises ≥20% cut via explicit targets (e.g., 36.5→≤29.2h). Data-driven via calculations from table avgs. However, differs entirely from ground truth actions (no pilots/estimates/e-signatures/bypass rules) and ties two actions to other activities, reducing purity. -1.0.
- **Format/conciseness**: Crisp memo-like (<150 words), but extras (To:/Subject/bolding) diverge from ground truth's bare list. Minor phrasing diffs (e.g., "95th" vs "p95", "h" spacing). -0.5 (strictness on small diffs).
- **Overall differences**: Significant content divergence in actions + unwarranted refs outweigh perfect facts. Strict penalty applied.
