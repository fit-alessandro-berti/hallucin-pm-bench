**4.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Semantic equivalence (major deduction -2.0)**: Not equivalent. LLM adds an extra task (`wrc_checkEligibility "checks warranty eligibility"`) and sequence flow (`wrc_SequenceFlow_6`), altering the flow (complete GW → check task → eligibility GW vs. ground truth's direct complete GW → warranty GW). Rubric explicitly deducts for "extra/hallucinated tasks, gateways, or flows". Although prompt mentions "checks warranty eligibility", ground truth omits it (treating GW as decision), making this a structural difference.
- **XML validity/syntax (major deduction -1.5)**: Invalid BPMN 2.0 XML. Uses `xsi:type="tFormalExpression"` in `<conditionExpression>` without declaring `xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"`. Undeclared namespace prefix breaks XML parsing. Ground truth avoids this by using `name` attributes on flows.
- **Unnecessary additions (deduction -1.0)**: Massive `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` section (~250 lines of shapes/edges/waypoints) not in minimal ground truth (34 lines, no DI). Prompt requests "self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document" but ground truth is model-only; extra DI bloats and differs.
- **Invented content (deduction -1.0)**: Condition expressions invent unstated texts (e.g., `<![CDATA[claim is incomplete]]>`, `[product is out of warranty]`). Prompt forbids inventing beyond stated; ground truth uses neutral `name="No"/"Yes"`.
- **Minor name/ID/namespace diffs (-0.5 cumulative)**: Different element names (e.g., start `"online warranty claim"` vs. `"Online warranty claim submitted"`; GW names like `"claim completeness check"` vs. `"Claim complete?"`), process ID (`wrc_WarrantyReplacement` vs. `wrc_process`), namespaces (default vs. `bpmn:` prefix), sequenceFlow naming (`wrc_SequenceFlow_N` vs. `wrc_sfN`), 16 flows vs. 15. IDs prefixed correctly, but all differ.
- **Strengths (no added points per strictness)**: Task names match prompt **verbatim** (e.g., `"validates the claim"`, `"send rejection notice"` lowercase; outperforms ground truth's capitalizations). Exactly required gateways (completeness exclusive, warranty exclusive, parallel split/join), 2 ends, loop, parallel correctly modeled. No omissions.

Total differences too numerous/significant for high score under "utmost strictness"; small errors (e.g., invented conditions, ns) cause outsized loss. Semantically ~80% aligned but structurally divergent.
