The LLM answer accurately explains why it is impossible to compute the required metrics given the absence of any actual event log data (all rows and timestamps redacted) and does not attempt to guess based on external information. It demonstrates awareness of the required data for such computations and explicitly cites their absence.

However, the LLM answer loses points for the following reasons:
- It is somewhat verbose and could be more concise. The ground truth answer is much more direct and succinct, while the LLM reiterates similar points multiple times. 
- The LLM spends unnecessary words discussing Artefact Bâ€™s 7.8-day metric, which, although correct to mention as irrelevant, slightly distracts from the direct answer.
- The request was to respond in plain text with no tables; while the LLM answer itself does not include tables, its structure and slight rambling deviate from the most direct style.

In summary: The answer is factually correct and does not introduce extraneous information, but minor lapses in brevity, focus, and precision warrant a significant point deduction per the strict grading request.
