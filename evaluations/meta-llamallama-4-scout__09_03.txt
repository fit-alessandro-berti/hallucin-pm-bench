The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of computation due to redacted data and provides a precise reason tied to the absence of timestamps and event details, aligning with the ground truth's core explanation. However, it deducts points for unnecessary verbosity (multiple paragraphs instead of one short one), extraneous details (e.g., defining cycle time calculation and referencing historical SLA data, which borders on outside elaboration), and lack of conciseness, violating the instruction's format strictness. No guessing occurs, but the response structure is not optimal.
