The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate claim), structure (short justification per case), and evidence (correctly identifies reversed ordering in Cases 1001 and 1003, absence in Case 1002, and intervening activity in Case 1003 to address "immediately"). Citations use timestamps instead of line numbers, a minor stylistic deviation without factual error, but strict evaluation deducts slightly for not mirroring the ground truth's explicit conclusion on "immediately precede" across cases. No substantive errors or omissions.
