### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- The ground truth identifies exactly **two** decision points: (1) the risk-based conditional skip in step 4, and (2) the TriVote gate in step 6.
- The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two main decision points (the conditional skip and TriVote) in accurate sentences, aligning closely with the ground truth rules (e.g., "Low or Medium and ≤ €250,000" for the skip; "at least two approvals out of three" for TriVote).
- However, the LLM incorrectly adds a **third** decision point ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome"), which is not a gate or conditional branch—it is merely an input step (step 3) that produces a risk rating. The actual decision is the subsequent conditional in step 4. This is a hallucinated/inaccurate expansion, introducing an extraneous element not present in the process or ground truth.
- Strict deduction for the extra, incorrect point (reduces completeness and precision by ~30-40% of the section, as it inflates the count and mischaracterizes the process).

#### Part (b): Documents
- The ground truth lists **nine** documents in first-appearance order, explicitly separating "Offer Sheet 77" (step 7) from "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (step 8), and including "ID Matrix Declaration" (also step 8) after the signed version.
- The LLM correctly lists the first seven core documents (Form 14B through Deck Memo, then Offer Sheet 77) in order, and includes Loan Dossier 2025 at the end.
- Major errors: (1) Completely omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77," which is a distinct document explicitly required in step 8 (this is a significant omission, as the process differentiates the unsigned preparation in step 7 from the signed version in step 8). (2) Places "ID Matrix Declaration" immediately after "Offer Sheet 77" (as item 7), implying it first appears before or separately from the signed sheet, but step 8 introduces both together—ground truth orders Signed before ID for precision. (3) Results in only eight items instead of nine, undercounting required documents.
- No hallucinations (e.g., no invalid KYC/AML mentions), but the missing document and ordering imprecision are not minor—these directly contradict the process description's explicit document sequencing in step 8.
- Strict deduction for incompleteness and order error (reduces accuracy by ~40% of the section).

#### Overall
- Strengths: Concise structure, no external fabrications, core rules captured.
- Weaknesses: Extraneous content in (a), critical omission and sequencing issue in (b)—these are not "small errors" but substantive deviations from the ground truth, warranting a mid-low score under utmost strictness. The answer is functional but flawed enough to mislead on key process elements.
