7.0

**Assessment:**

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM answer correctly identifies both main decision points:  
  1. The conditional branch after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (whether to skip underwriting review or not, based on risk and amount).  
  2. The TriVote approval gate (requiring two of three approvals).
- The answer includes a little superfluous phrasing: (“which governs whether Manual-Underwriting-Review is triggered” is a bit indirect and could be clearer).
- It introduces the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a "decision" on its own, which is only indirectly the gate (the gate is the *conditional branch* after the risk check, per prompt). This is a minor extraneous detail but does not actually hallucinate an extra step.
- Both rules are described, but the first one is split into two bullets, which is more verbose than needed but not factually wrong.

**b) Documents**

- The answer lists all the required documents and puts them in the correct order **up to Offer Sheet 77**.
- However, it omits **Signed Offer Sheet 77** as a separate document (ground truth requires “Signed Offer Sheet 77” as its own explicit item). Instead, it merges the creation and signing of Offer Sheet 77 into one step and doesn't enumerate the signature as its own document.
- The rest of the document order is correct, and all other documents are listed, with accurate notes.
- The note regarding KYC/AML is proper and not hallucinated.

**Scoring rationale:**

- Small but clear error: Missing “Signed Offer Sheet 77” as a separate document (this is significant given the instructions to be strict).
- Minor redundancy in splitting the first decision point.
- No hallucinations or major factual errors.
- Given the need for strict evaluation, a 3-point deduction is warranted for the document list error and a slight additional penalty for imperfect framing of the decision points.

**Final Score:** 7.0
