7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer against the ground truth with strict adherence to the prompt's requirements, penalizing deviations in structure, completeness, accuracy, and fidelity to the process description. The score reflects high overall alignment in content and phrasing but deducts significantly for identifiable errors, as even minor inaccuracies (e.g., over- or under-listing) must impact the grade substantially.

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- **Strengths**: The LLM correctly identifies the two core decision points from the ground truth (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate). Descriptions are concise (one sentence each), accurately capture the rules (e.g., "Low or Medium" risk + amount threshold for skipping step 5; "at least two approvals" for TriVote, matching the process's "any two ... suffice"), and reference the relevant roles/inputs without hallucination.
- **Errors/Differences** (significant deductions):
  - The LLM introduces a third decision point ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome"), treating the risk-check step itself as a "decision point" that "governs" the skip. This is incorrect: the ground truth (and process) treats the risk check as an input-generating step, not a standalone gate or branch—the actual conditional branch is the post-check skip (ground truth's single item 1). This splits and inflates the count from 2 to 3, adding extraneous detail about scorecards that belongs in the process description, not as a decision rule.
  - Phrasing variances (e.g., LLM's "governs whether ... is triggered" vs. ground truth's explicit "bypasses ... otherwise it proceeds") are minor but still deviate, as the ground truth emphasizes the binary branch outcome.
- **Impact**: This structural error (extra item + misclassification) reduces accuracy by ~25%, as it doesn't perfectly mirror the ground truth's two-point summary.

#### Part (b): Documents
- **Strengths**: The order of first appearance is correct for 8 of the 9 items (Form 14B → scorecards → Deck Memo → Offer Sheet 77 → ID Matrix Declaration → Loan Dossier 2025). The LLM appropriately lists the three scorecards separately (as inputs in step 3) and excludes KYC/AML (with an explicit note, aligning with the process and ground truth's anti-hallucination reminder). Explanatory notes on steps/usage are helpful but not required, so neutral.
- **Errors/Differences** (significant deductions):
  - Missing "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct item (ground truth's #7). The process explicitly lists "Signed Offer Sheet 77" in step 8, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7. The LLM combines them into one entry (#6), noting the signing but not treating the signed version as a required document in its own right. This undercounts the total (8 vs. 9 items) and disrupts completeness/first-appearance sequencing.
  - The scorecards are listed with em-dashes (Scorecard–Cyan), matching the process/ground truth formatting.
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/credit-bureau mentions).
- **Impact**: Omitting a explicitly named document is a clear completeness error, warranting ~20% deduction, as the list must include *all* required documents without merging.

#### Overall
- The answer is comprehensive, faithful to the process, and free of major fabrications, earning baseline credit for correctness in rules/details.
- Total deductions: ~2.5 points for part (a)'s extraneous point and phrasing (~1.25); ~2.0 points for part (b)'s missing item (~1.0) and minor extras (~1.0). Strictness amplifies these as "small" but pivotal mismatches to the ground truth's exact structure/counts.
- No other issues (e.g., the LLM's note on KYC exclusion reinforces accuracy without contradicting). If stricter on added explanations, score could drop to 7.0, but they don't contradict.
