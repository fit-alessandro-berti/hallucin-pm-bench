**4.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
The LLM answer is semantically close but has **critical deviations** from both the prompt requirements and ground truth, warranting major deductions under utmost strictness (small errors like non-verbatim names = significant loss; omissions of explicit elements = heavy loss). Key issues:

#### Major Omissions / Structural Errors (-4.0 points total):
- **Missing "send rejection notice" task** (explicitly required activity in prompt step 3, bolded; GT models as `wrc_reject` task → end). LLM incorrectly merges into `wrc_end_reject` name ("Send rejection notice and end"), altering semantics—no task performs the activity before ending. This omits a required flow element and violates "model **only** the flow elements explicitly mentioned."
- No task for "**checks warranty eligibility**" (explicit bolded activity in step 3; GT also omits, but still a prompt violation both share—compounded by reject omission).

#### Non-Verbatim Task Names (-1.5 points):
- `wrc_validate_claim`: "Service agent validates the claim" ≠ verbatim "**validates the claim**" (extra "Service agent"; GT closer with "Validate the claim").
- `wrc_request_missing`: "Agent requests missing information" ≠ verbatim "**requests missing information**" (extra "Agent").
- All tasks use gerund + extras/caps; prompt demands **verbatim** match to bolded text (e.g., lowercase "validates"/"requests"; GT adjusts tense but omits subjects, closer).
- `wrc_schedule_courier`: "Schedule courier pickup" omits "of the faulty product" (verbatim "**Schedule courier pickup** of the faulty product"; GT same flaw).

#### Minor / Extra Elements (-0.5 points):
- `userTask` vs GT/prompt-implied `task` (unnecessary actor assumption).
- Explicit `<conditionExpression>true/false</conditionExpression>` only on warranty flows (incomplete; GT uses flow `name="Yes"/"No"` consistently).
- Extraneous: process `name`, exporter attrs, verbose xmlns/targetNamespace, gw names ("Is claim complete?", "Parallel split"), start/end names diverge (e.g., success "End" vs GT "Successful end").
- Fewer flows (14 vs GT 15) due to missing reject task/flow.

#### Positives (partial credit):
- Correct overall structure: start → validate → complete exGW (loop) → warranty exGW → parallel split/join → update → close → success end.
- All IDs prefixed "wrc_".
- Exactly 2 end events.
- No invented extras (e.g., no escalations/errors).
- Valid BPMN 2.0 XML, semantically ~80% equivalent.

Base 10.0 → deductions = **4.0**. Not full credit despite note on "semantically equivalent" (e.g., IDs/whitespace)—structural omission/non-verbatim violate prompt explicitly, not excused. Identical to GT would be 10.0; this has too many diffs.
