**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth: both provide a single concise sentence correctly explaining the impossibility due to absent timestamps (with the LLM precisely referencing the explicit statement in the artifacts), use equivalent phrasing for the core reasoning (lack of timestamps preventing duration measurement/intervals), and fully adhere to the prompt's constraints without extraneous details or errors.
