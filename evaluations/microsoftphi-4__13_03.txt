8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Part 1 (Exact count)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies "once," matching the ground truth precisely (1 occurrence in case 1002). No errors here—full marks for this section.
- **Part 2 (Explanation)**: The LLM provides a solid, concise response (≈110 words) under the limit, correctly noting the small sample size (3 cases, short timeframe), lack of representativeness, and potential skew from mixed activities. However, it lacks the ground truth's precision and depth: no quantification of sample (14 events, <2 hours), no statistical insight into frequency swings (e.g., 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events), and no mention of near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing matching distortions. These omissions are significant under strict criteria, reducing specificity and analytical rigor, though the core idea of under-representativeness is captured.

Overall, strong on basics but misses key evidential and statistical nuances, warranting a deduction.
