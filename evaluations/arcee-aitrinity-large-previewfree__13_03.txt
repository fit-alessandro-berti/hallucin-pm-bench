6.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Count):** Perfect match (exact string "Manual Fraud Check" appears once in case 1002). +10 points.
- **Part 2 (Explanation):** Partial credit. Correctly identifies small sample (3 cases) and non-representativeness, staying under 120 words (~92). However, significant deductions for:
  - **Speculation violations** (strict data-only rule): Introduces unsubstantiated elements like "variations in fraud check methods across different loan types" and "manual checks might spike during certain periods" (-2.0).
  - **Key omissions from ground truth/data** (-1.5): No mention of exact sample stats (14 events, <2 hours), frequency swing (0% to 7%), wide confidence interval, rare-event sampling error, or near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") that could distort estimates via matching issues.
  - **Less precise/analytical**: Generic bias discussion vs. ground truth's process-mining rigor (quantified error, random sampling need).

Overall: Strong on basics but misses precision, data fidelity, and core insights; strictness applied for differences/speculation.
