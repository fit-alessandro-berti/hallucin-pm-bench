3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Compliance (Strong Match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terms "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as specified, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This fully aligns with the vocabulary policy and ground truth.
  
- **Structure and Format (Partial Match, +1.0 point)**: The table has the correct rows (all six activities) and columns (the four roles). No unwarranted extras like additional tasks, roles, or columns. However, the LLM uses full words ("Responsible") instead of standard RACI abbreviations (R, A, C, I), lacks bolding on key terms/R entries as in ground truth, and includes an explanatory "Key" section that is absent in ground truth (minor unwarranted content). Cells are mostly empty, presented as a simplified table without the combined notations (e.g., **R / A**).

- **RACI Content and Allocations (Poor Match, -7.0 points, major deductions)**: This is the core failure. A RACI matrix requires assignments for Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) across roles. The LLM only assigns R (as "Responsible") to the primary performer per the process description (one R per activity, which matches ground truth's R placements), leaving all else empty ("No involvement"). It completely omits A, C, and I assignments, which ground truth includes extensively (e.g., Account Manager as A or R/A in multiple activities; C and I for other roles like CO, FC, IT in nearly every row). This results in ~80% cell-level differences:
  - E.g., "Receive Application": LLM shows only AM as Responsible (others empty); ground truth has AM **R / A**, CO C, FC I, IT I.
  - E.g., "KYC Review": LLM only CO Responsible (others empty); ground truth has AM A, CO **R**, FC C, IT I.
  - Similar mismatches in every row, ignoring the "narrative reflections" in ground truth notes (e.g., AM accountability where appropriate, consultations/informations inferred from workflow context).
  The LLM's key explicitly limits to R and "empty," confirming it's not a full RACI matrixâ€”effectively a partial responsibility chart. Per strictness, this incomplete implementation (missing half of RACI's elements) warrants severe penalties, as even minor content deviations should lose significant points.

- **Overall Correctness and Adherence (Low, adjusted to 3.0)**: While basic R assignments and terminology are accurate (partial credit), the answer fails to produce a complete RACI matrix that "reflects the narrative" as required and as shown in ground truth. No self-awareness issues apply. Total differences dominate, justifying a low score under utmost strictness.
