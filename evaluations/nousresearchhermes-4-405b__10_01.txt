5.0

The LLM answer has some serious issues compared to the ground truth, especially when scored with utmost strictness as instructed:

**Positives:**
- It uses the strict preferred vocabulary and correct capitalisation ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with no forbidden terms.
- No unwarranted extra content is introduced.
- The basic order and mapping of the activities to responsible roles aligns with the process.

**Negatives/Loss of points:**
- **Major Omission:** Only the "Responsible" (R) role is specified; there is no use of "Accountable" (A), "Consulted" (C), or "Informed" (I) roles at all.
    - In the ground truth, all activities have Accountable roles (often Account Manager), and some roles are Consulted or Informed across steps.
    - This is a fundamental flaw in a RACI matrix, which is meant to show multiple roles and their different types of participation.
- **Key errors per activity:**
    - **Receive Application**: Should have R/A for Account Manager, C for Compliance Officer, I for Finance Clerk and IT Support.
    - **KYC Review**: Should have A (Account Manager), R (Compliance Officer), C (Finance Clerk), I (IT Support).
    - **Order Vetting**: Same pattern as Receive Application.
    - **Payment Clearance**: Account Manager = A, Compliance Officer = C, Finance Clerk = R, IT Support = I.
    - **Record Update** & **Notify Customer**: Similar omissions of all the other involvements present in the ground truth.
- **Key notation missing:** The answer does not explain that an empty cell equals anything in the RACI definitions (even if stated); but, more importantly, it does not provide the full spectrum of involvement.
- **No Accountable role** is ever presented. In the ground truth, several activities assign "R/A" to Account Manager.
- **The level of strictness requested** implies that each missing "C", "I", or "A" is a notable error; therefore major point loss is warranted.

**Summary:**  
While terminology is perfect, the LLM answer's RACI mapping is severely incomplete, omitting key roles in the workflow. It lacks the full depth and insight that a senior process-mapping consultant would be expected to provide. This merits a severe loss of points. 

**Final score: 5.0**
