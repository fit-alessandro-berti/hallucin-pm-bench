9.5

The LLM answer concisely and correctly states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps or duration data, referencing both the lack of time and the inadequacy of occurrence counts. 

Minor issues:  
- The LLM answer could have more explicitly named the "average cycle time from start to complete," as stated in the prompt, but its wording is clear and unmistakably refers to that interval.
- The ground truth answer is slightly more formal and precise in referencing "intervals."

Given the very small differences in expression but no real factual gaps, I deduct only 0.5 points for minor conciseness/wording differences.
