9.5

The LLM answer is fully correct in substance and concisely explains the reasoning: only counts are available, not timestamps, so timing cannot be computed. However, its explanation is a bit less explicit than the ground truth, as it does not mention "start-to-completion intervals" or directly tie the lack of duration data to the impossibility of measuring cycle time. The answer could lose a small fraction of a point (0.5) for not referencing "duration" or "intervals" as in the ground truth, and for being somewhat less complete in phrasing. Otherwise, it is accurate and meets the prompt's requirements.
