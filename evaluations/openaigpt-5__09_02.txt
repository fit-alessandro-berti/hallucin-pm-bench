The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of calculation due to the absence of timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth in core reasoning and explanation. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "It cannot be determined" vs. "It is impossible to compute"; omission of explicit "duration information" and "start-to-completion intervals") and a more concise but less emphatic structure.
