10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data for questions 1-3, with no deviations, inferences, or errors. For question 4, both reasons provided are clear, directly relevant, and align precisely with the ground truth examples (small sample size matches verbatim; the second encompasses temporal bias and representativeness/case-mix bias without hallucination or overreach). No point loss is warranted under strict evaluation, as there are zero differences or small errors.
