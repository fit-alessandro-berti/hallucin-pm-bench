The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides a valid justification by citing specific counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with accurate activity sequences that disprove the "always" claim, directly addressing the task requirements. This is sufficient to invalidate the FACT, as even one counterexample refutes universality. However, it loses 1.0 point for lack of exhaustiveness: it uses "for example" without analyzing all relevant cases (omitting C001 and C003, where the sequence does hold), making it less comprehensive than the ground truth's case-by-case table, which fully verifies the log snippet under the "meticulous" directive. No factual errors, but minor incompleteness in coverage deducts under strict evaluation.
