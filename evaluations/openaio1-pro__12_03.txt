The LLM answer correctly responds "No" and cites both relevant violating cases (C002 and C004) with precise, correct sequences. However, compared to the ground truth, it omits explicit mention of the two conforming cases (C001, C003), does not address the proportion (i.e., 2 out of 4 cases violate), and lacks a structured (e.g., tabular) justification. While these omissions do not affect core correctness, they reduce completeness and thoroughness. Further, it doesn't explicitly mention that "always" is disproven by just one violation, which could make the rationale clearer. These gaps merit a notable penalty despite the answerâ€™s factual accuracy and direct evidence citation.
