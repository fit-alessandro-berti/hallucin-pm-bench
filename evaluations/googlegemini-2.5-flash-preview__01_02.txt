6.5

The LLM answer covers the main decision points and correctly lists all six required documents, using the provided terminology for both sections. However, several issues lower the score significantly under a strict grading:

**Decision points:**
- The answer lists only bullet points and omits the sequence/order context (i.e., not mentioning what step each decision point follows—whereas the ground truth specifies their locations relative to the process steps).
- There is no mention that "Underwriter Alignment Gate" comes after "Dual Underwriter Split," nor that "Amount Threshold Decision" comes after "Neighbourhood Feedback Check." The sequence within the process is an important requirement.
- The operational details inside each decision point are stated, but do not match the exact structure or fullness of the ground truth. For example, the explanation beneath each point is more precise in the ground truth ("if... then... else..." actions).
- The LLM answer does not explicitly clarify that only applications ≥ €15 000 proceed to "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)." This is important for clarity, and explicit in the ground truth.

**Required documents:**
- The list is correct and complete; however, "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds "template," which is not strictly incorrect but deviates from the expected exact term ("Community Impact Statement (CIS)").
- The LLM answer does not add a useful note about exclusions (that no standard loan documents are required), which the ground truth provides for completeness.

**Summary:**
- The answer covers the essentials but lacks necessary detail and structure about process flow and decision logic, and it is less explicit than the ground truth. Even small errors or omissions incur substantial point loss per instructions.

**Final score: 6.5/10**
