### Rationale:
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: Exact count of 1, with correct reference to CaseID 1002. No deductions.
- **Q2 (major partial credit, but strict deductions)**: Covers small sample (3 cases), naming inconsistencies (cites exact variants), and risks undercounting—aligns directionally (~70% overlap). Under 120 words ✓.  
  **Key misses (significant point loss per strictness)**: No quantification of sampling volatility (e.g., 0%-7% swing, wide CI, rare-event error); no strict-vs-fuzzy matching distortion; weaker on temporal granularity (<2 hours, 14 events); adds unemphasized "other days/monthly" speculation vs. GT's focus on excerpt's inadequacy alone. These omissions alter emphasis, reducing fidelity.
