**1.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict per instructions):
- **Vocabulary (partial credit, +0.5)**: Correctly uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly (capitalization/spacing matches). No forbidden terms. Activities list complete and accurate.
- **Structure (partial credit, +0.4)**: RACI matrix format present (rows/columns correct, roles match). Headers include abbreviations (unwarranted addition vs. GT plain names). Uses "-" for uninvolved (GT fills all cells with C/I).
- **Correctness of RACI allocations (major failure, -8.0+ penalty)**: Fundamentally mismatches ground truth and narrative:
  | Activity | Key GT vs. LLM Differences |
  |----------|----------------------------|
  | Receive Application | GT: R/A (AM), C (CO), I (FC/IT). LLM: Only R (AM), ignores others. |
  | **KYC Review** | GT: A (AM), **R** (CO), C (FC), I (IT). LLM: Only A (CO), **no R** (invalid RACI), ignores others. |
  | **Order Vetting** | GT: **R/A** (AM), C (CO), I (FC/IT). LLM: R (AM), **A (FC)** (wrong role). |
  | **Payment Clearance** | GT: A (AM), C (CO), **R** (FC), I (IT). LLM: Only R (FC), ignores others. |
  | Record Update | GT: C (AM/FC), I (CO), **R** (IT). LLM: Only A (IT), **no R** (invalid). |
  | Notify Customer | GT: **R/A** (AM), I (others). LLM: Only R (AM), ignores I's. |
  - No exactly one **R** per row consistently (GT rule). AM not A "where appropriate" (e.g., missing A on KYC/Payment/Record). No bolding on mandated terms/key cells (GT-specific).
- **Unwarranted content (penalty)**: Excessive extras (greeting "Sure...", full RACI explanation, examples, "I hope this helps!", Q&A offer). Introduces no extras tasks/roles/columns but verbose non-matrix text (GT is pure matrix).
- **Overall**: ~80% cell-value differences; invalid RACI rules; ignores narrative nuance (e.g., consultations/informs implied). Strictness demands near-1.0 for core content mismatch despite vocab/structure basics.
