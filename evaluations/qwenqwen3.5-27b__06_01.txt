The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring A), sorts them correctly alphabetically both within pairs (C before Q, P before S) and overall list (C-pair before P-pair), and uses the correct one-per-line format with the specified delimiter. No extra or missing pairs.

Minor deduction for imperfect spacing/formatting match to the ground truth: the second pair lacks the precise padding spaces ("Procure_Materials     —" vs. LLM's likely "Procure_Materials  —"), preventing an exact string match despite functional equivalence. No code block or leading empty line, but these are not strictly required by the prompt. Under utmost strictness, this cosmetic difference warrants a 1.0-point loss.
