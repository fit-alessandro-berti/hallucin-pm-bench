8.0

The LLM answer is clear, concise, and generally follows the instructions, but strict marking reveals these notable shortcomings:

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies and ranks the top 3 worst activities by waiting-time.
- Reports both average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each, matching the table.
- Proposes plausible, relevant actions meant to reduce waiting times for each activity.
- Stays strictly on waiting-time as required.

**Deductions:**
- **Numbers not quoted verbatim.** The word “Avg.” and “95th %ile” are used, rather than the precisely required “avg” and “p95” (as seen in the ground truth). This would be a point off under strict interpretation.
- **Action specificity is weaker.** Each action is more generic than the ground truth’s (e.g., “automated digital reminders” is vaguer than “automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation triggers”; “triage system” is less precise than “rules-engine pre-classification”). Further, the LLM answer omits the ground truth’s pilot/tested or estimated percentage reductions or trigger details, which makes it less actionable and robust.
- **Copyedit: heading/format.** The memo contains extra formalities (“Subject,” “To/from/date”), which are not present in the ground truth, consuming some word budget. The ground truth’s format is terser and more direct.
- **Estimate for ≥20% reduction is asserted** without reference to supporting data/pilot test figures—as required for “data-driven” claims.
- **Minor phrasings/slight verbosity** mean the memo is just a little less crisp than the model provided.

Due to these relatively small but significant deviations, especially in action detail/support and verbatim accuracy, a strict 2-point deduction applies. Thus: **8.0**.
