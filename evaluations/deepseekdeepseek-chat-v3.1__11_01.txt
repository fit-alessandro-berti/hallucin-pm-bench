8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (9/10)**: Activities ranked correctly by average waiting time (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability). Numbers quoted verbatim (e.g., 36.5h/120.0h), with minor formatting variations (e.g., "95th %ile" vs. "p95") that do not alter meaning. No discussion of service-time, throughput, or extraneous activities.
- **No Unwarranted Content (10/10)**: Strictly limited to the three activities and waiting-time metrics only. Memo format and intro are appropriate for an "executive memo" without introducing irrelevant details.
- **Action Relevance (8/10)**: Each action is concrete and logically targets waiting-time bottlenecks (e.g., automation for reminders/dispatch, triage for assessment). They promise ≥20% reduction overall, but lack the ground truth's "data-driven" specificity (e.g., no mentions of pilots, escalations, or per-action estimates like "≥25%" or "30%"). This reduces perceived data backing, warranting a deduction under strict evaluation.
- **Overall Structure & Conciseness (9/10)**: Under 150 words (~120); crisp memo style aligns with prompt, though ground truth is more bare-bones. Small stylistic differences (e.g., full header vs. plain list) are minor but noted for strictness.

Total reflects strong alignment with low major errors, but action detail gaps prevent a perfect score.
