The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying all three parallel blocks with the exact tasks in the correct order and comma separation. The only minor difference is in numbering punctuation (") vs. "."), which does not affect correctness or adherence to the prompt's requirements and warrants no deduction under strict evaluation focused on content accuracy.
