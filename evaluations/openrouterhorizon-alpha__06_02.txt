The LLM answer matches the ground truth answer exactly, both in content and structure. Each parallel block is enumerated on its own numbered line, and the task names are correct and in the proper groupings according to the process description. There are no extraneous tasks or omissions, and there is no mention of tasks outside Process B or any sequential tasks. The answer fully satisfies the evaluation criteria.
