The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly identifying the impossibility of computation due to the redacted event log (no rows, timestamps, or activity instances), explicitly avoiding guesses, and providing a precise, concise explanation in a single paragraph. Minor deductions for extraneous details on the SLA (absent in ground truth, though non-contradictory), the "Summary:" header (unnecessary formatting), and the boxed conclusion (slight deviation from strict "plain text" while not introducing errors). No factual inaccuracies or omissions of key reasons, maintaining high fidelity.
