**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core conclusion (50% weight)**: Partially matches ground truth by eventually stating "cannot derive" (not "cannot be computed"). However, it undermines this with hedging ("confidently estimate", "falls around 1–2 hours"), implying partial derivability. Significant deduction (-2.5/5).
- **Reasoning accuracy (30% weight)**: Major flaws. Fabricates non-existent timestamps/dates ("2023-06-01 to 0.8h", etc., directly pulling from unrelated historical benchmarks). Misattributes activities/resources (e.g., "Negotiate Terms" in C-002 by "drafter_3" — absent in log). Ignores redaction explicitly stated in header. Introduces irrelevant "normalizing" and estimations. Ground truth reasoning is precise (no temporal data); LLM's is confabulated/wrong. Heavy deduction (-2.7/3).
- **Fidelity to instructions/prompt structure (10% weight)**: Addresses both Q1/Q2 loosely but not briefly/clearly. Lists cases incorrectly, rambles unnecessarily. Does not "state clearly that the requested value cannot be derived" upfront — buries it after errors. Deduction (-0.7/1).
- **Conciseness & no fabrication (10% weight)**: Rambling, speculative ("assuming reasonable estimation"). Introduces unrelated "Negotiate Terms" analysis. Violates "answer only if supported" by pseudo-analysis. Deduction (-0.8/1).

Total raw alignment ~32% of ideal; scaled strictly to 3.2/10. Small errors (e.g., minor listing slips) compounded by large ones (hallucinations) justify severe penalty.
