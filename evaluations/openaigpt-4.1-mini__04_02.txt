5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Correct status and justification (minor wording differences, but accurate and concise). Full credit.
- **R2**: Correct status, but justification contains factual error (Ship_Goods is ~1 day after initial Finance_Approval, not three; misses key point of post-change approval on 07-Mar as the relevant "last required approval"). Significant deduction for inaccuracy.
- **R3**: Correct status and justification. Full credit.
- **R4**: Correct status and justification. Full credit.
- **R5**: Incorrect status (should be Violated); justification ignores sequence where Ship_Goods, Pay_Invoice, and Receive_Goods precede new Manager_Approval, violating "before any further processing step." Major error, severe deduction.
- **R6**: Correct status and justification. Full credit.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but misses R5 violation, reducing reliability. Format adheres to prompt (no table required).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, errors in R2 justification and R5 status (core compliance misinterpretation) warrant substantial point loss despite partial alignment; score reflects ~60% accuracy with critical flaws.
