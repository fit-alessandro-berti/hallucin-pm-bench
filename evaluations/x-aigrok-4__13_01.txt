9.0

1. The answer "1" is correct.
2. The answer "5.56" is numerically correct and matches the ground truth, but it is missing the `%` symbol and the explicit calculation, which is present in the ground truth. Given the explicit rounding request and formatting, this minor omission costs a small fraction of a point.
3. The answer "A1002" is correct, clear, and formatted acceptably.
4. Both reasons are reasonable and factually accurate: 
   - The response covers the temporal bias ("fragment covers only a single day") and the small sample size ("only 4 cases and 18 events"). These map exactly to two of the ideal points and are stated clearly and factually.
   
Very minor formatting/presentation shortcomings (omitting the % symbol, no explicit calculation for Q2, less verbose in Q3) prevent a perfect score under maximum strictness, but all critical factual content is present and strictly adherent to instructions.
