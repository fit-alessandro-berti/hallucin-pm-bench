8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match to the core fact (1 occurrence). Full points, but brevity without "occurrence" is minor deduction in strict phrasing adherence.
- **Question 2**: Numerical value correct (5.56), but omits "%" symbol and any reference to calculation or explanation (e.g., 1/18 × 100). Significant loss for incompleteness in a strict evaluation.
- **Question 3**: Correct identifier (A1002), but lacks "only" qualifier, full sentence structure, and quoted activity name as in ground truth. Substantial deduction for imprecise phrasing.
- **Question 4**: Provides exactly two clear, relevant reasons (temporal bias via single-day coverage; small sample size with variability explanation), aligning directly with ground truth options. Full points.

Overall: Strong factual accuracy (no hallucinations or inferences beyond log), but deductions for formatting, explanatory details, and phrasing omissions reduce from a potential perfect score. Total events are 18, Manual_Fraud_Check appears once in A1002 only—LLM stays grounded.
