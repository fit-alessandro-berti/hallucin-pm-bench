7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Correctness (High Weight)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" and pinpoints the exact violations (Rules 2 and 3), matching the ground truth. All other rules (1, 4, 5) are accurately assessed as satisfied, with appropriate citations to events and roles. The conclusion ties back to the violations correctly.
- **Differences and Errors (Strict Deduction)**:
  - **Rule 3 Labeling Error (Significant Deduction: -1.5 points)**: The header states "– Complied with" while the explanation clearly describes a violation and concludes "Rule 3 is **also violated**". This is a contradictory and sloppy inconsistency not present in the ground truth, which cleanly labels it as "Violated". Under strictness, this undermines clarity and professionalism.
  - **Rule 3 Distance Calculation Error (Moderate Deduction: -1.0 point)**: LLM calculates "distance = 4" (listing steps 7, 8, 9, 10 as four positions after event 6), while ground truth specifies "distance = 3" (next two activities as 7 and 8, with event 10 exceeding). Though both agree on violation (>2), the numerical discrepancy is a factual error in interpretation of "distance ≤ 2", reflecting imprecise analysis.
- **Structural and Stylistic Differences (Minor Deduction: -0.0 points, as not penalizing format unless erroneous)**: LLM uses bolding, sub-bullets, and reorders (starting with violations), which adds verbosity but doesn't alter facts. Ground truth is more concise and sequentially numbered (1-5). No deduction here, as the prompt allows "numbered justification" without specifying exact style.
- **Completeness**: Covers all rules with event citations, similar to ground truth. No omissions or hallucinations.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: With "utmost strictness" and "significant loss for small errors", the two Rule 3 issues (labeling and calculation) prevent a perfect score, but the core compliance judgment is robust, so not below 7.0.
