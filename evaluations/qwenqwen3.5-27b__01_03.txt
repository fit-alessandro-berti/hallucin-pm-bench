**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part a) (Decision points)**: ~9/10. Identifies both correct decision points with accurate one-sentence rules matching the process logic. Minor deductions for: (1) naming as "Step 4" vs. ground truth's precise "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; (2) omitting explicit "otherwise proceeds to review" clause; (3) phrasing "grant approval" vs. "record 'Approve'"; (4) extraneous "or" in approver list; (5) currency formatting ("€250,000" vs. "€250 000").
- **Part b) (Documents)**: ~5/10. Major errors: (1) Omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" entirely (critical failure to list **ALL** documents; it's explicitly listed separately in step 8); (2) Wrong order—places "ID Matrix Declaration" too early (after "Offer Sheet 77" as #7, vs. ground truth #8 after Signed version); (3) Results in only 8 items vs. 9. First 6 items correct, but incompleteness and reordering are significant deviations.
- **Overall**: Strong structure and no hallucinations, but b)'s omission of a distinct required document and order error violate "ALL documents ... in the order they first appear," warranting substantial penalty under utmost strictness (weighted average ~7.0; perfect match =10.0).
