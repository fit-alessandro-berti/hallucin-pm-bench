The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth for Q2 (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5). However, it contains a significant factual error in the explanation: T3 is enabled immediately after T1 (due to the token in P2), not "before T3 is ever enabled," as the LLM statesâ€”this misrepresents Petri net enabling conditions and token flow. The ground truth accurately describes the scenario without this flaw, including markings for clarity. Additional issues include unnecessary formatting (e.g., "### Summary," boxed answer) and less precise phrasing, diverging from the ground truth's concise, detailed structure. Under strict evaluation, these differences, especially the core explanatory error, warrant a notable deduction despite the correct core response.
