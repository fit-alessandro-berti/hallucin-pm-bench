The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in structure (numbered responses matching the query), core conclusion (cannot derive/compute), and reasoning (lack of timestamps/durations preventing cycle time calculation). Minor deductions for: (1) phrasing variations ("derived" vs. "computed"; "data provided" vs. "information provided"); (2) extraneous detail listing specific cases (C-001 to C-004), which is factually correct but not in ground truth; (3) omission of "ordering information" and "any numeric answer would be fabricated" emphasis, slightly less comprehensive under strict scrutiny. No factual errors or policy violations.
