**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect. It wrongly answers Q1 as "No" (ground truth: "Yes"), with a reversed misunderstanding of the net (claims T3 enables P2 token, but T3 *consumes* from P2; P2 is enabled by T1). It skips Q2 entirely (should provide sequence). No alignment with ground truth sequence or reasoning. Complete failure.
