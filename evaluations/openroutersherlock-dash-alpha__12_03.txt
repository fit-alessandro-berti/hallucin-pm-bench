The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a solid justification by citing specific counterexamples (C002 and C004) with accurate activity sequences and timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns well with the ground truth's core reasoning. Minor deductions for: (1) omitting C003 (a supporting case, reducing completeness compared to the ground truth's exhaustive case-by-case table); (2) awkwardly including C001 (a non-counterexample) in the "counterexamples" list without clarifying its supportive role, which slightly muddles the structure; and (3) less formal presentation (bullet list vs. table), though still clear and evidence-based. No factual errors in sequences or logic.
