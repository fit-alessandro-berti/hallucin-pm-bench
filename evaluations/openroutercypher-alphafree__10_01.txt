6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer strictly follows the required terminology (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”), never using forbidden terms.
- No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced—only the specified process steps and roles are used.
- Each activity has exactly one Responsible (R), and roles are correctly matched to their main actions per the legacy and preferred process descriptions.

**Weaknesses:**
1. **Major Omission of RACI Roles:**  
   - Only "R" (Responsible) is used. There is no use of "A" (Accountable), "C" (Consulted), or "I" (Informed). The ground truth has combinations (e.g., "R / A", "C", "I"), providing a full RACI allocation that clarifies roles’ involvement. The LLM answer ignores this, greatly reducing its accuracy and depth.
   - All secondary involvements are missing (e.g., the ground truth shows IT Support as "I" on multiple steps, Consulted/Accountable/Responsible distinctions).

2. **Specific Allocations Missed:**  
   - For instance, in “Receive Application”, the ground truth assigns “R/A” to AM, “C” to CO, and “I” to FC/IT, but only “R” is given to AM in the LLM response.
   - In "KYC Review", only the Compliance Officer is “R”, but the ground truth stipulates “A” to AM, “C” to FC, and "I" to IT as well.
   - Similarly, other steps miss secondary involvements and accountability.

**Summary:**  
While terminology is flawless and columns/rows are correct, the RACI role allocations are dramatically oversimplified. Omitting A/C/I roles and not following the multi-role allocations in the ground truth is a significant error, so even though the terms are perfect (avoiding a score below 6), the allocation flaw causes a large penalty.

**Final score: 6.0**
