The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without any forbidden variants, and it accurately identifies the single Responsible (R) role per activity based directly on the process narrative, with no extraneous content added. However, it fails catastrophically as a RACI matrix by omitting all Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments, leaving 18 of 24 cells blank instead of providing the full, inferred collaborative allocations shown in the ground truth (e.g., Account Manager as A in multiple steps, widespread C/I across roles). Headers include unnecessary abbreviations (e.g., "(AM)"), differing from the ground truth, and lack the bolding/formatting on key terms and assignments. These omissions and mismatches represent fundamental incompleteness in reflecting a proper RACI structure, warranting severe deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
