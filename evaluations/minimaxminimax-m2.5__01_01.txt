**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: 
  - Documents list is **identical** (same 7 items, same order, no extras introduced; minor phrasing variations like descriptions are accurate inferences without violating "do not introduce artefacts").
  - Covers all process elements without adding undefined activities/artefacts.
  - Clear, structured tables; explains dependencies accurately (e.g., final steps as execution).

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Decision points mismatch (major difference, -2.0 points)**: 4 points vs. ground truth's 3. LLM splits/renames (e.g., treats Finance_PreApprove and Senior_Review as fully separate decisions #2/#4; names activities directly as "decision points" vs. ground truth's descriptive phrasing like "*Eligibility check* during..."). Threshold placement/logic similar but not exact (LLM #3 vs. ground truth #2 "after Finance"). No explicit branching outcomes (e.g., "*Rejected* → ends") as in ground truth.
  - **Table structure/content divergence (-0.5 points)**: Extra columns ("What is decided", "Relevant documents"); integrates docs into table (prompt asks to **list all required documents** separately). Claims "(as named in the process)" inaccurately for threshold.
  - **Minor errors/interpretations (-0.5 points)**: EligibilityChecklist "produced after step 1" (imprecise; step 1 is Customer_Submit, logically post-Triage). Descriptions add unstated details (e.g., WeatherReport "confirm...adverse weather"; checklist "completed by triage").

Overall: High fidelity (~85% match) but structural/content differences in core "decision points" (prompt's first half) warrant deduction under "utmost strictness" and "small errors → significant loss".
