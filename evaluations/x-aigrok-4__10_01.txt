4.0

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Terminology (strength, full points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This aligns perfectly with the ground truth and policy.
  
- **Structure and Format (partial credit, minor deductions)**: The matrix follows the required format (activities as rows, roles as columns) with no extra tasks, roles, or unwarranted content. Abbreviations (AM, CO, etc.) are used and explained, which is acceptable given the prompt's role notations but differs from the ground truth's full role names. No bolding on mandated terms or R/A notations (ground truth uses **bold** for synonyms and **R / A** with slashes), and comma-separated R,A vs. ground truth's **R / A**—small formatting inconsistencies deduct points under strictness.

- **RACI Allocations (major deductions, core weakness)**: This is the primary area of divergence, leading to significant point loss due to numerous differences from the ground truth. The narrative is sparse, but the ground truth infers specific consultations (C) and informings (I) that the LLM omits entirely in most cells, treating them as "no involvement" (blanks). Key issues:
  - **Responsible (R)**: Correct in all 6 activities (one R per activity, matching narrative performers: AM for Receive/Order/Notify, CO for KYC, FC for Payment, IT for Record). This provides baseline credit.
  - **Accountable (A)**: Incorrect in 3/6 activities. LLM assigns A to the R performer universally (e.g., CO R,A for KYC; FC R,A for Payment Clearance), but ground truth separates A (often to AM) where appropriate (e.g., AM A for KYC/Payment; no A for Record). For Record Update, LLM adds unwarranted IT A (ground truth has none). Correct for Receive, Order Vetting, Notify.
  - **Consulted (C) and Informed (I)**: Massive gaps—LLM misses ~80% of ground truth's C/I assignments (e.g., Receive: misses CO C, FC I, IT I; KYC: misses FC C, IT I, and wrongly places AM I instead of A; similar omissions across Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, Record Update, Notify). Only 4/24 cells partially align beyond R/A (e.g., CO I in Order Vetting is close but wrong vs. C; FC I in Record matches but contextually incomplete). Blanks do not "reflect the narrative" fully, as ground truth infers broader involvement.
  
  Overall, while R aligns with the minimal narrative, the LLM's minimalistic approach ignores implied consultations/informings in the ground truth, resulting in an incomplete matrix. Each mismatch (13+ cells differ) is treated as a significant error under strict rubric, heavily penalizing despite terminology success.

- **Other (no extra deductions)**: No self-awareness issues (N/A). Legend for R/A/C/I is helpful but absent in ground truth—neutral.

This yields a low-mid score: strong on basics (terms, R, structure) but critically flawed on full RACI fidelity, justifying 4.0 under utmost strictness.
