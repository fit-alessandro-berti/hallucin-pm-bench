6.0

- **Preferred terminology compliance:** The LLM answer consistently uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" as required. No forbidden terms appear. Full points for terminology.
- **Format and presentation:** The matrix is clear and roles match columns; the activities are in the correct sequence.
- **Major issues:**
    - **RACI designations are incomplete and incorrect compared to the ground truth.**
        - The ground truth provides more nuance, repeatedly marking multiple roles as "C", "I", etc. The LLM answer only uses R, A, I, and omits "C" entirely (consulted), which is a significant deviation.
        - The LLM tends to mark "R, A" together (when in the ground truth "R/A" is only for the Account Manager, and others are often "R", "A", "C", or "I").
        - For example, "KYC Review": LLM assigns CO as "R, A", but misses AM as "A", FC as "C", IT as "I".
        - "Order Vetting": LLM misses out on others' involvement (they all have a role per ground truth).
    - **Incorrect/incomplete involvement:** Each activity in the ground truth has various C/I designations for roles that LLM leaves blank, under-representing the process's collaboration.
    - Some roles should be "C" or "I" but are left blank (e.g., Finance Clerk and IT on "Receive Application").
- **Minor issues:**
    - The ground truth provides slightly more explicit labeling (using, e.g., "R/A", not "R, A"), but that is minor.

**Summary:** The LLM correctly observed the terminology restrictions and reproduced the correct activities and overall structure. However, there is a substantial deviation in the RACI responsibilities assigned to each role per activity: many consulted and informed roles are omitted, as are some accountabilities. This reflects a significant drop in process mapping fidelity and strictness of interpretation. Hence the score is 6/10.
