**3.2**

### Key Differences and Strict Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Correct elements (partial credit)**: Identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst based on joint SLA breaches + high waits (+1.0). Mentions waiting times accurately (+1.0). Uses bullets for recommendations (+0.5). Memo-like format (~250 words, close to 150) (+0.5). No absent activities/metrics (+0.2).
- **Major failures**:
  - **Quantifications completely wrong/invented** (-3.5): LLM fabricates throughput times (Risk Review: 1080s vs table 600s; Legal: 1500s vs 900s; Credit: 500s vs 300s) and exceedances (780s/900s/260s vs GT/table: +300s/+300s/+60s). Violates "ground in data; do NOT invent" and core task.
  - **Recommendations vague, not data-driven/concrete** (-1.8): Generic (e.g., "automated tools," "training") vs GT's specific actions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one analyst," "straight-through heuristic"). No data ties like cases/volumes.
  - **Structure violations** (-1.0): Bullets used for activity descriptions (not "only for recommendations"); full email with greeting/closing/subject mismatch GT; extra narrative vs GT's concise analysis.
  - **Minor errors** (-0.7): Wrong order (Risk first); invented phrasing (e.g., "considerably higher"); no case totals or projections; exceeds "only memo text."
  
Utmost strictness applied: Data errors alone warrant <5.0; cumulative flaws prevent higher score.
