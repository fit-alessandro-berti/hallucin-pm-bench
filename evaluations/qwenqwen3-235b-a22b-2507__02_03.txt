9.0

- Q1 matches closely in content (minor addition of "distinct" is accurate but slightly verbose; no factual error).
- Q2 is factually correct but adds unnecessary explanatory phrasing beyond the concise "Pack_Items" expected, violating strict conciseness.
- Q3 is factually correct but similarly verbose with extra words, reducing alignment with the minimal ground truth format.
