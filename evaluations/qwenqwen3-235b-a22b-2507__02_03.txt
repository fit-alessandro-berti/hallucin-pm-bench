- The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, with the only small deviation being the use of quotation marks around activity names and a slightly more verbose form for question 2 (“Pack_Items” immediately precedes “Ship_Order” for case C456 instead of just “Pack_Items”).  
- All content is correct and the points are concise; however, strictness on formatting and absolute conciseness results in a full point deduction.
