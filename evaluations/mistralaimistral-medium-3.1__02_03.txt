8.0

- The LLM answer is substantively correct across all three questions, accurately identifying the cases, the preceding activity for C456, and the unique activity.
- Q1 deducts slightly for extraneous wording ("distinct") and formatting (bolding cases), deviating from the concise ground truth phrasing.
- Q2 deducts more notably for adding unrequested timestamp details, violating the "concise... only" instruction and introducing non-ground-truth content.
- Q3 has minor formatting differences (bolding and quotes) but matches content exactly.
- Overall strict evaluation: core accuracy high, but small additions and inconsistencies warrant deductions from a perfect score.
