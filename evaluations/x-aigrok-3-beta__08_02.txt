1.0

The LLM answer is entirely incorrect on the main factual point:

- For **Q1**, the correct answer is "Yes", but the LLM answer says "No," directly contradicting the ground truth.
- For **Q2**, since the first answer is incorrect, the explanation is also factually wrong. The LLM claims the Petri net structure "enforces T3’s firing prior to T5’s enablement," when in fact there is an alternative path, as stated in the ground truth.
- No partial credit is warranted, as the LLM misses the fundamental alternative path, and its structural reasoning is incorrect.

Due to this total factual and analytical error, the only appropriate score is **1.0**.
