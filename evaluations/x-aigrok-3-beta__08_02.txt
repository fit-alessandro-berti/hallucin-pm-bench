The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, directly contradicting the ground truth on Q1 (No vs. Yes) and providing flawed reasoning for Q2 that ignores the viable alternative path via T7 to enable T5 without T3. No credit for partial acknowledgment of T7, as the core conclusion and lack of sequence demonstration indicate complete misunderstanding of the Petri net structure.
