**2.0**

The LLM answer has critical errors vs. ground truth, warranting severe deduction under strict criteria:

- **Wrong timer type**: "Non-interrupting" (parallel path) vs. interrupting (cancels main flow). Non-interrupting fails to bypass delays, allowing late Triage.
- **Wrong target**: Flow to "End_Done" (skips Triage entirely) vs. "Task_Triage" (forces timely Triage). LLM claims "ensuring ... reaches triage" but sends to End—self-contradictory, violates SLA intent.
- **No escalation fit**: Early End isn't clear "auto-escalation"; ground truth ensures Triage in 48h via bypass.
- **Vague extras**: "Or Task_Check/additional end event" adds non-specificity; no timer ID or XML like `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`.
- Partial credit for PT48H, boundary timer idea, Task_Receive reference, new flow—but core mechanism fails SLA compliance.
