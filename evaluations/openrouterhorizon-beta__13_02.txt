The LLM answer fully matches the ground truth: exact counts and percentages for Q1-Q2 (deterministic), and Q3 concisely addresses the single-occurrence issue (explicitly notes "only one occurrence"), variance/instability ("statistically unstable and prone to overfitting"), and over-generalization risks ("skewing... misleading predictors... unreliable... poor policy decisions") without excess words or inventions.
