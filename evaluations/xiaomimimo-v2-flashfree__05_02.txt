**1.0**

The LLM answer fails entirely against the ground truth: it modifies the wrong task (`Task_SignContract` instead of `Task_CollectEquipment`), applies the wrong `dueDate` value (`P1D` vs. `P2D`), uses an invalid unified diff format (missing `@@` hunk headers and proper context/indentation), and provides an incorrect rationale (assumes/misleads on a 5-day window instead of fixing to a 3-day SLA), violating the core task of proposing the exact expected SLA fix.
