10.0

The LLM answer is correct, concise, and matches the required bullet-point format exactly. Content is identical to ground truth (minor phrasing like "distinct" aligns with prompt wording; underscore escaping is markdown artifact irrelevant to plain answer; absence of labels matches prompt's "concise" instruction). No errors or differences impacting accuracy.
