The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a precise, one-paragraph justification citing the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7, C005 lines 11-12) as the ground truth, accurately disproving the "always follows" claim. Minor deductions for: (1) inclusion of unnecessary but accurate timestamps (10:43Z, 10:45Z), adding extraneous detail not in ground truth; (2) slight phrasing differences like "the payment was validated before the order was received" and "did not follow a Receive_Order" vs. ground truth's more neutral "occurs first... only afterwards"; (3) lack of markdown formatting (e.g., no bold **No**, no italics on activities); (4) no explicit concluding summary sentence tying back to "not always." No factual errors, and it adheres better to the prompt's "one paragraph" structure than the ground truth's bullets.
