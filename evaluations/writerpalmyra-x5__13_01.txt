**9.8**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict assessment against ground truth):
1. **Perfect match** (1.0/1.0): Exact count "1", aligns with "`1` occurrence".
2. **Perfect match** (1.0/1.0): "5.56%" with calculation shown, matches "`5.56 %`" and formula precisely.
3. **Near-perfect** (0.95/1.0): Correctly identifies **A1002**, but omits "only" (ground truth: "Only case **A1002**"); uses "the case identifier" (singular) vs. prompt's "identifier(s)" and ground truth phrasing. Minor wording deviation deducts 0.05.
4. **Excellent, but minor deviations** (1.8/2.0): Both reasons clearly stated and match two ground truth options ("Small sample size" – cites "18 events across 4 cases"; "Temporal bias" – single day). However:
   - Lacks specific variance example ("±5.56 pp.") in sample size.
   - Adds unsubstantiated examples ("weekends, peak periods, policy changes") and calls event "relatively rare" (mild inference beyond log).
   - Ground truth allows "any two" but expects close phrasing/clarity; deducts 0.2 for extras and missing detail.

**Total: 4.75/5.0** → **9.8/10.0** (no hallucinations, fully answers all, adheres to log-only rule; tiny phrasing/precision gaps prevent 10.0 under utmost strictness).
