3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Strength)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This matches the ground truth perfectly (+2.0 points baseline for core policy compliance).
- **Structure and Content (Partial Match)**: The table format is appropriate (activities as rows, roles as columns), with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. Activities list is identical to ground truth. However, the LLM adds an unwarranted explanation section not present in the ground truth, which introduces unnecessary content (-0.5 points).
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors)**: 
  - Responsible (R) assignments are correct for all activities, matching the narrative's performers (e.g., AM for Receive Application, CO for KYC Review, etc.) (+1.0 point).
  - No Accountable (A) designations are included, despite the ground truth specifying A for AM in 5/6 activities (Receive, KYC, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, Notify). This is a critical omission, as the notes emphasize "Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate" (-2.0 points).
  - Consulted (C) and Informed (I) are mishandled: The LLM defaults all non-R roles to C uniformly, ignoring the ground truth's nuanced distinctions (e.g., for Receive Application, ground truth has C for CO only and I for FC/IT, but LLM uses C for all; similar mismatches in 80%+ of non-R cells across rows). This results in ~18/24 cells differing, violating strict narrative reflection (-3.0 points total for RACI inaccuracies).
- **Formatting and Precision (Minor Errors)**: No bolding or merged "R/A" notations as in ground truth. Column headers include abbreviations in parentheses (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), differing from ground truth's plain names. Explanation text has a small inaccuracy ("Notifying the Customer" vs. "Notify Customer") (-0.5 points).
- **Overall Strictness**: With multiple cell-level differences (especially missing A and incorrect C/I), the answer deviates significantly from the ground truth despite correct R's and vocabulary. No self-awareness issues apply. Total deductions outweigh strengths, yielding a low score reflective of substantial inaccuracies.
