**Analysis of LLM Answer vs Ground Truth**

**Terminology (strict vocabulary policy):**
- All three required terms (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”) appear correctly. No forbidden terms are present.
- ✅ No point lost here.

**RACI Matrix (Role Assignments):**
- **Main errors:**
  - The LLM marks all non-primary roles as “C” (Consulted), which is incorrect according to the ground-truth (should use combinations of Accountable (A), Informed (I), and Consulted (C) precisely).
  - “R / A” vs “R”: The LLM never marks anyone as Accountable (“A”). The ground truth expects “R / A” (both Responsible and Accountable) for most AM activities. LLM implies only “R”.
  - “I” (Informed) is missing entirely in LLM answer, while the ground truth makes extensive use of “I” to indicate roles that are merely kept in the loop (example: IT Support is “I” on most activities except their own).
- **Row-by-row discrepancies:**
  - **Receive Application:** GT = AM (R/A), CO(C), FC(I), IT(I) / LLM = AM(R), all others C.
  - **KYC Review:** GT = CO(R), AM(A), FC(C), IT(I) / LLM = CO(R), all others C.
  - **Order Vetting:** GT = AM(R/A), CO(C), FC(I), IT(I) / LLM = AM(R), all others C.
  - **Payment Clearance:** GT = FC(R), AM(A), CO(C), IT(I) / LLM = FC(R), all others C.
  - **Record Update:** GT = IT(R), AM(C), CO(I), FC(C) / LLM = IT(R), all others C.
  - **Notify Customer:** GT = AM(R/A), all others I / LLM = AM(R), all others C.
- **Therefore:** Significant difference in how roles are marked as Accountable/Consulted/Informed. This is a fundamental error under strictly applied grading.

**Structure/Output:**
- The table has the correct activities and roles, in proper order. No extra/missing roles or activities.
- Readable and clear markdown table format.

**Explanation:**
- Additional explanations provided, which are not forbidden but aren’t required and do not compensate for errors above.
- Some inaccuracies in these explanations (by assuming everyone except the main role is “consulted or informed”; ground truth distinguishes C and I explicitly).

**Penalty for Errors:**
- The most important errors are:
  1. Completely omits “Accountable” designation (“A”), always uses just “R”.
  2. Does not use “I” (Informed) at all; instead, always “C” or nothing.
  3. Gets the pattern of role assignments fundamentally wrong by oversimplifying everyone but the main actor as “C”.

Given the prompt’s instructions for “utmost strictness,” and that these are not small but significant flaws, the score should be docked heavily.

**Summary:**
- Vocabulary: 10/10
- Structure (ordering, headers): 10/10
- RACI allocations: 2/10 (serious and systematic errors)
- No unwarranted content, no forbidden terms.

**Weighted strict average:**
- Because the RACI allocations are critical to the purpose, the penalty is steep.

**FINAL SCORE: 5.5**
