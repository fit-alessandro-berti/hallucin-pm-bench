7.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches (quantified precisely as +300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Grounds all metrics directly in table data, includes case volumes (accurate: 465, 480, 1175). Uses bullets *only* for recommendations. Memo format, ≈160 words (close to 150 target). No invented activities/metrics beyond logical inferences.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences)**: 
  - Order mismatch: Lists Risk Review first (worse than Legal Approval, which has superior metrics: 900s throughput/600s wait vs. 600s/480s; -0.5).
  - Structure/format differs: Narrative paragraphs vs. ground truth's concise bolded list-lines (-0.5). Extra title/Date/long subject vs. minimal header (-0.3).
  - Intro/body wording divergent: Explanatory inferences (e.g., "capacity bottleneck impacts customer experience") vs. factual summary; mentions cases absent in ground truth (-0.4).
  - Recommendations completely different (generic automation/tiering vs. specific pre-checks/analyst add/heuristic; neither perfectly "data-driven" from table, but mismatch penalizes heavily; -1.0).
  - No closing projection (matches prompt better by not inventing, but differs from ground truth; neutral).
- **Overall**: Core analysis/quantification perfect (drives score up), but stylistic, order, and rec mismatches prevent >8.0 under utmost strictness (small errors like order/wording cost 0.2-0.5 each; total deductions -2.5 from 10.0 base). Ground truth itself invents (e.g., "4805 cases," "35%," "€25k," "peak morning") violating prompt, but evaluation is relative to it.
