7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Format and Structure**: The LLM answer closely follows the required format (status bolded, ≤20-word justifications, all-caps overall result). Minor deviation in presentation (bolded labels vs. table), but compliant with prompt instructions. No deduction here.
- **R1**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, similar justification focusing on sequence and amount). Full credit.
- **R2**: Major error—incorrectly deems Compliant, ignoring the Change_Request's impact on requiring a new approval (final approval on 07-Mar, making Ship_Goods on 05-Mar non-compliant with the 2-day rule post-last approval). Justification flawed. Significant deduction (-2.5 points).
- **R3**: Matches ground truth (Violated, accurate on timing of Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods). Full credit.
- **R4**: Matches ground truth (Not Applicable, correct on hazardous=false). Full credit.
- **R5**: Matches status (Violated), but justification incomplete—mentions only Ship_Goods, omits Pay_Invoice as a further processing step before new approval (per ground truth). Minor imprecision, but captures essence. Small deduction (-0.5 points).
- **R6**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, accurate on termination). Full credit.
- **Overall Result**: Correctly NON-COMPLIANT, though misses one violation (R2) in reasoning. No additional deduction beyond per-rule errors.

Total score reflects high accuracy on 5/6 rules, but strict penalty for the critical R2 error and minor R5 gap, as per evaluation criteria.
