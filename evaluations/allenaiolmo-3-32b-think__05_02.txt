The LLM answer fails catastrophically: incorrect task modified (GrantAccess instead of CollectEquipment), wrong direction (extends P1D to P2D instead of reducing P5D to P2D), erroneous element type change (serviceTask to userTask, violating no-add/delete rule), malformed/incomplete diff hunk including unchanged lines, illogical rationale worsening SLA instead of fixing it, and improper output formatting with extraneous "diff --git" header and "Rationale:" label.
