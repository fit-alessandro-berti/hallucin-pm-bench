The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, directly addressing the impossibility of calculation due to missing timestamps and presence of only event counts, closely mirroring the ground truth's core reasoning. It loses 0.5 points for not explicitly mentioning "duration information" or "start-to-completion intervals," which adds a slight layer of precision in the ground truth.
