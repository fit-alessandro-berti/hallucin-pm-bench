The LLM answer is thorough and correctly explains why the average cycle time for “Dual Authorization” cannot be computed, given the lack of timestamps or duration information—echoing the ground truth rationale. However, the response is far too long, with substantial repetition and meta-analysis of the prompt, rather than providing a single, concise sentence as explicitly instructed by the prompt and demonstrated in the ground truth answer.

Key points for the deduction:
- **Accuracy of Reasoning**: The answer reaches the correct conclusion for the correct reasons.
- **Brevity**: The answer should have been a single, concise sentence, per explicit instructions.
- **Directness**: There is too much meta-commentary and internal deliberation, rather than directly supplying the needed answer.

Thus, for correctness with failure to be succinct and concise as required, I deduct one full point.
