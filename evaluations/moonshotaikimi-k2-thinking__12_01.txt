10.0

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in verdict, justification structure, case-by-case evidence, citation of relevant activities/cases, and conclusion. It correctly identifies the reversed ordering, absence in Case 1002 disproving "always," and lack of immediate precedence (including noting the intervening activity in Case 1003, which aligns with the data). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., using timestamps vs. line numbers; phrasing of conclusion) do not constitute errors, as the prompt requires a short justification citing cases and activities, which is fully met without deviation from the data.
