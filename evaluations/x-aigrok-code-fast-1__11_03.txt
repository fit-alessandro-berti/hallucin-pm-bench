### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core requirements: it correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, accurately quantifies SLA exceedances (e.g., +300s, +300s, +60s), and structures recommendations in bullet points only. It adheres to the prompt by grounding content in table data (no invented activities/metrics) and returns only memo text (~195 words, near the ≈150 target). However, under strict evaluation, deductions apply for:

- **Structural and stylistic differences (-0.5):** Lacks ground truth's To/From fields, specific subject details (e.g., "Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)"), case total mention (~4,805, derivable from data), bolding/formatting for emphasis, and closing impact projection (e.g., "reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35%"), making it less executive/polished.
- **Recommendation quality (-1.3):** Actions are data-driven (referencing metrics) but generic/vague (e.g., "allocate additional resources," "training staff") compared to ground truth's concrete, innovative specifics (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"). Minor imprecisions in LLM wording (e.g., "waiting times over 480 seconds" vs. average 480s; "cases exceeding 200 seconds" vs. average) introduce small factual slips, warranting significant point loss per instructions.

Overall, the answer is strong and faithful to data but falls short in precision, specificity, and executive flair relative to the ground truth.
