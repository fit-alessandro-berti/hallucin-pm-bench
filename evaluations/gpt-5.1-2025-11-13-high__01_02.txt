### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points Section (Major Deduction: ~6 points lost)**: The ground truth identifies exactly 3 true branching decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval), focusing solely on flow-altering gates with precise descriptions. The LLM answer incorrectly expands this to 8 points, misclassifying non-branching steps (e.g., Quick KYC Verification, Community Impact Assessment, Dual Underwriter Split, Neighbourhood Feedback Check) as "decision points" by fabricating downstream "decisions" (e.g., "decide whether KYC is satisfied," "decide on the assessed community impact"). It separates Harmonisation Committee as a standalone point instead of integrating it into Underwriter Alignment Gate. This over-interpretation violates the prompt's intent to summarize *decision points* (implying branches), introduces unsubstantiated details, and deviates significantly from the ground truth's concise structure and content. Even the correct points (4, 7, 8) include extraneous phrasing (e.g., "the case continues to NFC" in Alignment Gate).
  
- **Required Documents Section (Minor Deduction: ~0.5 points lost)**: The list is complete and uses exact activity names without introducing standard terminology. However, small phrasing errors relative to ground truth include: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; " (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)". The LLM omits the ground truth's explanatory note on excluded documents, which provides clarifying context aligned with the process's non-standard nature.

Overall, while the LLM follows the prompt's terminology and structure superficially, the bloated and inaccurate decision points section dominates the evaluation, reflecting poor fidelity to the ground truth under strict criteria.
