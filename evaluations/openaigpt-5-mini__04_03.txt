The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses all four rules with the same pass/fail outcomes as the ground truth (Rules 1, 2, and 4 satisfied; Rule 3 violated). Justifications are concise, reference the relevant rules, and explain the violation in Rule 3 appropriately, aligning closely with the prompt's requirements. Minor deductions for: (1) slightly less emphasis on "both QE and RA" in the Rule 3 explanation (ground truth explicitly highlights this); (2) lack of an explicit concluding statement on overall non-compliance (ground truth reinforces it); and (3) use of bullet points instead of a table format, which is a small structural difference but deviates from the ground truth's presentation under strict evaluation. No factual errors.
