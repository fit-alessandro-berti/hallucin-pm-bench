9.5

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth answer in terms of verdict (“No”), rule-by-rule assessment, and specific justifications for each rule, especially the key violation (rule 3, NA occurs before RA is complete). However, there are very minor differences:

- The format is less formal/structured than the table in the ground truth.
- The ground truth answer explicitly mentions "Because rule 3 is violated, the overall trace is non-compliant," adding a final summary sentence absent in the LLM answer.

While these differences are minor and do not impact the substantive evaluation, the instruction is to be strict and deduct even for small omissions, so a 0.5-point deduction is applied.
