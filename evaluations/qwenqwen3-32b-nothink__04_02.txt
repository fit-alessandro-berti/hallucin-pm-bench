6.0

- R1: Correct (Compliant, justification matches).
- R2: Correct status (Violated), but justification is incorrect—the actual issue is Ship_Goods happens before new Manager_Approval, not after Change_Request or based merely on “last approval”—ambiguous, but partial credit.
- R3: Correct (Violated, with clear justification).
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable, appropriate justification).
- R5: Incorrect status (calls Compliant; should be Violated). This is a serious error—Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice happen before new Manager_Approval, so it clearly violates R5.
- R6: Correct (Compliant).

The overall result is marked appropriately as NON-COMPLIANT.

Major issue: R5 is incorrectly assessed as Compliant, a significant misinterpretation of the rule and trace, warranting a big penalty. The R2 justification is also imprecise. All other answers are correct and concise.

The answer demonstrates good structure and partial analysis, but the significant error on R5 and weakness in R2's reasoning limit the score to 6.0 due to the evaluation's strictness.
