6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Format Compliance**: The LLM answer follows the required structure (per-rule status in bold, ≤20-word justifications, all-caps overall result). No deductions here, but strictness applied to content.
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification accurate and concise (matches ground truth intent). Full credit.
- **R2**: Status correct (Violated). However, justification is imprecise and misleading—it incorrectly implies Ship_Goods occurred after the last approval (which was on 07-Mar), when it actually preceded it, failing the "after" condition entirely. Ground truth highlights the timeline mismatch correctly. Significant deduction for flawed reasoning (-1.5 points equivalent).
- **R3**: Status and justification both correct and precise. Full credit.
- **R4**: Status and justification both correct. Full credit.
- **R5**: Major error—status incorrectly marked Compliant, ignoring that Ship_Goods (and arguably Pay_Invoice) were further processing steps after Change_Request but before the new Manager_Approval, directly violating the "before any further processing step" clause. Ground truth correctly flags this. This is a critical content error, warranting heavy deduction (-2.0 points equivalent).
- **R6**: Status and justification both correct. Full credit.
- **Overall Result**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT). The conclusion holds despite missing R5 violation, but strict evaluation penalizes incomplete violation identification.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Starting from a base of 10, deductions for errors (especially R5's wrong status and R2's inaccurate justification) reduce score significantly. Minor positives (e.g., brevity) do not offset. Total reflects ~60% alignment with ground truth due to key discrepancies.
