The LLM answer correctly captures the core structure of the process without adding unmentioned elements (e.g., no extra timers, approvals, or parallel paths), accurately models the two exclusive gateways, the re-work loop back to "Initial Diagnosis" after failed confirmation, and stays under 40 lines with concise IDs. The flow logic matches the description: password reset bypasses diagnosis and goes to confirmation; other paths go through diagnosis, then either resolve or forward (leading to resolve), then confirmation, with loop or end. All seven mentioned activities are present with appropriate sequencing.

However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions are warranted for small but notable differences from the ground truth:

- **Task types invented**: Uses `<serviceTask>` for automated steps (classify, reset) and `<userTask>` for human steps (diagnosis, resolve, forward, confirm), adding implementation details not mentioned in the description or required by the prompt. Ground truth uses generic `<task>` for all, adhering strictly to "do not invent." This is a clear addition (-1.5 points).
- **Condition expressions invented and mismatched**: Introduces specific FEEL-like expressions (e.g., `${classification == "Password Reset"}`, `${resolved}`, `${confirmed}`, `${!confirmed}`) with unmentioned variables, diverging from the ground truth's simple, generic "yes"/"no" conditions. While the LLM's are logically defensible, they invent details not "exactly as stated," violating the no-invention rule (-1.0 point).
- **Name inaccuracies**: "Classify Ticket" slightly deviates from the description's "automatically classified by the system" (ground truth uses "Auto-Classification" for precision). Minor, but strictness requires deduction (-0.5 points).
- **Missing attributes and elements**: Lacks ground truth's `<?xml>` declaration, `targetNamespace`, process `name` and `isExecutable`, and descriptive `name` attributes on gateways/events/start/end. These are not strictly required by the prompt but create line-by-line differences (-0.5 points).
- **Minor sequencing/condition details**: One outgoing flow from gw1 lacks an explicit condition (uses default, which is valid BPMN but differs from ground truth's explicit "no"); gateway names absent (-0.5 points).

No major structural errors or hallucinations, so the score remains high despite deductions for fidelity to the ground truth's exact XML form.
