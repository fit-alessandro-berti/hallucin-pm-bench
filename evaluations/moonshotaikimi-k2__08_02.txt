6.0

**Assessment:**

- The LLM answer gives the correct answer for Q1 ("Yes") and provides a correct firing sequence for Q2.
- However, several points are lost for the following reasons:
  - The explanation is too brief, unclear, and informal ("markedy before T3 ever touches P2" is vague).
  - There are no intermediate markings or clear stepwise explanation as in the ground truth.
  - The LLM answer omits that after T5 fires, T3 becomes disabled because P2 is consumed.
  - The notation is less precise (no list of markings).
  - It does not explicitly observe that T5 can only fire while T3 has not occurred and that T3 is disabled after T5.

**Summary:**  
While the firing sequence given is minimal and matches the correct order, the lack of explicit state tracking and clear reasoning—as requested—results in a significant deduction. "Yes" alone for Q1 does not justify full points, and for Q2, the answer is correct in outcome but poor in process explanation.
