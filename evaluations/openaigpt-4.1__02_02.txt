The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content for all three questions: Q1 is "3"; Q2 lists the precise sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"; Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") alphabetically, one per line. Minor formatting differences (e.g., code block vs. markdown bullets) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as the prompt specifies content (activities, order, alphabetical listing) over presentation. No hallucinations, omissions, or inaccuracies.
