8.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate in verdict ("Non-compliant"), correctly identifies the exact same rule violations (2 and 3) with matching core reasoning, and appropriately addresses all rules as satisfied where applicable. Minor deductions for: (1) non-sequential rule ordering in justifications (2,3,1,4,5 vs. GT's strict 1-5 order, -0.5); (2) distance miscalculation in Rule 3 ("4" vs. GT's "3", despite equivalent intervening activities and same violation conclusion, -0.5); (3) lacking GT's exact phrasing/formatting ("**Rule X — Violated/Satisfied.**", "Justification" header, bolding, final summary sentence, -0.5). No other errors; structure remains numbered and cites rules as required.
