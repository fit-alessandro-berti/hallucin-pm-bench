8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with precise conditions and outcomes that align closely with the ground truth. It uses exact activity names and avoids standard loan terminology, as required. The required documents list is complete and matches all items, with no omissions or additions.

However, under strict evaluation:
- **Decision points (deductions for ~1.5 points total)**: 
  - Includes unnecessary step numbers (e.g., "Step 5"), which are not part of the ground truth summary or explicitly requested in the prompt—introduces extraneous process structure.
  - Omits contextual positioning (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), making the summary less precise about flow.
  - Minor phrasing variances: "differ by > 2 points" vs. ground truth's implied ">2 via 'else'"; "votes to approve or reject" vs. "votes **Approve** or **Reject**" (capitalization and bolding); adds unneeded parenthetical "(Only reached when amount ≥ €15,000)".
  - Formatting (e.g., bolded conditions, sub-bullets) deviates slightly from ground truth's concise, italicized style.
- **Required documents (deductions for ~0.5 points total)**:
  - Minor wording inconsistencies: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"—these are small but reflect inexact replication of ground truth phrasing.
  - Omits the ground truth's closing note on excluded documents (e.g., "No credit bureau report..."), though this is not strictly required by the prompt.
- No major errors, hallucinations, or omissions, but the cumulative small differences in phrasing, structure, and completeness reduce the score from a perfect 10.0.
