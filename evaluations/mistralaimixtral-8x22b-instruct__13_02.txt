**9.5**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the ground truth exactly in values, rounding, and calculations (deterministic full marks). Formatting is clear and precise.

For Q3 (≤100 words, met): Covers low-support/single-occurrence issue (explicitly references the 1-occurrence activity as "low-support"; ties to small sample), notes variance/instability (rare/infrequent leading to skewed metrics/overlooking patterns), and cautions over-generalisation (mislead if generalized; poor real-world applicability). Focuses aptly on performance/predictive analyses. Minor deduction (-0.5) for slightly more generic ML emphasis vs. ground truth's specific stats (e.g., cycle time, CI width/noise); lacks "single observation" phrasing explicitly, though strongly implied—strictness applied. No inventions; data-only.
