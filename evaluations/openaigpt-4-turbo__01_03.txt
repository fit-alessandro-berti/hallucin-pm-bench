**2.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Part (a) – Major Errors (Severe Deviation, ~40% of Score Penalty)**:
  - LLM incorrectly identifies **Tri-Color-Risk-Check** as a "decision point" (its first item), describing it merely as assigning a risk rating from inputs. Ground truth (GT) explicitly treats this as a step producing an outcome, **not** a decision/gate/branch. The true first decision is the **post-check conditional skip** (LLM's second item, which is partially accurate but renamed/verbose).
  - LLM lists **3 decision points** vs. GT's **2**, introducing an extraneous one.
  - TriVote description is close but imprecise: LLM uses vague "potential approvals... any two sufficient to proceed" vs. GT's exact "only when at least **two of the three approvers... record 'Approve'**". Misses quoting approvers precisely and rule phrasing.
  - Format: LLM verbose (not "one sentence each"); GT concise.

- **Part (b) – Critical Omissions (Severe Deviation, ~50% of Score Penalty)**:
  - LLM lists **only 5 documents** vs. GT's **9**, **completely omitting the 3 core inputs** to Tri-Color-Risk-Check (**Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow**), which appear explicitly before any conditional and are required "anywhere in the process".
  - Fails to distinguish **Offer Sheet 77** (first unsigned in step 7) from **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (step 8) as separate first appearances in GT.
  - Adds subjective qualifiers like "if necessary" for Deck Memo and "alongside the signed..." for ID Matrix, implying conditionality absent from task ("**all** documents... in the order they first appear").
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML), but incompleteness is disqualifying.

- **Overall**: ~80% deviation from GT in completeness/accuracy. Small errors (e.g., phrasing) compound with large ones (missing items, extra/wrong decision point). No credit for partial matches under utmost strictness.
