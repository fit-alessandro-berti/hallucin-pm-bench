4.0

The LLM answer gets the following:

- Correctly identifies #1 (Request_Documents) and #2 (Send_Closure_Letter), in the right order, with accurate waiting-time quotations.
- Incorrectly picks #3 (Initial_Screening, avg 2.1h, p95 5.6h) when, per the table and ground truth, the correct third-worst by waiting time is Assess_Liability (avg 7.8h, p95 16.4h).
- The recommended actions are somewhat generic; for Request_Documents and Send_Closure_Letter, they are plausible but less concrete or data-driven than those in the ground truth, and do not mention tested or estimated percentage reductions, weakening their data-driven aspect.
- For #3, the answer recommends action and cites throughput, which, per instructions, should not be mentioned. Also, the wrong activity is addressed.
- The memo contains a final sentence (“Addressing these bottlenecks...”) that is padding beyond strict instructions, but this is a minor fault relative to the above.

Scoring strictly (deducting heavily for the critical error in the third activity, as well as for the lack of rigor in the recommended actions):

- Identification and ranking: 2/3 correct (loses 3 pts for wrong #3)
- Quotation of figures: Mistaken activity in #3 means the third set of numbers is entirely wrong (another 1 pt off). Also, numbers for the first two are correct.
- Recommendations: Plausible, but much vaguer than the ground truth, and only loosely (not concretely/data-driven) promise 20%+ reductions (lose 0.5 pt per action).
- Extra content/out-of-scope material: Minor stray reference to throughput.

Thus, 4.0/10.0 is appropriate per the requested strictness.
