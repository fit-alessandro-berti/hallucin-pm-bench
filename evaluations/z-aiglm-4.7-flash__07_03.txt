The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact IDs, names, and gateway type transitions matching the XML diffs and ground truth content. No extraneous elements, guesses, or commentary added, fully complying with instructions on verifiable differences only.

Minor formatting deviations cause point loss under strict criteria:
- Headings use bold markdown (** **) instead of plain text verbatim as in ground truth and prompt presentation.
- List items lack leading "-" bullets present in ground truth.
- Second gateway line lacks padding spaces for alignment ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").

These are small but consistent visual/textual mismatches from ground truth, warranting deduction despite perfect semantics (full credit would require exact output replication).
