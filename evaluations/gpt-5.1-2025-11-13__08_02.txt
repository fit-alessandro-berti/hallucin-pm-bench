The LLM answer fundamentally misinterprets the question, incorrectly stating "No" for Q1 when the ground truth is "Yes." Its Q2 explanation accurately describes a sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) that enables T5 to fire before T3—directly supporting the "yes" case—but then erroneously concludes the opposite ("T5 can never be forced to occur before T3"), confusing possibility with necessity. This core reversal of logic, despite partial grasp of the net's behavior, warrants severe deduction. No markings or explicit sequence list provided, violating the bonus format. Word limit adhered, but content is substantively flawed.
