The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides a precise justification focused on the counterexamples (C002 and C004), directly disproving the "always" claim with relevant sequences from the log. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core conclusion and evidence for inaccuracies. Minor deductions for not including a comprehensive case-by-case analysis (e.g., omitting C001 and C003 where the rule holds) and lacking the structured table format, which adds thoroughness but is not strictly required by the task. No factual errors.
