The LLM answer perfectly matches all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable), overall result, and all-caps formatting. Justifications are factually accurate, ≤20 words each, and semantically align with the ground truth (e.g., R2 correctly identifies pre-approval timing violation for expedited rule; R5 notes post-change steps before new approval). Minor deductions for non-identical wording (e.g., R2 omits explicit dates/2-day calc; wordier R4/R1; no overall violation list) and list vs. table format, per strict criteria.
