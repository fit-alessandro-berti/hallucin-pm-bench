**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth)
- **Correctness of "Yes" and core path**: Matches perfectly (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5 enables T5 without prior T3 via shortcut). +3.0 points.
- **Firing sequence**: Major difference. LLM gives shortest prefix to T5 (length 4), ground truth gives full sequence including T6 → T3 (length 6) to explicitly demonstrate T5 *before* T3 with both firing. LLM omits T6/T3. -2.0 points.
- **Claimed "shortest"**: LLM asserts length 4 is minimal; ground truth asserts length 6 is minimal (with lower bound 4 + extras for T3 via loop). Direct contradiction. -1.5 points.
- **Explanation**: LLM emphasizes permanent bypass ("T3 never involved", "unnecessary"); ground truth explains temporary bypass + feedback loop re-enables T3 after T5 ("T6 reinjects... re-enabling T3"). LLM misses loop's role. -1.0 points.
- **Format/details**: LLM's table/markings nice but stops at pf=1; ground truth inline markings through T3, "no shorter" proof. Minor polish but content gap. -0.5 points.

Total reflects substantial content divergence despite shared yes/core logic; strictness docks for non-matching sequence, length claim, and incomplete ordering demo.
