9.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth: it correctly recognizes that the absence of event data (only column headers, no timestamps or rows) makes the computation of the requested metrics impossible. It precisely explains why, mentions both the missing per-event durations and the lack of start/complete times, and avoids guessing or using outside facts.

The only, very minor, shortcoming is the slight excess in verbosity in point 2 (somewhat redundant restatement about standard deviation and CI). The ground truth answer is slightly more concise and direct ("Impossibleâ€”..."). A stricter reviewer might deduct half a point for not matching the exact brevity and focus. Otherwise, the answer is technically and factually correct, with no material mistakes.

Therefore, a strict score: **9.5**.
