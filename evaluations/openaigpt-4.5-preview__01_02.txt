The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, closely mirroring the ground truth in structure, content, and terminology while adhering to the prompt's instructions. All decision points are correctly identified and described without introducing extraneous loan terminology. The required documents list is complete and uses exact activity names.

Minor deductions for small phrasing discrepancies in the documents section (e.g., including "single" in "single pay-stub or tax slip" where GT uses "pay-stub/tax slip"; adding "old" in "≤ 3 months old" vs. GT's "≤ 3 months"; retaining "template" in CIS where GT omits it) and slight variations in decision point positioning (e.g., explicit "proceed to NFC" vs. GT's "branch after"; adding "(only for amounts ≥ €15 000)" note not in GT). Formatting differences (bullets vs. numbering) are negligible but noted under strict evaluation. No major errors or omissions.
