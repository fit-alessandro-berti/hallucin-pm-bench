8.3

**Justification:**

The LLM answer is largely accurate and uses (almost) only the required terminology and sequence. It faithfully lists all necessary decision points, in the correct order, and gives clear explanations matching the process. The list of required documents is correct and complete, matching the ground truth.

**Deductions:**

- **Location/context of steps**: The LLM answer adds "Proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" language under Underwriter Alignment Gate, which is helpful and correct—but it omits stating where the Underwriter Alignment Gate happens (i.e., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"), though this is a minor detail.
- **Wording differences**: The requirement to use the *exact* activity names is mostly upheld, but the LLM introduces "Proceed to..." for transitions instead of simply "continue" or the specific instruction "send to." This is a minimal deviation, but with strict grading should cost points.
- **Details for documents**: In the required documents, the LLM answer repeats the descriptive text for "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" and "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" (instead of "(pay-stub/tax slip)"), which is trivially different; similarly, "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" versus just "CIS". These are minor but exist.
- **Extra explanations**: The LLM omits the final note from the ground truth answer: (“No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed”). This is a small omission, but since the prompt asks for "every required document," mentioning the absence of non-required docs is arguably part of being thorough.

**Summary:**  
It is accurate and uses the correct terminology, but a few subtle differences, extra wording, and omission of the explicit point about excluded documents, mean it cannot be awarded a 9 or 10. Strictly, these small errors together justify a score of 8.3.
