3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment based on fidelity to the ground truth answer, penalizing all deviations heavily as per instructions. The LLM answer attempts to map the source text into a RACI table and adheres to the vocabulary mandate (e.g., correctly uses "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst" without substitutions). However, it diverges substantially in structure, content, and accuracy, leading to major point deductions:

- **Structural Differences (Heavy Penalty: -3.0 points)**: The LLM answer has 8 rows/activities (including an invented #8 for notification, which is not in the source text or ground truth) vs. the ground truth's precise 6 rows that directly map the source steps without additions or splits. It includes an unnecessary "#" column and leaves cells blank (implying absence) instead of explicitly assigning all roles as in the ground truth. No legend is provided, unlike the ground truth's clear "Legend" row. Activity names are wordier and less standardized (e.g., "Receive customer transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; added details like "after required approvals" or "on sender and beneficiary" introduce unsubstantiated expansions).

- **Role Differences (Heavy Penalty: -2.0 points)**: The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" column entirely, using only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support. This violates the intent of a complete RACI by not accounting for the accountability layer evident in the ground truth (e.g., Operations Manager as **A** across tasks). While the prompt mandates only specific substitutions and doesn't explicitly prohibit additional roles, the ground truth includes it as essential for full coverage, making the LLM's table incomplete.

- **RACI Assignments (Heavy Penalty: -1.5 points)**: Assignments differ in nearly every row, often incorrectly:
  - Row 1: LLM assigns R/A to Transaction Analyst (overloading responsibility and accountability on the analyst); ground truth separates R (Transaction Analyst) from A (Operations Manager) and adds I/C for others.
  - Row 2: Partial match (R for Transaction Analyst, A for Regulatory Liaison), but misses I (Operations Manager) and C (IT Support).
  - Row 3: LLM gives R/A solely to Regulatory Liaison; ground truth splits R (Regulatory Liaison) from A (Operations Manager), with C/I for others.
  - Row 4: LLM incorrectly assigns I to Transaction Analyst (source text has no clerk involvement in approval) and R/A to Regulatory Liaison; ground truth uses C for Transaction Analyst, R for Regulatory Liaison, A for Operations Manager.
  - Row 5: Partial similarity (R/A for Transaction Analyst, I for Regulatory Liaison), but ground truth adjusts to R (Transaction Analyst), A (Operations Manager), and adds C (IT Support); LLM separates release from SWIFT/archiving, mismapping source step 5.
  - Rows 6-8: LLM splits source steps 5-6 into three rows (including non-source notification), assigning e.g., C/I/R/A variably; ground truth consolidates into "Release Payment" (with IT C) and "Archive Record" (IT R, Operations Manager A, others C/I), better aligning without extras.
  These mismatches fail to "cover every task" accurately per the source, with small errors (e.g., I vs. C for Transaction Analyst in approval) compounding to show poor mapping.

- **Minor Formatting/Compliance Issues (Minor Penalty: -0.5 points, but strict deduction)**: No bolding for R/A as in ground truth (which emphasizes key roles). The table is in Markdown but lacks the ground truth's header "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" and post-table notes confirming vocabulary use. While mandated terms are followed, the overall output doesn't "organise the RACI matrix clearly" to match the reference.

Base score starts at 10.0 for using mandated vocabulary and Markdown format, but cumulative differences (especially in completeness and accuracy) reduce it to 3.5. The LLM answer is a rough approximation but introduces errors/omissions that prevent it from being a reliable match.
