The LLM answer is concise and correct in its main conclusion: the average cycle time cannot be determined because of missing timestamps or duration data. However, it is slightly less informative than the ground truth, as it omits explicit mention that only event counts are provided and does not clarify "start-to-completion intervals are absent." For maximal strictness, per instructions, this lack of specificity warrants a full point deduction.
