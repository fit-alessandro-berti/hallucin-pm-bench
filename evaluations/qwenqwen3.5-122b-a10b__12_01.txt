The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides accurate evidence from Cases 1001 and 1003 showing the reversed order (Update_Inventory before Authorize_Refund), directly contradicting the claim. This is sufficient to disprove the fact, with precise timestamps for ordering and a concise structure matching the user request.

However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for a significant omission: it completely ignores Case 1002, where Update_Inventory is absent (making "always" false regardless of order), which the ground truth explicitly cites as a key disproof. The phrasing "in the cases where both activities occur" narrows scope unnecessarily without addressing all cases or the absence explicitly. Minor differences in structure (no "Short verdict" header, timestamps vs. line numbers) and lack of the ground truth's comprehensive conclusion ("in none of the three cases") further deduct points, though the core verdict and cited evidence are strong.
