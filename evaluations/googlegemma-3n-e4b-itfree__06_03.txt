9.0

The LLM answer is concise and correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks within Process B, matching the structure and content of the ground truth answer. It accurately numbers the sets and lists the appropriate tasks grouped by each parallel split. However, it omits explicit reference to the parallel block order (e.g., "first parallel block", "second parallel block") and does not add the clarifying statement that no other tasks can run in parallel as seen in the ground truth. These minor omissions warrant a small penalty for strictness, leading to a score of 9.0.
