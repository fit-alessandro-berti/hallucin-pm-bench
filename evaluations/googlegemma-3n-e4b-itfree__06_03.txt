The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks in the specified order, fully aligning with the core content of the ground truth. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: lack of descriptive labels (e.g., "first parallel block"), use of commas instead of the ‖ symbol, absence of markdown formatting (bold, backticks), no introductory structure, and omission of the explicit closing statement confirming no other parallels—though these do not alter factual accuracy or completeness per the prompt.
