8.5

- **Strengths (full credit on content):** All answers are factually correct: 3 cases identified accurately (same set), correct predecessor (Pack_Items for C456 Ship_Order), correct unique activity (Cancel_Order).
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness):** 
  - Format mismatch: Uses numbered **1./2./3.** bullets vs ground truth's **A1/A2/A3** bullets; dash (-) vs asterisk (*).
  - Q1: Extra "distinct" phrasing, cases listed in different order (C456/C123/C789 vs C123/C456/C789) – small error but strict loss.
  - Q2/Q3: Not concise; adds full rephrasing/sentences ("For C456, the activity immediately preceding **Ship_Order** is **Pack_Items**"; "**Cancel_Order** appears exactly once") vs ground truth's minimal "Pack_Items" / "Cancel_Order".
  - Violates "concise, bullet-point answers only" by verbosity; no escaping like Pack\_Items.
- **Overall:** Perfect accuracy but penalized heavily for presentation/conciseness/format differences per strict criteria.
