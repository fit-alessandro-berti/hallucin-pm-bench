1.0

The provided LLM answer fails to deliver any BPMN 2.0 XML output, instead consisting entirely of unstructured, repetitive internal reasoning and analysis without producing the required single `<definitions> … </definitions>` block. This violates the core instruction to "Translate it into BPMN 2.0 XML exactly as stated" and "Output a single `<definitions> … </definitions>` block, ≤ 40 lines." There is zero structural or content match to the ground truth, which includes specific elements like a start event, seven named tasks, three exclusive gateways (despite the prompt's mention of two), sequence flows with conditions, and an end event forming the exact process flow (e.g., gw1 for classification, gw2 for internal resolution vs. forward, gw3 for customer confirmation with loop back, and convergence on "Resolve Issue" and "Confirm with Customer"). The absence of any XML elements, IDs (e.g., no t1, gw1), gateways, tasks, or flows results in complete deviation, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
