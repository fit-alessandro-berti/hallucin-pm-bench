9.0

The LLM answer correctly identified the two pairs of tasks that may execute in parallel and listed them in the required format and (almost) correct order. However, there is a small penalty for not fully matching the ground truth formatting, specifically:

- The ground truth uses extra spaces for alignment between task names (e.g., "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"), whereas the LLM answer collapses whitespace ("Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines"), making it slightly less legible and not an exact match.
- The pair ordering within each line is correct (alphabetical within the pair), as is the overall ordering (Create_Documentation... appears before Procure_Materials...).
- The output is one pair per line as required.

Because the answer is complete, correct, and unambiguous but slightly off in formatting detail, this answer deserves a 9.0. If *every* detail (including spacing) had matched, it would be a 10.
