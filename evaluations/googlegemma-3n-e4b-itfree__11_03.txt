### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer identifies the correct three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment), aligning with the ground truth's selection based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times. It uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations and structures the response as memo text, meeting basic formatting requirements. However, it incurs severe penalties for fundamental errors in quantification and recommendations:

- **Quantification of SLA breaches**: Catastrophic mismatch. The ground truth correctly uses Avg_Throughput_Time vs. Target_SLA (e.g., Legal: +300s, Risk: +300s, Credit: +60s) and notes waiting times separately. The LLM incorrectly applies Avg_Waiting_Time against the SLA (e.g., Legal waiting 600s vs. 600s SLA, claiming exceedance by implication but quantifying nothing accurately; Credit waiting 200s "falling short" of 240s, inverting the breach direction). No excesses are properly calculated or stated, violating the prompt's data-grounding rule and core memo objective. This alone warrants a >50% deduction.

- **Recommendations**: Partially compliant in format but lacks concreteness and data-driven specificity. The ground truth provides targeted, actionable steps (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under â‚¬25k") tied implicitly to data patterns. The LLM's are vague and generic (e.g., "implement a process review," "investigate factors," "analyze the volume"), with only Risk weakly referencing case count (480). No true data linkage (e.g., no throughput/waiting metrics informing actions), resulting in a loose fit to the "concrete, data-driven" requirement.

- **Other issues**: Minor inventions (e.g., date "October 26, 2023") and word count (~220 vs. ~150 target) add deductions. Intro analysis is superficial and doesn't "ground every sentence in the data" as strictly as the ground truth (e.g., no total cases reference, though ground truth invents "4 805"). Overall fidelity is low due to metric confusion, eroding the memo's analytical value.
