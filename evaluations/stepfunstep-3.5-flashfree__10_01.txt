**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary (perfect, +2.0)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Matches ground truth and prompt strictly.
- **Structure (+1.0)**: Correct rows (6 activities), columns (4 roles), table format. No extra tasks/roles/columns.
- **RACI Content (major failures, -5.8 total deduction)**:
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | All rows | Missing C/I assignments (e.g., GT has CO C/FC I/IT I for Receive Application; LLM blanks = "no involvement"). Every row incomplete. |
  | KYC Review | LLM: CO **R/A**; GT: CO **R**, AM **A**, FC C, IT I. Wrong split, missing others. |
  | Order Vetting | Partial AM **R/A**, but missing CO C/FC I/IT I. |
  | Payment Clearance | LLM: FC **R/A**; GT: FC **R**, AM **A**, CO C, IT I. Wrong split, missing others. |
  | Record Update | LLM: IT **R/A**; GT: IT **R**, AM C, FC C, CO I. Wrong split (extra A), missing others. |
  | Receive/Notify | Partial AM **R/A**, but missing C/I for others. |
  - No row fully matches GT cells. LLM oversimplifies to "diagonal R/A + blanks" (violates full RACI; ignores inferred consultations/informations from process flow). GT has precise one R per row, AM A where non-primary.
- **Formatting/Header/Details (-1.0)**: Extra title, key (incomplete, omits C/I), role abbrevs "(AM)", centered columns, "R/A" (no spaces/bold as **R / A**). GT plain headers, selective bolds, no extras.
- **Overall Correctness per Rubric (partial)**: Synonyms ✓, one R-ish per row ✓, AM A "where appropriate" (but over-applied/misplaced). Fails full narrative reflection (e.g., secondary roles). Unwarranted key/title.

Total reflects ~30-40% alignment (terms/structure good, content ~50% wrong). Strict penalty for all cell differences.
