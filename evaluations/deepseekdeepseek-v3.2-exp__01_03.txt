4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects strict adherence to the ground truth, penalizing additions, omissions, and inaccuracies as significant deviations. Part (a) loses major points for fabricating an extra "decision point" (the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome itself is a step, not a gate or conditional branch; only the post-check skip and TriVote qualify, per the process). The summaries for the actual two points are mostly accurate but not identical in phrasing (e.g., "produces a single risk rating" vs. ground truth's focus on the bypass rule; "grant their approval" vs. "record 'Approve'"). Part (b) loses points for omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (explicitly named in step 8, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7), resulting in only 8 items instead of 9, and a subtly incorrect order (ID Matrix Declaration appears after Signed Offer Sheet 77 in step 8's document list). Parenthetical descriptions (e.g., "(Application)") are unnecessary additions not in the ground truth. No hallucinations of absent elements (e.g., KYC) occurred, which prevents a lower score, but the errors still indicate incomplete fidelity to the process description.
