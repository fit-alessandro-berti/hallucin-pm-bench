The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" without any forbidden terms, and it avoids introducing extra tasks or roles. The Responsible (R) assignments align with the explicit handlers in the process narrative (one R per activity, matching AM for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Notify Customer, CO for KYC Review, FC for Payment Clearance, and IT for Record Update). However, it significantly deviates from the ground truth in several strict aspects: (1) It omits Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) designations entirely, using only R and dashes, whereas the ground truth provides a full RACI with nuanced multi-role assignments (e.g., AM as R/A for multiple activities, C and I across roles like CO/FC/IT for KYC Review); (2) Bold formatting and header styles differ (e.g., LLM uses full role names with abbreviations and bolded activities, ground truth uses shorter headers and selective bolding on key cells); (3) Unwarranted additions include an introductory sentence, a legend (not present in ground truth), bolded "Order-to-Cash" (not in prompt), and an offer for further visualization/export, violating the "no unwarranted content" criterion. These omissions and extras represent major incompleteness and non-adherence to the detailed ground truth structure, warranting substantial point deduction under strict evaluation.
