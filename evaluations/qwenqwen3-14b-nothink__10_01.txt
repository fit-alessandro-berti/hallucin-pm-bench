4.0

**Rationale:**

- **Terminology:** The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy: it uses “KYC Review,” “Order Vetting,” and “Payment Clearance,” never mentions the forbidden terms, and uses the correct spelling/capitalization. (No points lost here.)
- **Structure:** A RACI matrix is presented with activities as rows and roles as columns.
- **Major Errors:**
  - **RACI assignments are incomplete and inaccurate:** The LLM answer marks only one “R” (Responsible) per activity with dashes elsewhere for each row. It does not use “A” (Accountable), “C” (Consulted), or “I” (Informed) anywhere in the body of the matrix, **despite these being present in the expected answer**. The legend claims only “R” is used, which is a significant factual error.
  - The **ground truth** shows multiple assignments per task—Account Manager is often both Responsible and Accountable (“R / A”), and other roles are Consulted or Informed. The answer lacks these important distinctions and thus **misrepresents the process responsibility structure**.
- **Formatting:** The LLM answer introduces a legend—though not necessary, this is harmless and not penalized. The offer to export/visualize is superfluous, but not penalized.

**Summary of deduction:**
- -1.0: Fails to use multiple RACI assignments for a given task.
- -1.5: Fails to use “A”, “C”, “I” at all, omitting the full RACI breakdown.
- -1.5: For each activity, actual team involvement is drastically underrepresented; this is a core failing in a process RACI.

**Final:** 4.0 (meets the terminology policy but fails on structural and substantive correctness of RACI assignment).
