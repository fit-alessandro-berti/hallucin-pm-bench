The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, structure, and ordering for all three questions. Q1 is correct (3 distinct cases: C001, C002, C003). Q2 correctly lists the sequence for C002 without omissions or additions. Q3 accurately identifies the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock), listed one per line and alphabetically ordered, with no extras or errors. Minor formatting differences (e.g., lack of dashes or backslashes) do not affect precision.
