The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with precise IDs, names, and gateway type shifts (exclusive → parallel for both gateways), matching the ground truth content verbatim. However, it deducts points for minor formatting deviations: headings prefixed with "-" (not verbatim as specified), and list items lacking the "- " bullet points used in the ground truth, resulting in a non-identical structure despite semantic accuracy.
