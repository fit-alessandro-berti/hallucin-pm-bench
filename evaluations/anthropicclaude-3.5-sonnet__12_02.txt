The LLM answer correctly identifies **No** as the response and provides a accurate justification that matches the ground truth in core content (citing the same counterexamples in C003 with lines 6-7 showing Validate_Payment before Receive_Order, and C005 with line 11 lacking any Receive_Order). However, minor deductions apply for stylistic differences: the justification is in a single paragraph rather than bulleted list, includes extraneous timestamp details (not in ground truth), and phrases C005 as "without any preceding Receive_Order activity" instead of the more explicit "never contains *Receive_Order* at all," slightly reducing precision under strict evaluation.
