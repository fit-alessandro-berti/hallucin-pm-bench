The LLM answer demonstrates partial comprehension of the requirements but has several significant issues in comparison to the ground truth:

**Positives:**
- The mandated terms "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst" are used exclusively (no forbidden synonyms appear; this is correctly followed).
- The LLM put the RACI matrix in markdown and attempted to cover all meaningful process steps.

**Negatives:**
- The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" role, which is present (and designated as "Accountable" in most tasks) in the ground truth. This is a major process documentation error; every RACI table must specify an Accountable party. In the LLM answer, most tasks lack an Accountable (shown by dashes), which is a structural flaw and not strictly correct RACI formatting.
- For many steps, "Accountable" is left blank—a direct violation of one of the most fundamental RACI principles (every activity must have one, and only one, Accountable).
- Several "Consulted" and "Informed" assignments are missing, compared to the more rigorous allocations in the ground truth answer. For example, Transaction Analyst and Regulatory Liaison are never "Consulted" or "Informed" in the LLM answer.
- The activities are not mapped to the exact enforced synonyms for every activity—for example, instead of "Receive Payment Instruction," the LLM writes "Logs transfer instruction in system," which is not the mapped/mandated name from the ground truth.
- There are unmandated activities (e.g., "Notifies Regulatory Liaison of archived transaction"), which is a subtly different framing from strictly mapping the informal steps to the mandated activities.
- Structurally, the LLM answer omits a "Legend," which is present in the ground truth for clarity.

Given these issues:
- Major deduction for omission of "Accountable" (very significant in process documentation).
- Large deduction for lack of role ("Operations Manager") present in ground truth.
- Additional loss for not matching enforced task descriptions/terminology precisely.
- Medium deduction for omitting some C/I assignments and process structure nuances.

**Score: 4.0** (Some understanding and usage of enforced vocabulary, but significant failures in RACI completeness, role inclusion, and task/activity naming have severe impact.)
