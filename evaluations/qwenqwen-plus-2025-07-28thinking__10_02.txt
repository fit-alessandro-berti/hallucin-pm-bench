3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment based on direct comparison to the ground truth answer. While the LLM answer adheres to the vocabulary mandate (correctly using "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst" without substitutions or additions beyond "IT Support" from the source text), it exhibits significant deviations in structure, task coverage, and RACI assignments, warranting substantial point deductions under the utmost strictness guideline. Below is a breakdown of key differences:

#### 1. **Structure and Format (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**
   - **Columns/Roles**: LLM uses a standard RACI format (Task | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed), which is logical but does not match the ground truth's role-based columns (Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | Operations Manager | IT Support) with letters (R/A/C/I) placed in cells. The LLM omits "Operations Manager" entirely, treating accountability sparsely or leaving cells blank, while the ground truth integrates it as the primary Accountable role across tasks. This creates a fundamentally different matrix layout and role distribution.
   - **Legend**: LLM lacks any legend (e.g., explaining R/A/C/I), whereas the ground truth includes one explicitly. Markdown is used correctly in both, but the ground truth's formatting (e.g., bolding for R/A in some cells, though not consistent) adds precision.
   - **Overall Clarity**: LLM's empty cells ("—") imply sparsity but fail to populate consulted/informed roles as comprehensively as the ground truth, reducing usability.

#### 2. **Task Coverage and Mapping (Major Deduction: -2.5 points)**
   - **Number and Naming of Tasks**: LLM identifies 8 tasks, including splitting "ensures SWIFT message transmission" and "notifies Regulatory Liaison" as separate (not in source text as distinct steps) and combining "receives and logs" into just "Logs transfer instruction in system" (omitting explicit "Receive"). Ground truth has exactly 6 tasks, directly mapping source steps without splitting or adding (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" explicitly, "Archive Record" combines archiving and implicit notification without a separate "Notifies" row). LLM's "Performs KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" adds unnecessary detail from the source, while ground truth uses concise "KYC Review" per mandate.
   - **Omissions/Substitutions**: LLM misses a distinct "Receive" step (source text step 1), treats SWIFT sending as a separate task (part of step 5), and adds a notification task (from step 6). Ground truth maps every source step without omissions, ensuring no extra or fragmented tasks. This results in incomplete fidelity to the informal description.

#### 3. **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -1.0 points)**
   - Assignments diverge entirely:
     - E.g., "Screen Against Sanctions List": LLM assigns only Responsible to Transaction Analyst (blanks elsewhere); ground truth has R (Transaction Analyst), A (Regulatory Liaison), I (Operations Manager), C (IT Support).
     - "KYC Review": LLM has Responsible and Accountable both to Regulatory Liaison (overloading); ground truth distributes as C (Transaction Analyst), R (Regulatory Liaison), A (Operations Manager), I (IT Support).
     - "Approve High-Risk Transactions": LLM has only Accountable to Regulatory Liaison; ground truth has C/R/A/I across roles.
     - Similar mismatches for Release, Archive, etc. LLM underutilizes Consulted/Informed, leaving most blank, while ground truth ensures balanced distribution without blanks.
   - No evidence of consulting/informing across roles in LLM (e.g., no "I" for Regulatory Liaison in early tasks), contrasting ground truth's interconnected assignments.

#### Positive Aspects (Partial Credit: +3.0 baseline before deductions)
   - **Vocabulary Adherence**: Perfect match—no use of forbidden terms like "Customer Due Diligence" or "Compliance Officer"; sticks strictly to mandated phrasing.
   - **Source Text Fidelity**: Covers core steps (logging/screening/KYC/approve/release/SWIFT/archive/notification) without inventing unsubstantiated content, though fragmented.
   - **Markdown Table**: Clean and readable, no formatting errors.

#### Overall Strictness Application
- Small errors (e.g., extra phrasing in task names, blank cells) compound with major ones (structure, omissions, mismatched assignments), leading to a low score. The LLM answer is a reasonable but incomplete RACI attempt that does not align closely enough with the ground truth's comprehensive, role-distributed matrix. A score above 5.0 would require near-identical task mapping and assignments, which is absent here.
