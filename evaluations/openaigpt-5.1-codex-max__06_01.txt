The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can run in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), uses one pair per line, and follows the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` with appropriate spacing around the em dash on both lines. It ignores Process A as instructed and includes no extraneous content.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for small formatting differences versus ground truth:
- Lacks the markdown code block (```) enclosing the output.
- Second line lacks the extra padding spaces ("     ") after "Procure_Materials" for visual/column alignment of the em dash (ground truth has ~4-5 extra spaces to align with first line in monospace font).

These are small whitespace and presentation issues, but per instructions, they warrant significant point loss despite perfect functional accuracy. No content, logic, or completeness errors.
