The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid, accurate justification by citing the key counterexample in case C003 (lines 6 and 7), which directly disproves the "always follows" claim. However, it is incomplete compared to the ground truth, as it omits the additional counterexample in case C005 (lines 11-12), where Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order, further strengthening the disproof. Under utmost strictness, this omission of a significant counterexample warrants a deduction, though the core response remains logically sound and adheres to the prompt's format (Yes/No followed by one-paragraph justification with citations).
