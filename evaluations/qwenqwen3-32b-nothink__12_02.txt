The LLM correctly answers “No” and accurately analyzes lines 6–7 (case C003), matching the first counterexample from the ground truth. However, it does not mention case C005, in which *Validate_Payment* occurs (line 11) but *Receive_Order* never occurs at all—an additional counterexample explicitly required by the ground truth.

This omission reflects a nontrivial difference: failing to cite all counterexamples in the brief log, especially when the prompt calls for maximal strictness and explicit citation of evidence. Thus, despite sound logic and clear reference to one relevant case, the response loses a significant portion of points for incomplete analysis.
