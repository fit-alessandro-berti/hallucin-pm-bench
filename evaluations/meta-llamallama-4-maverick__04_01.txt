8.2

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and the specific violations of Rules 2 and 3, matching the ground truth's core conclusion and citations. It also accurately assesses Rules 1, 4, and 5 as satisfied. However, significant deductions are warranted for the following differences under strict evaluation:

- **Format deviation (major impact, -1.0)**: The response includes extensive preliminary analysis with headings and subpoints before the required "Non-compliant" followed by a numbered justification. The ground truth integrates the justification directly and comprehensively covers all rules in a structured, numbered list (1-5). The LLM's justification only numbers the violations (1-2), omitting full coverage of satisfied rules, which partially mismatches the expected "numbered justification that cites the relevant rules."

- **Factual error in Rule 3 distance (moderate impact, -0.5)**: States "distance of 4 from `Goods_Received`," while the ground truth specifies "distance = 3" (aligning with intervening events: 7, 8, 9). This numerical discrepancy, though not altering the violation conclusion, is a small but precise error requiring point loss per instructions.

- **Minor wording and completeness issues (minor impact, -0.3)**: In Rule 4, the LLM incorrectly implies the Intern activity is immediately after the CFO's by focusing only on Event #4, without noting the full gap (Events 4-6 intervene), unlike the ground truth's explicit clarification. Additionally, the conclusion uses inconsistent capitalization ("**Non-compliant**" vs. ground truth's "Non-compliant" and "**NON-COMPLIANT**") and lacks the ground truth's summary rationale ("Because at least one rule is violated").

These issues reflect incomplete adherence to the prompt's format and minor inaccuracies, preventing a perfect score despite strong overall alignment.
