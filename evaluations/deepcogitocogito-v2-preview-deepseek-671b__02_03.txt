The LLM answer is substantively perfect, matching the ground truth exactly in content for all three questions (distinct cases, preceding activity, and unique activity). However, it violates the prompt's strict instruction for "concise, bullet-point answers only" by including extensive explanatory reasoning before the summary bullets, which introduces unnecessary verbosity. Under utmost strictness, this format deviation warrants a minor deduction (0.5 points), as it represents a small but clear non-compliance with the response guidelines. No factual errors or other differences exist.
