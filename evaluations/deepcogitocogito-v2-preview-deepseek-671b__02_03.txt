9.0

- The LLM answer is correct in all points, giving exactly the right responses for each question. 
- However, it fails to follow the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction; instead, it shows work, commentary, and labels before giving the final, concise summary. This is a presentation flaw: while the answer content is fully correct at the end, the form does not respect the requested brevity and bullet-point constraint.
- Thus, the score is reduced by one full point for not following explicit output formatting.
