8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and summarizes all required changes under the exact headings, with no omissions, additions, or misinterpretations of the BPMN XML differences (e.g., accurate detection of added tasks like `Task_VerifyIdentity`, removed `Task_RejectLoan`, and the exclusive-to-inclusive gateway shift). It ignores irrelevant aspects like name changes (e.g., "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan") as instructed.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting and structure (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: Uses bullet points instead of numbered lists; presents IDs before names (e.g., "`Task_VerifyIdentity` (Verify Identity)") while ground truth reverses this (name bolded first, then `(ID)`); plain headings without markdown bolding or overall header; lacks the closing note "(No other additions...)".
- **Phrasing and detail (minor deduction: -0.5 points)**: Gateway description uses full XML tag names (`exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`) instead of semantic terms ("exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)"); includes unrequested extra explanation ("semantic change from mutually exclusive paths..."), which deviates from strict summarization; omits explicit references to "v1" and "v2".

These are small but consistent differences in presentation and precision, warranting a significant but not catastrophic loss from a perfect 10.0. Core factual accuracy remains high (95%+ match).
