8.0

**Justification:**
The LLM answer is strong, but it is missing two important points found in the ground truth answer:

1. **Feasibility of T3 after T5:** The LLM gives the sequence T1, T2b, T4, T5, correctly showing T5 can fire before T3. However, it does **not** demonstrate that T3 can later fire after T5 by including the necessary transitions T6 and T3. The ground truth explicitly demonstrates that after T5, T6 can fire (to enable pc), then T3, ensuring T3 still can be fired after T5, which is a requirement in the prompt ("before" expresses relative ordering, not strict prevention). The LLM only stops after T5 and doesn't prove that T3 can still follow.

2. **Sequence completeness:** The ground truth answer finishes by displaying the full minimal complete path: T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3, and justifies why this is minimal, which is more rigorous and ensures that the answer is not just about immediate possibility but about full reachability.

3. **Explanatory completeness:** While the LLM explains the marking progress and why its sequence works for T5 before T3, it does not explicitly confirm that T3 is possible after T5, and makes a vague reference that "T3 is not enabled because pc is not marked" without explaining the mechanism for re-enabling pc.

**Small errors or omissions:**
- Does not clarify that T3 can be enabled later by way of the feedback (T6), which is crucial for full correctness.
- The LLM did not clearly address that a full sequence with T3 after T5 is possible and minimal (per the prompt, it's not strictly necessary to show T3 after T5 unless there was ambiguity, but the ground truth does explain this rigorously).
- LLM lacks the formal notation at the end that the ground truth gives (〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉).

**Final score — 8.0:**  
- The answer is logically correct and demonstrates the key idea ("shortcut" allows T5 before T3), but is lacking in full rigor and completeness required for maximal points per instructions.
