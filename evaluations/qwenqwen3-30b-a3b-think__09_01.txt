10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct and essentially matches the ground truth both in content and reasoning:

- It clearly states the average cycle time cannot be derived from the provided data.
- It gives a correct explanation: time fields were redacted, making calculation impossible.
- The answer avoids fabrication and reasoning errors.
- It is faithful to instruction to only answer if data supports it.

There are no errors—either substantial or minor—when compared to the ground truth provided. This merits the maximum score.
