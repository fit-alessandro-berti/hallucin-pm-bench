The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth on questions 1 and 2, with exact frequencies and percentages correctly calculated and rounded. For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (89 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue ("only one occurrence"), highlights instability/reliability risks ("lack statistical reliability"; "no insight into... typical duration"), and cautions against over-generalization ("Generalizing from this slice could lead to..."), aligning closely with the required elements without deviations, inventions, or errors.
