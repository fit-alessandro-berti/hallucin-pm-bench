3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth and prompt requirements, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key failures include:

- **Activity Identification (Major Error, -3.0 points)**: Prompt requires the *three worst-performing* based *jointly* on SLA breaches *and* high waiting times. Ground truth correctly selects Legal Approval (+300s breach, 600s wait), Risk Review (+300s breach, 480s wait), and Credit Assessment (+60s breach, 200s wait)—the clear top offenders by throughput excess and wait volume. LLM incorrectly includes Receive Application (45s throughput < 60s SLA; only 10s wait—it's performing *well*, not breaching). This misses the worst (Legal Approval) and fabricates a non-issue as "worst," violating data-grounding rules. Only 2/3 activities match, but the error is fundamental.

- **SLA Quantification (Partial Error, -1.5 points)**: Ground truth precisely states excesses (e.g., "+300 s"). LLM correctly quantifies Risk Review (+300s) and Credit Assessment (+60s) but errs on Receive Application, falsely claiming "55 seconds below" (actual: 15s under; invents "55"). No mention of Legal Approval's breach.

- **Waiting Time Integration (Minor Error, -0.5 points)**: LLM mentions waits but doesn't jointly prioritize (e.g., calls Receive's 10s "concerning" despite it being lowest). Ground truth ties waits directly to selection rationale.

- **Recommendations (Format and Content Errors, -1.0 points)**: Prompt mandates "bullet points *only* for the recommendations" in a separate section. Ground truth uses a dedicated "**Recommended actions**" with concise, activity-specific bullets (e.g., "Introduce rule-based pre-checks" for Legal Approval). LLM embeds recs in a numbered list under each activity (not bullets-only or separate), and they invent unsubstantiated elements (e.g., "pre-filled... using customer data," "peak periods," "machine learning models"—none in table data, violating "ground in data; do NOT invent"). Ground truth recs are more concrete/tied (e.g., "add one risk analyst," "loans under €25 k"—plausibly data-derived, though table lacks details).

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor Errors, -0.5 points)**: ~150 words met, but LLM adds extraneous elements (e.g., signature, "Best regards," broad subject; intro para not in ground truth). No total cases (4,805 implied from data) or projection (35% reduction). Fails "return *only* the memo text" by including bolding/formatting not in ground truth.

Partial credit for correct quant on two activities, mentioning waits, and memo-like format (total ~4.0 base, adjusted down for severity). Small errors (e.g., invented "55s") compound to major loss, as instructed.
