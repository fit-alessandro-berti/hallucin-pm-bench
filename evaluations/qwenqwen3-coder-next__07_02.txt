### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies **all** actual changes—3 added tasks (exact IDs), 1 removed task (exact ID), and the gateway type change (exclusive to inclusive). Uses the exact required headings. Ignores renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name) and XML ordering as instructed. No fabricated changes.
- **Major Deductions** (significant point loss per strict criteria):
  - **Missing task names** (-2.0): Ground truth prominently lists human-readable **names** (bolded) alongside IDs for all added/removed tasks (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"). LLM omits names entirely, using only IDs—critical omission, as names are core to BPMN summarization readability/meaning.
  - **Gateway verbosity & inaccuracies** (-1.0): Adds unrequested analysis ("now supports multiple outgoing paths (three instead of two)", "consistent with Inclusive semantics", "allowing multiple flows to be taken (or at least modeled as non-exclusive)")—beyond "Gateway-type changes (e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)". Mislabels inclusive as "(AND/OR)" vs. ground truth's precise "(OR)". Lacks "in *v1* to ... in *v2*" specificity.
  - **Formatting/structure mismatch** (-0.5): No numbering (ground truth uses 1., 2., 3.), no bolding/italics, different bullets (•/– vs. * **), no closing note ("*(No other ...)*"). Indentation inconsistent.
- **Overall**: Substance ~90% aligned, but strict "differences = lower grade" and "small errors significant loss" penalize omissions/extras/formatting heavily. Not a near-match; more like a concise but incomplete/verbose variant.
