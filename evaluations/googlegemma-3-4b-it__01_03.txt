3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 4.0/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies the skip condition and TriVote gate but incorrectly treats the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a "decision point" (it is a procedural step producing an input for the actual conditional branch, per the process description). This adds an extraneous item, inflating the count to three instead of the ground truth's two focused points. The descriptions are mostly accurate but not consolidated precisely (e.g., TriVote phrasing omits "record 'Approve'" specificity, and the skip rule is worded less formally). Strict deduction for structural inaccuracy and over-inclusion, as even minor mischaracterization of "decision point" (gate or conditional branch) warrants significant loss.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents (Score: 3.0/10)**: Major incompletenessâ€”omits the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicitly required as inputs in step 3 and appear before the Deck Memo. Lists only 6 items vs. ground truth's 9, disrupting the "first-appearance order" and ignoring key process elements. Signed Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration are correctly included and ordered, but the omissions are critical errors (not minor, as they represent ~33% of the list and directly contradict the prompt's "all documents" requirement). No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions), but absence of mandated items is a severe flaw.

- **Overall (Adjusted to 3.5/10)**: The response addresses the prompt structure and stays on-topic without extraneous content beyond a minor unsolicited question, but the combined errors in accuracy, completeness, and fidelity to the process description (e.g., scorecards as "required anywhere") result in a low score under strict criteria. Significant point loss for these deviations from ground truth.
