4.5

**a) Decision Points**

Strengths:
- The LLM answer correctly identifies the two decision points: (1) skip-or-not after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check based on risk + amount, and (2) the TriVote approval gate.
- The description for the TriVote decision is clear and mostly accurate (“at least two out of three approvals”).

Errors/shortcomings:
- The answer lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a “decision point,” but this is actually a risk assessment step, not a decision gate or conditional branch. This is an error: there are only two true decision points.
- The phrasing for the first decision point is less precise than the ground truth; it doesn't clarify that failing the skip sends the application to manual review.
- The TriVote is not described with the correct threshold in a strictly parallel way to the process description (“two of three must approve,” but not “loan is rejected otherwise”—still, this is a minor difference).

**b) Documents**

Strengths:
- Most documents listed are correct in sequence where named in process.
- No extraneous/hallucinated documents.

Errors/shortcomings:
- Critically, the LLM omits the three scorecards (**Scorecard–Cyan**, **Scorecard–Magenta**, **Scorecard–Yellow**), which are explicit inputs to a process step and first appear before “Deck Memo”.
- By missing these, the ordering of the remaining documents is also off versus the ground truth.
- “Deck Memo” is present as required, but placed as second in order when it could be fifth (right after the three Scorecards).
- “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is split as a separate item (could be justified) but the original process treats it this way as well.
- Omits no required documents but fails to list all mandatory ones in the correct order.

**Summary of grading reasoning:**
- Correctly identifies core decision points, but introduces a false one and lacks precision in conditional logic.
- Fails to list the three scorecards as required documents, which is a major omission and fundamentally wrong for a process expert.
- Otherwise, most items are correct and no hallucinations.

**Strict scoring rationale:**  
With two major faults (mislabeling a process step as a decision point and omitting multiple required documents), the answer cannot pass the 5.0/10 bar. Grade = **4.5**
