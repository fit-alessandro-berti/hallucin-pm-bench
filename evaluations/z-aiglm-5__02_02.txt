**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, sequence, and ordering:

- **Q1**: Correct count (3); explicit listing of cases (C001, C002, C003) is accurate and supplementary, not erroneous.
- **Q2**: Exact sequence matches ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order").
- **Q3**: Exact distinct predecessors ("Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock", alphabetically ordered, one per line); minor formatting variance (no dashes) aligns with prompt ("one per line"), not a factual deviation.
