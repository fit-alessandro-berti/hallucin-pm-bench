6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
The LLM answer matches the ground truth in status for R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6, and correctly identifies the overall NON-COMPLIANT result. Justifications are concise (≤20 words) and mostly aligned, but there are critical errors:

- **R2**: Major violation—status incorrectly marked Compliant (should be Violated). Justification ignores the Change_Request triggering a new approval under R5, making the "last required approval" on 2025-03-07 (Manager_Approval #2), with Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 occurring *before* it, not within 2 days after. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of rule interactions, warranting severe deduction (~3 points loss).

- **R5**: Status correct (Violated), but justification incomplete—focuses only on Ship_Goods preceding new Manager_Approval, omitting Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) also occurring before it. Minor but notable gap under strict criteria (~0.5 points loss).

- Other rules: Strong alignment in status and justification; no deductions.

Overall score reflects 4/6 rules fully accurate, with the R2 error being significantly penalizing due to its centrality to the trace analysis.
