6.0

R1: The LLM answer is correct.
R2: The LLM answer is wrong. It says “Compliant” but should say “Violated”; it incorrectly interprets the timing—the relevant approvals are not just the initial ones, but a new Manager_Approval is needed after the Change_Request before Ship_Goods; Ship_Goods occurred before this approval, so it is a violation.
R3: Correct.
R4: Correct.
R5: Correct in outcome but partially incomplete in justification: it only points to Ship_Goods, but Pay_Invoice also violates R5 (it occurs before the new Manager_Approval).
R6: Correct.

The overall result is correct.

Significant error on R2 (misclassified a violation), and insufficient explanation for R5 (didn't mention both violations). All other answers are correct. Since a strict scale is requested, and a major rule is missed, only 6.0 is awarded.
