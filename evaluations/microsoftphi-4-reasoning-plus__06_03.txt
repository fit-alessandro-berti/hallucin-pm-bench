### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Accuracy (Strength):** The LLM correctly identifies the two parallel sets from Process B: (1) Quality_Check and Update_Inventory; (2) Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement. This matches the ground truth's essential content with no factual errors or inclusion of Processes A/C.
- **Format and Structure (Major Weaknesses):** 
  - Includes unnecessary introductory text ("Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment includes two parallel constructs..."), which adds extraneous context not in the ground truth or prompt.
  - Uses descriptive labels like "Parallel Split #1:" instead of the ground truth's "Set 1 – first parallel block:", deviating from the requested "Number the sets" style.
  - Employs "and" for concurrency instead of the ground truth's precise "‖" symbol, reducing clarity on parallelism.
  - Lacks bolding, backticks for task names, and the closing statement ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel"), making it less structured and complete.
  - The provided "LLM ANSWER" is bloated with internal reasoning/monologue (e.g., restating the prompt, double-checking sequences), which should not be part of the final response—violating the expectation of a clean, direct answer.
- **Strictness Applied:** Per instructions, even minor deviations (e.g., formatting, extra words, missing elements) result in significant point loss. Content is 90% aligned, but presentation/format issues and verbosity drop it below a perfect score. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply here.
