**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually precise and fully matches the ground truth across all questions:

- **Q1/A1**: Exact match ("3").
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"), correct order, uses specified "→" separator (minor space rendering differences like narrow no-break spaces are insignificant for content precision).
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct predecessors ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, correctly alphabetized (A before C), no extras/missing/fabrications. Format adheres to "one per line" instruction (dashes/<br> in ground truth are presentational, not required).
