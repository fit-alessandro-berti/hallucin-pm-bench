The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B but fails significantly on formatting, ordering, and output structure: incorrect "Task_" prefixes (not matching ground truth naming), duplication of the Create_Documentation/Quality_Check pair, reverse alphabetical order within one instance of that pair, and non-alphabetical overall list ordering. These violations of the prompt's explicit instructions (alphabetical within pairs and overall, one pair per line without duplicates, exact format) result in major deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score despite correct pair identification.
