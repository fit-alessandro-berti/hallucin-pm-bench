3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit):** The LLM answer correctly uses all four authorized vocabulary terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, without any synonyms, leaks, or alternative phrasings—fully compliant with the strict policy. The Markdown table format is used, roles are not renamed or merged, and no disallowed terms appear. It attempts to cover the core process steps without adding fictional elements.
  
- **Major Weaknesses (significant deductions):** 
  - **Activities mismatch:** The answer incorrectly identifies and structures activities, adding non-narrative terms like "Payment Scheduling" and "Notification" as separate rows, while merging or omitting key steps (e.g., no explicit "Compliance Officer Approval" as a distinct escalation activity). The ground truth precisely maps narrative steps without additions or merges, resulting in incomplete coverage of "every activity." This violates the "do not rename, merge, or add activities" instruction, leading to a ~3-point deduction.
  - **RACI assignments inaccurate:** Assignments deviate substantially from the ground truth. For example:
    - "Intake Vetting": LLM assigns only "R" to Front-Office Analyst (missing "A", "C" for Compliance Analyst, and "I" for Treasury Ops).
    - "KYC Review" and "AML Screening": LLM assigns only "R" to Compliance Analyst (missing "A", "C" for Compliance Officer, and "I" for Treasury Ops).
    - "Risk Scoring": LLM uses conditional "A (if >70)" for Compliance Officer (non-standard RACI; ground truth has unconditional "A" and adds "C" for Front-Office, "I" for Treasury). Conditionals introduce ambiguity not in the ground truth.
    - Added rows like "Payment Scheduling" and "Funds Release" have invented assignments (e.g., "C (if >70)" for Officer in scheduling), ignoring ground truth's interconnected "C" and "I" roles across steps.
    - No row for "Compliance Officer Approval," and "Notification" is isolated incorrectly (ground truth integrates notifications implicitly via "I" roles without a separate row).
    These errors affect nearly every cell, showing poor mapping of responsibilities—~3-point deduction for inaccuracy.
  - **Table and formatting issues:** Header mislabeled as "Role / Activity" (should be "Activity" per standard and ground truth). Uses blank cells instead of "–" for no involvement. Includes an unnecessary "Key" and note explaining adjustments, which adds extraneous content not in the ground truth or prompt—~0.5-point deduction.
  - **Overall completeness:** Fails to cover "every activity and role" interconnections (e.g., widespread "C" and "I" in ground truth reflect process flow; LLM is overly simplistic). Strict evaluation penalizes these as fundamental failures in producing a compliant, accurate RACI matrix.

Total score reflects correct vocabulary adherence but severe deviations in structure, activities, and assignments, warranting a low-to-mid range under utmost strictness.
