3.0

**Analysis:**

The LLM answer has several significant deviations from the ground truth, according to the strict evaluation criteria:

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer correctly uses only the authorized vocabulary for the four mandated activities (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**), with no forbidden synonyms leaking into the output.
- The answer presents the requested roles and activities in a Markdown table.

**Major Issues:**

1. **Incomplete Coverage of Activities:**
   - The ground truth lists 6 activities: “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”, “Compliance Officer Approval”, “Release Funds”.
   - The LLM matrix omits “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds” (instead splitting “Release Funds” into “Funds Release” and “Notification” as separate steps, and adding a “Payment Scheduling” step that is not present in the ground truth).

2. **Incorrect RACI Assignments:**
   - The assignments in the LLM answer significantly diverge from ground truth:
     - "Accountable" (A) is given only to the Compliance Officer for "Risk Scoring" (if >70), not to roles who should be both R and A as per ground truth.
     - "Responsible" and "Accountable" are NOT dual-assigned (R, A) anywhere, while the ground truth shows several such dual assignments.
     - Throughout, "Consulted" and "Informed" assignments are missing or misallocated according to the ground truth.

3. **Unauthorized Activities:**
   - "Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", and "Notification" are not part of the ground truth activity list and thus constitute a significant deviation.

4. **Activity Naming Discrepancies:**
   - "Funds Release" and "Notification" do not match the exact “Release Funds” activity from the ground truth.
   - "Payment Scheduling" is an invented activity, which is not authorized.

5. **Formatting:**
   - The ground truth makes clear use of "R, A" to denote both Responsible and Accountable for the same role; the LLM answer splits these and loses fidelity.
   - The '-' symbol for non-involvement is not used; instead the LLM leaves cells blank.
   - The activity labels in the left column are not strictly matching those in the ground truth.

**Conclusion:**

Though the authorized vocabulary is used and synonyms are avoided, the answer omits required activities, invents unauthorized ones, and misassigns RACI designations compared with the ground truth. Even single errors require a significant point loss; here, the output is substantially incorrect in both structure and content, except for its adherence to vocabulary policy.

**Thus, 3.0/10.0 is assigned—to reflect marginal basic compliance, but major deviations from what was required.**
