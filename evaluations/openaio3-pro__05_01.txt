The LLM answer correctly identifies the need for an interrupting boundary timer event with a 48-hour duration (PT48H) and a new sequence flow to Task_Triage, ensuring no new tasks are added. It also describes auto-escalation to meet the SLA. However, it incorrectly attaches the timer to Task_RequestDocs instead of Task_Receive, which fails to enforce the 48-hour SLA from submission (Start_Claim) across the entire pathâ€”delays in Receive or Check could exceed the limit before reaching RequestDocs, violating the requirement. This core flaw, plus extraneous details (e.g., timeDate reference), results in significant deduction under strict evaluation.
