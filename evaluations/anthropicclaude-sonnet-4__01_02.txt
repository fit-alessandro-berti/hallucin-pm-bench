7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core content of the ground truth effectively, correctly identifying all three decision points and their conditions, and listing all required documents without introducing extraneous terminology. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences warrant a significant deduction (total -2.5 points from a perfect 10.0):

- **Decision Points Structure and Wording (-1.0)**: The LLM uses a bulleted list with step numbers (e.g., "Step 5") and arrows (→), while the ground truth uses a numbered list without step references, employs "⇒" symbols, and includes precise contextual phrases like "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check." The LLM's phrasing (e.g., "continue to step 6" and "proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)") slightly deviates from the ground truth's more concise "continue" and "send to," adding unnecessary specificity not present in the ground truth.
  
- **Formatting and Capitalization (-0.5)**: Minor inconsistencies, such as italics for "*approve* or *reject*" vs. the ground truth's bold "**Approve** or **Reject**," and the use of "##" headers vs. "####," create stylistic mismatches.

- **Required Documents (-1.0)**: The list is complete and uses the prompt's exact terminology, but differs in presentation (bullets ▪ vs. numbered list) and wording: 
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's "(≤ 3 months)" (omits "old").
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" (adds "single" and uses "or" vs. "/").
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (includes "template," which ground truth omits).
  The ground truth also ends with an explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") absent in the LLM, emphasizing the non-standard nature, which the LLM overlooks.

- **Currency Formatting (-0.5)**: The LLM uses "€15,000" (with comma), inconsistent with the ground truth and prompt's "€15 000" (space separator), a small but precise error in a financial context.

These accumulate to prevent a higher score, despite strong overall alignment.
