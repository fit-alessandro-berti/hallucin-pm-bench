The LLM answer contains all required differences and only those, but has two significant formatting issues compared to the ground truth:

1. The ADDED TASKS, REMOVED TASKS, and GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES sections omit the "-" bullet formatting required by the specification (“id followed by name in parentheses”, but also with a dash as in the ground truth).
2. For GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, the answer omits the dash in front of each, and for Gateway_Payment, is missing the alignment (space padding) before the gateway id as shown in the ground truth (“Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel”).

Otherwise, the content is complete and correct, but these formatting errors (especially omission of the required dash to start the lines), would warrant a strict penalty.
