The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all verifiable functional changes (added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway type changes) matching the ground truth in content and order, with no extras, omissions, or commentary. It adheres to the specified formats for tasks (id followed by name in parentheses) and gateways (id: old â†’ new). Minor deductions for formatting differences: absence of leading dashes ("-") before each list item (present in all 6 ground truth items) and lack of alignment/indentation on the second gateway line, which slightly deviates from the ground truth presentation despite not being explicitly required by the prompt.
