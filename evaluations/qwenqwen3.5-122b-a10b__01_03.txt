6.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
**Part a) - Score: 8.0/10**  
- Correctly identifies both decision points.  
- Rules accurately summarized in one sentence each.  
- Minor deductions for: non-matching descriptive titles ("Step 4 Conditional Branch" vs. "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; "Step 6 TriVote Gate" vs. "“TriVote” approval gate"); phrasing differences ("skips" vs. "bypasses...otherwise proceeds"; "proceeds to offer preparation if...approve the application" vs. "may advance only when...record 'Approve.'"); no bolding/emphasis matching ground truth; "€250,000 or less" vs. "≤ €250 000". These are small but penalized heavily per instructions.

**Part b) - Score: 4.0/10**  
- Lists first 6 documents correctly in order.  
- Major errors: **Misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" entirely** (explicitly required in step 8; treated as distinct from "Offer Sheet 77") → incomplete list (8 vs. 9 items).  
- Consequent order errors: "ID Matrix Declaration" wrongly positioned as #7 (should be #8, after "Signed Offer Sheet 77"); "Loan Dossier 2025" as #8 (should be #9).  
- No hallucinations, but failure to list **all** documents violates prompt exactly.

**Overall: 6.0/10** (weighted average; strict penalty for incompleteness and mismatches despite strong partial match).
