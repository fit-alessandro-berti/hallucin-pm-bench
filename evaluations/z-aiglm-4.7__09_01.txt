**9.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the value cannot be derived, aligning with the system instruction and ground truth conclusion. It provides a clear, concise explanation focused on the absence of timestamps/elapsed times, accurately lists the relevant cases, and avoids fabrication. Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly mirroring ground truth phrasing (e.g., "cannot be computed... lacks... timestamps, durations or ordering information" vs. LLM's "requires the duration... timestamps and elapsed-time fields... redacted"); (2) no mention of "ordering information" (though log implies sequence, strict evaluation notes omission); (3) lacks the emphatic warning against "fabricated" answers. Substance is near-identical, but strict criteria penalize phrasing variances.
