7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core elements of the process: three decision points (eligibility validation, pre-approval, and the €1,000 amount threshold with branching), and it lists all seven required documents accurately without introducing extras. It also notes the conditional nature of the *AuditTrail* implicitly through context and acknowledges potential termination paths in validation/approval steps, aligning reasonably with the ground truth's emphasis on outcomes (e.g., continue vs. reject).

However, under strict evaluation:
- **Structure and precision (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: The ground truth uses a clear table for decision points with explicit branching logic/outcomes (e.g., "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → claim rejected"). The LLM answer uses prose with some repetition and extra commentary (e.g., on business process modeling), which dilutes focus and doesn't match the tabular summary format. It treats pre-approval as a decision point but doesn't explicitly frame it (or combine it with auditor review) as the "final payment approval" with approve/reject outcomes, leading to a slight mismatch in the third point.
- **Irrelevant additions (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: The boxed "\boxed{3}" (appearing twice, once with "The number of decision points is") and the "Suitable for the User" section introduce unsolicited elements not requested in the prompt (which asks only to summarize decision points and list documents). This deviates from strict adherence, treating the response as if answering an unasked question about counting points.
- **Minor omissions (minor deduction: -0.5 point)**: It doesn't explicitly note the conditional use of *AuditTrail* (as in ground truth: "only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue") or reiterate the constraint against legacy activities/documents, though it avoids introducing them.

Overall, the answer is substantively close (80-85% alignment) but loses points for imprecision, verbosity, and extraneous content that could mislead or overcomplicate the summary. A perfect match would require the ground truth's concise table, exact outcome phrasing, and no extras.
