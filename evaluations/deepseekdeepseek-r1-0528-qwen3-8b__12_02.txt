The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a accurate justification in one paragraph, citing the key counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11) with precise line numbers and case-IDs, directly addressing why Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order. It closely aligns with the ground truth in structure, logic, and evidence, including the emphasis on sequencing within cases and the absence of a preceding Receive_Order in C005 (implied by "without a preceding" and verified against the fragment). Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., no bullet points, backticks vs. italics, and slightly less explicit phrasing on C005 lacking any Receive_Order "at all") and not mirroring the exact wording of the conclusion, but these are small and do not undermine factual accuracy or completeness.
