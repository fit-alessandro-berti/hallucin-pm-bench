8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the fact is inaccurate and gives the right "No" answer. It also points out both C003 (lines 6 and 7) and C005 (line 11) as counterexamples, referencing line numbers and briefly describing the event order problem in C003 and the absence in C005. However, there are minor inaccuracies in phrasing:

- The LLM says "not preceded by a `Receive_Order`" for C003, which is true, though the gold standard also notes explicitly that the order is inverted (a nuance the LLM only hints at).
- The justification for C005 is a bit vague—it says “as verified by the fragment” rather than clearly stating that `Receive_Order` never appears for C005.
- The explanation doesn't restate outright that C005 does not contain `Receive_Order` at all, as in the gold answer.
- There's a slight lack of directness and formality compared to the gold standard (“verified by the fragment” vs direct statement).

Despite these being relatively minor, per the strictness required and the small but clear differences in clarity/precision, I deduct 2 points. So, the LLM answer earns an 8.0.
