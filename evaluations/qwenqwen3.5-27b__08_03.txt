**9.0**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in structure, content, and intent: both affirm "Yes," provide the identical **shortest prefix sequence** `T1, T2b, T4, T5` demonstrating T5 firing without prior T3 (ground truth explicitly marks this at step 4 and notes the 4-step lower bound), include equivalent step-by-step markings, and explain the shortcut (T2b avoids pc/T3). Minor differences (LLM lists only the 4-step sequence vs. ground truth's extended 6-step for full order including post-T5 T3; no explicit minimality proof in LLM; slight phrasing variations like "in this path") are present but do not alter correctness or core demonstration. Strict deduction for sequence length mismatch and lacking full proof of minimality (-1.0 total).
