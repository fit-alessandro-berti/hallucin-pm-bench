9.5

**Evaluation:**

**Q1:**  
LLM Answer: "3 distinct cases."  
Ground Truth: "3"  
**Assessment:** Correct (no error).

**Q2:**  
LLM Answer: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order."  
Ground Truth: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"  
**Assessment:** Correct sequence, correct separator. Only error is the use of a full stop at the end, which is a trivial formatting difference, but per strictness, this is a small markdown.

**Q3:**  
LLM Answer:
- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock  

Ground Truth:
- Arrange\_Delivery  
- Check\_Stock  

**Assessment:** The LLM used standard spaces instead of underscores; the ground truth preserves underscores from the original event names, and the prompt says to list "every distinct activity," which technically includes the full label with underscores as shown in the log fragment. By not preserving underscores, the LLM introduced a tiny inaccuracy per the "utmost strictness" policy, as the activity names in the prompt include underscores.

**Conclusion:**  
Every answer is substantively correct, but the following extremely minor errors are present:
- Omitted underscores in the names for Q3 (A3).
- Added a full stop at the end of the sequence in Q2 (A2).

Each is a very slight loss, but with the utmost strictness, the LLM does not get a perfect score. Therefore, **9.5** is the strict, appropriate score.
