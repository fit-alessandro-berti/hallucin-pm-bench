7.2

The LLM's answer demonstrates clear understanding of the task and uses only table-supplied data. However, in strict comparison to the ground truth and following your strict grading instructions, the following errors and differences are penalized accordingly:

**Strengths:**  
• Correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.  
• Quantifies by how much each activity exceeds its SLA (though with rounding/inexact figures).  
• Gives one data-driven recommendation per activity, in bullet point form only.  
• Omits mention of activities not in the source table or metrics not provided.

**Weaknesses and penalties:**  
1. The LLM's percentage format for SLA breaches is misleading, and the math is off (e.g., Risk Review is "100% above" SLA when it's 600 vs 300 = +300s, or +100%, while Legal Approval's 900 vs 600 is called "50% over", which should be +50%, but isn't stated as "+300s over SLA" as required). The calculation style and clarity deviate from the GT.
2. It does not state the explicit “+X s” quantifier in parenthesis as in the ground truth ("+300 s"), but instead only refers to over-percentage or absolute time, leading to slight ambiguity.
3. Recommendations are plausible and data-driven, but in some cases not as precise or as tailored as the ground truth—e.g., the Legal Approval action is “reallocate resources from non-casebacks” (which could be considered an invented intervention, as "casebacks" aren't mentioned in the data), while the ground truth uses a more conservative approach: "rule-based pre-checks so low-risk files bypass full Legal Approval".
4. The final statement claiming “doubling customer experience loss” for Legal Approval is not data-grounded and unnecessarily qualitative.
5. It does not include the end-line quantitative impact statement of the ground truth ("Implementing these changes...35%").
6. Memo headings and formatting differ; the LLM's version is less formalized, although still functional.
7. Number of cases per activity not mentioned (as in the ground truth), a minor but not insignificant oversight.

**Overall:**
The LLM answer remains very close to the ground truth, but given the requirement for extremely strict adherence and that even small errors should reflect in significant loss of points, a 7.2/10 is warranted. The differences in quantification style, lack of explicit “+X s” clarity, minor inventions, and the omission of projected impact together warrant roughly a 28% penalty.
