### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) as the ground truth, prioritizing them jointly on SLA breaches and waiting times, with accurate data pulls from the table (e.g., throughput times of 600s/300s, 900s/600s, 300s/240s; waitings of 480s, 600s, 200s). It adheres to the memo format, uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations, and stays within ≈150 words while returning only memo text. No absent activities or metrics are mentioned.

However, strict deductions apply for:
- **Quantification mismatch (-1.5 points)**: The prompt requires quantifying "by how much each activity exceeds its SLA," implying absolute differences (e.g., ground truth's +300s, +60s). The LLM uses relative percentages (100% above, 50% over, 25% overshoot), which is a derivational interpretation but not a direct match, introducing a subtle but significant deviation.
- **Order and presentation differences (-1.0 point)**: Activities are listed in a different order (Risk Review first vs. Legal Approval first), and terminology like "service-time" (vs. ground truth's "average throughput") adds minor inconsistency. Subject line and header phrasing also diverge without justification.
- **Recommendations divergence (-1.0 point)**: While both provide one concrete, data-driven action per activity (tied to waiting times/SLA), the specifics are entirely different (e.g., LLM's "data-based triage" and "50% resource re-allocation" vs. ground truth's "rule-based pre-checks" and "add one risk analyst"). This reflects creative invention not aligned with the ground truth, despite both being plausibly data-grounded.
- **Minor inventions and grounding lapses (-0.5 point)**: Phrases like "doubling customer experience loss" and "highest in early onboarding" are not directly grounded in the table data, echoing the prompt's rule against inventing. The ground truth has similar issues (e.g., total cases "4 805" doesn't sum from table; invented projections), but evaluation is relative—LLM's extras still deduct.

Overall, the answer fulfills core prompt requirements (70-80% alignment) but loses points for non-identical execution, quantification style, and content variations under utmost strictness.
