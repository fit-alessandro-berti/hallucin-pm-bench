The LLM answer correctly states that it is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for "Approve Invoice" due to missing underlying data—specifically, the absence of event rows and timestamps. It identifies that Artefact A contains only headers and that Artefact B has only contextual, not raw, data.

However, the response is somewhat verbose and slightly less direct than the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer is more concise and specifically clarifies that neither the average, nor measures of dispersion or confidence intervals can be calculated, and that additional raw log entries are necessary.

The minor point deduction reflects that the LLM answer could be somewhat shorter and more to-the-point, and could echo more explicitly that neither metric can be calculated due to the lack of data rows—matching the clarity of the ground truth. But factually, the answer is correct and complete.
