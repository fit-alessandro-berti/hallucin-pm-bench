The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A (headers only, no rows or timestamps for cycle time calculation) and correctly implies Artefact B's irrelevance without relying on it. It precisely addresses all three required metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, 95% CI) and explains the absence of necessary observations/durations for "Approve Invoice." Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., elaborating on Artefact B and phrasing "no quantitative analysis" vs. ground truth's concise "neither...nor" structure and explicit call for "additional raw log entries"), which introduces negligible redundancy under strict evaluation. No factual errors or guesses.
