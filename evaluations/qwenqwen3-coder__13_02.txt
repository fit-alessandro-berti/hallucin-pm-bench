**9.0**

**Justification:**

- **Q1:** Correct. States "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time**.
- **Q2a:** Correct. Calculates (1/48)*100 = **2.08%**.
- **Q2b:** Correct. Calculates (1/12)*100 = **8.33%**.
- **Q3:** 
  - Fully captures that the activity is a rare exception and appears only once ("represents an exception rather than the norm").
  - Explains the risk of excluding or mishandling: "models may inaccurately predict process flows or overlook critical deviations", "overgeneralization", "misestimating cycle times", "poor detection of exceptions", and impact on descriptive and predictive accuracy.
  - However, it doesn't specifically reference statistical instability due to having a *single observation* and does not explicitly caution about extreme variance or unreliability in measured statistics (the concept is implied but not as directly as ground truth requires).

**Main deduction:**  
- Missing an explicit warning about instability/variance from a sample size of 1, and not clearly stating the concept of unreliable estimates or confidence intervals. This specific reason is requested in the grading instructions. Otherwise, it is comprehensive, succinct, and correct.

**Therefore:**  
- Minor but meaningful omission in the explanation for Q3: **1 point deducted.**
- All numeric parts perfect.  
**Final score: 9.0**
