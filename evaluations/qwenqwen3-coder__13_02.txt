The numeric responses (1, 2a, 2b) are exact matches to the ground truth, including calculations and rounding. The explanation for question 3 is concise (68 words â‰¤100), captures the caution against over-generalization (iii), and implies rarity as an exception, but partially misses explicit emphasis on single-occurrence fragility (i) and variance/instability (e.g., noise, skewing, confidence intervals; ii), treating it more generally as "low-support" without tying to the n=1 vulnerability. Strict deduction for incomplete alignment on key explanatory criteria, though directionally sound.
