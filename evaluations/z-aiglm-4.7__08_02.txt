The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth: correct "Yes" for Q1, identical minimal sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) demonstrating T5 before T3, and equivalent explanation of the path enabling {P2, P5} without firing T3. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., comma-separated vs. numbered list, partial vs. full markings, separate vs. integrated explanation) do not constitute errors, as the prompt requires only an "ordered list of transition names" and concise explanation (both ≤120 words). No inaccuracies or omissions in logic, markings described match, and it fully demonstrates the property.
