3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Vocabulary adherence (strong match, worth ~2 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") exactly as specified, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere, even implicitly. This fully aligns with the ground truth and prompt policy.
  
- **Structure and format (partial match, worth ~1.5 points)**: The response produces a valid RACI matrix with activities as rows and roles as columns, matching the six process steps without adding extras. Headers include role abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT), though full names are added unnecessarily (minor bloat). The table uses markdown correctly, and a key is provided (helpful but unwarranted, as ground truth has none). Introduction text ("Of course...") and title are extra and not in ground truth, introducing unwarranted content.

- **RACI correctness (poor match, worth ~0 points)**: This is the core failure, with significant deviations across nearly all rows, violating the ground truth and narrative reflection:
  - **Receive Application**: AM "R, A" correct (matches GT "R / A"); CO "I" vs. GT "C" (wrong); FC and IT empty vs. GT "I" (missing, assumes no involvement—error).
  - **KYC Review**: CO "R, A" partially matches GT "R" but adds unwarranted "A" (GT places "A" on AM); AM "C, I" vs. GT "A" (wrong letters, misplaced accountability); FC empty vs. "C"; IT empty vs. "I" (missing).
  - **Order Vetting**: AM "R, A" correct (matches GT); FC "I" correct; but CO "I" vs. "C" (wrong); IT empty vs. "I" (missing).
  - **Payment Clearance**: FC "R, A" matches "R" but adds unwarranted "A" (GT places "A" on AM); AM "C, I" vs. "A" (wrong); CO empty vs. "C"; IT "I" correct.
  - **Record Update**: IT "R, A" matches "R" but adds unwarranted "A" (GT has no "A" shown, implying elsewhere like AM); AM "C, I" vs. "C" (extra "I"); CO empty vs. "I"; FC empty vs. "C" (missing).
  - **Notify Customer**: AM "R, A" correct; FC "I" correct; but CO and IT empty vs. "I" (missing).
  - Overall: Fails "exactly one Responsible" per row (mostly ok, but extras like dual R/A dilute); misplaces Accountable (e.g., on performers like CO/FC/IT instead of AM where appropriate per narrative); omits/misassigns many "C" and "I" (e.g., widespread empties). This does not reflect the process narrative accurately (e.g., AM as primary owner for applications/orders/notifications).

- **Unwarranted content (minor deduction, already factored)**: Intro, title, and key add fluff not in ground truth, but not egregious. No extra tasks/roles/columns.

- **Overall strictness**: With utmost strictness, the RACI errors (core output) are pervasive and not "small"—they fundamentally misrepresent responsibilities (e.g., 8+ cell mismatches, misplaced A's). Partial credit for format/terms, but content accuracy is ~30% aligned, justifying a low score.
