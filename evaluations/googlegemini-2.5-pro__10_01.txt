6.0

- **Terminology adherence**: The LLM answer *does* strictly use the required terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) and never mentions forbidden terms, so no points lost here.
- **RACI assignments**: There are several notable discrepancies compared to the ground truth:
  - **Receive Application**:  
    - LLM: AM = R, A; CO = I  
    - Ground truth: AM = R/A; CO = C; FC = I; IT = I  
    - **Errors**: LLM omits FC and IT (should be I); CO is incorrectly only I (should be C).
  - **KYC Review**:  
    - LLM: AM = C, I; CO = R, A  
    - Ground truth: AM = A; CO = R; FC = C; IT = I  
    - **Errors**: LLM omits FC and IT entirely, splits A between CO (should be AM), and gives AM C, I instead of only A.
  - **Order Vetting**:  
    - LLM: AM = R, A; CO = I; FC = I  
    - Ground truth: AM = R/A; CO = C; FC = I; IT = I  
    - **Errors**: CO is I instead of C; IT is omitted; all I's and C's are incomplete.
  - **Payment Clearance**:  
    - LLM: AM = C, I; FC = R, A; IT = I  
    - Ground truth: AM = A; CO = C; FC = R; IT = I  
    - **Errors**: LLM omits CO; gives AM C, I (should be A).
  - **Record Update**:  
    - LLM: AM = C, I; IT = R, A  
    - Ground truth: AM = C; CO = I; FC = C; IT = R  
    - **Errors**: LLM omits CO and FC, gives AM I in addition to C (should just be C).
  - **Notify Customer**:  
    - LLM: AM = R, A; FC = I  
    - Ground truth: AM = R/A; CO = I; FC = I; IT = I  
    - **Errors**: LLM omits CO and IT; fails to mark them I. FC is only I (okay), but not all "I"s are present.
- **Matrix completeness**: The LLM matrix repeatedly leaves some roles *blank* for several activities where ground truth lists them as *I* (or C). That is a significant error—RACI matrices should explicitly state each role's status for each activity.
- **Formatting**: The formatting is correct and readable.

**Overall**: The LLM answer is largely correct in terminology and format, but makes several significant errors in RACI assignments—roles are omitted from multiple activities, and some statuses (C, I, A) are not allocated as in the ground truth. While the structure is decent, these assignment omissions are material and recurring, which warrants a strict deduction.

**Summary**:  
- No points lost for terminology or unwarranted content.
- Up to 4 points lost for repeated assignment/omission errors (core to a RACI matrix task), as each row has several mistakes.
- 6.0 reflects that it is structurally correct and follows instructions on terminology, but has notable lapses on role coverage and status precision.
