8.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth on Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, it makes a single but significant error in Q5: it improperly includes "Quality_Check" in the list of activities that never appear first, despite "Quality_Check" being the first activity for case C-77. All other aspects are correct. According to the guidelines to grade with utmost strictness, even a single item wrong in the Q5 list warrants a significant penalty, but not a a failing score since four out of five fields are absolutely correct (especially since Q5 could be interpreted as a bit tricky). Thus, 8.0.
