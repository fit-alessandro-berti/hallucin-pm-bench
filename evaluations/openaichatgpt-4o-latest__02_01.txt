8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match (3 distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). No deduction.
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case A-9321). No deduction.
- **Q3**: Exact match (earliest timestamp is "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00" for Receive_Order in A-9321). No deduction.
- **Q4**: Exact match (2 occurrences of "Quality_Check": one in B-1045, one in C-77). No deduction.
- **Q5**: Partial match but clear error. Ground truth lists 3 activities that never appear as first events: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]. LLM correctly includes those 3 but erroneously adds "Quality_Check", which *does* appear as the first event in case C-77. This inclusion introduces factual inaccuracy and inflates the list unnecessarily. Under strict evaluation, this error (one incorrect item out of four, misidentifying an activity's starting status) warrants a significant deduction equivalent to ~1.5 points for the question.

**Overall Score Justification**: 4/5 questions are perfect (100% for Q1-Q4), but Q5 has a non-trivial factual error affecting completeness and accuracy. Strict policy penalizes even "small" errors heavily, but the error is isolated and the list is otherwise correct, so deduction is calibrated at 1.5 points from 10.0 (not a total failure of the question). Format and JSON schema are fully compliant.
