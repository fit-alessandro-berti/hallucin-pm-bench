**8.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists **all** required changes under the **exact** headings, with accurate content matching the ground truth (added: 3 tasks; removed: 1 task; gateway change on `Gateway_Decision` from exclusive to inclusive). No extraneous changes mentioned, cosmetic renamings ignored as instructed.

Minor deductions for stylistic/formatting differences reflecting strict evaluation:
- List style: Bullets (`-`) vs. numbered (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) [-0.2]
- Task presentation: ID first `(name)` vs. name first **bold** (`ID`) consistently reversed [-0.2]
- Gateway description: Concise ("Exclusive → Inclusive") vs. detailed ("changed from **exclusive** (XOR) ... to **inclusive** (OR) in *v1* to *v2*"), missing BPMN shorthand (XOR/OR) and version refs [-0.1]
- Missing final confirmatory note (minor, as not strictly required) [-0.0]
- Heading markdown: `###` vs. `* **bold**` (negligible) [0.0]

Substance perfect (no factual errors); format close but not identical, warranting small but noticeable point loss per strictness rule.
