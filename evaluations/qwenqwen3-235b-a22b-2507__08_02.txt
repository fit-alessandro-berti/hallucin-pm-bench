1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and demonstrates a critical misunderstanding of the Petri net structure. It wrongly concludes "No" for Question 1, ignoring the alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) that enables T5 without firing T3, leaving P2 marked. The explanation for Question 2 fabricates dependencies (e.g., claiming T3 is "essential") that do not exist, directly contradicting the ground truth sequence and reasoning. This is a complete reversal of the correct answer, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
