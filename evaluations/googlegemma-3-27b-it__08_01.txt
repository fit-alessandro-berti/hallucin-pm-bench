1.0

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, providing the opposite conclusion ("No") to the ground truth ("Yes") and including a flawed proof that misinterprets the inhibitor arc (claiming T3 must fire first to enable T5, when exactly the reverse is true). It fails to identify the valid firing sequence or enabling conditions, resulting in zero alignment with the ground truth on key facts, sequence, and justification. Under strict evaluation, this warrants the minimum score.
