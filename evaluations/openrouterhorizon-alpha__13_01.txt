9.5

1. The answer ("1") is correct and matches the ground truth.
2. The answer ("5.56%") is correct and formatted correctly; the calculation is implicit but correct.
3. The answer ("A1002") matches ground truth; short format is fine.
4. The two reasons given are both correct, clear, and align precisely with the ground truth reasoning:
   - "Very small, non-representative sample size..." = small sample size/high variance (matches ground truth)
   - "Temporal coverage bias..." = temporal bias (matches ground truth)
   
Only a very minor deduction: while the justification for the first point could slightly more directly mention how a single event skews the percentage, the point is still present and clear. There are no invalid or additional inferred statements, and every detail matches the event log. Thus, strict grading places this at 9.5/10 due to extremely minor wording deviations.
