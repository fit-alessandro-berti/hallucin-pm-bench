### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Exact match on the count (1). Minor deduction for omitting "occurrence" (ground truth specifies it explicitly for clarity), but no factual error. (Full points otherwise.)
- **Question 2**: Correct value (5.56%) and implied calculation. Minor deduction for lacking the explicit calculation formula and exact formatting ("5.56 %" with space and % symbol as shown); strictness requires verbatim adherence to ground truth structure.
- **Question 3**: Correct identifier (A1002). Significant deduction for conciseness—omits the full explanatory phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual\_Fraud\_Check”."), bolding, and escaped underscore, making it less precise and complete per ground truth.
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, valid reasons matching ground truth options (small sample size with variance mention; temporal bias with day-specific details). Minor deduction for introducing "selection bias" (a slight generalization not exactly matching "case-mix bias" or others listed), and for not quantifying variance impact (e.g., ±5.56 pp. example). Still, covers the requirement without hallucination or unjustified inference.

Overall, the LLM answer is highly accurate and derives directly from the log (no assumptions), but loses points for formatting/verbosity inconsistencies and minor phrasing deviations under strict evaluation. No criminal or rule-breaking content.
