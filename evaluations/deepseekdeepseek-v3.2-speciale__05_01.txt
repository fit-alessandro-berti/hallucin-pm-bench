**2.0**

The LLM answer fundamentally fails to ensure the claim **reaches "Triage Claim" within 48 hours**, as required by the SLA. Instead of enforcing progression to Task_Triage (like the ground truth's interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive bypassing delays), it only *monitors* via a parallel branch and sends a notification—allowing delays beyond 48h without forcing Triage. It introduces excessive new elements (parallel gateway PG_SLA, GW_Escalation, message throw Escalate) vs. ground truth's minimal one timer + one flow. Adds process variable modification and incorrect "redirect f1." Multiple violations of "one improvement" simplicity; poor SLA compliance.
