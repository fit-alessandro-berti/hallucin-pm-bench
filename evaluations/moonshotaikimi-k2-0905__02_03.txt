- The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all substantive respects: all three answers are correct.
- Minor deduction: The answer to Q1 writes "3 distinct cases: C123, C456, C789" instead of the stricter "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" and similarly for Q2/Q3. While semantically identical, the answer is slightly less aligned in format to the ground truth.
- Because you requested *utmost strictness*, even small deviations in phrasing and format (use of colons, not stating the answers as "A1/A2/A3", slightly different parenthesis usage) merit losing 0.2 points.

Overall, the answers are entirely correct, but the answer format slightly diverges from the provided ground truth.
