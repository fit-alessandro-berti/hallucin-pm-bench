8.0  
- The LLM answer is semantically accurate and correctly identifies all required elements for the three questions, matching the ground truth content precisely.  
- Minor deductions for lack of exact formatting (no "A1/A2/A3" labels as in ground truth) and slightly verbose phrasing in bullets 2 and 3 (e.g., adding explanatory clauses beyond the concise activity names expected), violating the prompt's "concise" instruction. These small format/conciseness issues warrant a strict but not severe penalty.
