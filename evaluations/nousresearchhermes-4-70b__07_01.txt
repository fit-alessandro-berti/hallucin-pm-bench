8.0

The LLM answer is generally correct and factually identifies the differences as requested, without extra speculation or omissions. However, there are some noteworthy flaws compared to the ground truth and the prompt’s requirements:

**Point Deductions:**
- The LLM answer omits the task names in the “Added tasks” and “Removed tasks” sections, listing only the element ids. The ground truth provides both the names and the ids, and the prompt asks for names “exactly as they appear in the XML.” This is a notable loss, as explicit matching is required.
- The heading formatting does not follow the “exact headings” capitalization/style from the ground truth (e.g., uses bullets and backticks, lowercase, not bold, and does not use the exact heading wording or style; e.g., “Gateway type changes” should be alone as a heading, not a bullet).
- The description under “Gateway type changes” is correct and acceptably specific, though it uses less bolding/formatting than ground truth (but this is minor).

**Summary:**  
- All factual differences are captured.
- Headings and task name presentation lack the precision and explicitness specified.
- Small formatting/content fidelity issues exist.

**Conclusion:** Due to these points, and the prompt requirement for utmost strictness (and “small errors should reflect in significant loss of points”), a two-point deduction is warranted. This gives a strict score of 8.0.
