### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the key factual changes (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the ground truth's core content and the prompt's requirements for factual, XML-based differences without speculation. However, under utmost strictness, deduct significant points for the following differences:

- **Task listings (added/removed)**: LLM lists only IDs (e.g., `check_vip`), omitting the full names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status") that are explicitly present in the XML and included in the ground truth. This makes the response factually incomplete, as the names are part of the readable XML elements (2-point deduction per category).
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: LLM uses indentation and backticks for items, while ground truth uses bullet points (*). Headings match the prompt's bullet style (â€¢) but differ from ground truth's bold (**), creating a presentation mismatch (1-point deduction).
- **Gateway description**: LLM includes XML tags (`<exclusiveGateway>`), which is factual but not in ground truth; ground truth adds version labels ((v1)/(v2)) and bolding for types. No exact match in phrasing or extras like the ground truth's closing note (1-point deduction).
- No "(none)" or extra notes needed, as all categories have items, but ground truth's note adds unnecessary polish absent in LLM.

The response is mostly accurate but lacks the ground truth's detail and exact structure, justifying a mid-high score rather than perfect.
