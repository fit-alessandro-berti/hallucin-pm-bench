### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Part (a) – Major Errors (Severe Point Loss):**
- Ground truth identifies **exactly 2 decision points**: (1) the conditional branch/skip in step 4 (post-risk-check), (2) TriVote gate.
- LLM incorrectly identifies **3**, fabricating an extra "decision point" at the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself (outcome determination), which is *not* a "decision point (gate or conditional branch)" per the prompt/process—it's merely an input generator for the actual branch in step 4. This inflates the count and misattributes.
- LLM's #1 is descriptive noise, not a rule-focused summary; #2 partially overlaps ground truth #1 but splits unnecessarily; #3 roughly matches ground truth #2 but with awkward phrasing ("at least **any two**" vs. precise "at least two... record 'Approve'") and adds "requires approvals from all three" preamble not in ground truth rule.
- Verbose titles/descriptions deviate from "one sentence each" conciseness; fails to mirror ground truth naming (e.g., no "**Risk-based skip after...**" or "**“TriVote” approval gate**").

**Part (b) – Significant Errors (Severe Point Loss):**
- Ground truth lists **9 documents** in precise first-appearance order, treating **Signed Offer Sheet 77** as *distinct/separate* from **Offer Sheet 77** (first in step 7 unsigned; signed + ID in step 8).
- LLM lists only **8**, *omitting Signed Offer Sheet 77 entirely as a standalone item*—mentions it descriptively in #7 but skips listing, disrupting order/count (ID Matrix wrongly follows Offer Sheet 77 directly).
- Minor: Adds unnecessary qualifiers (e.g., "Produced only if...", "Submitted by the applicant...") not in ground truth's minimal list; formatting (bullets, dashes) deviates.

**Overall:** Core content ~70% aligned (identifies real points/documents, no hallucinations), but structural inaccuracies (wrong counts, missing item, extras) are *not* small—violate "every decision point" and "all documents... order they first appear." Strict deduction for non-identical fidelity. No credit for verbosity/clarity.
