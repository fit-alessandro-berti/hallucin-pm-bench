The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time, quotes the required metrics verbatim (with minor formatting consistency like "95p" vs. "p95" and decimal places, but numbers match), and stays under 150 words without mentioning service times or throughput. Actions are concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues, with hour-based targets implying ≥20% reductions (e.g., 8h on 36.5h ≈22%).

However, strict evaluation reveals significant flaws against the prompt and ground truth: (1) References other table activities (Approve_Payment, Initial_Screening) in actions, violating the intent to "mention **only** these three activities" (per ground truth note) and risking "discussion" of non-focus items; (2) Actions do not explicitly state ≥20% cuts (uses hours instead, unlike ground truth's clear percentages like "≥25 %"), weakening data-driven claim; (3) Adds unwarranted extras (e.g., invented date, validation against volumes, total process impact estimate), diverging from ground truth's concise, focused structure without headers or summaries; (4) Narrative format vs. ground truth's list-based body introduces stylistic differences, bloating toward executive crispness. These accumulate to notable deviations, warranting deduction despite strong core compliance.
