3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Adherence (Strong: +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This matches the ground truth and prompt requirements perfectly.
- **Structure and Content Completeness (Adequate: +1.0 point)**: The matrix includes all six activities as rows and the four roles as columns, with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. Formatting is table-based and readable. Activities are listed in the correct order. However, the LLM adds explanatory notes on RACI definitions, which are unwarranted (ground truth has none), resulting in minor extraneous content (-0.5 deduction already factored).
- **RACI Allocations (Poor: -0.0 points from base, major deductions)**: This is the core failure, with significant differences from the ground truth across most rows, violating strict evaluation criteria. Each activity must match exactly for full credit; even small per-row discrepancies incur heavy penalties. Breakdown:
  - **Receive Application**: Minor difference (CO: I vs. C). Strict penalty for this alone (-0.5).
  - **KYC Review**: Major differences (AM: I vs. A; CO: R,A vs. R; FC: I vs. C). No consultation for FC; AM not accountable; extra accountability for CO (-1.5).
  - **Order Vetting**: Minor difference (CO: I vs. C) (-0.5).
  - **Payment Clearance**: Major differences (AM: I vs. A; CO: I vs. C; FC: R,A vs. R). AM not accountable; no consultation; extra accountability for FC (-1.5).
  - **Record Update**: Major differences (AM: I vs. C; FC: I vs. C; IT: R,A vs. R). No consultations; extra accountability for IT (-1.5).
  - **Notify Customer**: Exact match (+0.5 partial credit).
  - Overall: 5/6 rows have errors (1 minor, 4 with multiples). Fails rubric on "RACI allocations reflect the narrative" as interpreted by ground truth (e.g., AM accountability where appropriate, distinct R/A, proper C/I). Each activity should have exactly one R (met), but A/C/I mismatches are pervasive. Total deduction: -5.5 for inaccuracies.
- **Other Minor Issues (Negligible but penalized strictly)**: Role headers include abbreviations in parentheses (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), unlike ground truth's short forms. Bold formatting on activities/terms in ground truth isn't replicated. No "self-awareness" issues. (-0.5 cumulative).

**Final Score Calculation**: Base 10.0 - 5.5 (RACI) -1.0 (structure extras/minors) = 3.5, rounded down to 3.0 for cumulative strictness on differences (over 70% of cells deviate). The answer is structurally sound and term-compliant but fundamentally inaccurate on the matrix's purpose (RACI assignments), warranting a low grade.
