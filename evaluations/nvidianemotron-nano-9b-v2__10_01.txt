8.0

The LLM answer largely follows instructions, with the correct use of the three mandated terms (**KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance**) and correct spelling/capitalisation. Forbidden terms never appear. No extra tasks or roles are introduced.

**Major strengths:**  
- Terminology policy followed 100% (critical for prompt).
- Table format and structure match the requirements.

**Key differences/errors vs. ground truth:**

1. **Assignment:**
   - The LLM marks both R and A (Responsible, Accountable) on virtually every activity for the role actually performing it, whereas the ground truth splits these designations, sometimes A and R are separate (e.g., *KYC Review*: CO is R, AM is A, rather than both R,A on CO).
   - *C* (Consulted) assignments are absent from the LLM answer, even though the ground truth appropriately assigns *C* (e.g., Compliance Officer is *C* for "Receive Application", AM is *C* for "Record Update", etc.)
   - *I* (Informed) is applied broadly, but with less fidelity than the ground truth (which makes more nuanced consulting/informing distinctions, e.g., FC is *C* in *KYC Review*, not *I*).
2. **Notation:**  
   - The ground truth uses **R / A** (indicating a single party is both Responsible and Accountable) for most AM assignments, while the LLM splits R, A (potential source of confusion but not a violation).
   - The LLMâ€™s explanatory section is accurate, but the mapping of R and A could misrepresent process accountability for audits, since in the ground truth sometimes R and A are different roles.

**Conclusion:**  
- The LLM fully matches required terminology (no deduction).
- Structurally compliant with task (no deduction).
- The main error is in **RACI allocation**: missing *Consulted* roles is significant in a process consultation setting, as is less precise assignment of responsibility/accountability.

**Strict grading justification:**  
- LLM should score high for flawless terminology, but drop two points for the major omission of *Consulted* assignments and less accurate R/A splits.

**Final Score:** **8.0**
