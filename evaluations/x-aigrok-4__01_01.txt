### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is generally accurate in identifying core elements from the process description but deviates from the ground truth in structure, completeness, and precision, warranting deductions under strict criteria:

- **Decision Points (major deductions: ~2.5 points lost)**: The ground truth concisely identifies exactly 3 decision points with a table format, explicit branching logic (e.g., "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → rejected"), and integrated treatment of approvals (combining Finance_Controller_PreApprove and Senior_Auditor_Review under one "final payment approval"). The LLM expands to 4 points, treating individual activities (e.g., Senior_Auditor_Review) as standalone decisions rather than branching outcomes, which overcomplicates and mismatches the ground truth's logic. It also omits explicit rejection outcomes (e.g., "claim rejected/returned" or "process ends without payment") and fails to capture the combined approval step, introducing subtle inaccuracies. The narrative list format is less structured than the ground truth's table.

- **Required Documents (minor deductions: ~0.5 points lost)**: The list matches the ground truth's 7 items exactly, with no introductions of undefined artefacts. However, it lacks the ground truth's qualification (AuditTrail "only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue") and the closing note reinforcing the prompt's constraints ("No other documents or legacy activities..."), which adds completeness and adherence to the "do not introduce" rule.

Overall, the answer stays faithful to the defined process without hallucinations but loses points for not mirroring the ground truth's exact framing, count, and nuances—small errors like missing rejections or notes compound to prevent a higher score.
