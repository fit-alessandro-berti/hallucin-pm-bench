**3.2**

### Key Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria Applied):
- **Decision Points (major failure, ~60% weight)**: Ground truth lists **exactly 3 precise branching/gate points** (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with concise flow details, using exact terminology and structure. LLM incorrectly expands to **6 items**, including non-decisions (Quick KYC Verification, Dual Underwriter Split, Neighbourhood Feedback Check) as "decision points," adds extraneous descriptions (e.g., "Verification that involves confirming..."), and misstructures (e.g., separates Dual Underwriter Split from Alignment Gate). This violates "summarise the **decision points**" and "use exactly the activity names," introducing fluff and errors. Penalty: severe (-5.0+ points).
- **Required Documents (minor-moderate issues, ~40% weight)**: Lists all 6 correctly but adds unauthorized descriptions/explanations (e.g., "The basic form filled out by the applicant," "Could be a single pay-stub..."), alters phrasing slightly (e.g., "not older than 3 months" vs. ground truth "≤ 3 months"; includes "template" from prompt while ground truth omits). Misses ground truth's parenthetical note. Penalty: moderate (-1.5 points).
- **Overall Structure/Fidelity**: LLM uses verbose ### headings and numbering with prose; ground truth is concise #### with bullets/asterisks. No standard terminology introduced, but extras dilute precision. Small phrasing diffs (e.g., "€15,000 or more" vs. "≥ €15 000") compound under strictness.

Total reflects ~68% misalignment; perfect match = 10.0, no tolerance for extras/errors.
