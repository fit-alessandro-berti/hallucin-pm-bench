**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Format mismatch (major deduction: -4.0 base)**: LLM outputs full BPMN 2.0 XML-in-JSON (with `bpmn:definitions`, namespaces, `bpmndi:BPMNDiagram`, shapes/edges layout) — extra diagram info not requested ("JSON representation of the process"). Ground truth is simplified custom JSON (`process_id`, `elements[]`, `flows[]`). Structures incomparable; no matching keys/arrays/ids.
- **Semantic/logic errors (major deductions)**:
  - Parallel logging: Broken/malformed. Task_6 ("Log") has invalid `incoming: "SequenceFlow_8"` (SF8 targets ParallelGateway_1 instead). No proper fork/join for log || wait; SF9 duplicated/conflicting sources. Ground has explicit fork/join post-provideResolution for sendResponse || logSolution (-1.5).
  - Wait/reply mechanism: Fundamentally wrong. Uses immediate ExclusiveGateway_2 ("Customer Reply?") post-fork with conditions — no waiting, can't detect reply asynchronously. TimerCatchEvent_1 has multiple invalid incomings (SF11 + SF15), triggered only on "No Reply" path. Ground uses correct eventBasedGateway + messageCatch/timerCatch (-1.8).
  - Customer cancel: Incomplete ("at any point before closure"). Single BoundaryEvent on Task_1 (early only); unnecessary IntermediateThrowEvent + malformed terminateEndEvent (invalid `terminateEventDefinition` on endEvent). Ground has cancelEvent (message) -> terminate, unattached but listed (-0.8).
- **Missing elements/flows (deductions)**: No eventBasedGateway, no message catch for reply, no joinAfterLogging, no exact flow conditions/ids/names matching ground (e.g., no "condition": "simple"). Extra invalid elements (throwEvent, wrong end).
- **Partial matches (+credits)**: Correct tasks (Create Ticket, Initial Classification, Root Cause Analysis, Provide Resolution, Send Response, Send Reminder, Close Ticket); classification XOR with labels; resolution merge; timer "PT24H"; parallel attempt; reminder -> close merge; start/close ends (+3.3 total).
- **Minor issues**: Name diffs (e.g., "Support Email Received" vs "Email Received"; no "parsed" task but ok); no parse invention; no escalation hallucination; executable `@isExecutable: true`.

Total: Starts at 10.0, cumulative deductions to 3.2. Strict per instruction — even wiring errors/format = significant loss.
