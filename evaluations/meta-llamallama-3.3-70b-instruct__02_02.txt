The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content, structure, and factual accuracy for all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 lists the exact sequence for C002; Q3 identifies and orders the two distinct preceding activities alphabetically, one per line. No errors, omissions, additions, or hallucinations are present, even under strict evaluation. Minor formatting variations (e.g., numbering vs. bullets) do not deviate from the prompt's requirements.
