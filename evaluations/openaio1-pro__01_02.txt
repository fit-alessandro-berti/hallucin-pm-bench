7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, capturing all core decision points and required documents without introducing prohibited standard loan terminology. It adheres closely to the prompt's exact activity names (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)"). However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth warrant significant deductions:

#### Decision Points (Score Impact: -1.5 total)
- **Strengths**: All three decision points are correctly identified and described with precise conditions (e.g., score difference ≤2, amount thresholds, board vote). Branching logic matches exactly.
- **Errors/Differences**:
  - Includes unnecessary step numbers (e.g., "Step 5") and specific next-step references (e.g., "continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)"), which the ground truth omits for brevity—adding interpretive detail not in the ground truth (-0.5).
  - Describes escalation as "the application is escalated... and then proceeds," slightly more verbose than ground truth's concise "escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break" (-0.5).
  - In Final Micro-loan Board Approval, adds "based on the outcome of previous steps" (extraneous) and uses lowercase italics (*approve* or *reject*) vs. ground truth's bold uppercase (**Approve** or **Reject**) (-0.5).

#### Required Documents (Score Impact: -1.0 total)
- **Strengths**: Lists all six exact documents from the prompt without additions or omissions of items. Uses bullet points, which is functionally equivalent to ground truth's numbering.
- **Errors/Differences**:
  - Minor wording expansions: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's shortened "(≤ 3 months)" (-0.3); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" adds "single" (from prompt but omitted in ground truth) (-0.3); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" adds "template" (from prompt but omitted) (-0.3).
  - Omits the ground truth's closing note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), which reinforces the prompt's non-standard emphasis— a meaningful interpretive omission (-0.1, but amplified under strictness).

#### Overall Structure and Adherence (Score Impact: -0.0)
- Formatting is clear and professional (e.g., sections, bolding), but includes extraneous intro ("Below is a concise overview...") and divider lines not in ground truth—neutral, as they don't alter meaning.
- No major factual errors, hallucinations, or deviations from the process flow.

Base score starts at 10.0 for near-perfect alignment; deductions total -3.0 for cumulative small differences, yielding 7.0 rounded up slightly for strong overall fidelity. Further strictness could lower it more, but the response remains substantively correct and useful.
