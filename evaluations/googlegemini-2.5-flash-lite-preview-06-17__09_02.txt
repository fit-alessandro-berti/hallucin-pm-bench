The LLM answer is correct in stating that average cycle time cannot be determined due to lack of timestamps, and does mention that time information is necessary. However, it is slightly less specific and comprehensive compared to the ground truth answer. The ground truth explicitly points out that only event counts are given and that the required intervals (start to completion) are absent, which strengthens the clarity and completeness of the justification. This nuance—specifying that only event counts are given and that intervals are absent—is missing from the LLM answer, resulting in a one-point deduction.
