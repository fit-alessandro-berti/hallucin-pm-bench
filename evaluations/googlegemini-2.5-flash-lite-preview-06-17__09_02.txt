The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of calculation due to absent timestamps and provides a concise explanation, aligning closely with the ground truth in intent and structure. However, it loses a full point for minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; referencing "lifecycle transitions" without explicitly noting "event counts" or "start-to-completion intervals"), which slightly reduce precision under strict evaluation.
