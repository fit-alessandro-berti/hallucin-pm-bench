9.0

The LLM answer correctly and thoroughly states that it is impossible to compute the requested metrics, explicitly citing the absence of event rows and timestamp values in Artefact A. It also clarifies that Artefact B contains only general statistics not applicable to the requested calculations. 

However, compared to the ground truth (“Impossible — the necessary data are absent...”), the LLM answer is more verbose and slightly over-explains by referencing not only the lack of data but also reiterating that Artefact B does not contain relevant information. While this is not wrong, it is wordier than necessary and not as concise as the model answer asked for in the instructions. The phrase “do not guess or draw on outside knowledge” was respected.

A further, very minor issue: the LLM answer redundantly restates the task’s impossibility in more than one way, where a single, direct statement would better match the task’s spirit and ground truth brevity. For maximal strictness, this surplus explanation justifies a one-point deduction. 

Therefore, the appropriate score is 9.0.
