The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in identifying the impossibility of computation due to redacted data in Artefact A, emphasizing the absence of timestamps for "Approve Invoice." It correctly avoids any guessing or external knowledge, provides a precise reason in one short paragraph, and addresses both required metrics (average, SD, CI). Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., polite phrasing like "I'm sorry" and brief mention of Artefact B's irrelevance, which is true but not emphasized in the ground truth) and not explicitly stating "additional raw log entries are required," though this is implied.
