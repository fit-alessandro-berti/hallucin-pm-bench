2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Minor Positive)**: The LLM answer strictly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without deviations, matching the ground truth's adherence. This prevents a complete 1.0 score but is outweighed by structural issues.
- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Major Deviation, -4.0 Penalty)**: The informal description has 6 steps, but the LLM expands to 8 tasks (e.g., splitting step 5 into "Release payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent"; adding a separate "Notify Regulatory Liaison" task not explicitly listed as a standalone activity). Ground truth consolidates into exactly 6 tasks with precise mapping (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" covers logging; "Archive Record" covers archiving without splitting notification). This introduces unsubstantiated additions/expansions, violating "covers every task" without omissions or substitutions.
- **Roles Included (Major Deviation, -2.0 Penalty)**: LLM limits roles to Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support (faithful to the source text's explicit mentions and mandated terms). Ground truth incorrectly introduces "Operations Manager" (not in the informal description or mandated vocabulary), assigning it as Accountable (A) across most tasks. While LLM avoids this fabrication, the absence of a matching role column creates misalignment, as ground truth's table structure includes it.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deviation, -1.5 Penalty)**: Assignments are almost entirely mismatched. For example:
  - "Receive and log" (LLM: Transaction Analyst R/A only) vs. ground truth's distributed R (Transaction Analyst), A (Operations Manager), I (Regulatory Liaison), C (IT Support).
  - "Screen" (LLM: Transaction Analyst R/A) vs. ground truth: R (Transaction Analyst), A (Regulatory Liaisonâ€”incorrect per source, as clerk performs it).
  - "KYC Review" and "Approve": Both assign R/A to Regulatory Liaison in LLM (simplistic, single-role focus); ground truth distributes with Consulted (C) to Transaction Analyst and A to Operations Manager.
  - No Consulted (C) roles in LLM (noted as absent per description, but ground truth uses C extensively, e.g., IT Support C for screening/release). Informed (I) is minimal in LLM vs. widespread in ground truth.
  This ignores nuanced RACI principles (e.g., only one A per task in both, but ground truth spreads responsibility more accurately to source).
- **Formatting and Clarity (Minor Deviation, -0.5 Penalty)**: Markdown table is clear, with a key/legend similar to ground truth. However, task phrasings differ slightly (e.g., LLM's "Approve high-risk transaction" vs. ground truth's "Approve High-Risk Transactions"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"), and LLM's header/intro text adds extraneous explanation not in ground truth.
- **Overall Strictness**: Per instructions, even small mismatches (e.g., task wording) incur significant loss; here, core structural/content differences (tasks, roles, assignments) indicate the LLM answer fails to replicate the ground truth's interpretation, resulting in a low score despite vocabulary fidelity.
