4.0

**Reasoning for Scoring:**

- **Role Naming Compliance:**  
  The answer uses only the mandated terms for roles: “Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”, and “IT Support”. However, *"Operations Manager"* from the ground truth was omitted entirely, while some sentences in the ground truth mark this role as “A”. The prompt did not specify to omit or rename "Operations Manager", so strictly, failure to account for this role is a notable error.

- **Activity Naming Accuracy:**  
  The answer does reasonably well in using the mandated activity terms (e.g., "KYC Review"). However, some task titles ("Perform KYC Review", "Approve high-risk transaction") are not phrased identically to those in the ground truth ("KYC Review", "Approve High-Risk Transactions"), which is a small but meaningful divergence under strict marking. Also, “Archive case file” is not verbatim the mandated “Archive Record”.

- **Tasks Coverage and Mapping:**  
  Some tasks are split or lumped (e.g., “Notify Regulatory Liaison” is unnecessary; ground truth distributes “Informed” status via the table), and the mapping doesn’t include the exact order/naming as the ground truth. Also, the "Consulted" (C) role is essentially omitted for every row, with a side note – but the ground truth assigns "C" in several places. Failure to reflect explicit “C” assignments is a significant omission.

- **RACI Matrix Structure:**  
  The answer uses "R, A" for the same cell (e.g., Transaction Analyst is both Responsible and Accountable for multiple tasks), whereas the ground truth splits these between roles, aligning with standard RACI best practices of separating “A” and “R” when they are different people/roles. 

- **Coverage of Ground Truth:**  
  The answer omits "Operations Manager" and does not assign “C” (Consulted) or “I” (Informed) properly on many tasks (as compared to the ground truth answer). The last row ("Notify Regulatory Liaison") is an unnecessary extra not present in the ground truth. Several activities are not phrased according to the explicit mandate (e.g., “Archive case file” vs. “Archive Record”).

**Conclusion:**  
Many of the mandated terms are followed, but not all, and there is substantial deviation from the required RACI structure and completeness—especially omitting the “Consulted” role assignments and "Operations Manager". For these reasons, significant marks must be lost. The answer is not faithful enough to the prompt or the ground truth, justifying a score of **4.0**.
