9.5

The LLM answer is precise, clear, and does not draw from outside knowledge. It accurately states that the statistics cannot be computed due to the absence of event data and timestamp values in Artefact A. It specifically references the redaction of rows and timestamps, correctly connecting this to the inability to measure durations for "Approve Invoice." This fully addresses all computation requests as per the prompt's instructions.

Slight loss of points (0.5) is warranted for minor phrasing differences and because the Ground Truth answer briefly mentions the need for "raw log entries" to proceed, which the LLM omits. While the LLM answer sufficiently explains "why" no calculations are possible, the omission of a phrase about the requirement for actual event data ("additional raw log entries are required") makes its recitation of the limitation a shade less complete than the Ground Truth. 

However, the core logic and explicitness are a close match.
