The LLM answer is nearly perfect, with exact matches on questions 1, 2a, and 2b (correct counts, calculations, and rounding to two decimals). For question 3, the response is concise (78 words), addresses the single-occurrence issue (explicitly notes "only 1 out of 48 events and 1 in 12 cases"), notes variance/instability (via "sparse data" distorting statistics like averages and paths, implying unreliability), and cautions against over-generalization (warns of overstating importance or incorrect modeling from the slice). Minor deduction for not explicitly referencing "noise," "confidence intervals," or "single observation skewing" as in the ground truth sample, slightly broader focus on "impact" rather than pure statistical vulnerability.
