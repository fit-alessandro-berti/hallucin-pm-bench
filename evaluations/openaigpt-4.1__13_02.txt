**Score: 9.0**

**Evaluation:**

- For Q1, the LLM correctly states **1** occurrence.
- For Q2a, the calculation \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 = 2.08\% \) is correct, matching the numeric ground truth.
- For Q2b, \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 = 8.33\% \) is also correct.
- For Q3, the LLM’s explanation states clearly that the statistic is based on only 1 observation, and gives appropriate warnings: “its impact ... is minimal in this log excerpt”, “Generalising from such sparse data may overstate its importance, cause models to incorrectly treat it as typical, or distort performance statistics (e.g., average activity duration or paths).” The answer mentions overestimation, distortion, and unreliability of conclusions, fulfilling the requirements (i)-(iii) in the ground truth assessment.

**Minor issues:**
- The Q3 answer could have been a touch stronger in specifically noting variance/instability and the impact of future cases on metrics (e.g., “if future data has zero such events, estimates collapse”), but the current phrasing is sufficient.
- The explanation is succinct, accurate, and does not invent information; a very small deduction only because it is vaguer than the model “confidence intervals remain wide” statement.

**Overall:**  
All numeric answers are exact and the explanation is clearly correct, but just slightly less detailed than the sample ground truth—so 9.0/10.
