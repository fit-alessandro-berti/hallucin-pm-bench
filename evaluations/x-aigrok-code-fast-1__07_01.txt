8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences: the two added tasks (check_vip and generate_qr), the one removed task (send_rma_label), and the gateway type change for gw_valid from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway. No extraneous information is included, and no speculation occurs, aligning with the prompt's requirements.

However, under utmost strictness, deduct points for the following small but noticeable differences from the ground truth:

- Headings use "###" markdown instead of "**bold**" formatting, deviating from the ground truth's style (though both clearly denote headings, this is not exact).
- List items use "-" bullets instead of "*" italics-style bullets.
- In added and removed tasks, the order is reversed (id first, then name in parentheses) compared to ground truth (name first, then "(id = `id`)"). The LLM omits the explicit "id = " phrasing and backticks around IDs, reducing precision in referencing XML elements.
- For the gateway change, the LLM lacks backticks around the ID ("gw_valid"), bolding of gateway types, and the "(v1)" and "(v2)" version specifiers, which provide clearer XML traceability.

These formatting and presentation inconsistencies, while not altering facts, warrant a deduction of 1.5 points from a perfect 10.0, as they prevent an exact match to the ground truth's structure and emphasis.
