**9.8**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect but loses minor points for small deviations: (1) "Once" + extra details (case/timestamp) vs. ground truth's concise "**1**" (unnecessary elaboration, though accurate); (2) formatting of % (non-breaking space " %" vs. " %"); (3) strong match to criteria (single occurrence, instability via distortion/noise/outlier, over-generalization caution) and ≤100 words (~72), but adds role-specific terms (e.g., "bottleneck detection") slightly beyond minimal data-derived explanation. All math/content exact; strict but not zero-tolerance on phrasing.
