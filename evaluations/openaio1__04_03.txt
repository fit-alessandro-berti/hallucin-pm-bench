9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, supplying a correct overall verdict ("No"), referencing each rule, and identifying which rules are satisfied or violated with supporting reasons.

The main difference from the ground truth is in the level of detail:  
- The LLM answer uses brief bullet points and not a tabular justification (minor formatting difference).
- The justifications are very concise, lacking explicit statements about NA needing to wait for *both* QE and RA (instead saying "before RA has completed," which does imply the problem, but is less explicit than the ground truth).
- It omits the summary sentence ("Because rule 3 is violated, the trace is non-compliant").

Per instructions to deduct significant points for even small errors, these minor lapses in explicitness and detail, plus a minor omission in summary, result in a 1-point deduction, so the score is **9.0**.
