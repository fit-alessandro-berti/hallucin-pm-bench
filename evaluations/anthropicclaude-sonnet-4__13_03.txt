### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1 Accuracy (8/10)**: Correct count of 1 occurrence, directly matching ground truth. Minor deduction for extraneous details (case ID and timestamp), which exceed the strict "exact activity string" query and introduce unrequested specifics from the data.
- **Q2 Accuracy (9/10)**: Strong overlap in highlighting small sample size (3 cases, limited timeframe) and naming inconsistencies (e.g., variants like "Automatic Fraud Check"), which could distort estimates via exact matching. Word count compliant (â‰ˆ95 words). However, deducts for mild speculation on unseen full-log variants (e.g., "Manual Fraud Check (Extended)"), violating "no speculation" rule, and less emphasis on ground truth's core statistical sampling error (e.g., % variability, confidence intervals) compared to data quality framing.
- **Overall**: High fidelity but strict penalties for speculation and incomplete statistical depth reduce from perfect.
