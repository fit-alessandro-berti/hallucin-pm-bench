8.0

**Rationale:**

**Question 1:**  
The LLM answer is fully correctâ€”"Manual Fraud Check" appears exactly once. No deduction.

**Question 2:**  
The answer is strong, covering key points:
- Notes the snippet's small, unrepresentative size.
- References the limited temporal coverage.
- Highlights inconsistent naming conventions ("Manual Fraud Check", "Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)").
- Warns about data quality and string matching issues.

**Differences and Errors:**  
- The LLM makes a good point about naming variance, but the mention of possible variants like "Manual Fraud Check (Extended)" or "Fraud Check (Manual)" is speculative and goes beyond the provided data, slightly straying from the "strictly from the data" instruction.
- It does not clearly and quantitatively state that the sample is so small that even one extra/missing case dramatically alters percentage, as referenced in the ground truth ("swings the apparent frequency from 0% to 7%").
- It alludes to time-of-day or application-type differences in frequency, again going beyond the immediate data.
- The LLM does not explicitly state the confidence interval is very wide or use statistical sampling/error language.
- The ground truth more precisely discusses why rare event frequency is particularly unstable in small, non-random samples. The LLM hints at this but with less rigor.

**Conclusion:**  
- Very good overall: recognizes main risks (tiny sample, variant names, limited time).
- Loses points for minor speculation and not stressing the statistical instability of rare event estimates as sharply as the ground truth.
- Therefore, 8.0/10.
