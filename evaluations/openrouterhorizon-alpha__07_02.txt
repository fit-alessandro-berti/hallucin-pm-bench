### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject) and the removed task (Task_RejectLoan), matching the ground truth content exactly. It also detects the core gateway-type change (from exclusive to inclusive) and groups everything under the exact required headings.
- **Major Errors (significant deductions)**: 
  - Includes irrelevant details in the gateway section: "(name changed from “Eligible?” to “Eligibility Check”)". This violates the explicit instruction to "Ignore cosmetic renamings", introducing extraneous information not present in the ground truth. Under strict evaluation, this is a direct rule violation warranting a heavy penalty (~3-point deduction).
  - Uses XML tag names ("exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway") instead of semantic BPMN types ("exclusive (XOR) to inclusive (OR)"), which is less precise and deviates from the ground truth's explanation of gateway behavior (~1-point deduction).
- **Minor Errors (additional deductions)**: 
  - Formatting inconsistencies: Bullet points vs. numbered lists; ID-first vs. name-first presentation with bold/code styling; no version references (e.g., "in v1 to v2") or closing note about completeness (~0.5-point deduction total). These are small but, per instructions, reflect in point loss.
- **Overall**: Content accuracy is ~80% due to the rule violation and imprecision, but strictness demands penalizing deviations harshly. No other changes (e.g., flows, renamings elsewhere) are incorrectly added, avoiding further loss.
