9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. Here is a breakdown of the minor issues that prevent a perfect score:

- The LLM answer includes the gateway name change ("name changed from “Eligible?” to “Eligibility Check”") which was explicitly instructed to be ignored per the prompt ("Ignore cosmetic renamings..."). This is a small, but clear, deviation.
- The rest of the content (all tasks added, removed, and the gateway type change itself) is exactly correct, uses both the technical IDs and user labels, and the structure exactly matches the requested headings.
- There is a very minor difference in how the gateway type change is described; the ground truth mentions "exclusive (XOR)... inclusive (OR)" for completeness, but the LLM is slightly less explicit ("exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway"), though it is still unambiguous.

Due to the infringement of the "ignore name changes" instruction, and slightly less precise form for expert context, the answer loses a point. Thus, the score is **9.0**.
