8.0

The LLM answer is nearly correct but with a notable formatting error, which warrants a significant point deduction as per your instruction to penalize even small errors strictly.

**Comparison with Ground Truth:**
- **Task selection:** The LLM answer lists only the two valid pairs and has not included any incorrect pairs. This matches the ground truth regarding task pairing.
- **Alphabetical order within each pair:** Both pairs are correctly ordered alphabetically within the LLM answer. "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" (C before Q) and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" (P before S) are correct.
- **Alphabetical order of lines:** "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" precedes "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" alphabetically, matching the ground truth and following instruction.
- **Formatting:** The LLM failed to align the em-dash in the second pair, unlike the ground truth, which uses spaces to align the em-dash in both lines:
    - LLM: `Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`
    - Ground truth: `Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines`
- **Quotation marks** and code block: The ground truth formats the answer in a code block; the LLM does not. This is a minor but still notable error per your strict standard.
- **Trailing spaces:** The ground truth has extra spaces to align the em dashes, which improves readability per instruction. The LLM omits this.

**Summary:**  
- Task identification and order: perfect (no points lost).
- Formatting (code block missing, alignment not matching ground truth): 2 points lost due to your requirement for strict grading down for *even small* errors.

**Final score:** 8.0
