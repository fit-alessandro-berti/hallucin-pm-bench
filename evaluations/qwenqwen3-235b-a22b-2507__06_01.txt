The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs of parallel tasks from Process B, lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format of one pair per line with "â€”". The output is semantically perfect and adheres to the prompt's instructions. The only minor differences are in whitespace/formatting (e.g., slight variations in spacing after task names and possible lack of alignment in the dashes, as well as no enclosing backticks or leading/trailing empty lines present in the ground truth presentation). Under utmost strictness, this results in a small deduction for not being an exact character-for-character match, but the differences are negligible and do not affect correctness or usability.
