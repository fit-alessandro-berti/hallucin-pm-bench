The LLM answer is a precise match to the ground truth across all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the exact sequence with proper ordering and separator; Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors alphabetically on separate lines with no additions, omissions, or errors. Minor formatting variations (e.g., bolding, explanations, or bullet styles) do not introduce factual deviations and align with the prompt's requirements for content accuracy.
