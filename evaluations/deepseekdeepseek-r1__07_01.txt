The LLM answer accurately identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), using exact XML element IDs and names without speculation. However, it loses points for minor formatting deviations from the ground truth: reversed order of ID and name in task listings (ID first vs. name first), lack of version labels "(v1)" and "(v2)" in the gateway change, absence of the explanatory note, and use of "###" headings with "-" bullets instead of "**bold**" with "*" italics. These small inconsistencies warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria, but the core content is nearly identical.
