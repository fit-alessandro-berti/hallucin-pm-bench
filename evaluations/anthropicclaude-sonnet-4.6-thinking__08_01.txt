**9.5**

The LLM answer is highly accurate, correct, and fully responsive to the prompt: affirms "Yes" with a valid, minimal concrete firing sequence (T1→T2→T5) demonstrating T5 fires before T3 ever does, complete with precise markings, table format for clarity, and brief justification centered on the inhibitor arc enabling the race condition. No factual errors (unlike ground truth's invalid T4 firing after T5 consumes p3). Substantive content matches closely: same core sequence, same enabling logic (p3≥1 ∧ p4=0 pre-T3), same independence of branches.

Minor differences (strictly penalized but not significantly): 
- Lacks ground truth's extra "must if ever to occur" claim + permanence proof (deeper analysis not required by prompt's "justify briefly," but adds distinction; -0.3).
- Shorter sequence (stops post-T5; sufficient, as T3 un-fired in reachable marking; ground truth erroneously extends to impossible T4; -0.1).
- Stylistic/format variances (table vs. list, full vs. abbreviated markings, added diagram; clear but divergent; -0.1).

Overall, excellent fidelity with trivial divergences.
