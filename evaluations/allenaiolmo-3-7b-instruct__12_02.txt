**3.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" but contains critical factual errors in justification, severely undermining accuracy: it falsely claims *Validate_Payment* precedes *Receive_Order* for C002 ("line 5 before line 3"), which is incorrect as line 3 (Receive_Order at 09:02Z) precedes line 5 (Validate_Payment at 09:07Z) for C002, making this a fabricated counterexample. It misses the clear C003 counterexample (line 6 before line 7) highlighted in ground truth. C005 is partially correct but incompletely phrased ("no preceding... in the fragment" vs. ground truth's "never contains... at all"). It erroneously adds "immediately" to the claim (not present) and uses vague "multiple instances" without full precision. Structure approximates "one paragraph" but deviates from ground truth's bulleted format; overall, major deviations and errors warrant substantial deduction under strict criteria.
