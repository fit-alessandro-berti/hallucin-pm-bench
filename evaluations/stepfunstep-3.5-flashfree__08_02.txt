**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it wrongly claims "No" for Q1 (ground truth: "Yes"), misinterpreting the question as requiring *both* T3 and T5 to fire (it does not; T5 firing with T3 not yet fired suffices). The bonus explanation falsely assumes mutual exclusivity prevents T5 preceding T3, ignoring the path T1→T2→T7→T4 that enables {P2,P5} for T5 without T3. No valid sequence provided; zero alignment with ground truth sequence or reasoning. Strict deduction for core factual error.
