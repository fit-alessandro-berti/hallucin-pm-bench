The LLM answer is accurate, correctly identifies "No" as the response, and provides a solid justification by citing the exact counterexamples (C002 and C004) with precise sequences and timestamps, while noting the non-counterexamples (C001 and C003) to affirm the "always" claim's failure. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core content and logic. However, under utmost strictness, the LLM loses a small point for not presenting an exhaustive case-by-case analysis in a structured table format like the ground truth (instead using selective bullets with a parenthetical note), which makes it slightly less comprehensive in presentation despite covering all relevant cases. No factual errors or omissions in evidence citation.
