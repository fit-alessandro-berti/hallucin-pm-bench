The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include: (1) Incorrect columns—LLM omits "Operations Manager" (present in ground truth) and reorders roles, violating structural fidelity. (2) Excessive and inaccurate task fragmentation—LLM expands to 8 rows (e.g., splitting release/send into separate tasks 5/6, adding a non-existent task 8 for notification), while ground truth consolidates into exactly 6 rows matching the source text's steps without additions or splits. (3) Fundamentally mismatched RACI assignments across all rows (e.g., ground truth assigns "A" predominantly to Operations Manager for accountability; LLM incorrectly doubles up "R/A" on Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison, and misplaces "C/I" roles like no "I" for Regulatory Liaison in receive/screen). (4) Task phrasings differ (e.g., LLM's "Receive and Log Payment Instructions" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; no bolding of "**KYC Review**" as in ground truth). (5) Extraneous elements—LLM includes unprompted "Notes" section with interpretations (e.g., assuming consultations "if required"), which adds unsubstantiated content not in ground truth or prompt. Even minor variances like row numbering, legend formatting, and I notations (e.g., LLM's "I (notified)" vs. simple "I") compound the errors, resulting in near-total mismatch.
