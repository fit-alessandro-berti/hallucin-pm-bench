4.0

**Justification for Score:**

There are multiple serious errors and deviations from the requirements, reflecting a low but not utterly failing score:

**Strict vocabulary adherence:**  
- The answer follows the mandated terms (*Transaction Analyst*, *Regulatory Liaison*, *KYC Review*) without impermissible substitutions — this preserves some merit.

**Process and role inaccuracies:**
- The LLM invents several tasks not present in the ground truth or the source:
    - “Notify Regulatory Liaison of Case File Archival” (nowhere in source).
    - “Ensure SWIFT Message is Sent” as a standalone task (SWIFT message is only a sub-action in approval/release).
- Task splitting and redundancies reduce alignment and clarity.
- There is no *Operations Manager* role present, which the ground truth includes. Missing this key RACI position is a significant deduction.

**Assignments of RACI responsibilities:**
- The LLM often assigns both R and A for routine steps (e.g., screening, receiving), whereas ground truth properly splits these, with *Accountable* resting on the *Operations Manager.*
- Consulted and Informed fields are sometimes invented or inconsistently mapped.
- IT Support’s roles are improperly weighted and not matched to ground truth (for example, assigned C in unnecessary places).

**Task Naming and Process Mapping:**
- Task names often depart from the enforced/ground truth wording (“Receive and Log Payment Instructions”, “Screen Payment Against Sanctions”), thus weakening the match.
- LLM overcomplicates by splitting archival notification into a separate task.

**Format:**
- Markdown is used as requested.

**Summary of deductions:**
- Major structure/role/taxonomy difference (missing Operations Manager): -2.0 points
- Over-complicating/splitting tasks and adding non-sourced activities: -2.0 points
- RACI assignment and role mapping lacking faithfulness: -1.5 points
- Deviations in task naming/wording: -0.5 points

**Conclusion:**  
This answer displays basic vocabulary compliance but deviates extensively from the ground truth in structure, role set, mapping, and accuracy; errors are significant but not utterly total, so the answer earns a **4.0**.
