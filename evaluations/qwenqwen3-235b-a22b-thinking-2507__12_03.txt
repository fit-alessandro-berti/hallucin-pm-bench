The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in accuracy, coverage of all relevant cases (explicitly noting compliant cases C001/C003 and violations in C002/C004), citation of sequences, and reasoning that "always" is falsified by counterexamples. Differences are purely stylistic (narrative vs. tabular format), with no factual errors, omissions, or deviations.
