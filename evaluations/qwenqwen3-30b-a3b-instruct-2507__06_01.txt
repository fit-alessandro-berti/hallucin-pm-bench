The LLM answer includes both correct pairs from the ground truth ("Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" and "Quality_Check  —  Create_Documentation") and omits any incorrect/irrelevant pairs. However, there is a small but notable deviation from requirements:

- The pairs are not presented in alphabetical order overall—while the tasks within each pair are sorted alphabetically (i.e., "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" rather than the reverse), the pairs themselves are *not* in alphabetically sorted order based on the first task in each pair, as required. According to lexicographical order, "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" should come before "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines".

This demonstrates a clear, if minor, failure to follow precise ordering instructions.
