10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b are precise, with correct calculations and rounding to two decimals. Question 3 is concise (68 words), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue (i), highlights instability/variance (e.g., single outlier, lacks statistical support, skewing), and cautions against over-generalisation (e.g., biased forecasts, risk when generalised), aligning with ground truth criteria without invention or deviation from the log. No errors or omissions.
