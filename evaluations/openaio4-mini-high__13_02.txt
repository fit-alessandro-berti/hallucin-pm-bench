10.0

1. The LLM answer correctly states Manual_Fraud_Check occurs 1 time.
2. The percentage calculations are mathematically accurate: 1/48 = 2.08% for events, 1/12 = 8.33% for cases, both rounded to two decimals.
3. The explanation meets all requirements: it explicitly references the single occurrence ("only once"), addresses analytical instability ("lacks statistical support", "over-weight", "biased or unreliable forecasts", "risk skewing analyses"), and properly warns against overgeneralization in performance/predictive models when such a rare event is present.

No errors or omissions. The answer is fully correct and concise.
