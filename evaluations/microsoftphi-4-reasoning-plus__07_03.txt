The LLM answer correctly identifies all the verifiable functional changes (added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway type changes) matching the ground truth content exactly, with no additions, omissions, or errors in the listed elements. However, it severely violates the output instructions by including extensive extraneous commentary, reasoning, and analysis (over 90% of the response), which the prompt explicitly forbids ("add no commentary," "output must contain only the three required headings and the concrete differences"). This alone warrants a major deduction under strict evaluation criteria. Additionally, minor formatting differences include: lack of bullet points (-) before each item (ground truth uses them consistently); extra blank lines and inconsistent spacing after headings (e.g., two spaces in LLM vs. none in ground truth); and no indentation for the second gateway line in ground truth (which has extra spaces, but LLM lacks them). These small errors compound the structural failure, preventing an exact match.
