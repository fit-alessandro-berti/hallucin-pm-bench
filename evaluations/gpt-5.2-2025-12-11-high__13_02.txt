**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete:
- Q1: Exact match (**1**).
- Q2a/b: Exact matches (**2.08%**, **8.33%**) with correct calculations shown.
- Q3: ≤100 words (87 words); hits all required elements—(i) single occurrence (explicitly states "only 1 occurrence (1 case)"), (ii) variance/instability ("too rare... dominated by a single instance... outlier rather than stable pattern"), (iii) over-generalisation caution ("fail to generalise", references "small slice"). Ties directly to performance/predictive analyses without inventing data. No errors or deviations.
