5.5

**Rationale for Scoring:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer correctly adheres to the STRICT vocabulary policy: only "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring" are used, never any synonyms, even in explanations.
- The output is formatted as a Markdown table and includes only the named activities (no renaming or merging).
- No unauthorized phrasings are present.

**Major Issues (substantial deductions):**
- The LLM omits two activities critical to strict process coverage: "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". Instead, it includes "Review High-Risk" and "Schedule Payment", which are not listed as explicit activities with those exact names in the process narrative or expected output.
- The roles and RACI markings are not always correctly applied:
  - For "Intake Vetting": the ground truth has "C" for Compliance Analyst and "I" for Treasury Ops, both missing.
  - For "KYC Review", "AML Screening": ground truth includes "C" for Compliance Officer and "I" for Treasury Ops, both missing.
  - For "Risk Scoring": LLM gives both R, A to Compliance Analyst, but ground truth assigns "A" to Compliance Officer and "C" to Front-Office Analyst (LLM has none).
  - "Review High-Risk" is not listed as an allowed activity; "Compliance Officer Approval" is missing.
  - "Schedule Payment" and its RACI assignments do not match ground truth's "Release Funds" assignments.
- The ground truth uses "â€“" for uninvolved roles; LLM leaves blank, a minor but relevant formatting difference.

**Other Flaws (further deductions):**
- The LLM's matrix is missing the "Compliance Officer Approval" row, and the "Release Funds" row is replaced (and renamed) by "Schedule Payment", which is not allowed.
- Consultation and information flows ("C"/"I") are missing or incompletely covered throughout for all activities.

**Conclusion:**  
While vocabulary is strictly followed, fundamental errors in completeness, RACI assignment, and unauthorized activity naming require a significant penalty. However, the correct use of mandated terms and the non-use of forbidden ones prevent a lower score. The answer demonstrates understanding of the vocabulary constraint but not of the strict process and RACI breakdown required.

**Thus, 5.5.**
