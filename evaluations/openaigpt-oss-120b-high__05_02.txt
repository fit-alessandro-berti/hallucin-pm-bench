6.0

The LLM answer correctly modifies only the allowed attribute (camunda:dueDate) of an existing element, provides a diff in the correct format, and gives a reasonable rationale matching the prompt and constraints. However, the chosen new due date ("P3D" instead of "P2D" as in the ground truth) is not as aggressive and may not be sufficient to guarantee SLA compliance if the downstream tasks' durations are also counted. This is a key quantitative discrepancy: the ground truth expects a reduction to "2 days" â€” a demonstrably stricter adjustment. This represents a nontrivial departure from the ground truth, which, under strict grading, warrants a significant deduction. However, the method is otherwise correct, so a mid-range score reflecting the flaw: 6.0.
