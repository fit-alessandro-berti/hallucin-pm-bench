The LLM answer correctly identifies all key factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, it deviates in formatting and phrasing from the ground truth: (1) lists tasks/gateways in verbose XML-attribute style (e.g., "task id="check_vip" name=...") instead of name-first with parenthetical id (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"); (2) omits backticks, bolding for gateway types, and version labels "(v1)/(v2)"; (3) lacks the closing note; (4) includes unnecessary element types like "task" and "gateway" in listings, which the prompt implies should stick to exact names/ids without extra XML verbosity. These are small but consistent presentation errors, warranting a deduction under strict evaluation, though semantic accuracy is strong.
