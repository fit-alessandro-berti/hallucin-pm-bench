The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order, with no extraneous information about other processes or tasks, fully matching the core content of the ground truth. Minor deductions for lacking the descriptive labels ("first parallel block," etc.), the explicit parallelism symbol (‖ instead of comma), markdown formatting (bold, backticks), and the confirmatory final sentence, which provide clearer structure and visual emphasis despite not being strictly required by the prompt.
