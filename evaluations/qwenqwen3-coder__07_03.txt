The LLM answer is nearly identical in content to the ground truth, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). The only differences are minor formatting omissions: lack of bullet points ("- ") before each item and no alignment spaces in the second gateway entry. These small structural variances deduct a slight amount under strict evaluation, but do not affect the factual accuracy or adherence to the core instructions.
