7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all the functional changes present and does not introduce any extraneous information. However, significant points must be deducted for formatting errors:

- The "id (name)" format for tasks must be `id (name)` and be prefixed with a dash (“-”) as in the ground truth. The LLM answer omits the dash/bullet style.  
- For "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES", the ground truth uses a dash and proper alignment, while the LLM answer omits both the dash and spacing after the colon on the second line.  
- The headings are in the correct order and correctly worded, but the lack of required bullet formatting for each changed element is a notable deviation.

All content is correct, but adherence to the strict requested output format is incomplete—hence a deduction from a perfect score.
