### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the strict vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without leaks or synonyms. However, it violates the prompt's explicit instruction to "do not rename, merge, or add activities" by introducing two extraneous activities ("Payment scheduling" and "Notification") not present in the ground truth, while also renaming others ("Approval (high-risk cases)" vs. "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Fund release" vs. "Release Funds"). This structural deviation alone warrants major deduction under strict criteria.

RACI assignments show numerous inaccuracies when compared to the ground truth:
- **Intake Vetting**: Misses "C" for Compliance Analyst and "I" for Treasury Ops.
- **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: Incorrectly assigns "I" to Front-Office Analyst (should be "-"); misses "C" for Compliance Officer and "I" for Treasury Ops; Compliance Analyst "R, A" is partially correct but incomplete without the consultations/informed roles.
- **Risk Scoring**: Fundamentally wrong—assigns "R, A" to Compliance Analyst, but ground truth specifies "C" for Front-Office Analyst, "R" for Compliance Analyst, "A" for Compliance Officer, and "I" for Treasury Ops.
- **Approval**: Renamed and adds "R" to Compliance Analyst (should be "C"); otherwise partially aligns.
- **Added rows (Payment scheduling, Notification)**: No ground truth equivalents; "Payment scheduling" could arguably derive from the narrative but is not in ground truth and splits what appears merged in "Release Funds". Introduces unsubstantiated "R" for Treasury Ops in "Notification" without accountability.
- **Fund release**: Misses "C" for both Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer.

Minor issues include lack of bolding/formatting for activities and "R, A" as in ground truth, and use of "-" vs. "–". These compound the errors. Overall, while the Markdown table format is correct and roles are covered, the high volume of additions, renamings, omissions, and misassignments (especially Consulted/Informed roles across multiple activities) results in low fidelity to the ground truth, justifying a minimal score under utmost strictness.
