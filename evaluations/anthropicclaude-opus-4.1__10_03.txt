4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates partial comprehension and partial compliance with strict requirements. Here's a breakdown of deductions and issues:

**Vocabulary Compliance (0 points deducted):**
- The answer correctly uses only the authorized terms (“Intake Vetting,” “KYC Review,” “AML Screening,” “Risk Scoring”) and does not introduce synonyms.
- No forbidden vocabulary is present.

**Structure (1 point deducted):**
- The LLM adds extra activities ("Approval (high-risk cases)", "Payment scheduling", "Fund release", "Notification") not present in the ground truth. The instructions explicitly say not to rename, merge, or add activities. This is a major breach.

**Coverage (2 points deducted):**
- Several required activities per the ground truth are missing or replaced: “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds” are replaced with or split into multiple non-authorized activities; “Notification” is extraneous.
- The LLM answer splits “Release Funds” into “Payment scheduling”, “Fund release”, and “Notification”, which does not match the ground truth’s list of activities or the process narrative granularity.

**Role Assignments (2 points deducted):**
- For "Risk Scoring", the LLM assigns "R, A" to the Compliance Analyst, but the ground truth correctly separates "R" (Compliance Analyst), "A" (Compliance Officer), and "C" (Front-Office Analyst). This is a major miss.
- “Compliance Officer Approval” is replaced with “Approval (high-risk cases)” and the RACI is incorrect (Accountable assigned to Compliance Officer, but Compliance Analyst assigned as Responsible); this should be “R, A” for Compliance Officer only.
- In most activities, “I” and “C” assignments do not match the ground truth, often omitting Consulted and Informed roles.
- "Intake Vetting": Missing “C” for Compliance Analyst and “I” for Treasury Ops.
- "KYC Review": Missing “C” for Compliance Officer and “I” for Treasury Ops.
- “AML Screening”: Missing “C” for Compliance Officer and “I” for Treasury Ops.
- “Release Funds”: distributed incorrectly over multiple lines.

**Formatting (1 point deducted):**
- Table and style are otherwise acceptable.

**Summary:**  
- The answer did not use unauthorized synonyms (no points off here).
- It failed to keep the correct set of activities (deduct 1 point).
- It distributed responsibility, consulted, and informed roles incorrectly (major errors, deduct 2 points).
- Misalignments in activity names and in how activities were combined and split, not matching the mandated activity list (deduct 2 points).
- Formatting and structural compliance (table in markdown) is generally okay (deduct 1 point for unnecessary renamed activities).

**Total deduction: 6 points off the baseline; final score: 4.0**
