7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3), with appropriate citations to the trace events. However, under utmost strictness: (1) it inaccurately states the distance for Rule 3 as 4 (ground truth specifies 3, a factual error in calculation/interpretation warranting significant deduction); (2) it provides no detailed justification for Rules 1, 4, or 5 (merely stating they are satisfied, unlike the ground truth's systematic, evidence-based checks for all rules); (3) minor structural differences, such as lacking an explicit check for Rule 5 (trace ending), reduce completeness despite the concise format aligning with the prompt's output style. These differences, even small, result in a substantial point loss from a perfect score.
