The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt's description. It adheres strictly to the user instructions by focusing only on Process B, numbering the sets sequentially, and providing no extraneous information about other processes.  

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for stylistic differences from ground truth under utmost strictness:  
- Lacks descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**").  
- Uses plain "and" instead of "‖" symbol for parallelism.  
- No backticks around task names.  
- Omits confirmatory sentence ("No other tasks..."), though not required by prompt.  

Semantically and functionally identical to ground truth; no factual errors.
