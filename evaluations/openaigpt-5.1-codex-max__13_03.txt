**8.2**

### Rationale:
- **Part 1 (perfect match)**: Both correctly identify 1 occurrence (+2.5/2.5). LLM uses prompt's emoji formatting and bolding, aligning well.
- **Part 2 (strong but imperfect)**: Core ideas overlap (tiny sample of 3 cases/14 events/short timeframe; variant fraud-check names like “Automatic Fraud Check”/“Fraud Check (Automatic)”; unreliability for monthly estimates) (+5.0/6.0). Both ≤120 words.
  - **Deductions (-0.8)**: Misses ground truth's key quantitative insight (frequency swings 0%-7%; wide confidence intervals; sampling error for rare events)—central to "misestimate how common." Less statistically precise.
  - **Minor deductions (-1.0)**: Adds unemphasized details (duplicate "Send Offer"/incomplete lifecycles)—accurate from data but tangential to manual fraud check frequency, diluting focus vs. ground truth's purity. No exact case/time citation.

Overall: High fidelity (80%+ semantic overlap), but strictness penalizes missing punchy stats/distortions and slight scope creep.
