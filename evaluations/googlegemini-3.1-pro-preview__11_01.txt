8.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Strengths (full credit):**
- **Correctness**: Perfect match on top 3 activities (ranked #1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability, strictly by avg waiting time order from table). Quotes verbatim: avg and p95 times exact (36.5/120.0, 12.2/44.0, 7.8/16.4).
- **No unwarranted content**: Zero mention of service-time, throughput, or other activities. Stays focused.
- **Structure & Length**: Crisp memo format (<150 words, ~110 words). Proper executive style with headers.

**Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness):**
- **Format/Structure differences** (-0.5): Full memo headers good, but deviates from GT's bare "#1 Activity – avg X h, p95 Y h. Action:" bullet style. Intro sentence adds non-GT content.
- **Action phrasing & data-driven claim** (-0.8): Actions concrete/relevant (tied to waiting causes, promise ≥20% in intro), but not "data-driven" like GT ("pilot tests show ≥25%", "estimated 30%", "targeting 20–25%"). LLM proposes logically but cites no data/estimates per action, weakening "data-driven" requirement. Wording differs substantially (e.g., LLM #1: SMS/portal vs. GT reminders/escalation; #2 RPA vs. e-signature; #3 triage juniors vs. pre-classification).
- **Small errors** (-0.5): Typo "bypassings" (should be "bypassing"). Minor quoting style ("36.5h average | 120.0h 95th-percentile" vs. GT "avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h" – fuller but not identical; omits ".0" in GT for p95).

**Overall**: 90% alignment (core facts perfect, actions functionally equivalent but differ in specificity/data-backing/format). Strict penalty for divergences yields 8.2.
