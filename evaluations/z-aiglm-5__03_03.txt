**4.0**

### Evaluation Summary (strict grading rationale):
- **Major deduction (-4.0 points)**: Hallucinated/extra task (`wrc_check_eligibility "Check warranty eligibility"`) and associated flows (`wrc_flow_gwcomp_check`, `wrc_flow_check_gwelig`). Ground truth (GT) omits this entirely, modeling step 3 solely as the exclusive gateway (`wrc_warranty_gw`) without a preceding task. Prompt specifies gateways for step 2 completeness and step 3 warranty decision but does not call for a separate task; LLM invented it despite "Model **only** the flow elements explicitly mentioned. Do **not** invent [...] beyond what is stated."
- **Major deduction (-1.0 point)**: Unnecessary full `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` section with ~40 shapes/edges (DI graphics, waypoints). GT is minimal logical model only (34 lines, no DI); prompt requests "BPMN 2.0 XML document" without requiring visuals, making this bloat/extra.
- **Medium deductions (-0.5 each, total -1.0)**: 
  - Non-verbatim task names (e.g., "Create shipment order" omits "for the replacement unit"; "Schedule courier pickup" omits "of the faulty product"). Prompt mandates "Task names must match the text **verbatim**." GT has same issue, but strict per-prompt violation.
  - Divergent gateway/end names (e.g., "Warranty Eligible?" vs GT "Within warranty?"; "Claim Complete?" vs "Claim complete?"; ends "End" vs "Successful end"/"Rejected"). Minor but cumulative under strictness.
  - `<bpmn:incoming>`/`<bpmn:outgoing>` attributes redundant (GT uses only `sourceRef`/`targetRef`).
- **Minor positives (no add-back)**: Correct prefix "wrc_" on all IDs; exactly 2 end events; required gateways (2 exclusive, parallel split/join); loop logic; parallel step 4; valid BPMN XML semantically close to process but deviated by extras.
- **Overall**: Semantically ~80% equivalent (flows/logic align except extra step), but strict rubric demands deduction for extras/omissions/inventions and exact match to GT/minimalism. Not "semantically equivalent" due to added task changing step 3 sequence.
