### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all required documents identically to the ground truth (exhaustive list of 7 items, with appropriate notes on scope and exclusions), earning full credit for that section. However, the decision points section shows substantial deviations, warranting a severe deduction under strict criteria:

- **Over-identification of decision points**: The ground truth concisely identifies exactly 3 decision points (eligibility check, amount threshold, and consolidated final approval). The LLM inflates this to 5 by splitting the approval logic into separate points for `Finance_Controller_PreApprove` and `Senior_Auditor_Review` (instead of treating them as a unified "final payment approval"), and erroneously introduces a new decision at `Process_Refund_Payment` (framing it as a "decision to execute" based on preconditions, which the process describes as a conditional execution activity, not a distinct decision point). This introduces unsubstantiated branching logic not present in the prompt's process description.

- **Interpretive additions and inaccuracies**: The LLM adds speculative details like "halts without explicit rejection documentation," "inherently involve decisions that could approve or deny," and explicit rejection paths at each step (e.g., "high-value claim is rejected and halts"), which go beyond summarizing the defined process and infer outcomes not explicitly stated. The ground truth sticks strictly to described logic (e.g., "claim rejected/returned" only for eligibility, "process ends without payment" for final approval). This violates the prompt's instruction to avoid introducing undefined elements.

- **Structural and fidelity issues**: The LLM's verbose, narrative summaries contrast with the ground truth's precise table format, leading to less clarity and more deviation in phrasing (e.g., "numerical threshold serves as the decision criterion" vs. ground truth's direct "Branching logic / outcomes"). Even minor elaborations (e.g., "cross-referencing it with..." for validation) reflect over-interpretation, treated as small errors per instructions.

These differences in completeness, accuracy, and adherence result in a low overall score, as the decision points comprise half the prompt's requirements and show clear expansion beyond the ground truth.
