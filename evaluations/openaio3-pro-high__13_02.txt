The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1, 2a, and 2b (deterministic numerics). For question 3, the explanation adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (85 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue, notes instability/variance (e.g., undue influence on metrics, overfitting, skewed insights), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., misleading decisions from the excerpt). No inventions or deviations from the log; wording variation is permissible per ground truth guidelines.
