10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct:

1. Identifies **1** occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check"—correct.  
2. Calculates event share as **2.08 %** (1/48 × 100) and case share as **8.33 %** (1/12 × 100)—both correct and rounded to two decimals.  
3. The short explanation covers all required points:
   - Explicitly mentions single-occurrence issue (“just one occurrence”).
   - Warns about instability/variance (“little statistical weight”, “unduly influence”, “overfitting”, “exaggerating”, “skewed insights”).
   - Advises on generalisation risk (“if we generalise from this excerpt”, “subsequent decisions ... may misallocate resources or misclassify”).
   - Does not invent or add data beyond the supplied log.
