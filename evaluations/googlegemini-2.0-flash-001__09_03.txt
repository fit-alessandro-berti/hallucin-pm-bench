9.0

The LLM answer accurately states that it is impossible to compute the requested metrics due to the absence of data in the event log stub, which matches the spirit of the ground truth answer. However, it loses 1 point for the following reasons:

- The explanation could have been even more concise and direct, as in the ground truth ("Impossible — the necessary data are absent."). The LLM’s wording is slightly longer and not quite as crisp.
- The LLM mentions “within each case” and details about needing resource and timestamps, which, while accurate, slightly expand beyond the strict scope. The ground truth succinctly lists what’s missing and what’s needed in precise terms.

Given the high similarity and correctness, but slight verbosity and lack of the word “Impossible” as the direct answer up front, a deduction to 9.0 is appropriate.
