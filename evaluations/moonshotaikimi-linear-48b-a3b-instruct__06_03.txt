The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two concurrent task sets in the exact order, with accurate task names and no extraneous information about other processes. However, it loses points for minor strict deviations from the ground truth: lack of descriptive labels (e.g., "first parallel block"), absence of the concluding sentence ("No other tasks..."), no bolding or symbolic notation (e.g., ‖ or backticks), and a slightly different phrasing ("and" instead of structured parallelism indicator). These formatting and stylistic differences, while not altering the core content, warrant a deduction under utmost strictness for not fully mirroring the ground truth's presentation.
