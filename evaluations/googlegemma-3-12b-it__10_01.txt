4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Adherence (Vocabulary Policy)**: Perfect match (10/10). The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere.
- **Structure and Formatting**: Partial match (6/10). The matrix format is similar (rows for activities, columns for roles), with activities in the correct order and roles abbreviated as specified. Headers are comparable, though the LLM adds bolding and an unnecessary RACI key/explanation (unwarranted content per rubric, deducting points). No extra tasks or roles introduced, which is good.
- **RACI Allocations (Core Content)**: Poor match (1/10). This is the primary failure point, with major deviations from the ground truth:
  - **Responsible (R)**: Correctly identifies the single primary R per activity based on the process narrative (e.g., AM for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Notify Customer; CO for KYC Review; FC for Payment Clearance; IT for Record Update). This aligns loosely with the rubric's "one Responsible" rule.
  - **Accountable (A)**: Incorrect. The LLM implies A via R but never explicitly assigns it, and misses key ground truth assignments (e.g., AM as A for KYC Review and Payment Clearance, even when not R). Ground truth shows AM as A/R combined where AM performs, and A separately elsewhereâ€”LLM ignores this entirely.
  - **Consulted (C) and Informed (I)**: Completely absent (all "-"). Ground truth assigns these pervasively (e.g., CO as C for Receive Application/Order Vetting; FC as C for KYC Review; multiple I's across roles). This omits critical interactions implied in a full RACI for the workflow, leading to an oversimplified/incomplete matrix.
  - Overall, every row differs significantly from ground truth (no row matches exactly), violating the rubric's emphasis on allocations reflecting the narrative (including appropriate AM accountability and broader role involvements). Strictness penalty: Even partial correctness in R doesn't offset the wholesale missing elements.
- **Unwarranted Content**: Minor issue (7/10). The added RACI key, notes on implications ("R implies Accountability"), and general explanation are not in the ground truth and exceed the prompt's scope (just "produce a RACI matrix"). However, they don't introduce extras like new tasks/roles.
- **Overall Correctness and Self-Awareness**: Low (2/10). While terminology and basic structure show awareness of the prompt, the matrix fails to deliver a comprehensive RACI that "reflects the narrative" as per rubric (narrative implies workflow interdependencies, which ground truth captures via C/I/A). No self-awareness issues noted, but incompleteness is a critical error.

**Total Score Calculation**: Weighted heavily toward RACI allocations (50%), terminology (20%), structure (15%), unwarranted content (10%), correctness (5%). Averages to 4.0, reflecting partial credit for basics but severe deductions for mismatched/incomplete content. Small errors (e.g., implied vs. explicit A) compound with major ones (missing C/I), justifying significant point loss under strictness rules.
