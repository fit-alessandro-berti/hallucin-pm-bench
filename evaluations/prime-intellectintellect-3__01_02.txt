8.5

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high alignment, preserving ~85% fidelity)**:
  - Correctly identifies **exactly the 3 decision points** matching ground truth: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
  - Conditions and logic for each decision point are accurate and use **exact terminology** from prompt (e.g., ≤2 points, Harmonisation Committee, <€15 000 auto-approves, ≥€15 000 to MBA, board votes approve/reject).
  - **Required documents** list is **complete and exact** (all 6 items present, no additions/omissions, no standard loan terms introduced).
  - No hallucinations or inaccuracies vs. process description.

- **Weaknesses/Differences (significant deductions for strictness; ~1.5 total point loss)**:
  - **Formatting/structure (-0.5)**: Uses ### headings, intro sentence ("Based on..."), bullets under numbered decisions, bullet doc list. GT uses #### headings, inline *conditions*, numbered doc list, "complete list" label, extra note "*(No credit bureau...)*".
  - **Verbosity/additions in decisions (-0.5)**: Adds step numbers (e.g., "after step 4b", "step 6/7/8/9"), full underwriter names repeatedly, explicit next steps ("continue to NFC", "proceeds to Disburse Funds", "if approved... else ends"). GT is concise (e.g., "branch after Dual Underwriter Split", no steps, no explicit flows beyond core branch).
  - **Positioning nuance (-0.3)**: #2 omits GT's explicit "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (uses "step 7" instead).
  - **Doc phrasing (-0.2)**: Minor but strict diffs vs. GT: "≤ 3 months old" (GT: "≤ 3 months"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (GT: "pay-stub/tax slip"); "(CIS) template" (GT: "(CIS)"). Matches prompt but deviates from GT.
  - Lacks GT's extra clarifying note.

Semantic content is highly faithful (no factual errors), but strict rubric penalizes all presentation/phrasing diffs and additions as deviations from GT's concise style.
