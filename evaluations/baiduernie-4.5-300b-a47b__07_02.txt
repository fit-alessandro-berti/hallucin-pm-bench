6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (strong match, 9/10)**: Correctly identifies all three new tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject). Minor deduction for using only IDs without names (e.g., "Verify Identity") as in ground truth, which reduces clarity and fidelity to the BPMN naming convention.
- **Removed tasks (strong match, 9/10)**: Correctly identifies Task_RejectLoan. Minor deduction for omitting the task name ("Reject Loan") as specified in ground truth.
- **Gateway-type changes (poor match, 3/10)**: Correctly notes the core change (Exclusive to Inclusive), but incorrectly includes ignored cosmetic renamings (gateway name "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check" and flow condition labels "yes"/"no" to "eligible"/"missing docs"/"ineligible"). The prompt explicitly instructs to ignore renamings, and these do not qualify as "gateway-type changes" (e.g., no structural shift like XOR to OR beyond the type). This violates the strict headings and introduces extraneous content, significantly deviating from the ground truth's singular, precise focus. No mention of "exclusive (XOR)" vs. "inclusive (OR)" terminology or the explicit note of no other changes.
- **Overall structure and adherence (6/10)**: Uses the exact headings and groups changes appropriately, but the inclusion of non-relevant details under "Gateway-type changes" undermines the "strictly" summarized requirement. Ignores no other elements (e.g., flow additions are implied in tasks/gateway but not listed separately, correctly). Ground truth's numbered format, bolding, and parenthetical IDs enhance precision, which LLM lacks. Total weighted score reflects strict evaluation: core facts are present but polluted by errors, leading to notable differences.
