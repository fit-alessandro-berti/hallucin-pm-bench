9.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the required one-pair-per-line format without extraneous content. However, under utmost strictness, it loses 0.5 points for minor spacing inconsistencies in the second pair compared to the ground truth (fewer leading spaces before the em dash, disrupting exact alignment). No other errors or omissions.
