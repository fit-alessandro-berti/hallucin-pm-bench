9.0

The LLM answer proposes the identical core improvement (changing `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" on the "Task_CollectEquipment" element), fully complying with the task rules without adding/deleting elements or reversing flows. The unified diff is correctly formatted as a single hunk, though it includes minor extras like file paths and approximate line numbering not present in the ground truth. The one-sentence rationale is logically sound and enhances SLA compliance but is less precise than the ground truth's (omitting specific day counts, the 3-day SLA target, and explicit no-new-activities clause), warranting a small deduction under strict evaluation; however, the functional match is near-perfect.
