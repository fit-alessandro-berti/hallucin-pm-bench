9.5

The LLM answer is almost perfect:  
- The unified diff is exactly as in the ground truth, correctly changes the `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" for the `<bpmn:userTask id="Task_CollectEquipment">` element, and does so as the only modification (no extra context or hunks).  
- The rationale sentence is correct, concise, and matches the essence of the ground truth (mentions overall process duration/SLA compliance).

**Minor issue:** The rationale doesn’t specify that the change "keeps the overall onboarding cycle inside the contractual 3-day SLA," which is in the ground truth—this is a slightly less precise justification, omitting the explicit link to the contractual 3-day SLA boundary.

**Penalty for minor omission:** -0.5

**Final grade:** 9.5
