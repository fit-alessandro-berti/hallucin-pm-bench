**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: Core content is **perfectly accurate**. Identifies **exactly** the same changes: 3 added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), 1 removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and 1 gateway-type change (Gateway_Decision: exclusive → inclusive). No hallucinations, ignores renamings/cosmetics correctly (e.g., task/gateway names, flows). Order of listed items matches ground truth.
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Extra verbosity/details (-0.8)**: Adds unrequested "Details" and "Impact" columns/explanations (e.g., insertion points, conditions, behavioral impacts like "one or more paths may fire"). Ground truth is purely minimal summary; these are interpretive expansions beyond "summarise *all* changes".
  - **Format deviations (-0.6)**: Tables vs. ground truth's simple numbered/bulleted lists with "**Name** (`ID`)". Extra "## Change Summary" intro. Capitalization ("Added Tasks" vs. "Added tasks"). More precise (XML tags like `exclusiveGateway`) but not matching.
  - **Phrasing nuance (-0.4)**: In added tasks, "Replaces the former `Task_RejectLoan`" for Task_FinalReject implies linkage/replacement (accurate functionally but blurs strict add/remove separation; ground truth treats independently without crossover mention).
- **Overall**: Near-excellent (content fidelity ~100%), but strict rubric penalizes all differences (format, extras) heavily as "small errors". No major factual errors, so not below 8.
