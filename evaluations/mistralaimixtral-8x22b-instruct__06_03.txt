The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, matching the ground truth's core content perfectly. No factual errors or omissions. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: added introductory sentence (not in GT), invented sub-labels "Tasks 3a/3b" (unnecessary and absent in GT/prompt), different phrasing ("Parallel Split" vs. "parallel block"), bullet formatting vs. inline `task` ‖ `task`, and slightly rephrased conclusion. Under utmost strictness, these superficial variances warrant a small but significant deduction from perfection.
