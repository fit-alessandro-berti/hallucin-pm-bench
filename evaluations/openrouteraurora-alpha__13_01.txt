**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth across all questions under utmost strictness:

- **Q1**: Exact match (`1` occurrence/time).
- **Q2**: Exact match (`5.56 %`, with correct calculation shown).
- **Q3**: Exact match (identifies **A1002** as the sole case; phrasing is equivalent for "list the case identifier(s)").
- **Q4**: Exact match (provides any two valid reasons—**small sample size** and **temporal bias**—stated clearly with precise derivations from the log: 18 events, 4 cases, single day 2025-05-01; no hallucinations or extras beyond the listed options).

No differences, errors, inferences, or deviations; fully adheres to the system prompt's constraints.
