### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiencies, ~60% of Score Weight)**: The ground truth identifies three distinct decision points, including implicit ones inferred from activity names and constraints (e.g., eligibility validation implying rejection, and approval steps implying failure paths). The LLM answer severely under-identifies by listing only one (the explicit high-value threshold), explicitly denying others exist despite the prompt requiring summarization of *every* decision point. This omission of two key points (eligibility check and final approval/rejection) is a critical failure in completeness and fidelity to the ground truth, warranting a heavy deduction (equivalent to ~4 points lost). Minor positives: Correctly describes the one identified point and avoids introducing undefined elements.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Match, ~40% of Score Weight)**: The lists are nearly identical in content, order, and details (e.g., both note AuditTrail's conditional use and include all seven items without extras). Slight phrasing differences (e.g., LLM uses bullets vs. ground truth's numbering; LLM adds a review note for AuditTrail) are negligible but still minor deviations under strict criteria, deducting ~0.5 points.

- **Overall Structure and Adherence**: LLM follows the prompt by summarizing decisions and listing documents without introducing undefined activities/artefacts, and notes the absence of legacy elements (matching ground truth). However, the incomplete decision coverage dominates, making the response substantially divergent. Strictness applied: Even implicit alignment issues (e.g., not tabling decisions like ground truth) contribute to loss, but no egregious additions inflate the score. Total reflects ~35% alignment to ground truth.
