4.0

- The LLM answer shows clear effort to map activities to the authorized vocabulary, and all four mandated terms appear exactly as required.
- However, there are SEVERAL strong deviations from the ground truth.

**Major issues:**
1. **Extra Activities**: The LLM introduces activities not present in the ground truth ("Approval", "Schedule Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst") instead of the required "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds".
2. **Incorrect RACI Assignments**:
     - Intake Vetting: Fails to mark Compliance Analyst as Consulted (C).
     - KYC Review, AML Screening: Treasury Ops is not marked as Informed (I), missing C for Compliance Officer.
     - Risk Scoring: Only "R, A" for Compliance Analyst, missing split (R for Compliance Analyst, A for Compliance Officer), and misses C for Front-Office Analyst / I for Treasury Ops.
     - Compliance Officer Approval (missing as activity): Instead, has a generic "Approval" row not correctly mapped.
     - Release Funds: LLM adds rows for "Scheduling Payment", "Release Funds", "Notify Originating Analyst", which are not ground truth.
     - Generally, Informed and Consulted are underused across almost every row.
3. **Formatting**:
    - The LLM answer misses the ground truth’s dash (–) for “no involvement”.
    - Uses "R, A" for Treasury Ops in "Notify Originating Analyst", but this is not in ground truth; also, not all activities are the same as in the ground truth.

**Minor issues:**
- LLM briefly mentions synonyms in the initial methodology (e.g., "Preliminary Assessment" → "Intake Vetting", etc.), but not in the output table. Still compliant.
- The introduction/legend is fine, but not exactly as per ground truth, though this is minor.

**Summary:**  
- There are **substantial errors in both activity definition and RACI assignments**.
- Authorized vocabulary is respected, but the mapping and coverage diverges strongly from ground truth.
- For strict grading, significant deductions for each missed RACI relationship and each superfluous/absent activity.

**Score: 4.0** (Some value for correct use of vocabulary and general intent to fulfill requirements, but strong deductions for both coverage and RACI assignment accuracy.)
