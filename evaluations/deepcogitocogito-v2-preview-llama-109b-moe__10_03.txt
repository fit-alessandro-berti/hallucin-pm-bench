2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth (GT) and prompt requirements, warranting a very low score under strict criteria. Key failures include:

- **Extra content and structure violations**: The output begins with lengthy explanatory text (e.g., analysis, mappings, per-activity breakdowns), including forbidden vocabulary like "Preliminary Assessment", "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)", "Sanctions Check", and "risk rating". The prompt mandates *only* the Markdown table as output, using *authorized vocabulary exclusively*. This alone is a major breach, as even explanations must adhere to the strict policy. The table also includes an unrequested title (# RACI Matrix...) and legend, altering the format.

- **Added, renamed, and merged activities**: The prompt specifies covering *every activity described* without renaming, merging, or adding. The process narrative implies core activities (mapped to the four authorized terms) plus escalation approval and fund release. GT limits to five activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring, Compliance Officer Approval, Release Funds). The LLM adds unauthorized activities (e.g., "Approval (when score >70)", "Schedule Payment (when score ≤70)", "Notify Originating Analyst") and splits "Releasing funds" while omitting or misnaming others (e.g., no distinct "Compliance Officer Approval"). It also injects conditional phrasing (e.g., "when score >70") not in GT or narrative. This inflates the matrix to 8 rows vs. GT's 6, fundamentally mismatching scope.

- **Inaccurate RACI assignments**: Nearly all entries differ from GT, ignoring implied consultations/informations across roles (e.g., no "C" anywhere in LLM, despite GT's extensive Cs for Compliance Officer/Analyst). Examples:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM has R,A only for Front-Office Analyst and I for Treasury Ops (inconsistent with its own explanation of "None"). GT: R,A for Front-Office, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury, – for Officer.
  - **KYC Review/AML Screening**: LLM: R,A only for Compliance Analyst. GT: R,A for Analyst, C for Officer, I for Treasury.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM: R,A for Analyst. GT: C for Front-Office, R for Analyst, A for Officer, I for Treasury.
  - **Approval/Release Funds**: LLM's versions have sparse/incomplete assignments (e.g., Approval: only R,A for Officer, blanks elsewhere; Release: only R,A for Treasury). GT: Detailed Is/Cs across roles (e.g., Approval: I for Front-Office, C for Analyst, R,A for Officer; Release: I for Front-Office, Cs for Analyst/Officer, R,A for Treasury).
  Inconsistencies within LLM (e.g., table I for Treasury on Intake Vetting vs. explanation "None") compound errors.

- **Formatting and detail errors**: No bolding on R,A as in GT (e.g., **R, A**). Empties are blank vs. GT's "–". No footer/key points matching GT's style. Minor but per strictness: Vocabulary is correct *in the table* but violated elsewhere; however, the policy is absolute ("STRICT", "nowhere else").

These issues (vocabulary leaks, added elements, structural extras, assignment mismatches) represent wholesale non-compliance, far exceeding "small errors." Partial credit for using the four authorized terms in the table and basic Markdown structure prevents a 1.0, but the output fails as a faithful RACI matrix.
