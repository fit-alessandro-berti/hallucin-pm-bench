The LLM answer exactly matches the required content and structure of the ground truth: the correct two pairs only, properly alphabetized both within pairs (Create_Documentation before Quality_Check; Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines) and across the list (C-pair before P-pair), one per line, using the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y` with consistent spacing as exemplified in the prompt. No extraneous pairs, no reference to Process A, no other errors. Minor whitespace alignment in the ground truth appears stylistic (for monospaced rendering) and not mandated by the prompt, so no deduction under strict evaluation.
