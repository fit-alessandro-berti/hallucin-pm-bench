### Score: 1.5

The LLM answer adheres strictly to the vocabulary policy (using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" correctly without any forbidden terms), and the table structure is mostly appropriate with no extra tasks or roles introduced. However, the RACI allocations deviate significantly from the ground truth in at least four activities (Receive Application, KYC Review, Payment Clearance, Record Update), including incorrect assignments for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed roles (e.g., Compliance Officer as I instead of C for Receive Application; Account Manager as C instead of A for KYC Review; multiple instances of R/A where only R or A is specified in ground truth). Each activity must have exactly one Responsible per the rubric, but the LLM's variations (e.g., adding unwarranted A to R in several cases) violate the narrative reflection. Minor formatting issues (e.g., added legend, abbreviations in headers not in ground truth) compound the errors, warranting near-minimal scoring under strict evaluation.
