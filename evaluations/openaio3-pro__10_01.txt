7.0

**Assessment breakdown:**

**Vocabulary policy compliance:**  
- The answer uses the required terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without using any forbidden terms.  
**No deduction here.**

**RACI allocations — Strictness on Mistakes:**  
On careful row-by-row comparison with the ground truth:

1. **Receive Application**
   - LLM: AM—R/A, CO—I, FC—I, IT—I
   - Ground Truth: AM—R/A, CO—C, FC—I, IT—I
   - **Mistake:** LLM fails to mark CO as "C" (Consulted); replaces it with "I" (Informed). **Significant error.**

2. **KYC Review**
   - LLM: AM—C, CO—R/A, FC—I, IT—I
   - Ground Truth: AM—A, CO—R, FC—C, IT—I
   - **Mistakes:** 
     - AM: Should be A (Accountable), LLM lists as C (Consulted). 
     - CO: Should be R (Responsible), LLM has R/A. 
     - FC: Should be C, but marked as I.
   - **Multiple substantial mistakes**.

3. **Order Vetting**
   - Both: AM—R/A, CO—C, FC—I, IT—I
   - **Correct.**

4. **Payment Clearance**
   - LLM: AM—C, CO—I, FC—R/A, IT—I
   - Ground Truth: AM—A, CO—C, FC—R, IT—I
   - **Mistakes:**
     - AM: Should be A, LLM marks as C.
     - CO: Should be C, LLM marks as I.
     - FC: Should be R, LLM has R/A (not critical if R&A is fine, but not ideal).
   - **Important misassignments.**

5. **Record Update**
   - LLM: AM—I, CO—I, FC—I, IT—R/A
   - Ground Truth: AM—C, CO—I, FC—C, IT—R
   - **Mistakes:**
     - AM: Should be C, LLM has I.
     - FC: Should be C, LLM has I.
     - IT: LLM says R/A (slight deviation; should be R).
   - **Significant errors.**

6. **Notify Customer**
   - Both: AM—R/A, CO—I, FC—I, IT—I
   - **Correct.**

**Formatting:**  
- The output formatting is clean and clear, with header and RACI notation explained.  
- The use of vertical bars is acceptable (markdown alignment isn't required), though ground truth is a markdown table. **No deduction for format.**

**No extra/unwarranted content.**

**Summary:**  
- The main strictness driver: *multiple roles have the wrong RACI assignments for several activities (notably KYC Review and Payment Clearance)*.
- Not all rows are wrong, and terminology compliance is correct.
- The answer follows instructions but makes enough errors to warrant a heavy penalty.

**Deduction rationale:**  
- Each row with a mistake should result in a full point off.
- Out of 6 rows, only 2 are fully correct.
- Some rows have multiple errors, indicating a lack of diligence in role allocation.

**Final score: 7.0/10** (Significant loss of points for missing correct role designations, but vocabulary is strictly correct and structure is otherwise compliant.)
