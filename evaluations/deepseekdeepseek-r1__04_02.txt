5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification similar and concise (under 20 words), minor phrasing difference (no significant loss). Score contribution: Full.
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated). Justification entirely wrongâ€”ignores Change_Request triggering new approval as "last required," leading to Ship_Goods (03-05) being before final approval (03-07) and outside 2-day window. Critical error in rule interpretation. Score contribution: Minimal.
- **R3**: Status correct (Violated). Justification accurate and concise, matching dates. Score contribution: Full.
- **R4**: Status correct (Not Applicable). Justification equivalent (hazardous=false). Score contribution: Full.
- **R5**: Status correct (Violated). Justification partially accurate (notes Ship_Goods without new approval), but omits Pay_Invoice occurring before new approval, missing a key violation detail. Minor incompleteness, but under 20 words. Score contribution: Partial.
- **R6**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification accurate and concise. Score contribution: Full.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but misses one violation (R2), understating non-compliance scope. Format followed, but analytical depth flawed.

Total: Major deduction for R2 error (wrong status + justification) as it shows misunderstanding of rule interdependencies; small deductions elsewhere. Strict scoring reflects incomplete compliance analysis despite correct outcome.
