7.0

**Justification**:

- R1: Correct (Compliant), concise justification.
- R2: Incorrect. LLM says "Compliant" but should be "Violated": Ship_Goods happened BEFORE the new (second) Manager_Approval, and thus more than 2 days after the last required approval (post-change-request). This is a substantive error.
- R3: Correct (Violated) and correct justification.
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable) and correct justification.
- R5: Correct (Violated) and correct reasoning.
- R6: Correct (Compliant) and concise justification.
- Overall result: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).

**Major error:** R2 rule is critical and the mistake is serious.  
**Minor issues:** LLM justifications are brief but adequate, though occasionally less precise than ground truth.

**Significant deduction for the R2 misclassification. The rest are accurate.**
