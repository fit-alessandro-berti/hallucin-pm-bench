The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in conveying the core reason (absence of time data preventing cycle time calculation), fulfilling the prompt's requirement for a concise explanatory sentence. Minor deductions apply for slight wording variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and less emphasis on "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals"), which introduce negligible but detectable differences under strict evaluation.
