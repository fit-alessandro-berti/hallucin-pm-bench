The LLM answer accurately states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to lack of time-related data (timestamps or durations), matching the core requirement of the ground truth answer. However, it does not explicitly reference that "only event counts" are available, as stated in the ground truth. Although the key reasoning is present, the absence of a mention of "only event counts" is a minor omission, warranting a small but significant deduction given the instructions for utmost strictness and penalizing even small errors.
