7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment) as the ground truth, aligning with table data on high wait times, processing times, rework rates, and SLA breaches. Explanations are mostly table-strict (e.g., citing 150-min wait, 22% rework, 25-min processing, 12.4% SLA), but introduce minor interpretive liberties: (1) an invented ranking metric ("combined negative impact" via rework + SLA sum) not in the prompt or table, violating "based strictly on the table" and risking "guessing" (prompt warns against this; deduct 1.0); (2) unsubstantiated causal claims like wait time "drives massive rework" or variability "inflate[ing] cycle time" (cycle time absent from table; deduct 0.5); (3) "elevated early-stage breaches" for Initial_Assessment downplays that 3.2% is moderate, not standout (deduct 0.3). Recommendations are concrete and data-driven (e.g., targeting <75 min wait, halving to <9 min), comparable to ground truth's focus on cuts/halves, but LLM's are more quantified while ground truth ties to broader impacts (slight style difference; no major deduct). The closing "80% of process rework/breaches" is a hallucinated projection (unverifiable from per-activity %s without weighted totals; deduct 1.0 for factual imprecision). Structure is concise (148 words), professional, and on-task, but header and ranking add unneeded elements vs. ground truth's lean format (deduct 0.3). Overall, strong fidelity (80%+ alignment) but strict penalties for inventions and loose phrasing yield 7.2—good but not exemplary precision.
