6.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision points:**
- The LLM answer identifies both primary decision points correctly and summarizes their rules accurately.
- However, it misses some precision:
  - It does not explicitly specify that “otherwise it proceeds to that review” (Manual-Underwriting-Review) if the risk/amount condition is not met, whereas the ground truth does state this.
  - The rule for the TriVote gate is essentially correct, but the wording is a little off: the LLM says “proceeds to the binding offer stage only if at least two out of three required approvers... provide approval.” That closely matches the ground truth, though not as precisely worded (“at least two of the three approvers... record ‘Approve’”).
- Overall, on the decision points, the LLM demonstrates a clear understanding and covers the conditional logic but with slightly less precision.

**b) Required documents, ordered by appearance:**
- Here, the LLM omits:
  - Scorecard–Cyan
  - Scorecard–Magenta
  - Scorecard–Yellow
  - Signed Offer Sheet 77
- These are clear, significant omissions. The prompt states to list **all** required documents, so missing any, especially four of them (including the key “Scorecards” used at a named process step), is a notable error.
- The documents that are listed are in the correct order for those that are listed.

**Other notes:**
- The LLM did not hallucinate any extraneous documents. It respected the process description in that regard.

**Scoring:**
- Major deduction for missing four required documents in section (b): the three Scorecards and Signed Offer Sheet 77. This is a severe error, as the user is told to be strict.
- Minor deduction for slightly imprecise wording in the decision-point summaries.
- The LLM otherwise displays correct logic and process understanding.

**Overall:** The answer is structured and reflects good knowledge of the process for the two decision points, but the document list error is substantial.

**Final strict score:** 6.0
