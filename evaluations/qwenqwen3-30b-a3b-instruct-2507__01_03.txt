4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part (a) – Decision Points (Score: 7.0/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies both decision points and their core rules with accurate phrasing for the conditions (risk levels, amount threshold, and 2/3 approval requirement). However, it loses points for minor inexactness: (1) the risk decision omits explicit "otherwise proceed to review" (implied but not stated as in ground truth), and (2) the TriVote phrasing uses "provide approval" instead of "record 'Approve'" and adds "proceeds to the binding offer stage only if," which slightly alters the ground truth's neutral "the loan may advance only when." Strict evaluation penalizes these small deviations significantly, as they are not verbatim matches.

- **Part (b) – Documents List (Score: 1.0/10)**: This is severely deficient. The LLM omits the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicitly listed as inputs/documents first appearing in Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check), before the Deck Memo in Step 5. It also fails to distinguish "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate item (required in Step 8, distinct from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" prepared in Step 7). The list is incomplete (5 items vs. ground truth's 9), out of sequence due to omissions, and incorrectly implies ID Matrix Declaration appears without the signed offer. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions), but the core errors make this a major failure in completeness and accuracy.

**Overall Score Justification**: Weighted average (equal parts a/b) yields ~4.0, reflecting strictness for the catastrophic b) errors (omissions of early, explicit documents) outweighing the mostly solid but imperfect a). Even small issues like phrasing are docked, but the document list alone justifies a low total.
