9.0

- The LLM answer provides essentially perfect factual answers to all three questions. The case counting, activity preceding "Ship_Order" in C456, and the only-once activity are all evaluated correctly and presented in an understandable way.
- However, the model includes much more text than requested. The instruction was to give concise, bullet-point answers only. The LLM answer contains verbose process explanations and even duplicates the answer at the end in two formats.
- Strictly, according to the requirements, "Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points." The extra explanations, intermediate steps, and final restatement with additional description (e.g., "3 distinct cases present: C456, C123, and C789") go beyond concise bullet points.
- There are no factual/logic errors in the final answers for any of the questions.

Therefore, a 1-point penalty is given for not being strictly, concisely bullet-pointed; the score is **9.0**.
