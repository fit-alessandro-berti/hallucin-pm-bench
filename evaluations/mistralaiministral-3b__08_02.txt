The LLM answer correctly identifies Q1 as "Yes" but provides a vague, non-explanatory justification lacking the ground truth's path details and markings. For Q2, the proposed sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5 → T3) is invalid: T5 consumes the token in P2, disabling T3 afterward, making post-T5 firing of T3 impossible. The explanation misstates enablement (T5 requires P5, absent until after T4). These errors (invalid sequence, factual inaccuracy, missing markings/proof) significantly deviate from the ground truth's precise, valid demonstration, warranting major deduction despite brevity compliance.
