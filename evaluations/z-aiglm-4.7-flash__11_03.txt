7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst-performing jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times. Accurately quantifies SLA exceedances (Legal +300s, Risk +300s, Credit +60s) and mentions waiting times, all grounded in table data without invention. Uses bullet points *only* for recommendations. Memo structure is executive-style with header, body ~130 words (close to ≈150). No extraneous metrics or activities invented.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences)**:
  - **Header/subject mismatch** (-0.8): "TO: Orion COO / FROM: Senior... / RE: Critical..." vs. ground truth's "*To: COO / From: Process Performance Office / Subject: Throughput Bottlenecks... (April 2025 sample)*" – wrong "From", generic RE, no specific subject/date phrasing.
  - **Opening/body phrasing divergence** (-1.0): LLM's "highlights three activities failing joint... criteria" vs. ground's "highlights three activities that materially breach... largest queues" + invented "4 805 cases" (but LLM avoids invention, still differs in wording/style/bolding).
  - **Quantification style** (-0.5): Inline sentences without bolded "**900 s** vs. 600 s (+300 s)" format; omits explicit "vs. X s SLA" for each (e.g., Credit just "exceeding... by 60s").
  - **Recommendations major mismatch** (-0.5): Bullets present and one-per-activity, but content entirely different (LLM: generic automations with invented targets like "cut... by 180s" – arbitrary, not precisely data-tied; ground: specific heuristics/bypass/add-staff with activity bolding and "**Recommended actions**" header). LLM less elaborate/concrete.
  - **Missing elements** (-0.3): No closing projection ("35% reduction"), no bolding/italics, no "throughput bottlenecks" theme.
  - **Minor formatting/style** (-0.2): * bullets vs. • ; plainer presentation; slight invention in rec targets (e.g., 180s unexplained).
- **Overall**: Core data/identification (40% weight) perfect = +4.0; quantification close = +2.5; recs/structure/wording differ substantially = +0.7. Strict penalty for *any* deviation yields 7.2 (high but not 10 due to multiple small-medium diffs accumulating).
