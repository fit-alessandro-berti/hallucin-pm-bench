8.0

- The LLM answer gives:
    - "3" (should be "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"). The omission of the explicit list and not stating "cases" is a minor loss in precision and clarity.
    - "Pack_Items" (correct).
    - "Cancel_Order" (correct).
- So, two answers are perfectly correct; the first answer is minimally insufficient due to lacking explicit enumeration and full label.
- According to strictness expectations, small errors should incur significant loss; thus, this answer loses 2 points out of 10.
