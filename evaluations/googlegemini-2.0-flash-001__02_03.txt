8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1 (Distinct cases)**: Correct count of "3", but misses the explicit listing of cases (C123, C456, C789) as in ground truth, which adds specificity despite the question only asking for the count. Minor deduction for incomplete alignment (-1.0).
- **Q2 (Preceding activity for C456)**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" vs. "Pack\_Items"; escaping is trivial). No deduction.
- **Q3 (Activity appearing once)**: Exact match ("Cancel_Order"). No deduction.
- **Overall Format/Conciseness**: Prompt requests "concise, bullet-point answers only," but LLM adds unnecessary intro ("Here are the answers..."). Ground truth uses labeled bullets (**A1**, etc.) without introâ€”slight deviation in structure (-0.5). Content is accurate and responsive, but strict criteria penalize any non-exact match to ground truth presentation.
