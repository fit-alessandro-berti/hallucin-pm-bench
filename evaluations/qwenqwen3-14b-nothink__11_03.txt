8.0

The LLM answer largely identifies the correct three worst-performing activities (**Legal Approval**, **Risk Review**, **Credit Assessment**), quantifies SLA breaches and waiting times accurately according to the data, and provides clear, bullet-pointed recommendations as required. However, several errors and omissions warrant significant deductions:

- The memo omits the total scope of cases analyzed ("4 805 completed cases"), reducing evidentiary grounding.
- It does not quantify the end-to-end impact of the recommendations (e.g., “reduce cycle time by 35%”), missing a key insight from ground truth.
- Recommendations are generic (“streamline,” “implement automation,” “retrain staff”), lacking specific, data-driven or process-grounded references supported by the table (e.g., “rule-based pre-checks,” “add one risk analyst in the morning,” “deploy straight-through for loans under €25k”).
- The memo lacks the formal header components (recipient, sender, subject), as shown in the ground truth.

These issues reflect insufficient data grounding and specificity, justifying a 2-point reduction from a perfect score for strict marking standards.
