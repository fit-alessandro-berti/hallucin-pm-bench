2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary policy (STRICT - 2/10)**: Perfect compliance—all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") used exactly; no forbidden terms. (+2 points baseline).
- **Correctness of RACI allocations (0/6 major points)**:
  - Violates core RACI rule: **Exactly one Responsible (R) per activity** (per rubric and standard RACI). Order Vetting has *two R's* (AM and FC)—major invalidation (-2). Record Update has IT=A (wrong; narrative assigns to IT as Responsible, ground truth **R**; A is not R) (-1).
  - Does not reflect narrative accurately: e.g., Receive Application handled solely by AM (LLM wrongly assigns CO=A, ground truth C); Order Vetting by AM only (LLM wrongly FC=R).
  - AM Accountable inappropriately/missing: No R/A combos where ground truth has **R/A** (Receive, Order Vetting, Notify); partial A elsewhere mismatched.
  - Incomplete: Blanks instead of full RACI (ground truth fills *all* cells with R/A/C/I per role/activity inference from process flow). Every row differs substantially.
- **Formatting & Structure (-1)**: Headers include abbreviations "(AM)" etc. (ground truth plain names); no bolding on R's or activity names; left column padding differs. Unwarranted FC=R in Order Vetting.
- **Unwarranted content (0/2)**: Extra/wrong R for FC in Order Vetting.
- **Overall differences**: 100% cell mismatch vs. ground truth (no row identical); multiple rule violations. Strict rubric demands perfection—small errors (e.g., blanks, wrong letters) cause significant loss; majors (two R's, wrong R/A) catastrophic. Total: 2.0 (vocabulary saves from 1.0).
