**9.2**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable for R1–R6) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are all ≤20 words, accurate, and explain violations correctly (e.g., R3 identical; R2 captures pre-approval timing violation for expedited Ship_Goods; R5 correctly identifies Ship_Goods pre-new approval, sufficient despite omitting Pay_Invoice which ground includes). Minor deductions for: R2 lacking explicit "expedited"/dates/>2-days phrasing (-0.4); R5 omitting Pay_Invoice and "after approvals" (-0.2); format as list vs. ground truth table (-0.2). No factual errors; highly faithful under strict criteria.
