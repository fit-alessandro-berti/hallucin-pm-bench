**Score: 8.5**

**Evaluation:**

1. **Numeric answers (items 1, 2a, 2b):**  
All answers are correct, calculations are precise and rounding is appropriate.

2. **Explanatory answer (item 3):**  
The explanation is concise and accurate: it correctly states that a low-support activity is not representative and can skew results or hide general patterns.  
However, it could be stricter:  
- It lacks mention of *variance/instability* (such as the issue of single observations having high variance or effect on confidence).  
- It does not explicitly *warn against over-generalisation* based on statistics (e.g., confidence intervals, misleading averages, probability collapse if future data has none).  
- The caveat about “noisy” statistical impact is only implied, not spelled out.

**Summary:**  
All numbers and percentages are accurate and well presented. The qualitative explanation is essentially correct, but it does not directly address all requirements (variance/instability, risk of over-generalization based on a single observation). This deducts 1–1.5 points, hence **8.5**.
