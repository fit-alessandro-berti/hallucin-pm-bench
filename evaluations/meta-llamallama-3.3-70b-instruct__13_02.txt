The LLM answer is correct and precise on questions 1 and 2 (full match to ground truth numerics and calculations). However, question 3 is deficient: it vaguely addresses low support and over-generalization (meeting criterion iii partially) but fails to explicitly mention the single-occurrence issue (criterion i) or detail variance/instability risks (criterion ii, e.g., no reference to noise, skewing from one data point, or unreliable estimates). The explanation is generic and superficial, missing the depth required for a strict evaluation, warranting a significant deduction.
