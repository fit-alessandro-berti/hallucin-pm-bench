**Score: 9.5**

**Justification:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks, all removed tasks, and accurately describes the gateway-type change from exclusive to inclusive.
- The name update from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check" is mistakenly labeled as "not cosmetic" (the prompt says to ignore cosmetic renamings), but the answer does not treat it as a structural/process change—just an aside—so the core facts are not affected.
- The gateway-type change is described with sufficient clarity, matching the ground truth.
- No extraneous or missing points.
- However, the brief commentary on gateway name, and stating the name change is "not cosmetic" (when it is), demonstrates the LLM has not adhered strictly enough to the instruction to ignore non-structural changes. This is a minor but noticeable flaw deserving a small deduction.

**Summary:** The core information is perfect, but very minor attention to extraneous detail warrants a slight penalty.
