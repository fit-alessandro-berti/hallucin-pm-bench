7.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer is mostly accurate in identifying the core changes but includes a notable error in the "Gateway-type changes" section by mentioning and justifying the name update ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check") as a "functional" change tied to the gateway type. This directly violates the instruction to ignore cosmetic renamings, introducing extraneous and incorrect analysis under that heading. The ground truth omits any reference to the name, focusing solely on the type change (with precise XOR/OR notation, which the LLM approximates but does not match exactly). 

Minor differences include:
- Formatting: Bullets vs. numbered lists; extra "id:" labels and "from BPMN_v1" phrasing in removed tasks (unnecessary but not harmful).
- Lack of the ground truth's closing note ("No other...") and header structure.

These deviations, combined with the renaming error, warrant a deduction from a perfect score, per the strict evaluation criteria. The added/removed tasks sections are nearly identical in content (9/10 match), but the gateway error pulls the overall score down significantly (5/10 for that section).
