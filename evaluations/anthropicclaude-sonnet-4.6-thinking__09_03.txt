9.5

The LLM answer is nearly identical in substance to the ground truth: both correctly identify the impossibility due to absent data (only headers in Artefact A, no rows/timestamps), specify the need for "Approve Invoice" durations, cover all metrics (average cycle time, std dev/CI or "dispersion"), and adhere to instructions without guessing or fabricating. Minor deductions (-0.5) for slightly greater length/wordiness (not strictly "one short paragraph"), explicit mention of Artefact B (accurate but extraneous to core "why" for log metrics), and phrasing variations (e.g., "sole reason... no data whatsoever" vs. "necessary data are absent"), per utmost strictness on any differences.
