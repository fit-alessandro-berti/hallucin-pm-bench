4.0

- The LLM answer correctly analyzes R1, R3, R4, and R6.
- However, it incorrectly marks R2 and R5 as Compliant instead of Violated. The "last required approval" for expediting (R2) should refer to the new (post-change) Manager_Approval, not the initial Finance_Approval. Ship_Goods happens before this new approval, making R2 Violated.
- For R5, the rule is violated because both Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occur before the post-change Manager_Approval. The LLM answer fails to see this, marking it as Compliant.
- The overall conclusion ("NON-COMPLIANT") is correct, but the justification (only mentioning R3 as violated) is incomplete.
- Formatting and explanation are generally clear, but the critical misjudgments on R2 and R5 are substantial and would impact audit quality.
- Strictness requires that these errors significantly lower the score. Thus, a score of 4.0 is warranted.
