**10.0**

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in verdict ("No"), rule-by-rule assessments (all verdicts match exactly: R1/R2/R4 satisfied, R3 violated), and justification (both pinpoint NA before RA as the sole violation per Rule 3, while affirming other rules). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., LLM's table adds explicit positions and "Requirement" column; slightly longer but still concise explanation) enhance clarity without errors or deviations. Fully compliant with prompt requirements under strict evaluation.
