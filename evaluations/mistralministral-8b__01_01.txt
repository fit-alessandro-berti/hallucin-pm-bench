3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially addresses the prompt but deviates significantly from the ground truth (GT) in accuracy, structure, and fidelity to the process description, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues:

#### Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% Weight)
- **Inaccuracies in Identification**: The GT identifies exactly 3 decision points with precise branching logic (eligibility check, amount threshold, final approval/rejection). The LLM incorrectly frames 5 activities as "decision points," introducing fabricated decisions (e.g., "Determine if the passenger has completed the RefundRequestForm" in step 1, which is not a decision but mere submission; "Execute payment once signed" in step 5, which is execution, not a decision). It misses the GT's "Final payment approval" decision and the rejection outcomes (e.g., "claim rejected/returned" or "process ends without payment").
- **Lack of Branching Logic**: The LLM lists superficial descriptions without the GT's explicit outcomes/branches (e.g., no mention of "Not eligible → reject" or "Approved → proceed; Rejected → end"). This distorts the process flow.
- **Structural Mismatch**: GT uses a table for clear, process-aligned summaries (#1-3). LLM uses a numbered list tied to activities, blending non-decisions into the summary and ignoring the prompt's focus on "every decision point" without extra activities.
- **Introduction of Undefined Elements**: Subtly implies decisions not defined (e.g., "proceed to the review" as a decision point itself), violating the "Do not introduce" rule.

These errors fundamentally misrepresent the process, leading to substantial point deduction (equivalent to ~4-5 points off a perfect score).

#### Required Documents (Minor Strengths, ~40% Weight)
- **Completeness**: Correctly lists all 7 documents from the process description (RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF), matching the GT catalogue.
- **Conditional Note**: Appropriately flags AuditTrail as "if > €1 000," aligning with GT's caveat.
- **Issues**: Structures as per-activity (redundant and not requested), rather than GT's concise, complete list. Omits GT's explicit disclaimer ("No other documents or legacy activities"), missing reinforcement of constraints. No major fabrications, but presentation dilutes clarity.

#### Overall
- **Strictness Applied**: Even "small" issues (e.g., structural mismatches, missing disclaimer) compound with large ones (fabricated decisions, omitted branches), justifying deduction to 3.5. The answer is informative but unreliable for process analysis, far from GT's precision. No engagement with legacy activity note, but no introduction of it either.
