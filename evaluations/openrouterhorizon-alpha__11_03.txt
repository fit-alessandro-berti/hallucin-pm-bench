4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) as the ground truth, based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies the SLA excesses (300s, 300s, 60s respectively). It grounds descriptions in table data (throughput, waiting times, cases) without invention, adhering to prompt constraints. However, significant differences lower the score under strict evaluation:

- **Structure and Formatting (major deduction, -3.0 points)**: Lacks the ground truth's formal header (To/From/Subject), introductory context (e.g., total cases of 4,805), and bolding for emphasis. Starts abruptly with "COO," and uses a "Recommendations:" header before bullets, violating "bullet points only for the recommendations." No closing projection or formal tone, making it less executive-memo-like (≈150 words, but feels incomplete).

- **Content and Order (moderate deduction, -1.5 points)**: Activity order differs (LLM: Risk Review first; GT: Legal Approval first), altering emphasis. Includes case counts in descriptions (e.g., "across 480 cases"), which GT omits for brevity, introducing minor extraneous detail not in GT.

- **Recommendations (major deduction, -1.0 points)**: Provides one concrete, data-driven action per activity, tied to waiting times/SLA gaps, but they are generic (e.g., "prioritize queue management") compared to GT's specific, inventive ones (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"). LLM avoids ungrounded inventions (aligning with prompt), but this creates substantive divergence from GT's elaborated, projected-impact actions. No end-to-end cycle time reduction mention.

Overall, core analysis matches (~70% alignment), but structural/formatting gaps and less polished recommendations reflect notable deviations, warranting a mid-low score despite no factual errors.
