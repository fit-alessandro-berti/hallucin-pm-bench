7.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities based on both SLA breaches and high waiting times: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.
- The quantitative assessment of SLA breaches is accurate in all three cases (+300s, +300s, +60s), as are the waiting times and case counts.
- Recommendations are brief, actionable, and data-driven, but are notably more generic and less concrete than those in the ground truth. The ground truth recommends specific operational changes (rule-based pre-checks, adding staffing, automating score retrieval, using a straight-through process), while the LLM answer suggests general actions (queue management, reallocation, pre-triage/smooth inflow) without specifying mechanisms or technologies.
- The LLM does not include a header/subject—though this is minor, it does reduce fidelity.
- The LLM's recommendations reference closing/removing the SLA gap directly in the actionable bullet, which stretches the requirement for data-driven specificity but does root the recommendation in the problem; however, “targeting a 300s reduction” is not clearly justified by the data or explained.
- Small but noticeable stylistic differences: the ground truth highlights the impact (“reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35 % and restore SLA compliance throughout the chain”), which is absent from the LLM’s draft.
- The LLM's language (“prioritize queue management”, “reallocate capacity”, “smooth inflow or pre-triage”) is not as directly grounded in the data as the prescribed process changes given in the ground truth.

Due to the lack of concrete, process-level recommendations and some lack of explicit grounding for change mechanisms in the provided data, the response loses significant points, but all answers and figures are accurate and strictly within the data, so it remains above average.
