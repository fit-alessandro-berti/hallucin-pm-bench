### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, capturing both decision points (a) and all documents (b) without omissions, additions, or hallucinations (e.g., no improper mention of KYC/AML). However, under utmost strictness:

- **Part (a)**: Both decision points are correctly identified and summarized in one sentence each, with rules matching the process description. Minor deductions for phrasing differences: (1) "Any two" vs. ground truth's "at least two" (subtle but not identical; "any two" could imply exactly two in isolated reading, though contextually correct); (2) Lack of emphasis on the conditional "only when" or quoted "Approve" phrasing; (3) Descriptive titles ("Conditional branch" and "Gate") vs. ground truth's bolder, process-referential titles (e.g., "**Risk-based skip**"); (4) Currency formatting ("€250,000" with comma vs. "€250 000" with space, matching prompt exactly). These small variances reduce from a perfect 10.0 by 0.5 points total.

- **Part (b)**: Exact match in list content, order, and numbering (9 items, including separating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct first appearance). Minor deduction (0.0 impact here, but bundled) for title wording ("Documents in order of first appearance" vs. "Required documents (first-appearance order)"), which is semantically identical but not verbatim.

Overall, the response is complete, concise, and faithful, warranting a near-perfect score despite nitpicks.
