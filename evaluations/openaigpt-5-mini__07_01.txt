9.0

The LLM answer captures all changes accurately, using the exact element names from the XML as requested. It groups them correctly, does not speculate, and lists only factual differences. The format is slightly off compared to the ground truth: specifically, the LLM lists the XML elements directly (with full tag lines), whereas the ground truth uses a more concise bullet-pointed summary format with both name and id for tasks, and a clear, prose explanation of the gateway change. The LLM’s answer does not show both the id and name for tasks in the summary, nor does it paraphrase the gateway change as explicitly as the ground truth (instead, it uses a notation of “A -> B”).

These minor presentation/formatting deviations, with a lack of full names/ids in prose, should result in a notable deduction since the prompt requests use of “element names exactly as they appear in the XML” but does not suggest dumping the tags themselves. Thus, a 9.0 is reasonable: the substantive content is perfect, but the format is not as strict as would be required by the ground truth.
