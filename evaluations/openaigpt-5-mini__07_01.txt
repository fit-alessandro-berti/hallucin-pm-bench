6.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: exclusive to inclusive for gw_valid), aligning with the ground truth content. However, it deviates significantly in format and presentation, which warrants a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria: 

- Headings use bullet points (â€¢) instead of bolded headers (**Added tasks**, etc.), mismatching the ground truth structure.
- Listed items use raw XML tags verbatim (e.g., full <task> elements with extra whitespace), rather than the ground truth's concise, descriptive format (e.g., * Name (id = `id`)* with bullets).
- Gateway change is shown as a direct XML comparison with "->" arrow and redundant name attribute, instead of the ground truth's succinct "changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)" phrasing.
- No inclusion of the ground truth's closing note on no other differences, though this is minor.

These formatting inconsistencies, even if arguably more literal to the prompt's "exact element names" instruction, represent small but pervasive errors that accumulate to prevent a higher score.
