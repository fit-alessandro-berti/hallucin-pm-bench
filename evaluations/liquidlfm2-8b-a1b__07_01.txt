2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth and the prompt's strict instructions, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Key failures include:

- **Structural non-compliance (major deduction: -3.0)**: The response does not group content under the exact required headings ("• Added tasks", "• Removed tasks", "• Gateway type changes"). Instead, it uses inconsistent formatting (e.g., starting with "• Gateway type changes:", bolded subheadings saying "None", and a second "• Added tasks" section). This violates the "exact headings" rule and creates confusion.

- **Added tasks inaccuracies (major deduction: -2.5)**: Misses the added `check_vip` task entirely (only lists `generate_qr`). Incorrectly states "None" in one section before partially listing one item later. Includes speculative non-factual content ("`send_rma_label` has been replaced with `generate_qr` and redirected to end" and "`reject_return` task now redirects directly to end via *inclusiveGateway*"), which is not allowed ("Do **not** speculate"). Ground truth lists two tasks with name and ID format; LLM uses a mix but omits one.

- **Removed tasks omission (major deduction: -2.0)**: Falsely states "None," ignoring the clear removal of `send_rma_label`. This is a complete category failure.

- **Gateway type changes partial accuracy (minor credit: +0.5, but deduction for phrasing: -0.5)**: Correctly identifies the change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`, aligning with ground truth. However, phrasing adds unnecessary details ("The exclusive gateway `gw_valid` (ID: `gw_valid`) was changed from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`") and redundantly repeats the ID, deviating from the concise ground truth format. No "(none)" for empty categories is mishandled structurally.

- **Overall violations (additional deduction: -0.5)**: Introduces flow/redirect speculations outside the specified categories, ignoring "list **only** the factual differences" and "No other differences should be reported." No mention of "(none)" where applicable (though irrelevant due to errors). Small errors like inconsistent bulleting and extra italics amplify strict loss.

Base score starts at 10.0; total deductions leave ~2.5 for partial gateway correctness, reflecting severe incompleteness and rule-breaking.
