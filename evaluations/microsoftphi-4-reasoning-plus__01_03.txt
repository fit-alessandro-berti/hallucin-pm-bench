3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM identifies three decision points, incorrectly splitting the risk assessment and conditional skip (Steps 3-4) into separate items, while the ground truth combines them into one precise decision point focused on the skip rule. The TriVote description is mostly accurate but adds unnecessary phrasing (e.g., "majority vote" vs. ground truth's "record 'Approve'"), and the overall structure deviates, leading to a partial match (about 60% alignment). This is a significant structural and interpretive error under strict criteria.
- **Part (b)**: Major omissionsâ€”the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) are explicitly listed as inputs/documents in the ground truth but entirely absent here, despite appearing in Step 3. The LLM fails to distinguish "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate required item in Step 8, lumping it with the unsigned version. Deck Memo is included correctly (conditional or not, it's required "anywhere"), but the list is incomplete and out of precise order due to misses. Added explanatory parentheticals inflate the response beyond a simple list, further deviating. Overall, only ~50% match, with critical gaps.
- **General**: No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions), and the response is well-organized but verbose with extra framing text. However, strictness demands heavy penalties for omissions and structural mismatches, preventing a higher score.
