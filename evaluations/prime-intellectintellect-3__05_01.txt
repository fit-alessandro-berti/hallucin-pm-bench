**1.0**

The LLM answer differs substantially from the ground truth in every key aspect: wrong attachment point (`Task_Triage` vs `Task_Receive`), non-interrupting vs interrupting, escalation throw vs direct sequence flow to `Task_Triage`, no new flow or ID (`Timer_48h`), no XML (`<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`), incorrect timing logic ("from process start" on boundary event which activates at task start), and different outcome (escalate without reaching Triage vs bypass to ensure reaching Triage). Mechanism fails SLA enforcement similarly flawed but unrelated to GT. Exceeds strict similarity criteria.
