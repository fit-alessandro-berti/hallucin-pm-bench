8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Perfect match in content (3 cases, listed correctly). Format is close but uses numbering instead of pure bullets; no deduction for this alone, as it's minor and the answer is concise.
- **Question 2**: Core answer ("Pack_Items") is exactly correct. However, the added timeline explanation violates the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction, introducing unnecessary details that inflate the response beyond the ground truth's minimalism. This is a small but clear format/content deviation, warranting a notable deduction under strict criteria.
- **Question 3**: Core answer ("Cancel_Order") is exactly correct. Similarly, the added explanatory parenthetical violates conciseness, mirroring the issue in Q2.
- **Overall**: All factual answers are accurate with no errors in analysis (e.g., correct identification of sequences and uniqueness based on timestamps/cases). Deduction primarily for lack of strict adherence to "concise, bullet-point only" (extra ~50 words of explanation and minor structural differences like "# Answers" header and bolding). Under utmost strictness, this results in a high but not perfect score, as small instructional violations are penalized significantly.
