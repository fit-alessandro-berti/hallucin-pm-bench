2.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No"), accurately flags the violation of Rule 3 (premature NA), and correctly assesses Rule 4 as satisfied. However, it severely misanalyzes the trace sequence, incorrectly claiming violations of Rules 1 and 2 based on factual errors (e.g., wrongly stating NA "interrupts" QE-RA order for Rule 1, despite QE preceding RA; erroneously claiming VP occurs before RA, when the trace shows VP after RA). These are major deviations from the ground truth, which properly identifies only Rule 3 as violated while confirming Rules 1, 2, and 4 as satisfied. The "Key issues" summary compounds these inaccuracies, undermining the entire justification. Under strict evaluation, such substantive errors in rule-by-rule reasoning warrant a low score despite the partial overlap.
