The LLM answer correctly answers "No," aligning with the ground truth that the FACT is inaccurate. However, the justification is flawed and incomplete under strict evaluation: it omits any explicit analysis of Case C002 (a clear violation where Pack_Items intervenes between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment), incorrectly misstates the sequence for Case C001 by claiming Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment (when it actually follows Validate_Payment immediately), and fails to provide a comprehensive case-by-case breakdown like the ground truth's table. While it correctly identifies the violation in C004 and notes C003 as supporting the rule, the factual error in C001 and omission of C002 represent significant inaccuracies, warranting a substantial deduction despite the overall correct conclusion.
