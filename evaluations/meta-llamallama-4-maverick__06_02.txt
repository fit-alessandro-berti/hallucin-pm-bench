The LLM answer is highly accurate in content and enumeration. It correctly identifies and lists all sets of tasks from Process B that can execute concurrently, and provides the result in the required format (numbered lines, tasks comma-separated). However, there is a *very minor* deviation in that the LLM first presents an explanatory discussion and an intermediate summary answer before giving the final enumerated list, and in one of the presented answers, the commas lack spaces, which differs from the formatting in the ground truth.

Strictly following the guidance that "also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," this small formatting discrepancy and the unnecessary initial explanatory content warrant a 1-point deduction. Therefore:
