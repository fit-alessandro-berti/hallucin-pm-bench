The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names matching the ground truth. However, it includes substantial extraneous explanatory text, restates the process description, and provides an intermediate list without spaces after commas, violating the prompt's strict instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" without additional content. This structural deviation warrants a deduction, though the final list itself closely aligns with the ground truth (including spaces after commas).
