3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Under strict evaluation criteria, the LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple ways, warranting a low score. Key issues include:

- **Added and renamed activities (major violation)**: The prompt mandates covering *every activity described* without renaming, merging, or *adding* activities, using only authorized vocabulary for the four core terms. The LLM introduces 5 extraneous activities ("Escalate for Compliance Officer approval", "Compliance Officer approval", "Schedule the payment", "Release the funds", "Notify the originating analyst") not present in the ground truth's streamlined set (which derives directly from the narrative: the four mandated plus "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"). This inflates the table to 9 rows vs. the ground truth's 6, violating the "do not add" rule. "Compliance Officer approval" is split and rephrased from the narrative's "Compliance Officer approval" (matching ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval"), and "Release the funds" partially matches but adds unneeded granularity (e.g., separate "Schedule the payment" and "Notify"). The ground truth omits minor narrative elements like escalation/scheduling/notification to focus on core steps, but the LLM over-expands, introducing errors.

- **Inaccurate RACI assignments (widespread errors)**: Nearly every cell differs, showing poor mapping to the process narrative. Examples:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM marks Compliance Analyst as "I" (correct involvement but wrong; ground truth has "C"). Treasury Ops is blank (should be "I"). Compliance Officer blank (correct as "–").
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office Analyst "C" (should be "–"). Compliance Officer blank (should be "C"). Treasury Ops blank (should be "I").
  - **AML Screening**: Same errors as KYC (Front-Office "–" vs. LLM blank but implied no involvement; Compliance Officer "C" missing; Treasury "I" missing).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Oversimplified to only Compliance Analyst "R, A" (ignores narrative's derivation by Compliance Analyst but with broader accountability). Ground truth correctly distributes: Front-Office "C", Compliance Analyst "R", Compliance Officer "A", Treasury "I".
  - Added rows like "Escalate" and "Schedule" have no ground truth equivalents, so they're invalid inventions with arbitrary RACI (e.g., Compliance Analyst "R, A" for escalation ignores shared escalation logic).
  - "Release the funds": Treasury "R, A" (matches ground truth's "Release Funds"), but others blank (should be Front-Office/Compliance Analyst/Compliance Officer all "I"/"C").

  These mismatches indicate the LLM failed to accurately interpret the narrative's flow (e.g., escalation ties to Risk Scoring >70, involving Compliance Officer accountability; notifications imply "I" roles).

- **Formatting inconsistencies (minor but penalized strictly)**: No bolding for "R, A" (ground truth uses **bold** for emphasis on primary roles). Uses blank cells for no involvement instead of "–" (explicitly noted in key points as the correct marker). No separation or notes matching ground truth's structure. Markdown table is basic but lacks the precise styling.

- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly uses all four authorized terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). Covers all roles. No adult/offensive content issues. However, these basics are outweighed by the structural and content errors.

Overall, the answer captures the core vocabulary (worth ~2 points) and some RACI logic (~1.5 points) but fails on fidelity to activities (~0 points for additions) and precise assignments/formatting (significant deductions). With utmost strictness, small errors (e.g., "I" vs. "C") compound to a major loss, yielding 3.5/10.0. A perfect match would require identical activities, RACI, and formatting.
