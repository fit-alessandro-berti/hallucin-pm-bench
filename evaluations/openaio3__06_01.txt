The LLM answer:

Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check  
Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

is **almost** correct—it lists precisely the two valid pairs, with the tasks in each pair properly alphabetized. However, **the second pair should have extra spaces between the task names ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines")**, as shown in the ground truth. The alphabetical order of the pairs in the overall list is also not quite followed: "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" should come before "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines"—which is achieved in the answer, but with the spacing error on the second pair.

This small but significant formatting mistake (missing internal spaces on the second pair) is a clear deviation from the "utmost strictness" and the example required by the task, warranting the deduction of one full point. No content errors are present.

**Deduction:** Formatting (spaces alignment as in the ground truth) is required; any violation must result in significant loss per instructions.

**Final score:** 9.0
