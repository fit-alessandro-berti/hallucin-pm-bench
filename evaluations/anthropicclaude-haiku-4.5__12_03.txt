The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, structure of reasoning (case-by-case identification of compliant and non-compliant cases), and conclusion. Both correctly answer "No" and justify by citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001â€“C004) with accurate activity sequences, highlighting the two violations that disprove the "always" claim. The only minor difference is presentation (narrative list vs. table), which does not constitute an error or deviation from the task requirements. No deductions for strictness, as there are zero factual, logical, or completeness issues.
