The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides case-based breakdowns, citing the relevant order of activities in each case. It accurately observes that "Update_Inventory" always occurs before "Authorize_Refund" when both appear, and highlights that "Update_Inventory" does not appear at all in Case 1002.

Small deductions:

- The LLM answer spends redundant words explicitly listing each activity in order; while clear, this could be more concise.
- It does not state explicitly that "Authorize_Refund" never immediately precedes "Update_Inventory" (i.e., it never occurs that way in any case), though it strongly implies this.
- The LLM answer could be slightly firmer in stating that the claim is refuted both because the ordering is never correct and because "Update_Inventory" is missing entirely in one caseâ€”thus, the "always" part is fully disproved. The ground truth answer is more explicit here.
- "Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data" is weaker wording than the ground truth's statement that it's simply false.

Otherwise, the LLM answer is accurate, complete, and well-evidenced using the data provided.
