The LLM answer is highly accurate and directly addresses the prompt with a correct "yes", a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, precise full markings at each step, and a brief, correct justification based on concurrent enabling and non-determinism. It has no errors.

Minor differences from ground truth (worthy of small deduction under strictness):
- Lacks the ground truth's extra insight that T5 "must" precede T3 (if it fires) due to inhibitor semantics permanence; instead uses concurrency argument (both valid but different emphasis).
- Sequence is shorter (correctly stops after T5; ground truth extends invalidly to T4, which cannot fire as p3=0 post-T5).
- Slightly more verbose presentation vs. ground truth's compact style.
- Opening phrasing ("it is possible" vs. "can, and indeed must").

Core content matches closely (~90% alignment), no factual errors in LLM (unlike ground truth's invalid T4 step).
