The LLM answer is almost completely correct except for Q5, where it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" as never starting a case (but "Quality_Check" is the first/only event of case C-77) and omits "Validate_Order", which never appears as a first event. Each error is significant given the strictness requested. Thus, a substantial but not maximal deduction applies for this clear factual error: 2 points off for a wrong list in Q5. All other answers are identical to the ground truth.
