7.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, with no deviations. However, Q5 contains a significant factual error: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77) and omits "Validate_Order" (which never starts a case). This misidentifies the activities that never appear as first events, representing a clear misinterpretation of the log. Given the strict evaluation criteria, this error in a key analytical question warrants a substantial deduction from a perfect score, despite the correct handling of the other questions and adherence to the JSON schema.
