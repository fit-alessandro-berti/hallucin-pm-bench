6.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer correctly recognizes two core decision points: eligibility (using manifest and weather) and the high-value threshold (€1,000).
- It lists the relevant documents connected to those steps and excludes legacy activities, as instructed.

**Errors / Omissions:**
- **Misses a Decision Point:** The ground truth rightly splits out a third, critical decision: final payment approval, which is either at Finance_Controller_PreApprove (for non-high-value) or Senior_Auditor_Review (for high-value). The LLM answer does not explicitly mention this, omitting a decision point.
- **Document listing is incomplete:** The LLM answer lists required documents per decision, but does _not_ provide a complete catalogue as requested; it omits *BankTransferAuthorization* and *RefundConfirmationPDF*, both required and clearly required by the prompt and process steps. *EligibilityChecklist* is only associated with Senior Auditor (should also be with Finance Controller).
- **Minor inaccuracies:** The LLM ascribes *RefundRequestForm* consideration to the high-value branch but doesn’t clarify that it’s not an additional document, only source for the refund amount.
- **Branching logic under-explained:** The answer lacks a systematic, explicit mapping of possible outcomes of each decision (e.g., reject/approve, skip/audit), as provided in the ground truth.

**Scoring rationale:**  
- Significant omissions (missing a required decision point and two important documents) merit a substantial deduction.
- The answer is not completely incorrect, but, given the standards for strictness and completeness, a 6.0 is the appropriate score.
