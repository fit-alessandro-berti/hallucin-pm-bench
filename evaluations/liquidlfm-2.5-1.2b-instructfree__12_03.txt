**4.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Correctness of Yes/No (40% weight)**: Correct ("No"). +4.0 points.
- **Justification Accuracy (40% weight)**: Fundamentally flawed. Misinterprets "immediately after... with no other activities in between" as *time-based* (cites 3-min delay in C001, which is actually sequence-compliant per log). Ignores actual violations (C002: Pack_Items intervenes; C004: Check_Fraud intervenes). Fails to analyze all cases (C002, C003 omitted). Invents unsupported details ("multiple transfers between different systems"). 0/4.0 points.
- **Fidelity to Task (10% weight)**: Cites CaseID (C001) but incorrectly; no full sequences or comprehensive evidence. 0/1.0 points.
- **Clarity/Structure (10% weight)**: Brief but unstructured; lacks table or case-by-case rigor matching ground truth. 0/1.0 points.

**Total: 4.0**. Major errors in reasoning and evidence make it misleading despite correct top-level answer; strict deduction for all deviations.
