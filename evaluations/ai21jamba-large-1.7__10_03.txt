The LLM answer violates the strict vocabulary policy by including "(CDD)" after "KYC Review," which is a disallowed term. It also renames, merges, and adds activities (e.g., "Approval (if Risk Scoring >70)," "Payment Scheduling," "Fund Release & Notification") instead of strictly adhering to the described process without alteration. RACI assignments are incomplete and inaccurate, with many roles omitted (e.g., no "I" for Informed across activities, incorrect Consulted/Accountable placements like for Risk Scoring). The table structure differs significantly from the ground truth, including empty cells instead of dashes (â€“) and lacking combined notations like "**R, A**." These multiple, fundamental differences warrant the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
