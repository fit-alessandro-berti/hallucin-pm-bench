The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, numbered in order, with no extraneous information about other processes. This matches the core content of the ground truth precisely. Minor deductions are applied for stylistic differences: lack of descriptive headers (e.g., "Set 1 – first parallel block:"), use of "and" instead of the parallel symbol "‖", absence of code-like backticks, bold formatting, and the concluding sentence confirming no other parallels. These formatting variances, while not altering meaning, represent small but notable deviations under strict evaluation criteria.
