9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks in Process B and presents them in the correct order. However, the answer loses a point for two reasons:

1. The answer omits contextual labels such as "first parallel block" and "second parallel block," which are explicit in the ground truth and clarify which parallel construct each set belongs to.
2. The answer uses simple numbering ("1." and "2.") instead of the more descriptive numbering, which could lead to ambiguity in formal auditing scenarios.

Despite these minor differences, the core content matches the ground truth without any substantive omission or addition. As per the instruction to be extremely strict with even small imperfections, the response is awarded a 9.0.
