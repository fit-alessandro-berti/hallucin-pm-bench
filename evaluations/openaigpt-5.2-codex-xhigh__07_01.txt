7.5

### Explanation
Factual correctness is perfect: correct identification of added tasks (check_vip, generate_qr), removed task (send_rma_label), and gateway change (gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). No extra or missing items, no speculation.

However, with utmost strictness:
- **Headings**: Text matches exactly ("Added tasks" etc.), but GT uses **bold** formatting (LLM plain). Minor deduction.
- **List format**: LLM uses "-" bullets; GT uses "*" with line breaks. Small format error, penalized.
- **Task representation**: LLM uses only `id` values (exact as XML ids); GT uses full `name` attribute + `(id = `id`)`. Significant difference in detail/presentation—LLM omits names, not matching GT structure. Major deduction.
- **Gateway phrasing**: LLM concise ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway"); GT verbose with backticks, bold types, (v1)/(v2). Different wording/structure. Moderate deduction.
- **Other**: No "(none)" needed. LLM omits GT's final note (not required by prompt). No leading "•" bullets on headings (matches GT, not penalized).

Semantically identical (10/10), but textual/format differences reduce to 7.5. Smaller alignment loss if names/ids considered equivalent, but strict per instruction.
