### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth ("1" occurrence). No deduction.
- **Question 2**: Exact match, including calculation and rounding to "5.56 %". No deduction.
- **Question 3**: Near-exact match (phrasing slightly varies but conveys the same: only A1002). No deduction.
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons that align with ground truth options (small sample size/high variance from single observation; lack of representativeness/bias from limited scope, akin to temporal or case-mix bias). No hallucination or unjustified inference in the final response. However, -0.8 deduction for a small but clear error in the preliminary reasoning ("each with only one event per case" – the log shows multiple events per case, e.g., 4-5 per case, totaling 18 events; this misrepresents the data structure, indicating a minor comprehension lapse despite correct final output). Overall strict assessment: responses are highly faithful to the log and ground truth, with only the noted reasoning flaw preventing a perfect score.
