The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to missing timestamps/durations and presence of only event counts, while being concise (one sentence) and precisely tailored to "Dual Authorization" and "minutes" from the prompt. Minor deductions for slight phrasing variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; parenthetical structure vs. em-dashes; "calculation in minutes is possible" vs. "start-to-completion intervals are absent") under utmost strictness for non-verbatim match.
