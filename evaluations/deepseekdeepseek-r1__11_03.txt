7.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) and quantifies SLA breaches accurately.
- It grounds statements in the data: throughput times, SLA overruns, and waiting times.
- No activities or metrics are introduced beyond the table's scope.
- The structure matches the memo requirement, using bullets for recommendations.
- However, there are small but consequential errors:
    - The LLM answer invents percentages (e.g., “80% of throughput time is waiting”), which are not present in the data or ground truth—this violates instruction 2 and introduces extra metrics.
    - The recommendations, while mostly data-driven, are less concrete and specific than those in the ground truth (e.g., “targeting a 50% waiting-time reduction” is less actionable than specifying “add one analyst at peak hours”).
    - The LLM memo's closing line claims to “address root causes quantified in current data” but doesn’t include the projected cycle time impacts as in the ground truth.
    - Small phrasing inaccuracies (calling “Legal Approval” recommendation a “300s processing baseline” with no supporting data).
- These issues, especially inventing new metrics (percentages), merit a significant points deduction.
- Overall, the answer demonstrates good coverage and correct identification, but strict evaluation requires a notable penalty for the fabrication of metrics and vagueness in some recommendations.
