### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Identification of three worst-performing activities (jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting time)**: Correctly identifies the same three (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment), prioritizing high breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). No errors here, but order differs from ground truth (Risk/Legal/Credit vs. Legal/Risk/Credit), a minor structural variance. Full points.
- **Quantification of SLA excesses**: Exact matches for all three (+300s Legal, +300s Risk, +60s Credit), with throughput vs. target clearly stated. Strong alignment.
- **Recommendations**: One concrete action per activity, in bullet points as required—structure complies. Actions are arguably data-driven (e.g., Legal references derived 300s processing time = 900-600), but completely differ from ground truth (e.g., LLM's "parallel processing" vs. GT's "rule-based pre-checks"; LLM's "allocate reviewers targeting 50%" vs. GT's "add one analyst"). Invented specifics like "50% reduction" and "25% lower waiting" violate "do NOT invent...metrics," mirroring but not matching GT's inventions (e.g., GT's "€25k" threshold and "35% reduction" are also invented, yet LLM's % waiting metrics (80%, 67%) add ungrounded derivations not in GT or table). Significant loss for content divergence and inventions.
- **Overall memo structure and constraints**: ~170 words (close to 150). Uses bullets only for recs; grounds most in data but invents % metrics (e.g., "80% of throughput time is waiting"—derived, not supplied). Headers differ (e.g., From: "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. GT's "Process Performance Office"; Subject lacks GT's "Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)"). No absent activities/metrics mentioned. Closing sentence is grounded but doesn't match GT's projection. Minor phrasing variances (e.g., "exceeds SLA by 300s" vs. GT's "+300 s") and inventions deduct points under strictness.
- **Strictness adjustment**: High fidelity in core analysis (activities, SLAs, wait times), but differences in recs, derived % metrics, and header details reflect ~25% deviation from ground truth, warranting deduction from a potential 10.
