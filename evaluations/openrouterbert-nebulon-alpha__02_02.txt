**10.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content across all questions:
- Q1/A1: Correct count (3); extra listing of cases (C001, C002, C003) is accurate and non-fabricated.
- Q2/A2: Identical sequence, including order and separator.
- Q3/A3: Identical distinct activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), one per line, alphabetically ordered.

Stylistic differences (e.g., intro text, bolding, separators, escaped vs. unescaped underscores) are irrelevant to factual precision; no extras, omissions, or hallucinations present.
