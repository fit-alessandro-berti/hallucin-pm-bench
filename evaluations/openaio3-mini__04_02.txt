5.0

### Evaluation Notes:
- **Strengths**: Correct status and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6 statuses match ground truth. Justifications for these are concise (â‰¤20 words) and mostly accurate in substance. Format closely follows the prompt.
- **Major Issues**: R2 status is incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated), with a fully wrong justification that ignores the impact of the Change_Request requiring a new approval (per R5), making the "last required approval" the one on 03-07, not 03-04. This is a critical misunderstanding of rule interactions, warranting significant deduction under strict criteria.
- **Minor Issues**: R5 justification omits Pay_Invoice (focuses only on Ship_Goods), slightly reducing completeness vs. ground truth. R1 justification adds unnecessary "immediately," but doesn't alter correctness. R3 correctly identifies the temporal violation despite trace numbering anomaly.
- **Overall**: One core rule fully mismatched (R2) offsets the rest; strict scoring reflects ~17% error rate in statuses but high impact on compliance analysis.
