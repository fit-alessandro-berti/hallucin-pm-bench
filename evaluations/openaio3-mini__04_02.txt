6.0

Rationale:  
- **R1**: Correct (compliant, with proper justification).
- **R2**: Incorrect. The LLM marks compliant based on Finance_Approval, but per the rule and ground-truth, after a Change_Request a new Manager_Approval resets the "last required approval," so Ship_Goods must have occurred after the *second* Manager_Approval, which is not the case here. This is a critical error and leads to a wrong compliance verdict for this rule.
- **R3**: Correct (violation, proper reasoning).
- **R4**: Correct (not applicable; correct justification).
- **R5**: Correct status (violated), good justification: identifies lack of new approval before further processing.
- **R6**: Correct (compliant, with correct reason).
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).

Summary: The main issue is the incorrect assessment of R2, which is a significant compliance logic error. The rest is mostly accurate, but this single error warrants a substantial deduction given the strict grading required. Other justifications are concise and broadly match the format and intent. The LLM would lose at least 3 points for the misreading of the temporal logic in R2 and possibly 1 point for slight under-specificity in R5's justification.

Therefore: **6.0/10.0**
