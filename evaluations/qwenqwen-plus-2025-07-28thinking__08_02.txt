The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5). The explanation accurately captures the key concurrency via the alternative path (T2-T7-T4 filling P5) while the P2 token remains available for T5, bypassing T3. It stays under 120 words and is factually precise (e.g., P4 from T7 suffices).

Minor deductions (-1.0) for omitting intermediate markings (which ground truth uses to explicitly verify reachability) and not explicitly noting T5's consumption of P2 disables T3 afterward, though implied. No factual errors, but strict evaluation penalizes detail omissions relative to ground truth.
