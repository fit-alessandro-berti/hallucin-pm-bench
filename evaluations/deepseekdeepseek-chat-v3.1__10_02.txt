4.0

**Justification for Score:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer uses the mandated terms: "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", and "KYC Review" (not "CDD").
- Presents the table in Markdown.
- Each step from the informal description is reflected in the RACI table.
- "Compliance Officer" was replaced by "Regulatory Liaison" and "Payment Clerk" by "Transaction Analyst".

**Major Issues (Strictness Applied):**
1. **Missing Operations Manager:**  
   The ground truth answer includes an "Operations Manager" role, **absent** from the provided answerâ€™s table and workflow, despite its clear presence and importance in the RACI structure. This is a major error and alone warrants a severe penalty.
2. **Incorrect "Accountable" Assignment:**  
   In the provided answer, "Accountable (A)" is either omitted or merged with "Responsible (R)" (e.g., "A/R"), especially on steps 3 and 4. The ground truth and best practice assign "A" and "R" to different roles, as per the instructions.
3. **Extra/Mismatched Tasks:**  
   The answer splits some activities (e.g., "release payment" and "send SWIFT message") and adds "archive case file" as its own row, which diverges from how task boundaries are drawn in the ground truth.
4. **Wrong Consulted/Informed Mapping:**  
   Roles such as "Consulted", "Informed" are misapplied or omitted (e.g., "Regulatory Liaison" should be Informed during "Receive Payment Instruction" in the ground truth but is not).
5. **Inconsistent Task Names:**  
   Tasks do not use as strict language as mandated and diverge from the exact expressions in the ground truth ("Receive and log the customer transfer instruction" instead of "Receive Payment Instruction", etc.).

**Other Issues:**
- The LLM answer omits several "Consulted" and "Informed" attributions that appear in the ground truth.
- The "IT Support" is not marked as "Consulted" or "Informed" in several (e.g., in "Release Payment" it should be "C", not just "I" or blank).
- The order and naming of steps are inconsistent with those mandated in the ground truth.

**Conclusion:**  
Due to the major omissions (missing Operations Manager), repeated merging of "R/A" when the ground truth differentiates, recurring minor terminological inconsistencies, and multiple misapplied roles, this answer is significantly below requirements for documentation strictness.  

**Hence, the maximum justified score is 4.0.**
