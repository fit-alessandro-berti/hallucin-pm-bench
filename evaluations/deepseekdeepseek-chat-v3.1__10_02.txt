3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt but exhibits significant deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Role Mismatch (Major Deduction -2.5 points):** The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role present in the ground truth, which serves as the primary Accountable (A) party across tasks. This results in incomplete RACI coverage, as the LLM leaves many accountability gaps (e.g., blank cells for A in tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). The prompt mandates specific terms but does not prohibit additional roles implied by process logic, making the ground truth's inclusion a benchmark for comprehensiveness.

- **Task Formulation and Coverage (Major Deduction -2.0 points):** 
  - The LLM introduces an extra task (#6: "Send the SWIFT message") by splitting the source's combined step 5, leading to 7 tasks instead of the ground truth's 6 streamlined ones. This inflates the matrix without justification.
  - Task phrasings differ notably: e.g., LLM's "#1 Receive and log the customer transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM's "#3 Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" adds unmandated details not in the ground truth. The source's step 6 ("archives the case file; the compliance officer is notified") is handled as "#7 Archive the case file" in LLM, but ground truth uses "Archive Record" with broader Consulted/Informed assignments.
  - While mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", etc.) is used correctly (+1.0 partial credit), small additions like "sanctions lists" (plural vs. source/ground truth singular) and "(if applicable)" introduce minor but penalized inconsistencies.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction -2.5 points):** Assignments diverge substantially, undermining the core purpose of a RACI table:
  - Task 1: LLM assigns only TA as R (blanks elsewhere) vs. ground truth's TA-R, RL-I, Ops-A, IT-C.
  - Task 2: LLM has TA-R, RL-C (blanks) vs. ground truth's TA-R, RL-A, Ops-I, IT-C.
  - Tasks 3-4: LLM uses non-standard "A/R" combined for RL (simplistic and unclear) vs. ground truth's split assignments (e.g., RL-R, Ops-A, with TA-C and IT-I).
  - Task 5 (LLM's release): TA-R, RL-I, IT-C vs. ground truth's TA-R, RL-I, Ops-A, IT-C; plus LLM's extraneous #6 IT-R.
  - Archive: LLM's RL-I, IT-R (TA blank) vs. ground truth's TA-C, RL-I, Ops-A, IT-R.
  These errors indicate a lack of fidelity to the implied process responsibilities in the ground truth.

- **Structure and Clarity (Minor Deduction -0.5 points):** The Markdown table is present and readable, with appropriate use of bold for RACI codes. The intro sentence and notes on RACI meanings are helpful but extraneous (prompt specifies only the table). Ground truth's "Legend" is more concise; LLM's task numbering adds clutter not in ground truth. No omissions of source steps, but reorganization alters mapping.

Overall, while the LLM correctly employs mandated vocabulary and produces a functional table (+2.0 baseline), the pervasive mismatches in roles, tasks, and assignments result in a response that does not accurately reflect the ground truth's structured interpretation of the informal description. Small errors (e.g., phrasing tweaks, combined A/R) compound to significant flaws, justifying the low score. A perfect match would require identical roles, tasks, and assignments.
