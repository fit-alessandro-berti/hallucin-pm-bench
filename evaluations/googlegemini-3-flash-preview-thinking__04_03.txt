### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (full marks):** Both answers correctly conclude **No** due to Rule 3 violation (NA before RA). All rule assessments match: Rules 1, 2, 4 satisfied; Rule 3 violated. Key reasoning identical (e.g., order, timing of VP/NA/CC).
- **Completeness (minor deduction -0.5):** LLM omits explicit "once each" for Rule 1 (ground truth states "QE appears once"), despite rule requiring it. Implicit but not referenced = small error per strict criteria.
- **Justification fidelity (-0.2):** Wording near-identical, but LLM lacks ground truth's explicit "both QE and RA are finished" phrasing and concluding "non-compliant" summary sentence.
- **Format/structure (-0.1):** Bullets vs. table; both "short" per prompt, but table more precise/ground-truth aligned.
- **Strictness adjustment:** 0.3-point buffer retained for near-perfect alignment; no factual errors, just cosmetic/omission diffs warranting minimal deduction.
