The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant and accurately justifies the violation of Rule 2 with relevant event citations, aligning partially with the ground truth. However, it incurs major deductions for incompleteness: it fails to identify the additional violation of Rule 3 (distance of `Three_way_match` exceeding â‰¤2 after `Goods_Received`), omits verification of Rules 1, 4, and 5 (all satisfied per ground truth), and lacks the comprehensive, rule-by-rule structure of the ground truth, resulting in an underdeveloped justification that misses half the violations.
