9.0

- The LLM answer includes both correct pairs and lists them in correct alphabetical order within and across pairs.
- The only deviation is formatting: the ground truth uses two spaces before and after the em dash, and aligns the pairs cleanly, while the LLM answer uses a single space before and after the 'â€”'.
- According to your strict grading, even small formatting errors should result in significant point loss.
- No content error is present, so most points are preserved. However, deduction is warranted for not fully matching the required output format.
- Thus, a score of 9.0.
