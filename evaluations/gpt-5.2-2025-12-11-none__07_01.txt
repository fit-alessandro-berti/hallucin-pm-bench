### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct identifications (full credit)**: Added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway change (`gw_valid`: exclusive → inclusive) match exactly in content and facts.
- **Format/heading deviations (-1.0)**: Used `##` headers instead of `**`bold** (as in ground truth); prompt-specified `•` bullets absent in both but benchmarked against ground truth style.
- **Task listing style (-1.0)**: Quoted full XML elements (verbose, includes tags/spaces like `"check_vip"   name`) vs. ground truth's concise "Name (id = `id`)" format; not "element names exactly" in spirit, adds unnecessary XML noise.
- **Gateway phrasing (-0.5)**: Concise arrow notation good but omits "(v1)" "(v2)" versioning explicit in ground truth.
- **Minor extras/omissions (-0.5)**: No final note "(No other differences should be reported.)"; preserved extraneous XML spaces.
- Overall strict match ~80%: Core facts perfect, but presentation/style mismatches penalize per "utmost strictness" and "small errors significant loss."
