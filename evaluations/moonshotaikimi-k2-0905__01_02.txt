### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~60% weight)**: The LLM identifies only 2 decision points, omitting the critical third one (**Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a distinct voting decision, which is explicitly a decision point in the ground truth). It also fails to contextualize the **Amount Threshold Decision** as occurring "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check," and omits the "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for the **Underwriter Alignment Gate**. Phrasing is close but not exact (e.g., "continue only if" vs. conditional arrows with "⇒"; "the case auto-approves" vs. "system auto-approves"). This incompleteness and lack of precise flow result in a severe deduction.
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors, ~40% weight)**: The list is complete and uses exact terminology, but includes extraneous phrasing (e.g., "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. concise "pay-stub/tax slip"; "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"). Omits the clarifying note "(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)," which emphasizes the non-standard process as per the prompt's intent. These small deviations warrant point loss under strict criteria.
- **Overall**: Strict adherence to the prompt requires exact summarization without omissions or additions. The response is partially accurate but structurally flawed, justifying a low-mid score. No introduction of standard terminology is a positive, but it doesn't offset the gaps.
