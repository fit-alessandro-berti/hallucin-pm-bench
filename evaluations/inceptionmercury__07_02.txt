9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth but has these minor flaws:

- Under "Gateway-type changes": The answer mentions that the gateway's name changed ("The name was also changed from 'Eligible?' to 'Eligibility Check'"), but the prompt explicitly states to ignore "cosmetic renamings". This means the inclusion of this information is a small, but definite, deduction.
- Otherwise, all additions, removals, and the gateway-type change are correctly identified and listed with full fidelity.

Therefore, the answer deserves a 9.0. It missed perfect strictness regarding cosmetic changes.
