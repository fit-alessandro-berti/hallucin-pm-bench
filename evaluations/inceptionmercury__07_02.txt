### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: three added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), one removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive. This matches the ground truth core content without omissions or fabrications regarding additions, removals, or gateway types.

However, under strict evaluation criteria:
- **Inclusion of ignored elements (significant deduction: -1.0)**: The LLM explicitly mentions the gateway name change ("The name was also changed from 'Eligible?' to 'Eligibility Check'"), violating the instruction to "Ignore cosmetic renamings." The ground truth omits this entirely, focusing solely on the type change.
- **Extra descriptive details (moderate deduction: -0.5)**: The LLM adds positional/contextual explanations (e.g., "Added between the start event and reviewing the application" for added tasks, "Removed from the process" for the removed task). These are not required and deviate from the ground truth's minimal, list-based summary. The prompt demands a **strict** summary under headings, without such elaboration.
- **Formatting and precision differences (minor deduction: -0.0, as not heavily weighted)**: The LLM uses bolded task IDs and a bulleted list, while the ground truth uses numbered lists with bolded names and IDs in backticks. It also uses full terms ("Exclusive Gateway") instead of abbreviations ("exclusive (XOR)"), but these are cosmetic and do not alter facts.

No other errors (e.g., missed changes or incorrect identifications). The response is comprehensive yet concise, but the violations of "strictly" and "ignore renamings" prevent a perfect score.
