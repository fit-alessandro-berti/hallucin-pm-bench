The LLM answer is highly accurate and adheres closely to the task: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to missing timestamps and data in the event log (Artefact A), provides a precise, short-paragraph explanation without guessing or external knowledge, and explicitly lists all requested metrics (average cycle time, std dev, 95% CI). It matches the ground truth's core reasoning and structure.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total):
- Does not explicitly reference "Artefact A" or quote the redaction details ("all event rows and every timestamp (start_time / complete_time) have been redacted"), using slightly less verbatim phrasing ("no actual timestamp values or case data—only the column headers").
- Lacks the emphatic "Impossible —" opener and the summary need for "additional raw log entries" (though not strictly required by the task, it enhances precision in ground truth).
- Uses "case data" (accurate but broader) vs. ground truth's pinpoint "event rows" and activity-specific "concrete times for any “Approve Invoice” execution". 

These are small phrasing/emphasis differences under utmost strictness, but substance is identical—no factual errors, inventions, or deviations.
