The LLM answer accurately identifies all functional changes, including the correct tasks added, the removed task, and both gateway type changes. However, it does not reproduce the required format exactly:

- It omits bullet points before each list item and does not use hyphens, as in the ground truth.
- Gateway changes lack indentation and spacing ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" should match the format and spacing of the ground truth, i.e., "- Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").
- It uses "**" for section headings instead of the plain headings as shown in the ground truth.

These formatting discrepancies are significant per the instruction to be "utmost strict," with even small errors resulting in notable point loss. However, all substantive, verifiable differences are correctly captured, so this is a high but not perfect score.
