8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact matches in content (IDs, names, and gateway type shifts) to the ground truth, adhering to the prompt's requirements for verifiable differences only, no extras, and the specified order/headings. However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.5 points total for small formatting errors: use of bold markdown on headings (vs. plain text), absence of bullet points (-) before each list item (6 instances across sections), and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (no indented "exclusive â†’ parallel" under the colon).
