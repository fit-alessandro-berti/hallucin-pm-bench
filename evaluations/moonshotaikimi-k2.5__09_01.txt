**9.8**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in core conclusion (cannot derive/compute due to absent temporal data) and reasoning (explicit redaction/lack of timestamps/durations), fully aligning with the system instruction to "state clearly that the requested value cannot be derived." It matches the user's 1) / 2) structure perfectly, lists exact instances accurately, and correctly dismisses the irrelevant benchmark with precise details not contradicted by ground truth.

Minor deductions (-0.2): 
- Phrasing differences ("cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; "cycle time (activity duration)" vs. "cycle-time"; no mention of "ordering information," though irrelevant without times).
- Slightly more verbose elaboration on benchmark (accurate but expands beyond ground truth's brevity).

No factual errors, fabrications, or non-compliance; exceeds ground truth in thoroughness without deviation.
