8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, capturing all key decision points and required documents with correct terminology and no introduction of forbidden standard loan elements. However, under utmost strictness, deductions are applied for minor phrasing inconsistencies, structural differences, and incomplete alignment with the ground truth's exact wording and format:

#### Decision Points (Strong match, minor deductions: -0.5 total)
- **Content accuracy**: All three decision points are correctly identified and described without errors in logic or process flow (e.g., Underwriter Alignment Gate handles the ≤2 point difference escalation properly; Amount Threshold Decision correctly branches at €15,000; MBA is approval/reject vote).
- **Differences from ground truth**:
  - Phrasing: LLM uses "within ±2 points" and question format ("Are the scores...?"), while ground truth uses "differ by ≤ 2" in declarative style—subtle but not identical (-0.2).
  - Sequence specification: Ground truth explicitly notes positions ("after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which LLM omits (-0.2).
  - Verbosity: LLM adds explanatory arrows (e.g., "If YES → proceed") and an extra note on MBA triggering, making it less concise than ground truth's bullet-style summary (-0.1).
  - Capitalization: Ground truth capitalizes "Approve" and "Reject"; LLM does not (-0.0, negligible).

#### Required Documents (Very close match, minor deductions: -1.0 total)
- **Content accuracy**: Lists all six exact documents from the prompt, with no omissions or additions.
- **Differences from ground truth**:
  - Wording variations: 
    - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's "(≤ 3 months)"—extra "old" (-0.2).
    - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"—extra "single" and "or" vs. "/" (-0.3).
    - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"—extra "template" (-0.3).
  - Format: LLM uses bullets; ground truth uses numbered list (-0.1).
  - Omission: LLM lacks ground truth's parenthetical note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which emphasizes the non-standard nature—though not strictly required by the prompt, its absence is a completeness gap (-0.1).

The answer adheres to the prompt's rules (e.g., exact activity names like "Underwriter Alignment Gate"), making it effective and faithful. Total score reflects near-perfection with penalties only for small, non-substantive deviations that could imply slight paraphrasing over verbatim fidelity.
