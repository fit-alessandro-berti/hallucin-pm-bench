8.2

**Reasoning:**

The LLM answer is close to the ground truth but diverges in a few notable aspects, which—according to your strict grading—must be penalized. Here’s a breakdown:

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM correctly identifies and uses the exact activity names (“Underwriter Alignment Gate”, “Amount Threshold Decision”, “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)”), places them in correct order, and precisely describes the logic.
- The slight points loss comes from the LLM not explicitly stating that “Amount Threshold Decision” occurs *after Neighbourhood Feedback Check* (it’s implied, but not stated). In strict grading, not specifying the sequence can be considered a material omission.
- In the “Final Micro-loan Board Approval,” the wording “Only triggered if amount ≥ €15 000” is not as explicit or formal as ground truth, which states “the board votes Approve or Reject.”
- The LLM does not list the **decision points as a numbered list with activity names in bold** for maximum clarity, unlike the ground truth (minor formatting/clarity point).

**Required Documents:**
- All required documents are correctly listed, with exact names from the process. The LLM includes all six, in the appropriate style.
- The LLM's description includes both “Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)” (matching the process), whereas ground truth abbreviates “pay-stub/tax slip.” This is fine—no penalty here.
- The LLM omits the final clarifying note: “No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed,” a caveat that prevents any ambiguity for the reader. Strict interpretation requires deducting for this missing explicit statement.

**Other considerations:**
- The LLM never introduces outside or “standard” terminology, faithfully uses the process names, and does not invent new steps.
- The response structure is clear, explicit, and bullet- or list-based, as requested.

**Summary:**  
- Deductions are mainly for small omissions (lack of explicit sequence for Amount Threshold, lack of clarifying note at the end).
- No major inaccuracies or invented steps/terms.
- Therefore, a score of **8.2** reflects a solid, mostly-accurate, but not perfect, answer under strict criteria.
