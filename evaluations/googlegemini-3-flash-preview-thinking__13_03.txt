8.2

### Rationale for Score (strict evaluation):
- **Part 1 (perfect match, 10/10)**: Both correctly state "1". Minor extras (LLM: case ID; GT: timestamp) are negligible as question asks only for count.
- **Part 2 (7.4/10, significant deductions)**: ≤120 words (LLM ~85, compliant). Shares core ideas (small sample; naming inconsistency via auto-fraud variants), but differences penalize heavily:
  - **Speculation violation (-1.5)**: LLM speculates "Other manual checks might exist under different labels" — breaches "no speculation" rule; GT avoids, sticking to observed autos and matching risks.
  - **Added irrelevant/less precise reason (-1.0)**: Duplicates/noise valid observation but weakly tied to manual fraud estimation (assumes event-ratio metric, unstated; inflates denominator minor vs. sampling variance). GT omits, focuses sharply.
  - **Missed quantitative rigor (-0.5)**: GT quantifies sample (14 events/3 cases/<2hrs, 0-7% swing, confidence interval, rare-event error); LLM vague "statistically insufficient".
  - **Structure/depth (-0.6)**: Bullets clear but less fluid; infers sloppiness broadly vs. GT's precise fuzzy/strict matching distortion.
- **Overall**: Strong overlap (~75%) but strict policy adherence, omissions, extras/speculation deduct heavily. Not identical = major loss.
