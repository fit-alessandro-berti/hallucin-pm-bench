### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, ~4/10)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no synonyms or leaks from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). However, added activities use inconsistent phrasing (e.g., "Compliance Officer approval" lacks capitalization and bolding as in ground truth; "Schedule the payment" and "Notify the originating analyst" are overly verbose and not aligned with ground truth's concise, capitalized style). This violates the strict "do not rename" rule for all activities.
  
- **Activity Coverage (Low, ~2/10)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** from the narrative without renaming, merging, or adding. The ground truth identifies 6 activities, interpreting "schedule the payment" and "release the funds" as a single "Release Funds", and implicitly folding "notify" into it (no separate row). The LLM adds 4 extra rows ("Compliance Officer approval", "Schedule the payment", "Release the funds", "Notify the originating analyst"), exceeding the narrative's scope and ground truth structure. It also fails to merge logically, resulting in redundancy. The four core activities are present but not exhaustive in matching ground truth's interpretation.

- **RACI Assignments (Very Low, ~1/10)**: Strict comparison shows mismatches in nearly every cell, with small errors (e.g., missing "I" or "C") causing major deviations:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office correct as R/A (but LLM uses slash notation vs. ground truth's comma and bold); Compliance Analyst wrong (I vs. C); misses Treasury Ops I; uses empty vs. – for Compliance Officer.
  - **KYC Review**: Compliance Analyst correct as R/A; but adds erroneous Front-Office I (should be –); misses Compliance Officer C and Treasury Ops I.
  - **AML Screening**: Compliance Analyst correct as R/A; misses Compliance Officer C, Treasury Ops I, and Front-Office –.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Completely wrong—LLM assigns R/A to Compliance Analyst; ground truth splits as R (Analyst), A (Officer), adds C (Front-Office) and I (Treasury Ops).
  - Added rows: "Compliance Officer approval" partially matches ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" but misses Front-Office I; "Schedule the payment" and "Release the funds" have partial overlaps (e.g., Treasury R/A) but wrong/missing involvements (e.g., no Compliance Officer C in Release, erroneous Analyst I vs. C); "Notify" is entirely extraneous with no ground truth equivalent.
  - Overall, ~70% of cells are incorrect or incomplete, with no consistent use of – for no involvement (empties instead).

- **Formatting and Structure (Low, ~2/10)**: Markdown table is present, but lacks ground truth's bolding on activities (**Intake Vetting**) and cells (**R, A**). Uses "R/A" shorthand vs. explicit "R, A". Empties instead of – violate the key point on dashes. No key points section, though not explicitly required.

- **Overall Strictness**: Per instructions, even minor discrepancies (e.g., notation, missing single roles) deduct significantly. The LLM captures the core vocabulary but fails on activity fidelity, RACI accuracy, and no-add/no-merge rules, resulting in a fragmented matrix far from ground truth. Score reflects ~30% alignment.
