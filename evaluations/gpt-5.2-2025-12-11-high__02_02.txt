**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content, sequence, and ordering:

- **Q1/A1**: Correct count (3); extra listing of cases is accurate and harmless.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order), ignoring irrelevant escaping in ground truth.
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), one per line, alphabetically ordered; descriptive label "(alphabetical)" is accurate and aligns with prompt; minor formatting (no dashes vs. ground truth's "-") is not required by prompt and does not alter facts.

No extras, missing elements, fabrications, or hallucinations. Perfect adherence.
