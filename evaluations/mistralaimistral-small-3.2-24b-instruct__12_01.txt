**Score: 8.5**

**Explanation:**  
The LLM answer accurately identifies that the claim is **inaccurate** and provides the correct reasoning for each relevant case:

- It correctly points out, for both case 1001 and 1003, that "Authorize_Refund" comes after (not before) "Update_Inventory."
- For case 1002, it notes that "Update_Inventory" does not occur, making the case irrelevant to the claim.

**Minor issues:**
- The LLM answer says, for case 1002, “no 'Update_Inventory' in this case, so irrelevant to the claim.” While this is not strictly incorrect, the ground truth notes that just one counterexample (“always” disproved) suffices—even not appearing at all already violates the “always” claim, so it would have been slightly more precise to explicitly say that.
- The LLM answer slightly overstates the irrelevance of case 1002; it is relevant in disproving “always.”
- The answer could be marginally clearer or more explicit, as in the ground truth, about no case matching the claimed ordering.

There are no major factual errors, but the above subtlety justifies a modest deduction for strictness, yielding **8.5**.
