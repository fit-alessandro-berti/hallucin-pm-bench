The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and accurately describes the reversed ordering in Cases 1001 and 1003 with relevant citations. However, it deducts points for: (1) incorrectly labeling Case 1002 as "irrelevant" instead of recognizing the absence of `Update_Inventory` as direct disproof of the "always" claim; (2) including unnecessary/irrelevant detail about `Refund_Issued` in Case 1002; and (3) lacking the ground truth's precision on "immediately precede" across all cases and explicit line references, which slightly weakens evidentiary rigor under strict evaluation.
