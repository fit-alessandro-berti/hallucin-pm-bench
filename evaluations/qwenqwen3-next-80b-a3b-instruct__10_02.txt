6.0

**Evaluation and justification:**

1. **Use of Mandated Vocabulary:**
   - Used “Transaction Analyst” and “Regulatory Liaison” appropriately.
   - Used “KYC Review” (in one task).
   - However, in some tasks, not all mandated vocabulary from the source (e.g., "KYC Review" as its own task/activity label) is as strictly used/formatted as in ground truth.
   - “Operations Manager” is missing entirely from the LLM answer—a significant deviation from the ground truth, which includes this role *and assigns “A” (Accountable) in every activity*.

2. **Structural Differences:**
   - The LLM answer:
      - Includes an explicit “Notes” column not present in the ground truth.
      - Adds/extends activities and splits/merges steps versus the ground truth (e.g., “Notify Regulatory Liaison of case closure”—not found in the ground truth).
      - Merges "Ensure SWIFT message is sent / Archive case file" into tasks that don’t map identically to the ground truth steps and misses precise mapping and mandated wording.
   - The ground truth table precisely follows the enforced naming/step order and granularity.

3. **Task Naming and Mapping:**
   - The LLM answer uses more verbose (and at times, imprecise) task labels instead of the enforced, concise, mandated activities (e.g., “Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system” vs “Receive Payment Instruction”).
   - “KYC Review” is not always used as the task name—it appears as “Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary”, not “KYC Review”.

4. **RACI Assignments:**
   - The LLM answer never assigns “A” (Accountable) to anyone except Regulatory Liaison (for “Approve high-risk transactions”); the ground truth makes the Operations Manager *Accountable for all tasks*.
   - IT Support is only Responsible (“R”) for technical steps in the LLM version, but in the ground truth, IT Support is Responsible for “Archive Record”, and is otherwise Consulted or Informed. The mappings differ.
   - The LLM answer sometimes assigns unnecessary “I” (Informed) or “C” (Consulted) roles not reflected in the ground truth.

5. **Omissions:**
   - “Operations Manager” is a required role per the ground truth, but entirely omitted from the LLM answer. This is a major deviation.

**Conclusion:**  
- The LLM answer shows awareness of the vocabulary rules and the RACI concept, but makes significant mapping errors:
  - It omits a mandated role (“Operations Manager”).
  - Sometimes fails to use the exact required vocabulary as task/activity labels.
  - Grants improper RACI responsibility assignments versus the ground truth.
  - Task granularity and sequence deviate from the ground truth.
- These are substantial enough to reduce the score considerably, but basic structure and partial adherence still merit a score above failing.

**Strict score: 6.0**
