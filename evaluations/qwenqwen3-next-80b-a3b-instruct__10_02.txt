3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Under strict evaluation criteria, the LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, content, and fidelity to the source process, warranting a low score despite partial adherence to vocabulary mandates. Key differences include:

- **Roles**: The LLM omits "Operations Manager" (present in all GT rows as the primary Accountable party), replacing it with an extraneous "Notes" column for explanations (not in GT). This fundamentally alters the RACI assignments, as GT positions Operations Manager as the oversight layer (e.g., A in every task), while LLM overloads Regulatory Liaison with accountability (e.g., A for approvals). IT Support is retained correctly, but the missing role breaks the GT's hierarchical balance. (-2.0 points for core structural omission).

- **Tasks**: LLM expands to 8 tasks (splitting "Release Payment" into separate "Release" and "Ensure SWIFT message," and adding a novel "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case closure" task with invented R/C assignments), versus GT's concise 6 tasks. This introduces unsubstantiated granularity (e.g., no source basis for IT as R/C on notification; GT folds notification into "Archive Record" implicitly without a separate row). Task wording partially aligns (e.g., "KYC Review" is used correctly), but others diverge (e.g., LLM's verbose "Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system" vs. GT's succinct "Receive Payment Instruction"; no bolding of mandated terms like GT's "**KYC Review**"). Omissions include GT's mandated phrasing like "Archive Record" (LLM uses "Archive case file"). (-2.5 points for inflation, invention, and imprecise mapping of source text steps).

- **RACI Assignments**: Mismatches in nearly every row, undermining accuracy:
  - Receive: LLM (R TA, I RL, I IT) ignores GT's A Ops and C IT.
  - Screen: LLM (R TA, C RL, I IT) mismatches GT's A RL, I Ops, C IT (RL is A, not C; no C for RL in LLM's intent).
  - KYC Review: LLM (I TA, R RL, I IT) vs. GT (C TA, R RL, A Ops, I IT)—misses C for TA and A for Ops.
  - Approve: LLM (I TA, A RL, I IT) vs. GT (C TA, R RL, A Ops, I IT)—RL is A (wrong per GT, where it's R) and misses C TA.
  - Release: LLM (R TA, I RL, I IT) partially aligns but ignores GT's A Ops, C IT; LLM's split SWIFT row (R IT) further deviates, as GT consolidates under "Release Payment" with C IT.
  - Archive: LLM (I TA, I RL, R IT) vs. GT (C TA, I RL, A Ops, R IT)—misses C TA and A Ops.
  - Extra Notify row: Entirely absent in GT, with questionable assignments (e.g., C RL on their own notification is illogical).
  These errors compound, as RACI requires precise delegation (only one A per task in both, but GT consistently uses Ops for it). (-2.0 points for pervasive inaccuracies).

- **Formatting and Extras**: Markdown table is clear, but LLM adds a "Notes" column with interpretive commentary (e.g., "Regulatory Liaison consulted on complex matches"—not in source or GT), a full Legend (GT has abbreviated), and a closing note on vocabulary (redundant, as GT embeds confirmation). GT uses bolding for emphasis (e.g., **R**, **KYC Review**) and a header "Task / Activity (mandated wording)," which LLM lacks. No omissions of source steps, but expansions dilute fidelity. (-0.5 points for unnecessary additions and minor stylistic mismatches).

- **Vocabulary Adherence**: Strong point—correctly uses “KYC Review,” “Regulatory Liaison,” “Transaction Analyst” exclusively, avoiding forbidden terms (e.g., no "compliance officer" or "payment clerk"). This prevents a total failure but can't offset other flaws. (+1.5 points relative to baseline).

Overall, while the LLM covers the source text's essence and follows vocabulary strictly, it introduces inventions, omits a key role, and mismatches assignments extensively, resulting in a table that doesn't faithfully represent the GT's consolidated, mandated structure. Small errors (e.g., task wording, bolding) amplify to significant deductions per instructions. A score closer to 10 would require near-identical task count, roles, and assignments.
