8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two sets of concurrent tasks in the exact order required, with no extraneous information about other processes. The core content (task names and grouping) matches the ground truth precisely. However, it loses points for minor formatting differences: lack of descriptive labels (e.g., "Set 1 – first parallel block"), absence of parallel notation (‖ vs. comma in braces), no bolding or backticks, and omission of the confirmatory statement about no other parallel tasks, which ensures completeness against the ground truth. Under strict evaluation, these presentational variances deduct 1.5 points from a perfect score.
