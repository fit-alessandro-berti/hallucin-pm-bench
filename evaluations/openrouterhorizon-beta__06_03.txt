The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of parallel tasks in Process B, reflecting the structure: 
1) {Quality_Check, Update_Inventory} 
2) {Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement}

It presents them in the required numbered order and gives no information about Processes A or C, as instructed.

**Errors / Omissions:**
- The answer omits brief contextual clarifications found in the ground truth (e.g., labeling “first parallel block” and “second parallel block,” and the final explanatory line “No other tasks…”). 
- It uses curly braces `{}` instead of the explicit parallel notation (`‖`) as in the ground truth.
- It does not highlight or boldface set descriptors though this is very minor.

While these are largely formatting and clarity differences rather than fact errors, the prompt demands the utmost strictness; thus, these small but clear presentation and notation differences cost a full point.
