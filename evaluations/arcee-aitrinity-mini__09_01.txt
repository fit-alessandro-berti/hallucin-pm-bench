The LLM answer is an exact match in intent, structure, accuracy, and strict adherence to the system policy (declining due to absent data). It precisely mirrors the ground truth's reasoning on missing timestamps/durations, adds valid note on benchmark irrelevance (supported by context), uses numbered response matching the query, and avoids any fabrication. No differences or errors.
