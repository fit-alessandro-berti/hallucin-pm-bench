The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately justifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise citations to events, matching the ground truth's assessment on those points. It also briefly confirms satisfaction of Rules 1 and 5, aligning with the ground truth. However, under strict evaluation, the omission of any mention of Rule 4 (which the ground truth explicitly verifies as satisfied) represents an incomplete coverage of the full rule set, warranting a minor deduction despite the correct outcome and no factual errors in the addressed rules.
