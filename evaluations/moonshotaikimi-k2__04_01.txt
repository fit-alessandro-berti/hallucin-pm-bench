8.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies the NON-COMPLIANT status, and correctly pinpoints the two violated rules: Rule 2 (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods in presence of Expedite_Flag) and Rule 3 (Three_way_match too late after Goods_Received).
- It also explicitly confirms satisfaction of Rules 1 and 5.

However, it omits mention and explicit assessment of Rule 4, which, although not violated, must nevertheless be checked to be maximally thorough. The ground truth answer explicitly states that Rule 4 is satisfied and provides justification; the LLM answer does not mention Rule 4 at all.

This lack of explicit, comprehensive justification—omitting a rule check—represents a "small error" that should result in a significant deduction based on the grading instructions. Therefore, I assign 8.0.
