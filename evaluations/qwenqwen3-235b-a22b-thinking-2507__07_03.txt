The LLM answer contains all the correct differences, but loses significant points for the following reasons:

- Does not prefix added and removed tasks or gateway changes with bullet points ("-") as in the ground truth, which is an explicit formatting expectation.
- Lists added/removed task/gateway entries without dashes, which is not strictly verbatim with the required output style.
- The formatting for gateway changes omits the required indentation/alignment seen in the ground truth (e.g., the spacing in "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel").

The factual content is accurate, but small errors in layout and formatting (which the prompt requires to be followed strictly) reflect a meaningful deduction as requested.
