### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Content Accuracy (Perfect, no deduction)**: The LLM correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). No extras, omissions, or unauthorized commentary; strictly adheres to verifiable differences only.
- **Structure and Headings (Perfect, no deduction)**: Headings are verbatim, in exact order, and output contains only the required elements.
- **Formatting Differences (Minor deductions, -1.0 total)**: 
  - Missing bullet points ("-") before each item in all three sections, matching the ground truth's list style (-0.8).
  - No alignment spaces in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel" in ground truth vs. no spaces in LLM) (-0.2).
- **Strictness Note**: These are small presentational inconsistencies, but per instructions, they warrant a deduction despite semantic equivalence. Larger errors (e.g., missing changes) would score far lower.
