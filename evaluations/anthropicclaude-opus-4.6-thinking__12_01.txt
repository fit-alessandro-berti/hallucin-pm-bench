**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Factual accuracy (perfect, no loss):** Both correctly identify the claim as false/inaccurate. All case analyses match exactly: reversed order in 1001/1003, absence in 1002 disproving "always", no instance of "Authorize_Refund immediately before Update_Inventory". LLM correctly notes non-adjacency in 1003 (Quality_Check intervenes) and reversal despite adjacency in 1001—aligns with/strengthens ground truth.
- **Comprehensiveness (+):** LLM adds precise timestamps (directly from data), table for clarity, explicit "immediately adjacent?" check—superior detail without invention.
- **Differences causing deductions (-0.8 total):**
  - **Length/structure (-0.4):** Prompt specifies "short justification"; ground truth is concise bullets (~100 words). LLM is verbose (~250 words) with table/summary headings—violates "short", stylistic mismatch.
  - **Verdict phrasing (-0.2):** "false" vs "**inaccurate**" + "**Short verdict:**"; minor semantic/style diff.
  - **Citations (-0.2):** Timestamps (exact) vs line numbers (implicit in data listing)—both valid but not identical format.
- **Strictness applied:** No factual errors, but any format/content divergence (even enhancements) penalized significantly per instructions. 9.2 reflects near-identical substance with polish, minus presentation deviations.
