7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the value cannot be derived due to missing duration information, aligning with the ground truth's core conclusion and the system instruction to state this clearly. However, it scores lower due to several strict differences: (1) it omits explicit mention of "Review Contract" or "cycle time" in the response (implied but not direct, unlike the ground truth); (2) it fails to address question 2 by providing no brief explanation of the (non-existent) calculation or deeper reasoning on absent elements like timestamps, ordering, or the risk of fabrication; (3) the phrasing is less precise and comprehensive, lacking the ground truth's structured format, bolding, and warning against fabrication, which makes it feel incomplete for a full response to both prompt parts. These omissions and brevity represent small but significant gaps under utmost strictness, preventing a higher score.
