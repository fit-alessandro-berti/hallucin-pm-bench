The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Question 1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence required for Question 2, with a concise explanation that accurately describes the enabling marking (tokens in P2 and P5) without T3 firing. No factual errors exist, and it adheres to the ≤120-word limit. However, it lacks the detailed step-by-step markings and the confirmatory note on T3's subsequent disablement present in the ground truth, reducing completeness and depth—significant deductions for these omissions under strict evaluation of differences.
