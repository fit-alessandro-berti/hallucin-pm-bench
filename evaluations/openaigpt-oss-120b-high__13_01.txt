The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, structure, and fidelity to the log data for questions 1-3, with precise calculation and no inferences beyond the provided lines. For question 4, it provides two clear, relevant reasons that align directly with two of the specified options (small sample size and temporal bias), with elaborations that derive logically from the log's limited scope without hallucinating events or unjustified details. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "Extremely small" vs. "Small"; added examples like "weekends/promotions" as illustrative hypotheticals consistent with the ground truth's style) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they enhance clarity without deviation.
