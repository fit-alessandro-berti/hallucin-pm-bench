9.4

**Evaluation:**

1. The answer for question 1 ("1 time") is fully correct.
2. For question 2, the answer provides the correct calculation, formula, and the exact percentage to two decimal places (5.56%), as required—fully correct.
3. For question 3, the answer lists **A1002** only, exact match—fully correct.
4. For question 4, the answer provides two reasons:

   - “Extremely small sample size”—this matches closely to "small sample size" in ground truth, with explanation.
   - “Limited temporal coverage (single‑day snapshot)”—this is equivalent to “temporal bias” in ground truth, also well-explained.

**Minor Issue / Deduction:**
- In Q4, the LLM adds explicit examples in parentheses (e.g., “higher on weekends, during promotions, etc.”), which—while plausible—are not inferable from the event log and introduce (slightly) extraneous speculation. The system instructions are clear to not assume or infer any events not shown explicitly, and while the illustration does not strictly claim these scenarios have happened, it departs from strict reproducibility.

Given the instruction to penalize even small deviations significantly, this warrants a deduction, though the core answers remain precise and correct.

**Final score: 9.4**
