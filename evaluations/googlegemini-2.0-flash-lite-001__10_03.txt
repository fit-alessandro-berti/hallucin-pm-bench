2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt but contains critical deviations that warrant a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The four authorized terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") are used correctly without synonyms or leaks. No points lost here, as this is a core strength.

- **Activities Coverage and Fidelity (Major Deduction)**: The prompt mandates covering **every activity** from the narrative without renaming, merging, or adding. The ground truth identifies six precise activities derived directly from the process (Intake Vetting for Preliminary Assessment; KYC Review and AML Screening as distinct steps; Risk Scoring; Compliance Officer Approval for escalation; Release Funds). 
  - LLM correctly includes the first four but invents "Schedule Payment" (a rename/merge of non-escalated path, not a standalone activity) and "Notify Originating Analyst" (an added, minor post-action not treated as a core activity in ground truth).
  - It omits "Compliance Officer Approval" entirely, a key escalation step.
  - This results in ~33% activity mismatch (2 added, 1 missing, 3 renamed/merged), a significant error reflecting poor fidelity to the narrative.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction)**: Assignments must align with the narrative's roles/responsibilities. Ground truth uses combined "R,A" where one role holds both, dashes (–) for no involvement, and context-specific consultations/informations (e.g., Officer only accountable for Risk Scoring/escalation, not earlier steps).
  - Only "Risk Scoring" matches ground truth exactly (C for Front-Office Analyst, R for Compliance Analyst, A for Compliance Officer, I for Treasury Ops).
  - All other rows diverge substantially:
    - Intake Vetting: LLM incorrectly assigns C to Compliance Analyst/Officer (narrative shows no involvement); ground truth has R,A only for Front-Office Analyst (as initial performer and approver), with – for Officer.
    - KYC Review/AML Screening: LLM assigns C to Front-Office Analyst and A to Officer (unsupported); ground truth has – for Front-Office, R,A for Compliance Analyst (as performer), C for Officer.
    - LLM's added/misnamed activities ("Schedule Payment", "Release Funds", "Notify") have fabricated assignments (e.g., A to Officer for Release Funds, but narrative shows Treasury Ops handles post-approval without Officer accountability).
  - No use of "R,A" combinations or dashes, leading to inflated involvement (e.g., unnecessary C/A roles). This misrepresents ~80% of assignments.

- **Formatting and Output Strictness (Minor Deduction)**: Markdown table is used correctly, but lacks ground truth's bolding for activities/roles (e.g., **Intake Vetting**) and explanatory notes. Introductory text ("Okay, here's...") is extraneous, though not explicitly banned.

- **Overall Strictness**: Even minor phrasing errors (e.g., no dashes) compound with structural failures. The answer captures the four core terms but fails to produce a faithful, complete RACI without additions/omissions, justifying a score well below 5.0. Partial credit for vocabulary and partial activity overlap prevents a 1.0.
