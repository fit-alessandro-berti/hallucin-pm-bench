5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the vocabulary policy and covers most activities and roles, but falls short in several critical aspects compared to the ground truth:

**Strengths:**
- Uses only the authorized vocabulary for the four specified activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) with no synonym leakage.
- Does not rename or merge activities.
- Formats a RACI matrix as requested.

**Major Deviations:**
1. **Missing Activities:** Omits "Compliance Officer Approval" as a distinct activity present in the ground truth, and adds "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst"—which are not required.
2. **Incorrect R/A Assignments:**
   - Fails to use "R, A" for dual Responsible & Accountable assignments (e.g., Intake Vetting for Front-Office Analyst; KYC Review and AML Screening for Compliance Analyst; Compliance Officer Approval for Compliance Officer; Release Funds for Treasury Ops).
   - Assigns Accountable (“A”) status incorrectly; e.g., Compliance Officer is “A” for KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring, which is not present in the ground truth for the first two.
   - Assigns Responsible status too widely (e.g., “R” for Compliance Officer on KYC Review and AML Screening).
3. **Omissions & Redundancy Notation Errors:**
   - Fails to use "–" to denote inactivity in activities where a role is not involved (as required in the prompt and shown in ground truth).
4. **Activity Set Inconsistency:**
   - The matrix in the answer does not correspond precisely to the process narrative or the ground truth: extra activities present, and one is missing.

**Conclusion:**  
Despite using the correct vocabulary and table format, multiple important errors—missing/extra activities, incorrect R/A assignments, and notation inconsistencies—justify a severe penalty. Strict grading and step-by-step comparison with the ground truth warrant no more than a 5.0.
