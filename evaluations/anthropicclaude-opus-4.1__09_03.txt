9.0

The LLM answer is essentially correct and fit for purpose. It states directly that the computation is impossible, and provides a precise explanation referencing the lack of data (no start_time or complete_time values, all records removed). 

Minor points are deducted for slightly verbose phrasing and small additional details (such as mentioning the SLA catalogue's average from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice", and clarifying why that does not help) which, while not incorrect, go slightly beyond the strictly necessary. The ground truth is more concise and tightly focused on the core reason.

There are no factual errors, no guessing, and no use of outside knowledge, matching requirements. For these reasons, a 9.0 is warranted.
