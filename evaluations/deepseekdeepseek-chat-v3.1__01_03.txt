6.5

**Justification:**

### a) Decision points

- The LLM correctly identifies the *two* decision points: the conditional skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check and the “TriVote” approval gate.  
- **Wording:** The LLM’s phrasing on the Tri-Color-Risk-Check is accurate, specifying both risk rating and amount, and the skip/conduct logic is correct.
- **TriVote:** The rule “at least two out of three” is stated precisely.
- **Minor issue:** The LLM refers to “approval from at least two out of three designated officers” rather than explicitly stating that “Sustainability Officer participation is mandatory in every loan cycle,” which, for strict grading, is a minor omission; more closely mirroring the exact process rules would be better.

### b) Required documents

- **Errors:**  
    - The LLM merges “Signed Offer Sheet 77” into “Offer Sheet 77” in their list, failing to note that the signed version is separately required at step 8.  
    - “Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow” are grouped together as one bullet when in the ground truth they are three distinct documents (this matters since the prompt demands an exact, complete list).
    - “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is missing from the LLM’s list (it is not just a signed version of the earlier document but a separate submission by the applicant).
    - The LLM correctly lists “Deck Memo,” “ID Matrix Declaration,” and “Loan Dossier 2025” in order.

### Summary

- **SECTION (a):** LLM’s summary is precise and nearly perfect, with only a very slight lack of clarification on Sustainability Officer’s universal involvement.
- **SECTION (b):** There are notable but not catastrophic flaws: grouping three documents as one, omitting “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” and thus producing a list that is not strictly accurate or complete as demanded.

### Score guidance

According to the instruction, “Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points.” The omissions in the document listing are more than just minor, since document tracking matters in loan processing. The lack of explicit statement about the Sustainability Officer’s mandatory participation is smaller, but still a detectable miss given the instructions.

**Therefore, the answer earns 6.5/10.**
