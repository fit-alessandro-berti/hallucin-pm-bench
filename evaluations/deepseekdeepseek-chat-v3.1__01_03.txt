### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (7/10):** The LLM correctly identifies both decision points and summarizes their rules accurately in one sentence each, closely aligning with the ground truth (e.g., "Low or Medium and ≤ €250 000" for the risk skip; "at least two out of three" for TriVote). Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., omitting "otherwise proceeds to review" and not quoting "record 'Approve.'"), which under strictness warrant a noticeable loss despite overall fidelity.
  
- **Part (b) - Documents List (2/10):** Severe inaccuracies in structure and completeness. The ground truth requires a precise, sequential list of 9 distinct documents, treating the three Scorecards as separate items (first appearances in step 3) and Signed Offer Sheet 77 as a distinct entry (step 8) from the unsigned Offer Sheet 77 (step 7). The LLM groups the Scorecards into one entry (reducing count), merges Signed Offer Sheet 77 into a description without listing it separately, and omits it as a standalone item, resulting in only 6 entries instead of 9. Extraneous descriptions (e.g., "initial application form") deviate from the prompt's "list" format. No hallucinations of absent documents (e.g., KYC/AML), but the fragmentation and incompleteness are major errors, leading to substantial point loss under strict evaluation criteria.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity:** The response is well-organized but introduces avoidable errors in part (b) that significantly diverge from the ground truth's exactness (e.g., 33% fewer distinct items). Total score reflects strong part (a) offset by weak part (b), with strictness applied to penalize even structural misinterpretations heavily.
