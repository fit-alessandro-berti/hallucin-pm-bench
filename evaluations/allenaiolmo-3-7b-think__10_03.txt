**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, RACI assignments, formatting, and adherence to instructions, warranting a low score under utmost strictness (small errors = major point loss; here, errors are large and pervasive):

#### 1. **Structural & Formatting Errors** (-2.5 points base penalty):
   - Added unauthorized activities ("Approval Decision (High Risk)", "Scheduling Payment", "Funds Release & Notification") violating "do not ... add activities" (prompt). Ground truth adds only two minimally descriptive ones ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). LLM's extras merge/rename inaccurately (e.g., no "Scheduling Payment" in narrative as separate).
   - 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6 → over-expansion.
   - No bolding on activities or key **R, A** cells (ground truth standardizes this).
   - Cells use inconsistent "R,A," (trailing comma, no spaces) vs. ground truth "**R, A**" or single letters/dashes.
   - Blanks for no involvement vs. explicit "–" (ground truth standard; key point specifies dash marks no involvement).
   - Header minor diffs (spacing), but exacerbates sloppiness.

#### 2. **RACI Assignment Errors** (-3.5 points; ~70% of cells mismatch):
   | Activity (GT Name) | Key Mismatches (LLM vs. GT) |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------|
   | **Intake Vetting** | Misses Comp **C**, Treas **I**, Off **–** (only partial Front **R, A**). |
   | **KYC Review**     | Misses Off **C**, Treas **I**; Front wrongly blank (GT **–**). |
   | **AML Screening**  | Identical misses as KYC. |
   | **Risk Scoring**   | Fundamentally wrong: Comp "**R,A**" (GT only **R**); misses Front **C**, Off **A**, Treas **I**. |
   | **Compliance Officer Approval** | Name mismatch; misses Front **I**, Treas **–**; partial Comp **C**, Off **R, A**. |
   | **Release Funds** (LLM as "Funds Release & Notification" + extra row) | Misses Front **I**, Comp **C**, Off **C**; extra "Scheduling Payment" row fragments & wrongly assigns (e.g., Treas **R,A,I** overkill). |

   - ~15/24 cells wrong/missing (strict cell-by-cell: blanks ≠ **–**; partials ≠ full).
   - Ignores narrative nuances (e.g., Officer **A** for Risk Scoring/escalation; "originating analyst" = Front **I**; low-risk implicit approval flows to Treas).

#### 3. **Vocabulary/Policy Compliance** (+1.0 partial credit):
   - Correctly uses **all four mandated terms exactly** (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring); no leaks of disallowed synonyms. Matches key points.
   - But added activities use unauthorized phrasings, indirectly violating "using only the authorized vocabulary."

#### 4. **Overall Fidelity to Prompt/Narrative** (-2.0):
   - Fails "covering **every activity and role**" accurately (misses Consulted/Informed across roles; e.g., no Front **C** on Risk, Treas **I** everywhere).
   - No merging/renaming observed in mandated four, but extras do both.

**Total: Starts at 10.0 → -8.0 penalties = 2.0**. Partial credit for core vocab & Front/Comp mains; zero for accuracy/strict rules. Unusable as-is vs. ground truth.
