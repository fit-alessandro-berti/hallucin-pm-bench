The LLM answer is essentially correct and clearly explains why the average cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval for "Approve Invoice" cannot be computed given the redacted nature of Artefact A. It also correctly notes that Artefact B does not fill in the missing information for the specific metric requested.

Differences and points of deduction:
- The ground truth is sharper and maximally concise (“Impossible — the necessary data are absent.”), immediately stating the impossibility before elaborating.
- The LLM answer, while clear and precise, could be slightly more direct. For example, it first restates the impossibility, then gives supporting explanation—this is a minor verbosity compared to the ground truth.
- The ground truth also references the need for “additional raw log entries,” a clarifying concluding statement enhancing completeness. The LLM answer concludes with a similar statement but could still condense or unify its reasoning slightly.

Overall, this is a highly accurate and appropriate answer, penalized minimally for being a touch more verbose/less direct than the ground truth.
