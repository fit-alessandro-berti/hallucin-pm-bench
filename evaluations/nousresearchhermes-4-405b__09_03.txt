The LLM answer is nearly identical in content, accuracy, and adherence to the task requirements compared to the ground truth. Both correctly identify the impossibility of computation due to redacted timestamps and rows in Artefact A, provide a precise explanation without guessing or using external knowledge, and maintain plain text format. Minor differences (e.g., explicit numbering to mirror the task's structure, brief mention of Artefact B's irrelevance, and phrasing like "dispersion" vs. "standard deviation") are stylistic and do not introduce errors or deviations from the core intent, preserving full fidelity under strict evaluation.
