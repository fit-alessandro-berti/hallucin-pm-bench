The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" with a valid, minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3 in a reachable marking, including accurate marking traces and brief justification of T5's enabling rule (p3 ≥ 1, p4 = 0 via inhibitor arc). This directly matches the prompt's requirements.

Minor differences from ground truth (not errors, but stylistic/content gaps under strict evaluation):
- Shorter sequence (stops after T5; ground truth extends to T3/T4 for completeness).
- Less precise marking notation ({p1, p2} vs. explicit `p1 = 1, p2 = 1`).
- Basic justification (enabling check) vs. ground truth's deeper insight ("must" fire before T3 due to permanent disablement post-T3).
- Trivial phrasing/step numbering variance (e.g., "step 4" for 3rd firing in numbered list).

No factual errors; core content aligns ~95%. Significant loss avoided as differences are non-essential to correctness.
