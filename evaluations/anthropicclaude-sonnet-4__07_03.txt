9.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, correctly identifying all added tasks, the removed task, and both gateway type changes with proper IDs, names, and format (e.g., "exclusive â†’ parallel"). However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.0 point total for minor formatting deviations: (1) headings use Markdown bold (**ADDED TASKS**) instead of plain verbatim text as in the ground truth and prompt example, and (2) the second gateway line lacks the exact spacing/alignment (single space after colon vs. multiple spaces in ground truth for visual alignment).
