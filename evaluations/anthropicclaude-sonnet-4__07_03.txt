9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and complete, matching all added and removed tasks as well as the gateway type changes. The only (minor) deviation is the formatting of the gateway type changes: the LLM answer omits the extra space after the colon and before the type change for "Gateway_Payment" that is present in the ground truth (`Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel` vs `Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel`). The headings are also bolded and in markdown, where the ground truth is not, but the requirements do not prohibit this.

Given the utmost strictness required, this minor formatting difference should result in a point deduction, thus the score is 9.0.
