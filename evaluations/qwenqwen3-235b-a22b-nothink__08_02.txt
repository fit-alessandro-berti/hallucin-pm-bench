**Score: 9.0**

**Justification:**

The LLM answer is highly accurate, clearly stating that T5 can fire before T3, and providing the correct minimal firing sequence: T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5, which matches the ground truth. The explanation is logically sound, correctly describes token flow, and explicitly notes that T5 can fire before T3 becomes possible.

**Small errors/omissions:**
- The ground truth explicitly traces the markings after each transition (M₁, M₂, etc.), while the LLM does not, though it does concisely describe enabling.
- The LLM answer doesn't explicitly state that after T5 fires, T3 is permanently disabled, though it hints at this: "T5 fires before T3 becomes possible." The ground truth is more precise in stating "confirms that T5 can indeed precede T3".
- The wording “T5 fires directly without needing T3” could be clearer; the point is that firing T5 disables T3 by consuming the P2 token, not just that T3 hasn't occurred yet.

**Conclusion:**  
Only minor phrasing details separate the answers. The core sequence and logic are correct. Small omissions and less explicit explanation cost 1 point.
