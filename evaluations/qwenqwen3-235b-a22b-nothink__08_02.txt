The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" for Q1 and provides the accurate minimal firing sequence for Q2, matching the ground truth path. However, the explanation contains a significant factual error: T3 becomes enabled (possible) immediately after T1 (when P2 receives a token), not after T5. Stating "T5 fires before T3 becomes possible" misrepresents the net's behavior, contradicting the ground truth's accurate depiction of T3's enablement and subsequent disablement. The lack of intermediate markings for verification further reduces precision, though not strictly required. Under strict evaluation, these issues warrant a substantial deduction despite the core sequence being correct.
