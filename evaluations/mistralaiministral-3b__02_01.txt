7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match (3 distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). No deduction.
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in A-9321). No deduction.
- **Q3**: Exact match (earliest timestamp is "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00" from A-9321 Receive_Order). No deduction.
- **Q4**: Exact match (Quality_Check occurs twice: once for B-1045, once for C-77). No deduction.
- **Q5**: Major errors. Ground truth lists three activities that never start a case (Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Ship_Order), as first events are only Receive_Order (A-9321, B-1045) and Quality_Check (C-77). LLM list includes Receive_Order (incorrect, as it starts two cases) and only one correct item (Validate_Order), while missing Pack_Items and Ship_Order. This is a substantial inaccuracy (wrong count, inclusion of invalid item, omissions), warranting a heavy penalty under strict criteriaâ€”equivalent to ~3 points lost from a base of 10.

Overall: Perfect accuracy on 4/5 questions, but Q5's multiple errors (inclusion error + omissions) result in significant deduction, yielding 7.0. The JSON structure and format are correct, but content fidelity drives the score.
