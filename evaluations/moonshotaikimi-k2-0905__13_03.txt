7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact count (1) for question 1, matching the ground truth precisely.

For question 2, it concisely addresses the core issue of small sample size (14 events), single occurrence, contrast with automatic checks, extrapolation risks, and sampling error/under-over-representation, staying under 120 words. However, it omits key ground truth nuances: the drastic frequency swing (e.g., 0% to 7%), wide confidence intervals, string variations among automatic checks ("Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), strict vs. fuzzy matching pitfalls, and the need for a larger/random sample. These omissions reduce depth and completeness, warranting a deduction despite overall accuracy.
