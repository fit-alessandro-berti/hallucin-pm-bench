7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive), adhering to the required headings and ignoring non-structural elements like renamings (e.g., "Review Application" unchanged, "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan" ignored) or flow IDs. This earns strong marks for semantic accuracy (8/10 on content).

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Added/Removed tasks**: Lists only task IDs without including descriptive names (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"), which the ground truth explicitly provides as part of the summary. This omission reduces clarity and fidelity, deducting 1.5 points total (0.75 per section).
- **Gateway-type changes**: Accurately describes the shift but lacks ground truth details like "exclusive (XOR)" vs. "inclusive (OR)", versioning ("in *v1* to ... in *v2*"), and precise formatting (e.g., bolding, escaped underscore). Wording is close but not identical, deducting 1.0 point.
- **Formatting/Structure**: Uses inconsistent markdown (### headings, unnumbered bullets) vs. ground truth's bolded/italicized/numbered style and final confirmatory note. This introduces minor but noticeable differences, deducting 0.5 points.
- No extraneous errors (e.g., inventing changes), but the cumulative presentation gaps prevent a perfect score.

Total: Starts at 10, deducts 3.0 for strict adherence deviations = 7.0. Adjusted slightly upward to 7.5 for complete coverage of *all* changes without fabrications.
