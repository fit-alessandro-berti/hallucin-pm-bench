9.0

- The LLM answer gives the correct answers for all three questions, but it lacks minor required details/formatting:
    - For Q1, it simply outputs "3" rather than "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" or at least names the cases. The ground truth expects explicit mention of "C123, C456, C789".
    - Q2 and Q3 answers are spot-on.
- Given your strictness instructions, the missing case names in Q1 should cost a significant fraction of a point. Therefore, I deduct 1 point.
