1.0

The LLM answer incorrectly states "No" for Q1, directly contradicting the ground truth "Yes." It fails to recognize the alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) that enables T5 before T3, leaving a token in P2. The provided explanation is flawed and ignores this sequence, offering no valid demonstration or correct reasoning for impossibility. This major factual error, with no partial credit for structure, warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation.
