**2.0**

The LLM answer introduces multiple critical errors: (1) Invalid BPMN—boundary timer events cannot attach to sequence flows (f5/f6); they must attach to activities. (2) Fails SLA core requirement—escalates to new "End_Escalated" *without reaching* Task_Triage, violating "every claim must reach Triage Claim within 48h." (3) Unclear/vague "Timer Event on Start_Claim" (start events aren't modified this way; timing misaligns). (4) Adds excess new elements (new end event, multiple boundaries) vs. ground truth's minimal reuse. (5) No PT48H notation, no interrupting spec. Significant deviations warrant severe deduction despite brevity.
