The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" as the response and cites all relevant CaseIDs (C001-C004) with mostly accurate sequences, correctly pinpointing C002 and C004 as counterexamples to "always." However, significant deductions for:
- **Factual error** (major): For C004, incorrectly states "two activities ('Check_Fraud' and 'Pack_Items') between 'Receive_Order' and 'Validate_Payment'"—Pack_Items occurs *after* Validate_Payment (sequence is correct but "between" analysis is wrong, inflating count and misnaming intervener).
- **Format deviations**: Bullet-list prose vs. ground truth's structured table with ✅/❌ and precise notes; unnecessary Python code block wrapping the response, which deviates from the prompt's "1. Answer Yes or No. 2. Justify..." structure.
- **Minor issues**: Redundant repetition in Python; wordy phrasing (e.g., "activities other than 'Validate_Payment' between"); no table clarity.

Overall, core logic sound but flawed justification and extraneous output prevent higher score under strict criteria.
