- The LLM Answer correctly identifies both parallel task sets, and numbers them in order.  
- It lists only the tasks that can execute concurrently within the same parallel construct.
- However, the answer omits explicit mention that these are the only tasks in parallel and lacks the *labels* ("Set 1 – first parallel block," etc.) provided in the ground truth. Also, it uses parentheses rather than the explicit parallel notation (‖).  
- These are minor formatting omissions, but given the instruction for utmost strictness and that even small errors should reduce the score significantly, a full point is subtracted for missing the explicit labeling, parallel notation, and clarifying statement that no other tasks can run in parallel.
