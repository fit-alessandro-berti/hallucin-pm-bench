7.5  
The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets from Process B in the proper order, which aligns with the core requirement of the prompt and ground truth. However, under strict evaluation:  
- It lacks the descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**") and structural formatting (bold, backticks, ‖ symbol), introducing minor but noticeable presentation differences (-1.0).  
- It omits the concluding sentence ("No other tasks..."), which is present in the ground truth and provides completeness (-0.5).  
- Parentheses and comma separation deviate slightly from the ground truth's style, warranting a small deduction for not matching verbatim (-1.0).  
No factual errors, but these format/content omissions reduce the score from a potential 10.0.
