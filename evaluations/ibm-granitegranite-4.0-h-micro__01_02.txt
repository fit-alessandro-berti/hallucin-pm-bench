### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Decision Points (Partial Credit: ~6.0/10)
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three core decision points and uses the exact activity names from the prompt (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)"). It also accurately captures the ≤2 point difference threshold and the amount-based branching for < €15 000 (auto-approval) vs. ≥ €15 000 (escalation). However, under strict evaluation, there are notable differences from the ground truth:
- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: LLM omits the explicit escalation to the "Harmonisation Committee for tie-break" if scores differ by >2, and fails to note its position as a "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split." This is a critical omission of process flow and terminology.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: LLM vaguely states "requires further action" for ≥ €15 000, while ground truth specifies "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval." It also misses the contextual placement "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check," altering the perceived sequence.
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: LLM adds extraneous phrasing ("after the underwriter alignment and amount assessment"), which introduces imprecision not present in ground truth's concise "the board votes Approve or Reject." Minor formatting (e.g., bolding **Approve**/**Reject** in ground truth) is unmirrored.
These omissions and additions reduce precision, reflecting incomplete adherence to the "exact terminology and flow" emphasized in the prompt, warranting a significant deduction.

#### Required Documents (Partial Credit: ~7.0/10)
The LLM lists all six required documents accurately in terms of core names and matches the prompt's intent closely (e.g., "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet," "Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)"). No extraneous standard loan terminology is introduced. However, strict comparison to ground truth reveals small but penalizable differences:
- **Wording inconsistencies**: 
  - "Proof of Address (document ≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's concise "(≤ 3 months)" – adds unnecessary "document" and "old."
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" – includes "single" and "or" (matching prompt but diverging from ground truth's shortened slash format).
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" – retains "template" from prompt, which ground truth omits for brevity.
- **Omission**: Ground truth includes a clarifying note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), emphasizing the non-standard nature; LLM ignores this, missing an opportunity to reinforce the process's uniqueness.
- **Formatting**: Ground truth uses numbered list with full titles (e.g., including "Latest Income Statement"); LLM uses bullets and slight variations, which are minor but contribute to non-exact matching.
These are small errors, but per instructions, they incur significant point loss for not fully aligning.

#### Overall Assessment
The LLM answer is structurally sound and covers ~80% of the ground truth content without major inventions, but precision suffers from key omissions in decision logic/flow and minor document phrasing discrepancies. No criminal or off-policy issues arise, but strictness demands docking for fidelity to the benchmark. Total score balances the strengths against these gaps.
