1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Vocabulary mandate violations**: Uses forbidden terms like "Payment Clerk" and "Compliance Officer" (e.g., in Task 6), instead of mandated "Transaction Analyst" and "Regulatory Liaison". Introduces extraneous roles "Customer" and "Beneficiary" not present in ground truth or mandated.
- **Roles mismatch**: Includes incorrect/unmandated columns (Payment Clerk, Customer, Beneficiary) and omits "Operations Manager"; ground truth has exactly Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support.
- **Task descriptions**: Inaccurate mappings and wording (e.g., Task 1 adds "Log"; Task 4 adds "Flag &"; Task 5 combines unrelated actions; Task 6 uses wrong term and adds notification not in ground truth's "Archive Record"). Fails to bold "KYC Review" or emphasize mandated wording as in ground truth header.
- **RACI assignments**: Nearly all entries differ entirely (e.g., Task 1: LLM assigns R to wrong role vs. ground truth's R to Transaction Analyst/A to Operations Manager; Task 3: LLM has R to Transaction Analyst/A to Regulatory Liaison vs. ground truth's C to Transaction Analyst/R to Regulatory Liaison/A to Operations Manager).
- **Structure and extras**: Adds unnecessary legend and explanation; table header lacks ground truth's "(mandated wording)" phrasing; overall omissions/substitutions fail to "map every step...without omissions or substitutions."
