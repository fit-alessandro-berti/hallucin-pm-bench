2.5

- **Vocabulary Compliance:** The LLM answer often ignores the "mandate" on enforced vocabulary. For example, it lists "Payment Clerk" as a role, which is explicitly prohibited; it should have been "Transaction Analyst". It does not always use the required activity names (e.g., the activity column is inconsistent and includes non-mandated names).
- **Extra/Incorrect Columns:** It adds roles not mentioned or requested in the prompt or ground truth, such as "Customer" and "Beneficiary" (which are not actors in the process per prompt).
- **Activity Names:** Several listed activities do not match the enforced lexicon, such as "Receive & Log Payment Instruction" or "Screen Payment Against Sanctions List" (should use strictly the mandated naming conventions provided).
- **Mapping Logic:** The accountable roles often diverge from the model answer, and the distribution of R, A, C, I is not accurate. For example, KYC Review has Transaction Analyst as Responsible while it should be Regulatory Liaison, and Accountable is given to Regulatory Liaison rather than Operations Manager. 
- **Role Omission:** Omits "Operations Manager" as a column, which is present in the ground truth.
- **Formatting:** The instruction specifically requests markdown and strict conformity with the terminology and mapping shown in the ground truth.
- **Inclusion of Extra Steps:** Some steps, like "Notify Compliance Officer", are presented, which is not a mandated activity nor a role per the forced lexicon.

**Conclusion:** There is foundational non-compliance with the vocabulary mandate, omissions, erroneous role mapping, and deviation from structure. Only a base-level understanding of RACI is retained. Due to serious terminological and structural errors, a 2.5 is warranted.
