3.0

The LLM answer includes two correct parallel pairs from Process B but erroneously adds a third pair ("Book_Courier â€” Pack_Items") from the explicitly ignored Process A, violating the core instruction to refer only to Process B. This critical confusion of processes introduces a major factual error, and the list is incomplete in accuracy despite matching format and partial sorting. Strict evaluation deducts heavily for such hallucination and disregard of constraints, leaving only partial credit for the valid pairs.
