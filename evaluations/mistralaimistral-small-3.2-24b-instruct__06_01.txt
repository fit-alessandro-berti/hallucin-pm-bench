The LLM answer presents three pairs:
- Book_Courier — Pack_Items
- Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
- Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

The main issues:
- **Book_Courier — Pack_Items** is incorrectly included; these tasks belong to Process A, not Process B. This demonstrates a significant error concerning the fundamental instruction to only consider Process B.
- The other two pairs, Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines, are correct and match the ground truth.
- Pairs are correctly alphabetized within pairs and as a list.

Due to the critical error of including a pair from the wrong process, which violates the explicit instruction, the answer loses the vast majority of its points. Since all truly required pairs are included and formatted correctly, it does not score as a total failure.

Strict assessment: Major deduction for misreading tasks (“Book_Courier” and “Pack_Items”), but partial credit because the two correct pairs are also provided with proper formatting.

**Final score: 2.0**
