9.5

The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all rule statuses (Compliant for R1/R6, Violated for R2/R3/R5, Not Applicable for R4) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are accurate, â‰¤20 words, and factually correct, with minor differences: R2 omits explicit dates but correctly ties violation to pre-reapproval shipping; R5 omits Pay_Invoice mention but covers key processing steps. No factual errors, but slight incompleteness deducts 0.5 for strictness.
