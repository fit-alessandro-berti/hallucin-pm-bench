9.0

Rationale for the grade:

- R1: CORRECT — Marked compliant, concise/accurate explanation.
- R2: ALMOST CORRECT — Correctly marked as violated and mentions re-approval and premature shipping, but the justification focuses more on the sequence (occurred before re-approval) than explicit lateness after approval ("violating... two-day-after-last-approval rule" is a minor misunderstanding: the real issue is that the two-day clock starts after the new approval, which hasn't happened yet). The reasoning captures the error, but not with full clarity; deduct a small point for precision.
- R3: CORRECT — Correct, matches ground truth.
- R4: CORRECT — Not applicable, matches ground truth.
- R5: CORRECT — Accurate violation explanation.
- R6: CORRECT — Compliant, correct justification.
- Overall result correct.

Small points lost for the slightly imprecise justification on R2, but the answer is strictly formatted, all calls are right, and overall the answer closely matches the ground truth.
