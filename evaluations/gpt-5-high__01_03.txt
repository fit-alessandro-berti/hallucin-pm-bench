9.0

a) The LLM answer correctly identifies both the main conditional branch and the TriVote gate, concisely summarizes each rule in one sentence, correctly specifies the participation of the Sustainability Officer, and accurately describes the “two out of three approvals” rule.

b) The LLM answer lists all required documents in the correct order of first appearance.

Minor point loss: In the a) section, the LLM redundantly says "otherwise it fails" at the end of the TriVote bullet—strictly the process moves to the next step or stops, but “fail” isn’t quite as precisely matched in tone to the ground truth. In b), the LLM adds a minor ambiguous element by separating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" and "Offer Sheet 77" (could potentially be implied as two forms), but since both are listed, and the order matches, this is a negligible issue.

Otherwise, the answer is highly faithful and complete with no major errors or hallucinations.

Thus, 9.0.
