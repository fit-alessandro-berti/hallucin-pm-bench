4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology Compliance (Perfect Match: +3.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization and no instances of forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). Activities list matches ground truth without extras.
- **Structure and Format (Partial Match: +1.0 point)**: Basic table structure is present with activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. However, headers use abbreviations (e.g., "AM (Account Manager)") instead of full names (e.g., "Account Manager"), which introduces unwarranted shorthand. Extra introductory text explains RACI abbreviations, which is not in the ground truth and qualifies as unwarranted content. Formatting lacks bolding for key R/A and R entries as in ground truth. Blanks in cells are used instead of explicit "C", "I", etc., making it incomplete.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Mismatches: -7.0 points, strict deduction)**: Significant deviations from ground truth, violating the narrative reflection and "exactly one Responsible" rule in several cases. Key errors include:
  - **Receive Application**: Only AM R/A; missing CO C, FC I, IT I (incomplete; -0.5).
  - **KYC Review**: AM I (should be A), CO R/A (should be R; over-assigns accountability), missing FC C and IT I (incomplete; wrong Responsible/Accountable split; -1.5).
  - **Order Vetting**: Only AM R/A; missing CO C, FC I, IT I (incomplete; -0.5).
  - **Payment Clearance**: FC R/A (should be R; over-assigns), IT I correct but missing AM A and CO C (incomplete Responsible/Accountable; -1.5).
  - **Record Update**: AM I (should be C), IT R/A (should be R; over-assigns), missing CO I and FC C (incomplete; wrong assignments; -1.5).
  - **Notify Customer**: Only AM R/A; missing CO I, FC I, IT I (incomplete; -1.5).
  Overall, the matrix is sparsely populated (many blanks where ground truth specifies C/I), fails to ensure single Responsible per activity consistently, and misassigns Accountable roles (e.g., CO as A instead of R for KYC Review). These are not small errors but fundamental inaccuracies in RACI logic, leading to severe point loss under strict criteria. Self-awareness N/A as noted.
