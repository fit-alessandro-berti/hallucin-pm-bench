2.5

The LLM answer makes a change that is allowed by the rules (reducing the `camunda:dueDate` of an existing `<userTask>` element), but the change is NOT the expected one per the ground truth, and demonstrates a significant misunderstanding of the SLA context:

- The LLM changes the due date for **Prepare Contract** from P2D to P1D, while ground truth changes **Collect Equipment** from P5D to P2D.
- The rationale provided by the LLM is incorrect: Aligning "Prepare Contract" to the "Sign Contract" SLA (3 days) does not make sense because "Prepare Contract" is set to 2 days, and "Sign Contract" is already at three; this does not address overall SLA compliance or cycle time.
- The correct compliance fix, as in the ground truth, is to reduce the excessive 5-day due date on "Collect Equipment", as this is what currently allows the process as modelled to breach the contractual 3-day onboarding timeframe.

Despite a well-formed diff and adherence to the restriction of 'one modification' to an existing task attribute, the answer is incorrect for the scenario, and the rationale is not valid. Because the diff format and scope are correct, but the specific fix and business understanding are wrong, this warrants a low but not minimal score: 2.5/10.
