The LLM answer proposes an entirely different modification (changing `Task_PrepareContract` dueDate to P1D) compared to the ground truth (changing `Task_CollectEquipment` dueDate to P2D), with a mismatched rationale that incorrectly assumes alignment needs for sequential tasks rather than addressing an overall 3-day SLA; additionally, the diff format includes unnecessary line numbers and XML context lines not matching the ground truth's minimal single-hunk style, resulting in major deviations despite adhering to the general output structure.
