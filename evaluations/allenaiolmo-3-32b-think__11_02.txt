**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (driving score up)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), backed by table data (wait times, processing times, rework %, SLA breaches). Explanations strictly from table (e.g., 150 min wait/22% rework; 25 min process/stdev 9/12.4% SLA; 18 min wait/3.2% SLA). Memo format concise (149 words <200), professional, no hallucinations or absent activities.
- **Weaknesses/Deductions (significant per strictness rule)**:
  - **Recommendations**: Major gap—each is compound ("automate... *and* increase staffing"; "protocols *and* training"; "prioritization *and* resources"), violating "one concrete" rule (-1.2 pts). Less data-driven/specific than ground truth (e.g., vague "automate validation" vs. "automatic same-day digital... with validation"; no metrics/projections like "halve rework" or "lift throughput 10%") (-0.6 pts).
  - **Explanations**: Minor inaccuracies/loose links, e.g., Initial_Assessment ties 3.2% SLA breaches directly to "delays in initiating" (wait time), but SLA is explicitly *processing time* breaches (12 min avg/stdev 4); ignores upstream role/throughput drop (-0.7 pts). Misses key ground truth emphases like throughput drops (190 cases/day) and queue (30 min for Review) (-0.3 pts).
  - **Overall fidelity**: Captures essence but lacks ground truth's precision, impact projections, bolded metrics, and bottleneck flow analysis (-0.0 further, as core met but not identically).

Total deductions from 10.0 yield 8.2. Very good but not exemplary under utmost strictness.
