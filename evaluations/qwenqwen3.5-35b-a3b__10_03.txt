**2.1**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth):
- **Vocabulary Compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses all 4 mandated terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring"). No disallowed synonyms leak in. However, added unauthorized activity names ("Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Analyst Notification") violate "do not rename, merge, or add activities."
- **Activities List (-3.5)**: LLM lists 8 activities vs. GT's 6. Adds/splits extras ("Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Analyst Notification") not matching narrative or GT ("Release Funds" in GT consolidates). "Compliance Officer Approval" matches, but extras are invalid additions/merges.
- **RACI Assignments (-2.8)**: Near-total mismatch. E.g.:
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | LLM: Front R/A only; GT: Front **R,A**, Compliance C, Treasury I. |
  | KYC Review | LLM: Compliance R/A only; GT: Compliance **R,A**, Compliance Officer C, Treasury I. |
  | AML Screening | LLM: Compliance R only; GT: Compliance **R,A**, Officer C, Treasury I. |
  | Risk Scoring | LLM: Compliance R, Officer C; GT: Front C, Compliance R, Officer **A**, Treasury I. |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | LLM: Officer R/A only; GT: Front I, Compliance C, Officer **R,A**. |
  | Others | LLM invents non-GT activities with wrong/sparse assignments; GT uses distributed C/I/– . |
- **Table Format (-1.5)**: No bolding (**R, A**), uses "R/A" instead of "R, A"; no dashes (–) for no involvement; plain cells vs. GT styling. Headers differ (e.g., GT longer Activity header).
- **Output Structure (-1.1)**: Massive chain-of-thought pollution (reasoning, plans, "Wait," notes) before/around table violates "Return the matrix as a Markdown table" – not clean output. Legend/Key mismatches GT's style.
- **Overall Fidelity**: ~20-25% alignment (only 4 activities + vocab correct); violates "every activity and role described" by inventing/splitting. Strict penalty for all discrepancies yields low score.
