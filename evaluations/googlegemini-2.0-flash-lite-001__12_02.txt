The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" as the response and provides a valid counter-example from case C003 (lines 6-7), which alone disproves the "always follows" claim by showing reversed order. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits the additional counter-example in case C005 (lines 11-12), where Validate_Payment occurs without any prior Receive_Order, which the ground truth explicitly highlights as a key instance. The justification is concise but lacks the ground truth's fuller structure, phrasing (e.g., "clear counter-examples" and conclusive proof statement), and comprehensive coverage of all relevant cases in the log, resulting in a partial match despite logical sufficiency.
