6.5

The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and cites case C003 (lines 6 and 7) where *Validate_Payment* precedes *Receive_Order*. This is the most obvious counterexample in the log and is clearly stated. 

However, the answer fails to mention case C005 (lines 11 and 12), where *Validate_Payment* appears but *Receive_Order* does not appear at all. This omission is significant, as the gold-standard specifically references this second counterexample and the instruction requests utmost strictness with point deductions for omissions. 

Although the answer meets the strict single-sentence requirement and is factual for the example given, the lack of completeness (not citing all clear counterexamples) means it cannot receive a high score.
