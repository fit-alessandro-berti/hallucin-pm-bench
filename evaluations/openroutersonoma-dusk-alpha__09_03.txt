The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and precision: both concisely explain the impossibility in one short paragraph due to the redacted event log lacking any rows or timestamps (essential for cycle time via complete_time - start_time differences), explicitly avoid computation or external guesses, and highlight the absence of supplementary data. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "dispersion" vs. explicit standard deviation/95% CI) do not introduce errors or deviations from the task's requirements.
