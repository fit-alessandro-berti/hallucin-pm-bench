9.0

The LLM answer is strongly aligned with the ground truth, concisely and accurately stating why none of the cycle time metrics (average, standard deviation, confidence interval) can be computed due to the absence of all data rows and timestamp values in Artefact A. Both answers explain the necessity of concrete log entries for calculation.

However, the LLM response introduces a slightly more elaborate phrase (“it is impossible to calculate cycle times…”) and describes in more detail the log’s limitations, including mention of the SLA catalogue (which isn't misleading, but is somewhat superfluous). While not factually wrong, this slightly increased verbosity and inclusion of the catalogue, which is not strictly necessary for the minimal task, departs from the absolute brevity and sufficiency of the ground truth answer.

This small deviation and very mild verbosity merits a 1-point deduction according to strict grading, resulting in a score of 9.0.
