**2.0**

The LLM answer proposes a fundamentally flawed solution compared to the ground truth. Key differences with severe errors:

- **Wrong attachment point**: Timer on `Task_Triage` (monitors Triage duration after reaching it) vs. ground truth's `Task_Receive` (attempts to enforce from early process). Fails SLA ("reach Triage within 48h"); doesn't trigger if Triage not started.
- **Missing specifics**: No `id="Timer_48h"`, no `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`, no explicit new `sequenceFlow` from timer to `Task_Triage`.
- **Invented non-standard BPMN**: "activationGroup" attribute doesn't exist in BPMN 2.0.
- **Vague escalation**: No clear bypass mechanism or XML details; doesn't explain skipping docs like ground truth.
- **Semantic failure**: Won't auto-escalate if delayed before Triage.

Partial credit for timer idea, interrupting boundary mention, ID reference, and brevity (~90 words), but strict criteria demand near-exact match—major deviations justify low score.
