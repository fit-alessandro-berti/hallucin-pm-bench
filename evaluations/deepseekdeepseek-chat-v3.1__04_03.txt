10.0

The LLM answer is essentially identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and accuracy: it correctly identifies "No" compliance, references each rule individually (satisfied where appropriate, violated for rule 3 due to NA before RA), and concludes non-compliance based on the violation. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., bullet points vs. table; implicit vs. explicit "once each" for rule 1) do not constitute errors, as the prompt requires only a short justification referencing rules, which is fully met without factual deviation.
