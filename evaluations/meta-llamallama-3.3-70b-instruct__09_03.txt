The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of computation due to redacted data in Artefact A, specifies the lack of timestamps and event rows as the precise reason (aligning with the task's requirement for a short explanatory paragraph), and explicitly addresses all three requested metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval) without guessing or using external knowledge. It is accurate, follows plain text format, and remains within one paragraph. Minor deductions for slight verbosity compared to the ground truth's more concise phrasing (e.g., unnecessary introductory "typically need" clause and brief mention of Artefact B's irrelevance, which is true but not essential) and for not explicitly stating "impossible" or the exact need for "additional raw log entries," though these do not introduce errors.
