7.0

**Evaluation (Scoring rationale and detailed error identification):**

A. **Decision points (a)**

- The LLM correctly identifies two key decision points:
    1. The conditional branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check (risk outcome + loan amount → skip or proceed to manual underwriting)
    2. The TriVote gate (any two of three approvals).
- The rule wording is accurate, and the logic matches the ground truth. 
- However, the answer contains an overly verbose explanation under TriVote, which could obfuscate the core rule and is less succinct than the ground truth; still, no factual errors on rules themselves.

B. **Documents listed in order of first appearance (b)**

- **The LLM output contains two notable flaws:**
    1. It includes “Deck Officer role is assigned here, but the *document itself* is not named externally apart from users needing to fill it out.”  
        - This is extraneous/irrelevant: “Deck Officer” is a role assignment, not a required document. It should not appear in the document list.
    2. **Signed Offer Sheet 77** is missing as a distinct entry; the LLM only lists “Offer Sheet 77” and “ID Matrix Declaration” for step 8, but omits that the signed version of Offer Sheet 77 is required at this point. This constitutes a significant omission, as “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is specified distinctly in both the process description and the ground truth list.
- The remainder of the documents, including their order (Form 14B, Scorecards, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025), are otherwise correct.

**Penalty breakdown:**
- Strict adherence demanded, so:
    - Missing “Signed Offer Sheet 77” entry: **–2 points**
    - Insertion of non-document (“Deck Officer role”): **–1 point**
- Style issues/verbosity do not count as full-point errors due to no misstatement of rule.

**No hallucinated (extraneous) document types** are present (e.g., KYC/AML), which is good.

**Final score: 7.0/10**  
— Two substantial errors in the document list prevent a score in the 8–10 range; decision points are correct but lack conciseness.
