4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, prioritizing exactness in content, structure, phrasing, and completeness. Part (a) earns partial credit for identifying the two decision points with mostly accurate rules, but loses points for unnecessary additions (e.g., the parenthetical explanation on participation vs. approval, which introduces extra interpretation not in the ground truth and exceeds the "one sentence each" requirement), minor phrasing differences (e.g., not specifying "otherwise it proceeds to that review" or using "record 'Approve'"), and an introductory definition that deviates from the concise format. Part (b) incurs major deductions: it hallucinates/invents a non-document (#2, "Deck Officer" role treated as a document, shifting the entire order); lists scorecards in positions 3–5 instead of 2–4; omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (mentioned only parenthetically, not listed separately); and adds extraneous commentary (e.g., "preparing this implies it exists"). The list is fundamentally inaccurate and incomplete despite superficial similarity. No hallucinations on excluded topics (e.g., KYC), but overall fidelity is low, warranting a score below 5.0.
