7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core BPMN process logic faithfully, matching the textual description without inventing steps (e.g., no escalations or approvals). The flow structure (classification, parallel logging/response, event-based wait with timeout, closure paths, and terminate end) aligns closely with the ground truth semantically. Both use 18 elements and 19 flows with equivalent connections and conditions ("simple"/"complex"). The event-based gateway for the 24-hour wait/reply/reminder is modeled correctly in both, using appropriate BPMN constructs (catch events and timer).

However, under utmost strictness, several differences result in point deductions for mismatches against the ground truth:
- **JSON structure (significant deduction: -1.5)**: No top-level "process_id". Flows use "sourceRef"/"targetRef"/"id"/"conditionExpression" instead of "source"/"target"/"condition" (no IDs). Elements lack GT-specific keys like "event" for catch events (LLM uses subtype types like "intermediateMessageCatchEvent" instead of generic "intermediateCatchEvent" with "event": "message"/"timer").
- **Element names and details (moderate deduction: -1.0)**: ~7 name mismatches (e.g., start: "Support Email Received" vs. "Email Received"; parse/create task: LLM adds "Parse Email &" for faithfulness, but GT omits parsing as a separate task/name; gateways: "Classification Decision" vs. "Simple or Complex?", "Parallel Split" vs. "Fork Log/Wait", etc.; timer: "24h Timeout" vs. "Timer 24h"; ends: "Process End"/"Terminated" vs. "End"/"Terminate"). IDs also differ entirely.
- **Cancel modeling (moderate deduction: -0.5)**: Both inadequately integrate the "at any point" interruption (unreachable catch event), but LLM adds invalid/hallucinated keys ("attachedToRef" to a gateway, which can't host boundaries; "cancel": true), diverging from GT's simpler (though flawed) standalone catch event.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 7.0 for cumulative differences, but no major logical errors or hallucinations.
