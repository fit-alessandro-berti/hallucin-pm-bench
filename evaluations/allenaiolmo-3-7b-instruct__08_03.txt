**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies **yes** and the key shortcut via T2b enabling T5 without prior T3, providing the minimal 4-step sequence to fire T5 (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5) where T3 has not fired. The net reconstruction and path analysis are accurate, with good coverage of routes.

However, under strict comparison to ground truth:
- **Major difference in sequence**: LLM gives 4-step sequence ending at T5 (correct for enabling T5 pre-T3 but incomplete for demonstrating "T5 before T3" where both fire); ground truth gives 6-step **〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉** as shortest proving the order, using T6 feedback to enable/fire T3 *after* T5.
- **Conceptual gap/misstatement**: LLM claims "T3 never fires" or "may never," missing/undervaluing T6's role in re-enabling pc for T3 post-T5 (as emphasized in ground truth). This treats "before T3" as vacuous if T3 skips, but ground truth shows strict ordering with both events.
- **Missing elements**: No markings, no "why this works" via shortcut+feedback, no proof of minimality including loop (lower bound 4 + extra 2).
- **Excess rambling**: Lengthy, repetitive analysis with backtracking (e.g., initial confusion, then correction), diluting conciseness vs. ground truth's tight structure.

Strictness deducts heavily for sequence mismatch (~2 points), missed feedback explanation (~1 point), despite core insight matching. Not 10 (exact match needed); not <5 (fundamentals right, no wrong answer).
