The LLM answer proposes a fundamentally different and more complex solution (event-based gateway post-Start_Claim, multiple message/timer events, post-Triage throw) that introduces elements not in the ground truth (e.g., gateway, message events, implied signal path) and fails to ensure the process reaches Task_Triage within 48h by bypassing delaysâ€”instead, it monitors and separately escalates without reusing flows to force progression. It references fewer IDs, adds unnecessary components beyond minimal events/flows, and risks non-compliance with SLA by not guaranteeing Triage arrival. Major deviations in structure, functionality, and simplicity warrant severe deduction.
