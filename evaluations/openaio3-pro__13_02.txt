9.3

**Evaluation:**

1. **Question 1:**  
   - Correct. States: "1 occurrence (case C05)"  
   - Ground truth: **1**  
   - FULL MARKS.

2. **Question 2:**  
   a) "1 / 48 = 2.08 %"  
      - Correct: **2.08 %**  
   b) "1 / 12 = 8.33 %"  
      - Correct: **8.33 %**  
   - FULL MARKS.

3. **Question 3 - Explanation:**  
   - Wording is different, but:
     - (i) **Mentions the single occurrence** (calls it "only one occurrence" and "single-case").
     - (ii) **Notes statistical problems**: "negligible support," "swey averages," "making the process look more complex," "overfit," "noise," "reducing accuracy."
     - (iii) **Warns about generalisation** ("generalising... can misrepresent typical behaviour").
   - The points about overfitting, variant inflation, and misrepresentation are valid and correctly illustrative.
   - Does not specifically mention "confidence intervals" or "collapse to 0%" as in the reference, but the variance/instability and unreliability are strongly implied by "unduly sway averages," "overfit," and "noise."

**Small deductions:**  
- The explanation, while excellent and accurate, does not directly state the issue about the "confidence intervals" or the possibility of no occurrences in the future slices, as the reference does, but covers the core interpretive risks.  
- Wording is slightly less explicit about statistical uncertainty.

**Hence, a small deduction (~0.7) is warranted for minor omission of those explicit variance/statistical language elements.**

**Final score: 9.3**
