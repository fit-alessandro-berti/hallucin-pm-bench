10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly, including calculations rounded to two decimals. For question 3, the response (97 words) adheres to constraints, explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue (negligible support), highlights instability/variance (skewing averages, overfitting to noise, inflating variants), and cautions against over-generalization (misrepresents typical behavior, reduces accuracy in full log). No inventions or deviations from the log; it meets all specified criteria without errors.
