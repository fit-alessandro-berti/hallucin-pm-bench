The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) matching the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3 via the alternative path while preserving the P2 token. The brief explanation accurately traces token flow and preconditions without errors. Minor deductions for lacking explicit markings (e.g., M₁ = {P1, P2}) and the post-firing detail on T3 disablement, which add confirmatory depth in the ground truth; however, the core demonstration is precise and within word limit.
