The LLM answer is factually perfect, identifies the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7, C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), cites identical line numbers and case-IDs, correctly structures as "No" followed by one concise paragraph per the prompt, and fully disproves the claim with precise log-based justification matching the ground truth in substance, evidence, and logic. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "inaccurate" vs. "false", paragraph vs. bulleted format, "without any preceding" vs. "never contains at all") are stylistic and do not alter meaning, introduce errors, or deviate from the log.
