3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (Major Deduction: -5.0 points)**: The core task is to identify and rank the **three worst activities strictly by average waiting time** (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h). The LLM correctly identifies #1 (Request_Documents) with accurate waiting times (36.5h avg, 120.0h p95). It partially corrects #3 (Send_Closure_Letter, which is actually #2, with accurate 12.2h avg, 44.0h p95) but inserts **Initial_Screening (2.1h avg)** as #2, which is not in the top 3 (it's fourth-worst). This is a fundamental error in analysis, directly violating the prompt's ranking requirement and diverging from the ground truth's exact top 3. Waiting times are quoted verbatim where correct, but the wrong activity invalidates the set.
  
- **No Unwarranted Content (Deduction: -1.0 points)**: The response avoids service times, throughput, or unlisted activities but includes irrelevant comparisons (e.g., "320% longer than Submit_Claim" for Initial_Screening) and extraneous text (e.g., "57% above缄默 band" – apparent gibberish/typo; "*cgi" at end). This adds non-memo fluff not in the ground truth.

- **Action Relevance (Partial Credit but Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Actions are concrete and promise ≥20% reduction (e.g., #1's e-upload for Request_Documents is logical and data-plausible; #3's e-delivery for Send_Closure_Letter aligns thematically with ground truth's e-signature idea). However, the action for the wrong #2 activity (Initial_Screening) is irrelevant to the top 3. Ground truth actions are specific examples; LLM's are invented but somewhat tied to waiting issues without fabricating table data. Still, mismatch on activities undermines this.

- **Format and Constraints (Minor Credit)**: Memo structure is crisp, under 150 words (~100 words), executive-toned, and focused on waiting times only. But it deviates from ground truth's concise list format and includes casual phrasing ("drowning customers in wait") not in the prompt or ground truth.

Overall, the response captures the memo intent and partial accuracy (one fully correct activity, numbers where used) but fails critically on the prompt's strict ranking/analysis, warranting a low strict score. Small issues (typos, comparisons) compound the loss.
