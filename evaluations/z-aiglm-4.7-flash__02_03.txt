The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, correctness, and conciseness. Minor formatting variations (e.g., "**1.**" vs. "**A1:**", "3 (cases: ...)" vs. "3 cases (...)", absence of escaping backslash in "Pack_Items") do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they preserve meaning, match the log's attribute values exactly, and adhere to "bullet-point answers only." All facts verified correct against the log.
