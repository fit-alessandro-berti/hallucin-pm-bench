The LLM answer correctly identifies and enumerates all three sets of concurrent tasks exactly as in the ground truth, with identical task names, ordering, and comma separations. The minor deduction is for the added introductory and concluding sentences, which introduce extraneous text beyond the strictly specified format of "numbered lines" only, violating the prompt's instruction to return just that structure. No other errors, such as including sequential tasks or tasks from other processes, are present.
