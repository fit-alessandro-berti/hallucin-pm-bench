7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of core conclusion**: The LLM correctly concludes "Yes" with a valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) and basic justification matching the ground truth's enabling conditions (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0). This aligns well with the prompt's requirements. (+3.0)
- **Sequence accuracy**: The provided sequence reaches the same marking as in the ground truth (p2=1, p3=1 before T5 fires), enabling T5 before T3. No errors in token flows. (+2.5)
- **Justification quality**: Basic explanation of inhibitor arc and conditions is present and accurate, but it lacks the ground truth's deeper insight that T5 *must* fire before T3 to ever fire at all (due to permanent inhibition after T3). The LLM's justification is incomplete, stopping short of explaining post-T3 disablement or full process implications. (-1.0)
- **Structure and clarity**: Significant deduction for the convoluted presentation—starting with an incorrect "No" and impossibility proof, then self-correcting mid-response. This creates confusion and poor readability, deviating from the ground truth's clean, direct format. Even minor stylistic flaws (e.g., rambling reasoning) warrant loss under strict criteria. (-1.0)
- **Completeness**: Misses the extended sequence (including T3 and T4 after T5) and the "indeed must" nuance, reducing fidelity to the ground truth. No extraneous errors, but not exhaustive. (+0.0 net)

Overall, the answer is functionally correct but undermined by confusion, incompleteness, and lack of precision, justifying a solid but not top-tier score.
