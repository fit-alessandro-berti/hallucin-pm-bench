**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance**: Perfect (10/10). Uses exact terms "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring" with no leaks or synonyms.
- **Activities**: Major violation (-8 points total). Prompt forbids adding/renaming/merging activities. LLM adds 4 unauthorized rows ("Approval", "Scheduling payment", "Releasing funds", "Notifying originating analyst"); renames GT's "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". Core 4 activities present but insufficient—must match described process exactly without extras.
- **RACI assignments**: Extensive mismatches (-5 points). E.g.:
  | Activity | Key Differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Missing Treasury I; Compliance I (vs. GT C). |
  | KYC Review | Missing Officer C, Treasury I; Front-Office empty (GT –). |
  | AML Screening | Same as KYC. |
  | Risk Scoring | Compliance R,A (wrong; GT: Compliance R only, Officer **A**, Front C, Treasury I). |
  | Extras | All invalid. |
- **Formatting**: Poor (-2 points). No bolds on activities/R,A; empty cells (vs. GT –); incomplete role coverage (many blanks).
- **Completeness/Coverage**: Fails "every activity and role described" by inventing content; ignores escalation logic (e.g., Officer role in Risk Scoring/Approval).
- **Overall**: ~20% alignment with GT (vocab + partial core activities); heavy deductions for strict rule breaks yield 2.0.
