4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (strong match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. This adheres perfectly to the policy.
- **Structure and Content (partial match, +1.5 points)**: The matrix format is present with the correct activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are added. Headers include role abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), which match the prompt's role listing but differ from the ground truth's full names only (minor inconsistency, but not a major error). Introduction text ("Certainly! Below is...") and legend are unwarranted additions compared to the ground truth's clean table presentation (-0.5 deduction).
- **RACI Allocations (major deficiencies, -4.0 points)**: The Responsible (R) assignments align with the process narrative and ground truth for each activity (e.g., AM for Receive Application and Order Vetting; CO for KYC Review). However, the LLM omits all Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) designations, resulting in an incomplete RACI matrix. The ground truth distributes these across roles (e.g., AM as A in multiple steps; widespread C/I for CO, FC, IT). The legend's "blank = No involvement" misrepresents RACI principles, implying no consultation or information flow, which contradicts the ground truth's detailed allocations. Each activity in the ground truth has exactly one R (with AM often A), but the LLM simplifies to R-only, ignoring the "Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate" expectation from the notes.
- **Formatting and Presentation (minor issues, -0.5 points)**: No bolding on key elements (e.g., **KYC Review**, **R / A** in ground truth). Blanks are used instead of explicit letters (e.g., no "C" or "I"). The table is readable but lacks the ground truth's emphasis and precision.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Under utmost strictness, the incomplete RACI (missing ~70% of designations) is a critical flaw, as it fails to "reflect the narrative" fully. Small errors (e.g., extra text, no bolding, header abbreviations) compound this. Baseline for partial correctness is 5.0, reduced for gaps.
