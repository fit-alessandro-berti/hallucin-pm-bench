3.5

- **Terminology**: The LLM answer correctly uses *KYC Review*, *Order Vetting*, and *Payment Clearance*, as required.
- **Matrix Structure**: Activities and role labels are correct, and no extra elements are introduced.
- **Severe Issues**:
  - **Missing RACI Roles**: The LLM matrix shows only "R" (Responsible), omitting Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I), which are present in the ground truth and are standard for a RACI matrix. This is a major omission.
  - **Incorrect Responsibility Assignments**: According to the process, some activities should have other roles marked as C, I, or A, but those are not reflected. For example, Account Manager should be "R/A" for several steps but is marked only "R". Consulted and Informed roles (e.g., C for Compliance in multiple steps, I for IT and others) are completely missing. This shows a lack of detail and process understanding.
- **Legend Error**: The legend only explains “R” and ignores other RACI codes (even though only “R” is used).

**Summary**: Accurate on forbidden and required terminology, but the matrix fails at a fundamental RACI requirement (including all role types), and the allocations are incomplete compared to the ground truth. Severe reduction for missing roles and incomplete assignment.

**Score: 3.5**
