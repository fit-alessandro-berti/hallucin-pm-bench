**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Correct core answer (Yes, with sequence T1→T2→T5)**: Partial credit (+3.0). Identifies the key reachable sequence where T5 fires before T3.
- **Major errors in Petri net semantics (-3.5)**:
  - Misdescribes T5 firing: Claims "p6 is consumed" (wrong; p6 is *produced*). Says "p4 becomes 0" or "p4 drops to 0 due to T5 consuming it" (wrong; inhibitor arc neither consumes/produces from p4, which stays 0).
  - No mention of p3 consumption (T5 removes token from p3 → p3=0 post-T5).
  - Invented arcs ("p4→p6", "transition compasses p4").
- **Incomplete/inaccurate states (-1.5)**: States stop prematurely; no full markings (e.g., omits p3=0, p6=1 after T5); doesn't show T3 firing post-T5.
- **Weak/missing justification (-0.8)**: No enabling condition (p3≥1 ∧ p4=0); no explanation of inhibitor or why possible (vs. ground truth's precise proof T5 *must* precede T3).
- **Minor issues (-0.5)**: Vague "→ ..." (not concrete full sequence); typos/confusing phrasing ("p3’s value + p4(0) via the inhibitor arc").

Total reflects ~42% alignment: basic idea right, but semantics/state errors make it unreliable/wrong in details. Ground truth is precise, complete, insightful.
