The LLM answer is semantically perfect: it correctly identifies all added tasks (3), removed tasks (1), and gateway changes (2), using exact IDs, names, and change notation matching the prompt's specifications and example. No extra commentary, no unchanged elements mentioned—fully compliant with instructions.

Minor deductions for formatting differences vs. ground truth (-0.8 total):
- Absence of bullet points (-) before each item (-0.5; present in all ground truth list items).
- No alignment spacing in second gateway line (-0.2; ground truth has ~5 spaces after ":" for visual alignment).
- Slight whitespace variations after headings (negligible, but contributes to non-byte-identical match).

Utmost strictness applied; content excellence offsets small cosmetic diffs, but not fully identical text.
