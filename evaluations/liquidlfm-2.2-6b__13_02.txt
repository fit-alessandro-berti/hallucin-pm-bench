The LLM answer is correct and precise on questions 1 and 2 (exact match to ground truth numerics and formatting). For question 3, it adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, mentions the single occurrence (i), cautions against over-generalization (iii), and implies instability via "inaccurate predictions" and "outlier activities." However, it falls short on explicitly noting variance/instability (ii) with statistical examples (e.g., skewing averages, noise, confidence intervals) as emphasized in ground truth, and introduces minor invention ("biasing toward faster 'auto' checks," not directly data-derived), warranting a strict deduction of 2 points.
