**1.0**

The LLM answer fails on multiple critical dimensions with utmost strictness applied:

- **Vocabulary violations**: Merges "Intake Vetting" and "KYC Review" into one column with parentheses ("Intake Vetting (KYC Review)"), explicitly forbidden ("even in explanations or parentheses"). Adds unauthorized activities ("Escalation for Review", "Funds Release & Notification") instead of using only the four mandated terms without renaming/merging/adding.
- **Matrix structure/incompleteness**: Transposed (roles as rows vs. ground truth's activities as rows); 5 columns vs. 6 activities; incomplete coverage (e.g., no separation of KYC Review/AML Screening; misses precise "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds").
- **RACI assignments**: No matches to ground truth (e.g., Front-Office Analyst is "Responsible" for merged activity vs. **R,A** only for Intake Vetting; Compliance Analyst "Accountable" for merged vs. **R,A** separately for KYC/AML; Compliance Officer wrongly "Responsible" for merged and dashed elsewhere vs. **A** in Risk Scoring/**R,A** in Approval; widespread mismatches like Treasury Ops "Informed" everywhere vs. nuanced I/C).
- **Formatting/output**: No bolding for activities/R,A; inconsistent dashes (- vs. –); extraneous note with justifications, typos ("Offficer"), and re-explaining forbidden terms, violating "Return the matrix as a Markdown table".
- **Overall**: Fundamentally diverges from ground truth; does not "cover every activity" without merge/add/rename. Minimal partial credit for Markdown table and partial use of 4 terms.
