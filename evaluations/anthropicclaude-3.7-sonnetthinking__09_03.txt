The LLM answer correctly states the impossibility of computing the requested metrics, accurately cites the absence of event data and timestamps, and distinguishes between what the log and SLA provide versus what is required. However, there are minor verbosity and slight expansions compared to the highly concise and focused ground truth (e.g., the LLM mentions “redacted for privacy reasons” and distinguishes between cycle time within and between activities, which, while technically accurate, introduces slight elaboration outside the strict minimum needed). Also, the use of a heading ("Inability to Compute 'Approve Invoice' Cycle Time")—while clear—is not strictly plain text as requested, though it's a very minor formatting deviation. These details justify a strict one-point deduction.
