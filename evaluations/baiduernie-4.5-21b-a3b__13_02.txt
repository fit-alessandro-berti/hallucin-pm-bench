**9.5**

- **Q1:** Correct: "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time**.
- **Q2a:** Correct percentage: (1/48)×100 ≈ **2.08%**.
- **Q2b:** Correct percentage: (1/12)×100 ≈ **8.33%**.
- **Q3:** The answer notes (i) single occurrence, (ii) the statistical risk (outlier, rare, can bias analysis, skew statistics), and (iii) cautions against over-generalisation. It does not explicitly mention variance/instability or confidence intervals, but it addresses the analytic risks and bias in generalisation.

**Deduction:**  
- -0.5 for Q3: The explanation is strong but could more directly mention the instability/variance, e.g., “unstable statistics on one instance” or “high uncertainty.”
- Numeric portions are flawless.
- No fabricated information or omissions.

**Overall:** The answer is nearly perfect with merely a minor shortfall in Q3’s depth regarding statistical instability.
