The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on questions 1 and 2 (a/b), with correct counts, calculations, and rounding. For question 3, the response (78 words) appropriately addresses the single-occurrence issue ("occurs only once"), notes variance/instability through implications of outlier bias and skewed estimates ("incorrectly imply... common... overestimate... distorting"), and cautions against over-generalization ("could bias algorithms... distort insights"), fulfilling all required elements without invention or excess.
