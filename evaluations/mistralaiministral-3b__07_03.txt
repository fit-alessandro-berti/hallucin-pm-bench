The LLM answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, matching the ground truth verbatim in content and format for those sections. However, it misses the Gateway_Payment change (exclusive â†’ parallel), which is a verifiable functional difference present in the XML snippets and required under "all functional changes." This omission is a significant error, as it fails to summarize all differences strictly as instructed. Minor formatting issues (bold headings instead of plain text, as required verbatim) further deduct points, though they are secondary to the content miss.
