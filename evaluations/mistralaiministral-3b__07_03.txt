The LLM answer omits a required gateway type change:

- It correctly lists all three *added tasks*.
- It correctly lists the single *removed task*.
- It correctly lists the gateway type change for `Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel`.
- **But it fails to list the gateway type change for `Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel`**, which is explicitly present in the ground truth.

Omission of a clearly visible required change in the "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" section is a substantial error and, as per the instruction for strictness, should result in significant loss of points. The rest of the answer is accurate and formatted correctly, thus partial credit is merited.
