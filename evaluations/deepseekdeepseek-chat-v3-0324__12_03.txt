The LLM answer is highly accurate and well-justified, citing the exact cases (C002 and C004) that violate the stated fact. It also correctly notes the only compliant cases (C001 and C003). The sequences and rationale are direct and consistent with the log. However, compared to the ground-truth answer, it is missing a detailed, tabular breakdown per case and does not explicitly state for each case whether the immediate successor condition is met (with check marks, etc.). It also does not mention the total count (“two out of the four cases violate...”), nor does it repeat the explicit conclusion regarding the "always" claim. These omissions, though relatively minor, constitute a measurable loss of detail and rigor as present in the ground-truth. Hence, a one-point deduction for missing completeness and exhaustiveness.
