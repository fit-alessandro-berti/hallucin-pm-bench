The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in conclusion (No), identification of violating cases (C002 and C004 with exact sequences), and compliant cases (C001 and C003). It fully addresses the task by providing a clear Yes/No followed by justification citing relevant CaseIDs and sequences. The only difference is presentation (bullets vs. table), which does not impact accuracy or completeness. No errors or omissions.
