4.0

### Evaluation Reasoning
- **R1**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification similar (both note approvals for high amount). No deduction.
- **R2**: Major error—status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated). Justification flawed (ignores post-change approval as "last required," miscalculates timing). Significant loss (-2.0 points equivalent).
- **R3**: Status matches (Violated). Justification equivalent (both note Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods). No deduction.
- **R4**: Status matches (Not Applicable). Justification equivalent (both cite hazardous=false). No deduction.
- **R5**: Status matches (Violated). Justification partially correct but incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice before new approval; focuses only on Ship_Goods). Minor deduction (-0.5 points equivalent).
- **R6**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification equivalent (both note Archive_Record at end). No deduction.
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT). No deduction.
- **General**: Format adheres to prompt (concise, ≤20 words per justification). However, R2's critical mismatch and R5 incompleteness warrant strict penalty; score reflects ~67% accuracy across rules with heavy weighting on errors.
