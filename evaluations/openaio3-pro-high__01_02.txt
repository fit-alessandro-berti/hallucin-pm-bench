### Explanation of Evaluation
- **Decision Points (Major Issues, ~60% weight)**: The ground truth strictly identifies only the true branching/final decision gates (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval), focusing on flow-altering outcomes without inferring details. The LLM answer incorrectly expands this to 8 items, treating verification/assessment steps (e.g., Quick KYC Verification, Community Impact Assessment, individual underwriter scores, Neighbourhood Feedback Check) as "decision points" with added, unstated outcomes like "pass/fail" or "satisfactory." This introduces extraneous content, deviates from the process's exact flow, and ignores the prompt's emphasis on precise activity names without additions. Minor errors include "tie-break score" (ground truth/process says "decision") and over-detailing jumps (e.g., "jumps to Disburse Funds"). These differences are substantial, warranting a low sub-score (~3.0/10).
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Issues, ~40% weight)**: The list is complete and uses near-exact titles from the process description, matching all 6 items without introducing standard loan terms. Phrasing is very close (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"; inclusion of "single" and "template" aligns with source but ground truth shortens slightly). The ground truth's added note on exclusions is implied by the prompt but not required; LLM omits it but doesn't contradict. Sub-score (~8.0/10).

- **Overall**: Strict deduction for core mismatch in decision points (over-inclusion and inferences violate "summarise... using exactly the activity names" and non-standard process fidelity), partially offset by accurate documents. No jailbreak or policy violations in the LLM answer.
