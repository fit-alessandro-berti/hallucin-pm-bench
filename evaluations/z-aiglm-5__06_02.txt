The LLM answer is identical to the ground truth in content, structure, task names, order, numbering, and comma separation (with standard single spaces after commas). Minor rendering differences in trailing whitespace (present in ground truth lines 1-2) are insignificant and do not constitute an error under the prompt's requirements.
