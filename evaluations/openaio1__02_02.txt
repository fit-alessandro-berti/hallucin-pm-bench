A1. Accurate. The LLM answer correctly identifies that there are 3 distinct cases, exactly as in the ground truth.

A2. Perfect. The LLM precisely lists the activities for case C002 in the correct order and with the correct use of arrows and underscores (“→” and underscores are required, though it accepted the rendering with “_” as representing underscores; it matches the prompt's requirement). Both the LLM answer and the ground truth use underscores in activity names and use the correct sequence.

A3. The LLM answer lists:
1) Arrange_Delivery  
2) Check_Stock  

The ground truth lists:
- Arrange\_Delivery  
- Check\_Stock  

The only (minor) discrepancy is in the list formatting (the ground truth uses dashes and underscores; the LLM uses a numbered list and shows the activity names without underscores). The LLM did not preserve the exact activity labels with underscores as found in the XES fragment and ground truth. In process mining, activity labels are case and character sensitive. While the logic is entirely correct, this deviation from the prescribed label format (“Arrange\_Delivery” vs “Arrange_Delivery”) represents a small but quantifiable error.

Because the answers are otherwise perfect in logic and content and all information is correct, I deduct 0.5 points due to the formatting/naming convention error in A3.
