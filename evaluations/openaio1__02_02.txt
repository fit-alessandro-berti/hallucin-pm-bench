The LLM answer is factually accurate across all questions, with no missing, extra, or fabricated elements in the core content (distinct cases, sequence, and predecessors). Q1 matches precisely in substance, though slightly verbose. Q2 is an exact match. Q3 correctly identifies and orders the two activities but includes unnecessary introductory text, numbering (instead of plain one-per-line listing), and minor formatting deviations from the ground truth's bulleted styleâ€”warranting a deduction for not adhering strictly to the prompt's listing instruction, per the evaluation criteria's emphasis on precision.
