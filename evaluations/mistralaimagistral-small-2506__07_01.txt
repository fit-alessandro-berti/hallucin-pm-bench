The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, it deviates from the ground truth in several ways that warrant deductions under strict evaluation: (1) unnecessary introductory sentence ("Here are the factual differences...") violates the prompt's "list **only** the factual differences" instruction; (2) headings use "###" markdown instead of "**bold**" as in ground truth; (3) item formatting mismatches significantlyâ€”e.g., "task#id (name: 'Name')" instead of "Name (id = `id`)", introducing non-XML elements like "task#" and "name:" which speculatively alter "exact" XML usage; (4) gateway description omits "(v1)" and "(v2)" versioning for clarity; (5) ending phrase "(No other changes detected)" differs from ground truth's phrasing, though functionally similar. These format and extraneous details accumulate to a moderate score, as core facts are accurate but presentation errors are notable.
