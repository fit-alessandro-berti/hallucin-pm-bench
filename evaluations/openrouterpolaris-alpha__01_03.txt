5.0

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the ground truth, penalizing differences in accuracy, completeness, structure, and fidelity to the prompt's process description. Small errors (e.g., imprecise phrasing, extraneous inclusions) result in notable point deductions, as instructed. The score reflects partial correctness but substantial deviations in both parts (a) and (b), leading to an overall mid-range but deduct-heavy grade.

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- **Strengths**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two actual decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate) with phrasing that is mostly aligned (e.g., "Low or Medium AND ... ≤ €250,000" matches closely; "at least two of the three ... approve" is similar to "at least two ... record 'Approve'").
- **Errors and Deductions**:
  - Includes an extraneous "decision point" for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself ("assigns a Low, Medium, or High risk rating"), which is not a gate or conditional branch per the prompt—it's merely an input step. The ground truth explicitly lists only two decision points, focusing on the actual branches/gates (risk skip and TriVote). This adds a non-existent element, constituting a hallucination-like error (+2.0 deduction for inaccuracy and over-inclusion).
  - Structure deviates: Labels the first as "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" (misnaming the decision) and numbers three items, while ground truth numbers two with precise titles (e.g., "**Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check**"). Minor phrasing issues (e.g., no bolding for emphasis, "the system assigns" implies automation not specified) add to imprecision (-1.0 deduction).
- **Sub-score**: 5.0/10 (core rules are captured but distorted by extra/misidentified point).

#### Part (b): Documents
- **Strengths**: Correctly lists most documents in near-correct order of first appearance (Form 14B in step 1; scorecards in step 3; Deck Memo in step 5; Offer Sheet 77 in step 7; ID Matrix Declaration and Loan Dossier 2025 in steps 8–9). No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML items).
- **Errors and Deductions**:
  - Incomplete list: Omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document, which the ground truth explicitly separates (item 7) due to its requirement in step 8 ("Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration"). The LLM lumps it implicitly under "Offer Sheet 77" (item 6) and skips to ID Matrix Declaration (item 7), resulting in only 8 items vs. ground truth's 9. This is a significant omission, as the signed version is a required output/document in the process (-3.0 deduction for incompleteness).
  - Minor order/nuance issue: Places ID Matrix Declaration after Offer Sheet 77 but before Loan Dossier 2025, which aligns superficially, but fails to reflect the paired appearance in step 8 (Signed Offer + ID Matrix). No bolding or exact formatting as in ground truth.
- **Sub-score**: 6.0/10 (mostly accurate but critically missing one key document).

#### Overall
- Total differences: ~40% deviation (wrong count/structure in (a); incomplete in (b)), with strict penalties for errors that alter the summary's fidelity to the process. No part is flawless, but no total failure. Final score averages sub-scores with deductions for cumulative impact.
