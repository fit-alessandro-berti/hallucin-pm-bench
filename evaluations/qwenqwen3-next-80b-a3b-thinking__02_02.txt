9.0

The LLM answer is factually accurate across all questions, with no hallucinations, missing elements, or fabrications. Q1 matches exactly. Q2 matches the sequence and activities precisely, including underscores, but deducts 1.0 point for minor inconsistency in separator formatting (no spaces around "â†’", unlike the ground truth's spaced version, treated as a small presentation error under strict evaluation). Q3 lists the correct distinct activities in proper alphabetical order (Arrange_Delivery before Check_Stock), one per line, with no extras or omissions, but deducts 0.0 additional points despite lacking the ground truth's dashes (prompt does not require them, so no penalty for absence). Overall, near-perfect alignment with ground truth, but strict policy on any deviation (even cosmetic) prevents a full 10.0.
