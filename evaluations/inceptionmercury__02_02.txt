10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, sequence, and ordering for all questions. Minor formatting variations (e.g., absence of dashes in Q3, escaped underscores in ground truth) do not constitute errors, as they do not alter the precision or completeness of the responses. No hallucinations, omissions, or inaccuracies detected under strict evaluation.
