9.0

**Evaluation:**

- Q1: Correct, matches ground truth.
- Q2: Correct, matches ground truth exactly (activity names and order, separator, and case filtering).
- Q3: Almost perfect, BUT there is a subtle formatting issue. The LLM wrote "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" as required, but did not use the underscore version for "Check_Stock"â€”looking at the log, both activities are called with underscores: "Check_Stock" and "Arrange_Delivery".
    - Also, LLM omitted the "underscore" in "Check_Stock" (actually it preserved it!), so on close reading, the answer matches exactly the given log, so there is no error here.
    - However, a smaller issue: the LLM removed the underscores in its text explanations throughout (see Q1 and the rest of the answer), which could be penalized as a formatting inconsistency, but not in the final answers.

**In summary:**  
Factually everything is perfect, including the order and labels. There are no major errors or hallucinations, and alphabetization in Q3 is respected.

**Due to the instruction for 'utmost strictness, also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points,' I dock 1 full point for failing to provide the activity names in code-like format (either in code block or monospace) or for not using the answer table structure provided in ground truth (since this is a comparison). But this is a borderline case.

**Final score: 9.0**
