1️⃣ The answer for part 1 is correct and unambiguous.

2️⃣ The explanation in part 2 addresses key points: extremely small sample size, statistical unreliability, representation issues, limited temporal coverage, and possible naming inconsistencies. However, compared to the ground truth, it misses the very precise mention of the “wide confidence interval” and the quantification that a single appearance equates to 7% (ground truth gives a concrete example, while the LLM answer mentions unreliability more generally). The LLM answer’s point on naming inconsistencies is valid, but it could clarify better that strict string matching may undercount and fuzzy matching may overcount; the ground truth is crisper in laying out how both directions can bias the estimate.

Overall, the LLM answer is very good, covers nearly all points, and has no factual errors, but lacks some of the statistical detail and precision present in the ground truth. Therefore, a one-point deduction is applied for thoroughness and completeness.
