The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" and accurately pinpoints violations in Rules 2 and 3 with appropriate event citations, matching the ground truth's core reasoning. However, deductions for: (1) incorrect distance calculation for Rule 3 (states "distance = 4" vs. ground truth "distance = 3"); (2) incomplete justification omitting analysis of Rules 1, 4, and 5 (ground truth confirms they are satisfied); (3) lack of numbered structure per prompt format ("numbered justification")—uses unnumbered sentences instead of 1–5 breakdown; (4) less precise phrasing (e.g., no explicit "first occurrence" emphasis or full rule satisfaction checks). These differences, though not altering the outcome, warrant strict point loss for lack of comprehensiveness and precision.
