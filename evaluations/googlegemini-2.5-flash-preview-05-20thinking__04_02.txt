**Justification:**  
The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth in both outcome and justification for each rule, as well as the final result. The main differences:

- For R2, the LLM's justification says Ship_Goods occurred before new Manager_Approval (reflecting the actual process problem), whereas the ground truth phrase is more explicit: Ship_Goods happened before the required new approval and outside the 2-day expedited window. However, the essential reasoning is correct in both.
- For R5, both answers note that required approval was missing before further processing, and reference the same problematic events.
- All other rule answers and the final statement match almost exactly.
- The answer format is nearly perfect but could tighten the justifications to ensure â‰¤ 20 words (though they're just at or slightly over for some).

Due to the small difference in how the R2 justification is worded and a lack of explicit reference to "within 2 calendar days" for R2, I penalize 1 point. Otherwise, this is a highly accurate and complete answer strictly adhering to both content and structure requirements.
