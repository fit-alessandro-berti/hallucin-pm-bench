9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and fits the rubric (utmost strictness):

- All tasks added and removed are correctly identified, with their IDs accurate.
- The gateway-type change is correctly noted.
- The answer omits the human-readable task names (e.g., “Verify Identity”), providing only element IDs. The answer does, however, maintain the proper groupings and clear enumeration.
- Only minor deduct: It does not give both the display name and the element ID for each task as seen in the ground truth ("Verify Identity" (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)), and it does not note the gateway mapping using both the gateway ID and explicit (XOR/OR) notation (even though it does say "Exclusive" and "Inclusive").
- The format (bullets, no heading formatting) is slightly less detailed than the ground truth.

Thus, one point is docked for not precisely matching the ground truth format and for omitting task names, but content accuracy is otherwise flawless.

Final score: 9.0
