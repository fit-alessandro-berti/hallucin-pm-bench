7.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated vocabulary: “KYC Review,” “Order Vetting,” and “Payment Clearance”—no forbidden terms appear.
- Activities are mapped accurately in sequence and associated roles (“AM,” “CO,” “FC,” “IT”) are consistently used.
- No extra, missing, or incorrectly named activities.

**Deficiencies (each leading to point deductions):**

1. **Column Labels:**  
   - The LLM uses role abbreviations (“AM”, “CO”, etc.) instead of the full role names as shown in the Ground Truth. This is a moderate formatting error, as clarity and explicit mapping are crucial in a RACI matrix.

2. **Cell Entries — RACI Coding:**
   - The LLM encodes entries as “R/A”, never separating “Responsible” and “Accountable” as in the ground truth (where one role is *Responsible* and another is *Accountable*, unless the same role is R and A).
   - For “KYC Review,” the LLM lists “R/A” for CO, while ground truth splits R for CO, A for AM.
   - For Record Update, “R/A” is given to IT, rather than R: IT, C: AM, I: FC, I: CO as per ground truth.
   - The LLM excludes Collaborator (C) and Informed (I) roles, only showing R/A.
   - For activities like “Receive Application” and “Order Vetting,” the LLM doesn’t specify C/I entries (e.g., AM = R/A, misses I: IT, etc.), a critical loss of information.
   - Imprecise RACI assignment is the most severe error and impacts the accuracy of the process model significantly.

3. **Capitalization Consistency:**  
   - The LLM’s column headers are in lower/upper case (“Activity,” “AM,” etc.); ground truth is Pascal Case (“Activity,” “Account Manager,” etc.). This is a minor but relevant stylistic difference.

4. **Formatting/Structure:**  
   - The LLM omits the “/” (slashes) between R and A in some cases. In the ground truth, when the same role is both R and A, “R / A” is specified.
   - Several rows are compressed into a single “R/A” per activity, rather than expressing R and A (and C, I) distinctly.

**Summary:**  
- The LLM’s answer has no forbidden synonyms and gets the activities/sequence right, but falls notably short in RACI accuracy (missing collaborators and informed, misallocating accountability), and format (role abbreviation). These are significant faults in a process-mapping context. Strict grading requires significant point deduction. 

**Final score:** 7.0
