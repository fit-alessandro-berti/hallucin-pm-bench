The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without forbidden variants, includes all activities and roles without extras, and identifies one Responsible (combined with Accountable) per activity, aligning with the narrative's primary handlers. However, it is severely incomplete as a RACI matrix: it leaves all cells blank except for the R/A in each row, failing to assign Consulted (C) or Informed (I) roles as shown in the ground truth (e.g., no C for Compliance Officer in Receive Application, no I for IT Support across multiple activities). Role headers use abbreviations instead of full names, and formatting lacks the ground truth's bolding and spacing precision. These omissions and deviations make it an inadequate RACI matrix, warranting a low score under strict evaluation.
