The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a one-paragraph justification citing the exact same two counterexamples (C003 line 6 and C005 line 11) with case-IDs and line numbers, accurately noting the absence of prior *Receive_Order* in both, matching the ground truth's core logic and proof of the claim's falsity. Minor deductions for: (1) introducing "directly follow" (unnecessary and absent from claim/ground truth); (2) imprecise phrasing for C005 ("before its only *Receive_Order* (which never appears)" implies an expected post-event *Receive_Order* rather than ground truth's cleaner "never contains *Receive_Order* at all," misrepresenting the log's complete absence); (3) slightly awkward conclusion ("every instance of the fragment" vs. ground truth's "provided log"); (4) paragraph vs. ground truth's bullets (though LLM follows prompt's "one paragraph" exactly). These are small phrasing/precision issues under utmost strictness but do not undermine the factual correctness or completeness.
