7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment as the three worst-performing activities based on both SLA breaches and high waiting time, as per the data in the table. It also accurately quantifies by how much each exceeds the SLA, with correct calculation of the differences.

However, there are notable and significant deviations from the ground truth that warrant a loss of points:

- The LLM introduces recommendations that are not fully or directly grounded in the supplied data. For example, “Increase assessor capacity by 25%... to reduce average waiting below 150 seconds,” “Implement parallel review streams... to cut average throughput by at least 50%...” and “Add a second full-time approver...” all speculate on actions and their impact without specific support in the data. The ground truth recommendation style is more strictly tied to process simplification based on the observable problem (e.g., bypassing unnecessary legal approval, automating score retrieval), not hypothesized FTE increases or percentage improvements not directly extractable from the table.

- The LLM answer references “rebalancing capacity” and estimates quantitative effects (e.g., “cut average throughput by at least 50%”) not justified anywhere in the prompt or provided data — this is explicitly against the instruction to not invent metrics or activities.

- The ground truth memo includes the total completed cases and a short summary sentence about projected impact (“reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35 %”), which is missing from the LLM response, making the latter less comprehensive.

- The ground truth's recommendations are more specific and operational — for instance, “Introduce rule-based pre-checks so low-risk files bypass full Legal Approval” and “Deploy a straight-through heuristic,” rather than generic staffing/capacity adjustments.

- Minor point: the LLM answer omits some memo conventions (To/From/Subject) included in the model answer, although this may be less critical given the prompt's focus on memo text only.

Overall, the LLM's identification and quantification are accurate, but the recommendations deviate significantly from the requirement to ground every sentence in the supplied data and not to invent new metrics/assumptions. These errors are significant in this context per the instructions for strict grading.
