### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core correctness (high marks)**: LLM correctly identifies impossibility due to redacted timestamps, links to cycle time needing start/complete times, and extends to std dev/CI. Matches ground truth's key reason (absent data prevents metrics).
- **Penalties (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Structure mismatch (-1.5)**: Task specifies "one short paragraph" for explanation (part 3); LLM uses separate numbered points (1,2,3), violating conciseness and format. Ground truth is single cohesive paragraph.
  - **Precision gaps (-0.8)**: Doesn't explicitly note "all event rows removed" or "only column headers" (artefact A detail); focuses narrowly on "timestamps redacted," implying partial data exists. Ground truth precisely cites "all event rows and every timestamp... redacted."
  - **Verbosity/repetition (-0.3)**: More wordy/repetitive across points vs. ground truth's tight "Impossible—" opener and single flow.
  - **Missing elements (-0.2)**: Omits "for any 'Approve Invoice' execution" specificity and "additional raw log entries required."
- Overall: Strong semantic match (~85% alignment) but form/precision errors warrant drop from 10.0 under "utmost strictness."
