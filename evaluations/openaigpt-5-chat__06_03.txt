The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks in the specified order for Process B, with no extraneous information about other processes. However, it deducts points for minor differences: an unnecessary introductory sentence, lack of explicit "parallel block" labels, bullet-point formatting instead of inline with the â€– symbol, and omission of the confirmatory sentence about no other parallel tasks, which slightly deviates from the ground truth's precise structure and completeness.
