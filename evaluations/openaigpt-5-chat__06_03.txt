The LLM answer very closely matches the ground truth in both content and structure:

- It identifies both parallel blocks, with the correct sets of tasks in each (Quality_Check & Update_Inventory; Generate_Replenishment_Report & Notify_Procurement).
- The order and numbering correspond to the order of appearance in the process.
- The answer refrains from providing any information about Processes A or C, as requested.

Minor deduction (0.5 points) is warranted because the LLM omits explicit references to the parallel constructs as "first/second parallel block" and uses slightly more freeform phrasing ("within the same parallel construct" instead of explicitly restating the structural block). Additionally, while the sets are clear, the answer quotes the sets as "Set 1" and "Set 2" without further detail about the block context, which the ground truth does include ("first parallel block" / "second parallel block").

Otherwise, no substantive errors or inaccuracies are present.
