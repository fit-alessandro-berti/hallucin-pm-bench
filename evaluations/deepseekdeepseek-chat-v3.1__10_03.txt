3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms. However, it fails strict compliance in several critical ways, leading to a low score under utmost strictness:

- **Added and renamed activities (major violation)**: The prompt instructs "do not rename, merge, or add activities" while covering every described activity. The ground truth expands logically into six rows (the four core + "Compliance Officer Approval" + "Release Funds") to encompass the narrative's escalation, scheduling, release, and notification without adding extraneous rows. The LLM adds three unauthorized rows ("Approval (Score > 70)", "Schedule/Release Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst"), renames the approval/escalation process, and merges scheduling/release imprecisely. This introduces differences not aligned with the ground truth structure, representing a significant deviation (e.g., notification is distributed as "I" across ground truth rows, not isolated).

- **Incomplete and inaccurate RACI assignments (major violation)**: Nearly every cell mismatches the ground truth, omitting key roles (e.g., no "C" for Compliance Analyst in Intake Vetting; missing "A" for Compliance Officer in Risk Scoring; no "I" for Treasury Ops in core activities). The LLM uses single "R" or "A" where ground truth combines "R, A" or includes multiples like "C" and "I". It ignores distributed involvement (e.g., Front-Office Analyst as "C" in Risk Scoring or "I" in Approval). Only ~20% of assignments align partially (e.g., Compliance Analyst "R" for KYC/AML), but omissions and extras compound errors.

- **Formatting inconsistencies (minor but penalized)**: Activities are bolded (matches ground truth), but columns are centered vs. left-aligned; empty cells are blank vs. "–" for no involvement; no bolding of "R, A" as in ground truth. The header ("Activity / Role") slightly differs from ground truth's "Activity".

- **Overall coverage**: While it attempts to cover the narrative, the additions and gaps result in incomplete representation of roles/activities, diverging sharply from the ground truth's precise breakdown. Small errors (e.g., missing "–") are penalized, but the structural and content mismatches dominate, justifying a score well below 5.0.
