3.0

The LLM answer has significant deviations from the ground truth, both in structure and detail, warranting a strict deduction:

- **Vocabulary Compliance:** The answer uses only the four mandated terms for activities (good), and no prohibited synonyms appear (good).
- **Activity Names:** The LLM's matrix omits "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds", adds nonconforming activity names ("Approval (Score > 70)", "Schedule/Release Payment", "Notify Originating Analyst"), and merges/splits activities, violating the instruction to not rename, merge, or add activities.
- **RACI Assignments:**  
    - "Intake Vetting": Should be "R, A" for Front-Office Analyst, but only "R" is given; the remaining roles are blank or unassigned where ground truth has C/I.
    - "KYC Review": Should be "R, A" for Compliance Analyst, but only "R" is given; missing C/I for other roles.
    - "AML Screening": Should be "R, A" for Compliance Analyst, only "R" is given.
    - "Risk Scoring": Should have Compliance Analyst as R, Compliance Officer as A, others as C/I; answer only gives "R" to Compliance Analyst, omitting others and splitting R/A incorrectly.
    - "Compliance Officer Approval" is missing as a row; "Approval (Score > 70)" does not map correctly and also omits the proper RACI distribution.
    - "Release Funds" is missing; "Schedule/Release Payment" is present, but assigned only "R" to Treasury Ops (should be "R, A"); missing C/I for others.
    - "Notify Originating Analyst" is not listed in the ground truth.

- **Formatting:**  
    - Does not comply with the "R, A" single-cell notation or the use of dashes for no involvement.
    - Columns are mostly sparse rather than granular, omitting C/I and A when required.

**In summary:**  
- Strong points: correct use of mandated vocabulary; avoids disallowed synonyms.
- Major weaknesses: incorrect activities, incomplete RACI assignments, non-granular mapping, and significant deviations from the required table structure and content.

Strict assessment therefore sets this answer at **3.0** due to partial, but still deeply flawed, compliance.
