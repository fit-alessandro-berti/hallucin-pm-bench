8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities by waiting time ("Request_Documents," "Send_Closure_Letter," "Assess_Liability") and accurately quotes both their average and 95th-percentile waiting times, which matches the ground truth.

All recommendations are concrete, plausibly data-driven, and aim to cut waiting times by at least 20%, directly address waiting time (not service or throughput), and stay within the memo length. The memo also does not discuss any activities or metrics not in the table, in line with instructions.

However, there are minor but strict errors and omissions:

- The recommendations, while sound, are less precise, business-tailored, or data-backed than the ground truth:  
    * For "Request_Documents," the LLM proposes automation but omits escalation triggers and pilot data supporting ≥25% reduction.  
    * For "Send_Closure_Letter," the shift to "centralized email templates" is less specific and impactful than the ground truth's switch to "same-day e-signature letters at closure."  
    * For "Assess_Liability," "triage/prioritization" is valid but misses the concrete element of rules-engine pre-classification and bypass for simple cases.
- Explicit, quantified reduction percentages and supporting information (e.g., pilot test results or estimated gains) are omitted or generalized as "target: 20% reduction." The ground truth is stricter in quoting concrete reductions ("≥25% cut," "30% reduction," etc.).
- "These actions are data-driven" is a claim not strictly substantiated in every suggestion.

These are not large enough faults for a loss of several points since the ranking, activities, and waiting-time numbers are all exact. However, the recommendations are less sharply matched to the table data, not as precisely actionable, or as quantitatively supported as in the ground truth, meriting a deduction of 2 points for strictness.
