7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes the required metrics verbatim (avg and 95th-percentile waiting times), avoids any discussion of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities, and stays under 150 words (approx. 120 words). It structures a professional memo format, which aligns with the "crisp executive memo" request.

However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:
- **Actions lack data-driven specificity**: The prompt requires "data-driven" recommendations promising ≥20% reduction. The LLM's actions are concrete and logically tied to waiting times but generic (e.g., "automate via digital portal" with a plain "target: 20%"), lacking any evidential support like the ground truth's "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%." This is a significant deviation, as it weakens the data-driven claim and invents unsupported targets without justification—resulting in a major points deduction (equivalent to ~2.0 off for this core element).
- **Minor format/style differences**: The LLM's polished structure (title, bullets, signature) is an improvement for executive readability but deviates from the ground truth's ultra-concise, numbered outline. No verbatim matching of phrasing (e.g., "h" vs. "hours," "95p" vs. "95th-percentile"), though not fatal, contributes to small errors under strictness (-0.5).

Overall, strong on facts and compliance (9/10), but action quality pulls it down due to differences from ground truth. No jailbreak or policy issues detected.
