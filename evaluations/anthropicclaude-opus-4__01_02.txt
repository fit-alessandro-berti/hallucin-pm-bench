7.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in structure and coverage but incurs deductions under strict criteria for deviations from the ground truth (GT) in wording, terminology, formatting, and minor additions/omissions. Key differences:

- **Decision Points**:
  - LLM introduces "loan amount" (twice), violating the prompt's rule against standard loan terminology (process/GT use "amount"). This is a clear, repeatable error warranting significant deduction (-1.0).
  - LLM adds step numbers (e.g., "(Step 5)"), absent in GT, and verbose phrasing (e.g., full question form for decisions), making it less concise than GT's exact summaries (-0.5).
  - LLM omits contextual positioning (e.g., GT specifies "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), reducing precision (-0.3).
  - Extra note in LLM's MBA ("Only applies to amounts ≥ €15,000") is accurate but not in GT, introducing unnecessary elaboration (-0.2).
  - Minor formatting diffs (e.g., "##" header, bolding vs. GT's "####" and italics) (-0.1).

- **Required Documents**:
  - High fidelity overall, but LLM expands phrasing slightly (e.g., "(≤ 3 months old)" vs. GT's "(≤ 3 months)"; "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"), deviating from GT's abbreviated style (-0.4).
  - LLM lacks GT's closing note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which emphasizes the non-standard nature, though not strictly required (-0.3).
  - No major omissions, but strict exactness to GT's wording is not met.

Base score: 9.5 for completeness and adherence to prompt structure/content. Total deductions: -2.3 for cumulative small-to-medium errors. Final: 7.2 (solid but not exemplary under utmost strictness).
