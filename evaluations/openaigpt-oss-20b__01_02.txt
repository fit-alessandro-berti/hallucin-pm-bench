### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major deductions for omissions and fidelity)**: The LLM correctly identifies the three core decision points and their basic logic, using exact activity names as required (e.g., no introduction of standard loan terms). However, it omits key contextual details from the ground truth, such as the Underwriter Alignment Gate occurring "after the Dual Underwriter Split" and specifying "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B scores" (instead using generic "two risk scores"). The Amount Threshold Decision misses "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check." Point 3 has minor capitalization differences ("approve/reject" vs. "Approve/Reject") and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., bolding in conditions). These omissions reduce precision and flow adherence, warranting a ~3-point deduction under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents (minor deductions for wording and completeness)**: The list is exhaustive and matches all items without extras, using exact terminology. However, it deviates in phrasing: adds "old" to Proof of Address (ground truth omits it, shortening to "â‰¤ 3 months"); expands Income Statement to "single pay-stub or tax slip" (ground truth condenses to "pay-stub/tax slip," omitting "single" and using "/"); adds "template" to CIS (ground truth omits it). Bullets vs. numbering and omission of the ground truth's explanatory note ("No credit bureau report...") are small but reflect incomplete alignment, costing ~0.5 points.

Overall, the LLM is strong on structure and core content but loses significantly on exactness and contextual details, aligning with strict evaluation guidelines.
