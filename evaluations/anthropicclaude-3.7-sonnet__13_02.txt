The LLM answer is fully accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b are precise (2.08% and 8.33%, correctly rounded to two decimals with proper calculations). For question 3, the explanation (72 words) meets all criteria: (i) addresses single-occurrence indirectly but clearly via "1 time" in Q1 and "only 8.33% of cases" (equating to one instance) with "insufficient data points"; (ii) notes variance/instability ("high variance results," "random variations"); (iii) cautions against over-generalization ("sampling bias when generalizing," "don't represent typical process behavior," "overfitting"). No inventions or errors; stays within data and word limit.
