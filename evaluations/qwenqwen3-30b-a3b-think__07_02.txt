7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and summarizes all key changes under the exact required headings, with no factual errors or omissions regarding the BPMN elements (e.g., all added tasks, the single removed task, and the gateway type change are accurate, and cosmetic changes like renamings are ignored as instructed). However, under utmost strictness, it incurs point deductions for the following differences from the ground truth:

- **Presentation of tasks (significant loss: -1.0)**: In "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks," the LLM reverses the order (ID first, then name in parentheses) compared to the ground truth (name first, ID in backticks). This is a clear structural mismatch, even if content is identical.
  
- **Gateway-type changes (moderate loss: -0.5)**: The LLM's description ("from **Exclusive Gateway** to **Inclusive Gateway**") omits the explanatory abbreviations "(XOR)" and "(OR)," as well as explicit version references (*v1* to *v2*), which are present in the ground truth for precision.

- **Formatting and extras (minor loss: -0.5 each, but capped)**: Headings use bullets/dashes (-) instead of numbered lists (1., 2., etc.); no introductory "## **Expected Answer Key**" or closing note ("*(No other...)*"), which adds completeness in the ground truth. While not core content, these deviate from the ground truth's style under strict evaluation. No over-additions or hallucinations, so loss is limited.

Base score for factual accuracy: 10.0. Total deductions: -2.5, yielding 7.5. The answer is highly effective but not identical in form or detail.
