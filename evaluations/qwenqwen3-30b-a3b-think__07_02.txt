9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It correctly identifies:

- All three added tasks by id and name.
- The single removed task by id and name.
- The correct gateway-type change, specifying the gateway id and the exclusiveâ†’inclusive change.

The only very minor issues are extremely slight wording differences, e.g.:
- The LLM answer does not mention "XOR"/"OR" or the parenthetical (*v1*, *v2*) in the gateway change, but it is implied and sufficiently clear for the purpose.
- It doesn't number the items or exactly match the ground truth's formatting/phrasing.

However, as instructed, even minor deviations (such as not repeating that the gateway change happened "(from v1 to v2)" or not specifying "exclusive (XOR)/inclusive (OR)") should result in some point loss. Therefore, 9.0/10.0 reflects strict assessment for these small details while acknowledging full correctness of the substance.
