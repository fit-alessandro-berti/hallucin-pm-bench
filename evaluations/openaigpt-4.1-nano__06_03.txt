9.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks (corresponding to the two parallel splits), lists them explicitly with the same grouping, and does so in the correct process order. The answer also refrains from mentioning Processes A or C as required.

The only extremely minor deviation is stylistic: the LLM uses "Parallel Split #1/#2" as set names instead of "Set 1/Set 2 â€“ [type]" and omits the explicit statement "No other tasks ... can run in parallel." These are very small omissions and do not significantly affect content, but per the instruction to apply utmost strictness and penalize even small errors, a deduction is warranted. Thus, 9.5/10.
