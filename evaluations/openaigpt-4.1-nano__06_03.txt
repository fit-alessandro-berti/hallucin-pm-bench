The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets in Process B with accurate task names and proper ordering, matching the core content of the ground truth. However, it loses points for: (1) including an unnecessary introductory sentence restating the process name (not present in ground truth, adding extraneous text); (2) using "Parallel Split #1/#2" terminology instead of the ground truth's "Set 1 – first parallel block" phrasing, which deviates from the expected descriptive labeling; (3) bullet-point formatting with dashes rather than the ground truth's inline backticks and ‖ symbol for parallelism notation; and (4) omitting the explicit closing statement "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," which provides completeness. These formatting, phrasing, and completeness differences, though minor, warrant a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
