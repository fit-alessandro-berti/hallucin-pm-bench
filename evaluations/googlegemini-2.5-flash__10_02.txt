5.0

**Justification:**

Major errors and partial compliance with requirements:

1. **Omission of "Operations Manager":** The LLM answer excludes the "Operations Manager" role, which is present in the ground truth and is crucial ("A" in every step). This is a significant oversight.

2. **Incorrect Responsibility Assignment:**
   - The LLM table frequently assigns "A" (Accountable) to "Regulatory Liaison" or "Transaction Analyst" where ground truth assigns it to "Operations Manager".
   - "Transaction Analyst" in the LLM answer is shown as Accountable for "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction" and "Screen Payment", but is only Responsible in ground truth.
   - "Regulatory Liaison" is Accountable and Responsible in areas where ground truth splits A and R.

3. **Inadequate RACI Distinction:** The answer often combines "R, A" in one cell. Proper RACI matrices separate these roles—one performer ("R") and one who is ultimately answerable ("A"). This lack of clarity reduces precision and traceability.

4. **Vocabulary Adherence:** The response does use the mandated role terms and activities, which is correct.

5. **Task Names and Mapping:**
   - Some task names ("Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission") are not directly from the ground truth, which uses "Archive Record" and "Release Payment".
   - The LLM answer combines or rewords steps and, in some cases, creates ambiguities (e.g., "Release Payment"/ "Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission").
   - The overall mapping to the ground truth activities is imperfect.

6. **Incorrect Use of “Informed/Consulted”:** The Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments are missing or misplaced in several tasks. For example, "KYC Review" does not have Consulted or Informed for the other roles.

7. **Legend:** The answer omits a legend, which is shown in the ground truth.

8. **Formatting:** Markdown table is generally correct, but the clarity and explicitness suffer from the merging of multiple RACI values in single cells.

**Conclusion:**  
While the major roles and activities appear and mandated terminology is (mostly) followed, omitting Operations Manager and blending A/R assignments reflects a lack of strict process discipline. There are notable deviations in role allocation and a lack of nuanced RACI mapping. The answer shows some understanding but falls short on critical details and clear accountability.  

**Overall: 5.0/10** — Satisfies some requirements but misses essential elements and demonstrates nontrivial structural and assignment errors.
