3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and adherence to RACI specifics, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Table Structure and Roles**: The LLM uses only three roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting the "Operations Manager" column present in the ground truth. This creates a mismatch in scope, as the ground truth explicitly includes this role across all tasks. LLM's columns are simpler but incomplete relative to ground truth.

- **Tasks/Activities**: 
  - LLM lists 7 tasks, including an extra "Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission" not in ground truth (which combines this into "Release Payment"). Ground truth has exactly 6 tasks.
  - Wording differs: e.g., "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen Payment against Sanctions List" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Perform KYC Review" vs. "**KYC Review**" (missing bold emphasis); "Approve High-Risk Transaction" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions" (singular vs. plural); "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record". These are not minor phrasing variations but substantive rewordings that alter clarity and fidelity to the source.
  - LLM fails to use the mandated "**KYC Review**" bolding in the task row as in ground truth.

- **RACI Assignments**: Nearly every assignment differs, showing poor alignment:
  - "Receive": LLM (R/A for Analyst/Liaison, blank IT) vs. ground truth (R/I/A/C for Analyst/Liaison/Ops/IT).
  - "Screen": Partial overlap (R/A for Analyst/Liaison) but misses I/C for Ops/IT.
  - "KYC Review": LLM (R,A for Liaison only) vs. ground truth (C/R/A/I across roles)—LLM incorrectly assigns dual R/A to Liaison without involving Analyst.
  - "Approve": LLM (I/R,A for Analyst/Liaison) vs. ground truth (C/R/A/I)—swaps I/C for Analyst and omits Ops/IT details.
  - "Release": LLM (R/A/I for Analyst/Liaison/IT) vs. ground truth (R/I/A/C)—reverses Liaison (A vs. I) and IT (I vs. C).
  - Extra LLM task "Ensure SWIFT" has no ground truth equivalent.
  - "Archive": LLM (A,I/R for Liaison/IT) vs. ground truth (C/I/A/R)—omits Analyst (C) and misplaces accountability.

- **RACI Notation and Completeness**: LLM uses blanks for uninvolved parties (implying no role) but never explicitly uses "C" for Consulted, unlike ground truth's consistent R/A/C/I across all cells. This violates full RACI representation. No legend is provided in LLM, while ground truth includes one.

- **Additional Elements**: LLM adds an unnecessary header ("AtlasRemit – Cross-Border Payment Process RACI Table") and intro sentence, absent in ground truth. Both use mandated vocabulary (e.g., "KYC Review"), but LLM's extra task and splits introduce unsubstantiated expansions not in the source or ground truth.

- **Overall Fidelity**: While LLM covers the source steps without omissions, it remaps RACI inaccurately (e.g., over-assigning A to Liaison) and introduces inconsistencies. Ground truth's notes on mapping and vocabulary are unmatched. Small errors (e.g., wording, bolding, notation) compound with major ones (assignments, extra task, missing role), justifying severe deduction from a perfect 10.0. A score of 3.5 reflects partial vocabulary adherence and source coverage but penalizes the pervasive mismatches.
