The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in conclusion (Non-compliant), identification of violations (Rules 2 and 3), and satisfaction of other rules (1, 4, 5), with precise citations to events and rules. Minor deductions for: (1) structural differenceâ€”focusing numbered justification only on violations with separate "Additional Notes" for satisfied rules, rather than numbering all rules 1-5 as in ground truth; (2) slight discrepancy in Rule 3 distance calculation (LLM states "distance of 4" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"), though both correctly identify the violation. These small issues warrant a strict but not severe penalty, as they do not alter the overall assessment.
