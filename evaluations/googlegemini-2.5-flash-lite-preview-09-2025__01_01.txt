### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, ~60% of Evaluation Weight)**: The ground truth identifies three distinct decision points, including implied ones from the process steps (eligibility validation in step 2, amount threshold in step 4, and approval outcomes in steps 3/4 per constraints). The LLM answer only covers one (the amount threshold), explicitly calling it the "only explicit" one and downplaying others as non-existent. This omits critical inferences from the process description (e.g., "validate eligibility" implies a binary outcome; "pre-approve has succeeded" implies rejection risk; constraints enforce approval gating). Strict scoring penalizes this omission heavily as incomplete coverage of "every decision point," resulting in substantial point loss. The LLM's structure (numbered list with paths) is clear but inaccurate in scope.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Strengths, ~40% of Evaluation Weight)**: The list matches the ground truth exactly in content (all 7 artefacts), with accurate ties to steps. No introductions of undefined items. However, the LLM lacks the ground truth's nuance on **AuditTrail** (conditional use but "part of the catalogue") and the closing disclaimer against legacy activities, which adds precision. This is a small deduction but reflects strictness on completeness.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt**: The answer is responsive and avoids undefined elements, but the under-identification of decisions creates a fundamental mismatch with the ground truth's comprehensive analysis. No jailbreak or policy issues apply. Total reflects strict weighting toward differences.
