The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly. Question 2a and 2b match the ground truth calculations and formatting, with correct rounding to two decimals. Question 3 adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (78 words), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue (explicitly notes "only one instance"), highlights variance/instability ("high variance and unstable averages"), and cautions against over-generalization ("overemphasize... misinforming broader process decisions"), while staying grounded in the log data and focusing on performance/predictive analyses. No inventions or deviations.
