The LLM answer is functionally perfect, identifying all exact added tasks (3), removed task (1), and gateway changes (2) with precise IDs, names, and type formats as specified (e.g., "id: old → new"). No extras, no omissions, no commentary—strictly compliant with prompt rules.  

Minor deductions (-0.5) for formatting differences vs. ground truth:  
- Missing leading "- " bullets on all 6 list items.  
- No alignment spaces on second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").  

Utmost strictness applied, but content match outweighs cosmetic text diffs.
