3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points Summary**: Major deficiencies. The LLM identifies only 1 explicit decision point (the amount threshold > â‚¬1,000), which partially aligns with ground truth #2. However, it completely omits ground truth #1 (eligibility check during triage, with explicit branching to rejection) and #3 (final approval/rejection at pre-approve/auditor levels). The LLM's claim of "only one explicit" ignores implicit decisions in validation and sign-off steps, as inferred in the ground truth. This results in an incomplete and inaccurate summary, failing to cover "every" decision point as prompted. Strict penalty for omission of two out of three core elements (-4.0 points equivalent).
  
- **List of Required Documents**: Near-perfect match. The LLM lists all 7 documents identically to the ground truth, including the conditional note on AuditTrail. Providing contextual associations (e.g., steps) is extraneous but not erroneous or introductory of new elements. No deductions here (+3.5 points equivalent).

- **Overall Adherence to Prompt**: The LLM stays within defined elements (no introductions, notes constraints), but the incomplete decision summary violates the core instruction to summarize "every" point. Structure is clear, but content gaps are severe under strict criteria. Total reflects ~50% accuracy weighted toward the more substantive decision section.
