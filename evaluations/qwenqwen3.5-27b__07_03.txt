9.0

The LLM answer is functionally perfect: it correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), using the exact required phrasing, IDs, names, and arrow format. Headings are verbatim and in order, with no extra commentary, unchanged elements, or guesses.

Minor formatting differences deduct 1.0 point under utmost strictness:
- Missing "- " bullets before every list item (6 instances).
- No alignment spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" in GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES (misaligns "exclusive → parallel").

Content match is exact; only whitespace/punctuation varies.
