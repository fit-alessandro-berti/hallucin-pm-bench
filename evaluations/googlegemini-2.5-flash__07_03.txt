7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed task, and gateway type changes) with exact IDs, names, and transition descriptions, matching the ground truth content verbatim. No extras, omissions, or commentary are present, adhering to the prompt's restrictions. However, strict evaluation penalizes formatting differences significantly: (1) bullet points use asterisks (*) instead of hyphens (-); (2) unnecessary backticks around all IDs; (3) extra leading spaces in bullet items (e.g., "*   " vs. clean "- "); (4) lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway item to match the colon positioning as in ground truth. These small inconsistencies deviate from the ground truth's precise presentation, warranting a deduction from a perfect score.
