9.5

- The LLM answer is almost perfectly aligned with the ground truth.
- For Q1: The answer states "3 distinct cases: C456, C123, C789" vs. the ground truth "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)". This is acceptable.
- For Q2: Both say "Pack_Items" (LLM answer adds a timestamp for clarity, which is not harmful but is a slight verbosity difference).
- For Q3: Both correctly identify "Cancel_Order". The LLM also notes "(only in case C789)"—slightly more verbose, but entirely correct.

Minor verbosity/formatting differences—especially the extra timestamp info in A2—prevent a perfect 10 under strictness, but factual content is fully correct and concise per prompt instructions.

**Score: 9.5**
