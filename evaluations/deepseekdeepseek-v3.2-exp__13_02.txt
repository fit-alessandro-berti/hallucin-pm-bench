The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth on questions 1 and 2 (exact counts and percentages, properly calculated and rounded). For question 3, the response is concise (78 words, under 100), adheres strictly to the log data without invention, and covers all required elements: it highlights the single-occurrence issue (rare variant, single instance), notes instability/variance (skewed by unique circumstances, incorrectly learned as standard), and cautions against over-generalization (misleading metrics, inaccurate forecasts, resource waste on outliers). No deviations or errors.
