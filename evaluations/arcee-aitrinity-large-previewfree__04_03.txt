The LLM answer correctly concludes "No" and properly assesses Rules 2, 3 (the key violation), and 4 as satisfied/violated matching the ground truth. However, it incorrectly flags Rule 1 as "Violated" (claiming broken order due to NA between QE and RA), while the ground truth explicitly marks Rule 1 as "✔ Satisfied" since QE precedes RA once each. This is a significant error in rule interpretation and justification (misconflating Rules 1 and 3), warranting a strict deduction despite the overall correct outcome. Format is acceptably similar (bullets vs. table), but content mismatch on Rule 1 reduces the score.
