**9.5**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in addressing the prompt: both correctly affirm "yes," provide a valid minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 fires before T3 (with p4=0 and T3 unfired), and offer brief, accurate justifications rooted in the inhibitor arc and asynchronous branches. Markings are precisely tracked in the LLM's superior table format (full vectors vs. ground truth's abbreviated notation).

Minor differences (0.5-point deduction under utmost strictness):
- Header omits ground truth's extra (accurate but unrequired) "must if ever to occur."
- Sequence stops correctly at T5 (sufficient for proof); ground truth extends unnecessarily to invalid T4 firing (p3=0 post-T5 blocks it).
- Justification emphases differ slightly (LLM: asynchrony/delay; ground truth: permanent disablement post-T3), but both correct/brief.
- LLM adds insightful table and "operational takeaway" (bonus clarity, no penalty).

No errors in LLM; it exceeds ground truth precision without introducing flaws.
