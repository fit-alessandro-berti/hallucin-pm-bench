The LLM answer accurately identifies the correct "No" response and provides a solid justification focusing on the key counterexamples (C003 and C005) with precise line citations, closely mirroring the ground truth's core content and logic. However, it deducts points for minor deviations under strict evaluation: unnecessary inclusion of positive examples (C001 and C002) not present in the ground truth, which adds extraneous detail; specific timestamps that are accurate but unrequired; and slightly more verbose phrasing ("the stated fact is not accurate" vs. "the claim is false"), introducing subtle differences in conciseness without enhancing relevance. These small additions and stylistic variances prevent a perfect score despite no factual errors.
