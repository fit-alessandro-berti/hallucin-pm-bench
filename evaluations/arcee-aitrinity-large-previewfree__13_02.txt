**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the deterministic ground truth exactly in values, calculations (1/48×100=2.08%; 1/12×100=8.33%), and rounding. For 3, the response (≤100 words) explicitly addresses single occurrence ("only one case"), variance/instability ("too sparse... unreliable statistical patterns", "outliers", "bias"), and over-generalisation ("misleading benchmarks if assumed representative"), fully meeting the criteria despite wording variation allowed. No errors, inventions, or deviations.
