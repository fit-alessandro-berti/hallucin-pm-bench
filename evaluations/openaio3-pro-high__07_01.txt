8.0

The LLM answer captures the core differences correctly under the required headings and uses the correct element names from the XML snippets:

- Under "Added tasks", it lists "check_vip" and "generate_qr" (element names, as requested).
- Under "Removed tasks", it lists "send_rma_label" (element name).
- Under "Gateway type changes", it notes the id and gateway type change appropriately.

However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer omits task names and element IDs in parentheses for each task (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Also, while the wording for the gateway change is correct and factual, it lacks bold formatting and the explicit explanatory text "changed from ... to ...".

Given that the prompt asked for use of element names exactly as in the XML but the ground truth used both the task name and the id (with id in parentheses), the omission of task names is a significant oversight. This is especially apparent since the ground truth does not solely rely on element IDs. The LLM also uses bullet points ("-") instead of the prompt's required bullet point style (asterisks for ground truth), but that's relatively minor.

Given these issues, especially the omission of task names, the answer deserves a significant but not devastating deduction: 8.0.
