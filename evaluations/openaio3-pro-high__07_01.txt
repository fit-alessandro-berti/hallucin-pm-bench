7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (contributing to higher score)**: The LLM correctly identified all factual differences—added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and the exact gateway type change for `gw_valid` (from exclusive to inclusive). Headings match the prompt's specified format exactly (using • for headings and - for list items). No speculation or extraneous information is added, and no irrelevant categories are included. The concise arrow notation (→) accurately conveys the change direction without error.
  
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness)**: 
  - For added and removed tasks, the LLM lists only task IDs, omitting the `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" and "Generate RMA QR Code" for additions; "Send RMA Label" for removal). The prompt requires using "element names exactly as they appear in the XML," which includes both ID and name as factual elements. This is a significant omission, as names are core identifiers in BPMN XML, leading to incomplete factual reporting (major deduction: -1.5 points).
  - Gateway change phrasing is functionally accurate but not verbatim to ground truth (e.g., lacks explicit "from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)" structure and uses plain text vs. bold/italics). This is a minor formatting/content mismatch but reflects strict adherence issues (-0.5 points).
  - No "(none)" category is needed here, so no issue, but overall, the response lacks the ground truth's descriptive detail and polished formatting (e.g., no * bullets, no parenthetical IDs, no final note), reducing completeness (-0.5 points).

Overall, the response is factually sound and prompt-compliant in structure but loses points for incomplete detail on task names, which is a key factual element from the XML. A perfect match to the ground truth's verbosity would score 10.0; this is strong but not meticulous enough under strict criteria.
