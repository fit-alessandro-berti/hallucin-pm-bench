2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) Assessment (Decision Points):**  
The LLM answer fails catastrophically here, earning a severe deduction. The ground truth identifies exactly **two** decision points: (1) the risk-based conditional skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check, and (2) the TriVote gate. The LLM incorrectly treats nearly the entire process as "decision points" by listing all 9 steps, including non-conditional actions like "Receive-Application" and "Prepare-Binding-Offer," which are not gates or branches. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the prompt's request for "every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch)."  
- The description of the risk condition is inverted and erroneous: It claims low/medium risk + ≤ €250k "skips to manual underwriting," but the process actually *skips* manual underwriting (step 5) in that case. The converse (high risk or > €250k leading to manual review) is also misstated as a separate point.  
- The TriVote description is partially correct (noting "any two out of three suffice"), but it lacks precision (e.g., no mention of "record 'Approve'") and is buried in a bloated, irrelevant list.  
Small errors compound: No one-sentence rule per point; instead, it's a numbered narrative of the whole process. This warrants near-total loss for this section (equivalent to ~1.0/5.0 if split evenly).

**Part (b) Assessment (Documents):**  
The list is incomplete and poorly ordered, justifying major points loss. The ground truth has **9** items in first-appearance order, including the three Scorecards as distinct inputs/documents in step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check). The LLM omits all three Scorecards entirely—a critical hallucination by absence, as they are explicitly required. It also collapses "Signed Offer Sheet 77" into a single "Offer Sheet 77" entry, ignoring the ground truth's distinction (unsigned in step 7, signed in step 8). The order is mostly correct for the included items but irrelevant due to omissions. No extraneous documents (e.g., no KYC hallucinations), which prevents a total zero, but incompleteness is a strict demerit (equivalent to ~2.0/5.0).

**Overall Score Calculation:**  
Weighted equally, (1.0 + 2.0)/2 = 1.5, but slight credit for partial TriVote accuracy and no added fabrications bumps to 2.5. Strictness applied: Even minor misinterpretations (e.g., treating steps as decisions) result in outsized penalties, as this response deviates substantially from the concise, accurate ground truth.
