3.0

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision points**
- The LLM fails to restrict its list of decision points to only the process's actual "gates" or conditional branches. Instead, it lists nearly every process step (including ones with no logical/approval decision), demonstrating a misunderstanding.
- The first real decision (risk-based skip/branch) is described **incorrectly** in point #4: "the process skips to manual underwriting" when it should say the opposite—that qualifying cases **skip** manual underwriting. This is a significant error because it inverts the logic of the central conditional branch.
- The description of the TriVote gate (#6) is essentially accurate, but elsewhere the LLM also treats non-decision steps ("Receive-Application", "Assign-Deck-Reviewer", "Prepare-Binding-Offer", etc.) as decision points, which is incorrect and introduces confusion.
- The LLM misses that there are **only two** decision points, and does not provide clear "one-sentence rules" that align exactly with those in the ground truth.
- Therefore, severe content and logical errors are present.

**b) List of required documents**
- The LLM omits several process-required documents:
    - **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** are not listed, even though they are explicit required inputs to the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, and appear early in the process. This is a major omission.
    - "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is also omitted, despite being specifically required during applicant confirmation.
- The order is also incorrect: "Deck Memo" appears before "Offer Sheet 77", but in the process, the three Scorecards should come **after Form 14B and before Deck Memo**.
- All the omitted documents are present in the process description and the ground truth, and thus their absence is a serious fault.
- The inclusion of "Deck Memo" is correct but it also doesn't specify it is only produced in the manual review branch (although the ground truth does not penalize for this nuance).

**General**
- There are no outright hallucinations (e.g., KYC/AML).
- The majority of the answer consists of restating process steps as decision points, which is not in accordance with the user request ("decision point" defined as gates or conditional branches only).
- Omissions and major misstatements have a serious impact on correctness per instructions to be strict.

**Conclusion**
- Due to misunderstandings of what constitutes a "decision point," inversion of the main conditional branch, and omission of multiple required documents, this answer is highly deficient.
- **3.0** is warranted for correctly identifying the existence of at least one proper decision point and listing some correct documents, but the answer is fundamentally flawed.
