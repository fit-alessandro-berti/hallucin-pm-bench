The LLM answer is semantically identical and equally concise, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps (needed for cycle time calculation) and relying solely on event counts. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking explicit reference to the activity name (“Dual Authorization”) and "start-to-completion intervals" (present in ground truth for precision); (2) phrasing "cannot be calculated" vs. "impossible to compute" (slightly less emphatic); (3) not using em dashes or identical structure, per strict wording comparison. No factual errors.
