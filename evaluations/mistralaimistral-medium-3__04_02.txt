6.0

Rationale for scoring:
- R1: Correct (Compliant, correct justification).
- R2: Incorrect (Marked Compliant; actually Violated—Ship_Goods was before final approval after change, so should be Violated).
- R3: Correct (Violated, for correct reason).
- R4: Correct (N/A, right reason).
- R5: Correct (Violated, with appropriate justification).
- R6: Correct (Compliant).

Errors:
- The R2 error is substantial—it is a core process violation (and reversed the compliance conclusion).
- R1 justification is slightly off—Ship_Goods is not mentioned in the rule, but this is a minor technicality.
- Minor issues in justification text (brevity, precise alignment to ground truth wording).

Due to the significant error on a critical rule (R2), and minor issues elsewhere, a strict 6.0 is awarded.
