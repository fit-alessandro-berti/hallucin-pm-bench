4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Strengths**: Correct status and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). R1, R3, R4, R6 match status and are mostly aligned in justification (all ≤20 words, concise).
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - R2: Major error—status incorrectly "Compliant" (should be "Violated"); justification ignores impact of Change_Request resetting approvals, wrongly using original Finance_Approval (2025-03-04) instead of final approval (2025-03-07), violating the 2-day rule post-last approval.
  - R5: Status correct ("Violated"), but justification incomplete—mentions only Ship_Goods, omits Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) as a further processing step before new Manager_Approval (2025-03-07).
- **Overall**: One critical status error (R2) undermines core analysis; partial R5 issue adds deducts. Strict scoring reflects ~67% rule accuracy (4/6 fully correct), with errors causing significant non-compliance misassessment.
