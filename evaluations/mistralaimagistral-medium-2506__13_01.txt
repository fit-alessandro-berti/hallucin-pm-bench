### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth ("1" occurrence). Full points.
- **Question 2**: Exact match, including calculation reference and rounding to "5.56%". Full points.
- **Question 3**: Matches the required listing of case identifier ("A1002"), with only minor wording variance ("is: **A1002**" vs. "Only case **A1002**"). Negligible deduction.
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid sampling-related reasons (small sample size and temporal limitations/bias) that align with ground truth options, stated clearly. However, explanations are less detailed and precise than ground truth examples (e.g., no mention of variance, percentage point impact, or exact time window like "morning"; adds ungrounded "seasonal" inference beyond the log's single-day scope, risking minor hallucination). Significant deduction for brevity and slight overreach (-0.8 total impact).
- **Overall Structure/Compliance**: Answers are derived strictly from log lines, no major hallucinations. Extra closing note is harmless but unnecessary. Strict scoring reflects minor deviations as requested.
