The LLM answer is highly accurate, directly addressing the fact's inaccuracy with evidence from all three cases, mirroring the ground truth's structure and logic (reversed ordering in 1001 and 1003; absence in 1002 disproving "always"). It correctly emphasizes the lack of immediacy in 1003 via the intervening activity, which the ground truth implies but does not explicitly state. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., using timestamps instead of line numbers, slightly more verbose phrasing without bold formatting) and not identically phrasing the conclusion, per strict evaluation criteria. No factual errors or omissions.
