**Evaluation reasoning:**

- **Correct verdict:** The LLM answer correctly judges the fact as inaccurate.
- **Coverage of cases:** The answer only discusses Case 1001 and Case 1003, but omits Case 1002 entirely. This is a significant omission, as Case 1002 is essential to disproving the "always" claim since "Update_Inventory" does not appear at all there.
- **Detail on sequencing:** The LLM states that "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Update_Inventory," which is accurate for Cases 1001 and 1003.
- **Explicitness/detail:** The answer does not explicitly state that in both cited cases the claimed order is reversed, nor does it highlight that there is no instance in all cases of "Authorize_Refund" immediately preceding "Update_Inventory," as the ground-truth does.
- **Justification completeness:** The answer lacks the explicit reasoning that the claim is disproved by even a single counterexample and does not mention that the required sequence never occurs in any case.

**Summary:** The answer is partially complete but not thorough, omits relevant evidence, and lacks some critical explanation and coverage demanded by the prompt and the ground truth. It displays small but significant flaws, especially the omission of Case 1002 and not being clear that the claimed order *never* occurs.
