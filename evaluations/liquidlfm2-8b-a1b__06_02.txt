The LLM answer identifies the first parallel block (P1) but uses incorrect formatting ("and" instead of commas, violating the prompt's explicit instruction). For P2, it omits the third task (CNC_Detailing), listing only a partial set. For P3, it fragments the full set of three concurrent tasks into two incomplete pairwise lines, failing to represent the single parallel block as required. It also fabricates a nonexistent parallel block for sequential tasks (Dry_Fit_Assembly and Glue_And_Clamp), introducing irrelevant and erroneous content. These are major deviations from the ground truth, with no accurate representation of P2 or P3 and added inaccuracies, warranting a low score despite partial recognition of P1.
