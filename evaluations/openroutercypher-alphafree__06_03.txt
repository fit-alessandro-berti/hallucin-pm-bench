7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets from Process B in the proper order, with accurate task names, aligning with the core content of the ground truth. However, it incurs point deductions for: (1) unnecessary introductory phrasing and post-set explanations, which add extraneous details not present in the ground truth and slightly violate the prompt's focus on concise listing; (2) differing formatting (numbered sub-lists instead of inline notation with the â€– symbol for parallelism, and no backticks for task names); (3) omission of the ground truth's closing statement affirming no other parallel tasks; and (4) descriptive labels like "parallel construct" and split references that deviate from the ground truth's "parallel block" phrasing. These stylistic and minor content variances, under strict evaluation, represent avoidable differences warranting a moderate deduction from a perfect score.
