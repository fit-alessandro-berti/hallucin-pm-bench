The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides accurate justifications by citing the relevant CaseIDs (C001, C002, C003, C004) and key activity sequences for the violations (C002 and C004), while noting the compliant cases (C001 and C003). This aligns closely with the ground truth's core content and evidence-based reasoning. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's exhaustive table format and explicit sequence quoting for compliant cases (C001 and C003), which makes it slightly less comprehensive in presentation, though no factual inaccuracies exist.
