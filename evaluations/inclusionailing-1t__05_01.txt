The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, simplicity, and accuracy. Key issues: (1) Introduces unnecessary new elements (parallel gateway, timer catch event, additional flows, boundary on Task_Notify) beyond the ground truth's minimal additions (one timer + one flow), violating the "one improvement" and reuse spirit. (2) Complex parallel setup risks non-interruption of the main path, unlike the ground truth's direct bypassing via interrupting boundary timer. (3) Escalation via Task_Notify (post-Triage) doesn't ensure Triage within 48h; ground truth does by jumping directly. (4) Placement after Task_Check vs. on Task_Receive alters timing logic. (5) Minor: Over-relies on message flows/boundaries without XML details like ground truth's <bpmn:timeDuration>. These errors compound to major non-equivalence.
