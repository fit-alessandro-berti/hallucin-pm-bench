The LLM answer correctly implements the core improvement by adding an interrupting boundary timer on the "Create Account" task with a 48-hour duration equivalent and routing to the existing unused "Account-Manager Review" task, fully complying with the no-new-activities constraint and providing a valid one-sentence justification; however, it loses points for minor strict deviations including using "P2D" instead of the more precise "PT48H" for exactly 48 hours, "tExpression" instead of "tFormalExpression" for the timeDuration type, omitting the boundary event name and explanatory comments present in the ground truth, and a slightly less detailed justification that abbreviates the task name and omits explicit mention of "interrupting" and "pre-existing."
