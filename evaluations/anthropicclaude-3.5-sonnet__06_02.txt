The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names and ordering, adhering to the content requirements (no mentions of A or C, only concurrent tasks). The only minor deviation is the unnecessary introductory sentence ("Looking at Process B only, here are all sets of concurrent tasks:"), which adds extraneous text not present in the ground truth or requested format. Under strict evaluation, this formatting inconsistency warrants a slight deduction, but the core response is otherwise identical.
