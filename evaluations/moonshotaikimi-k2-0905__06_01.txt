The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and core format requirements (`Task_X  â€”  Task_Y` with appropriate spacing around the em dash). The minor visual alignment in the ground truth's second line (extra spaces for monospace-like formatting) is not specified in the prompt and does not constitute an error in the required output structure. No factual inaccuracies or omissions.
