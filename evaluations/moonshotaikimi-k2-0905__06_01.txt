8.0

The LLM answer is nearly correct: it lists exactly the two correct pairs, in the correct alphabetical order, and uses the specified format for the first line.

However, there is a formatting error in the second line:
- In the ground truth, there are two spaces between "Procure_Materials" and the em dash, and two spaces between the em dash and "Schedule_Machines".
- In the LLM answer, only one space is used on both sides of the em dash.

Even minor formatting errors warrant a strict penalty per the instructions. Since all content and pair order is correct but formatting is not strictly followed, substantial points are lost, but not more than 2 (since the result is still clear and otherwise perfect), hence a score of 8.0.
