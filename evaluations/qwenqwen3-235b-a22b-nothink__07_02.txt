8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: three added tasks (by ID), one removed task (by ID), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive. This matches the ground truth in substance, with no factual errors in the core summaries under the required headings. However, under strict evaluation criteria, several differences warrant point deductions:

- **Format and Detail Mismatches (significant deduction: -1.5 points)**: The ground truth uses a numbered list with bolded task names first, followed by IDs in backticks (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"), emphasizing human-readable names. The LLM uses unnumbered bullets with only IDs and backticks, omitting names entirely—this is a notable omission for a "meticulous" analysis, as names provide clearer context without violating "ignore cosmetic renamings." The gateway change lacks the ground truth's precise terminology ("exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)"), using a simpler arrow notation instead.

- **Extra "Notes" Section (moderate deduction: -0.5 points)**: The prompt specifies summarizing "strictly under the three requested headings," but the LLM adds an unrequested "Notes" section with explanations of ignored changes (e.g., name renamings). While informative, this deviates from the exact structure and introduces a small factual inaccuracy (claiming the gateway "retains its name 'Eligibility Check' in v2," when v1 uses "Eligible?"—a renaming that is correctly ignored but misphrased as retention).

- **Overall Structure (minor deduction: -0.0 points)**: Headings match, and completeness is affirmed implicitly, but the ground truth's top-level "## **Expected Answer Key**" and closing note on "no other changes" are absent, slightly reducing polish.

No major errors (e.g., missing changes), so the score stays above 5.0, but strictness penalizes presentation and extras to reflect fidelity to the ground truth.
