9.0

1. The answer "1 time" matches the ground-truth "1 occurrence".  
2. The calculation and percentage value "5.56%" (1 out of 18, rounded) are correct and clearly explained.  
3. Identifies the case as "A1002", matching the required answer.  
4. The two reasons given are (i) small sample size and (ii) temporal bias—both map well to ground-truth points and avoid extra speculation.

Minor deduction:  
- For reason (ii), the answer refers to "a single day's worth of data," which, strictly, is not directly confirmed—though the timestamp range is all on 2025-05-01, the actual duration visible is only part of that day (morning to early afternoon). The ground-truth answer is slightly more precise, referring to both "short time window" and specifically "morning of 1 May 2025". The LLM did not state the precise window or reference morning/partial coverage.

Otherwise, there are no extraneous inferences, hallucinations, or missing information. Small imprecision in the explanation for reason (ii) leads to a strict score of 9.0.
