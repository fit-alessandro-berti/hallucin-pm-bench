9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (1 occurrence, no differences). Full points.
- **Question 2**: Exact match in value (5.56%) and calculation basis (1/18). Minor formatting difference (no space before % in LLM), but content identical. Full points.
- **Question 3**: Substantively correct (identifies A1002 as the only case). Minor phrasing difference: LLM uses singular "the case identifier... is A1002" without explicitly saying "only," which slightly reduces emphasis on exclusivity as in ground truth. Deduct 0.2 points for precision.
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid, clear sampling-related reasons that align conceptually with ground truth examples (small sample size via single instance insufficiency; temporal bias via single-day coverage). However, lacks the depth/specificity of ground truth elaborations (e.g., no mention of variance, percentage point change, or exact time window like "morning of 1 May 2025"â€”LLM's "single day's worth" is accurate but less precise). This is a small but notable shortfall in elaboration under strict criteria. Deduct 0.3 points.

Overall score reflects high fidelity to ground truth with only minor phrasing/detail gaps; no hallucinations or inferences beyond log data.
