The LLM answer accurately lists all required documents with exact matches to the specified terminology and no introductions of standard loan terms. However, it incompletely summarizes the decision points by omitting the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as the third key decision (where the board explicitly votes approve or reject), reducing coverage from three to two points. Minor structural differences (e.g., lacking sequence context like "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") further detract under strict evaluation, though phrasing is otherwise faithful.
