**Score: 7.0**

**Rationale for Scoring:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM answer lists the correct required documents, matching the ground truth with exact names and order.
- It describes the two major decision points: Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision, with their logic and the outcome paths clearly explained.
- It uses the correct process/step names (e.g., Underwriter Alignment Gate, Neighbourhood Feedback Check), as specified in the prompt.

**Key Issues and Deductions:**
1. **Omission of a Decision Point (-2.0):**
   - The answer omits the third clear decision point: **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** board vote. In the process, this is a distinct and critical decision, and it's specified in the ground truth. Its absence is a significant procedural oversight.
   
2. **Imprecise Sequencing/Context (-0.5):**
   - The decision point descriptions do not explicitly mention that Underwriter Alignment Gate happens after Dual Underwriter Split, or that Amount Threshold Decision is after Neighbourhood Feedback Check. While the logic is implied, the exact placement (which the prompt stresses) is not crisply stated.

3. **Explanatory Detail (-0.5):**
   - The answer doesn’t explicitly mention there’s *no need for additional/standard documents* as a point of clarification (not essential, but it's included in the ground truth and expected for maximal accuracy/completeness).

**Summary:**  
The answer is fundamentally solid in content coverage but misses a critical decision point (Final Micro-loan Board Approval), and doesn’t perfectly reflect sequencing/context as requested, so under strict grading, a **7.0** is warranted.
