7.0

R1: Correct.
R2: Incorrect justificationâ€”the LLM incorrectly hinges the 2-day rule on the last approval before the Change_Request, failing to recognize that a new Manager_Approval after Change_Request resets the approval point. The Ship_Goods event happens before the post-Change_Request Manager_Approval, making the rule violated for a stronger reason than just the >2 days (Ship_Goods is not after *all required* approvals).
R3: Correct.
R4: Correct.
R5: Correct.
R6: Correct.

Main errors:
- R2 justification is factually incorrect and demonstrates a misunderstanding of rule logic and event sequence.
- The R2 error alone costs significant points, as it misconstrues a key rule's trigger and timing.
- Short justifications sometimes lack clarity but remain within instructions.
- Final structure and compliance status correct.

Hence, significant point loss for R2; otherwise, the answer tracks the ground truth and is concise and clear, warranting a moderate score of 7.0.
