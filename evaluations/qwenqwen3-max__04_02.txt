The LLM answer correctly identifies all rule statuses and the overall NON-COMPLIANT result, matching the ground truth. However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions are warranted for flawed justifications: R2 incorrectly bases timing on the initial Finance_Approval (03-04) instead of the final post-change Manager_Approval (03-07), misrepresenting the violation (Ship_Goods precedes it, not merely exceeding 2 days); even the 1-day calculation is miscast as "2 days after" without explaining why violated. R5 justification is incomplete, omitting Pay_Invoice as a further processing step before new approval. Other justifications are minor paraphrases but align; these core errors in reasoning for R2 and R5 reflect substantial differences from ground truth, costing full credit on accuracy and insight.
