4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Compliant (minor wording differences, but accurate; full points).
- **R2**: Major error in justification—incorrectly states Ship_Goods (Mar 5) >2 days after initial approval (Mar 4), which is factually wrong (it's 1 day, compliant if ignoring change); fails to account for new approval on Mar 7 as "last required" per R5 interplay, leading to flawed violation reasoning (significant deduction).
- **R3**: Accurate (full points).
- **R4**: Minor wording differences, but accurate (near full points).
- **R5**: Partial accuracy—correctly identifies violation and notes missing approval before Ship_Goods, but incomplete by omitting Pay_Invoice (also before new approval on Mar 7); misses full scope of "further processing steps" (significant deduction).
- **R6**: Accurate (full points).
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but lacks GT's specificity on violations (R2, R3, R5); format adheres to prompt but lacks table (minor, as not required).
- **Strictness Applied**: Errors in R2 (factual/timing inaccuracy) and R5 (incompleteness) are not small— they reflect flawed rule interpretation and trace analysis, warranting ~40% point loss from a perfect 10.0. Justifications stay ≤20 words, but accuracy is prioritized.
