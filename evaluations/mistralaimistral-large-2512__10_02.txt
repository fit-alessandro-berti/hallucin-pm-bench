**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in nearly every aspect, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Structure mismatch**: 3 role columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support) vs. ground truth's 4 (adds Operations Manager). No inclusion of the critical "Operations Manager" role dominating **A** assignments.
- **Task rows mismatch**: 8 rows (including extras like "Ensures the SWIFT message is sent" and "Notifies the Regulatory Liaison") vs. ground truth's exact 6. Wording differs (e.g., "Receives and logs the customer’s transfer instruction in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archives the case file" vs. "Archive Record"). No row is identical.
- **RACI assignments mismatch**: Zero rows have matching assignments across all cells. Examples:
  | Task example | LLM | Ground Truth | Diff |
  |--------------|-----|--------------|------|
  | Receive | R (Analyst) only | **R** Analyst, I Liaison, **A** Ops, C IT | Missing I/C/A/IT entirely |
  | Screen | R Analyst, C Liaison | **R** Analyst, **A** Liaison, I Ops, C IT | C vs **A** Liaison; missing Ops/IT |
  | **KYC Review** | R Liaison only | C Analyst, **R** Liaison, **A** Ops, I IT | Missing C/A/IT |
  | Approve | A Liaison only | C Analyst, **R** Liaison, **A** Ops, I IT | A vs **R**; missing all else |
  | Release | R Analyst, C Liaison | **R** Analyst, I Liaison, **A** Ops, C IT | C vs I Liaison |
  | Archive | C Liaison, R IT | C Analyst, I Liaison, **A** Ops, **R** IT | Wrong C (Liaison vs Analyst); missing Ops |
- **Formatting errors**: No bolding on **R/A/C/I** or "**KYC Review**"; simpler header ("Task" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"); "Key" vs. "Legend"; added unrequested explanation note absent in ground truth.
- **Coverage/omissions**: Splits source steps into non-ground-truth tasks (e.g., separate SWIFT/notify); incomplete RACI logic (many rows lack **A**; e.g., screening has R but no A).
- **Vocabulary/mandate**: Technically complies (uses mandated terms), but fails to replicate ground truth's exact phrasing/header/emphasis.

Every difference, including small ones (wording, bolding, legend), compounds to total non-equivalence.
