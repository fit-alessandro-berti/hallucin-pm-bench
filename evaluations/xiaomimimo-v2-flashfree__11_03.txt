5.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring breakdown):
- **Activity selection (core requirement, 40% weight)**: Identifies Legal Approval and Risk Review correctly (top 2 by joint SLA breach + waiting time: +300s/600s and +300s/480s). **Major error**: Picks Verify Identity (+30s/80s) instead of Credit Assessment (+60s/200s), which has higher breach *and* 2.5x waiting time—clearly the #3 worst jointly. -2.0 points.
- **SLA exceedance quantification (20% weight)**: Accurate for selected activities (e.g., +300s, +300s, +30s) and includes waiting times grounded in table. Minor phrasing ("exceeds the X s SLA by Y s") matches intent. No invention. +1.8/2.0.
- **Recommendations (20% weight)**: Uses bullets as required (+), one per activity, attempts data-driven (e.g., targets reductions tied to excesses like 300s or halve 480s). **Errors**: Semi-invented actions ("cut rework," "validation checks upstream," "~40 s band") not directly from data; vague/not concrete like ground truth. -0.6 points (net 1.4/2.0).
- **Structure & format (10% weight)**: Memo-like title; bullets only for recs (complies); intro grounds jointly in data. **Errors**: Lacks formal To/From/Subject; no bolding; casual header "Recommended actions, data-driven:"; ~120 words (under 150). Differs significantly from ground truth polish. -0.6/1.0.
- **Fidelity to rules/no invention (10% weight)**: Stays to table data/metrics/activities; no absent items. Minor intro phrasing ok. No extraneous metrics (unlike ground truth's invented "4 805 cases"/"35 %"). +0.8/1.0.

**Total: 5.2/10.0**. Substantial content deviation (wrong activity) and polish gaps outweigh accuracies; strict penalty per instructions.
