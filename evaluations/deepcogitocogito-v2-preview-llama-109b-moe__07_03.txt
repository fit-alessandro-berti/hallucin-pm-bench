9.5

The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth, correctly identifying all added and removed tasks and all gateway type changes, with task IDs and names presented as instructed.

Strict deductions for:

- Formatting: There is a minor inconsistency; in "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES", the ground truth aligns the output `Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel`, adding whitespace for alignment. The LLM answer omits this alignment. Although this is a minor formatting detail, strict marking as requested means it must be penalized.
- The LLM included an introductory paragraph and reasoning not present in the requested output, although the final output block matches the correct structure. As the instructions are to output "only the three required headings and the concrete differences", this violates the constraints for extraneous content.

Therefore, the answer receives a 9.5.
