The LLM answer includes substantial extraneous commentary and reasoning at the beginning, which directly violates the prompt's strict instruction to output *only* the three required headings and concrete differences, with no commentary. This alone warrants a significant deduction, as it constitutes a major structural and adherence failure. The structured section is nearly identical to the ground truth in content (correctly identifying all added tasks, the removed task, and both gateway changes with proper IDs, names, and type formats), but minor formatting issues persist: extra newlines after headings, lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway line (ground truth uses spaces for columnar alignment: "- Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel"), and inconsistent spacing around elements. Under strict evaluation, even these small formatting discrepancies compound the loss, though the core verifiable differences are accurate. Overall, the response fails to fully match the ground truth due to the polluting preamble and subtle presentation errors.
