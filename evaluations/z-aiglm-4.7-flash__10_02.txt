**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Vocabulary mandate violations (-2.5 points)**: Used forbidden "compliance officer" in task description (step 6), despite strict "never 'Compliance Officer'" rule. Did not fully reword to mandated terms like ground truth's "Archive Record".
- **Table structure/format differences (-2.0 points)**: Uses Task | R/A/C/I columns with roles in cells (functional format). Ground truth uses roles as columns | Task rows with R/A/C/I in cells. No "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header phrasing, no **Legend**, different title/emphasis (e.g., no bolded **KYC Review**).
- **Task wording/granularity differences (-1.5 points)**: Not precisely matched (e.g., "Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; combined "Release payment and ensure SWIFT message is sent" vs. separate "Release Payment"; "Archive case file and notify..." vs. "Archive Record"). Omits full mapping fidelity.
- **Roles differences (-1.0 points)**: Missing "Operations Manager" (present in all ground truth assignments). Uses only TA/RL/IT Support.
- **RACI assignments mismatches (-2.0 points)**: Almost no alignment (e.g., Receive: LLM TA-R/RL-A vs. ground TA-R/Ops-A/RL-I/IT-C; Screen: partial TA-R/RL-A match but misses Ops-I/IT-C; KYC: LLM RL-R/A vs. ground RL-R/Ops-A/TA-C/IT-I; etc.). Many empty cells vs. ground truth's complete per-role assignments. Over-relies on RL as A everywhere.
- **Other (coverage/omissions, +1.0 partial credit)**: Covers all 6 source steps in Markdown table, correctly maps core mandated terms (TA, RL, "KYC Review") for most activities/roles, no additions/substitutions beyond source except minor.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 3.0 for cumulative major/strict failures. Not a close match despite basic effort.
