4.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization, and avoids all forbidden terms. The overall table structure is present (activities as rows, roles as columns), with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. The activities list matches the ground truth in sequence and naming (minor deduction for adding numbers like "1.", "2.", which ground truth omits).
- **Major Weaknesses (significant deductions)**: 
  - **RACI assignments**: Substantial mismatches across nearly every cell, deviating from the ground truth and failing to "reflect the narrative" as per the rubric. Examples:
    - Receive Application: CO is "I" (vs. ground truth "C"); FC and IT blank (vs. "I").
    - KYC Review: AM "C" (vs. "A"); CO "R/A" (vs. "R"); FC blank (vs. "C"); IT blank (vs. "I").
    - Order Vetting: FC and IT blank (vs. "I").
    - Payment Clearance: AM "C" (vs. "A"); CO blank (vs. "C"); FC "R/A" (vs. "R"); IT "C" (vs. "I"). Note: Each activity must have exactly one "Responsible" per narrative/rubric, but LLM inconsistently combines "R/A" where ground truth separates or simplifies.
    - Record Update: AM "I" (vs. "C"); CO blank (vs. "I"); IT "R/A" (vs. "R").
    - Notify Customer: IT blank (vs. "I").
    These are not minor; they alter accountability and consultation flows, leading to ~70% cell-level inaccuracies.
  - **Formatting inconsistencies**: Headers include abbreviations "(AM)", "(CO)", etc. (ground truth uses full names only). No bolding on primary assignments or preferred-term activities (ground truth uses **bold** strategically). Blanks are used instead of explicit "I" or "C" where required, implying omissions.
  - **Unwarranted content**: Includes explanatory "Key Notes" section with inferences (e.g., "AM consults CO for KYC results", "FC is consulted during Record Update") not present in ground truth, adding unsubstantiated details and violating "No extra... content" in rubric. This introduces self-justification not requested.
- **Strictness applied**: Per instructions, even small errors (e.g., blanks vs. explicit "I", combined "R/A" vs. separated) result in outsized penalties. Core RACI purpose (mapping responsibilities per narrative) is undermined by pervasive differences, justifying a low score despite terminology accuracy. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, ~40% alignment on content warrants 4.2.
