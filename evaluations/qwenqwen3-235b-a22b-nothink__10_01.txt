7.0

**Detailed Evaluation:**

### Terminology and Vocabulary
- All mandated preferred terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are used—with the correct spelling and capitalization.
- None of the forbidden terms are present.
- ✅ Full marks for terminology adherence.

### RACI Structure: Activities/Rows and Roles/Columns
- All activities and roles match those in the ground truth.
- No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced.
- ✅ Full marks for structure.

### RACI Assignments: **Major Flaws Noted**
Now, comparing the specific RACI allocations for each row:

#### 1. Receive Application
- **LLM:** AM (R/A), CO (I), FC (), IT ()
- **Ground Truth:** AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I)
- Errors:
  - Leaves FC and IT blank (should be I on both).
  - CO is I, but should be C.

#### 2. KYC Review
- **LLM:** AM (C), CO (R/A), FC (), IT ()
- **Ground Truth:** AM (A), CO (R), FC (C), IT (I)
- Errors:
  - AM is C, should be A.
  - IT and FC are blank, but should be C (FC) and I (IT).

#### 3. Order Vetting
- **LLM:** AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (), IT ()
- **Ground Truth:** AM (R/A), CO (C), FC (I), IT (I)
- Errors:
  - FC and IT missing ('I' for both in ground truth).

#### 4. Payment Clearance
- **LLM:** AM (C), CO (), FC (R/A), IT (C)
- **Ground Truth:** AM (A), CO (C), FC (R), IT (I)
- Errors:
  - AM is C not A.
  - CO is blank, should be C.
  - IT is C, should be I.

#### 5. Record Update
- **LLM:** AM (I), CO (), FC (C), IT (R/A)
- **Ground Truth:** AM (C), CO (I), FC (C), IT (R)
- Errors:
  - AM is I, should be C.
  - CO is blank, should be I.

#### 6. Notify Customer
- **LLM:** AM (R/A), CO (I), FC (I), IT ()
- **Ground Truth:** AM (R/A), CO (I), FC (I), IT (I)
- Error:
  - IT is blank; should be I.

### Conventions
- Uses "R/A", but in ground truth "R/A" appears only for AM, otherwise separated. Not a major error, but slight mismatch.

### Explanatory Notes
- No problematic over-explaining, though the "Key Notes" introduce some interpretive explanations, but do not detract.

### Severity/Strictness (per rubric)
- **Every cell deviation is a significant deduction.**
- Numerous inaccuracies in the R, A, C, I allocations (multiple omissions, wrong attributions). Every row has at least one error.

---

**Summary:**  
While the answer is structurally correct and follows vocabulary policies perfectly (which are requirements for any passing grade), the RACI allocations do not faithfully match the ground truth, omitting several "I" and "C" assignments and sometimes swapping A/C. These are major process-mapping errors that would mislead a downstream implementer and must be marked down severely.

**Therefore: 7.0**  
- Points retained for term compliance and structure.
- -3 points for the high number of RACI misattributions and omissions across nearly all rows.
