9.0

The LLM answer is accurate and covers the crucial points:

- It correctly answers "No" to the question.
- It explicitly cites all four relevant cases and describes their sequences.
- It uses clear bullet points to show both where the pattern "holds" and "does not hold."
- The reasoning is clear: it notes two cases (C002, C004) where an additional activity intervenes.

Areas where the answer is slightly less rigorous than the ground truth (hence losing a point):

- The answer does not use a tabular structure as in the ground truth, making the justification slightly less systematic and quick to check.
- The explanation for C001 and C003 could explicitly state "immediate successor" for consistency.
- It omits the explicit statement that "Because two out of four cases violate the rule, the claim is inaccurate," although this is strongly implied.

Overall, there are only minor presentation shortcomings, and the content is otherwise complete and correct: **9.0**.
