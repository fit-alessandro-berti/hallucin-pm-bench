8.0

The LLM answer is overall accurate in both decision ("No") and justification. It correctly analyzes all four cases, explicitly identifying where "Validate_Payment" is not immediately after "Receive_Order" and provides the relevant sequences. However, compared to the ground truth, it does not clearly mark which sequences conform or violate the FACT in a tabular/structured form, nor does it *explicitly* state the "two out of four cases" summary, which strengthens the conclusiveness of the answer.

Point deductions:
-1.0: The justification does not use a concise or structured comparison format as in the ground truth, missing an opportunity for higher clarity.
-1.0: The answer does not specifically count or highlight that "two out of four cases violate the stated rule" or offer explicit notes for each case.

Otherwise, the factual reasoning, case-by-case evidence, and final conclusion are correct.
