The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides an accurate case-by-case justification with precise sequences from the log, citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001â€“C004) and highlighting the counterexamples (C002 and C004) that disprove the "always" claim. No factual errors or omissions in sequences or logic. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: less structured format (bullet list vs. ground truth's table with columns/emojis for clarity) and slightly more casual phrasing (e.g., "immediate here, but not sufficient to claim 'always'"), which reduce precision in presentation under strict evaluation.
