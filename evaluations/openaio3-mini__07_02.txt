8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and summarizes all relevant changes under the exact required headings, matching the ground truth in core content: three added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), one removed task (Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway-type change (from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision). It ignores cosmetic elements (e.g., name changes, flow renumbering) as instructed, with no extraneous additions or omissions.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Formatting inconsistencies (significant deduction: -1.0)**: Uses bullet points with ID-first order and quoted names, while ground truth uses numbered lists, bolded names first, and backticked IDs. Headings lack bolding/italics, and the final clarifying note ("No other...") is absent.
- **Phrasing in Gateway-type changes (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Describes as "Exclusive Gateway to an Inclusive Gateway" (aligns with prompt example), but omits ground truth's added details like "(XOR)", "(OR)", and explicit "in *v1* to ... in *v2*".
These small differences in presentation and precision result in a high but not perfect score, as content accuracy is near-exact.
