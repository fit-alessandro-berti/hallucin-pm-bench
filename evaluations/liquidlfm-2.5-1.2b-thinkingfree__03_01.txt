**1.0**

The LLM answer is invalid BPMN 2.0 XML and fails to model the process accurately:

- **Structural errors** (fatal): Lacks required `xmlns`, `<process>`, `sequenceFlow`s, `startEvent`, `endEvent`. Uses non-existent `<node>` elements. Invalid child structure under `<definitions>`.
- **Missing elements** (all critical): No "Provide Reset Instructions" (t2), "Initial Diagnosis" (t3), second exclusiveGateway (gw2), "Forward to Specialist" (t5), proper "Resolve Issue" (t4 after gw2), specialist flow to resolve.
- **Incomplete logic**: Single gateway (g1) instead of two (gw1/gw2). No conditions (e.g., `yes`/`no` expressions). Loop only vaguely as "Loop" node (t6), not back to t3 via gw3→t3 (f13).
- **Naming mismatches**: "Classified" ≠ "Auto-Classification"; "Resolve"/"Forward"/"Confirm"/"Loop" ≠ spec names; no "Password Reset?" label.
- **Invalid syntax**: Lowercase `<exclusive-gateway>`; no `sourceRef`/`targetRef`; exceeds "exactly as stated" by inventing "Decision 1"/"Loop".
- **Non-functional**: Cannot parse as BPMN; <40 lines due to truncation, not conciseness.

Zero adherence to prompt/ground truth; full deduction.
