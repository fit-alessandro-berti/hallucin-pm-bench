The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in core content (exact same XML modification in the diff hunk, targeting the critical P5D to P2D change on the same task), with a functionally equivalent one-sentence rationale explaining the SLA benefit. Minor deductions for: (1) extraneous unified diff headers (`--- a/onboarding.bpmn +++ b/onboarding.bpmn`) and filename invention not present in ground truth or original XML; (2) slightly non-standard @@ placement (missing closing @@); (3) rationale wording differences (lacks bolded task name, "contractual 3-day SLA" specificity—possibly inferred but unstated in prompt—and explicit "without introducing any new activities" rule reinforcement); (4) output headers (**Unified diff**/**Rationale**) vs. ground truth's (### Diff/### Rationale), diverging slightly from prompt's numbered "1./2." format. These are small formatting/verbosity issues under utmost strictness, warranting a 1.0-point loss from perfection.
