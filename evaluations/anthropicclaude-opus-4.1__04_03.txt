4.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses Rules 2, 3, and 4, including the key violation in Rule 3 due to NA preceding RA. However, it commits a significant error by incorrectly violating Rule 1: the relative order of QE before RA is preserved (NA in between does not break "in that order," as confirmed by the ground truth), leading to an overstated justification of violations. This misinterpretation of sequencing undermines the rule-by-rule analysis, warranting a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., no table) are negligible compared to the content error.
