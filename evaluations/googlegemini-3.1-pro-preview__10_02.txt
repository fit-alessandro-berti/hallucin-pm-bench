**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary adherence (mandated terms)**: Perfect match (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst used exclusively where required). No deductions here (+).
- **Table format**: Markdown table present and clear, covers process steps. Minor structure differences (ID column, bolding) are small errors but deduct points per strictness rule (-0.5).
- **Task coverage and wording**: 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6; splits step 5 (release + SWIFT) and adds "transaction case file" phrasing not matching ground truth exactly (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. "Receive transfer instruction and log"; "Archive Record" vs. "Archive the transaction case file"). Omits/ignores notification as separate but infers it. Significant mismatches (-2.0).
- **Roles/Columns**: Uses only source-derived roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support); **missing Operations Manager** (present in every ground truth row), a critical omission (-1.5).
- **RACI assignments**: Fundamentally divergent across nearly all cells (e.g., Task 1: LLM TA R/A vs. GT TA R/RL I/OM A/IT C; Task 3: LLM RL R/A vs. GT C/RL R/OM A/IT I; extras like Task 4 I, Task 7). Only partial overlap on ~20% (e.g., Task 2 TA R/RL A). Core content failure (-3.0).
- **Extra content**: Unrequested intro, explanations, and detailed RACI key (ground truth has minimal legend only). Violates "create a RACI table" focus (-0.5).
- **Overall fidelity**: High differences in structure, content, and assignments outweigh vocab compliance. Strict penalty for all variances yields low score.
