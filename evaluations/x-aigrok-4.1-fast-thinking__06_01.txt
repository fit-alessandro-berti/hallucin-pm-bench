**9.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can execute in parallel (per Process B's description), lists them in proper alphabetical order both within pairs (C<Q, P<S) and overall (C-pair before P-pair), and uses the specified format with one pair per line and "  —  " spacing around the em dash. 

Minor deductions for:
- Missing markdown code block (```) used in ground truth (-0.5).
- Exact spacing mismatch in second line: ground truth aligns the em dash with extra spaces ("Procure_Materials     —"), while LLM uses uniform "  — " (-0.5).

No content errors, no extra/missing pairs, fully adheres to prompt constraints (ignores Process A, only Process B).
