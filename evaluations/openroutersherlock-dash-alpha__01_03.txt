8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
**Part (a): 9.5/10**  
The LLM accurately identifies both decision points and summarizes their rules concisely in one sentence each, closely matching the ground truth in content and logic. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "skip Manual-Underwriting-Review (step 5); otherwise, proceed to step 5" vs. ground truth's "bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise it proceeds to that review," and omission of explicit "record 'Approve'" phrasing, though implied by "approvals"). Naming variations ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check conditional branch" vs. "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check") are present but do not alter the rule's meaning. No hallucinations or extraneous details.

**Part (b): 6.5/10**  
The list is mostly accurate in order and inclusion of core documents (Form 14B, scorecards, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025), with no hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML items). However, it significantly omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (first appearing in step 8, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7), resulting in an incomplete list of 8 items instead of 9. This is a clear error in exhaustiveness, as the process explicitly lists "Signed Offer Sheet 77" alongside "ID Matrix Declaration" in step 8. The order is otherwise correct, but the omission disrupts full fidelity to the ground truth.

**Overall Score Justification**: Weighted average reflecting strict criteria—strong on (a) but penalized heavily for the substantive omission in (b), which fails to capture "all documents" as required. No other major deviations, but completeness is non-negotiable.
