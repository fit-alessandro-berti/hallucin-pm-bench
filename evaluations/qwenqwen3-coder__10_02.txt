3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt's requirements but deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, roles, task coverage, and RACI assignments, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Roles (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: The prompt mandates using only specified terms ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") and implies sticking to source roles (e.g., IT Support). However, the ground truth includes an additional "Operations Manager" column for accountability, which the LLM omits entirely. This results in incomplete RACI coverage, as many "A" assignments in the ground truth (e.g., for KYC Review, Approve, Release) are missing or reassigned incorrectly. IT Support is present but underutilized compared to the ground truth.

- **Task Coverage and Wording (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM covers all source steps but unnecessarily splits them into 8 rows (e.g., separate "Ensure SWIFT message transmission" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archived case"), introducing unsubstantiated details like Transaction Analyst as "R" for notification (not in source text). The ground truth consolidates into 6 precise rows without extras. Wording mismatches include "Conduct KYC Review" (adds "Conduct"; ground truth uses exact mandated "**KYC Review**") and verbose phrasings like "Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction". No omissions, but additions and lack of mandated bolding for "KYC Review" count as errors.

- **RACI Assignments (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: Several align partially (e.g., Transaction Analyst "R" for Receive and Screen; Regulatory Liaison "R" for KYC Review), but many differ due to missing Operations Manager (e.g., Screen has Regulatory "C" in LLM vs. "A" in ground truth; Archive has no "C" for Transaction Analyst). Approve shifts "A" to Regulatory Liaison (LLM) vs. "R" for Regulatory and "A" for Operations (ground truth). IT Support roles are approximate but inconsistent (e.g., "I" everywhere in LLM for early steps vs. "C" in ground truth).

- **Formatting and Clarity (minor deduction: -0.5 point)**: Markdown table is used, but the LLM adds an unnecessary title, full "Key" explanations (vs. ground truth's abbreviated "Legend"), and bolding inconsistent with mandated terms. Ground truth is more streamlined and directly matches the "organise clearly" directive without extras.

Positive aspects (partial credit): Correct use of mandated vocabulary where applicable (e.g., no forbidden terms like "Compliance Officer" or "CDD"), full source mapping without inventions beyond splits, and clear Markdown. However, cumulative differences (especially structural) make it a poor match to the ground truth, reflecting significant fidelity loss. A perfect score would require near-identical table structure, roles, wording, and assignments.
