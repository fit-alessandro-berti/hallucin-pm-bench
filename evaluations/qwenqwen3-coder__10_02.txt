5.0

**Rationale:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer adheres to the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and avoids forbidden terms, which is critical, and uses the required Markdown format.
- All main process steps are present (with minor variations/expansion).
- Tasks are mapped to the correct roles using the RACI framework format.

**Significant Issues and Deductions:**

1. **Omission of “Operations Manager”:**  
   - The ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a column, who is Accountable (A) for almost every activity, except for some where Regulatory Liaison is A.  
   - The absence of this role is a significant deviation (-1.5 points).

2. **Error in RACI Mapping for “Accountable”:**
   - With "Accountable" incorrectly assigned: the LLM assigns A to "Regulatory Liaison" for "Approve high-risk transactions" (correct), but not to the necessary steps where "Operations Manager" is accountable in the ground truth.
   - In the LLM answer, several steps lack an "A" or have it inconsistently mapped, leading to lack of clarity on ultimate responsibility for activities (-1.0 point).

3. **Inaccurate/Extraneous Task Breakdown:**  
   - The LLM splits some steps further (e.g., "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archived case" is not an explicit ground-truth activity); this is an unnecessary expansion and distracts from direct mapping (-0.5 points).
   - Conversely, the LLM includes "Ensure SWIFT message transmission" but does not map to "Release Payment" as in the ground truth, and omits "Archive Record" in favor of "Archive case file".

4. **RACI Column Errors:**
   - “KYC Review” and “Screen Against Sanctions List” have mismatched Responsible and Accountable roles versus ground truth. For instance, "Screen payment against sanctions list" in ground truth: TA is R, RL is A; in LLM: TA is R, RL is C, IT Support is I (incorrect) (-1.0 point).

5. **Mandated Wording for Activities:**  
   - Some step names do not strictly follow the ground truth's activity naming with mandated wording (e.g., “KYC Review”, “Release Payment”, “Archive Record”). LLM’s versions are close but not always exact or consistent (-0.5 point).

6. **Legibility Clarity:**  
   - Key and layout are clear.

**Conclusion:**  
This answer contains substantial positive elements but deviates from the ground truth in role coverage, the accuracy of RACI allocations, step names, and fails to include all necessary columns. Each error is significant for strict process documentation. **Score: 5.0**
