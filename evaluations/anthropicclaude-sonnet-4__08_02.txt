The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Question 1 (claims "No" instead of "Yes"), provides no valid firing sequence, and its explanation misrepresents token flow constraints (ignores the independent path via T2-T7-T4 to enable T5 without firing T3). This inverts the core conclusion and contradicts the ground truth entirely, warranting the minimum score.
