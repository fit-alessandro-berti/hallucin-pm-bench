3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially identifies key elements but contains significant inaccuracies, rambling explanations, and deviations from the strict requirements, leading to a low score under utmost strictness:

- **Structure and Strictness (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: The response uses the exact headings but includes verbose, speculative reasoning (e.g., "renamed to Task_VerifyIdentity — no, renamed..."; "logic fragmented"; "conceptually removed") that violates the "summarise *all* changes" instruction by adding interpretive analysis instead of factual listings. It ignores the "strictly under the three requested headings" by blending unrelated details (e.g., name changes, flow logic). Ground truth is concise and list-based; this is disorganized and exceeds scope.

- **Added Tasks (partial credit, but deduction for errors: +2.0 base, -1.0)**: Correctly lists the three added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject) matching ground truth. However, prefixes with incorrect claims (e.g., confusing Task_ApproveLoan as renamed to Task_VerifyIdentity; implying replacements of non-tasks). This introduces false equivalencies and errors, significantly deviating from ground truth's clean, factual enumeration.

- **Removed Tasks (major error: +0.5 base, -2.5)**: Fundamentally incorrect—claims both Task_ApproveLoan and Task_RejectLoan are removed, but ground truth specifies *only* Task_RejectLoan as removed (Task_ApproveLoan persists, merely renamed cosmetically, which should be ignored). This is a critical mismatch, inventing a removal and ignoring the prompt's directive to exclude renamings. Explanations further err by referencing "inline task flow" and "semantically in context," which are not structural changes.

- **Gateway-Type Changes (minor credit, deduction for extras: +1.5 base, -0.5)**: Correctly identifies the type change (exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway) for Gateway_Decision, aligning with ground truth's XOR to OR description. However, includes irrelevant name change ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check"), which the prompt explicitly says to ignore as cosmetic. This adds unneeded detail, reducing fidelity.

Overall, while ~60% of core facts (added tasks, gateway type) align, the removal error is substantive (altering the change summary), and the non-strict, error-laden presentation amplifies differences. No credit for completeness without accuracy; strictness penalizes even phrasing issues heavily.
