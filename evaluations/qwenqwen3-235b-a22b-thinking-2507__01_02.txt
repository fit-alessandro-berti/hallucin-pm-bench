6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is mostly accurate in identifying the core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing the required documents without introducing prohibited standard loan terminology. However, under strict evaluation criteria, several issues warrant significant deductions:

- **Decision Points (major deductions for verbosity and additions):** 
  - Unnecessarily verbose: Expands into detailed "Branch:" sub-bullets with procedural flows (e.g., "Proceed to Step 6", "Proceed to Step 9"), step number references (e.g., "(Step 5)"), and extra inferences (e.g., "Process terminates (rejection not further defined)"), which deviate from the ground truth's concise "*If... ⇒ continue/escalate*" format and positional context (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"). This introduces non-exact summary elements, inflating the response beyond a strict summary.
  - Phrasing mismatches: Uses "differ by > 2 points" instead of exact "differ by ≤ 2" logic mirror; adds "loan amount" (minor but counts as non-exact terminology per strictness).

- **Required Documents (moderate deductions for phrasing and formatting):**
  - Close match but small wording variances: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's "(≤ 3 months)"; "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" (adds "single" which aligns with prompt but mismatches ground truth exactly); "Community Impact Statement (CIS template)" vs. "(CIS)" (extra "template").
  - Formatting inconsistencies: Bullet list with selective bolding (e.g., **ML-APP-01**) vs. ground truth's plain numbered list; note adds "branch-manager approvals" not in ground truth, altering the exact exclusion phrasing.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (minor but cumulative deductions):**
  - Headers use "###" vs. ground truth's "####"; extra separator ("---") and italicized note not mirroring ground truth.
  - Fails perfect fidelity: ~20% deviation in conciseness and exactness, with additions that, while not wrong, exceed the prompt's "summarise" and "exact terminology" mandates.

A perfect 10.0 requires identical structure, phrasing, and zero extras/variances; this is strong but flawed, justifying 6.5.
