**Assessment:**

- **Terminology:**  
  - The required synonyms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are present and correct. No forbidden terms used.

- **RACI Assignments:**  
  - The LLM answer gets several allocations wrong compared to the ground truth:
    - **Receive Application:**  
      - LLM does *not* assign "I" to Finance Clerk or IT Support (ground truth does).
      - LLM omits "C" for Compliance Officer (ground truth includes "C").
    - **KYC Review:**  
      - LLM gives "R/A" to Compliance Officer and "I" to Account Manager.
      - Should be: "R" for Compliance Officer, "A" for Account Manager, "C" for Finance Clerk, "I" for IT Support.
    - **Order Vetting:**  
      - LLM gives "R/A" to Account Manager and "I" to Finance Clerk only.
      - Missing "C" for Compliance Officer, "I" for IT Support, and incorrectly only "I" for FC.
    - **Payment Clearance:**  
      - LLM gives "R/A" to Finance Clerk, "I" to IT Support.
      - Ground truth also assigns "A" to Account Manager, "C" to Compliance Officer, "I" to IT Support, but also "C" for CO.
    - **Record Update:**  
      - LLM: "I" for Account Manager, "R/A" for IT.
      - Ground truth: "C" for AM, "I" for CO, "C" for FC, "R" for IT.
    - **Notify Customer:**  
      - LLM: "R/A" for Account Manager only.
      - Ground truth: "R/A" for AM, "I" for CO, FC, and IT.
  - Several "Consulted" (C) designations are missing throughout.

- **Formatting / Completeness:**  
  - There are claims at the end ("All activities strictly use preferred terminology...") which add no extra forbidden content, but this is not penalized.
  - The "C" role is declared 'not used,' but that is explicitly incorrect per ground truth.

**Summary:**  
This answer does meet the strict terminology requirements, does not introduce extra tasks or roles, but nevertheless has multiple RACI errors (missing many "C"s and "I"s, and sometimes over-merges roles as "R/A" where the original splits "R" and "A") and incomplete communications mapping. These errors are significant and should lead to a notable deduction.

**Score:** 6.0
