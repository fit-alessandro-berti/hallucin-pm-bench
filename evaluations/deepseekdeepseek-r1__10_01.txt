### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Adherence (Strength, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear, even implicitly. "Receive Application", "Record Update", and "Notify Customer" are unchanged as per the prompt (legacy but not overridden). This fully matches the ground truth and policy.

- **Matrix Structure and Format (Partial, +1.5 points)**: Basic RACI table format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns. No extra tasks, roles, or columns added (complies with "unwarranted content" note). However, headers use abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") while ground truth uses full names without abbreviations in headers. LLM adds numbering to activities (e.g., "1. Receive Application") not in ground truth. Blanks are used for no involvement, but ground truth fills every cell, making LLM incomplete. Extra introductory/explanatory text (e.g., "Here's the RACI matrix...", "Key", "All activities strictly use...") is unwarranted, though not severely so.

- **RACI Allocations Correctness (Weak, +1.0 points)**: Major deviations from ground truth across all rows, violating "RACI allocations reflect the narrative" and "each activity has exactly one Responsible; Account Manager is Accountable where appropriate." 
  - Each row has at least 2-4 missing or incorrect assignments (e.g., blanks where ground truth has C or I; combining R/A in single cells where ground truth separates them, e.g., KYC Review: LLM has CO "R/A" and AM "I" vs. ground truth AM "A" and CO "R"; Payment Clearance misses AM "A" and CO "C", has FC "R/A" vs. "R").
  - LLM sparsely adds I's but omits most C's and I's (e.g., Receive Application misses CO "C", FC "I", IT "I"; Notify Customer misses all I's for CO/FC/IT).
  - Falsely claims "C = Consulted not used in this workflow," but ground truth uses C multiple times (e.g., CO "C" in several steps), indicating misinterpretation of full RACI requirements based on narrative implications.
  - Accountable roles for AM are partially correct (e.g., R/A in steps 1, 3, 6) but missed or wrong elsewhere (e.g., step 2: "I" vs. "A"; step 4: absent vs. "A").
  - Exactly one Responsible per activity is mostly met (where assigned), but combinations like "R/A" obscure this and don't match ground truth's separation/bolding.

- **Overall Strictness Penalty (-4.0 points)**: With utmost strictness, even small errors (e.g., per-cell mismatches, incomplete fillings) compound significantly. The LLM captures ~50% of core R/A assignments but fails on ~70% of detailed C/I roles and several A placements, making it substantially incomplete vs. ground truth's full matrix. No self-awareness issues, but the result is a diluted RACI that doesn't fully "reflect the narrative" with inferred consultations/informations.
