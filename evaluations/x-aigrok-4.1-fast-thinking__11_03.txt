### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Perfect match on the three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment in same order), exact quantification of SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s), throughput/SLA/waiting time numbers verbatim from table, and joint criteria implied correctly. Bullet points used only for recommendations as required.
- **Major differences (severe deductions)**: 
  - Headers/subject/From/To/Date fully diverge (e.g., "COO, Orion Credit" vs. "Chief Operating Officer"; "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office"; added "[Current Date]" and "Loan Application Process" phrasing absent in ground truth).
  - Intro/body wording/structure differs significantly (e.g., LLM's explanatory paragraph per activity with case counts vs. ground truth's compact bolded list; "4 805 completed cases" and "queues" absent in LLM).
  - **Recommendations completely mismatched** (core instruction; ~30% of memo): LLM's generic staffing suggestions (e.g., "Allocate additional reviewers") vs. ground truth's specific inventions (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks", "€25 k heuristic"). No semantic overlap despite data grounding.
  - No closing projection in LLM (present in ground truth). Formatting variances (e.g., **bold** vs. **bold** with italics/• bullets).
  - Minor extras like case counts and metric definitions in LLM not in ground truth.
- **Overall**: ~50% content overlap on facts; strict policy demands heavy penalty for recs divergence and structural/wording mismatches (wording differs in nearly every sentence). Score reflects ~half fidelity under utmost strictness.
