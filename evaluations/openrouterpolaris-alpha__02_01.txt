The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1 through Q4, demonstrating perfect adherence to the prompt for those questions. However, Q5 contains a significant error: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list, as this activity does appear as the first event in case C-77. This results in an array with four items instead of three, and an extraneous (incorrect) element, violating the factual basis required by the system instructions to use only directly readable facts from the log. Under utmost strictness, this factual inaccuracy in one question—despite the others being correct—warrants a substantial deduction, as even a single small error (misidentifying a starting activity) reflects incomplete analysis of the log fragment. The score reflects high accuracy overall (80% of questions perfect, with the flawed Q5 partially overlapping but substantively wrong).
