The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, faithfully identifying and describing the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) using exact terminology from the prompt, with precise conditions matching the process flow. The required documents list is complete and verbatim from the prompt (e.g., retaining "CIS template", "single pay-stub or tax slip", "≤ 3 months old"), superior in fidelity to even the ground truth's slight shortenings.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for utmost strictness:
- Omits contextual positioning ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") present in GT (-0.5).
- Structure uses bullets/### headers vs. GT's numbered/####; omits (MBA) abbreviation and GT's extra disclaimer note (-0.3).
- Phrasing tweaks (e.g., "Evaluates..." intros, *approve/reject* italics vs. **Approve**/**Reject** bold/caps, added "for amounts ≥ €15 000" redundancy) (-0.2).

No major errors, inventions, or omissions of content; differences are superficial and do not alter meaning.
