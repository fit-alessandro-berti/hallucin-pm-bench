**6.0**

### Evaluation Summary (strict assessment):
- **Core approach (60% weight)**: Correctly identifies adding a boundary timer event on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H` duration and routing to the existing unused `Activity_AMReview` via new sequence flow. Uses no new activities. Matches intent (+6 points base).
- **Functional correctness (-2.0)**: `cancelActivity="false"` (non-interrupting) vs. ground truth `"true"` (interrupting) is a **major error**. Non-interrupting allows the task to continue past the deadline in parallel with escalation, failing to enforce SLA interruption/cancellation. This is a significant semantic/functional mismatch.
- **XML schema compliance (-1.0)**: Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<bpmn:timeDuration>`, inconsistent with original model's condition expressions and ground truth. Potential schema validation issue.
- **Minor details (-0.5 each, total -1.0)**: Different IDs/names (`Boundary_CreateAccount_SLA`/`Flow_09` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`/`Flow_LateEscalation`; "48h deadline" vs. "48h breach"). No explanatory comments (e.g., ❶/❷). Justification omits "interrupting" and "**bold**" emphasis, less precise.
- **Format/style (-0.5)**: Unnecessary ```xml``` code block; ground truth uses inline comments and "*Justification (1 sentence):*" prefix.
- **Uptime SLA precision (neutral)**: Both attach timer to `CreateAccount` start (not strictly from `Verify Identity` finish), but acceptable as no better option without new elements.

Overall: Strong conceptual match but critical functional/XML errors prevent higher score under "utmost strictness" (small errors = significant loss). Equivalent to ~60% fidelity to ground truth.
