The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable for R1–R6) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are accurate, factually correct, within ≤20 words each, and capture the violations (e.g., R2 links change-triggered approval correctly; R3 exact; R5 correctly identifies pre-approval steps including Receive_Goods, which GT partially omits). Minor deductions (-0.5) for slight phrasing/style differences vs. ground truth (e.g., R1/R4/R6 more verbose/specific with dates; no table format, though prompt specifies text list not table) under utmost strictness.
