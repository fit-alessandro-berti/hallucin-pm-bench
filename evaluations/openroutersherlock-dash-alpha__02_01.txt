4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1**: Exact match (3 distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). Full credit.
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items" immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in A-9321). Full credit.
- **Q3**: Exact match (earliest timestamp is indeed 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00 for A-9321's Receive_Order). Full credit.
- **Q4**: Incorrect (LLM: 3; ground truth: 2). "Quality_Check" occurs only twice (B-1045 at 08:45 and C-77 at 10:00; no third instance). This is a clear counting error from the log, warranting zero credit under strict rules.
- **Q5**: Partial but substantially incorrect. Ground truth lists activities never first in any case: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] (first events are Receive_Order for A/B and Quality_Check for C). LLM includes extraneous "Quality_Check" (which *is* first for C-77) and omits "Pack_Items" (which never starts a case). Only 2/3 elements overlap correctly; the list fails to match, so minimal credit (e.g., 1/3 partial).

Overall: 3/5 questions fully correct, but Q4 and Q5 errors are factual/log-reading failures (not minor; they misrepresent the log). Strict deduction: 60% accuracy → 4.0 (significant loss for errors, no leniency for partial Q5 overlap).
