The LLM Answer fully matches the ground truth in substance and reasoning:

- It clearly states that the requested value cannot be derived (reflecting the required caution).
- It precisely cites the absence of elapsed-time/timestamps, which is the crucial missing data, and emphasizes that only case ID, activity, and resource are available.

No errors or omissions; the answer meets the strict criteria perfectly.
