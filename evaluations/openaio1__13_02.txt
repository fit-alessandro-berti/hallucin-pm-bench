The LLM answer is nearly perfect. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the ground truth exactly in facts and calculations. For question 3, the response is concise (60 words), addresses the single occurrence (i), implies instability/variance through distortion of metrics like cycle time and scant data leading to unreliability (ii, though not as explicit as "noise" or "confidence intervals"), and cautions against over-generalization (iii). Minor deduction for slightly less precise phrasing on variance, but overall highly aligned.
