**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision points (major failure, ~40% weight)**: Ground truth identifies **exactly 3 precise decision branches** (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with exact phrasing, positions in flow (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"), and terminology (e.g., "≤ 2", "< €15 000", "≥ €15 000", "**Approve** or **Reject**"). LLM incorrectly lists **6 items**, treating non-decisions (KYC, CIA, Dual Underwriter Split, NFC) as "decision points"; merges Board into Amount Threshold (missing it as separate #3); alters phrasing (e.g., "more than 2 points" vs. "≤ 2"; "less than €15,000" vs. "< €15 000"; no position context). This is a fundamental mismatch. (-5.8 points)
- **Required documents (~40% weight)**: Lists all 6 correctly, matching prompt terminology closely (e.g., "CIS template"). Minor phrasing diffs vs. ground truth: "not older than 3 months" (synonymous but not "≤ 3 months"); adds "single" and "Latest" (per prompt, but GT abbreviates); omits GT's parenthetical note and "*No credit bureau...*". Acceptable but not identical. (+3.6 points)
- **Structure/Formatting (~10% weight)**: LLM uses simple numbered lists; lacks GT's #### headers, bolding, precise bullet conditions, italics, and flow context. (+0.4 points)
- **Fidelity to prompt (~10% weight)**: Uses exact activity names; no standard terminology introduced. But fails "summarise the **decision points**" by expanding to non-decisions. (+0.5 points)

**Total: 4.2/10** (strict deduction for core content mismatch; documents salvage partial score).
