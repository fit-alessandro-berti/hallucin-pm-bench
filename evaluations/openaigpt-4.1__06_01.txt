The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and format (one pair per line with the specified structure). No differences or errors are present, including no extraneous pairs or omissions. Minor potential rendering variations in spacing (e.g., alignment of em-dashes) do not constitute errors under the prompt's requirements, as the functional output is identical.
