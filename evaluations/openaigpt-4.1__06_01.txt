8.5

The LLM answer included both correct pairs, and both are in the correct alphabetical order within and across pairs, and follow the requested output format. However, there is a subtle formatting difference: the ground truth separates the words in the second pair with extra spaces ("Procure_Materials     â€”  Schedule_Machines") while the LLM answer only uses one space. Also, while minor, the absence of the code block formatting in the LLM answer compared to the ground truth may be considered a small miss in presentation, depending on strict adherence to format, though the prompt did not require a code block.

Given the instruction to penalize even small errors, the answer is marked down. The content is entirely correct, but small formatting discrepancies (spacing, lack of code block) justify a deduction.
