### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary (mandated terms)**: Perfect match (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance used exactly with bolding; no forbidden terms). +2.0 points.
- **Structure**: Table format similar (rows/columns/roles match); no extra tasks/roles/columns. Minor deductions for extraneous title (# header), legend, and note (-0.5); inconsistent formatting (e.g., **A/R** vs **R / A** with no spaces/swap; markdown table quirks). 
- **RACI Content (core failure)**: Massive discrepancies vs. ground truth across **all 6 rows** (24 cells total; ~70% incorrect):
  | Activity | # Wrong Cells | Key Errors |
  |----------|---------------|------------|
  | Receive Application | 1 | CO: I vs C; AM: A/R vs R / A |
  | KYC Review | 3 | AM: I vs A; CO: R/A vs R; FC: I vs C |
  | Order Vetting | 1 | CO: I vs C; AM: A/R vs R / A |
  | Payment Clearance | 3 | AM: I vs A; CO: I vs C; FC: R/A vs R |
  | Record Update | 3 | AM: I vs C; FC: I vs C; IT: R/A vs R |
  | Notify Customer | 0 (minor) | AM: A/R vs R / A (swap/no space) |
  - No row fully matches. Violates "exactly one Responsible" nuance (LLM adds unwarranted A to R in multiple rows); misses C/I allocations; ignores narrative-ground-truth mappings (e.g., CO/FC C in several).
- **Overall**: Vocab/structure salvage minor points, but RACI errors (primary task) are pervasive/major → near-minimum score. Unwarranted legend/note adds bloat.
