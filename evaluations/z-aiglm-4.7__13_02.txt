9.8

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content and accuracy. Q1 matches exactly in value ("1"), with trivial wording variance ("time" is implicit). Q2a/b numerics and rounding are precise (2.08%, 8.33%), though minor formatting diffs (no space before %, no calc shown—but not required). Q3 meets all criteria (i: single occurrence; ii: variance/unreliable/skewed; iii: over-generalisation caution), under 100 words, process-mining relevant (cycle time, predictions), without invention. Deduct 0.2 for small phrasing/formatting diffs under strictness.
