**9.4**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and directly addresses the prompt with a correct "Yes," an identical core firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3), precise marking evolutions, and a clear, brief justification focused on T5's enablement conditions (p3 ≥ 1, p4 = 0 via inhibitor arc, pre-T3). It explicitly verifies inhibitor arc logic and notes T3's enablement without firing, fully proving possibility.

**Minor deductions (-0.6 total, per strictness):**
- Stylistic/presentation differences: More verbose/enumerated vs. ground truth's compact list (-0.2).
- Lacks ground truth's extra insight ("must fire before T3 if ever"; permanent disablement post-T3) (-0.2); prompt only requires proving *possibility*, not necessity.
- Minor phrasing: "step 3" for T5 vs. implicit sequencing; "optional" T3 explicit but unnecessary (-0.1).
- No inclusion of extraneous/invalid T4 (ground truth error: T4 impossible post-T5/T3 as p3=0), making LLM *more* precise (-0.1 avoided penalty).

No factual errors; superior to ground truth in avoiding invalid step. Extremely close match on required elements.
