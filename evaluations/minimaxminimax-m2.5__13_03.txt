7.5

**Rationale**:  
Part 1: Exact match (10/10).  
Part 2: Concise and ≤120 words (45 words). Correctly notes tiny sample (3 cases), single-day span, potential over/under-representation (8/10). Deductions for: speculation on bias ("chosen cases may have required manual review"—violates "no speculation"); misses critical ground-truth points like event count (14), precise time span (<2 hours), quantified sampling volatility (0%-7% swing), wide CI, rare-event error, and near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check"/"Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing strict/fuzzy matching distortion (-2.5 total).
