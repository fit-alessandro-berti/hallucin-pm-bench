**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a)** (~6/10): Identifies the exact two decision points correctly. Logic is equivalent (inverted phrasing for the first is logically identical but less direct than ground truth's "bypasses if condition; otherwise proceeds"). Minor deductions for: naming as "Step 4" vs. ground truth's descriptive "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; "grant approval" vs. "record 'Approve'"; "application passes" vs. "loan may advance only when". These are small phrasing/style differences but warrant ~40% loss under strictness rule.
- **Part (b)** (~0/10): Catastrophic failures—misses **all three Scorecard inputs** (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow; explicit documents first appearing in Step 3, comprising 33% of ground truth list). Fails to list **Signed Offer Sheet 77** as separate/distinct (first appears Step 8, per process wording). Lists only 5 items vs. ground truth's 9, with incorrect order due to omissions. Note on signed Offer Sheet partially acknowledges but does not include it in the list as required. No hallucinations, but massive omissions = near-total mismatch.
- **Overall**: Weighted average heavily penalizes (b)'s completeness failure (half the prompt). Strictness amplifies small errors (phrasing) and crushes large ones (omissions); no perfect match disqualifies 10.0.
