### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, ~2/10 impact)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms. However, the added activities use unauthorized phrasings ("Compliance Officer approval", "Treasury Ops schedule payment", "Release funds & notify analyst"), violating the "do not rename, merge, or add activities" rule.
- **Structure and Activities (Major Violation, ~0/10 impact)**: The prompt requires covering *every activity* without adding, merging, or renaming. The LLM adds 3 extra rows (7 total vs. ground truth's 6), splits "Release Funds" into "Treasury Ops schedule payment" and "Release funds & notify analyst" (adding/merging violation), and slightly renames "Compliance Officer Approval". This fundamentally deviates from the ground truth's exact activity set and naming.
- **RACI Assignments (Severe Mismatches, ~1/10 impact)**: Strict cell-by-cell comparison shows widespread errors, even for matching activities:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office correct (R/A), but Compliance Analyst is I (should be C), Officer I (should be –), Treasury correct (I).
  - **KYC Review**: Front I (should be –), Analyst correct (R/A), Officer I (should be C), Treasury correct.
  - **AML Screening**: Same errors as KYC (Front I vs. –, Officer I vs. C).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front I (should be C), Analyst R/A (should be R only, no A), Officer C (should be A), Treasury correct.
  - Added rows do not align with ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" (e.g., Treasury I vs. –) or "Release Funds" (e.g., Analyst/ Officer I vs. C; splits the activity incorrectly).
  - Dashes (–) for no involvement are entirely missing; LLM uses I inappropriately.
  - Overall, ~70% of cells mismatch, with consistent over-assignment of I and incorrect R/A vs. separate R/A.
- **Formatting (Minor but Strict Deduction, ~1/10 impact)**: Markdown table is present, but lacks bolding (**R, A**) for emphasis; uses slash notation (R/A) instead of comma-separated (R, A); no dashes (–); column headers have non-breaking hyphen (Front‑Office) vs. standard.
- **Overall Strictness**: Multiple rule violations (adding/splitting activities is a core breach), plus pervasive RACI inaccuracies, warrant a low score. Partial credit only for correct vocabulary on the four core activities and basic table structure. Any single added row or RACI mismatch would deduct significantly; cumulative errors compound to near-failure.
