6.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer largely respects the vocabulary policy: only “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, and “Risk Scoring” are used for the activities.
- No synonyms or disallowed phrasings leak into the LLM response table.
- The response follows the format and covers all major activities/roles in a Markdown table.

**Weaknesses (errors and their significance):**

1. **Activity Name Deviations and Additions:**
   - Adds **Treasury Ops schedule payment** and **Release funds & notify analyst** as distinct activities, whereas the ground truth clusters both under **Release Funds**. The prompt is explicit: “do not rename, merge, or add activities.” This is a direct violation.
   - Uses **Compliance Officer approval** instead of **Compliance Officer Approval** (minor casing difference).
   
2. **Participation Marking Mismatches:**
   - **Risk Scoring:** LLM has Compliance Officer as Consulted (C), but the ground truth assigns Accountable (A).
   - **Release funds & notify analyst:** In the LLM, only Treasury Ops is R/A, with others being I. The ground truth marks Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer as Consulted (C).
   - **Treasury Ops schedule payment**: Activity not present in ground truth at all.
   - **Compliance Officer Approval:** LLM makes the Compliance Analyst "Consulted" (C), but ground truth does the same; however, for **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**, the ground truth marks Treasury Ops as Informed (I) and Compliance Officer as Consulted (C), which the LLM replicates for some but not all roles consistently.

3. **Formatting:**
   - “R/A” is used correctly (though with a slash and not comma), but the ground truth uses “R, A.” While minor, the ground truth demonstrates that “R, A” should be preferred.
   - Dashes (“–”) for no involvement are missing in the LLM answer, which weakens strict compliance with format.

4. **Missing/Overassigned Involvement:**
   - Inconsistencies in marking “Consulted,” “Informed,” and non-involvement (especially for Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening) compared to ground truth.
   - For activities such as **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**, the LLM lists all other stakeholders as “I” (Informed), but ground truth distinguishes between “C” and “I”.

**Conclusion:**
- Grading strictly, this answer shows good effort and adherence to the vocabulary policy, but has notable errors in activity naming, inclusion of unauthorized activities, missed formatting requirements, and misassigned RACI roles.
- Each instance of divergence results in a significant loss of points as requested.

**Final score: 6.0**
