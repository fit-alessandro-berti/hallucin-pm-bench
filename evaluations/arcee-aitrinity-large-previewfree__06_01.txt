**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correct identification of pairs (+3.0 base)**: LLM correctly identifies the *only* two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials—Schedule_Machines; Quality_Check—Create_Documentation). No extras or misses.
- **Alphabetical order *within* each pair (-2.0)**: First pair correct (P before S). Second pair **reversed** (Quality_Check before Create_Documentation; Q > C alphabetically). Direct violation of "alphabetical order... *within* each pair".
- **Alphabetical order of overall list (-2.0)**: List starts with "Procure_Materials" (P), then "Quality_Check" (Q). Correct order by first task: "Create_Documentation" (C) before "Procure_Materials" (P). Wrong due to intra-pair error.
- **Output format (-1.5)**: Extra introductory sentence ("Here are...") violates "Output one pair per line, using the format `Task_X — Task_Y`". No code block. Minor spacing/alignment diffs (e.g., no column alignment as in ground truth).
- **Other (rationale absence, etc., -0.5)**: No rationale provided (ground truth includes it for completeness/clarity). Negligible extras like double spaces.
- **Strictness adjustment**: Small formatting issues compound with major ordering violations (explicitly instructed), warranting >50% deduction from perfect score. Content strong, execution flawed.
