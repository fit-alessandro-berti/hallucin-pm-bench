The LLM answer identifies only one decision point (the amount threshold), omitting two critical ones from the ground truth: the eligibility check in triage (with reject/continue branching) and the final approval/rejection at pre-approval/auditor review. This represents a major incompleteness in summarizing "every decision point," as the ground truth explicitly includes these inferred but logically necessary branches based on the process constraints (e.g., validation and approval steps imply pass/fail outcomes). The documents list matches the ground truth exactly in content and conditional note for AuditTrail, which is accurate. However, the LLM's structure (single decision summary vs. ground truth's detailed table with three points) and addition of extraneous "Important Notes" (reiterating instructions unnecessarily) introduce minor deviations. Under strict evaluation, the partial coverage of decision points warrants a significant deduction, despite the strong document section.
