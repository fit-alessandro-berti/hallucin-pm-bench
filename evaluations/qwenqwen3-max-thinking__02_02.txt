**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth across all questions:

- **Q1/A1**: Exactly "3".
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" (ground truth escaping is display artifact; content matches).
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), alphabetically ordered, one per line (ground truth uses markdown bullets/`<br>`; LLM uses plain lines per prompt instruction—semantically equivalent, no content difference).

No errors, omissions, fabrications, or hallucinations. Explanations are accurate and supportive (not penalized as "extra" under strict factual precision). Perfect match.
