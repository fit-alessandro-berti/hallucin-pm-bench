**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Structural differences (major deduction: -4.0)**: LLM uses non-standard RACI format (R/A/C/I as columns with role names in cells); ground truth uses standard roles-as-columns with letter codes (**R**, **A**, etc.) + Legend. Extra title/header in LLM. Different column labels ("Task Description" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)").
- **Role differences (major deduction: -2.0)**: LLM misuses "**KYC Review**" (mandated *activity* term) as a role throughout table; includes IT Support but omits "Operations Manager" (present in ground truth). Violates "only mandated terms" indirectly by role invention/misuse.
- **Task coverage/wording differences (major deduction: -1.5)**: 7 tasks vs. ground truth's 6 (extra "Notify..." row, despite informal text implying it; combines SWIFT into release but ground truth separates implicitly). Wording variances: e.g., "Receive transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform **KYC Review** check on sender and beneficiary" (extraneous details) vs. "**KYC Review**"; "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record"; direct violation "**compliance officer**" (must be "Regulatory Liaison"). No post-table notes matching ground truth.
- **RACI assignments (major deduction: -0.5)**: Almost no cell matches. Partial overlaps (e.g., some TA **R**, RL **A**) but systematically divergent (e.g., ground truth emphasizes Operations Manager **A** everywhere; LLM shifts to RL/KYC).
- **Minor compliance (slight credit: +0.0)**: Markdown table used; some mandated terms applied (e.g., "**KYC Review**" in task, Transaction Analyst/Regulatory Liaison for clerk/compliance); covers informal steps broadly.

Total: Highly divergent in format, content, assignments, and strict vocabulary adherence—warrants minimal score under utmost strictness.
