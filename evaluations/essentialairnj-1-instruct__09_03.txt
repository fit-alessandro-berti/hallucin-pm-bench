**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates catastrophically from the ground truth by fabricating arbitrary fictional cycle times (e.g., 203, 215 hours) and computing fake metrics (average 230.4 hours, SD 8.675, CI [211.883, 249.017]), directly violating the explicit instruction against guessing or using outside knowledge. It buries a partial admission of impossibility after misleading arithmetic, fails to provide a single short explanatory paragraph as required, and ignores the core task of recognizing absent data (redacted timestamps in Artefact A). No alignment with ground truth's precise, concise refusal.
