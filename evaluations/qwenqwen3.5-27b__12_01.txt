The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate with a precise verdict and provides evidence-based counterexamples from Cases 1001 and 1003, accurately noting the reversed order using timestamps and activities as requested. It matches the core logic and brevity of the ground truth. However, it omits Case 1002 entirely (where `Update_Inventory` is absent, directly disproving "always"), failing to cover all data comprehensively like the ground truth, which deducts points under strict evaluation for incomplete case analysis despite sufficiency for disproof. Structure and phrasing are similar but not identical (no bullets or line citations).
