The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and correctly identifies the core issue (lack of timestamps) in one sentence as required, directly matching the ground truth's conclusion and reasoning intent. Minor deductions for slight wording differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; no explicit mention of "event counts" or "start-to-completion intervals"; omission of activity name in the sentence; no reference to duration info), but these are trivial semantic overlaps with no factual errors.
