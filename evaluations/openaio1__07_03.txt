8.5

The LLM answer contains all the correct differences present in the ground truth answer, and groups them under the required headings in the required order. However, there are two small formatting errors:

- The LLM answer uses bullet points (•) instead of dashes (-) as prescribed in the ground truth answer.
- There is a minor difference regarding the whitespace alignment of "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel" (the ground truth uses extra spaces for alignment).

Since the prompt emphasizes grading with utmost strictness and penalizing even small errors significantly, these formatting issues result in a noticeable deduction, but the factual accuracy and structure are otherwise fully correct.
