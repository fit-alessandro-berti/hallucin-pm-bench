The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, accurately identifying all added tasks, the removed task, and the two gateway changes with correct IDs, names, and type transitions. However, it loses points for minor formatting discrepancies: using "â€¢" bullets instead of "-" dashes (as in the ground truth), and lacking the deliberate spacing alignment in the second gateway entry (e.g., no extra spaces after the colon in "Gateway_Payment:" to match the layout). Under strict evaluation, these small presentation differences warrant a deduction despite perfect functional accuracy.
