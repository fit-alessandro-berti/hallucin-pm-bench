The LLM answer exactly enumerates the three parallel task sets in Process B as required, with tasks accurately listed and separated by commas, one parallel block per line. There are no references to other processes, and all sequential-only tasks are excluded. The output formatting mirrors the ground truth precisely, both in content and structure. There are no discernible errors.
