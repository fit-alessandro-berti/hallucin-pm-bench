8.5

The LLM answer matches all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) exactly and the overall **NON-COMPLIANT** result. Format adheres strictly to the prompt (per-rule bold status + ≤20-word justification, all-caps conclusion). Justifications are accurate, concise, and correct in identifying violations.

Deductions for strict textual/content differences vs. ground truth (significant per instructions):
- R2: Justification conflates R5 logic ("before new Manager_Approval"); omits "expedited", dates (05-Mar/07-Mar), "2 days" timing (-2.0 for core mismatch).
- R3: Omits dates (06-Mar/07-Mar) (-0.25).
- R5: Vague "further steps" vs. specific "Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice" (-0.25).

Semantically strong (violations correctly reasoned), but strict wording/date specificity gaps reduce from 10.0.
