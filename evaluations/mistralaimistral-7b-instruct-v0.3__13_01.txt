**6.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Scoring):
- **Q1 (25% weight)**: Perfect match ("1 time" ≡ "1 occurrence"). **10/10**
- **Q2 (25% weight)**: Major error. Computes fraction (0.0556) instead of percentage (must be 5.56%). No ×100; wrong units/value/format despite "percentage" prompt and "round to two decimal places." Ground truth explicitly shows `5.56 %` with calc. **0/10**
- **Q3 (25% weight)**: Exact match (A1002 only). **10/10**
- **Q4 (25% weight)**: Acceptable; lists two valid sampling reasons ("small sample size," "not representative/case-mix bias"). Aligns with ground truth examples but more generic/wordy (e.g., infers variation "among case identifiers" without high-risk specifics; no variance quantification like ±5.56 pp). Minor deductions for precision. **8/10**

**Weighted Total: (10 + 0 + 10 + 8)/4 = 7.0 → Adjusted to 6.0** for Q2's critical math/policy violation (must derive *directly* from log; error reveals miscalc), excess verbosity, and strict "small errors = significant loss" rule. No hallucinations, but precision gaps.
