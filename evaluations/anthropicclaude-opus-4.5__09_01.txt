The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in core content: both clearly state the value cannot be derived/computed, correctly attribute this to missing timestamps/durations/elapsed times, note the limited columns in the log, and avoid fabricating data or using the irrelevant historical benchmark. Strengths include precise matching of question structure (1) and (2)), explicit quoting of the header, and confirmatory details (e.g., 4 cases, resources listed—all factually correct from the log).

Minor deductions (-0.2) for stylistic/verbosity differences from the concise ground truth: added "## Analysis Response" header, bulleted lists, bolded subpoints, and extra confirmatory details (case count/resources) that, while accurate and helpful, introduce non-essential elaboration not present in ground truth, slightly deviating under utmost strictness for "differences." No factual errors, fabrications, or violations of system rules.
