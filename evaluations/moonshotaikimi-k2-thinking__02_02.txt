9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: The LLM correctly identifies 3 distinct cases, matching the ground truth factually. However, it adds unnecessary details ("distinct cases (C001, C002, C003)") beyond the simple "**3**" expected, introducing extraneous wording that deviates from the concise ground truth format. This minor elaboration counts as a small error under strict criteria, warranting a deduction.
- **Q2**: Exact match in content and sequence (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order). The ground truth's escaped underscores (e.g., Receive\_Order) appear to be markdown artifacts; the LLM's unescaped version is semantically identical and follows the prompt's plain-text style. No deduction.
- **Q3**: Content is precise—distinct activities are Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock, listed alphabetically, one per line. However, the ground truth uses bullet points with dashes ("-") and HTML line breaks ("<br>"), while the LLM uses plain lines without them. This formatting mismatch, though minor, deviates from the ground truth presentation and violates strict line-by-line precision, resulting in a deduction. No hallucinations or factual errors.

Overall score reflects high accuracy (no major errors or fabrications) but penalizes small deviations in conciseness and formatting per the strictness directive.
