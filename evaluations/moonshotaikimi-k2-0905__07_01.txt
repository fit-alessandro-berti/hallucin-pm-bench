8.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and presents the correct differences under the required headings. The use of element names (ids) matches the XML, and nothing else is speculated or added.

However, it has significant shortcomings by omitting the **task names** in the added and removed tasks (e.g., for `check_vip`, it should say "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)" instead of only "check_vip"). The ground truth requires both the id and the task name as per the BPMN XML, but the LLM only lists the ids, which is a substantial detail loss.

Additionally, while the gateway change is described accurately both in name and type, the LLM could improve by using the exact phrasing as the ground truth (i.e., including backticks and bold to mark the types, as in "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)").

Due to these omissions and slight format differences that result in loss of important information (the task names), I deduct 2.0 points for strictness.
