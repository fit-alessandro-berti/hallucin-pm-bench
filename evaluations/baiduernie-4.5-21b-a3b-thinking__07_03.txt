9.0

The LLM answer is semantically and factually identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the two gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with no extras, omissions, or commentary. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for formatting differences: absence of bullet points ("- ") before each item (missing in all sections: 3 in ADDED TASKS, 1 in REMOVED TASKS, 2 in GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES) and lack of alignment spaces in the second gateway entry (e.g., no padding after "Gateway_Payment:" to match the ground truth's visual structure). These are small but verifiable deviations from the ground truth's exact presentation, warranting a deduction of 1.0 point total.
