The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate by answering "No" and provides a precise justification with accurate sequences for the counterexample cases (C002 and C004) as well as brief acknowledgment of the compliant cases (C001 and C003). This directly matches the ground truth's core content, including the case-specific sequences, notes on interventions, and the reasoning that "always" is disproved by exceptions. The presentation differs (bullets vs. table) but does not introduce errors, omissions, or inaccuracies, fully adhering to the task requirements.
