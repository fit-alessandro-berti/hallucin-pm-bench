8.0

The LLM answer provides a correct overall judgment ("No") and identifies the precise cases (C002, C004) where the claimed behavior is violated. It gives the relevant activity sequences for those cases and a clear explanation of why the fact is untrue. 

However, compared to the ground truth answer, it loses points for the following minor but significant issues:

- The LLM answer omits explicitly mentioning that in C001 and C003, the rule is actually followed. The ground truth's table/notes make it clear which cases comply and which do not, adding an important element of completeness and transparency.
- It does not systematically walk through all cases or provide a complete table/side-by-side summary, which is a clear strength of the ground truth justification.
- The presentation of evidence is less granular than the ground truth (which uses a table and specific notation to reinforce its point).

These omissions are worth a significant deduction per the requested strictness, resulting in an 8.0 score.
