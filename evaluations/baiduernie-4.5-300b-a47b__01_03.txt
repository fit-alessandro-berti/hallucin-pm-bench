7.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM identifies three decision points:  
  1. The outcome of the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (assigns risk rating)  
  2. The conditional skip to Manual-Underwriting-Review (based on risk rating and amount)  
  3. The TriVote approval (two out of three required for approval)  

- Strictly, only two actual "gates/conditional branches" are present:  
  - The risk-amount conditional skip  
  - The TriVote approval  
- The LLM incorrectly lists the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome itself as a decision point, when per the prompt, the *branch* after that step is the real decision point.  
- Scoring: This is a significant, but not egregious, mis-categorization.

**b) Required Documents**

- The LLM correctly lists all input documents except it merges "Offer Sheet 77" and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as just "Offer Sheet 77," omitting the explicit need for a signed version for applicant confirmation.  
- Ordering is otherwise correct.  
- No hallucinated documents.  
- The omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is a notable, but not catastrophic, error.

**General Points Deducted:**
- -1.0: Incorrectly identifies an extra "decision point."
- -1.0: Fails to distinguish "Offer Sheet 77" from "Signed Offer Sheet 77."
- -1.0: Lacks precise adherence to the step-by-step nature of the process, and the descriptions, while mostly correct, are not always one concise sentence as requested.

**Final Score:** 7.0 â€” The answer demonstrates good understanding, but notable errors and omissions mean it cannot be rated higher per the explicit strictness requested.
