### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 3.0/10):**  
The LLM incorrectly identifies three decision points, including the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome itself as a "decision point," which is not a gate or conditional branch per the promptâ€”it's an input step producing a rating. The ground truth correctly limits to two: the risk/amount conditional skip (step 4) and the TriVote gate (step 6). The LLM's description of the conditional branch is mostly accurate but adds an extraneous first item, inflating the count and diluting focus. The TriVote summary is close but uses "vote to approve" instead of ground truth's precise "record 'Approve'," introducing minor phrasing deviation. This extra point and misclassification are significant errors under strict criteria, warranting major deduction.

**Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 5.0/10):**  
The list is incomplete and partially out of order. It correctly identifies and sequences the first five documents (Form 14B through Deck Memo) but fails to separate "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document (mentioned uniquely in step 8), treating the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" as covering both appearances. This omits a required entry from the ground truth. Additionally, "ID Matrix Declaration" is placed before the signed offer (item 7 vs. ground truth's 8), disrupting the first-appearance order from step 8. Unnecessary parenthetical notes (e.g., step references) add extraneous detail not in the ground truth. No hallucinations (e.g., KYC/AML) occur, avoiding worse penalties, but the omissions and reordering are clear inaccuracies.

**Overall Score Calculation:** Averaged from parts (weighted equally), with strict penalties for incompleteness (missing document), structural errors (extra decision point, wrong order), and minor phrasing inconsistencies. The response captures ~70% of the essence but deviates critically from the ground truth's precision and structure.
