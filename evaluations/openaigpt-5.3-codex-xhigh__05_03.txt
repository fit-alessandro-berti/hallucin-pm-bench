The LLM answer is functionally identical and correct, precisely addressing the task by adding an interrupting boundary timer on "Activity_CreateAccount" with PT48H duration connected to the existing "Activity_AMReview" without new activities, with a concise one-sentence justification. Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for: (1) omitting `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (inconsistent with original XML's style for similar expressions, risking schema subtlety); (2) cosmetic differences in IDs, boundaryEvent name, absence of explanatory comments, and justification rewording (not bit-for-bit matching ground truth despite semantic equivalence).
