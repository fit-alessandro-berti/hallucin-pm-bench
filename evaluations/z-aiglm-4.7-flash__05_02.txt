The LLM answer proposes a completely different modification (wrong task: `Task_GrantAccess` instead of `Task_CollectEquipment`; invalid change: arbitrary absolute datetime `"2023-12-31T23:59:59"` instead of duration `"P2D"`; semantically irrelevant to SLA as it doesn't shorten cumulative delays and introduces a hardcoded expiration), mismatched rationale (focuses on "indefinite execution" vs. cycle time reduction for 3-day SLA), and non-matching diff format/style (includes extraneous file headers and line numbers absent in ground truth).
