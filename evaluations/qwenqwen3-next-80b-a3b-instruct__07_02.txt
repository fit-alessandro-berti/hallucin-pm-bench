4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Structure (20% weight)**: The LLM uses the exact required headings and bullet-point grouping, which aligns well with the prompt. Minor deduction for not matching the ground truth's numbered list and bold formatting, but this is stylistic. Score: 8/10.
- **Added Tasks (30% weight)**: Correctly identifies the three new tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject) by ID, matching ground truth names/IDs. However, includes an extraneous, incorrect note claiming Task_ApproveLoan is "replaced, not added" due to a semantic rename—this violates the prompt's "ignore cosmetic renamings" and introduces false analysis (the ID remains the same, so it's neither added nor removed). This taints the section with unnecessary and erroneous content. Strict penalty for deviation. Score: 5/10.
- **Removed Tasks (30% weight)**: Correctly identifies Task_RejectLoan as removed, but erroneously adds "Task_ApproveLoan (original version)" as removed, contradicting the prompt (ID unchanged, only name altered—ignore renamings). This is a factual error, creating a false positive and inflating the list beyond ground truth. No mention of the semantic replacement nuance, but the core mistake is listing a non-removed task. Major strict penalty. Score: 3/10.
- **Gateway-Type Changes (20% weight)**: Accurately notes the change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision, aligning with the prompt's example. However, omits ground truth details like "exclusive (XOR)" and "inclusive (OR)" explanations, and doesn't specify versions (v1 to v2). Minor but notable incompleteness under strict criteria. Score: 7/10.

**Weighted Total**: (8*0.2) + (5*0.3) + (3*0.3) + (7*0.2) = 4.5/10. The response is mostly on-topic but undermined by two significant factual inaccuracies (false removal and extraneous note), which per instructions warrant substantial point loss for even "small" errors in content fidelity to ground truth.
