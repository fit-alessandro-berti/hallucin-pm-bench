• The answer correctly identifies all three "added tasks" (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), though it adds an unnecessary comment about Task_ApproveLoan, calling it "replaced"—this is superfluous since the task (by id) still exists and thus isn't added or removed, only renamed (which the instructions say to ignore). 

• It incorrectly claims that Task_ApproveLoan (original version) is a "removed task". This is factually wrong: Task_ApproveLoan's ID is present in both versions, only its name changes (and per instructions, we ignore such renamings). This is a significant error.

• The answer correctly lists Task_RejectLoan as removed, matching the ground truth.

• The gateway-type change is correctly captured.

• The answer's structure under the three headings is in line with the requirements.

Penalties:

-1 for the spurious removal of Task_ApproveLoan  
-0.5 for the distracting remark regarding "replacement" semantics (per instructions, renamings are to be ignored)  
-1.5 for not strictly reporting only true changes per the headings (section "Removed tasks" is incorrect, which is significant)
