5.0

**Justification:**
- **Vocabulary Usage (Mandate):** The LLM answer correctly uses "Transaction Analyst," "Regulatory Liaison," and "KYC Review" as mandated. However, it incorrectly introduces a step: "Notify Regulatory Liaison after case closure" (Task 8), which is not explicitly in the description and not treated as a standalone activity in the ground truth. This risks vocabulary or process creep.
- **Task Breakdown (Deviations):**
    - The LLM version splits/conflates activities (e.g., approving high-risk transactions and KYC Review are not clearly separated in roles or accountability).
    - The answers omit the **Operations Manager** (Accountable in every step in the ground truth). The absence of this critical role is a significant error.
    - Tasks such as "Archive Record" are not explicitly and correctly named (should match the ground truth nomenclature precisely).
    - The LLM table includes "Consulted" for roles where the ground truth shows "Informed" or nothing, which alters the understanding of the involved parties' responsibilities.
    - "Accountable" (A) role is missing or inaccurately assigned throughout—Regulatory Liaison appears as both Responsible and Accountable improperly, and Operations Manager is not present at all.
    - "Consulted" and "Informed" are misapplied or overused (e.g., IT Support is "Consulted" for "Release Payment" when they are only to ensure message delivery in the source text, and in the ground truth not involved as Consulted).
- **Formatting:** Markdown usage is correct, but the header could be clearer to match the precision of the ground truth.
- **Strictness Requirements:** Multiple small errors—role omissions, inaccurate or excess task steps, incorrect assignments—accumulate to a significant deviation from the expected answer.

**Summary:** 
The LLM answer partially fulfills the vocabulary mandate and general task structure but makes notable and compounding errors in role assignment, task mapping, and strict adherence to the exact ground truth activities and responsibilities. These warrant a significant deduction, resulting in a strict score of **5.0**.
