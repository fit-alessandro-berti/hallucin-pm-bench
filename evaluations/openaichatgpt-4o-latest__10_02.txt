### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt by correctly using the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and producing a Markdown RACI table that covers the core process steps. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs significant point deductions for multiple deviations from the ground truth:

- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: The table has only 3 columns (missing "Operations Manager"), while the ground truth has 4. This omits a key role implied for accountability/oversight, violating full coverage of roles. Additionally, the LLM expands to 8 tasks (splitting release/SWIFT, adding a separate "notify" task), introducing unsubstantiated extras not in the source or ground truth, which has exactly 6 concise tasks. This creates omissions in mapping (e.g., no explicit SWIFT handling in ground truth) and substitutions (e.g., "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record").

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: Assignments differ in nearly every row, often substantially. Examples:
  - Task 1 (Receive): Ground truth has IT as "C" and Ops as "A"; LLM has IT as "I" with no "A" assigned (incomplete RACI).
  - Task 2 (Screen): Ground truth has RL as "A" and Ops/IT differentiated; LLM simplifies RL/IT to "I" (wrong emphasis on accountability).
  - Tasks 3/4 (KYC/Approve): Ground truth has TA as "C" and Ops as "A"; LLM has TA as "I" (consulted vs. informed distinction lost) and no Ops "A".
  - Task 5 (Release): Matches closely but lacks Ops "A".
  - Extras (Tasks 6-8): Entirely invented or mis-split, with flawed logic (e.g., IT "R" for notifying RL, who is then "A" â€“ contradicts source implication that IT handles archiving/notification without RL accountability).

- **Formatting and Presentation (Minor but Significant Deduction: -1.0 points)**: Uses full words ("Responsible") instead of ground truth's abbreviations ("**R**" with bolding). Task wordings are verbose (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary" vs. concise "**KYC Review**"). Adds extraneous "Notes" section explaining RACI (not in ground truth) and a footer claim about mandated terms, bloating the output beyond the prompt's "Put the table in Markdown" directive.

Overall, while the LLM demonstrates basic understanding and no violations of vocabulary mandates, the cumulative differences in completeness, accuracy, and fidelity to the ground truth (especially role coverage and task mapping) result in a low score. A perfect match would require identical structure, tasks, and assignments.
