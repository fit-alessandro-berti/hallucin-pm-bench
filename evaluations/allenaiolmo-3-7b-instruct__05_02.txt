The LLM answer fails catastrophically: invalid unified diff format (full file reprint with filename prefix instead of single @@ hunk), adds invalid XML comment, illegally changes `serviceTask` to `userTask` (altering element type, violating no add/delete activities), applies irrelevant/worsening change (P1D→P2D on non-bottleneck task instead of P5D→P2D), reorders XML irrelevantly without flow reversal, and provides incorrect rationale ignoring the 3-day SLA/end-to-end cycle tied to Collect Equipment's P5D.
