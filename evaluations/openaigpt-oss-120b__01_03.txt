6.0

**a) Decision points (gates/branches):**
- The LLM answer gives generally correct logic for both main decision points, but the first description is not fully explicit in expressing the exact risk+amount condition ("only if the rating is High or amount exceeds €250k"), which is slightly less precise than the ground truth's format ("if risk is Low or Medium and amount ≤ €250k, skip...; otherwise go to review"). Also, the LLM incorrectly titles the TriVote as “the third approval is optional,” which could mislead—approval is based on *any two*, but all three must participate (as per process notes). These are moderately significant deviations from the expected strict summary.

**b) Document list:**
- The LLM omits the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which per the ground truth are required as documents (they are indeed explicitly named as inputs to the Tri-Color-Risk-Check). Also, “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is missing—it only notes "Offer Sheet 77" and doesn’t distinguish the original (Step 7) from the *signed* version returned by the applicant (Step 8). The order of documents is thus incomplete and incorrect compared to the ground truth.
- The Deck Memo is correctly marked as conditional. The other listed documents are otherwise mentioned in the right process order.

**Additional comments:**
- Positive: The LLM did not hallucinate any extra documents or steps. It also clarified reasoning for omission of scorecards, but that reasoning is contrary to instructions (the scorecards are named as required documents in the process, and “document” is not restricted to deliverables *from* the applicant).
- Deductions: Omitting three required documents (the scorecards), not listing the signed offer sheet as a separate document, and lacking full accuracy in the conditional description and TriVote participation rule are significant errors under strict grading.

**Summary:**  
- Excellent general shape and no hallucinations, but real losses for document omissions and precision of logic, as demanded by the evaluation. Therefore, 6.0.
