4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Evaluating strictly as instructed, with even minor deviations penalized heavily. The LLM answer is assessed holistically against the ground truth for accuracy, completeness, fidelity to the process description, and wording precision. Part (a) has logical equivalence but deviates in phrasing and structure (e.g., contrapositive rewording of the risk rule instead of directly mirroring the process's "if AND skip" condition; awkward retention of "required approvals" contradicting the "any two suffice" rule; table format vs. numbered list). This warrants ~70% accuracy (significant wording/structure mismatches). Part (b) has major omissions and errors: excludes three required input documents (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow, explicitly listed as inputs in step 3 and included in ground truth); fails to list "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document (ground truth separates it from unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" per step 8 wording); conditional qualifier on "Deck Memo" is extraneous and implies optionality not in ground truth; only 5 items vs. 9 in ground truth, with incorrect rationale note dismissing scorecards as non-"deliverables" despite process treating them as required inputs. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions), but incompleteness is severe (~45% accuracy). Overall score reflects weighted average with heavy penalty for b)'s substantive gaps (omitting ~44% of documents).
