3.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +1.0)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions or forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence" or "Compliance Officer"). Task descriptions align closely with the source text while incorporating mandates where required (e.g., "KYC Review" in row 3). However, it does not emphasize "mandated wording" in headers as the ground truth does, and phrasing like "customer's transfer instruction" deviates slightly from the ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction" (-0.5 penalty for minor phrasing inconsistencies).
  
- **Structure and Format (Low Credit, +1.0)**: Markdown table is used correctly with a clear header and legend. However, it omits bolding for **R** and **A** (present in ground truth, -0.5), uses a simpler header ("Task" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)", -0.3), and places the legend at the end rather than integrated below the table (-0.2). More critically, the LLM introduces unnecessary task splitting (5a/5b, 6a/6b), creating 7 rows instead of the ground truth's consolidated 6 tasks (-1.0 for altering the source structure without justification; source treats steps as unified where possible, e.g., release includes SWIFT sending).

- **Role Coverage (Significant Deduction, -2.0)**: The LLM limits columns to three roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), accurately mapping source roles (payment clerk → Transaction Analyst; compliance officer → Regulatory Liaison; IT Support unchanged). However, it completely omits "Operations Manager" (present in ground truth across all rows for accountability), which is a major deviation (-1.5). This results in redistributed R/A assignments that ignore the ground truth's hierarchical structure (e.g., Operations Manager as **A** in nearly every row).

- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Low Credit, +1.0)**: All source tasks are covered without omissions, and the LLM maps them to mandated terminology (e.g., screening by clerk → Transaction Analyst). The addition of "6b. Notify the Regulatory Liaison" explicitly addresses the source's "compliance officer is notified," which the ground truth implicitly folds into "Archive Record" (slight over-interpretation but not inventive, +0.5). However, splitting (e.g., separate SWIFT sending) introduces non-source granularity, and task names are not as precisely rephrased (e.g., "Screen the payment against the sanctions list" vs. ground truth's "Screen Against Sanctions List", -0.5).

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction, -2.0)**: Assignments differ substantially from the ground truth in every row, violating strict fidelity:
  - Row 1: LLM (R,A Analyst; C Liaison; I IT) vs. Ground (R Analyst; I Liaison; **A** Ops; C IT) → Wrong A placement and I/C swap (-0.5).
  - Row 2: LLM (R,A Analyst; C Liaison; I IT) vs. Ground (R Analyst; **A** Liaison; I Ops; C IT) → A on wrong role, C/I swap (-0.5).
  - Row 3: LLM (C Analyst; R,A Liaison; I IT) vs. Ground (C Analyst; **R** Liaison; **A** Ops; I IT) → A on Liaison instead of Ops (-0.5).
  - Row 4: Similar to Row 3, A misplaced (-0.3).
  - Row 5a/5b: LLM splits and assigns R,A to Analyst/IT vs. Ground's consolidated (R Analyst; I Liaison; **A** Ops; C IT) → Structural mismatch and wrong A (-0.5).
  - Row 6a/6b: LLM (I/I/I for archive; R IT for notify) vs. Ground's consolidated (C Analyst; I Liaison; **A** Ops; **R** IT) → Missing C for Analyst, no A on Ops, invented 6b with incomplete I for Liaison (-0.2).
  These errors indicate flawed interpretation of accountability (often placing A on the executor rather than a manager), a core RACI principle mismatched to ground truth.

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness Penalty (-2.0)**: With utmost strictness, the LLM covers the source without invention but deviates in role inclusion, task consolidation, and RACI logic, leading to a table that does not match the ground truth's intent (e.g., no Operations Manager implies incomplete hierarchy). Small errors (e.g., no bolding, phrasing) compound with large ones (assignments, splitting), resulting in ~70% divergence. No criminal/jailbreak issues apply.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts to 3.5 for cumulative mismatches.
