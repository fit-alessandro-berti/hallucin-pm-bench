5.0

The LLM answer mostly follows the vocabulary mandate and presents an organized RACI table, but there are significant discrepancies with the ground truth:

**Major Issues:**
- **Omission of Operations Manager:** The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" role present in the ground truth, which causes major misalignment with the task assignments and accountability structure.
- **Task Decomposition:** The LLM answer splits steps (e.g., 5a/5b and 6a/6b) not indicated in either the prompt or the ground truth. This introduces extraneous distinctions, increasing the risk of incorrect role mapping.
- **Inaccurate Accountability Assignment:** The LLM answer sometimes assigns both Responsible and Accountable (R, A) to the same role (e.g., Transaction Analyst for receiving instructions), whereas the ground truth differentiates these roles (Transaction Analyst = R, Operations Manager = A).
- **Who is Accountable?:** Every task in the ground truth has a clear Accountable (A), typically the Operations Manager or Regulatory Liaison. The LLM answer often lacks a separate accountable party or conflates accountable and responsible.
- **Overuse of Consulted/Informed:** The LLM answer sometimes assigns Consulted (C)/Informed (I) in places not matching the ground truth, likely compensating for the missing Operations Manager column.

**Minor Issues:**
- **Vocabulary:** The answer generally respects vocabulary mandates, using "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst".  
- **Formatting/Clarity:** Markdown table is present and readable, but the split of activities into extremely granular actions (e.g., "Notify the Regulatory Liaison of final disposition") is unnecessary.

**Summary:**  
This answer demonstrates good intent but fails to match the precise mapping, structure, and role assignment of the ground truth, especially around the crucial "Accountable" assignments and inclusion of the Operations Manager. Further, structural divergences (splits, missing roles, multi-role assignments) introduce process ambiguity. These are significant process documentation errors.

**Strictly applied, this is a 5.0.**
