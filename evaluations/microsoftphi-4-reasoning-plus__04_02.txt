The LLM answer correctly identifies all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) matching the ground truth exactly, and the overall result is identical. Justifications are concise (all ≤20 words) and substantially align: R1, R3, R4, and R6 are nearly identical in meaning; R2 captures the post-change approval timing violation effectively; R5 omits mention of Pay_Invoice (focusing only on Ship_Goods), a small but notable gap per strict criteria. However, the response prepends a lengthy, irrelevant internal monologue (~2000+ words) that deviates from the required direct, structured format—no extraneous reasoning is permitted, leading to significant deduction for non-compliance with output instructions.
