**Score: 7.0**

**Evaluation:**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the fact is **not accurate** and cites relevant cases (1001 and 1003), explaining that Update_Inventory occurs before Authorize_Refund, which directly disproves the claim.

**Strengths:**
- Verdict is correct.
- Cites specific case IDs and activity orderings.
- Correctly observes that the order of Authorize_Refund and Update_Inventory is reversed in the provided data.

**Deficiencies (and reason for deduction):**
- The LLM answer omits discussing **Case 1002**, which is directly cited in the ground truth as further disproving the "always" clause, because Update_Inventory never appears. This is an important omission, as considering all evidence in the context is critical.
- The description in Case 1003 is less precise than the ground truth; it implies (but doesn't clearly state) that Update_Inventory is not immediately preceded by Authorize_Refund and adds a detail about Quality_Check, but does not directly state that Authorize_Refund happens after both Update_Inventory and Quality_Check.
- The LLM does not specifically address the "immediately before" aspect with strong clarity in explaining the relevance of intervening activities (like Quality_Check/lack of Update_Inventory).
- The reasoning could be more explicit about the absence of Update_Inventory in Case 1002, which is critical for falsifying an "always" claim.

Given the strict grading guidelines where all missing evidence and imprecision are significant, these omissions and imprecisions warrant a substantial deduction, resulting in a score of **7.0**.
