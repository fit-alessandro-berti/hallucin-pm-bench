7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides a concise, evidence-based justification with accurate citations from Cases 1001 and 1003, highlighting the reversed ordering and lack of immediacy. However, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits Case 1002 entirely, where "Update_Inventory" is absent, which is critical to disproving the "always" claim (as noted in the ground truth). This omission weakens the comprehensiveness of the analysis, especially under strict evaluation criteria requiring full coverage of relevant cases without guessing or partial evidence. The summary statement about activity order "when both are present" is logically sound but sidesteps the absence issue, further reducing the score from a perfect match.
