**Evaluation:**

1. **Manual_Fraud_Check count:**  
LLM: "**1 time**"  
GT: "`1` occurrence"  
→ Completely correct.

2. **Percentage:**  
LLM: "5.56%" with correct calculation shown  
GT: "`5.56 %`" with same calculation  
→ Completely correct.

3. **Case(s) containing Manual_Fraud_Check:**  
LLM: "A1002"  
GT: "Only case **A1002** ..."  
→ Correct.

4. **Two reasons for unreliability:**  
LLM:  
- Small sample size: correctly stated and relevant.  
- Short sampling period: correctly implies temporal bias, although states "single day" rather than the more precise morning of a single day.

GT:  
Accepts "small sample size," "temporal bias," "case-mix bias," and "survivorship/truncation bias." Expects two, clearly stated.

Both of the LLM's reasons are directly covered by the ground truth's acceptable answers. The explanation for "short sampling period" references daily fluctuation and infers that the snippet only covers a day. The log covers, strictly, only a partial day (several hours on May 1, 2025), but the date field shown does not exceed this time frame, so "single day" is not strictly incorrect (though "morning of a single day" would be more specific). The LLM's reasoning is factually correct, though slightly less precise about the time window than ideal.

**Small Deduction for:**  
- Slight lack of specificity in "short sampling period" (says "over a single day" rather than "only the morning"), but not misleading or unjustified.

**No Hallucinations or Unwarranted Inferences.**  
**All questions answered directly and factually.**
