**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment against ground truth):
- **Correct elements (partial credit)**: Affirms **Yes**. Correctly identifies shortcut **T2b** to enable **T5** without **T3** (skips **pc**). Provides correct prefix sequence **T1, T2b, T4, T5** with accurate brief marking evolution. Recognizes lower bound of 4 steps to fire **T5**.
- **Major differences / errors (significant deductions)**:
  - **Wrong firing sequence**: Provides **4-step sequence** ending at **T5**, explicitly states "**T3 never fires at all**", which **fails to demonstrate "T5 before T3"** (requires a sequence containing **both** transitions with **T5** prior to **T3**, per standard interpretation and ground truth). Ground truth uses **6-step sequence** **T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3** via feedback (**T6**) to enable/fire **T3** *after* **T5**.
  - **Misrepresents "shortest"**: Claims 4-step as "**shortest**" for the query, but ground truth proves **6-step is shortest** for full ordering proof (lower bound 4 for **T5**, +2 for post-**T5** **T3** via **T6**, with formal justification). LLM ignores feedback loop (**T6**) entirely.
  - **Incomplete explanation**: No mention of feedback enabling **T3** after **T5**; no minimality proof; no full marking evolution or "why this works" depth.
- **Strictness applied**: ~40% point loss for core mismatch in sequence/justification (not a valid proof of ordering with both fires); minor credit retained for correct **Yes** + prefix/path insight. Differences are substantive, not trivial.
