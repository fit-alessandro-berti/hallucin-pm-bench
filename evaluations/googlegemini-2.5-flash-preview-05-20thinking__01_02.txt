7.5

The LLM answer is generally accurate but not fully precise compared to the ground truth, especially considering the expected strictness. Here is the breakdown:

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three principal decision points using the proper activity names:
  - Underwriter Alignment Gate
  - Amount Threshold Decision
  - Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)

- However:
  - It omits their order and positioning (“branch after the Dual Underwriter Split”, “after Neighbourhood Feedback Check”), which is explicitly present in the ground truth.
  - The explanations are slightly less precise; for example it says “decides whether the application is auto-approved or proceeds to the Micro-loan Board Approval based on the loan amount” but doesn’t mention the cutoff value (€15 000) or that this occurs after the Neighbourhood Feedback Check.
  - “Underwriter Alignment Gate” summary is accurate but ignores specifying the ≤ 2 difference condition.

**Required Documents:**
- All required documents are listed, using the right names and order.
- The LLM omits the note specifying what is *not* required (e.g., credit bureau report, collateral forms, etc.), which is present in the ground truth.
- “CIS template” should just be “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” to match the required format. The inclusion of “template” is a minor deviation.
- Parentheses contents are essentially equivalent (“single pay-stub or tax slip” vs “pay-stub/tax slip”), so this is a minor stylistic difference.

**Overall:**
- The answer captures the essentials, uses the activity names as requested, and does not introduce nonstandard terminology.
- It does lose significant points for not being as exact as the ground truth regarding the process sequence, condition specifics (especially amounts), and for slightly imprecise wording and omission of the negative list.

**Penalties:**  
- *Missing some situational detail or ordering (position in flow, exact conditions):* −1 point  
- *Small imprecision on document naming and lack of exclusion note:* −1 point  
- *Slightly less precise summary explanations at decision points:* −0.5 point

**Final Score:** 7.5
