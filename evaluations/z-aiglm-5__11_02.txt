**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), which align perfectly with ground truth based on standout metrics (e.g., highest wait/rework/SLA). Explanations are strictly table-based, citing precise figures (e.g., 150 min wait, 22.0% rework, 25 min processing, stdev 9, 12.4% SLA, 18 min wait, 3.2% SLA). Actions are concrete, data-driven (tied directly to cited issues like rework/backlog, variance/time, queueing), and numbered clearly. Memo is concise (<150 words), executive-style, no hallucinations or absent activities.
  
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Misses key metrics in explanations: No throughput drop (190 cases/day) for Request_Documents (GT highlights as "balloons"); omits 30 min wait for Review_Documents; skips 12 min processing for Initial_Assessment (GT includes as upstream feeder).
  - Actions solid but less precise/measurable than GT (e.g., LLM: "implement automated... to reduce rework"; GT: "automatic... with validation to cut queueing and *halve* rework"). No quantitative projection (e.g., GT's "≈10% throughput lift, >40% SLA reduction").
  - Minor phrasing: Relative peer comparison ("vs. Check_Coverage") is table-based but extraneous (GT avoids); no intro/outro polish like GT's "isolate hotspots" or overall impact.
  
- **Overall**: Excellent fulfillment (90%+ alignment), but omissions of GT-highlighted metrics and vaguer actions warrant -1.8 point deduction under "utmost strictness" for differences/small errors.
