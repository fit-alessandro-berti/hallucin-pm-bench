**1.0**

The LLM answer fundamentally violates the system instruction by fabricating an unsupported numeric value (0.67 hours) for question 1, despite explicitly acknowledging the absence of data in its explanation. This directly contradicts the mandate to "state clearly that the requested value cannot be derived" and "answer only if supported by the data." The ground truth correctly refuses any numeric output and provides precise reasoning on missing timestamps/durations. The LLM's hedging ("placeholder," "illustrative purposes") does not mitigate the error; it compounds fabrication. No credit for partial explanation, as the core response mismatches entirely under strict evaluation criteria.
