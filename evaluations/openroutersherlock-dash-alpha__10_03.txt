2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer violates multiple strict requirements from the prompt and deviates substantially from the ground truth, warranting a very low score under utmost strictness. Key issues include:

- **Added and renamed activities (major violation)**: The prompt mandates "do not rename, merge, or add activities" while covering "every activity and role described above." The LLM adds four extraneous activities ("Compliance Officer approval," "Treasury Ops scheduling," "Funds release," "Notification") not present in the ground truth, which only includes two additional implied activities ("Compliance Officer Approval," "Release Funds"). This inflates the matrix to 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6, introducing unnecessary splits (e.g., separate "scheduling" and "notification" not in ground truth). Names also mismatch (e.g., "Funds release" vs. "Release Funds"; lowercase "approval" vs. title-case "Approval"). Even the core four activities have formatting inconsistencies (e.g., no bolding on headers as in ground truth).

- **Incorrect RACI assignments (pervasive errors)**: Nearly every cell differs from ground truth, with significant losses for even minor mismatches:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office is R (correct) but misses A; Compliance is A (wrong, should be C); missing Treasury I and Officer –. (Full row mismatch.)
  - **KYC Review**: Compliance misses A (only R); Officer is A (wrong, should be C); missing Treasury I. (Major errors.)
  - **AML Screening**: Identical errors to KYC Review (Compliance misses A; Officer A instead of C; missing Treasury I).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Missing Front-Office C and Treasury I; otherwise partially aligns (Compliance R, Officer A).
  - Added rows compound errors: E.g., "Compliance Officer approval" misses Front-Office I and assigns Treasury C (wrong, should be –); "Funds release" misses Compliance C, Officer C, and Treasury A.
  - Blank cells are used inconsistently vs. ground truth's explicit – for no involvement.
  - "R/A" shorthand is used but not bolded/formatted as **R, A** in ground truth, and applied incorrectly (e.g., Officer is R/A but ground truth specifies R,A separately).

- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit)**: The four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," "Risk Scoring") appear exactly as required, with no disallowed synonyms leaking in. This is the only strong alignment, preventing a 1.0 score.

- **Formatting and completeness**: Markdown table is produced, but lacks ground truth's bolding (e.g., **R, A**), dashes (–), and precise structure. Roles are covered but with incomplete/inaccurate involvement (e.g., many blanks where ground truth has I or C).

Overall, the answer captures the basic structure and vocabulary but fails critically on accuracy, adherence to "do not add" rule, and RACI fidelity—resulting in ~80% deviation from ground truth. Small errors (e.g., missing I/C) alone deduct heavily; cumulative major issues justify 2.0.
