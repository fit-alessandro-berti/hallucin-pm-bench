9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and faithful to the ground truth in content, precisely identifying the data absence (redacted rows and timestamps in Artefact A) as the barrier to computation, without any guessing or external assumptions. It covers all required elements (average cycle time, std dev, 95% CI) and provides a clear, short explanatory paragraph as per task 3. Minor deductions for slight structural differences: the LLM uses numbered points to mirror the task's numbering (which adds clarity but deviates from the ground truth's single-paragraph format) and includes an unnecessary parenthetical note at the end, introducing minimal extraneous phrasing. No factual errors, but utmost strictness penalizes these small deviations in conciseness and format adherence.
