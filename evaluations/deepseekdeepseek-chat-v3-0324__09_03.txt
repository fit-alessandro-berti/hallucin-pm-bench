The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth and correctly states that the requested computations cannot be carried out due to the absence of actual data in Artefact A. It correctly identifies the problem (all concrete data are redacted) and does not attempt to guess or use external information, as required.

Minor deductions (0.5) stem from phrasing: the answer could have more explicitly referenced “cycle time” in its explanation, as in the ground truth ("cycle time nor its dispersion or confidence interval can be calculated"). It says “cycle times or any derived statistics”, which is almost synonymous but just slightly less specific to the asked metric. Otherwise, all key points are addressed, reasoning is accurate, and no unwarranted conclusions are drawn.
