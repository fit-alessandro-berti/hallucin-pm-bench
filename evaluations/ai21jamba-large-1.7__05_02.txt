The LLM answer correctly follows the output format (unified diff with a single hunk and a one-sentence rationale) and adheres to the rules by modifying only an existing attribute without adding/deleting elements, but it fails significantly by targeting the wrong task ("Sign Contract" instead of "Collect Equipment"), applying an incorrect due date change (P3D to P1D versus P5D to P2D), and providing a mismatched rationale that does not reference the implied 3-day SLA or the specific bottleneck addressed in the ground truth, resulting in near-total content divergence.
