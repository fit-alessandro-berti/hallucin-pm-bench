8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer adheres closely to the prompt's core requirements: it correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), accurately quotes both average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim from the table, stays under 150 words (148), and avoids any discussion of service time, throughput, or extraneous activities. The structure is professional and memo-like, with clear sections.

However, strict deductions apply for differences from the ground truth and minor prompt deviations:
- **Action relevance and data-driven nature (-1.0)**: Recommendations are concrete and logically tied to waiting-time reductions (e.g., automation to cut queues/delays), each targeting exactly ≥20% (with calculated averages shown). But they lack the ground truth's explicit "data-driven" backing (e.g., no references to pilots, estimates, or tests; instead, unsubstantiated claims like "to reduce processing time by 20%"). This makes them feel proposed rather than evidence-based, per the prompt's "data-driven" stipulation.
- **Phrasing risks (-0.3)**: Terms like "processing time" and "evaluation time" in recommendations subtly evoke service-time concepts (forbidden by prompt), even if contextually about waiting/delays. Strict interpretation flags this as a small but hazardous error.
- **Format and extras (-0.2)**: More verbose than ground truth's concise bullet style (e.g., added subject line, headers, closing sentence); specifies ranking "by 95th-percentile" unnecessarily (prompt says "by waiting-time" without metric tiebreaker, though rankings match).
- **Correctness and no unwarranted content (full credit)**: Activities, numbers, and exclusions are flawless per scoring notes.

Overall, strong fidelity (90% alignment) but penalized for action invention, lacking evidential ties, and polish issues—resulting in 8.5 under utmost strictness.
