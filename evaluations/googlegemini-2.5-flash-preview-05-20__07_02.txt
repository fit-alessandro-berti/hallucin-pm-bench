9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, but not perfect. Here is a breakdown:

- **Added tasks:** The LLM clearly lists all three added tasks with both name and ID, matching the ground truth.
- **Removed tasks:** The only removed task required is correctly listed, with name and ID.
- **Gateway-type changes:** The change is noted, with both the gateway ID, the change from exclusive to inclusive, and the identification of the gateway by ID. However, the wording is slightly less explicit than the ground truth, which calls out the type change as from "exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)", and specifies the versions ("in v1" and "v2"), but the core information is still present.

**Minor deductions:**  
- The LLM omits the explicit version identification (from v1 to v2) and doesn't include the XOR/OR notation, which means it is slightly less precise and rigorous than the ground truth.  
- The ordering and granularity of details (like using numbers or marking bold for names) is slightly less than the answer key.

Therefore, a one-point deduction (9.0) reflects the absence of some expert-level specificity but recognizes the answer is otherwise strictly accurate, complete, and faithful to instructions.
