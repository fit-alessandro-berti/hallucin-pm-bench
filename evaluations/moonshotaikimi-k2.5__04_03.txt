9.0  
The LLM answer is semantically correct, accurately identifies the sole violation (Rule 3), and references all rules with appropriate justifications. However, under utmost strictness:  
- Rule 1 justification omits explicit confirmation that QE and RA "appear once each" (core part of the rule), only confirming order via positions (incomplete match to ground truth).  
- Paraphrased rule headers (e.g., "QE before RA") simplify/omit elements like "once each".  
- Rule 2 justification omits restating "Severity is High" (present in ground truth).  
- Format uses bullets instead of table; minor wording variances (e.g., "breached" vs. "violated", "reviews" vs. naming QE/RA).  
These small differences (omissions, phrasing, structure) deduct 1.0 despite overall high fidelity.
