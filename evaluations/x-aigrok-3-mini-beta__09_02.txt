The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time for “Dual Authorization” cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps. However, it is missing a minor nuance: it does not explicitly mention that only event counts were provided (as stated in the ground truth). This small omission (i.e., not emphasizing that only event counts are present) is grounds for a minor point deduction under strict evaluation. Otherwise, the answer is concise, accurate, and well-explained in accordance with the prompt constraints.
