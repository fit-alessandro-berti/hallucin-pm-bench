The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides evidence from Cases 1001 and 1003 showing reversed ordering, which partially aligns with the ground truth. However, it omits Case 1002 entirely, failing to note the absence of "Update_Inventory" (a critical disproof of "always" across all cases) and does not address that "Authorize_Refund" never immediately precedes "Update_Inventory" in any case. This incompleteness in evidence coverage and lack of comprehensive case analysis represent significant gaps, warranting a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria. The justification is concise but insufficiently thorough compared to the ground truth's structured, line-cited breakdown of all three cases.
