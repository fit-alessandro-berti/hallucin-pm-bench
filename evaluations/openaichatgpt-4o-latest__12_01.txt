The LLM answer correctly identifies that the fact is inaccurate and provides clear evidence from two relevant cases (1001 and 1003): it cites the actual order of activities, showing that “Update_Inventory” takes place before “Authorize_Refund,” contradicting the claim.

**Points lost (strict evaluation):**
- The answer omits vital evidence from Case 1002. In that case, `Update_Inventory` does not occur at all, immediately disproving “always.” The ground truth highlights this point, while the LLM answer does not mention it.
- The statement "In Case 1001 and Case 1003..." could misleadingly imply that only these two cases are relevant, missing the need to analyze all cases for completeness, as the ground truth does.
- The answer could be even more explicit in stating that there is never an immediate "Authorize_Refund" → "Update_Inventory" sequence.

**Conclusion:** While the answer is mostly accurate and well reasoned from the data given, omission of Case 1002 (which is critical) and partial contextual coverage subtracts two points.
