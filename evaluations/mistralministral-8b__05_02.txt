The LLM answer fails significantly on multiple fronts under strict evaluation: (1) it does not provide a proper unified diff in single-hunk format (instead outputting the entire modified XML without -/+ lines or @@ context, violating the output rules); (2) it alters the dueDate to "P3D" instead of the ground truth's "P2D," introducing an incorrect specific change; (3) the rationale vaguely mentions shortening duration for SLA enhancement but omits the key details of the 3-day contractual SLA and precise cycle control, reducing its alignment; these cumulative errors (format as the most severe) warrant a very low score despite correctly targeting the same task.
