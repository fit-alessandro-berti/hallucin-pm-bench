6.0

The LLM answer correctly applies exactly one improvement, solely modifies an attribute, and follows the diff and rationale format. However, there are notable deviations from the ground truth:

- It reduces the `camunda:dueDate` from `P5D` to `P3D`, not the correct `P2D` as specified in the ground truth.
- The rationale incorrectly claims that the change puts the process within the SLAâ€”reducing to `P3D` still risks SLA breach (as per the ground truth, only `P2D` is acceptable given the cumulative durations).
- The diff is well-formed and minimally scoped, maintaining a single hunk.
- No forbidden element or flow changes occur.

These errors are significant: the proposed deadline reduction does not achieve full SLA compliance as required, and the rationale is therefore inaccurate. For these reasons, the answer loses notable points, but demonstrates a mostly correct method.
