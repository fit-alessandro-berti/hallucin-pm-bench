**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it answers **No** to Q1 (ground truth: **Yes**) and provides flawed reasoning instead of a correct minimal firing sequence for Q2. Key errors include misunderstanding that T3 requires only P2 (not P1, which T2 consumes independently), falsely claiming mutual exclusivity between paths to P4/P5 and T3, and ignoring the valid sequence T1→T2→T7→T4→T5 where T5 fires with P2(1)+P5(1) intact pre-T3. Explanation exceeds ~120-word limit (~250 words). No alignment with ground truth; total failure.
