**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the deterministic ground truth exactly (count=1, 2a=2.08%, 2b=8.33%, with correct calculations shown). For 3, it stays ≤100 words (~70), uses only log data (e.g., C05 ~1h vs. C01/C02/C11 >24h spans), and covers all required elements: (i) single occurrence ("single instance"/"single data point"), (ii) variance/instability ("biased"/"overfitting"/cannot determine outlier vs. standard), (iii) over-generalization caution (explicitly warns against inferring manual > auto efficiency). No inventions, no errors, grounded in "performance or predictive analyses." Minor formatting diffs (e.g., % spacing) are insignificant.
