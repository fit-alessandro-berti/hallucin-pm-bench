9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h/120.0h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quotes figures verbatim from the table, stays under 150 words (approx. 110), omits all non-waiting metrics, and provides one concrete, relevant action per activity that logically targets waiting-time delays while promising ≥20% reduction (e.g., automation/AI/templating tied to process data). No invented unsupported data appears. Minor deductions for: (1) indirect reference to other activities ("No other activities exceed 5h avg."), violating the "mention only these three" intent; (2) extraneous execution-range mention (255–275, pulled from table but unrequested); (3) stylistic differences from ground truth's ultra-concise list format, with fully different (though equally valid) actions. These are small but warrant a strict 1.0-point loss from perfection.
