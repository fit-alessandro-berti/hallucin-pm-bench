**Evaluation of LLM Answer vs. Ground Truth:**

**Positives:**
- Correctly identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities by average waiting time: Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability.
- Accurately quotes both average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each.
- Proposes one action per activity, each aiming to reduce waiting time by ≥20%.
- Does not mention irrelevant metrics like service time or throughput.
- Clear memo format, suitable for executives.

**Errors/Point Deductions:**
- **Actions partly misaligned:** The suggested actions are more generic and not as tightly tailored or directly data-backed as the ground truth. For instance:
    - For Request_Documents, the ground truth specifies automated customer reminders with escalation, while the LLM answer only suggests automated triggers to third-party portals (not directly linked to customer reminders or escalation for lagging submissions).
    - For Send_Closure_Letter, ground truth calls for e-signature letters on closure (directly replacing batch printing); the LLM answer suggests "templated, auto-sent closure letters," which is close but does not specify the same-day aspect or the operational shift from batch to on-demand e-signature.
    - For Assess_Liability, ground truth recommends a rules-engine for automatic classification, while the LLM answer suggests an AI-assisted scoring engine. The LLM’s proposal is broader and less targeted at bypassing queues.
- **Memo extras:** The closing sentence ("Each action targets... No other activities exceed 5h avg.") is not in the ground truth and includes comparison to other activities, which the ground truth explicitly prohibits.
- **Verbosity:** The memo is essentially within the word limit but could be tighter.
- **Wording variance:** The LLM does not quote waiting-time figures verbatim as instructed ("avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h" vs. "Avg 36.5h (95p: 120.0h)"). This deviation, while minor, still reflects some loss in fidelity.

**Overall:**  
The answer delivers the required information and reasoning but with some generic action wording and mild rule breaches. The cumulative effect of these variances justifies a strict 3-point penalty.
