**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in nearly every aspect, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Structure**: Horizontal RACI (Task | R | A | C | I) vs. ground truth's vertical (Task | Role1 | Role2 | Role3 | Role4 with letters). No legend provided.
- **Roles**: Uses KYC Review *as a role* (misapplication; it's an activity). Includes IT Support but omits Operations Manager. Misaligns entirely with ground truth columns.
- **Tasks**: 6 rows but wording mismatches (e.g., "Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**"; "Archive case file and notify compliance officer" vs. "Archive Record"). Combines unrelated steps (e.g., release + SWIFT). Retains forbidden "compliance officer".
- **Assignments**: Zero row-by-row R/A/C/I matches (e.g., first task: LLM R=Transaction Analyst/A=Regulatory Liaison vs. GT R=Transaction Analyst/A=Operations Manager).
- **Vocabulary**: Partial use of mandates but violates with "compliance officer"; does not strictly enforce "mandated wording" in tasks as ground truth does (e.g., no bolded "**KYC Review**" as activity).
- **Completeness**: Covers steps but introduces errors/omissions in mapping (e.g., IT Support handling archive + notify incorrectly phrased).

No significant alignment; multiple violations and inventions make it non-compliant.
