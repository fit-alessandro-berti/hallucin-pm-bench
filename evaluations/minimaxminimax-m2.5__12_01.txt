**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in verdict (false/inaccurate), coverage of all cases, key observations (reversal in 1001, absence in 1002, reversal/separation in 1003 disproving "always" and "immediately before"), and evidence from sequences/case IDs/activities. Stylistic differences (table vs. bullets, no line citations, phrasing like "separated by another activity" vs. "not after it") are minor enhancements or equivalents that comply fully with the prompt's requirements for a short, evidence-based justification without errors, guesses, or omissions. Utmost strictness applied: zero substantive differences or small errors.
