9.0

**Assessment:**

1. **Q1:** The LLM correctly states that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs once. (Full credit)
2. **Q2:** The LLM gives the correct percentage calculation (5.56%) and shows calculation steps. (Full credit)
3. **Q3:** The case identifier "A1002" is correct. (Full credit)
4. **Q4:** The first point—small sample size—is clear and correct.  
     The second point, mentioning "non-representative cases," is valid and very close to ground truth. However, the answer does not explicitly mention "temporal bias" or "survivorship/truncation bias." While "non-representative cases" can be interpreted as case-mix bias, the explanation only notes skewness due to only one case featuring the activity, rather than elaborating on potential sampling biases (e.g., time window or possible omitted cases of other types).

**Difference to ground truth:**  
- The main shortcoming is Q4, where the reasoning, though sufficient, is slightly less precise and thorough than ideal, omitting some sampling biases explicitly recommended in the ground truth (such as temporal or survivorship bias).  
- All numbers and identifications are accurate, and there are no hallucinations or assumptions outside the 18 lines.

**Deduction:**  
Due to the slight imprecision and lack of explicit mention of some bias types in Q4, 1 point is deducted.

**Final score:** 9.0
