### Evaluation Breakdown
This evaluation is based on a strict comparison to the ground truth, penalizing any deviations in accuracy, completeness, phrasing, or inference beyond the provided log. The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, with minimal issues, but loses a small amount for phrasing nuances and slight elaboration in reasoning that borders on interpretation (though still grounded).

- **Question 1**: Matches ground truth exactly in substance ("once" ≡ "1 occurrence"). No loss. (Full points)
- **Question 2**: Exact match on value ("5.56%"), includes correct calculation, and follows rounding rule. Minor spacing difference ("5.56%" vs. "5.56 %") is negligible but noted under strictness. (Full points)
- **Question 3**: Substantively identical ("A1002" listed as the only case). Ground truth adds "Only case" for emphasis, and prompt uses plural "identifier(s)", but LLM's singular phrasing is accurate given the data. No significant deviation. (Full points)
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, sampling-related reasons. "Small sample size" directly matches a ground truth example. "Non-representative cases" (citing the 4-case skew and lack of distribution) aligns closely with "Case-mix bias" in the ground truth, as both address non-representativeness of the selected cases relative to the population. However, it rephrases slightly (e.g., emphasizes "skewed distribution" over "high-risk segments") and lacks the quantitative detail in the ground truth example (e.g., variance via ±5.56 pp.), which under utmost strictness deducts marginally for not being verbatim in elaboration. No hallucination, as both reasons derive directly from log details (18 events, 4 cases, 1 occurrence). (-0.2 points total)

Overall score reflects near-perfect adherence: correct counts, no inferences beyond the log, and valid reasoning for Q4. The minor deduction ensures strictness for any non-exact match in reasoning depth/phrasing.
