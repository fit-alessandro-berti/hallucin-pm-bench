### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt by using the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") correctly in tasks and roles, and it produces a Markdown RACI table covering process steps. However, under strict evaluation, it incurs significant point deductions for multiple deviations from the ground truth:

- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The table has only 3 role columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting the "Operations Manager" column present in the ground truth. It expands to 8 tasks (adding "Send SWIFT message", "Archive case file", and "Notify on case archival" as separate rows), while the ground truth consolidates into 6 rows with different phrasing (e.g., "Archive Record" instead of separate archive/notify; no SWIFT row). This introduces unsubstantiated splits and omissions in coverage alignment.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: Assignments diverge substantially across nearly all rows. For example:
  - "KYC Review": LLM assigns Consulted (Analyst), Accountable (Liaison), Informed (IT)â€”critically, no Responsible role is assigned, violating RACI principles (every task needs an R). Ground truth has Responsible (Liaison), Accountable (Operations Manager).
  - "Approve High-Risk Transactions": Similarly, no Responsible in LLM (only Consulted/Accountable/Informed); ground truth assigns Responsible (Liaison).
  - "Screen Against Sanctions List": LLM has Consulted (Liaison) vs. ground truth's Accountable (Liaison); IT is Informed (LLM) vs. Consulted (ground).
  - Other rows (e.g., Receive, Release) show partial overlaps but inconsistencies in Informed/Consulted roles and missing Operations Manager inputs.
  These errors misrepresent accountability and responsibility, especially for high-risk steps, leading to incomplete/inaccurate mapping of the informal description.

- **Additional Content and Formatting (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: The LLM includes an extraneous "Explanation of RACI Assignments" section not present in the ground truth, which adds unrequested verbosity. Task phrasings differ slightly (e.g., "Conduct KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. ground truth's concise "**KYC Review**"), and the ground truth uses a bolded "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header with a separate Legend, which the LLM lacks.

Overall, while the LLM captures the core intent and mandated terms without fabricating new vocabulary, the cumulative differences in structure, completeness, and accuracy result in a low score. Small errors (e.g., phrasing, legend absence) compound with larger ones (missing role, incomplete RACI) for strict penalty.
