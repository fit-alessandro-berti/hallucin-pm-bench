8.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core content accuracy (perfect, no factual errors):** +10.0 base. Correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks (`Quality_Check` & `Update_Inventory`; `Generate_Replenishment_Report` & `Notify_Procurement`), in correct order, focused solely on Process B, no mention of A/C.
- **Numbering and structure:** Matches (numbered 1-2 sets in order). Minor deduction for not using "Set X" phrasing (-0.3).
- **Labeling:** Uses precise "Parallel Split #1/#2" from process description (arguably better), but differs from ground truth's "Set 1 – first parallel block" (-0.4).
- **Formatting of tasks:** Bulleted lists vs. inline `task` ‖ `task` (-0.5).
- **Extra introductory sentence:** Unnecessary repetition of process name and query phrasing (not in ground truth) (-0.3).
- **Missing closing sentence:** Omits "No other tasks... can run in parallel" (-0.3).

Total deductions: -1.8 from perfect 10.0. Utmost strictness applied to all presentational and textual differences.
