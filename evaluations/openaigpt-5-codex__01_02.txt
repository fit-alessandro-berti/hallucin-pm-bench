### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
While the LLM answer captures the core elements of the decision points and document list, it deviates from the ground truth in structure, precision, and completeness, warranting a significant deduction under strict criteria. Key differences:

#### Decision Points (Major Structural and Detail Errors, ~40% Loss)
- **Extra/Improper Separation**: The LLM treats "Harmonisation Committee" as a standalone decision point, but the ground truth integrates it as an escalation *within* the Underwriter Alignment Gate (e.g., "escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break"). This inflates the list to 4 items vs. ground truth's 3, violating the summarized flow and introducing redundancy.
- **Missing Contextual Flow**: Ground truth specifies precise branches (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"; exact condition phrasing like "If Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B scores differ by ≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate"). LLM omits these, using vaguer descriptions (e.g., "compares the risk scores... if differ by more than 2 points, the case is escalated" without naming underwriters or exact ≤2 threshold phrasing).
- **Phrasing Inconsistencies**: Minor but penalized strictly—e.g., "amounts under €15 000" vs. exact "< €15 000"; "advance to the Micro-loan Board" vs. "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval"; "approve or reject vote" vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**" (capitalized emphasis). No mention of "system auto-approves" verbatim.
- **Formatting**: Bullets vs. ground truth's numbered list with detailed conditionals; lacks the hierarchical, process-oriented summary style.

#### Required Documents (Minor Phrasing Errors, ~20% Loss)
- **Exact Matches but Additions/Omissions**: List is complete and uses exact names, but LLM retains system prompt details like "(≤ 3 months old)", "(single pay-stub or tax slip)", and "(CIS) template", while ground truth simplifies to "(≤ 3 months)", "(pay-stub/tax slip)", and "(CIS)". These are small deviations but count as errors in strict verbatim matching.
- **Missing Note**: Ground truth includes an explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), which reinforces the non-standard process. LLM omits this, reducing fidelity.
- **Formatting**: Bullets vs. numbered list; no bolding or structure matching ground truth.

Overall, the answer is functionally correct and adheres to the prompt's "exact terminology" rule (no standard loan terms introduced), but the structural inaccuracies in decision points and subtle phrasing mismatches prevent a higher score. Core content alignment is ~70-80%, but strictness demands deduction for every deviation.
