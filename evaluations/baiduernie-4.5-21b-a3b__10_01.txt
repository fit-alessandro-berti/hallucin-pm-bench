2.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Compliance (Major Violation, -4.0 points)**: The LLM answer fails the strict vocabulary policy by using the forbidden term "Customer Due Diligence" (appears in table and notes). Only two of the three mandated terms ("Order Vetting" and "Payment Clearance") are used correctly; "KYC Review" is entirely absent. Even minor mentions of forbidden terms are prohibited, leading to severe deduction.
- **RACI Matrix Correctness (Major Errors, -3.0 points)**: All allocations deviate significantly from the ground truth. Examples:
  - Receive Application: LLM assigns R (AM), A (CO); ground truth is R/A (AM), C (CO).
  - KYC Review (mislabeled): LLM assigns A (AM), C (CO); ground truth is A (AM), R (CO), C (FC).
  - Order Vetting: LLM assigns R (AM), A (CO); ground truth is R/A (AM), C (CO).
  - Payment Clearance: LLM assigns I (AM), A (CO), R (FC); ground truth is A (AM), C (CO), R (FC).
  - Record Update: LLM assigns R (AM), C (IT); ground truth is C (AM), R (IT).
  - Notify Customer: LLM assigns R (AM), A (CO); ground truth is R/A (AM), I (CO).
  No activity has exactly one Responsible as per narrative; Accountable roles for AM are mishandled. Small errors (e.g., inconsistent I/A assignments) compound this.
- **Formatting and Structure (Minor but Cumulative Errors, -0.5 points)**: Table headers include abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), unlike ground truth's full names. Bold formatting for key roles (e.g., **R**) is missing. Irrelevant prefix "יב" appears (likely artifact/error).
- **Unwarranted Content (Minor Violation, -0.5 points)**: Includes explanatory notes that contradict the table (e.g., notes claim I for CO in Receive Application, but table shows A) and add unsolicited details ("Let me know if you need adjustments!"). Ground truth has no notes, introducing extras without justification.
- **Overall Adherence to Prompt (Holistic, Starting from 10.0)**: Prompt demands strict adherence to terminology and process narrative. Cumulative differences (5/6 activities wrong, terminology breach) make this response fundamentally non-compliant, reflecting near-total deviation from ground truth. No self-awareness issues apply, but no partial credit for intent.
