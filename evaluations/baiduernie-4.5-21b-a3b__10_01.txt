The answer fails in several major areas:

1. **Terminology violations**: The required strict synonyms—**KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance**—are not consistently used. E.g., it uses "Customer Due Diligence" and not "KYC Review" for the second step—a direct violation of the stringent vocab policy. Some preferred terms ("Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are used, but only partially.

2. **Process Mapping Errors**:
   - The role allocations (*Responsible*, *Accountable*, *Consulted*, *Informed*) do not consistently match the ground truth. For example:
      - For "Receive Application", the answer splits R/A oddly between AM and CO, whereas the ground truth is **R/A for AM only**.
      - For "Record Update", the answer makes AM "Responsible" and CO "Accountable", whereas ground truth is **R for IT**, etc.
      - For "Notify Customer", the answer makes AM "Responsible", but "Accountable" is also given to CO—which is incorrect; AM should be R/A.

3. **Table Structure**: The LLM answer splits out "Customer Due Diligence" and "Order Vetting" as separate steps rather than using the required synonym ("KYC Review" instead of "Customer Due Diligence"). This causes terminology and mapping errors.

4. **Formatting Issues**: The use of both table and "Notes" is fine stylistically, but several allocations in the notes do not even match the table rows (e.g., responsibility/accountability swaps).

5. **No Extra Content**: At least no extra activities or roles are introduced.

**Summary**: The LLM answer is only partial credit: it sometimes applies the special terms, but fails the strict terminology mandate and misassigns RACI statuses, indicating only basic comprehension. Therefore, a severe deduction is warranted.
