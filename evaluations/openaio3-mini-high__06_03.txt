The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets in the exact order required, matching the core content of the ground truth. However, it loses points for several small but notable deviations under strict evaluation: (1) uses plain "and" instead of the explicit parallelism notation "‖" to denote branches; (2) omits descriptive headers (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**") that clarify the structure; (3) lacks backticks or formatting for task names; (4) does not include the confirmatory sentence about no other parallel tasks. These formatting and precision issues, while minor, warrant a significant deduction per the strictness criteria.
