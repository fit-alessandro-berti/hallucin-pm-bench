7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h p95; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quoting figures verbatim from the table. It stays within ~120 words, avoids service times/throughput/other activities, and provides one concrete action per activity tied to reducing waits. No unwarranted content.

However, significant deductions for differences from ground truth:
- **Actions lack data-driven specificity**: LLM's recommendations (e.g., "automate initial document request") are logical and automation-focused but generic, without ground truth's evidence-based phrasing (e.g., "pilot tests show â‰¥25% cut," "estimated 30% reduction"). This violates the "data-driven" requirement, treating actions as unsubstantiated suggestions rather than backed proposals (-1.5 points).
- **Format and style divergence**: Full memo header and introductory prose add fluff; ground truth is ultra-concise bullets without headers or descriptors like "staggering" (-0.5 points).
- **Aggregate vs. per-action claims**: LLM claims "over 20%" globally at the end, not per-activity as implied in ground truth's targeted estimates (-0.5 points).

Strict scoring reflects these as more than minor errors, pulling from a potential 10.0 despite factual accuracy.
