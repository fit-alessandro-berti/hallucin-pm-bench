7.0

The LLM answer gets most key elements right: it identifies and ranks the top three activities (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability) strictly by waiting time, reports both the average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim as in the source data, and offers one concrete action per activity focused on reducing waiting times.

However, there are notable issues:

1. **Action Specificity and Data-Driven Rigor:**
   - The proposed actions for each activity are plausible but are *less concrete and data-driven* than in the ground truth (e.g., "Automate the initial document request" vs. "automated customer reminders with 24 h escalation triggers" and citing test results).
   - There are *no quantitative estimates* (e.g., "≥25 % cut", "estimated 30 % wait-time reduction") supporting the effectiveness of the proposed interventions—this is a significant shortcoming versus the ground truth.
   - The action for "Assess_Liability" (automated, skill-based routing) is a generally reasonable idea, but not as targeted or as operationally specific as "rules-engine pre-classification so simple cases bypass senior adjuster queue."

2. **Minor Deviations in Activities' Presentation:**
    - The LLM answer adds prose about these activities "bottlenecking our claims process," which, while stylistically acceptable, is not strictly necessary, especially since strict adherence and economy of words is required.
    - The memo header adds extra elements (TO, FROM, SUBJECT) which, while not incorrect, use words that could otherwise contribute to the 150-word limit for substantive content.

3. **Minor Wording Differences:**
    - The numbers for waiting times are directly quoted and correct.
    - The activities are correctly limited to the required set.

4. **Promise on ≥20% Reduction:**
   - The answer claims these automations "can cut these specific waits by over 20%"—but does not give any evidence or specific, data-driven backing for those claims as the ground truth does.

**Summary:** 
Correct activities and stats, but loses significant points for lack of data-backed action efficacy, less precise action recommendations, and failing to mention effectiveness percentages. These issues justify a strict score deduction to 7.0.
