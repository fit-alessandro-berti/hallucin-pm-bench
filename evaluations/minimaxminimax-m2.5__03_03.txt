4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer captures the overall process logic correctly and adheres to prompt requirements like wrc_ ID prefixes, verbatim task names (where matching), exactly 2 end events, specified gateways, and no invented elements beyond the text. However, under utmost strictness against the ground truth, it incurs **major deductions** for:

- **Extra/hallucinated task and flow (significant loss: -3.0 points)**: Includes `wrc_checkWarrantyEligibility` task and `wrc_flow6` not in ground truth (15 flows vs. 16). This alters the sequence (complete GW → warranty GW directly in ground truth vs. inserted task in LLM), making it semantically non-equivalent despite textual mention of "checks warranty eligibility" (ground truth treats GW as proxy for step 3 decision, per "minimal-yet-complete").
- **XML structure/namespace mismatch (significant loss: -1.5 points)**: Uses default namespace (`<task>`) vs. ground truth's prefixed (`<bpmn:task>`), plus extra `xmlns` for DI/DC/BPMNDI and full `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` section (omitted in ground truth). Not identical self-contained XML.
- **Element ID/name/flow label differences (moderate loss: -1.0 point)**: All IDs differ beyond whitespace (e.g., `wrc_validateClaim` vs. `wrc_validate`; `wrc_endSuccess`/"Successful Completion" vs. `wrc_end_success`/"Successful end"). GW/flow names differ (e.g., "Claim Complete?" vs. "Claim complete?"; "Complete"/"Within warranty" vs. "Yes"/"No"). Process `name` added. Parallel GWs named unnecessarily.
- **Minor issues (cumulative -0.5 point)**: Capitalization inconsistencies, extra process `name`, different `definitions` attributes (`id`, `targetNamespace`).

Base 10.0 → 4.0 total. Semantically close but not equivalent due to extra elements/flow changes; numerous small diffs compound under strict rubric.
