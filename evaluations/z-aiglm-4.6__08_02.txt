The LLM answer is factually correct, provides the same minimal sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, and accurately describes the bypass via the P1-P3-P4 path while leaving the P2 token intact. The final marking {P2, P5} is correctly identified, enabling T5.

Minor deductions for lacking step-by-step markings (as in ground truth), omitting the post-T5 disabling of T3 (which confirms irreversibility but isn't strictly required), and slightly less structured formatting—resulting in minor differences in presentation and detail depth under strict evaluation. Explanation is concise (under 120 words) with no factual errors.
