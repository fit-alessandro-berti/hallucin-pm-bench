**4.0**

### Evaluation (strict assessment):
- **Major functional error (-4.0 points)**: Missing `cancelActivity="true"` on the boundary event, making it non-interrupting by default. This fails to enforce the SLA, as "Create Account" would continue past 48h without cancellation/escalation enforcement, unlike ground truth.
- **Minor XML inconsistencies (-1.0 point)**: Lacks `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (inconsistent with prompt/ground truth style); different ID/name attributes (functional but deviates).
- **Justification issues (-1.0 point)**: Omits "interrupting" (critical for enforcement), says "existing" vs. "pre-existing", and "triggers an escalation path if exceeds" implies enforcement it doesn't achieve without interruption.
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies timer boundary on "Activity_CreateAccount", reuses existing "Activity_AMReview" via sequence flow, adheres to "no new activities", and provides one-sentence justification in correct format. Overall ~60% match, but critical flaws warrant low score under utmost strictness.
