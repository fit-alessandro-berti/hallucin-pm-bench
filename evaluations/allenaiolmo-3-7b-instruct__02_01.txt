**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring):
- **Q1**: Exact match (3) → full credit.
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items") → full credit.
- **Q3**: Incorrect ("2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00" vs. ground truth "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00"). Clear error in identifying the earliest timestamp (A-9321 Receive_Order at 08:02). Significant deduction.
- **Q4**: Exact match (2) → full credit.
- **Q5**: Completely incorrect list. LLM lists ["Receive_Order", "Pack_Items", "Quality_Check"] (includes activities that *do* appear first: Receive_Order, Quality_Check; only Pack_Items correct but in wrong context). Ground truth: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] (all that *never* start cases). Major semantic error and no overlap in validity → zero credit.

**Overall**: 3/5 questions correct (60% base), but strict policy demands heavy penalty for factual errors (Q3 timestamp miss, Q5 inversion/misread of "never first"). Q5 error compounds as multi-item mismatch. No format issues, but content differences yield **4.0** (partial for correct subset, major losses elsewhere).
