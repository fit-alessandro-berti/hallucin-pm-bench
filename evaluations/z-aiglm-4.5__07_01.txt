7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: two added tasks with exact names from XML (`Check Customer VIP Status` and `Generate RMA QR Code`), one removed task with exact name (`Send RMA Label`), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive. Headings match the prompt exactly (using â€¢ bullets). No speculation or extraneous content; concise and factual.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Omits IDs for all tasks (e.g., no `check_vip` or `generate_qr` in added, no `send_rma_label` in removed), which are factual elements directly from the XML and included in ground truth for precision. This is a notable omission (-1.5 points).
  - For gateway changes, uses the human-readable name (`Warranty Valid?`) instead of the XML ID (`gw_valid`), abbreviates types (`exclusive`/`inclusive` vs. full `exclusiveGateway`/`inclusiveGateway`), and lacks version specifics ((v1)/(v2)). This reduces exactness (-1.0 points).
  - Minor formatting differences: No markdown (bold headings, bullets, italics) as in ground truth, and no trailing note (e.g., "(No other differences should be reported.)"), though prompt doesn't mandate it. Still, deviates from ground truth structure (-0.0 for formatting, as it's secondary).
- Overall: High fidelity to core facts (80% match), but strict criteria penalize omissions of XML-derived details like IDs and precise terminology, leading to incomplete alignment with ground truth. No category is wrong, but differences are evident and non-trivial.
