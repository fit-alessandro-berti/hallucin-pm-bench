### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, ~3/10)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified for the core activities, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). However, the added activities ("Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Notification") introduce unauthorized phrasings without adhering to any policy, violating the "using only the authorized vocabulary" rule.
  
- **Activities Coverage (Major Deduction, ~1/10)**: The prompt mandates covering "every activity and role described above" without renaming, merging, or adding. The ground truth identifies five precise activities (the four mandated plus "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"), directly mapping the narrative without extras. The LLM adds four extraneous activities ("Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Notification"), renames "Compliance Officer Approval" to generic "Approval", splits "Release Funds" unnecessarily, and fabricates "Payment Scheduling" and "Notification" as separate rows. This inflates the matrix beyond the described process, a clear violation.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction, ~1/10)**: Assignments diverge substantially from the ground truth, indicating misinterpretation of responsibilities:
  - Intake Vetting: Misses Consulted (C) for Compliance Analyst and Informed (I) for Treasury Ops.
  - KYC Review & AML Screening: Overstates Compliance Analyst as both R and A; omits C for Compliance Officer and I for Treasury Ops.
  - Risk Scoring: Incorrectly assigns R/A solely to Compliance Analyst with conditional I; ground truth has nuanced C/R/A split across roles without conditions.
  - Added rows have no ground truth equivalents, so all are erroneous (e.g., "Approval" vaguely assigns R/A to Officer, ignoring narrative escalation specifics).
  - No use of dashes (–) for no involvement; instead, uses blanks, and introduces unprompted conditions like "(if high score)".

- **Format and Structure (Partial Credit, ~4/10)**: Markdown table is used, which is correct. Combines R/A logically (similar to ground truth's "R, A"), but adds an unprompted title ("# RACI Matrix...") and legend, bloating the output beyond "Return the matrix as a Markdown table." Lacks ground truth's bolding (** ) on activities and entries, and uses slashes (R/A) vs. commas (R, A). Blanks instead of – for no involvement reduce clarity.

- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the core strength (mandated terms for four activities) is undermined by additions, renamings, and assignment errors, which fundamentally alter the matrix's fidelity to the prompt and narrative. Small issues like format inconsistencies and extras compound to significant deviations, warranting a low score despite partial adherence. No criminal or jailbreak issues apply.
