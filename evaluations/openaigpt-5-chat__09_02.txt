The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the lack of timestamps, which is the key and essential reason. However, it could be slightly improved for precision by explicitly stating that only event counts are available and that duration (start-to-completion intervals) is therefore absent. The answer is fully correct, but slightly less detailed and explicit than the ground truth, hence the point deduction.
