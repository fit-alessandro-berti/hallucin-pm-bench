9.5

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in correctly answering "No" and identifying the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 reversal and C005 line 11 lacking Receive_Order), with precise line and case citations that disprove the "always" claim. It adheres to the "one paragraph" justification format better than the ground truth's bulleted structure. Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary addition of positive examples (C001, C002, C004), which deviates from the ground truth's concise focus on counterexamples only (-0.3); (2) slightly less emphatic phrasing on "**not always**" (e.g., no explicit "prove that... does not always"); (3) inclusion of irrelevant line 4 (Check_Inventory) in C002 range and use of "corresponding" instead of "never contains" (-0.2 total for stylistic/wording variances). No factual errors.
