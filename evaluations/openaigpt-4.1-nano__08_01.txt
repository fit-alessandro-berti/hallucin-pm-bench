The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, reversing the ground truth conclusion (claiming "No" impossibility when the correct answer is "Yes" possibility). It fails to identify the valid firing sequence T1 → T2 → T5 → T3, misunderstanding T5's enabling condition (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0) after T2 but before T3. The provided "proof" contains multiple logical errors, such as incorrectly stating T5 requires T3 to have fired first and ignoring the independent paths from p1 (to T2 → p3) and p2 (to T3 → p4). This total mismatch warrants the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria, as the error is not minor but a complete failure to analyze the net's behavior.
