**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Grading per Instructions and Rubric)
The LLM answer is a valid, self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML that semantically models the process correctly per the prompt, including **all explicitly mentioned flow elements** (8 tasks verbatim from desc, required gateways, loop for re-validation, parallel branches, 2 end events, wrc_ ID prefix). It improves on ground truth by including the explicitly required "**checks warranty eligibility**" task (omitted in ground truth, which skips it and connects complete_gw directly to warranty_gw— a semantic omission per desc step 3).

However, **utmost strictness** mandates significant deductions for differences from ground truth XML (per "more differences = lower grade") and rubric (deduct for **extra** elements/flows):
- **Extra task + flows (major deduction -1.5)**: Includes "checks warranty eligibility" task + 2 flows (valid per prompt/desc, but absent in ground truth, making graph non-equivalent).
- **Extra/hallucinated DI section (major -1.5)**: Full <bpmndi:BPMNDiagram> with ~80 lines of shapes/edges/waypoints (arbitrary layout not required/mentioned; ground truth is minimal model-only).
- **Name differences (moderate -0.5)**: Task/start/end/gw/flow names differ (e.g., start "online warranty claim" vs "Online warranty claim submitted"; ends "Claim Closed" vs "Successful end"; cases like "validates the claim" verbatim vs capitalized; added gw/flow names).
- **Structural/style differences (minor -0.3)**: <incoming>/<outgoing> lists (redundant to sourceRef/targetRef); more namespaces; descriptive IDs (e.g., "wrc_TaskChecksWarrantyEligibility" vs simple "wrc_xxx"); process name added.
- **No omissions**: Has all ground truth elements + more (no penalty).

Semantically ~90% equivalent (correct flow/logic), but XML/structure differs enough for non-perfect score. Full credit impossible due to extras/diffs; not 10.0 (not identical/semantically identical). Not <5.0 (fundamentally correct to prompt, not broken/invented paths).
