The LLM answer accurately identifies all changes: the three added tasks with correct names and IDs, the one removed task correctly, and the precise gateway type change using XML element names (which directly matches the BPMN XML diffs). Content is complete and faithful to the prompt's requirements (ignoring renamings like "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan" and gateway name changes). Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for stylistic differences from ground truth: bulleted vs. numbered lists, parentheses vs. backticks for IDs, lack of markdown bolding/italics/semantics like "(XOR)/(OR)" or "v1/v2" phrasing, retained example text in one heading, and absence of the confirmatory note/header. No factual errors or omissions; extremely close match under strict scrutiny.
