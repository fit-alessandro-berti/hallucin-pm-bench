- The LLM answer gives the correct count and names in A1, correct answer in A2, and the correct once-only activity in A3.
- Minor issues:
  - In A1, LLM redundantly lists the case names (fine), but puts them in parentheses, not matching the "bullet, colon, answer" structure of the ground truth, which is a tiny formatting inconsistency.
  - In A2, answer formatting is slightly different ("For C456, 'Pack_Items' immediately precedes 'Ship_Order'.") instead of just "Pack_Items".
  - In A3, answer includes extraneous quotation marks, and uses "appears..." instead of just the activity name.
- All information content is correct, but strict criteria demand a deduction for not matching concise, minimal style.
