8.5

- Q1: Correct count and cases listed, but minor differences in wording ("distinct cases" vs. "cases") and order of cases; slight deduction for not matching exact phrasing.
- Q2: Correct activity, but overly verbose full sentence instead of concise single term; significant deduction for lack of strict conciseness.
- Q3: Correct activity, but adds explanatory phrase ("appears exactly once") instead of just the name; deduction for verbosity. Overall content accurate, but format/conciseness deviations reduce score under strict evaluation.
