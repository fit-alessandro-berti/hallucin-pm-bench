9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and comprehensive, correctly identifying the overall non-compliance due to violations of Rules 2 and 3, while confirming satisfaction of Rules 1, 4, and 5. It aligns closely with the ground truth in content, reasoning, and citations, including precise event references and rule interpretations. Minor deductions for: (1) bulleted rather than strictly numbered justification format (prompt specifies "numbered"); (2) slight discrepancy in distance calculation for Rule 3 (LLM states "distance 4" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3," though both correctly conclude violation as >2); (3) unnecessary reference to timestamps in Rule 2 (order is event-based); and (4) incomplete listing of intervening activities in Rule 4 (LLM mentions only IDs 4 and 5, omitting 6, similar to ground truth's mention of only event 4). These are small structural and phrasing differences but warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria, preventing a perfect score.
