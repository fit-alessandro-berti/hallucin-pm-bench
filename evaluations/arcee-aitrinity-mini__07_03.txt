3.0

**Explanation (for transparency, not part of score):** Content identification is perfect (all added/removed tasks and gateway changes correct). However, under utmost strictness: 
- Tasks violate explicit format "id followed by the name in parentheses" — LLM uses "id: \"name\"" (colon + quotes, no parentheses) for all 4 task entries (-2.0 each, total -8.0 from 10).
- Missing "-" bullets on all 6 items as in ground truth (-0.5 each, total -3.0; overpenalized but capped).
- Extra quotes on names (-0.5).
- Minor spacing/alignment differences vs. ground truth.
Net: major format violations outweigh perfect content, yielding low score.
