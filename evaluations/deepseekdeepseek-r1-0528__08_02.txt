The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in content, structure, and the provided firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5), correctly demonstrating T5 firing before T3 using the P2 token directly. Both confirm the possibility without T3 occurring. Minor deductions for lacking formal marking notations (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}) and not explicitly noting T3's subsequent disablement, which adds precision in the ground truth; however, the explanation remains valid and concise (under 120 words).
