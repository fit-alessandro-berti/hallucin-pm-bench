**Score: 9.0**

**Evaluation:**

The LLM answer is essentially correct. It clearly answers "yes" to Q1 (matching ground truth) and explicitly provides a firing sequence for Q2: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. This is the same as the ground truth both in sequence and justification.

**Minor flaws leading to point deduction:**
- The LLM answer says "T5 then fires with P2 and P5, before T3 has fired (T3 remains unfired)." While this is accurate, it could be *slightly* more explicit that after T5 has fired, T3 is now disabled (matching the clarity of the ground truth), but this is a very minor issue.
- The marking after each step is not written as explicitly as in the ground truth (e.g., M₁, M₂, etc.), making the explanation marginally less formal and traceable, though still correct.

**Conclusion:** The answer is correct and matches the ground truth in substance, with only slight loss of rigor/formalism—worth a 9.0.
