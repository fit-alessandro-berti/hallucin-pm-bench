**Rationale:**  
The LLM answer is substantially correct in recognizing that T5 can fire before T3, and it provides a correct and minimal sequence up to the firing of T5: ⟨T1, T2b, T4, T5⟩. It even correctly analyzes the reasoning for minimality, and clearly explains that T3 has not (and cannot) have fired before T5 when taking this route via the shortcut T2b.

**However,** the LLM answer does not *explicitly* address continuing the sequence to actually fire T3 after T5, which is required by the prompt (since a correct "yes" answer must show that T3 can occur after T5 in the same run). The ground truth gives a full sequence: ⟨T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3⟩, explicitly showing that after T5 fires, the feedback loop can enable T3 to fire next, which is essential for a rigorous answer.

**Summary of mistakes:**  
- The LLM does not give a complete sequence where T5 occurs before T3 and T3 still can fire.
- The LLM does not mention firing of T6 and T3 after T5, nor does it state that after T5, the net enables T3 (as the ground truth does).
- Some of the proof language is good, but the answer lacks the formal thoroughness and explicit marking sequence beyond T5 present in the ground truth.

**Hence, significant points must be deducted (~3/10):** It's a strong, but incomplete, technical answer. Had it included the complete sequence showing T3 after T5, it would score very high.
