9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment, ~92% match)**: Both responses correctly and clearly state the value **cannot be derived/computed** due to missing timestamps/durations/elapsed times, fully complying with the system instruction. LLM accurately describes the data limitations (case_id, activity, resource only; timestamps redacted), mirroring ground truth's emphasis on lacking temporal values. LLM addresses both prompt parts (1: no value; 2: explanation).
- **Minor differences (deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Wording variances ("cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; "cycle time" vs. "cycle-time"; no mention of "ordering information" or "fabricated" risk).
  - LLM adds accurate hypothetical calculation (sum durations / 4 instances), which is helpful/pedagogical but exceeds ground truth's concise "no temporal value per event" reasoning—unnecessary under strict "answer only if supported" rule, introducing ~5-8% extraneous content.
  - No factual errors (4 instances correctly counted), but extra detail deviates from ground truth's brevity.
- **Overall**: Near-perfect under strict criteria; extra hypothetical is a small but notable deviation warranting deduction from 10.0.
