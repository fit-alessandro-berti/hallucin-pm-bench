The LLM answer is factually perfect, correctly identifying both counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order) with precise citations, timestamps for added verification, and adherence to "No" followed by one-paragraph justification. Minor deductions for stylistic differences from ground truth: no bullet formatting or concluding proof sentence, "inaccurate" vs. "false," "Line" capitalized vs. "line," "preceding...in the provided fragment" vs. "never contains at all" (both accurate but not identical phrasing), and lack of bolding on "No." These small presentational variances warrant a strict but minimal point loss under utmost scrutiny.
