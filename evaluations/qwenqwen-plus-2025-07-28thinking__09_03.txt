The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A (no rows or timestamps for cycle time calculation) and the irrelevance of Artefact B's high-level metrics. It precisely explains the lack of granular data for "Approve Invoice" durations without guessing or using external knowledge, covering all required elements (average, SD, CI) in one short paragraph as instructed. Minor deductions for slight verbosity in elaborating Artefact B's content (e.g., specific example of historical duration) and phrasing differences (e.g., "derive durations" vs. "concrete times"), which add unnecessary detail but do not introduce errors.
