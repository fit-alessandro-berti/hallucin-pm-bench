The LLM answer is clear, rigorous, and accurate. It states unequivocally that computation is impossible and directly justifies why: the event log has no rows or timestamps—only headers. It further specifies that without timestamp data for "Approve Invoice," no cycle times or statistics can be computed, and notes that the SLA catalogue does not help since it offers only high-level information. The answer does not try to guess or fill gaps unjustifiably and avoids introducing outside information.

Minor deductions (0.5) for slightly excessive wording in the explanation—phrases like “no computational approximation is possible” and “legally restricted, non-existent data” may be a little verbose compared to the very concise, sharply targeted ground truth ("Impossible — the necessary data are absent."). The ideal response could be a touch more concise.

Overall, the answer is very close to the ground truth in accuracy and content, with only minor stylistic differences.
