5.0

The LLM answer correctly concludes "No" and identifies counterexamples in C002 and C004, aligning with the ground truth's overall assessment that the FACT is inaccurate due to violations. However, it contains a significant factual error in the analysis of C001: the sequence is accurately listed as Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items (immediate succession), but the justification incorrectly claims Pack_Items intervenes between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, wrongly categorizing C001 as a violation. This misrepresents the evidence and deviates substantially from the ground truth's accurate case-by-case breakdown (e.g., the table correctly marks C001 as compliant). Additionally, the C003 sequence omits Pack_Items (though irrelevant here) and uses a less structured narrative format instead of the ground truth's clear tabular presentation. Under strict evaluation, these errors in justification—especially the core misinterpretation of a key case—warrant a substantial deduction from a perfect score.
