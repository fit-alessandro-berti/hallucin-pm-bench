The LLM answer fails catastrophically on part 1 by incorrectly stating 3 occurrences of "Manual Fraud Check" (actual: 1, only in case 1002). This factual error invalidates the entire response. Part 2 provides a vague, generic explanation of sampling bias but ignores key ground truth elements: the exact single occurrence, tiny sample size (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), frequency volatility (0% to 7% swing), wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events, and confusion from near-synonyms like "Automatic Fraud Check" or "Fraud Check (Automatic)" via strict/fuzzy matching. The response exceeds utility and introduces misinformation, warranting the minimum score under strict criteria.
