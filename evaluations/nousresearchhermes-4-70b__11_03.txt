6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Credit Assessment, Legal Approval, Risk Review) as the ground truth, accurately quantifies SLA breaches (+60s, +300s, +300s) and mentions corresponding waiting times (200s, 600s, 480s), grounding these in the table data without invention. These core analytical elements align closely, supporting a moderate baseline score. The use of bullet points for recommendations matches the prompt and ground truth format.

However, significant deductions apply under strict criteria for the following differences and errors:
- **Structure and Format (major deviation, -1.5 points)**: Includes unnecessary elements like "Date: [Current Date]" and "see table below" (no table provided, violating "return only the memo text"). Header phrasing differs (e.g., "COO, Orion Credit" vs. "Chief Operating Officer"; "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office"). Ground truth uses bolding for activities and throughput emphasis, absent here.
- **Content and Wording (moderate deviations, -1.0 point)**: Order of activities differs (Credit first vs. Legal first), altering emphasis. Introduces invented total cases implicitly via "performance review" without the ground truth's (flawed) "4 805 completed cases." Opening and bottleneck description phrasing diverges substantially (e.g., "flags three activities requiring urgent attention" vs. "highlights three activities that materially breach...").
- **Recommendations (major differences, -1.0 point)**: Entirely distinct actions, none matching the ground truth (e.g., LLM's "automated scoring triggers by 15%" vs. ground's "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"; quantifies inventions like "15%," "2 additional officers," "200[s]," "5 staff," "180[s]"—violating "data-driven" and "no inventing metrics," more egregiously than ground truth's unquantified suggestions). Adds polite closing ("Please let me know...") absent in ground truth.
- **Length and Fidelity (minor, -0.5 point)**: ≈180 words vs. ground truth's ≈140, exceeding ≈150 slightly; lacks ground truth's end-to-end projection (35% reduction) while adding unrelated offer for analysis.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Even though both violate the "no inventing" rule in recommendations, the LLM's added fabricated metrics (e.g., percentages, staff numbers) amplify differences from ground truth, warranting harsher penalty for non-alignment.

Overall, strong match on identification/quantification (70% alignment) but weak on execution (recommendations, format), yielding 6.5. Lower scores would apply if inventions were weighted more, but core prompt fulfillment provides uplift.
