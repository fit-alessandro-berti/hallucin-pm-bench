**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**:
  - Correctly identifies the 3 core decision points (eligibility in Triage, approval in Finance, amount-based branch), matching GT's count and essence.
  - Documents list is **complete and accurate**: All 7 items listed identically (including conditional *AuditTrail* note), no extras introduced. Matches GT perfectly here (+3.0 points).
  
- **Major deductions (strict penalties for differences)**:
  - **Missing explicit branching logic/outcomes** (-1.5): GT details full branches (e.g., "*Not eligible* → rejected/returned"; "*Rejected* → process ends"). LLM only implies (e.g., "determines whether eligible"; "decides whether to sign off") without stating reject paths or endings. Critical for "every decision point" summary.
  - **Imprecise decision framing** (-0.8): GT #3 combines "*Final payment approval* at **Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review**" with approve/reject. LLM splits Finance as separate "sign off" decision, then branch "after pre-approval"—accurate per process but misaligns with GT's consolidated view and constraint ("after ... has succeeded **and** ...").
  - **Structure/format mismatch** (-0.5): GT uses precise table for decisions (#, point, logic/outcomes) + numbered doc list. LLM uses informal bullets/narrative—no table, less scannable/structured.
  - **Minor phrasing/omissions** (-0.3 each, total -0.6): No "≤ €1 000" explicit (says "lower-value"); no GT's closing note on "no legacy activities"; "few key decisions" vs. GT's exhaustive "every"; "documents and artefacts" ok but GT sticks to "documents".
  - No violations of "do not introduce" rule (+0).

- **Overall**: Strong content match (~80% alignment) but strict loss for incompleteness in logic/outcomes (core to prompt), structure, and precision. Not a "copy" of GT; differences compound under "utmost strictness."
