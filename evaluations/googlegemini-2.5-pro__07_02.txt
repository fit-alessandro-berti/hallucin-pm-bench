9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and summarizes all required changes under the exact headings, matching the ground truth in content accuracy (e.g., all added/removed tasks and the gateway change are precisely captured, ignoring cosmetics like name renamings). No extraneous changes are mentioned, aligning with the prompt's constraints.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Minor wording differences** (significant deduction per instructions): The gateway change lacks the semantic clarifications "(XOR)" and "(OR)" from the ground truth, and omits explicit versioning ("in *v1* to ... in *v2*"), reducing precision (-0.4 points).
- **Formatting inconsistencies** (small errors warranting loss): Lists use bullets and backticks inconsistently with ground truth's numbered lists, bolding, and name-first/ID-second order (e.g., removed tasks reverse the presentation order), making it not an exact match (-0.3 points).
- **Omission of meta-note**: Ground truth includes a closing note on completeness, which the LLM subtly implies but does not state, a minor structural gap (-0.1 points).

Total deductions from 10.0: -0.8 points. The answer is highly effective but not identical, justifying a strong but not perfect score.
