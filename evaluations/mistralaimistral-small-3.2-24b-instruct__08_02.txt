**Score: 8.0**

**Rationale:**

- The LLM answer gives the correct response: "Yes" for Q1, and for Q2, it lists the correct minimal firing sequence ([T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]).
- The explanation for Q1 is mostly correct ("T5 can fire before T3..."), and the answer walks through the creation of P5 and availability of the token in P2.
- The sequence order in Q2 is accurate, no extra steps included.
- However, the wording in Q1 makes a small misstep: "Meanwhile, P2 remains unprocessed." is a little vague, as is "bypassing T3 entirely. T3 is unnecessary for T5 to fire." It's better to say that firing T5 disables T3, which is clarified in the ground truth but not in the LLM answer.
- The LLM answer could have more explicitly stated *why* T3 becomes disabled after T5 fires, per the ground truth.
- There is a minor deficit in preciseness and depth of explanation about the disabling of T3â€”important for utmost strictness.

**Summary:** The answer is essentially correct and contains no major mistakes, but a lack of precision and a missing explicit explanation about T3's disabling loses it 2 points.
