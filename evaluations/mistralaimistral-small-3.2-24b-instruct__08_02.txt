The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" for Q1 and provides the same minimal firing sequence as the ground truth for Q2, accurately demonstrating T5 firing before T3 via the alternative path. However, it loses points for strict adherence: lacks intermediate markings (M1-M5) shown in ground truth, omits the key detail that T5 consumes the P2 token and disables T3 afterward (which confirms irrecoverable precedence), and uses a less precise phrasing ("bypassing T3 entirely" vs. ground truth's explicit execution trace). Minor formatting differences (e.g., "Answer 1" vs. "Q1") and brevity reduce completeness, but no factual errors.
