The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4. However, Q5 is substantially incorrect: it identifies only one correct activity ("Validate_Order") out of three, incorrectly includes "Receive_Order" (which appears as the first event in two cases), and omits the two other activities that never start a case ("Pack_Items" and "Ship_Order"). This represents a critical error in analysis of case starting events, warranting a significant deduction despite the perfect performance on the other questions.
