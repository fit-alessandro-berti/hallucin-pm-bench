6.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, all of which are entirely correct. However, Q5 contains two mistakes: it wrongly lists "Receive_Order" as never first (it is a first event in two cases!) and omits "Pack_Items" and "Ship_Order", which should be included as never first. "Validate_Order" is correct in Q5.

Given this, the LLM earns full points on four questions (out of five), but the Q5 error is substantial (misreads the event-log for start events and misclassifies the main activity), so a strict standard demands a strong penalty.

- Q1: ✅
- Q2: ✅
- Q3: ✅
- Q4: ✅
- Q5: ❌ (2 errors: inclusion of a wrong activity, omission of two correct ones; only "Validate_Order" is correct)

Thus, a score of 6.0 reflects that Q5 (worth 20%) is mostly wrong, despite the rest being perfect.
