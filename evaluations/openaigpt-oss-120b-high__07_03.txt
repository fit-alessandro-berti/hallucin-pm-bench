The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact IDs, names, and gateway type transitions matching the ground truth. However, it introduces minor formatting deviations: headings are bolded (not verbatim plain text as required), lists lack the bullet points used in the ground truth, and the second gateway entry omits alignment spaces. These small inconsistencies warrant a deduction despite the core content being flawless.
