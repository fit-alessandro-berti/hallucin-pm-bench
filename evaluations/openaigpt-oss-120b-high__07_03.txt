7.5

Explanation:  
- The LLM answer contains all the correct items for each section; there are no omissions or additions regarding changed elements.  
- However, it omits the leading dash "-" in each list item, which is required by the ground truth ("- Task_FraudCheck..." etc.).  
- It provides the correct IDs, names, and format for gateway transitions, but misses the indentation and alignment used in the ground truth for GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES (the "     " space in "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel").  
- All headings are present and in correct order, but the LLM answer bolds the headings, which is an unnecessary formatting deviation.  
- Therefore, while factually complete, the formatting differences (missing dashes, lack of indentation, added bold) require a significant penalty per the strict instructions.
