**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (supporting high base score)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), prioritized logically by dominant metrics (wait/rework/SLA/proc time). Explanations are strictly table-based without hallucinations or absent activities. Actions are concrete and plausibly data-driven (e.g., targeting high rework/wait). Memo format is executive-appropriate, concise (~170 words <200 limit), and structured (why + action per item).
- **Penalties (significant deductions for differences/small errors)**:
  - **Missed key metrics in "why" explanations (-1.0)**: Omits throughput drop (190 cases/day) for Request_Documents (GT highlights as "balloons"); ignores 30-min wait for Review_Documents (GT's second-worst wait, critical bottleneck driver); downplays 12-min processing for Initial_Assessment.
  - **Interpretive language over strict data (-0.4)**: Adds unsubstantiated claims like "causing major upstream delays," "resource capacity shortage," vs. GT's neutral, metric-focused phrasing.
  - **Action divergences (-0.2)**: All three recommendations differ (e.g., portal validation vs. digital requests; OCR vs. AI classification + squad; staff reallocation vs. triage engine). GT's are more precisely tied to multiple metrics (e.g., "halve rework"); LLM's reallocation mentions Check_Coverage (table-ok but unnecessary/other-activity reference).
  - **Missing elements (-0.1)**: No closing impact projection (GT's ≈10% throughput lift, >40% SLA reduction); less metric bolding/emphasis for scannability.
  - **Minor format/style (-0.1)**: "MEMORANDUM" header vs. GT's "Executive Memo"; subject line added (unrequired).

Overall: High fidelity (same picks, no violations) but non-verbatim metric coverage, phrasing, and actions prevent 10.0. Strict rubric demands near-exact alignment.
