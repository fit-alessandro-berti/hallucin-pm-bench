7.5

**Justification:**

- **A1**: The LLM provides the correct number of distinct cases (**3**), listing their case IDs (C001, C002, C003) explicitly. However, the answer is unnecessarily verbose instead of simply returning "3" as specified in the ground truth.

- **A2**: The sequence for case C002 is correct ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"), properly ordered. However, the answer includes explanatory text and phrasing that is not required, and it does not exactly match the required succinct format.

- **A3**: The LLM correctly identifies and alphabetises the two distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"). It does, however, include extraneous explanatory information and answer formatting (bullets, explanations), and does not use the required markdown or a dash before each item as shown in the ground truth.

**Point Deductions (strictness):**
- **A1**: -0.5 for unnecessary enumeration/explanation.
- **A2**: -0.5 for verbose explanation and not being succinct.
- **A3**: -1.5 for including explanations/trace-by-trace walkthrough and using bullet points instead of the precise format ("- Arrange_Delivery", "- Check_Stock") required.

**Summary:**  
All factual answers are accurate, but the format has multiple deviations from the concise, precise style demanded by the ground truth. These stylistic/formatting issues and surplus explanations merit a non-trivial loss of points, but the facts are entirely correct. Thus, 7.5/10.
