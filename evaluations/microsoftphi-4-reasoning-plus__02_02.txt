The LLM answer is factually correct on all questions, with Q1 matching the core number (3) despite extra descriptive text; Q2 exactly matching the sequence; and Q3 correctly identifying and alphabetizing the distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") on separate lines. Minor deductions for verbose reasoning, extra per-case breakdowns in Q3 (not in ground truth), and slight format variations (e.g., no dashes/bullets, plain lines instead of "<br>" structure), which introduce unnecessary content under strict criteria, but no hallucinations or factual errors.
