The LLM answer is semantically perfect, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with exact IDs, names, and format «id: old → new». No extras, no omissions, no commentary.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Added "### " prefix to all three headings (not verbatim as required; ground truth uses plain text headings).
- Missing alignment spaces in GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES second line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" vs. LLM's "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel").

These are small but verifiable formatting deviations from the ground truth, warranting a significant deduction (1.0 point total).
