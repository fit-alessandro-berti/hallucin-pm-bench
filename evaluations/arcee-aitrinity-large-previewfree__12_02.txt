The LLM answer is factually correct, accurately identifies both counterexamples (C003 and C005), and justifies in one concise paragraph using case-IDs and precise timestamps (equivalent to line citations for ordering). However, strict evaluation deducts for: (1) not citing line numbers explicitly (uses times instead, minor deviation from ground truth style); (2) minor extraneous detail on C005 ("followed immediately by Cancel_Order"); (3) plain "No." formatting vs. bolded "**No**"; (4) single-paragraph structure without bullet points matching ground truth layout; (5) slightly different phrasing (e.g., "violate the claim" vs. "prove that ... does **not always** follow"). These small differences warrant a significant but not drastic deduction from perfection.
