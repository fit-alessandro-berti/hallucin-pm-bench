**7.1**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), matching ground truth. Explanations cite table data accurately (e.g., wait times, processing times, rework, SLA breaches). Provides one recommendation per activity. Concise (~180 words), no hallucinations or absent activities. No guessing on differentiation.
- **Major Deductions (-2.9 total)**:
  - **Misses key metrics**: Ignores throughput drops (e.g., 280→190 at Request_Documents, central to ground truth's "balloons" and "bottlenecks"). Ground truth emphasizes this for "hotspots"; omission weakens "why" analysis (-1.0).
  - **Inaccurate emphasis**: For Request_Documents, highlights "variability in processing time (1 minute)" as a contributor—stdev=1 is *low* (not a problem), misaligning with data/ground truth (-0.8).
  - **Weaker explanations**: Initial_Assessment lacks upstream "feeding congestion" context; generic intro summary doesn't "isolate hotspots" like ground truth (-0.5).
  - **Inferior recommendations**: Less concrete/data-driven (e.g., "automated system" vs. ground truth's "same-day digital... halve rework"; no metrics like "trim processing time," "cut queueing") (-0.6).
- **Minor Deductions (-0.5 total)**: Letter format/signature unnecessary (ground truth is stark memo); no projection/impact summary (e.g., "+10% throughput"); less punchy phrasing.
- **Overall**: Faithful but lacks precision, metric completeness, and actionable depth—clear differences justify sub-8.0 under utmost strictness.
