The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1 (claims "No" instead of "Yes"), failing to recognize the alternative path to P4 via T2â†’T7 that preserves the P2 token for T5 without firing T3. Its Q2 explanation is flawed and irrelevant, providing no valid sequence and contradicting the ground truth. This constitutes a complete misunderstanding of the Petri net dynamics, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
