**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (basis for high base score)**: Correctly identifies exactly the 3 decision points matching ground truth (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval). Logic/conditions equivalent (e.g., >2 vs. ≤2 phrasing is mathematically identical). Required documents list is **complete and verbatim from prompt** (superior to GT's abbreviations like omitting "old", "single or", "template").
- **Errors/Differences (significant deductions per strict criteria)**:
  1. **Missing context/positions (-0.8)**: GT specifies "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"; LLM omits, reducing precision.
  2. **Phrasing variances (-0.5)**: Alignment Gate ">2" vs. GT's "≤2 ⇒ continue; else"; Amount "proceed to step 8" vs. "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval"; MBA "approve or reject" (lowercase, "to") vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**" (exact caps/bold).
  3. **Formatting/structure (-0.3)**: "###" + "(Activities with Choices)" (unnecessary interpretive addition) vs. GT's "####"; bullets (▪) vs. numbered list.
  4. **Docs section (-0.1)**: "at Submission" extra; no "(complete list)"; lacks GT's disclaiming note (though not required by prompt).
  5. **Minor omissions (-0.1)**: No italics/bold/emphasis matching GT style.
- **Overall**: ~85% match (content faithful, but lacks GT's descriptive depth/formatting fidelity). Strictness applied: small phrasing/context gaps deduct ~1.8 total from 10.0.
