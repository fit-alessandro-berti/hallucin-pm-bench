The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in substance, structure, and adherence to the system instructions: it correctly refuses to provide a derivable value, states the impossibility clearly for question 1, and provides a concise, accurate explanation for question 2 based on the redacted temporal data. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed"; no explicit mention of "ordering information" or "fabricated" answers) and less emphasis on the complete absence of any temporal data beyond redaction, but these are negligible semantic variations without impacting correctness.
