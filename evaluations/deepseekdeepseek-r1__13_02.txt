The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match precisely (2.08% and 8.33%, with correct calculations). For Question 3, the response (78 words) adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, explicitly references the single occurrence via counts (1/48 events, 1/12 cases), notes instability/variance through "statistically insignificant" impact, potential skewing of metrics like averages, and model oversight leading to unreliability, and cautions against over-generalization by highlighting risks in performance analyses, predictions, simulations, and decisions. No inventions, errors, or omissions relative to the data or ground truth criteria.
