- Q1: Correctly states "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time. (Perfect.)
- Q2a: Correct percentage of events (2.08%) and correct calculation shown. (Perfect.)
- Q2b: Correct percentage of cases (8.33%) and calculation. (Perfect.)
- Q3: Satisfies (i) (mentions “1/48 events, 1/12 cases”), (ii) (describes statistical insignificance and impact on metrics/models), and (iii) (warns about generalization/misleading findings).

**Minor deduction (−0.5):**  
- The rationale in (3) is sound but could be slightly improved by more explicitly referencing variance/instability (e.g., “statistically insignificant” ≈ low support, but does not precisely mention variance or that a single observation makes results unstable). The mention of “skew performance metrics” is close but not maximally explicit regarding statistical variability.
  
Otherwise, this answer is entirely aligned with the ground truth and all numeric results are exactly correct.
