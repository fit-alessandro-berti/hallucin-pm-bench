9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and essentially matches the ground truth in both content and in the identification of concurrent task sets, their order, and membership. Both answers correctly identify the two parallel blocks and the tasks involved in each, and do not introduce any extraneous or missing information about Process B.

Very minor deductions apply due to small differences in expression:
- The LLM answer repeats the structure of referencing "Parallel Split #1 to Merge #1" and "Parallel Split #2 to Merge #2", which is clear, but is not exactly the same wording as "first parallel block" and "second parallel block." The ground truth uses slightly more concise labels.
- The ground truth includes the explicit statement: "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." The LLM answer omits this, which is a slight lack of explicit completeness.

Overall, the differences are extremely minor, reflecting mainly stylistic or completeness preferences, thus the answer merits a 9.5.
