The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets with accurate task names and ordering, fully aligning with the core content of the ground truth. However, it incurs minor deductions for format deviations (e.g., bullet lists and split/merge labels instead of inline `task` â€– `task` notation and "parallel block" phrasing) and an unnecessary introductory sentence, plus omission of the explicit completeness statement ("No other tasks..."), which slightly reduces fidelity under strict evaluation.
