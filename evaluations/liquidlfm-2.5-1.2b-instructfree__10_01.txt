The LLM answer fails catastrophically on all criteria with utmost strictness applied:

- **Format**: Not a RACI matrix (no table, no rows/columns structure, no comprehensive R/A/C/I per activity/role). Uses invalid XML-like tags instead of a proper matrix.
- **Vocabulary**: Violates STRICT policy by using all three forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing"). Zero mandated synonyms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance").
- **Correctness**: Incomplete RACI (only "RESPONSIBLE" shown, no A/C/I). Mismatches (e.g., "Order Validation" wrongly under "Finance Clerk"; ignores process narrative). No single Responsible per activity with proper Accountable allocations.
- **Unwarranted content**: Introduces malformed, redundant role-activity pairings without matrix logic.
- No adherence to prompt's core request. Equivalent to non-response.
