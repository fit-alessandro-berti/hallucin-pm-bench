**4.0**

The LLM answer proposes the correct high-level solution (interrupting boundary timer event with PT48H duration and sequence flow to Task_Triage) but has critical differences from the ground truth: wrong attachment point (Task_RequestDocs vs. Task_Receive), missing new event ID (Timer_48h), incorrect BPMN semantics ("relative to Start_Claim" – boundary timers trigger from activity start, not process start), no XML snippet for timeDuration, and assumes implicit waiting in RequestDocs (process flows directly to Triage). These are major functional/spec errors, failing strict SLA enforcement fidelity; minor similarities in structure/explanation prevent lower score.
