8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Compliance Conclusion**: Matches ground truth perfectly ("Non-compliant").
- **Justification for Violations**:
  - Rule 2: Accurate identification and explanation of the sequence violation (`Risk_Assessment` after `Ship_Goods`). No differences.
  - Rule 3: Correctly identifies violation and cites the relevant events. However, minor error in distance calculation/phrasing ("4 activities after" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"), which is a small inaccuracy in precision but does not change the correctness of the violation assessment. Under strictness, this warrants a deduction.
- **Completeness**: Significant differenceâ€”LLM only addresses the two violated rules, omitting analysis of Rules 1, 4, and 5 (all satisfied per ground truth). Ground truth provides a full, numbered audit of all rules for thoroughness, making the LLM response incomplete relative to the expected comprehensive justification.
- **Format and Structure**: LLM follows the required format (Non-compliant + numbered justifications citing rules) but lacks the ground truth's detailed satisfaction explanations and summary conclusion. This contributes to differences without adding errors.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Core violations are handled well (+ high marks), but incompleteness (missing rule checks) and small distance error lead to notable point loss (from a potential 10.0 to 8.0). No major factual errors or hallucinations.
