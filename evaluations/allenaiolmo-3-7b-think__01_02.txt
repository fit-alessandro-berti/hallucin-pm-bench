8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and lists all six required documents without omissions or additions. Descriptions are accurate to the process flow and use exact activity names. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Decision points deductions (-1.5 total)**: 
  - Misses precise flow context ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for #1; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for #2), altering summary completeness.
  - #1: "resolution" deviates from ground truth/original "tie-break"; fuller underwriter names unnecessary vs. ground truth phrasing.
  - #3: Extra "the loan, ending the process"; lowercase "approve or reject" vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**".
  
- **Required documents deductions (-0.5 total)**: Minor phrasing variances exactly matching source but differing from ground truth ("≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"). Bulleted unnumbered list vs. numbered; lacks "(complete list)" and explanatory note.

High fidelity overall (no factual errors, no extraneous terminology), but contextual/verbatim diffs warrant deduction from 10.0.
