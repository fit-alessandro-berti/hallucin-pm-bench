9.0

**Evaluation:**

**Q1:** Correct—"Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time.  
**Q2:** Correct—5.56% is the proper computation ($1 ÷ 18 × 100$).  
**Q3:** Correct—A1002 is the only case containing "Manual_Fraud_Check."  
**Q4:** The first reason, about small sample size, is completely accurate and well-expressed. The second point, however, states: "the fragment covers only a single day's worth of activities," but *the ground truth only permits us to say it covers a short time window* (we don't know if it is really only a single day; maybe it’s even less). The ground truth also highlights that only the morning of 2025-05-01 is present; claiming "a single day" is a slight inference.

**Strictness per instruction:**  
- While the answer does not hallucinate data, the wording in Q4's second reason slightly oversteps by asserting "covers only a single day's worth of activities" instead of "covers only the morning of 1 May 2025," or more rigorously, "covers only a short interval."  
- No other issues are present. Every computation and reference to the log is accurate and justified.

**Deduction:**  
- 1.0 point deducted for the slight but meaningful overstatement regarding the covered time period in Q4, per the demand for utmost strictness.

**Final score:**  
**9.0**
