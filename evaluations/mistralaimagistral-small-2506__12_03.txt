### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of Answer**: The LLM correctly answers "No," aligning with the ground truth. This is the core decision, earning baseline points.
- **Justification Strengths**: The LLM accurately identifies and cites C002 as a counterexample, detailing the sequence (Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment) and timestamps. It correctly notes that a single counterexample disproves the "always" claim, showing logical understanding.
- **Justification Weaknesses (Significant Deductions Due to Strict Criteria)**:
  - **Incompleteness**: The LLM omits C004 entirely, where another clear counterexample exists (Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment). This violates the task's requirement to cite "relevant CaseIDs" (implying all applicable ones) and rely "only on the evidence" in the full log. Ground truth comprehensively covers all four cases; missing one halves the thoroughness.
  - **Imprecise Language**: Stating "other cases (C001, C003) might follow" introduces unnecessary uncertainty ("might") and explicitly excludes C004 without verification, implying incomplete analysis. This is a small but notable error under strict evaluation, as it misrepresents the log's coverage.
  - **Lack of Structure and Depth**: No case-by-case breakdown or table like the ground truth, reducing clarity and completeness. While not required, the ground truth's format sets a high bar for meticulous justification; the LLM's is adequate but not exhaustive.
- **Overall Differences**: The LLM captures ~50-60% of the ground truth's analytical depth (one of two counterexamples, partial case mentions vs. full table). Logically sound but flawed in scope, warranting a mid-range score. No major factual errors, but omissions and imprecision deduct heavily per instructions.
