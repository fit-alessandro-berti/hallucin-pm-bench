4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the core task elements (identifying the same three activities—Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment—based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times; quantifying excesses correctly as +300s, +300s, +60s; using bullets only for recommendations; memo format ≈150 words; grounding most in table data like throughput/waiting times and cases) but incurs significant deductions for strict adherence to the prompt and alignment with ground truth:

- **Major errors/inventions (severe point loss, -3.0 total):** Invents non-table metric "249,125 aggregate seconds" for Credit Assessment waiting time (table provides only average 200s; aggregate is fabricated, violating "do NOT invent...metrics" and prompt's data-grounding rule). Recommendations include unsubstantiated phrases like "up to 3x," "1x," and "+6%" (not derivable from table; ground truth avoids such ungrounded multipliers). Adds unprompted/ungrounded claims like "cumulatively drive over half the total observed delay" (no total delay metric in table).

- **Factual inaccuracy (-1.0):** Misstates Credit Assessment waiting time as aggregate instead of average 200s (direct table value, matching ground truth's correct 200s).

- **Structural/alignment differences (-1.0):** Lacks subject line (ground truth has "Throughput Bottlenecks..."); introductory analysis omits total cases reference (ground truth specifies "4 805 completed cases," likely derived); recommendations are less concrete/data-tied (e.g., LLM's vague "increase capacity" vs. ground truth's specific "rule-based pre-checks" or "add one risk analyst"); no end projection (ground truth has "reduce...by roughly 35 %").

- **Minor issues (-0.5):** Header "memo" informal (ground truth formal); recommendations bold unsupported terms (e.g., **3x**); slight deviation in "From" phrasing (matches prompt but not ground truth's "Process Performance Office").

Overall, while 70% aligned on key content, inventions and deviations erode fidelity, justifying a mid-low score under utmost strictness.
