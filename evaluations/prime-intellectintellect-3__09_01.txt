The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in core conclusion (cannot compute/derive), structure (numbered 1-2 matching prompt), and key reasoning (log lacks timestamps/durations/timing data; only case/activity/resource present). Minor deductions (-0.2) for: (1) not explicitly mentioning "ordering information" or "fabricated numeric answer" (small omissions per strict criteria); (2) adding benchmark disclaimer (accurate but extraneous to ground truth focus). No factual errors or fabrications.
