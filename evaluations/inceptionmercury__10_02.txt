3.0

**Evaluation:**

- **Roles:** The LLM correctly replaced "Payment Clerk" with "Transaction Analyst" and "Compliance Officer" with "Regulatory Liaison" per the enforced vocabulary. However, it missed the role of **Operations Manager**, which is present in the ground truth.
- **Tasks:** The LLM stuck closely to the informal task breakdown, but often used less formal/correct naming (e.g., “Perform KYC Review” instead of just “KYC Review”, “Approve high-risk transaction” instead of “Approve High-Risk Transactions”, “Ensure the SWIFT message is sent” instead of mapping this to an accepted mandated wording or grouping per ground truth like "Release Payment").
- **RACI Assignments:** There are significant discrepancies:
    - The LLM used different Responsible and Accountable assignments than the ground truth. For example, in the ground truth, for “Screen Against Sanctions List”, the **Responsible** is "Transaction Analyst" and **Accountable** is "Regulatory Liaison". The LLM puts both as "Transaction Analyst".
    - The "KYC Review" is marked Responsible/Accountable as Transaction Analyst in the LLM, which is incorrect; it should be Regulatory Liaison and Operations Manager, respectively.
    - “Approve high-risk transaction” incorrectly makes Regulatory Liaison both R and A and adds Transaction Analyst as Consulted, which is not present in the ground truth.
    - "Archive the case file" leaves out Transaction Analyst and does not mark IT Support as Responsible per ground truth ("Archive Record").
- **Columns:** The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role column entirely, present in the ground truth.
- **Task/Activity Wording:** The LLM does NOT strictly follow the mandated/ground truth activity column wording throughout (e.g., “Perform KYC Review” vs. "KYC Review"; “Release the payment” vs. "Release Payment").
- **Formatting:** The markdown table is technically present, but it does not include a legend, making interpretation less clear.
- **Omissions:** The legend is not provided, and there is no mapping/note referencing the explicit RACI role assignments as in the ground truth.

**Strictness Results:** Multiple moderate to major divergences in roles, activity naming, structure, RACI attributions, and completeness. All contribute to a very significant point loss. The only thing fully correct is the avoidance of banned vocabulary.

**Final Strict Score: 3.0**
