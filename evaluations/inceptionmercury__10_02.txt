The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, task granularity, role assignments, and introduction of unsupported elements, warranting a severe deduction under strict evaluation criteria. Key issues include: inverted RACI format (role names under R/A/C/I columns instead of roles as columns with RACI letters); incorrect RACI mappings (e.g., KYC Review assigned to Transaction Analyst as R/A instead of Regulatory Liaison as R with Operations Manager as A); addition of an extraneous task ("Ensure the SWIFT message is sent") not present in the ground truth; omission of the Operations Manager role entirely, which is central to accountability in the ground truth; verbose task phrasing mismatched to the ground truth's concise, mandated-style wording; and failure to include the legend or explanatory note format of the ground truth. While mandated vocabulary is partially applied, these core discrepancies in process logic and table fidelity result in minimal alignment.
