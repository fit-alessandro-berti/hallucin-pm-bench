- **1.** The LLM answer correctly states "3" (distinct cases), which matches the ground truth, though the ground truth lists the case names—minor omission.
- **2.** "Pack_Items" is correctly given as the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" for C456.
- **3.** "Cancel_Order" is also correct as the only activity to appear exactly once.

The only (very minor) deviation is that the LLM answer does not enumerate the actual case IDs for Q1, as the ground truth does—informing this small deduction (per strictness). Otherwise, the content is correct, concise, and in bullet format.
