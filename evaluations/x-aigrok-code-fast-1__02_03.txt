9.0  
- The LLM answer is highly accurate and matches the ground truth in content for all questions.  
- Minor deduction for A1: LLM provides only the number "3" (correct per prompt), while ground truth includes the explicit case list "(C123, C456, C789)" as elaborationâ€”slight format mismatch under strict evaluation.  
- A2 and A3 are identical in substance, with negligible formatting difference (backslash escape in ground truth).
