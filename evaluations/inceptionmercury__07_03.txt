The LLM answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks as well as the gateway type changes. However, it formats the headings with a leading hyphen and trailing double space, and presents the list entries in a Markdown style with an extraneous hyphen (e.g., "- Task_FraudCheck") instead of the required format (without hyphenation, as in the ground truth). It also introduces unnecessary whitespace in the gateway change row (double space before the change details).

While these are minor formatting errors, the instruction demands utmost strictness and verbatim adherence to the given headings and formatting. Thus, the answer, while functionally complete, deserves a significant penalty for not matching the required output style exactly.
