The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway type changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with proper ID-name formatting for tasks and "old → new" notation for gateways. No extraneous commentary or unchanged elements are mentioned, adhering to the prompt's restrictions.

However, under strict evaluation, minor formatting discrepancies result in point deductions: (1) Headings are prefixed with "-" (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS"), which the ground truth omits, treating them as plain headings rather than list items; this deviates from the ground truth's verbatim structure. (2) Sub-bullets under headings are indented with two spaces plus "-", while the ground truth uses a single "- " without additional indentation. (3) In GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, the second entry lacks the exact spacing alignment after the colon (ground truth has extra spaces for visual alignment: "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"), making the outputs non-identical as strings. These small but verifiable differences, per the evaluation criteria, warrant a deduction of 0.8 points from a perfect score.
