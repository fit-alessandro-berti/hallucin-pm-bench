7.0

- The LLM answer uses only the allowed vocabulary (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”), which is correct.
- The table is clearly laid out with activities as rows and roles as columns.

Main issues leading to point deductions:

**1. RACI assignment problems:**
  - The LLM answer only ever marks R and A for each activity (e.g., “R, A”), assigning no Cs or Is at all, which is much less granular and less informative than the ground truth, where each role has one of R (Responsible), A (Accountable), C (Consulted), or I (Informed) for each row.
  - In particular, key distinctions like Account Manager being “R / A” vs Compliance Officer being Consulted or Informed on many activities, etc., are missing.
  - For “KYC Review”, only the Compliance Officer is “R, A” in the LLM answer, but in the ground truth Answer, the CO is only R (“A” is with AM), and other roles are marked as Consulted or Informed.
  - For “Order Vetting”, similarly the LLM marks only “R, A” for the AM, which ignores that other roles should be C or I.
  - This same collapsing of roles applies throughout; only one role per activity is marked as “R, A”.

**2. The structure of marking:**
  - The ground truth distinguishes between “R / A”, “R”, “A”, “C”, “I”, and this distinction reflects the actual handoffs and notifications in the workflow. The LLM answer flattens this (sometimes putting “R, A” for the same person, but not always). As a result, it glosses over cross-role interactions that are present in the underlying business process.

**3. Omitted information:**
  - Many C (Consulted) and I (Informed) assignments from the ground truth are omitted entirely.

**4. Formatting:**
  - The LLM answer provides a “RACI Key: R=Responsible, A=Accountable”, omitting explanations for C and I—which, as noted, are never used.
  - Also, the formatting is slightly less explicit (not bold, and uses “R, A” instead of “R / A” as shown in the ground truth).

**5. No forbidden terms used:**  
  - This is correct; no vocabulary violations.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer is correct in adhering to the vocabulary, but is incomplete and less accurate in assigning RACI roles compared to the ground truth; the lack of C and I assignments is a severe miss in faithful mapping. It remains readable and follows the instructions, but would not be usable for strict process-mapping or audit purposes.

**Final: 7.0** (loss of 3 points for significant incompleteness in the RACI role distribution and some minor formatting details)
