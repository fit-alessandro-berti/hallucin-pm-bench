7.0

The LLM answer identifies the correct pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel in Process B and returns both pairs. However, it loses significant points for the following mistakes:

- **Formatting**: The required output format is not followed. Each pair should be on its own line, separated by " — " (with two spaces before and after the em dash). The LLM answer uses only a single space on each side and does not align the pairs alphabetically in the global list.  
- **Strict Alphabetization**: The pairs are in alphabetical order internally, but the overall list does not follow the prescribed formatting with aligned tasks and proper dashes.
- **Instructions Compliance**: "Output one pair per line" is obeyed, but the precise format (`Task_X  —  Task_Y`) is not.

Given that the substance is correct but the format is notably wrong (and strictness is emphasized), a score of 7.0 reflects these formatting and instruction lapses.
