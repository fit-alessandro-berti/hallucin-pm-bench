The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring Process A as required), orders them alphabetically both within pairs (Create_Documentation before Quality_Check; Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines) and overall (C-pair before P-pair), and outputs one per line. However, it deviates from the ground truth in exact formatting: insufficient spacing around the em dash (one space vs. two as in the specified format `Task_X  —  Task_Y`), and lacks the padding spaces on the second line for visual alignment (e.g., "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines" in ground truth). Under utmost strictness, these small formatting errors warrant a deduction, though the content is otherwise identical to the ground truth.
