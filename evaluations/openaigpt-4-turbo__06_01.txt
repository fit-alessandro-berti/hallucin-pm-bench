9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs with proper intra-pair and inter-pair alphabetical ordering, using the specified format per line and ignoring Process A. Content and logic are perfect, matching the rationale. The sole differences are minor whitespace inconsistencies: lack of leading spaces on the second line for dash alignment (present in ground truth) and possible minor variations in trailing spaces. Under utmost strictness, this formatting discrepancy warrants a 1.0-point deduction from a perfect score.
