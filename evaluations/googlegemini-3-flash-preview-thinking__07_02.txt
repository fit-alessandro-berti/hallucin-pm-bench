**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core correctness (high marks)**: Identifies *exactly* the same changes as ground truth—no misses, no extras, no fabrications. Added: all 3 tasks precise (names/IDs). Removed: exact 1 task. Gateway: correct type shift (exclusive → inclusive), same ID.
- **Structure/Headings**: Matches exactly (3 headings, grouped properly). Minor formatting diff (bullets vs numbered; **bold** similar)—negligible deduct (-0.2).
- **Conciseness/Strictness violations (significant deducts)**:
  - Unnecessary intro sentence (+0.3 words deviation): -0.4
  - Extra descriptive phrases in Added tasks (positions ok, but "replaces... with new identifier and path" is *misleading interpretive error* blurring added/removed separation; contradicts strict listing): -0.8
  - Extra phrase in Removed (-0.2 words): -0.1
  - Extra explanatory clause in Gateway ("allowing... paths (e.g...)"): unrequested analysis -0.3
- **Precision nits**: Gateway phrasing "Exclusive Gateway (`exclusiveGateway`)" vs ground truth "exclusive (XOR)" slightly less semantic (-0.1). No "(No other...)" completeness note (-0.0, optional).
- **Total**: Perfect content = 10 base; -1.8 for extras/mislead = 8.2. Strict but not punitive for embellishment alone, as changes are unflawed.
