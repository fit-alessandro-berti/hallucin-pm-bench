**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate, concise, and strictly data-driven, matching the ground truth in verdict ("No" ≡ "inaccurate"), coverage of all three cases, key evidence (reversed order in 1001/1003, absence in 1002), and emphasis on "always" being violated. It cites case IDs, activities, and timestamps (precisely matching the log) for a short justification as prompted. No errors, guesses, or omissions; minor stylistic differences (paragraph vs. bullets) are irrelevant under strict criteria.
