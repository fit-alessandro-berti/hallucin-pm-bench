2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment against ground truth):
- **Structural mismatch (major penalty, -3.0)**: Different JSON schema ("definitions.process.elements.sequenceFlows.artifacts" vs. flat "process_id/elements/flows"). Non-equivalent formats violate direct comparability.
- **Missing parallel join (-1.5)**: No equivalent to "joinAfterLogging"; Task_6 ("Log Solution") has no outgoing flow (Flow_9 ends there). Broken token flow; ground truth synchronizes.
- **Incorrect wait/timer logic (-2.0)**: Event_1 (timer catch PT24H) → Gateway_3 (eventBased) with "attachedToRef" events is invalid. Forces mandatory 24h wait before any reply check; cannot catch reply within 24h. Ground truth correctly uses eventBasedGateway → customerReply/timer24h branches.
- **Invented elements (-1.0)**: "Process_Scope" subProcess, BoundaryEvent_1, Group_1 artifact, "terminateEndEvent" (ground uses "terminateEndEvent" but loose). Violates "model *only* what is described"; subprocess not in text.
- **Name/ID/attribute diffs (-0.5)**: E.g., "Parse Email and Create Ticket" vs. "Create Ticket"; "Route Ticket" vs. "Simple or Complex?"; conditions "Simple"/"Complex" vs. "simple"/"complex"; extra "eventDefinition", "attachedToRef".
- **Diagram invalidity (-0.5)**: Flows bypass subprocess (StartEvent_1 → Task_1 outside scope); lost token at Task_6; eventBasedGateway misused (incoming from timer catch).
- **Partial matches (+1.0 base)**: Captures start/classify/xor/root/provide/parallel fork/send/log/reminder/close/cancel/terminate core; conditions; PT24H duration faithful.

Total deviations outweigh similarities; critical flow/logic errors prevent functional equivalence.
