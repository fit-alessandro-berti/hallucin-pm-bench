The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth content exactly across all questions:

- **Q1/A1**: Identical ("3").
- **Q2/A2**: Identical sequence ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"). Ground truth escapes (`\_`) are markdown artifacts irrelevant to content accuracy.
- **Q3/A3**: Identical activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered. Ground truth uses HTML (`<br>`, dashes) for table rendering, but LLM adheres strictly to prompt ("one per line"). No extras, omissions, or hallucinations.
