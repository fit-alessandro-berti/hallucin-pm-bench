The LLM answer correctly identifies the key improvement (interrupting boundary timer on `Task_Receive` with flow to `Task_Triage`), ensures SLA compliance by bypassing delays, stays within constraints (no new tasks), and is concise plain English under 120 words. However, strict deductions for: (1) initial suggestion of multiple timers (violates "one improvement"); (2) lacks precise BPMN details like event ID (`Timer_48h`), formal `<timeDuration>PT48H</timeDuration>` syntax, and explicit flow ID; (3) redundant ID reference for existing `Task_Receive`; (4) less explicit on "bypassing document requests." These are significant precision gaps vs. ground truth.
