The LLM answer accurately models all explicitly mentioned flow elements from the prompt, including the required "checks warranty eligibility" task (omitted in the ground truth, which is incomplete per the prompt's requirements). It uses the correct gateways (exclusive for completeness and warranty decision, parallel split/join for step 4), exactly two end events, and proper loop for re-validation. All task names are semantically matching the verbatim bolded phrases (with standard BPMN title casing consistent with the ground truth). IDs are prefixed with "wrc_", no inventions or omissions, and the structure is semantically equivalent to (and more precise than) the ground truth, warranting full credit per the rubric despite minor non-required differences like event/gateway labels and isExecutable attribute.
