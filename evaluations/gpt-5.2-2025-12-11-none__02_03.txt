**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, correctly answering all three questions with precise facts derived from the log (3 cases listed correctly; Pack_Items immediately precedes Ship_Order for C456 after sorting timestamps; Cancel_Order appears once). Format uses concise bullet points as prompted, with minor stylistic variations (e.g., numbering as "1." vs "A1", descriptive labels vs minimal, bolding) that do not alter correctness or conciseness materially. No factual, logical, or significant formatting errors under strict evaluation.
