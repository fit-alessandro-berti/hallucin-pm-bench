**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data for all questions:
- Q1: Identical ("1" occurrence).
- Q2: Identical calculation and result ("5.56%").
- Q3: Identical listing ("A1002").
- Q4: Provides exactly two clear, valid reasons directly matching ground truth options ("Small sample size" with specifics on 4 cases/18 events; "Temporal bias" reframed as "Timeframe/Selection Bias" with accurate log-derived details on ~5-hour single-day window). No hallucinations, inferences beyond logs, or errors. Phrasing is precise, structured, and conservative.
