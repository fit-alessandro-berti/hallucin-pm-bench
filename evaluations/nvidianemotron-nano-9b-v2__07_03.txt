6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Structure and Headings (8/10)**: Headings are verbatim and in the correct order, with no extra commentary or unchanged elements mentioned—fully compliant.
- **Added Tasks (6/10)**: Identifies all three correct tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), but uses incorrect format ("id: name" instead of "id (name)" as specified in the prompt). No dashes, which aligns with ground truth inconsistency but deviates from prompt's parentheses rule. Strict deduction for format errors on every line.
- **Removed Tasks (7/10)**: Correctly identifies the single task (Task_ManualReview), but incorrect format (colon instead of parentheses). Minor alignment with ground truth style, but still non-compliant.
- **Gateway Type Changes (3/10)**: Misses the critical change for Gateway_Payment (exclusive → parallel), listing only one out of two verifiable differences from the XML. Format matches the prompt's example ("id: old → new"), but incompleteness is a major factual error. Ground truth confirms both changes are present.
- **Overall Compliance (5/10 average, adjusted to 6.0 total)**: Output is concise and focused, but factual omission (missing gateway) and consistent format violations (no parentheses for tasks) indicate partial understanding. Strict scoring penalizes these as significant deviations from verifiable differences and specified presentation, preventing a higher score despite strong heading adherence.
