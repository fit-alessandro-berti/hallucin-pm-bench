5.0

ADDED TASKS  
The LLM correctly identified all the added tasks, but did not use the required bullet point (“-”) style. The order is otherwise fine.

REMOVED TASKS  
Correct task, missing bullet point and parentheses around the name, as required.

GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES  
Only one gateway change is listed. The change to Gateway_Payment (exclusive → parallel), which is present in the ground truth, is missing. Also, the correct bullet point formatting is missing.

Summary of mistakes:
- Missing one required gateway type change (serious functional omission).
- Output formatting does not strictly match the instructions (misuse of bullet points and parentheses).
- Slightly inaccurate formatting for tasks and gateways.

Due to missing one out of two functional gateway changes and several formatting/response-structure errors, a strict evaluation gives a 5.0.
