### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Accuracy (Partial Credit: ~4/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two actual sets of concurrent tasks (`Quality_Check` and `Update_Inventory` for the first parallel split; `Generate_Replenishment_Report` and `Notify_Procurement` for the second). No extraneous tasks from Process B are included, and task names match exactly.
- **Structural and Formatting Errors (Major Deduction: -4/10)**: The ground truth numbers only the two relevant sets (1 and 2) with clear labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**" and uses consistent formatting (`code` blocks and ‖ symbol for parallelism). The LLM incorrectly numbers four items (including irrelevant merges as #2 and #4), treats merges as "sets" with "(no concurrent tasks)" (which misrepresents the prompt's focus on *tasks* in *parallel constructs*, not merges), and uses inconsistent formatting (e.g., "|| Parallel Split #1 ||:" with bullets instead of the ground truth's style). This adds unasked-for and misleading content, violating the prompt's instruction to list "each set of tasks that can execute concurrently."
- **Completeness (Minor Deduction: -1/10)**: The LLM lacks the ground truth's explicit closing statement ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel"), which confirms scope without extras. While implied, its absence under strictness reduces clarity.
- **Strictness Applied**: Even though the concurrent tasks are factually right, the deviations in numbering, inclusion of merges, and formatting are not minor—they fundamentally alter the response structure and introduce noise, leading to a low overall score. No credit for adherence to ground truth's concise, precise presentation.
