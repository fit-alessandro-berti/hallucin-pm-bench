The LLM answer is semantically and structurally identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying and listing all three parallel blocks from Process B with no omissions, additions, or sequential tasks included. Minor formatting differences (e.g., single vs. double spaces after commas) do not constitute content errors and thus warrant no deduction under strict evaluation focused on accuracy and adherence to the prompt.
