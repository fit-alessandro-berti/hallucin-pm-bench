**9.0**

1. The numeric answers are fully correct:
   - Q1: "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1** time – correct.
   - Q2a: (1/48)*100 = **2.08%** – correct.
   - Q2b: (1/12)*100 = **8.33%** – correct.

2. The explanation in Q3 is contextually appropriate, noting both rarity and risk of overgeneralisation in analyses. It states: "Generalizing from this small sample risks assuming it’s insignificant when it might actually be a critical indicator… This could lead to inaccurate process improvement recommendations or flawed predictive models if the dataset is too limited to represent the broader population." This broadly covers (i) the single-occurrence, (ii) possible misestimation or instability, and (iii) overgeneralisation risk.

However, there are (minor) points lost for not explicitly mentioning that any statistic is based on a **single** observation, thereby especially susceptible to noise or high variance—which the ground truth required.

**Deducted 1 point** due to that missing explicit mention and slightly less technical precision about the sensitivity to noise/variance.

**Final Score: 9.0**
