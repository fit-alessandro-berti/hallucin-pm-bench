8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect match (1 occurrence). No loss.
- **Question 2a & 2b**: Exact match on calculations and rounding (2.08% and 8.33%). No loss.
- **Question 3**: Partial match. The response is concise (â‰¤100 words) and cautions against over-generalization (iii), while implying single-occurrence via "rarity" and "small sample" (i, partially). However, it fails to explicitly note variance/instability (ii), such as noise in single observations, skewed averages, or wide confidence intervals, which are core to the ground truth's emphasis on statistical unreliability. This omission reduces depth and precision, warranting a deduction under strict criteria.

Overall, strong on facts but incomplete on explanatory rigor for Q3, leading to the score.
