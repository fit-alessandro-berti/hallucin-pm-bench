### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences: the two added tasks (`check_vip` and `generate_qr`), the one removed task (`send_rma_label`), and the gateway type change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive. This matches the core content of the ground truth with no omissions or additions. However, under utmost strictness, the following small but notable differences result in a deduction of 2.0 points:
- **Format inconsistencies**: Uses "-" bullets instead of "*" as in ground truth; headings use "###" (H3 markdown) instead of "**" (bold italics); lists IDs first with bolding (e.g., "**check_vip** (Check Customer VIP Status)"), while ground truth prioritizes names first (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)").
- **Gateway description**: Omits version specifics "(v1)" and "(v2)" and bolding on gateway types, making it less precise than ground truth's "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)".
- No extraneous speculation, but lacks the ground truth's closing note "(No other differences should be reported.)", though this is minor since the prompt does not require it.

These formatting and phrasing variances, while not altering facts, deviate from the ground truth's exact structure and style, warranting a significant but not severe penalty.
