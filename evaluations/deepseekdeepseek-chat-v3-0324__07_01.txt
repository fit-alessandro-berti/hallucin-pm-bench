9.5

The LLM answer is nearly perfect, accurately listing every change under the correct headings and using the element names from the XML as instructed. The only minor deviation is that the LLM omits the id in parentheses for the removed and added tasks, whereas the ground truth includes the `id = ...` explicitly within parentheses for each task. This is a small, but clear deviation from the strict ground truth format.

Scoring with utmost strictness, this small formatting omission warrants a 0.5 point deduction:

- Task names and IDs are correct and nothing extra is included.
- The wording and detail on gateway type change is accurate, though not verbatim matching the bold styling of the ground truth.

Thus, the answer deserves a 9.5.
