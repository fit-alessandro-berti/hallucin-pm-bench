3.0

**Explanation:**

- **Mandated Vocabulary:** The answer generally uses "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst," but adds role assignments not requested (all tasks "Transaction Analyst" for R and A), e.g. for KYC Review tasks, it lists "Transaction Analyst" as R/A/C/I instead of making "Regulatory Liaison" Responsible. It also omits the use of "Operations Manager" found in the ground-truth answer.
- **Structure:** Some extra rows were added not required by the prompt ("Perform KYC Review (Sender)", "Perform KYC Review (Beneficiary)" split; "Notify Regulatory Liaison"), and the mapping of source activities to table rows is not faithful to the ground truth (e.g., KYC Review and High-Risk Approval are not consolidated properly).
- **RACI Assignments:** Nearly every task marks Transaction Analyst as both Responsible and Accountable, which doesn't reflect the separation of duties shown in the ground truth (e.g., KYC Review actually has Regulatory Liaison as Responsible, Operations Manager is Accountable, and Transaction Analyst is merely Consulted).
- **Errors in Role Usage:** For "Screen Against Sanctions List," the ground truth makes Transaction Analyst Responsible and Regulatory Liaison Accountable, but the LLM answer just gives everything to Transaction Analyst.
- **Missing Role:** There is no "Operations Manager" at all, which leads to incorrect accountability assignments.
- **Small Mistakes (with strictness):** The task descriptions are sometimes too verbose or split, the roles and columns are not exactly matching the ground truth, and the RACI attributions are often not justifiable per the steps described.

**Conclusion:**  
Multiple non-trivial mistakes, missing mandated roles, incorrect RACI assignments, and extra or poorly-mapped tasks lead to a very low score. It's not a 1.0 because the structure and use of some mandated vocabulary is present, but the errors are sufficiently major (especially the missing "Operations Manager" and incorrect role assignments) to warrant an extremely low mark.
