2.0

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and accuracy, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Table format**: The LLM uses a traditional RACI-columns layout (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), while the ground truth uses roles as columns with R/A/C/I letters in cells (a common but distinct RACI variant). This is a structural mismatch, and the LLM's bolding/legend absence further differs from the ground truth's use of bold for R/A and explicit legend.

- **Roles**: The LLM limits to mandated roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison) plus IT Support from the source, but assigns them incorrectly across columns (e.g., frequent repetition of the same role in all RACI fields, violating RACI principles). The ground truth introduces an unmandated "Operations Manager" role (an error in itself, but as reference, this highlights the LLM's failure to align). No shared role assignments match.

- **Tasks coverage and naming**: The LLM expands to 9 granular tasks (e.g., separate KYC for sender/beneficiary, explicit SWIFT transmission, and notification), over-splitting the source while using non-exact phrasing (e.g., "Receive Customer Transfer Instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record"). It covers more source steps (e.g., explicit notification and SWIFT, absent in ground truth) but introduces unsubtle variations. The ground truth consolidates to 6 tasks with mandated phrasing (e.g., bold "**KYC Review**" combining sender/beneficiary). This results in incomplete alignment, with the LLM's extra tasks not matching.

- **RACI assignments**: Fundamentally mismatched and incorrect relative to both source and ground truth. For example:
  - KYC Review: LLM incorrectly assigns Responsible/Accountable to Transaction Analyst (with Regulatory Liaison only Consulted), reversing the source (Regulatory Liaison performs it); ground truth correctly has Regulatory Liaison as Responsible/Accountable.
  - High-Risk Approval: LLM assigns Responsible/Accountable to Transaction Analyst; ground truth (and source) to Regulatory Liaison.
  - Screening: LLM all-Transaction Analyst; ground truth Responsible Transaction Analyst but Accountable Regulatory Liaison.
  - Other tasks (e.g., Release, Archive) have partial overlaps but differ in Consulted/Informed (e.g., LLM's SWIFT task assigns Consulted to Transaction Analyst; ground truth omits it entirely).
  These are major errors, as RACI is the core output—small misassignments would deduct points, but wholesale reversal of responsibilities is severe.

- **Additional elements**: The LLM adds a title ("AtlasRemit – Payment Processing Process: RACI Matrix"), introductory text ("Okay, here’s..."), and a closing note explaining vocabulary adherence (unprompted and extraneous). The ground truth is purely the table with legend and brief explanatory bullet. This bloats the output unnecessarily.

- **Vocabulary adherence**: Both use mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") correctly, a minor positive. However, the LLM's improper application (e.g., assigning KYC responsibility to Transaction Analyst despite source mapping to Regulatory Liaison) undermines this.

Overall, while the LLM attempts completeness and Markdown formatting, the pervasive differences in task granularity, incorrect role mappings, and RACI inaccuracies (especially core responsibilities) result in near-total misalignment with the ground truth, justifying a minimal score. Even minor phrasing variances (e.g., "Screen Payment Against" vs. "Screen Against") compound the deduction under utmost strictness.
