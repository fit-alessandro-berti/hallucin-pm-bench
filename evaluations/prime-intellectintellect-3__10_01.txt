**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary policy violation (major deduction, -4.0)**: Mandated terms used correctly in matrix rows ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"). However, notes explicitly mention all three forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") in quotes, directly breaching "do **not** mention the forbidden terms, even in brackets or quotes." This is a complete failure on a STRICT policy.
- **RACI correctness (major deduction, -3.0)**: Matrix structure present, but allocations do not match ground truth:
  | Activity | LLM | Ground Truth Differences |
  |----------|-----|--------------------------|
  | Receive Application | AM A only | Misses CO C, FC/IT I; AM is R/A not just A. |
  | KYC Review | CO A only | Misses AM A, CO R, FC C, IT I. |
  | Order Vetting | AM A only | Misses CO C, FC/IT I; AM is R/A. |
  | Payment Clearance | FC A only | Misses AM A, CO C, IT I; FC is R. |
  | Record Update | IT A only | Misses AM/FC C, CO I; IT is R (no bold). |
  | Notify Customer | AM A only | Misses all I's; AM is R/A. |
  - No R/C/I populated (blanks ≠ explicit I/C); treats A as "responsible" (misaligns RACI standards); ignores narrative implications (e.g., sequencing implies consultations/informings). Rubric requires "each activity has exactly one *Responsible*" and "Account Manager is *Accountable* where appropriate" – LLM fails both.
- **Formatting/Completeness (minor but strict deduction, -1.0)**: Headers add unwarranted (ABBRs); unnecessary RACI key & self-referential notes ("No forbidden terms are used" is false); bolding inconsistent (only rows, not key cells like ground truth).
- **Unwarranted content**: Extra notes introduce forbidden terms & legacy explanations (rubric violation).
- **Partial credit (+1.0)**: Correct activity row labels & basic performers as A (aligns loosely with process owners).

Total differences are extensive (content, policy, detail); score reflects utmost strictness.
