### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies the excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) with matching waiting times, grounding directly in the table data without invention. It uses bullet points exclusively for the three concrete, data-driven recommendations (e.g., referencing specific waits and case volumes from the table), adhering to instructions on metrics and structure for recs.

However, under strict criteria, it loses points for: (1) lacking a formal memo header (To/From/Subject) present in ground truth, making it less executive/polished; (2) no introductory context (e.g., total cases or subject line), reducing completeness; (3) including case counts in the activity descriptions (not in ground truth's listings, though data-provided); (4) recommendations differ in specificity and phrasing (e.g., LLM's capacity-focused vs. ground truth's process innovations like pre-checks or heuristics, which invent untable elements like "€25k" despite instructions); (5) absence of a closing projection sentence. These structural and content variances, including small format deviations, warrant a deduction from perfect, but core compliance is strong. Word count ≈160, close to target.
