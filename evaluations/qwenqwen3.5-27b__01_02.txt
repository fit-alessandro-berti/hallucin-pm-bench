### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying and summarizing the exact three decision points (**Underwriter Alignment Gate**, **Amount Threshold Decision**, **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**) with precise conditions/outcomes matching the process flow and prompt terminology. All required documents are listed completely and faithfully to the prompt's phrasing (e.g., retaining "single pay-stub or tax slip" and "(CIS) template", where GT shortens them). No standard loan terminology introduced.

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total, reflecting strictness on small differences):**
- **Formatting/style (-0.3):** "###" vs GT's "####"; bullets/sub-bullets vs concise numbered/single-line; extra "***" separator; bolder/more verbose structure absent in GT.
- **Phrasing/verbosity (-0.3):** 
  - Underwriter Gate: Adds "step 6" and fuller condition detail (e.g., "Compare risk scores (0–9)"); GT more concise with "branch after Dual Underwriter Split".
  - Amount Threshold: Omits "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"; "Proceed to" vs "send to"; adds intro "Evaluate loan amount against €15 000 limit".
  - MBA: Repeats threshold condition unnecessarily; "*approve* or *reject*" (italics, lowercase matching prompt) vs GT "**Approve** or **Reject**" (bold, caps).
- **Documents (-0.1):** Bullets vs numbered; exact prompt phrasing better than GT in places (e.g., "≤ 3 months old", "single...or"), but header "Required Documents at Submission Time" vs "(complete list)"; lacks GT's extra explanatory note.
- **Headers (-0.1):** "Decision Points" (plural/capital P) vs "Decision points"; minor casing.

No major errors, omissions, or inaccuracies—content fidelity >95%. Differences are stylistic/phrasing only, but strictness mandates point loss.
