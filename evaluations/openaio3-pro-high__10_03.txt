5.5

**Rationale:**

- **Vocabulary compliance:** The answer adheres to the strict vocabulary rules: only “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, and “Risk Scoring” appear for the four controlled activities. No forbidden synonyms are present.
- **Activity coverage/issues:** The LLM answer incorrectly includes additional activities (“Schedule Payment” and “Notify Originating Analyst”) not in the ground truth and omits the “Release Funds” activity as specified (instead, it splits it into “Release Funds” and “Notify Originating Analyst”).
- **Roles per activity:**
    - For all four core activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring):
        - The "Accountable" (A) designation is almost always combined with "Responsible" (R) for the same role, consistently, even where the ground truth splits R and A.
        - For “Risk Scoring”, the ground truth assigns “Responsible” to Compliance Analyst and “Accountable” to Compliance Officer, but the LLM assigns both R/A to Compliance Analyst (loss of accuracy).
        - The matrix frequently overuses the “I” (Informed) and “C” (Consulted) roles, sometimes assigning these where the ground truth shows inactivity (“–”).
    - In “Compliance Officer Approval”: LLM splits R/A between “Compliance Officer” and “Compliance Analyst”, while the ground truth concentrates both (R, A) with Compliance Officer only.
    - “Release Funds” in the LLM answer leaves Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer as “I” (Informed), but ground truth gives both “C” (Consulted).
- **Format:** Markdown table is correct; activities are not merged/renamed, though LLM introduces new (unauthorized) activities, which is an error.
- **Participation markers:** LLM always uses “I” for “not involved” instead of the required dash “–”.
- **Degree of strictness:** The errors with incorrect/extra activities, mishandled R/A, and occasional involvement where not indicated by the ground truth, are substantial.

**Summary:**  
- Accurate vocabulary: **+2 points**
- Activity coverage: **-1.5 points** (extras included, some omitted/incorrect mapping)
- Incorrect R/A split in key activities: **-1**
- Frequent minor mapping errors ("I" instead of "–", over-attribution): **-1**
- Consulted/Informed designations diverge repeatedly from ground truth: **-1**
- Markdown compliance: **+1**

**Final: 5.5/10**  
It is passable on vocabulary and structure, but the RACI mapping and activity list are materially incorrect under strict grading.
