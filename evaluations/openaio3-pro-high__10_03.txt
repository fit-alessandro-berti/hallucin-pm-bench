The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms without synonyms or leaks. However, it violates the instruction to not add activities by including unauthorized extras ("Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst"), which are not present in the ground truth and exceed the described core activities. It also omits or merges elements like notification into an extra row, further deviating from "do not rename, merge, or add."

RACI assignments contain numerous inaccuracies compared to the ground truth, including:
- Incorrect roles for Intake Vetting (Compliance Officer: I vs. –).
- Front-Office Analyst marked as Consulted instead of no involvement for KYC Review and AML Screening (– vs. C).
- Compliance Officer as Informed instead of Consulted for KYC Review and AML Screening (I vs. C), and Informed instead of Accountable for Risk Scoring (I vs. A).
- Compliance Analyst as R/A instead of solely R for Risk Scoring.
- Treasury Ops as Informed instead of no involvement for Compliance Officer Approval (I vs. –).
- Compliance Analyst and Officer as Informed instead of Consulted for Release Funds (I vs. C).

Formatting mismatches include using "R/A" shorthand instead of "**R, A**" with bolding, lacking bold activity names, and using empty cells instead of dashes (–) for no involvement. These cumulative errors—especially additions and widespread RACI mismatches—result in a low score under strict evaluation, where even minor deviations warrant significant deductions.
