**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Structural differences (major deduction: -3.0)**: LLM adds unrequested title (# header), introductory text ("Below is..."), separate ## Legend and ## Role Definitions sections. Ground truth is concise: direct Markdown table + minimal legend + bullet notes. Extra content deviates significantly.
- **Roles mismatch (major deduction: -2.0)**: LLM uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support. Ground truth includes Operations Manager (as A in every row). No Operations Manager = incomplete column match.
- **Task coverage/naming (major deduction: -1.5)**: LLM has 7 tasks (splits source step 5 into release/SWIFT, adds explicit #7 archive). Ground truth has exactly 6, omits explicit SWIFT but shortens names (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. LLM's verbose "Receive transfer instruction and log in system"). Extra task, verbose phrasing, no exact matches.
- **RACI assignments (major deduction: -1.5)**: No row fully matches. Partial similarities (e.g., R on Transaction Analyst for receive/screen/release; R on Regulatory Liaison for KYC/approve; I on Regulatory Liaison for some; R on IT for archive) but systematic differences: LLM combines R/A on doer role; uses — for blanks; no consistent A on Operations Manager; differing C/I (e.g., task 2: LLM C Regulatory Liaison vs. GT A Regulatory Liaison).
- **Formatting details (minor but strict deduction: -0.5)**: LLM bold-tasks only, plain R/A/C/I, uses —, colons in headers. Ground truth bolds **R**/**A** in cells, full cells (no —), precise header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), mandated wording emphasized (**KYC Review**).
- **Vocabulary/mandate adherence**: Both use mandated terms correctly (no deduction), but irrelevant for diff-based grading.
- **Overall**: ~20% similarity (shared roles/tasks/vocab/legend concept). Strict policy demands near-identical match for high score; cumulative differences yield low grade.
