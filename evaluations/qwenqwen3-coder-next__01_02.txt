9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Content Accuracy (no factual errors, full match):** Both identify the exact 3 decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)) with identical conditions, using precise terminology from the process (e.g., ≤2 points difference, <€15 000 auto-approve, ≥€15 000 to MBA, approve/reject vote). All 6 required documents listed exactly as per prompt/system (no omissions/additions). LLM matches prompt phrasing more closely on several docs (e.g., "≤ 3 months old", "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template"). Semantic perfection = base 10.0.

**Differences/Phrasing/Style Deductions (strict, per small variance):**
- **Headers (-0.2):** LLM "**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process**" and "**Required Documents at Submission Time**" vs ground "#### Decision points" / "#### Required documents (complete list)". Extra descriptive words ("in Acme’s...", "at Submission Time").
- **Decision Points Structure (-0.3):** LLM verbose with sub-bullets ("– Decision:", "– Condition:", "*or*", step refs "step 6/step 8", explicit names "Senior...Shadow", "*Approve* or *Reject*", trigger details for #3). Ground concise (*if/else ⇒*, positions like "branch after Dual Underwriter Split"/"after Neighbourhood Feedback Check", no steps). Added details accurate but deviate from ground's minimalism.
- **Documents List (-0.1):** Bullets vs numbered; inconsistent bolding on (**ML-APP-01**/**CIS**/**NFF**) vs plain (); minor phrasing matches prompt better but differs (e.g., full "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs shortened "pay-stub/tax slip"; "template" included vs omitted).
- **Notes (-0.1):** LLM "(Note: No credit-bureau report or standard credit check documentation...)" vs ground "*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents...)*". Similar intent, different wording ("credit-bureau"/hyphen, "credit check" vs "collateral forms/other").
- **Formatting/Minor (-0.1):** **bold**, *italics*, --- separator, "requested amount" vs "amount". No intro of standard terminology.

Total deductions: -0.8. **Final: 9.2**. Excellent, near-identical utility; differences stylistic/verbose, not substantive errors.
