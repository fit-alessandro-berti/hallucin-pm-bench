**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies overall "Non-compliant". Accurately detects Rule 2 violation (correct events 8 vs. 9). Captures essence of Rule 3 violation (TWM too late after event 6).
- **Major flaws (severe deductions)**:
  - **Rule 3 inaccuracy**: Claims "four activities" but lists only three (7-9); misnames activity 7 as "Movement to Quality" vs. "Move_to_Quality". Ground truth specifies "distance=3".
  - **Rule 4 fabrication**: Entirely wrong—falsely claims Intern (7) "directly follows" CFO (3), ignoring intervening events 4-6. Ground truth confirms Rule 4 *satisfied*. Irrelevant mention of events 8-9.
  - **Incomplete analysis**: Ignores Rules 1 and 5 (both satisfied per ground truth); does not systematically check all rules.
  - **Format/Structure**: Lacks ground truth's comprehensive per-rule numbering and conclusion summarizing violated rules.
- **Strictness applied**: Factual errors (esp. Rule 4 hallucination) and omissions are major deviations, warranting low score despite partial overlap on Rules 2-3.
