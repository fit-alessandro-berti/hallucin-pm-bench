8.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate in core content: correct "Yes" for Q1, identical minimal sequence for Q2 (T1-T2-T7-T4-T5), and a valid explanation demonstrating the alternative path to P5 while preserving P2 token, complying with ≤120 words (~95 words).

**Deductions (strict):**
- **-0.5**: Minor factual inaccuracy in explanation—"before T3 is enabled or fired." T3 is enabled after T1 (P2 marked), though not fired. Sloppy wording misrepresents enabling.
- **-0.5**: No explicit markings (M1–M5) as in ground truth, reducing precision in verifying reachability; relies on prose description.
- **-0.5**: Slightly verbose Q1 phrasing vs. ground truth's concise "**Q1. Yes.**"; explanation bundled under Q2 vs. separated brief Q1 rationale.

Overall, excellent match but small errors/omissions warrant deductions per strict criteria.
