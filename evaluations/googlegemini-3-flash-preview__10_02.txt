**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (mandated terms: +1.0):** LLM perfectly uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”; no violations like CDD or Compliance Officer. Matches GT intent.
- **Table structure (Markdown RACI: +1.0):** Valid Markdown table with clear roles/tasks; includes legend/key. Minor deduction for extra intro text/title not in GT (-0.2); uses "R / A" vs GT's bold single letters (**R** etc.); "-" vs explicit letters.
- **Roles (-1.5):** LLM: 3 roles (TA, RL, IT Support). GT: 4 roles (adds unprompted "Operations Manager" as universal **A**). Missing role = major mismatch.
- **Task coverage/naming (-2.0):** LLM covers all 6 source steps but splits into 7 (e.g., extra "Dispatch SWIFT Message"; "Log Transfer Instruction" vs GT "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Execute KYC Review" adds "Execute"; "Archive Case File" vs "Archive Record"). GT condenses (no explicit SWIFT/log distinction, 6 tasks). Names differ significantly; doesn't match GT's "(mandated wording)" phrasing or bolding.
- **RACI assignments (-2.3):** Core content mismatches ~80%:
  | LLM Task | Key LLM | GT Closest | Match? |
  |----------|---------|------------|--------|
  | Log... | TA R/A, RL I | Receive: TA **R**, RL I, Ops **A**, IT C | Partial (TA/RL); misses Ops/IT. |
  | Screen... | TA R/A, RL C | Screen: TA **R**, RL **A**, Ops I, IT C | TA **R**; RL C vs **A**. |
  | KYC... | TA C, RL R/A | **KYC Review**: TA C, RL **R**, Ops **A**, IT I | Good (TA/RL); misses others. |
  | Approval | TA I, RL R/A | Approve: TA C, RL **R**, Ops **A**, IT I | TA I vs C; RL good. |
  | Release | TA R/A, RL I, IT C | Release: TA **R**, RL I, Ops **A**, IT C | Good except TA **A** vs Ops. |
  | Dispatch (extra) | TA I, IT R/A | N/A | Unmatched addition. |
  | Archive | TA I, RL I, IT R/A | Archive: TA C, RL I, Ops **A**, IT **R** | Partial; TA I vs C. |
  - Systematic errors: LLM overloads R/A on performers (TA/RL/IT); GT delegates **A** to Ops Manager everywhere. Significant deviations per strictness rule.
- **Overall fidelity to GT/prompt (-0.8):** Covers source without omissions but interpretive RACI diverges; extra content; no exact replication. Small diffs (e.g., wording, bolding, cell format) amplify loss.

Total raw: Matches ~32% content precisely → scaled to 3.2 (not 1.0 as vocab/table basics met, but core RACI/roles/tasks fail strictly).
