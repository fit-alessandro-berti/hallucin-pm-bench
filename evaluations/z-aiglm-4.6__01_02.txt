5.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points Section (Major Deductions, ~60% weight)**: The LLM incorrectly includes "Quick KYC Verification (KYC)" as a decision point (an extra, non-branching verification step not listed in the ground truth, introducing an unauthorized element and deviating from the prompt's focus on true branching decisions). It covers the three core points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) but uses a verbose "Decision/Outcome" structure instead of the ground truth's concise conditional format (e.g., "*If ... ⇒ ...*"). It omits key flow context from the ground truth, such as "after the Dual Underwriter Split" for Alignment Gate and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for Amount Threshold. Minor phrasing tweaks (e.g., "the Final Micro-loan Board" vs. "Final Micro-loan Board Approval") and added details (e.g., "for applications ≥ €15 000") further misalign. This section shows significant structural and content differences, warranting a low sub-score (~3.0/10).
- **Required Documents Section (Minor Deductions, ~40% weight)**: The list is complete and accurate in content, matching all six items without additions or omissions. However, it uses bullets instead of the ground truth's numbered list; includes phrasing variations not in the ground truth (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"); and omits the ground truth's parenthetical note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"). Under strict evaluation, these small structural and wording errors cause point loss (~7.0/10 sub-score).
- **Overall**: No introduction of standard loan terminology (positive). Strict assessment penalizes the extraneous decision point and flow omissions heavily, balanced slightly by document completeness, yielding 5.5.
