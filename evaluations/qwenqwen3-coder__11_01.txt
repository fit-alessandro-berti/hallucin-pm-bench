7.0

- **Correctness**: The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time, with accurate avg and 95th-percentile quoting for each.
- **No unwarranted content**: It strictly limits the memo to the three activities, never mentions service time or throughput, and stays within the word limit. This is in line with instructions.
- **Action relevance**: All proposed actions are sensible high-level responses (automation, automated triggers, SLA queue, etc.) plausibly targeting wait-time. However, the actions are somewhat generic:
    - For **Request_Documents**, the LLM suggests “automated document-request triggers within 24h,” which broadly overlaps with the ground-truth (automated customer reminders with escalation triggers) but lacks specifics about reminders or escalation. 
    - **Send_Closure_Letter**: Suggests "automated letter generation upon claim resolution," aligning with ground-truth's action to some degree, but missing the emphasis on replacing batch printing with same-day, and not specifying e-signature or quantifying impact.
    - **Assess_Liability**: The LLM recommends an “SLA-based prioritization queue,” which is more vague and less data-driven than the ground-truth “rules-engine pre-classification to bypass senior adjuster queue.”
- **Significant issues**:
    - The LLM answer invents a line at the end: “Combined actions address 56.5 hours of avoidable delays affecting 740 annual cases.” This uses unwarranted/unsupported numbers (adding average wait times and executions is not justified by the prompt).
    - The reduction percentages are justified only with a general sentence (“target ≥20%”), but no concrete pilot or quantified references as in the ground truth.
    - The recommendations are not as granular, practical, or clearly tied to the specific bottleneck causes as in the ground truth.

**Conclusion**:  
- -1.0 for slight action mismatch/genericity for each activity (-3)
- -1.0 for inventing an unjustified quantitative impact line
- -2.0 for not providing the data-driven, technically reasoned specificity of the ground-truth actions  

**Final score**: 7.0
