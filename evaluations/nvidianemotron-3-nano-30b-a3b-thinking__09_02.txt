The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps or durations as the reason the average cycle time cannot be computed, in a single concise sentence matching the prompt's requirements. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; specifying activity points vs. mentioning event counts explicitly) do not alter correctness or completeness under strict evaluation.
