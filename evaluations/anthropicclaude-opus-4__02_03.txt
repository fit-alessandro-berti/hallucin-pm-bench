**Score: 9.0**

**Justification:**

- The LLM answer is highly accurate and well-structured, with the following notable points:
  - All 3 questions are answered correctly.
  - The answer format uses concise bullet points, as requested.
  - For question 2, the LLM expands with a timeline breakdown. This is not required (the prompt says "concise"), but it still keeps the direct answer clear and on the first line.
  - For question 3, the LLM gives a count breakdown for all activities, which is additional and not strictly necessary but can be argued as concise support for its answer.

**Strictness / Error:**
- The answer is not as terse or minimal as the expected ground truth ("Pack_Items" alone for Q2, "Cancel_Order" alone for Q3). Instead, the LLM adds extra explanations and reasoning, which the instructions indicate should be penalized (since strict conciseness was required).
- Accordingly, I subtract 1 full point even though core facts are right, in line with the directive that "even small errors should reflect in significant loss of points."

**Summary:**
- All facts correct, but extra information and slightly looser formatting than expected.  
- **Score: 9.0**
