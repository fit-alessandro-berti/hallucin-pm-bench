- The LLM answer correctly identifies all three elements (3 cases with exact matches to C123, C456, C789; "Pack_Items" as the predecessor for C456's "Ship_Order"; "Cancel_Order" as the unique activity once), with no factual errors.
- Minor deduction for extraneous introductory text ("Looking at...") and explanatory sub-bullets (timeline and frequencies), violating the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction, which introduces unnecessary verbosity compared to the ground truth's brevity.
