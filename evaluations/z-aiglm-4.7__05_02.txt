The LLM answer proposes an entirely different modification (adding `camunda:candidateGroups` to `Task_CreateRecord` instead of changing `camunda:dueDate` on `Task_CollectEquipment` from "P5D" to "P2D`), with a mismatched rationale focused on task assignment rather than overall cycle time/SLA alignment, resulting in zero similarity to the ground truth diff or explanation despite superficially valid format.
