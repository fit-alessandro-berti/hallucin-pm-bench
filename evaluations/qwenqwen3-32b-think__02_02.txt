The LLM answer is fully correct in all three parts:

- **Q1:** Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases.
- **Q2:** Precisely provides the ordered sequence of activities for case C002: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order".
- **Q3:** Correctly lists every distinct activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order", sorted alphabetically: "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock".

No inaccuracies, omissions, or hallucinations are present. The style and activity names exactly match the ground truth. The explanatory section is correct, clear, and doesn't introduce any contradictions or extra elements.
