6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Correct (1 occurrence). Full points.
- **Question 2a**: Incorrect total events (49 instead of 48, as explicitly stated in the prompt) leading to wrong percentage (2.04% instead of 2.08%). This is a factual counting error directly from supplied data, violating the "answer only from the data supplied" rule. Significant deduction for strictness.
- **Question 2b**: Correct (8.33%). Full points.
- **Question 3**: Adequate explanation (â‰¤100 words, covers single occurrence issue, instability/outlier risk, and caution against generalization/overfitting). Aligns with ground truth requirements, though wording varies slightly. Full points.
- **Overall**: Strong on most elements, but the core data miscount in 2a undermines accuracy and reliability, warranting a moderate score despite minor numerical deviation.
