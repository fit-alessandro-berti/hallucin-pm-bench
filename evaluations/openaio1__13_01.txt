The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth across all questions, with exact matches for Q1 (1 occurrence), Q2 (5.56% with correct calculation), and Q3 (identifies A1002 as the sole case). For Q4, both reasons provided (temporal bias via single-day coverage and small/non-random sample size leading to bias) align directly with two of the ground truth examples (temporal bias and small sample size), stated clearly without inference or hallucination. Minor deduction (-0.2) for slight wording variations in Q3 (omits "only" and activity name escaping, though semantically equivalent) and Q4 (adds "not randomly collected" as an elaboration, which is valid but not explicitly in ground truth phrasing). No other deviations.
