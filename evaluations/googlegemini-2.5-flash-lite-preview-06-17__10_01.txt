### Evaluation Score: 2.5

#### Detailed Assessment
I evaluated the LLM answer with utmost strictness against the ground truth, focusing on **correctness** (RACI allocations must reflect the process narrative with exactly one *Responsible* per activity, appropriate *Accountable* roles—especially for the Account Manager—and proper use of R/A where the same role is both; mandated terminology must appear without forbidden variants; C vs. I distinctions must match), **unwarranted content** (no extras like introductions, abbreviations, or deviations in structure), and overall fidelity. Even minor mismatches (e.g., C vs. I, missing R, or formatting) incur significant deductions, as per instructions.

- **Vocabulary Policy Adherence (Positive, but Minor Weight: +1.0 point base)**: The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exclusively, with exact spelling/capitalization and no forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing"). This matches the ground truth. No deduction here.

- **Structure and Content Fidelity (Major Issues: -4.0 points)**:
  - **Table Format**: The LLM introduces unwarranted abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") in column headers, while the ground truth uses full names only (no abbreviations). This adds extraneous content. The LLM also includes an introductory sentence ("Here is the RACI matrix..."), which is not present in the ground truth and constitutes unwarranted content.
  - **Activity Rows**: Matches exactly (same order, six activities), with preferred terms in place. No extras or omissions.
  - **Bolding/Formatting**: The ground truth uses bolding (e.g., **KYC Review**, **R / A**) for emphasis on key terms and roles. The LLM lacks any bolding, reducing clarity and fidelity.

- **RACI Allocations (Core Correctness: Severe Errors, -4.5 points)**:
  - The process narrative specifies clear owners: AM handles Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer (R/A); CO performs KYC Review (R, with AM A); FC initiates Payment Clearance (R, with AM A); IT refreshes Record Update (R). Ground truth reflects this with one R per activity, R/A where AM owns/approves, A for AM oversight, C/I appropriately (C for consulted, I for informed only).
  - LLM systematically deviates, violating RACI principles (e.g., no R in some rows, overuse of C instead of I, incorrect A/R assignments). Breakdown per row (each error deducts heavily due to strictness):
    1. **Receive Application**: LLM (A-AM, C-others) lacks any R (invalid RACI—must have one Responsible per activity per narrative). Ground: R/A-AM, C-CO, I-FC/IT. Mismatch on AM (A vs. R/A), others (all C vs. C/I/I). Major error.
    2. **KYC Review**: LLM (C-AM, R-CO, C-FC/IT) mismatches AM (C vs. A), FC/IT (C vs. C/I). CO correct (R). Narrative implies AM accountability; LLM demotes to consulted.
    3. **Order Vetting**: LLM (R-AM, C-others) mismatches AM (R vs. R/A), others (all C vs. C/I/I). No accountability shown for AM per narrative.
    4. **Payment Clearance**: LLM (C-AM, C-CO, R-FC, C-IT) mismatches AM (C vs. A), IT (C vs. I). FC correct (R); CO correct (C). Ignores AM oversight.
    5. **Record Update**: LLM (C-all except R-IT) mismatches CO (C vs. I). AM/FC/IT partially align (C/C/R vs. C/C/R), but overuses C.
    6. **Notify Customer**: LLM (R-AM, C-others) mismatches AM (R vs. R/A), others (all C vs. I/I/I). No AM accountability.
  - Overall: Only ~30% of cells match (e.g., Rs for CO/FC/IT are correct, some Cs). No row is fully accurate. Fails "exactly one Responsible" and "AM accountable where appropriate" from rubric. C is overused vs. I (narrative implies minimal consultation, more informing post-task).

- **Unwarranted Content (Minor but Deducted: -0.5 points)**: Introductory text and abbreviations are extras not in ground truth.

- **Total Score Calculation**: Starts at 10.0; deduct for structure (-4.0, ~40% impact due to core RACI focus); deduct for RACI errors (-4.5, ~45% impact—multiple per-row violations); deduct for extras (-0.5); vocabulary bonus (+1.0 caps it). Nets 2.5. The LLM captures the shell (terms/table) but mangles the substance (RACI logic), warranting a low score under strict evaluation.
