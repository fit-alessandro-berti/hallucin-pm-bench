6.0

**Reasoning:**

- The LLM answer **correctly used the mandated synonyms**: "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance", and did NOT use the forbidden terms. This is a strong positive.
- The **RACI role assignments are largely incorrect** in detail compared to the ground truth, which is a severe issue:

    - For every activity, the LLM answer fills almost every cell with “C” except for a single “R” per row, violating the need for proper RACI differentiation.
    - It omits all "Accountable" assignments. Where "R / A" is correct (Account Manager for Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer), it only marks "R".
    - "Payment Clearance" correctly gives "R" to Finance Clerk, but forgets Account Manager as Accountable (should be A), and the others do not match ground truth (should be C/I).
    - The pattern is repeated for other activities; e.g., for "KYC Review", Account Manager should be A, but is listed "C".
    - "Notify Customer": Should have "R/A" for AM, "I" for all others; instead, marks AM as "R", others as "C".

- **Capitalisation and wording**: The terms are used with correct capitalisation and spelling.

- **Matrix presentation and shape**: No activities or roles are missing or added. Row/column headings compliant.

- **No unwarranted content is present.**

**Summary**: The answer only deserves moderate credit. It observed the terminology policy and got the activities in the correct locations, but **missed correct RACI mappings almost everywhere**—a large conceptual flaw for a process-mapping consultant. If not for correct terminology and table structure, the score would be much lower.

**Final Score: 6.0**
