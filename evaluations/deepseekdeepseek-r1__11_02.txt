### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core structure (memo format, ≤200 words, focusing only on table activities) and identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), which is a strong match. Explanations are data-driven and table-strict, citing metrics like wait times (150min, 30min, 18min), processing times (25min, 12min), rework (22%, 5.3%), SLA breaches (12.4%, 3.2%), and throughput drops—mirroring the ground truth's emphasis without hallucinations or absent activities. Minor deductions for small inferences (e.g., LLM's "29% throughput drop" is accurate math from 270 to 190 but adds unprompted calculation; "3rd highest wait" is true but not in ground truth; "capacity strain" implies resourcing without explicit table evidence, unlike ground truth's neutral "upstream" framing).

However, significant point loss for divergent recommendations, a key task element (30% weight): LLM's are concrete but generic/basic (e.g., checklists, standardize templates, reallocate staff) versus ground truth's innovative, measurable ones (e.g., digital validation to "halve rework," AI triage with projected impacts). Structure differs (LLM's rigid 1-2-3 vs. ground truth's fluid narrative with bold metrics and overall projection), omitting the ground truth's end-to-end benefits summary (projected 10% throughput lift, 40% SLA reduction). These omissions and variances reduce precision, justifying strict deduction despite overall factual adherence. No guessing on ties, as numbers clearly differentiate hotspots.
