7.0

**Evaluation:**

- **Correct activities & ranking:** All three activities are correctly identified and ranked strictly by average waiting time: Request_Documents (#1), Send_Closure_Letter (#2), Assess_Liability (#3).
- **Quoted numbers:** The memo correctly quotes the average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each activity, matching the source table exactly.
- **No unrelated metrics:** Service time and executions are not discussed.
- **Action relevance & specificity:** The proposed actions, while plausible, are less precise, less operationally concrete, and lack the data-driven specificity or supporting details (pilot/tested numbers, targeted % reduction) that the ground-truth provides. For example:
    - For "Request_Documents," the ground truth specifies automated reminders and escalation with evidence for ≥25% reduction, while the LLM answer only suggests an "automated request tracker" without quantifying or justifying the expected reduction.
    - For "Send_Closure_Letter," the ground truth proposes replacing batch printing with instant digital letters for a 30% reduction, while the LLM suggests standard templating and automation without mentioning the batch-printing bottleneck or specifying the % reduction.
    - For "Assess_Liability," the ground truth recommends pre-classification to bypass queues with a 20–25% target, whereas the LLM suggests training adjusters to "frontload" work, a vaguer action.
- **Word count, structure, and compliance:** The memo is under 150 words and only discusses the target activities.

**Strict deductions:**  
- -1.0: Action recommendations not quantified (no % reduction evidence/target).
- -1.0: Action recommendations lack direct linkage to measured bottlenecks (less tailored than ground truth).
- -0.5: Wording on actions is less operational, less data-driven than requested.
- -0.5: Slightly generic phrasing ("expected to reduce..." vs specific targets).

**Total:** 7.0 (Good factual recall & scope, but falls short of the ground-truth's precision and data-driven detail, so strictness demands substantial penalty.)
