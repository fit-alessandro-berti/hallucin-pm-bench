### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but introduces several deviations that warrant significant deductions under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points Structure and Content (Major Deviation, -2.5 points)**: The ground truth uses a precise table with numbered entries focusing on "Branching logic / outcomes," explicitly detailing eligibility (proceed/reject), amount threshold (include/skip auditor), and final approval (approved/rejected). The LLM reframes this into 4 descriptive entries ("What is being decided") without numbering, omits explicit branching outcomes (e.g., no mention of rejection or process end), and treats activities like **Senior_Auditor_Review** as standalone decision points rather than integrating them into a "final payment approval" as in the ground truth. The high-value branch is listed separately but lacks the post-**Finance_Controller_PreApprove** timing specified in the ground truth. This adds interpretive fluff (e.g., "prepared from earlier validation artifacts") not in the process description or ground truth, violating the prompt's "Do not introduce... artefacts" indirectly.

- **Documents List (Minor but Cumulative Errors, -1.0 point)**: The complete list matches the ground truth's items (including conditional **AuditTrail**), but lacks numbering, the exact phrasing of the conditional note, and the critical parenthetical disclaimer ("No other documents or legacy activities..."). In the table, document assignments are partially interpretive (e.g., "Amount from the *RefundRequestForm*" isn't a "required document" per se but a trigger), and **BankTransferAuthorization** is noted correctly but not tied to constraints as precisely.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt (Factual Accuracy and Completeness, -0.3 point)**: The answer summarizes decision points and lists documents without introducing undefined activities (good), but misses the implicit decision in **Process_Refund_Payment** constraints (e.g., no payment without approvals, implied in ground truth #3). No legacy activity is mentioned, but the response is verbose and not as concise as the ground truth.

The answer is functionally correct on core elements (e.g., identifies triage, pre-approval, branch, and auditor) but loses points for structural mismatches, omitted outcomes, and minor additions that dilute precision. A perfect match would score 10.0; this is a solid but flawed approximation.
