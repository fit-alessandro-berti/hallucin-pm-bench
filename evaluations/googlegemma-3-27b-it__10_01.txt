6.0

**Justification and error analysis:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM completely avoids forbidden terms and uses the correct vocabulary throughout (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”) with exact spellings and capitalisation as required.
- No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced.
- Reasonable attempt at mapping roles and tasks.

**Significant Errors:**
1. **RACI misallocations (major):**
   - The LLM answers assign only “Responsible” and “Accountable” (for “Notify Customer”) marks. It omits *Consulted* and *Informed* assignments entirely, which are frequent in the ground truth. In particular:
       - Multiple “C” and “I” are missing (e.g., for “Receive Application”, the ground truth assigns C to CO, I to FC and IT; the LLM assigns nothing).
       - “Accountable” only appears for “Notify Customer,” whereas the ground truth frequently combines R/A (sometimes for the same role) and uses A for other steps.
   - The ground truth sometimes marks **both R and A for one role** (e.g., “R / A”), while the LLM never does.
   - For several activities (e.g., "KYC Review" and "Order Vetting"), the LLM assigns only “R” and leaves the rest blank versus the more nuanced RACI in the ground truth.
2. **Matrix completeness (major):**
   - Many cells are blank where the ground truth denotes specific RACI marks. A RACI matrix should be comprehensive.
   - The output does not reflect nuances in responsibility/accountability splits.
3. **Slight structural error (minor):**
   - The LLM puts only “R” or “A” in cells, never "R / A" or multiple codes as the ground truth does. While some matrices avoid slashes, here it is explicit and required.

**Summary:**
- The answer gets full points for terminology discipline, partial points for structuring the matrix, but loses heavily for missing “C” and “I” assignments and not matching the accountability/responsibility designations fully. 
- Due to these significant structural/informational misses (especially the lack of “C” and “I”), strict grading warrants a heavy penalty.

**Score deduction:**  
- -2 points for missing “C” and “I” throughout.
- -1.5 point for missing combined R/A designations.
- -0.5 for unnuanced accountability allocation.
- Some leniency is given for the attempt and formatting.

**Final: 6.0**
