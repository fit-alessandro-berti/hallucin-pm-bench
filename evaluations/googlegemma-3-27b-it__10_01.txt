The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with no forbidden terms appearing—this is a strong point but only covers the terminology aspect. However, the RACI matrix itself is severely incomplete and deviates significantly from the ground truth in several critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation:

- **RACI Assignments**: The matrix only assigns a single "R" (Responsible) per activity for most rows, omitting all "A" (Accountable), "C" (Consulted), and "I" (Informed) roles that are explicitly detailed in the ground truth. For example:
  - "Receive Application" lacks CO (C), FC (I), IT (I), and AM's dual R/A.
  - "KYC Review" misses AM (A), FC (C), IT (I).
  - Similar omissions across all rows, resulting in an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of responsibilities.
  - "Notify Customer" is a major error: it assigns only AM (A) with no "R" at all, while the ground truth has AM (R/A) and includes CO/FC/IT (I). This violates the rubric's requirement for exactly one "R" per activity and appropriate "A" for AM.
- **Format and Presentation**: Column headers use abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full role names (Account Manager, etc.) as in the ground truth. Activity names lack the bolding on mandated terms seen in the ground truth. The inclusion of an introductory title, explanatory text, and a full RACI key adds unwarranted content not present in the ground truth, inflating the response unnecessarily.
- **Overall Completeness**: While the core "R" assignments loosely align with the process narrative's handlers (e.g., AM for Receive Application), the lack of full RACI details (no consultations or informeds implied by typical process flows) makes it non-compliant with the ground truth's comprehensive structure. No extra tasks or roles are added, but the sparsity and errors in assignments dominate.

These differences—especially the incomplete RACI and missing secondary roles—represent fundamental failures in reflecting the expected full matrix, leading to substantial point deductions even for partial correctness on terminology.
