8.2

The LLM answer is clear, concise, and adheres closely to the prompt instructions and supplied data, but it does contain several notable deviations and minor issues compared to the ground truth answer, costing it significant points:

Strengths:
- Correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.
- Quantifies by how much each exceeds its SLA, and cites the relevant average waiting times using only data from the table.
- Uses bullet points only for recommendations, as instructed.
- Does not mention activities or metrics outside the supplied data.

Weaknesses:
1. **Action Recommendation Specificity**:  
   - The ground truth provides highly *data-driven and concrete* actions (e.g., "Introduce rule-based pre-checks so low-risk files bypass Legal Approval," "Add one risk analyst...and automate score retrieval," "Deploy a straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"), directly referencing staffing, automation, and loan amounts.  
   - The LLM's suggestions are more generic (e.g., "Conduct a root-cause analysis," "Prioritize automation or increase workforce"). These lack data-driven specificity and do not reference quantitative process levers or concrete thresholds from the data.

2. **Omission of Aggregate Context and Impact Assessment**:  
   - The ground truth memo cites the total case volume and projects potential impact (“reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35%”), providing a result-focused executive context.
   - The LLM memo omits these summary details, which are directly grounded in the table and valuable for executive communication.

3. **Memo Formatting and Tone**:  
   - The LLM's memo is less formal and less tailored to an executive audience as compared to the ground truth. The ground truth uses clear headings and attribution lines; the LLM uses a more casual closing (“Keep us updated”) not present in the ground truth.

4. **Use of Data in Recommendations**:  
   - The LLM’s solutions do not incorporate quantitative thresholds or bracketed process steps (e.g., no mention of €25k loans or specific staffing solutions), missing an opportunity to ground recommendations even further in the data.

Given these issues—especially the lack of specificity in the recommended actions and the omission of summarized impact—the answer loses substantial points from a perfect score, despite otherwise strong data fidelity and claim accuracy.

**Summary**:  
- Correct activity selection and quantification (+2)
- Accurate waiting time references (+2)
- Proper bullet point use (+1)
- No invented metrics/activities (+1)
- Generic, non-concrete recommendations (−2)
- Missing result/impact statement (−1)
- Missing case volume and context (−0.3)
- Slightly less formal tone (−0.5)
