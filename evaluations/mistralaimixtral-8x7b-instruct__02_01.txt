**4.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria Applied):
- **Format Deviation**: LLM adds explanatory prose ("Based on the provided...") before the JSON, violating "Return your answers in **exactly this JSON schema**". Ground truth is pure JSON. This is a clear non-compliance (-1.0 equivalent penalty).
- **Q1**: Exact match (3). +2.0
- **Q2**: Exact match ("Pack_Items"). +2.0
- **Q3**: Exact match ("2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00"). +2.0
- **Q4**: Exact match (2). +2.0
- **Q5**: Complete failure. Expected: `["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]` (activities never first in any case: firsts are Receive_Order for A/B, Quality_Check for C). LLM: `["Receive_Order"]` (wrong activity; it's the most common *first* event). No overlap, incorrect length/content. -2.0 (0 points).
- **Overall**: 8/10 content points possible for Qs, but strict deduction for Q5 error (major factual inaccuracy, misread cases/first events) and format yields 4.0. Minor log-reading skill shown in Q1-Q4 insufficient to offset critical flaws.
