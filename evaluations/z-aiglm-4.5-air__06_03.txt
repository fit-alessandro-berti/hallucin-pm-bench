9.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth. It correctly identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks in the correct order:

1. Quality_Check and Update_Inventory  
2. Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement

Points of minor deduction:

- The answer doesn't explicitly label the sets as "Set 1 – first parallel block" and "Set 2 – second parallel block" as in the ground truth; the use of "numbered and listed in order of appearance" is an acceptable paraphrase, but is not as precise as the ground truth.
- The LLM answer includes the phrase "These represent the two distinct parallel segments within the process," which is minor filler outside the asked-for structure.

However, the substance—identifying both sets correctly and not mentioning any other tasks or processes—is accurate. Therefore, a minor deduction results in a score of 9.0.
