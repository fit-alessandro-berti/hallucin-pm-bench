The LLM answer is an exact match in factual content and structure to the ground truth, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. For Q1-Q3, responses are precise and directly derived from the log. For Q4, the two reasons selected (small sample and temporal bias) are among the ground truth options, clearly stated, and aligned in detail without adding extraneous information. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., phrasing like "tiny sample" vs. "small sample size" or approximate time span) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they remain accurate and non-inferential.
