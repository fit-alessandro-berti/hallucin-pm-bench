The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can execute in parallel per Process B's description, in correct alphabetical order both within pairs and overall. Task names match precisely. The list format is nearly identical, with only a minor spacing discrepancy in the second pair (fewer leading spaces before the em dash, causing lack of visual alignment in monospace). However, the LLM adds an unrequested introductory sentence (with bolding), which deviates from the prompt's strict "Output one pair per line" instruction and the ground truth's structure (which has no intro but includes a rationale). Under utmost strictness, this extraneous text and spacing nit warrant a small but notable deduction from perfection; substance and compliance are otherwise exemplary.
