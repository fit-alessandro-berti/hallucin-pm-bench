The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides an accurate justification citing a valid counterexample (C003, lines 6-7), which alone disproves the "always" claim. However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it omits the second counterexample in C005 (lines 11-12), where *Validate_Payment* occurs without any preceding *Receive_Order*, a clear additional violation highlighted in the ground truth. This partial coverage represents a meaningful difference in thoroughness and citation of line numbers/case-IDs, warranting a deduction despite the overall logical correctness.
