7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the core changes: the three added tasks (Verify Identity/Task_VerifyIdentity, Request Additional Documents/Task_RequestDocs, Final Reject/Task_FinalReject), the one removed task (Reject Loan/Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change (Gateway_Decision from exclusive to inclusive). It structures the response under the exact required headings and appropriately ignores renamings (e.g., task/gateway names and the Approve Loan rename).

However, strict evaluation reveals significant flaws warranting deductions:
- **Added tasks (major error, -1.5 points)**: Includes accurate task IDs but adds unnecessary positional/descriptive details (e.g., "inserted between" or "new branch"), violating the concise summary intent. Critically, it mischaracterizes `Task_FinalReject` as a "replacement/repurposed" task for `Task_RejectLoan`, implying transformation rather than a pure additionâ€”this conflates added and removed categories and ignores BPMN semantics where IDs differ, making it a new element.
- **Removed tasks (moderate error, -0.5 points)**: Correctly lists the task but erroneously qualifies it as "replaced by `Task_FinalReject`," which incorrectly links it to an addition and deviates from a pure removal summary.
- **Gateway-type changes (minor errors, -0.5 points)**: Core change is accurate (exclusive to inclusive), with correct ignoring of name change. However, it adds extraneous explanation (e.g., "enabling parallel paths" and example of simultaneous conditions), which is interpretive and not required; also uses "Exclusive/Inclusive" without the ground truth's precise "XOR/OR" notation.
- **Overall structure and adherence (neutral, no deduction)**: Uses bold headings matching the prompt, but formatting (e.g., bullets vs. numbered list, added note) slightly deviates from ground truth conciseness without affecting correctness.

Total deductions from 10.0 reflect utmost strictness: core elements match (75% alignment), but descriptive inaccuracies and extras introduce meaningful differences in precision and fidelity to a "strict" summary. No other changes (e.g., flows) are invented or omitted.
