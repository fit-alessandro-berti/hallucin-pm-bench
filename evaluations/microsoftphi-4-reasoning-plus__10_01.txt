2.5

The LLM answer partially identifies the core process steps and correctly renames them to adhere to the vocabulary policy in the main table (using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as required). However, it severely underperforms in several critical areas, leading to a low score under strict evaluation:

- **Vocabulary policy violation (-2.0 points)**: The policy is explicit and STRICT—do not mention forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") even in quotes, brackets, or notes. The LLM answer repeatedly references them in explanatory notes (e.g., "formerly “Customer Due Diligence”", "instead of “Order Validation”", "instead of “Payment Processing”"), directly breaching this rule. This is a fundamental failure, as the policy supersedes all else and invalidates any "contextual" intent.

- **RACI matrix incompleteness and inaccuracy (-3.5 points)**: The ground truth provides a full RACI implementation with precise assignments (e.g., R/A for combined responsible/accountable roles, C for consulted, I for informed across multiple roles, reflecting cross-functional involvement in an order-to-cash workflow). The LLM assigns only a simplistic "R" to the single primary role per activity (based solely on "handled by" phrasing), leaving all other cells as "–" or blank. This ignores the RACI framework's requirements for A (accountability), C (consultation), and I (information flow), resulting in a matrix that does not "reflect the narrative" of potential inter-role dependencies (e.g., no C for CO in Order Vetting or I for others). It is essentially a basic responsibility chart, not a true RACI matrix. Every row differs substantially from the ground truth.

- **Format and extraneous content (-1.5 points)**: The response is bloated with irrelevant internal reasoning (thousands of words of rambling monologue about decision-making, unrelated to output), which dilutes the directness expected. The table uses inconsistent formatting (e.g., numbers in rows, "–" placeholders instead of blanks or N/A, no bolding for emphasis as in ground truth). Notes introduce unwarranted content (e.g., restating process descriptions, explanations of letters), violating the rubric's "no extra tasks, roles, or columns." The ground truth is concise, table-focused, and rubric-aligned.

- **Minor positives (+0.5 points)**: Basic structure (activities as rows, roles as columns) is followed, and primary "R" assignments align directionally with who "handles" each step. No new activities or roles are invented.

Overall, the differences are profound: the output is neither a complete nor policy-compliant RACI matrix, failing the core task despite superficial accuracy in renaming. This warrants a failing-grade equivalent under utmost strictness.
