4.5

The LLM answer demonstrates understanding of the required vocabulary substitutions (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”) and does not use any forbidden terms. However, significant issues reduce its score:

**Strengths:**
- Correct use of preferred vocabulary—no forbidden terms appear, and all replacements are spelled and capitalized as required.
- The process steps and roles are all represented, mapped 1:1.
- The answer presents a matrix in the correct structural format: activities as rows, roles as columns.

**Major Issues:**
1. **RACI Assignment Incorrect and Incomplete:**
   - The answer only assigns an “R” (Responsible) to the person performing the work in each activity, and leaves other roles blank. There is never an “A”, “C”, or “I” assignment anywhere.
   - The ground truth shows, for example:
     - Receive Application: AM is R/A, CO is C, FC/IT are I.
     - KYC Review: CO is R, AM is A, FC is C, IT is I.
   - The LLM answer completely omits *Accountable*, *Consulted*, *Informed* roles in every activity, and fails to mark cases of dual R/A.
   - Only a rudimentary "who does the step" mapping is presented—in RACI terms, this is a draft at best, not a full matrix.

2. **No R/A Markings Where Required:**
   - In the ground truth, Account Manager is both R and A for multiple steps; LLM never inserts more than one letter per cell.

3. **No Consulted or Informed Parties:**
   - The ground truth explicitly lists C and I roles for almost every activity; the LLM answer ignores these dimensions entirely.

4. **Excessive and Unnecessary Explanation:**
   - The answer includes a very lengthy reasoning chain and prototype matrices, which detracts from clarity and conciseness—though this isn’t scored strictly, it demonstrates lack of focus.

**Minor Issues:**
- The answer’s table format is acceptable, but doesn’t visually differentiate R, A, C, I the way the ground truth does (e.g., boldface or R/A dual markers).

**Summary:**
- Adherence to vocabulary: full points.
- Completeness and correctness of RACI mapping: large deduction (over half-points lost).
- No forbidden content: no deduction.
- Proper structure: partial credit.

**Final score: 4.5**—harsh penalization is merited for omitting “Accountable”, “Consulted”, and “Informed” columns, despite correct activity/role pairings and vocabulary.
