The LLM answer correctly identifies that the cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps and durations, aligning with the ground truth's core reasoning. However, it deviates by using a multi-part structure (initial statement, bolded "Reason" with two sentences, and an unrequested explanatory note), violating the prompt's instruction for "one concise sentence," which results in a significant deduction for lack of strict adherence to format and conciseness; minor wording differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute") further reduce precision.
