- The LLM answer has the correct content: it lists all added and removed tasks and both gateway type changes precisely.
- Format issues: The LLM answer does not reproduce the specified headings verbatim (it uses hyphens and additional spacing).
- It also adds hyphens before each task and gateway, while the ground truth uses bullet points only for tasks and aligns colons for gateways.
- The order and wording for the headings are not strictly as in the ground truth ("ADDED TASKS", etc.), especially with additional hyphens and inconsistent formatting. No extra commentary is present, so no penalty there.
- Overall, these deviations from the given output format specification are significant and warrant a substantial deduction, though the content is otherwise correct.
