The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, correctly identifying all added tasks, the removed task, and the two gateway changes with precise IDs, names, and type transitions. However, it deducts a full point due to strict formatting deviations: leading hyphens ("-") before each heading (violating "verbatim" requirement for headings), inconsistent indentation/spacing under headings, and lack of alignment spaces in the second gateway entry (e.g., no spaces after the colon in "Gateway_Payment" to match ground truth's columnar alignment). These are small but verifiable textual differences that impact exactness under utmost strictness.
