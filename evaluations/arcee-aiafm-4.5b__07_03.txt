2.5

The LLM answer is substantially incomplete and deviates from the required format and content. It misses two added tasks (Task_FastTrackApproval and Task_NotifyCustomer), omits one gateway change (Gateway_Payment), and uses incorrect formatting throughout (e.g., backticks, colons instead of parentheses for task names, no names in removed tasks, markdown headings). These errors violate the prompt's strict requirements for verifiable differences only, exact formatting, and completeness, warranting a low score under utmost strictness.
