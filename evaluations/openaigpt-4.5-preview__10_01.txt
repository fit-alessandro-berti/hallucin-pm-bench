6.0

**Analysis:**

**Correct use of vocabulary (critical for this prompt):**
- The model correctly uses the required terms (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”) and does *not* mention the forbidden terms. Full points here.

**Structure:**
- Presents activities as rows and roles as columns, as requested.
- However, the role headers (AM, CO, FC, IT) are abbreviated rather than spelled out. Minor deduction (~0.5).

**RACI assignments:**
- The answer only fills **Responsible** roles (“R”) and leaves the rest blank; however, the ground truth provides a full RACI mapping (**R/A**, A, C, I for each activity and each role).
- This is a *major* omission, resulting in substantial loss of points. The table therefore does not reflect the full complexity and allocation of responsibility as shown in the ground truth.
- No activities show “Accountable”, “Consulted”, or “Informed” in any cell, except for a disclaimer/explanatory note beneath the table. This is not acceptable for strict mapping.
- The matrix *should* reflect: Account Manager as R/A for certain tasks, C/I/etc. for other roles and tasks, as per ground truth.

**Extra content / Self-awareness:**
- Adds a legend and a disclaimer about the lack of explicit A/C/I assignments — this is unwarranted and should not compensate for simply not providing those assignments.

**Summary:**
- Correct vocabulary and activities.
- Partial data (only “Responsible” filled) is a serious failing for a RACI request, causing loss of at least 3–4 points.
- Incorrect column headers (abbreviated).
- No unwarranted process steps or roles.

**Conclusion:**  
6.0 — Vocabulary and process steps are correct, but the lack of accountabilities/consulted/informed in the RACI table itself constitutes a major flaw per “utmost strictness”.
