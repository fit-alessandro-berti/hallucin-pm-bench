### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Compliance (Perfect - 10/10)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere. This matches the ground truth fully.
  
- **Core Structure and Content (Partial - 5/10)**: 
  - Activities as rows and roles as columns: Matches.
  - Activities listed: Identical to ground truth.
  - Responsible (R) assignments: Accurately reflect the narrative's performers (e.g., R for AM on Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer; R for CO on KYC Review, etc.). Each activity has exactly one R, aligning with the process description.
  - However, significant incompleteness: The LLM provides only R assignments, ignoring Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) roles, which are fully detailed in the ground truth (e.g., AM as R/A on multiple steps, CO as C on several, widespread I's). The prompt requests a "RACI matrix," implying all elements, but the LLM explicitly notes the gaps without filling them, creating a half-complete matrix. This is a major deviation, as the ground truth infers a logical full RACI based on typical workflow accountability (e.g., AM as A where appropriate).
  - Role columns: Uses abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full names (Account Manager, etc.), differing from ground truth. The prompt lists both, but ground truth uses full for clarity— a minor formatting error, but strictness demands deduction.
  - No bolding or emphasis on R's as in ground truth.

- **Unwarranted Content (Partial - 4/10)**: No extra tasks or roles introduced, which is good. However, the added "Legend" and "Note" (explaining lack of A/C/I and offering updates) are extraneous explanations not present in the ground truth. The notes for the judge rubric specify "No extra tasks, roles, or columns," but this interpretive content adds unsolicited commentary, violating a clean, direct response. It acknowledges incompleteness but doesn't resolve it.

- **Overall Correctness and Fidelity (Weighted Average)**: Strong on basics (terms, R's), but fails to deliver a complete RACI, introduces minor structural/formatting mismatches, and adds unnecessary text. Per strict rubric, these differences (especially missing A/C/I and accountability inferences) result in substantial point loss. The answer is functional but not equivalent to the comprehensive ground truth—more like a simplified responsibility chart than a full RACI. Total reflects ~55% alignment.
