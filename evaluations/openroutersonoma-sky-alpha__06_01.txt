The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, pairs, ordering (alphabetical within pairs and overall), and task names. The minor formatting difference in spacing (non-alignment of the em dash) does not constitute an error, as the specified output format does not require alignment, only the pattern `Task_X  â€”  Task_Y`. No deductions apply under strict evaluation.
