The LLM answer correctly identified both applicable pairs and listed them in the correct alphabetical order in the list. However, it lost points for the following reasons:

- It did not strictly follow the required format regarding intra-pair alphabetical alignment:  
  The second pair was written as `Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`
  whereas the ground truth had two spaces before the em dash:  
  `Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines`

- The answer omitted the required code block formatting (the ground truth put the pairs in a code block).

- Although the intra-pair ordering is correct for both pairs (alphabetical within each pair), and the overall list order is correct, very small formatting mismatches (space alignment, code block) per the instruction for utmost strictness, cost the answer 2 points.

If not for the minor formatting/whitespace/code block differences, this would be a perfect answer.
