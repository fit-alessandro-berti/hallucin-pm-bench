**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match in intent, accuracy, and adherence to the system instruction, directly addressing both numbered questions with precise language from the context (e.g., "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted"). It correctly rejects derivation, explains the absence of temporal data, notes the benchmark's inapplicability, and avoids fabrication. Phrasing differences from ground truth (e.g., "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; explicit benchmark reference) are stylistic and enhance clarity without errors. Ground truth's mention of lacking "ordering information" is arguably less precise, as sequential rows imply order per case. No deductions warranted under strict evaluation.
