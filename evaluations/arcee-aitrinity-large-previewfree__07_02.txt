### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Content Accuracy (10/10)**: 
- Added tasks: Exactly matches GT (3 correct tasks: Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject; correct names).
- Removed tasks: Exactly matches (1 correct: Task_RejectLoan).
- Gateway-type changes: Core change correct (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision). No misses or extras in elements identified.

**Penalties for Differences (Total -0.8)**:
- **Formatting/Style (-0.3)**: Bulleted lists (-) vs GT numbered (1., 2.); headings use • **Heading**: (with colon/bold) vs GT * **Heading** (no colon). Minor but strict deduction.
- **Presentation Order (-0.3)**: Consistent swap—ID first `(name)` vs GT name first bolded with `ID` backticks (affects all items).
- **Gateway Wording (-0.2)**: Includes cosmetic name change ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check"), violating "ignore cosmetic renamings." Lacks GT's semantic descriptors (XOR/OR, *v1*/*v2* italics). Precise but overly XML-literal and includes ignored detail.

No other errors (e.g., no hallucinated changes, ignores renamings correctly elsewhere like Task_ApproveLoan). Semantically near-identical; deductions only for strict GT mismatches.
