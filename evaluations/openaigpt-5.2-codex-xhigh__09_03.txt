The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in substance, structure (one short paragraph), and precision: both correctly identify the absence of event rows, timestamps (start_time/complete_time), and data for "Approve Invoice"; both note the SLA's irrelevance; both explain why metrics (average, std dev, 95% CI) cannot be computed. Minor deductions for stylistic differences—e.g., ground truth's emphatic "Impossible —" opener and explicit "dispersion" phrasing vs. LLM's "I cannot compute" and "number of occurrences" addition (accurate but not verbatim)—and omission of "additional raw log entries are required," per utmost strictness on even small variances.
