**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Major structural differences (-3.0)**: LLM uses "Process Step" column with RACI as separate columns (full role names in cells). Ground truth uses tasks as rows, roles (including undefined "Operations Manager") as columns, RACI letters in cells with legend. This is a fundamental format mismatch.
- **Role differences (-2.0)**: LLM correctly limits to mandated terms + source "IT Support" (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support). Ground truth invents "Operations Manager" (absent from prompt/source), but LLM omits it entirely—no match.
- **Task coverage/granularity differences (-1.5)**: LLM splits into 8 granular rows (e.g., separate "Releases the payment", "Ensures SWIFT message is sent", "Notifies Regulatory Liaison"), covering source explicitly. Ground truth condenses to 6 rows, omits explicit SWIFT/notify (implicitly folds into others). Task names also differ (verbose vs. short, e.g., "Receives the customer’s transfer instruction and logs it in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction").
- **RACI assignments mismatch (-1.5)**: No row fully matches. Partial overlaps (e.g., KYC "Responsible" both Regulatory Liaison; Screen partial R on Transaction Analyst), but Accountable/Consulted/Informed differ systematically (e.g., ground truth overloads "A" on Operations Manager; LLM often self-accountable).
- **Extra content (-0.5)**: LLM adds title, "Enforced Vocabulary Used" list, notes—unrequested bloat. Ground truth is minimal table + legend + short note.
- **Vocabulary compliance (neutral/+0.5 partial)**: Both use mandated terms perfectly ("KYC Review", etc.), but doesn't offset other failures.
- **Markdown table (neutral)**: Both valid, but LLM's dashes ("—") and bolds are stylistic extras vs. ground truth's clean letters.

Total penalized heavily per "utmost strictness" and "small errors significant loss"—LLM captures spirit/source fidelity better than flawed ground truth but differs too much in form/content for higher score. Perfect match required for 10.0.
