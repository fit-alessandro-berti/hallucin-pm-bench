The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the accurate minimal sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) for Q2, matching the ground truth's core conclusion and demonstration. However, deductions for: (1) confusing inaccuracies in reasoning (e.g., Step 2 erroneously suggests T3 requires T2/T7, when T3 only needs P2); (2) failure to include markings (M1–M5) or the post-T5 disablement of T3, which ground truth uses for confirmation; (3) exceeding the ≤120-word limit (LLM's steps total ~180 words); (4) incomplete final presentation (sequences the boxed "Yes" but omits Q2 details in the box and lacks Q1/Q2 headers). These format/explanation differences warrant a strict penalty despite factual alignment.
