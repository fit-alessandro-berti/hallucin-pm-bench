**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Structural differences (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: LLM has 8 rows and 3 roles (Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst, IT Support); GT has 6 rows and 4 roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support). Missing Operations Manager column; extra rows (e.g., separate "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison"); different column order.
- **Task wording differences (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: LLM tasks are longer/more source-faithful but not matching GT's shortened phrasing (e.g., "Receive customer’s transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**"; extra tasks not in GT). Omits GT's exact headers like "Task / Activity (mandated wording)".
- **RACI assignments mismatch (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: Almost no full row matches. Partial overlaps (e.g., Transaction Analyst R on receive/screen/release; Regulatory Liaison R on KYC), but GT adds C/I/A across roles per task. LLM lacks A for most tasks (poor RACI practice), uses A only for approve (vs. GT's R); no C used despite Key listing it; empties many cells vs. GT's full coverage.
- **Minor formatting/legend differences (deduction: -0.5 points)**: "Key" vs. "Legend"; includes unused C; no bolds on cells/tasks like GT; different phrasing.
- **Vocabulary compliance (neutral, minor positive but no gain vs. GT)**: Both use mandated terms correctly (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst) + IT Support from source; LLM avoids extras like GT's unmandated "Operations Manager".

Total matches ~25% (some roles/tasks/assignments); overwhelming differences justify low score under "utmost strictness" – equivalent to major errors/omissions/substitutions. Perfect match would be 10.0; this fails on core table fidelity.
