The LLM answer correctly identifies the factual changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), but it fails significantly in adherence to the prompt's requirement to "use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML." The XML specifies names via the `name` attribute (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" for id="check_vip"), yet the LLM uses only IDs without the exact names, omitting critical descriptive content present in the ground truth. This is compounded by minor formatting deviations (e.g., "-" bullets vs. "*" bullets; less verbose gateway description without version references) and lack of the clarifying parenthetical IDs in added/removed sections, resulting in a substantially incomplete match under strict evaluation.
