8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Accuracy (High)**: The LLM correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the ground truth in content, order, and conclusion that no other tasks are concurrent. No factual errors or omissions regarding the tasks or parallel constructs.
- **Differences Impacting Score (Moderate Deduction)**: 
  - Formatting variances: Ground truth uses a concise inline format with "â€–" symbol for parallelism; LLM uses bullet points and descriptive labels (e.g., "(after Parallel Split #1)" vs. "first parallel block"), which adds slight stylistic divergence.
  - Unnecessary additions: LLM includes an introductory sentence and a detailed "Explanation" section elaborating on independence and merges, which is not present in the ground truth. This verbosity introduces differences beyond the prompt's request to "list each set," warranting a deduction for exceeding the concise structure (strictness applied: ~1.5-point loss).
- Overall: Excellent fidelity to the required information, but penalized for presentation and extraneous details under utmost strictness.
