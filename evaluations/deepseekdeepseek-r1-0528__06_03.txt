The LLM answer is clear, accurate, and closely matches the ground truth. It correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks, numbers them in order, and uses the expected task names. The lists are formatted and match the intended logic (sets after Parallel Split #1 and #2). 

The only places of (very minimal) deviation:
- The LLM includes brief explanations beneath the list, even though the prompt only asks for the sets and a single sentence: "give no information about Processes A or C." While there is no mention of A or C, the explanations are arguably "extra information," which technically is more than strictly required. This reflects a very minor instructions compliance miss.
- The set labels are slightly expanded ("Set 1 (after Parallel Split #1)" vs "Set 1 â€“ first parallel block"), but this does not meaningfully affect the content.

Given the requirement for utmost strictness, even this tiny addition of explanation (which was not requested) should reflect as a full point deduction. Otherwise, from a content and correctness standpoint, the answer is perfect.

**Strict assessment: 9.0**
