The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses the violation in Rule 3 while satisfying Rules 1, 2, and 4, with reasoning that closely aligns with the ground truth in substance. However, under strict evaluation, it loses points for: (1) incomplete justification of Rule 1, omitting explicit reference to QE and RA occurring "once each" (as stated in the rule and ground truth); (2) differing format (bullets instead of a structured table with assessment symbols like ✔/❌, which the ground truth uses for clarity); and (3) lacking an explicit overall summary statement tying the violation to non-compliance (present in ground truth). These are small but notable differences in completeness and presentation.
