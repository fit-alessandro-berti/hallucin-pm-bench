The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in both its conclusion ("No") and its justifications, referencing each rule with relevant reasoning. It correctly identifies rule 3 as violated due to the premature occurrence of `Notify_Authorities` before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`. For rules 1, 2, and 4, it provides accurate and parallel justifications, labeling them satisfied and explaining why.

However, the LLM answer includes a minor presentational difference by not giving a summary sentence stating "Because rule 3 is violated, the overall trace is non-compliant," as in the gold standard. It also lacks the tabular format of the ground truth and uses phraseology slightly less explicit for the final compliance determination. These are small stylistic/formatting omissions, but content-wise the LLM answer is entirely accurate.

Given the instruction to penalize even small differences, I deduct 1 point for these presentational and explicative omissions.
