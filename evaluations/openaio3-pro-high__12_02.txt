10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and accuracy: it correctly starts with "No", provides justification in one concise paragraph, cites the exact same line numbers (6, 7, 11) and case-ids (C003, C005), and identifies the precise counterexamples (order reversal in C003 and absence of Receive_Order in C005) that disprove the "always follows" claim. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "so it does not “follow” it" vs. "only afterwards"; "these two counter-examples show" vs. "these instances prove") do not alter the factual correctness or fidelity to the prompt's requirements, warranting full marks under even strict evaluation.
