The LLM answer is completely correct and matches the ground truth answer with no errors or omissions:

- Q1: Correctly identifies "3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003)". Matches A1 exactly.
- Q2: Correct sequence for C002, using the correct separator and order: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order. Matches A2 exactly.
- Q3: Correctly finds "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" as the only activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order", alphabetically ordered, one per line. Matches A3 exactly.

Formatting is appropriate, and there are no hallucinations or missing elements.
