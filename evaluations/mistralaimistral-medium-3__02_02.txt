The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, with exact matches on factual content for all questions (Q1 correctly identifies 3 cases; Q2 sequence is identical; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities alphabetically and one per line). Minor deductions for: (1) extraneous details in Q1 (listing case names, unasked for in ground truth's concise "3"); (2) verbose explanatory text throughout, diverging from ground truth's succinct format; (3) Q3 formatting lacks the bullet-style dashes present in ground truth, though it adheres to "one per line." No hallucinations or factual errors.
