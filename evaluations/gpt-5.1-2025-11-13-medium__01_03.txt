7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 5.0/10)**: The ground truth identifies exactly two decision points (the risk-based skip conditional branch and the TriVote gate), each summarized concisely in one sentence with precise rules matching the process description. The LLM correctly identifies and describes these two in accurate detail (minor wording variations like "skips" vs. "bypasses" or "approve" vs. "record 'Approve'" are negligible). However, under utmost strictness, the LLM commits significant errors by adding two extraneous "decision points": (1) misclassifying the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3) itself as a decision point/gate, when it is merely an input-generating step preceding the actual branch (not a conditional or gate per the prompt's criteria); (2) fabricating an "Applicant confirmation gate" (Step 8) as a decision point, which the ground truth and process description do not treat as such (it is a procedural request step without an explicit conditional rule or "gate" label). These additions introduce unrequested content, inflate the count from 2 to 4, and deviate from the ground truth's scope, warranting a major deduction (halving the score for this section due to hallucinated structure and over-inclusion).
  
- **Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 10.0/10)**: Exact match to the ground truth in content, order, and completeness. No additions, omissions, or hallucinations (e.g., no erroneous KYC/AML/credit-bureau mentions).

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Factored In)**: The LLM's response is well-formatted and adheres to the prompt's requirements for summarization and listing, with no violations of process notes (e.g., no invented external checks). However, the extraneous content in (a) creates substantive differences from the ground truth, preventing a higher score despite strong accuracy on the core elements. Weighted average yields 7.0, reflecting strict penalization for additions as "significant differences" per the evaluation criteria.
