**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in nearly every aspect, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Columns/roles**: LLM uses 3 roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support); ground truth uses 4, including "Operations Manager" (completely absent in LLM).
- **Number and phrasing of tasks**: LLM has 8 rows with source-close but non-matching phrasings (e.g., "Receive transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; adds unmatching "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison after archiving"); ground truth has exactly 6 specific phrasings, omitting/explicitly differing on SWIFT/notify/archive details.
- **RACI assignments**: No row fully matches; all cells differ (e.g., Receive: LLM "R/A/I/I" vs. "R/I/A/C"; KYC: partial overlap but shifted; new rows have no counterpart).
- **Format/details**: LLM combines "R/A" (non-standard vs. ground truth's separate **R**/**A**); no "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header, no Legend, no post-table notes; intro text present but mismatched.
- **Coverage**: LLM splits/expands source (over-coverage); ignores ground truth's exact task consolidation and Operations Manager accountabilities.

Even mandated vocab use (e.g., "KYC Review", roles) provides no offset, as structure/content/assignments are fundamentally divergent—small phrasing/notation errors alone would deduct heavily, compounded by wholesale mismatches.
