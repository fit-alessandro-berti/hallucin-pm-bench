The LLM answer is factually perfect, correctly identifies both counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), and directly negates the "always" claim with precise citations matching the log and ground truth. It adheres to the prompt's structure ("No" first, then one-paragraph justification). Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "occurring before ... line 6 then line 7" vs. "occurs first ... only afterwards"; "without any Receive_Order in the fragment" vs. "never contains ... at all"; no explicit "claim is false because clear counter-examples" lead-in; heavier use of bolding vs. italics) and lacking the concluding summary sentence, per utmost strictness on any non-verbatim divergence from ground truth.
