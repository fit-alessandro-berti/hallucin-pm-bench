8.0

The LLM answer is largely correct and provides a valid firing sequence (T1, T2, T5), including a brief but accurate justification of T5's enabling condition. However, compared to the ground truth:

- The LLM stops at firing T5, whereas the ground truth continues to show that after T5, T3 and then T4 may still fire, giving a more complete reachable path.
- The LLM omits the observation that after T3 fires, T5 becomes permanently disabled—an important logical argument explicitly spelled out in the ground truth.
- The LLM neglects the possibility "T5 must fire before T3 if ever to fire"—this is subtly stated in ground truth but not in LLM's answer.
- The LLM fails to mention the changes to the enabling/disabling of transitions post-T3, which provides a stronger proof in the ground truth.

While the LLM answer is correct and mostly well-justified, it lacks the exhaustive analysis and rigor required for full marks, particularly in ruling out any possibility for T5 to fire after T3, and omits some steps shown in the ground truth answer. Thus, a score of 8.0 reflects these deficiencies.
