The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3 (yes), provides a valid and minimal concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) from the initial marking that demonstrates this, and offers a brief, accurate justification focused on the enabling conditions (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0 via inhibitor arc). This directly addresses the prompt without extraneous details.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for strictness: 
- The sequence omits explicit post-T5 markings (e.g., p3 → 0, p6 → 1), which are implied but not as precisely detailed as in the ground truth.
- The justification is correct but lacks the ground truth's deeper insight into why T5 *must* precede T3 (permanent disablement post-T3), though this is not required by the prompt and the LLM's response remains fully sufficient and error-free for the asked question.
