3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the core requirements but exhibits significant deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Roles**: The LLM uses only three roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting the critical "Operations Manager" role present in the ground truth. This incomplete role set fails to map the full accountability structure implied in the RACI framework (major deduction: -3.0 points).

- **Task Wording and Structure**: Tasks retain informal, numbered phrasing from the source (e.g., "1. Receive transfer instruction & log in system"), rather than the clean, mandated, bolded titles in the ground truth (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "**KYC Review**"). The LLM splits task 5 into two rows ("Release the payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message sent"), creating redundancy and disorganization, while the ground truth consolidates logically. Task 6 is phrased as "Archive case file" instead of "Archive Record". No header like "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" or bolding for key terms (e.g., no **KYC Review** emphasis). These formatting and precision errors compound across all six tasks (major deduction: -2.5 points).

- **RACI Assignments**: Assignments differ substantially in every row, often simplifying or omitting entries:
  - Task 1: LLM assigns only R to Analyst; ground truth adds I (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), C (IT Support).
  - Task 2: LLM only R to Analyst; ground truth adds A (Liaison), I (Operations Manager), C (IT Support).
  - Task 3: LLM A/R to Liaison; ground truth C (Analyst), R (Liaison), A (Operations Manager), I (IT Support).
  - Task 4: LLM A/R to Liaison; ground truth mirrors task 3 but LLM misses C/A/I.
  - Task 5 (Release): LLM R (Analyst), C (IT Support); ground truth adds I (Liaison), A (Operations Manager). The separate SWIFT row in LLM has no equivalent in ground truth.
  - Task 6: LLM R (IT Support), I (Liaison); ground truth adds C (Analyst), A (Operations Manager).
  These inaccuracies indicate incomplete mapping of responsibilities, consultations, and accountabilities from the source text (major deduction: -3.5 points, as this is the core of a RACI table).

- **Additional Elements**: No legend/explanation (present in ground truth). Introductory text ("Here's the RACI table...") is extraneous. While the LLM correctly uses mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions, this is a minimal positive offset (+1.0 point for partial compliance). No omissions of source steps, but the overall table does not "organise the RACI matrix clearly" as required.

Total: Starting from 10.0, deductions total -9.0 for systemic failures in fidelity to ground truth, resulting in 3.0. The answer is functional as a basic table but unacceptably divergent in structure, completeness, and accuracy.
