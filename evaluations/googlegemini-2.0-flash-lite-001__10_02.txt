5.0

**Evaluation:**

**Vocabulary Compliance:**
- The LLM answer strictly uses "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst": **+0**
- However, it failed to include "Operations Manager", which is in the ground truth as the Accountable (A) actor for several tasks. This is a notable omission. **-1.0**

**Task Naming:**
- Several tasks are worded too closely to the informal text instead of mapping to the mandated vocabulary or normalized process activity (e.g., "Receive transfer instruction & log in system" vs "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs "Screen Against Sanctions List").
- The LLM merges two activities in task 1, and does not consistently use the mandated or normalized wording from ground truth. **-0.5**

**RACI Assignments:**
- Accountable (A) is almost never assigned to any party except "Regulatory Liaison" for tasks 3 and 4; in ground truth, "Operations Manager" (missing) is generally Accountable for all tasks. **-1.5**
- There are missing Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments for several activities compared to the ground truth, e.g., the Transaction Analyst is not marked C for "KYC Review", nor IT Support as C in several steps. **-1.0**

**Incomplete Stakeholder Mapping:**
- "IT Support" is included (good), but roles like "Operations Manager" are omitted, resulting in tasks missing their full RACI evaluation. **-1.0**

**Legend Omission:**
- The LLM answer does not provide a legend for the RACI letters, while the ground truth does. **-0.5**

**Other:**
- Some wording errors (e.g., task split/lumping, double listing task 5) reflect sloppiness. **-0.5**

**Summary:**
The answer demonstrates a rough understanding of the instructions and makes an effort to use the mandated vocabulary, but there are numerous and significant deviations:
- Missing required roles (Operations Manager)
- Incorrect or incomplete RACI assignments
- Task description inconsistencies
- Legend omission

Despite some strengths (mandated synonyms upheld, no forbidden terms used, all source steps addressed), the numerous small and moderate errors accumulate. Score: **5.0**.
