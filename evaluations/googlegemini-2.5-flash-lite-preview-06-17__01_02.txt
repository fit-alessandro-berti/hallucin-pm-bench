5.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major deficiencies, ~40% of score impact)**: The LLM correctly identifies two decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) but describes them incompletely—omitting key process context like "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for the first and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for the second. Critically, it entirely misses the third decision point (Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)), which is a core branch with approve/reject outcomes. This omission violates the prompt's call to "summarise the decision points" comprehensively, leading to a significant penalty under strict evaluation.
  
- **Required Documents (minor issues, ~60% of score impact)**: The list is complete and uses exact terminology, matching all six items. However, small phrasing errors deduct points: "≤ 3 months old" (vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"); "(CIS) template" (vs. "(CIS)"). The ground truth's parenthetical note on excluded documents is absent, though not explicitly required. Bullet format vs. numbering is stylistic but acceptable.

Overall, the response is partially accurate but critically incomplete on decision points, justifying a mid-range score with deductions for precision and omissions.
