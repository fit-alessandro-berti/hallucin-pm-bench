6.0

**Analysis:**

**Positives:**  
- The LLM answer correctly lists all required documents using exact names, matching both content and order.
- The Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision are mentioned as decision points, using proper process terminology.
- The prompt to use process-specific terminology and not standard loan language is followed.

**Negatives:**  
- **Omission of Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as Decision Point:** The LLM answer fails to mention this critical, explicit decision point. It's clear in the ground truth that this is a decision node where the board votes to approve or reject loans ≥ €15,000.
- **Missing Sequences/Ordering:** The LLM does not specify that the Amount Threshold Decision comes after Neighbourhood Feedback Check, nor does it clarify decision pathways fully.
- **Brevity/Omissions in Process Logic:** The answer does not explicitly state decision path branches or consequences (e.g., what happens after escalation at the Underwriter Alignment Gate, or the specific routing upon Amount Threshold Decision).
- **Documents:** The document list is almost perfect, but CIS is called "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" rather than just "Community Impact Statement (CIS)".

**Strictness Justification:**  
- **Severe error**: Not listing the “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)” as a decision point is a significant oversight (about -2 points).
- **Moderate errors**: Not explicitly outlining where each decision point sits in the flow, especially with respect to subsequent actions or escalation paths (about -1 point).
- **Minor nomenclature error**: The word "template" is extraneous in the CIS document (“(CIS) template” versus just “(CIS)”), losing another small fraction of a point.
- **Contextual completeness**: Fewer specifics provided in process branches and precise step location as in the ground truth, losing another -0.5 point.

Thus, with these strict criteria, the answer rates as a **6.0**. The core information is present, but the omission of a major decision point and the lack of specific branching/logical detail (expected in an “expert” context) require significant point deductions.
