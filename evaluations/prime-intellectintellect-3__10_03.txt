**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses **exactly** the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. No violations here.
- **Table Structure (Major Failure, -3.0)**: Fundamentally incorrect format. Uses "classic" RACI (Activity | R | A | C | I columns with single roles) instead of ground truth's **roles-as-columns, activities-as-rows** with multi-RACI cells (e.g., **R, A**), dashes (–), and populated C/I. Empty cells abound; ignores nuanced multi-role involvement.
- **Activities (Major Failure, -2.5)**: Adds unauthorized/extra activities ("Approval", "Scheduling the payment", "Releasing the funds", "Notifying the originating analyst") mismatching ground truth ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"). Violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities." Covers narrative but incorrectly fragments/renames (e.g., no "Scheduling"; notification merged/absent).
- **RACI Assignments (Total Failure, -2.5)**: Assignments bear **no resemblance** to ground truth. Examples:
  | Activity | LLM Errors |
  |----------|------------|
  | Intake Vetting | R,A only Front-Office Analyst (misses C: Compliance Analyst, I: Treasury Ops). |
  | KYC Review | R,A only Compliance Analyst (misses C: Compliance Officer, I: Treasury Ops). |
  | AML Screening | Same as above (identical error). |
  | Risk Scoring | R,A Compliance Analyst (wrong; ground truth: C Front-Office, R Compliance Analyst, **A** Compliance Officer, I Treasury). |
  | Others | Fabricated/wrong (e.g., no conditional escalation logic reflected). |
  Ignores all C/I except one trivial I.
- **Completeness/Coverage (Failure, -1.0)**: Fails to "cover **every activity and role** described" accurately; roles underexplored (no multi-role), misses narrative nuances (e.g., escalation to Officer, Treasury scheduling/release/notify consolidated wrong).

**Net: 2.0** (Minimal credit for vocabulary/partial activity mapping; everything else critically flawed under utmost strictness. Even "small" mismatches like empty C/I or wrong structure deduct heavily.)
