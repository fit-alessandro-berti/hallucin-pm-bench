The LLM answer correctly concludes that the fact is not accurate and provides explicit evidence from the listed cases. It also correctly points out that in case 1002, Update_Inventory does not occur. The answer shows the sequence of activities in each relevant case, demonstrating that Authorize_Refund does not immediately precede Update_Inventory.

However, points are deducted for the following reasons:

- The answer could have been more explicit in stating for each case the relative order of the activities​ (i.e., that Authorize_Refund always comes after Update_Inventory in available cases).
- It does not explicitly state that "in none of the cases does Authorize_Refund immediately precede Update_Inventory," which is the clearest possible statement.
- It refers to immediate precedence but could make even clearer that the event order is the reverse of the claim for every case.
- The ground truth also formalizes the precise line numbers and highlights how “always” is disproved, which the LLM answer could have mirrored for rigor and strictness.

These are subtle but meaningful shortcomings under a meticulous, strict grading regime.
