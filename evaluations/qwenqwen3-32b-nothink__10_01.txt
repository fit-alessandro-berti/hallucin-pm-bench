5.0

**Justification:**

- **Terminology/Spelling/Capitalization:** The LLM answer uses the required preferred terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") *correctly* and never mentions forbidden alternatives. This fulfills a core requirement.

- **Format:** The matrix is presented as requested with activities as rows, roles as columns. Role abbreviations are included, which is acceptable.

**Errors and Point Deductions (strict criteria):**

1. **Major RACI Assignments Errors:**
   - *Missing R/A, C, I distinctions*: The LLM answer provides only "R" marks and does not distinguish "Accountable", "Consulted", or "Informed" (whereas the ground truth provides "R/A", "A", "C", and "I" assignments).
   - *Underspecification*: In every activity, only a single role is marked "R" with all others left blank, failing to reflect the multi-role engagement per the ground truth. This is a significant process mapping inaccuracy.
     - E.g., "KYC Review" â€” only CO (Compliance Officer) is "R"; Account Manager should be "A", Finance Clerk "C", IT "I".
     - "Order Vetting" and "Notify Customer" have the same error.
   - *No differentiation between Responsible and Accountable*, despite ground truth marking (e.g., "R/A") or A separately for certain roles.

2. **Impact:** While the correct activities and roles are used and the required vocabulary policy is fully satisfied, the matrix fails in the main professional purpose: correct and complete RACI assignment for all participants.

**Why not lower?**
- The core vocabulary policy is strictly obeyed, spelling and formatting are correct, and no extra content is present.

**Why such a harsh penalty?**
- In process mapping, *correct RACI assignment is critical*. Systematic omission of Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (and partial assignment of Responsible) makes the answer severely incomplete and misleading.

**Summary:**  
Half marks (5.0) are awarded for meeting terminology and structure requirements, but critical errors in RACI assignments result in the loss of the remaining points.
