3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology adherence (major strength, per rubric)**: Perfect compliance with vocabulary policy. All mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are used exactly, with correct capitalization and no forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). This alone warrants high marks in this area (+2.0 points).
- **RACI allocations (major weakness)**: Each row has exactly one Responsible (R), aligning with the narrative's primary handlers—good on that narrow point (+1.0). However, the matrix is severely incomplete: no Accountable (A), Consulted (C), or Informed (I) designations are provided, leaving most cells blank instead of fully specifying roles as in the ground truth. Ground truth explicitly shows AM as Accountable (often R/A) in key steps (e.g., Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer), and includes C/I across roles (e.g., CO as C in Receive Application). This omission misrepresents a complete RACI matrix and deviates substantially from the ground truth (-3.0 points total deduction for incompleteness and failure to reflect nuanced accountability).
- **Formatting and structure (minor issues, but strict penalty)**: Headers include unnecessary abbreviations in parentheses (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), unlike the clean ground truth versions—small error, but per instructions, deduct significantly (-0.5). No bolding on mandated activities or R cells, which ground truth uses for emphasis—another small but penalized deviation (-0.5). No unwarranted extras (e.g., no new tasks/roles), so no further penalty here.
- **Overall correctness and fidelity to ground truth**: While the core structure (rows/columns) and primary R's match the narrative basics, the response is a skeletal version of RACI, ignoring the full implications of roles (e.g., implied consultations like CO in KYC-adjacent steps). Strict rubric demands close alignment; multiple differences compound to a low score, reflecting ~35% fidelity (basic skeleton + terminology vs. full, detailed matrix).
