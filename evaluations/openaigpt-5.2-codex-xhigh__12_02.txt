The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying both counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11) with precise line citations, accurately refuting the "always follows" claim, and structured as "No" followed by a single justifying paragraph. Minor deductions for stylistic differences: inline sentences vs. bulleted list, inclusion of accurate-but-unnecessary timestamps, bolding (** **) vs. italics (* *), lack of explicit "not always" phrasing and concluding proof sentence, and slightly less emphatic wording on C005's absence ("no ... at all" vs. "never contains ... at all"). These are small formatting/verbosity variances, not factual errors, but per strict criteria warrant a slight point loss from perfection.
