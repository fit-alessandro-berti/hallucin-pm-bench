9.2

a) The LLM answer effectively covers both decision points, accurately describes the conditional branch after the Tri-Color Risk Check, and states the decision rule for TriVote clearly. There is minor excess verbosity and some redundant wording ("the process checks whether..."). However, it makes no substantive errors nor omissions.

b) The document list matches the ground truth exactly in both content and order, and all document names are correct. The brief context ("input in Step 3", etc.) is not required but isn't penalizing.

The only reason for a modest deduction is that, for maximum strictness, phrases could be crisper and directly mirror the ground truth for each sentence ("the process checks whether..." could simply state the decision rule). However, all requirements are met, and there are no errors, so the penalty is slight.

Final assessment: 9.2
