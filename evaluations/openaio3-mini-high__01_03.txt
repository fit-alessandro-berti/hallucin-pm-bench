9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying both decision points with rules that closely match the ground truth (e.g., the conditional skip logic and the "any two out of three" TriVote rule are precisely captured without alteration or hallucination). The document list in part (b) is identical in sequence and completeness to the ground truth, including the distinction between "Offer Sheet 77" and "Signed Offer Sheet 77." No prohibited elements (e.g., KYC/AML mentions) are introduced.

However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.0 point for minor differences: 
- Part (a) includes unnecessary introductory details (e.g., "After receiving the three scorecards... determine a Low, Medium, or High risk rating") and slight rephrasing (e.g., "designated roles" vs. "approvers"; "to pass the gate and proceed with the offer" vs. the ground truth's concise "record 'Approve'"), deviating from the one-sentence-per-rule conciseness.
- Part (b) adds explanatory parentheticals (e.g., step references and action verbs like "appears in" or "generated in"), which are factually correct but expand beyond the ground truth's bare list format.
- Extraneous closing sentence ("This summary identifies...") introduces unrequested framing.

These small additions create textual differences without errors, justifying a high but not perfect score.
