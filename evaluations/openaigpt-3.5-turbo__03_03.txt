**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
- **XML Validity (Major Deduction: -4.0)**: Invalid BPMN 2.0 schema. Non-standard `<incoming>["..."]</incoming>` and `<outgoing>["...", "..."]</outgoing>` elements on tasks/gateways do not exist in BPMN 2.0 (connections via `sequenceFlow` `sourceRef`/`targetRef` only). Missing `sequenceFlow id="wrc_flow2"` definition breaks loop. Inconsistent refs (e.g., completeness gw incoming lists "wrc_flow2" but receives "wrc_flow3").
- **Missing Required Elements (Major Deduction: -2.0)**: Omits **two explicit tasks** – "send rejection notice" (end event wrongly named it instead of task → end); "close the claim" (end event wrongly named "Close Claim" instead of task → end). Omits **parallel-split gateway** (requires explicit "parallel-split / parallel-join gateway pair"; LLM has only one `parallelGateway` as join).
- **Incorrect Flow Structure (Major Deduction: -1.5)**: Wrong parallel split – diverges directly from exclusive `wrc_Warranty_Decision` to two tasks (invalid; exclusive gw ≠ parallel split). Loop connections broken/miswired (validate → gw directly, but loop via undefined flow2). No conditions/names on flows (ground truth has "Yes"/"No").
- **Task Names Not Verbatim (Significant Deduction: -0.5)**: All mismatch prompt bolded text (e.g., "Validate Claim" ≠ "validates the claim"; missing "the"/"s", wrong caps; "Create Shipment Order" ≠ "Create shipment order"; same for others). Ground truth closer but still approximate; LLM worse.
- **Other Minor Mismatches (-0.0 net as partial credit)**: ID prefix "wrc_" consistent; two end events present; completeness/warranty exclusive gws present; namespace/attrs differ but semantically ok; extra exporter attrs irrelevant.

**Total: 10.0 - 8.0 = 2.0**. Attempts core flow but non-equivalent (omissions, invalidity, wrong gateways/flows prevent semantic match to prompt/ground truth). Not minimal-correct like 34-line ground truth.
