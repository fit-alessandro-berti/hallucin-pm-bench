The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway change for `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). However, it deducts points for: (1) unnecessary title ("# Change-log Analysis..."), violating the "list only the factual differences" instruction; (2) reversed presentation of task info (id first, then name with em dash, vs. ground truth's name first in parens with "id ="); (3) omission of version specifics "(v1)" and "(v2)" in gateway change; (4) differing formatting (## headers, â€¢ bullets vs. ** bold and * bullets); (5) lack of closing note "(No other differences should be reported)". These are small but accumulate under strict evaluation, though core content is accurate and no speculation or extras like sequence flows are added.
