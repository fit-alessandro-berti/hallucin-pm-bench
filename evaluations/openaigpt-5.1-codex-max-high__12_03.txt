The LLM answer correctly answers **No** and provides accurate counterexamples (C002 and C004) with precise sequences and timestamps, directly refuting the "always" claim by citing relevant violations, as required. Justification is concise, evidence-based, and relies only on the log. Minor deduction for not exhaustively analyzing all cases (e.g., omitting confirmations in C001/C003 like the ground truth table), which reduces meticulousness despite sufficiency for disproof; format lacks table structure but meets task specs. No factual errors.
