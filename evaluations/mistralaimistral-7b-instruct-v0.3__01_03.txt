**1.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) – Major failures (contributes ~0.5/5.0)**: Ground truth identifies **exactly 2 decision points** (the risk-skip conditional and TriVote gate), each summarized precisely in one sentence. LLM incorrectly labels **9 items** as "decision points," including non-decisions (e.g., receiving Form 14B, assigning Deck Officer, preparing documents). This inflates and distorts the list. The two actual decisions are partially described but lack precision (e.g., "€250,000 or less" vs. exact "≤ €250 000"; verbose embedding). No adherence to "one sentence each" or focus on gates/branches only.
- **Part (b) – Major failures (contributes ~1.0/5.0)**: Ground truth lists **9 documents** in strict first-appearance order, including all three Scorecards (inputs to step 3). LLM lists only **6**, **omits Scorecard–Cyan/Magenta/Yellow entirely** (critical hallucination-by-omission), adds erroneous conditionality to Deck Memo ("only if..."), and reverses order of ID Matrix Declaration and Signed Offer Sheet 77 (step 8 lists Signed first). Signed Offer Sheet 77 is treated redundantly/ inaccurately.
- **Overall**: ~80% deviation in content, structure, completeness, and fidelity. No policy violations or hallucinations of absent items (e.g., no KYC), but strictness demands near-exact match; large errors (missing docs, wrong count/order, misidentified decisions) warrant severe deduction from 10.0.
