### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Core Correctness (High Alignment, +9.0 base)**: Both correctly refuse to compute/derive the value, adhering to the system instruction ("state clearly that the requested value cannot be derived"). LLM explicitly uses the prescribed phrasing ("cannot be derived"), cites missing durations/log data, and dismisses benchmarks—directly matching the data-driven refusal required.
- **Explanation Quality (Minor Deductions, -0.5 total)**:
  - LLM provides a brief, accurate explanation (missing durations, irrelevant benchmarks), fulfilling Q2 ("briefly explain your calculation") by explaining *why no calculation is possible*.
  - Ground truth is slightly more precise (mentions "timestamps, durations or ordering information" and "temporal value per event"), emphasizing cycle time specifics. LLM omits "ordering/timestamps" explicitly (though implies via "duration info") and "fabricated" risk—small gaps in depth (-0.3).
- **Structure & Clarity (Minor Deductions, -0.3 total)**:
  - LLM's response is concise but includes visible chain-of-thought leakage ("Wait, but...", repetitive phrasing like "So I'll say"), making it less polished/clean than ground truth's structured "> Quote + **Reasoning:**" format (-0.2).
  - No direct numbering for Q1/Q2; bolded "**Cannot be derived**" is emphatic but not identical to ground truth's "**cannot be computed**" (-0.1).
- **Strictness Applied**: No fabrication/invention (major win). Differences are phrasing ("derived" vs. "computed"), detail nuance, and minor messiness—warranting ~0.8-point loss from 10.0. Perfect match would mirror ground truth verbatim.
