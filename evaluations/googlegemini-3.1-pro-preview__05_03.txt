The LLM answer is functionally identical and correct for the task—adding an interrupting boundary timer (PT48H) on `Activity_CreateAccount` with flow to the existing `Activity_AMReview`—but loses points under utmost strictness for: (1) different/missing IDs (`Timer_SLA_48h` vs `Boundary_LateCreate`, extra `TimerDef_01`, `Flow_Escalation` vs `Flow_LateEscalation`); (2) missing `name="48h breach"` on boundaryEvent; (3) lacking explanatory comments and numbering; (4) justification wording divergences ("stuck process", "previously unused", "service task", "manual intervention" vs precise GT phrasing), making it not verbatim. These small textual/attribution differences warrant a 1.0 deduction despite semantic equivalence.
