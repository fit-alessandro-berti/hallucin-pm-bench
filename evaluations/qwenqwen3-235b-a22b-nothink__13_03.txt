7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1 (Perfect match, 10/10 contribution)**: The LLM correctly identifies exactly 1 occurrence of “Manual Fraud Check” with precise reference to CaseID 1002 and timestamp, aligning verbatim with the ground truth's count and detail. No errors.

- **Question 2 (Partial match, 5/10 contribution)**: The response is concise (under 120 words) and captures key ideas like small sample size (3 cases), lack of full-month context, and activity naming variations, which echo the ground truth's emphasis on tiny excerpts and string-matching issues. However, it introduces speculation (e.g., hypothetical "Fraud Check (Manual)" naming not in the data, atypical case volumes, timestamp clustering effects), violating the "no speculation" rule and diverging from the data-driven focus. It misses critical ground truth elements: quantitative sampling error (e.g., 0% to 7% swing, wide confidence interval), rare-event volatility, specific in-log synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), and the need for random larger samples. These omissions and additions create meaningful differences, warranting a significant deduction under strict criteria.

- **Overall**: Strong on Q1 and thematic overlap in Q2, but speculation and incomplete statistical precision lower the score. Total weighted average reflects ~70% alignment.
