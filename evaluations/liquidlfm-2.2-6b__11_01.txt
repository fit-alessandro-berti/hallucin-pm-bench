4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (2.5/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies #1 (Request_Documents) with accurate waiting times (36.5h avg, 120h p95). However, it fails to select the actual top three worst by avg waiting time: #2 should be Send_Closure_Letter (12.2h), and #3 Assess_Liability (7.8h). Instead, it incorrectly inserts Initial_Screening (2.1h, ranked 4th overall) as #2 and demotes Assess_Liability to #3. Numbers quoted for the chosen activities match the table, but the selection and ranking violate the "strictly by waiting-time" criterion, introducing major factual errors.
  
- **No Unwarranted Content (8/10)**: No mentions of service times, throughput, or unlisted activities. The memo stays focused on waiting times only, which aligns with restrictions.

- **Action Relevance (5/10)**: Each action is concrete, tied to waiting-time reduction, and claims ≥20% improvement (e.g., AI automation for documents, APIs for screening). However, two actions apply to incorrect activities (Initial_Screening instead of Send_Closure_Letter; Assess_Liability's action is plausible but misranked). Ground truth actions are more precisely data-driven (e.g., referencing pilots/escalations), while LLM's feel generic and unsupported (no "data-driven" evidence like pilots or estimates tied to table data).

- **Format & Constraints (4/10)**: Crisp memo style under 150 words (~120 words). Includes ranking, quotes both metrics per activity, and one action each. But deviates from ground truth structure (e.g., no verbatim quoting style like "#1 Activity – avg X h, p95 Y h"; includes extraneous title and closing sentence not in ground truth, bloating it slightly).

Overall, the response is polished but undermined by critical errors in activity selection/ranking, leading to a low score under strict evaluation. It matches ~30% of ground truth content accurately.
