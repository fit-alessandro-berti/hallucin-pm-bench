The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact matching content for added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway type changes, adhering to the required structure and avoiding any extraneous commentary or guesses. However, it deviates from the ground truth in formatting: lacking bullet points (-) before each item and missing alignment spacing on the second gateway line (e.g., no spaces after the colon in "Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel"). Under utmost strictness, these small presentational differences warrant a deduction, though the core accuracy remains high.
