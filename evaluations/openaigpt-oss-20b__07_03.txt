7.0

- The LLM answer captures all the correct differences and does not introduce errors or commentary, which is positive.
- It omits the required list formatting ("- " before each item), which is explicitly present in the ground truth and instructed by the prompt for strict conformance; this is a significant format error.
- For gateways, the LLM omits the extra spaces after the colon and does not align IDs/text to match the ground truth (also missing alignment on Gateway_Payment).
- The wording for each difference is correct, but the level of format deviation would have operational or review consequences under strict review. Therefore, a significant deduction is necessary despite the correct content.
