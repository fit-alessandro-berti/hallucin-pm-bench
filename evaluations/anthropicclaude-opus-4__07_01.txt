The LLM answer correctly identifies the key changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the factual differences in the XML snippets. However, it incurs significant deductions for multiple strict deviations from the ground truth: 

- Fails to include task names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" instead of just "check_vip"), which are explicit in the XML and included in the ground truth, omitting crucial descriptive details.
- Uses inconsistent formatting: bullet points with "-" and bolded headings with "• **", versus ground truth's "*" bullets, plain bold headings without "•", backticks for IDs, and bolded gateway types.
- Omits version specifiers "(v1)" and "(v2)" in the gateway change description, reducing precision.
- Lacks the ground truth's closing note, though not strictly required by the prompt.

These omissions and formatting mismatches represent incomplete factual reporting and non-exact adherence, warranting a mid-range score despite core accuracy.
