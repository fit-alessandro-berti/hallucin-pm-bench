7.0

• The LLM answer **does correctly list the ids** of the added and removed tasks and the gateway type change, so the semantics of the diff are essentially captured.

• However, it fails to follow key ground truth instructions:
  - **It omits the task names.** Ground truth includes both name and id; the LLM only puts ids.
  - Formatting differs: bullet point style is inconsistent with the expected headings and formatting.
  - For the gateway type change, the LLM does not highlight or specify both the id and the specific BPMN tags (i.e., the explicit “exclusiveGateway” to “inclusiveGateway” transition), or make the change as explicit as the ground truth (which writes the element names in bold).

• Strictness: Even though all factual changes are covered, omitting task names is a substantial omission, and lack of details in the gateway type change causes a significant loss of points, per the evaluation rubric.

• No extra or speculative differences are included, so the answer isn’t factually wrong—just incomplete and not sufficiently precise.

**Hence a 7.0.**
