### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Terminology (mandated synonyms and avoidance of forbidden terms)**: Perfect match. "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" are used exactly as required (with correct capitalization), and no legacy/forbidden terms appear. No loss here, but this is the only area without deduction.
- **Structure and Content (activities, roles, no unwarranted additions)**: Activities match exactly (6 rows, correct order). No extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. However, roles use abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full names (Account Manager, etc.), which mismatches the ground truth and reduces clarity/professionalism in a matrix context. Minor formatting issues (no bolding on key activities like **KYC Review**; "R/A" lacks spaces as "**R / A**"; no bolding on R/A entries) compound this. Deduction: -1.5 points for mismatches in presentation and role labeling.
- **RACI Allocations (correctness to narrative and ground truth)**: Major failures. Each activity has exactly one Responsible (correct per notes), and AM is Accountable where directly handling (e.g., Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer). However:
  - Incomplete matrix: Blanks for non-primary roles ignore Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments, which are explicit in ground truth (e.g., all activities have C/I for 2-3 roles; LLM leaves ~80% of cells blank). This does not "reflect the narrative" fully, as the sequential workflow implies consultations/informations (e.g., CO as C for Order Vetting).
  - Errors in Accountability: For KYC Review, LLM assigns R/A to CO (incorrect; ground truth has CO as R, AM as A). For Payment Clearance, R/A to FC (incorrect; ground truth has FC as R, AM as A). For Record Update, R/A to IT (incorrect; ground truth has IT as R but no A, with C/I for others—LLM over-assigns A without basis).
  - No separation of R and A where ground truth does (e.g., **R** and A as distinct cells). These are not small errors; they misrepresent roles and violate standard RACI (one R per activity is met, but A is misplaced, and C/I are omitted entirely).
  Deduction: -4.5 points for incompleteness, misallocations, and failure to infer/apply full RACI per workflow narrative/ground truth.

Overall: The answer captures the core handlers but is a skeletal, inaccurate version of the full RACI. With strictness applied (significant loss for each difference, including incompleteness as a major gap), it earns a low passing score but far from excellent.
