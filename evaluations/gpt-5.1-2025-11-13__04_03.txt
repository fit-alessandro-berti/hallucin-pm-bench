The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses Rules 2, 3, and 4, including the key violation in Rule 3 due to NA occurring before RA. However, it deducts points for incorrectly violating Rule 1: the rule only requires QE and RA to occur once each and in that order (QE before RA), which is satisfied here despite NA in between; the LLM's assumption of stricter sequencing (e.g., no interruptions) is not supported by the ruleset, introducing a significant interpretive error. The format is close but less structured than the ground truth table, though still concise and referential.
