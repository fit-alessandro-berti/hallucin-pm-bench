6.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (partial credit):** The LLM correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides accurate evidence for Cases 1001 and 1003, noting the reversed ordering of "Update_Inventory" before "Authorize_Refund" in both, and correctly states there are no instances of the claimed sequence. This aligns well with the ground truth's core reasoning for those cases.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness):** 
  - Major omission: The LLM entirely ignores Case 1002, where "Update_Inventory" is absent despite "Authorize_Refund" occurring. This directly disproves the "always" claim (as highlighted in the ground truth), making the justification incomplete and less comprehensive. Under utmost strictness, this error alone warrants a substantial point loss, as it fails to cite all relevant cases.
  - Minor structural issues: Lacks the ground truth's per-case bullet-point breakdown and line citations (e.g., "lines 3-4" or "lines 11 & 14"), resulting in a less precise, evidence-based format. The justification is more narrative but doesn't emphasize the absence in Case 1002 as a falsifier.
  - No guessing or extraneous content, which is good, but the response is shorter and less thorough overall.

Overall, the answer is directionally correct but critically incomplete, justifying a mid-range score with deductions for the key gap and precision.
