7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Core solution identical—interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` with PT48H duration, connected to existing `Activity_AMReview`. Justification is functionally equivalent (1 sentence, explains SLA enforcement via escalation).
- **Major deductions (-2.8 total)**:
  - Missing `name="48h breach"` on boundaryEvent (-0.8; ground truth specifies descriptive name).
  - Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (-1.0; potential BPMN schema non-compliance, as ground truth uses it explicitly).
  - No explanatory comments (e.g., `<!-- ❶ -->`, `<!-- ❷ -->`) (-0.5; ground truth structures additions clearly).
  - Different, arbitrary IDs (`Boundary_Timer_01`/`Flow_TimerToReview` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`/`Flow_LateEscalation`) (-0.3; less descriptive/precise).
  - Justification wording/formatting not exact (no bolding, "**pre-existing**" omitted, no "*Justification (1 sentence):*" prefix) (-0.2).
- **Strictness note**: Semantically correct but syntactically incomplete/non-matching in 5+ details = ~28% penalty from 10.0. No new activities added, fully compliant with task.
