8.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, correctly identifying "Non-compliant" and properly assessing all five rules' compliance (satisfied or violated), with matching citations to events and rules. Justifications are detailed, structured, and cite relevant evidence, aligning closely with the ground truth in substance and conclusion (violations in Rules 2 and 3). However, under utmost strictness:

- **Rule 3 numerical error (-1.0)**: States "distance of **4**" vs. ground truth "distance = 3". This mismatches the ground truth's explicit metric (likely |10-6|-1=3 intervening events), despite correct violation conclusion.
- **Rule 4 wording error (-0.5)**: "No other Intern→CFO adjacency" reverses the rule's direction ("Intern ... directly follow ... CFO", i.e., CFO→Intern forbidden). Context clarifies intent, but phrasing is imprecise/wrong.
- **Minor extras (-0.0, no deduction)**: ✅/❌ icons, bolding, summary, and descriptive titles enhance clarity without contradicting format requirements ("numbered justification that cites the relevant rules").

Total deductions reflect small but verifiable differences; perfect match would be 10.0.
