**8.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
**Part a) Decision Points: 10.0/10.0**  
- Identifies exactly the two decision points (the risk/amount conditional skip and TriVote gate).  
- Each rule summarized accurately in one sentence, matching ground truth logic precisely (e.g., "Low or Medium **and** requested-amount ≤ €250 000" vs. LLM's equivalent "Low or Medium **and** ... €250,000 or less"; TriVote "any two approvals suffice/out of three" captured as "at least two of the three").  
- No omissions, additions, or hallucinations. Minor phrasing/title differences (e.g., "Conditional Branch (Step 4)" vs. "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check") are stylistic, not substantive errors.

**Part b) Documents List: 6.4/10.0**  
- Lists 8/9 documents correctly identified from the process, in proper first-appearance order (Form 14B → scorecards in Step 3 → Deck Memo in Step 5 → Offer Sheet 77 in Step 7 → ID Matrix Declaration & Loan Dossier 2025 in Steps 8/9).  
- **Major error (significant deduction):** Completely omits **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (explicitly named in Step 8 as a distinct required document alongside ID Matrix Declaration; ground truth lists it separately as #7, first appearing in Step 8). This is a clear incompleteness—"**all** documents"—not a small error.  
- **Minor errors (further deductions):**  
  - Places ID Matrix Declaration (#7 in LLM) without the preceding Signed Offer Sheet 77 in Step 8, disrupting sequence fidelity (ground truth: Offer Sheet 77 → Signed Offer Sheet 77 → ID Matrix Declaration).  
  - Adds parenthetical descriptions/explanations (e.g., "(Application, Step 1)"), which are accurate but extraneous to the task's "List **all** documents... in the order they first appear" (plain list expected).  
  - Notes Deck Memo as "conditional," which is true but adds unrequested detail.  
- No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML).  

**Overall Score Calculation:** (10.0 * 0.5) + (6.4 * 0.5) = 8.2. Perfect on a), but b)'s omission of a named document and sequence issue warrant ~30% penalty under "utmost strictness" for completeness/accuracy differences vs. ground truth.
