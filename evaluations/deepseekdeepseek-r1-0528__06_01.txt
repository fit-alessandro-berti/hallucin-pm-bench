The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"), with proper internal alphabetization (C before Q; P before S) and overall list order (C-pair before P-pair), matching the ground truth content exactly. No incorrect pairs or omissions. However, under strict evaluation:

- **Format deviations (significant deduction: -2.0 points)**: The prompt specifies a simple output of "one pair per line" in the exact format `Task_X  —  Task_Y`, without wrappers, code blocks, or alignment. The LLM adds an introductory sentence, encloses pairs in a markdown code block labeled "plaintext" (altering visual/structure), uses inconsistent spacing (e.g., single spaces around "—" without vertical alignment as in ground truth), and appends a numbered explanation plus bulleted notes. This exceeds the concise output format, introducing unnecessary structure not requested.
  
- **Extra content (minor deduction: -0.5 points)**: While the ground truth includes a "*Rationale*" section with bullet points, the LLM's explanation is more verbose and integrated (e.g., bolding, step numbering, explicit "Notes" section), diverging from the prompt's focus on pairs-only output. This bloats the response beyond a strict match.

The answer is functionally accurate but not a precise replica, warranting a mid-high score rather than perfect (10.0 requires near-identical output fidelity).
