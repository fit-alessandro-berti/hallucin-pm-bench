4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer shows partial alignment with the ground truth but incurs heavy penalties for multiple structural, content, and assignment differences. Key issues include:

- **Role Columns (Major penalty, -3.0 points):** LLM uses only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support (3 roles, adhering to mandated terms without extras). Ground truth introduces an unmandated "Operations Manager" (4 roles total), shifting many "A" (Accountable) assignments to it. This creates mismatches across all rows where accountability is reassigned (e.g., Task 1: LLM places "A" on Analyst vs. ground's Ops; Tasks 3-4: LLM "R,A" on Liaison vs. ground's "R" on Liaison + "A" on Ops). No inclusion or mapping to Operations Manager in LLM is a critical omission relative to ground truth.

- **Number and Mapping of Tasks (Major penalty, -2.0 points):** LLM expands to 8 rows, splitting source elements (e.g., separate rows for "Release payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent"; adds "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case closure"). Ground truth condenses to 6 rows, omitting explicit coverage of SWIFT sending and notification (likely bundled implicitly into "Release Payment" and "Archive Record"). This results in extra/unsynchronized rows in LLM (e.g., no ground equivalent for rows 6 and 8), violating direct mapping. Small wording variances (e.g., LLM's "Conduct sanctions screening" vs. ground's "Screen Against Sanctions List"; inclusion of "on sender and beneficiary" in LLM's KYC row) add minor but penalized divergence.

- **RACI Assignments (Major penalty, -2.5 points):** Even for overlapping tasks, assignments frequently differ due to missing role:
  - Task 1 equivalent: LLM "R,A" on Analyst vs. ground "R" on Analyst + "A" on Ops; IT "C" matches.
  - Task 2: IT "I" in LLM vs. "C" in ground (small but strict loss); rest close.
  - Tasks 3-4: "A" placement mismatch (Liaison in LLM vs. Ops in ground); core "R/C/I" aligns partially.
  - Task 5: "A" on Analyst in LLM vs. Ops in ground.
  - Archive equivalent (LLM row 7 vs. ground row 6): Analyst "I" in LLM vs. "C" in ground; IT "R,A" in LLM vs. "R" in ground + "A" on Ops.
  These shifts compound errors, with no exact row-for-row match.

- **Formatting and Extras (Minor penalties, -1.0 points total):** LLM adds a "#" column and title (absent in ground truth's table); legend phrasing differs slightly ("R = Responsible A = Accountable C = Consulted I = Informed" vs. ground's "R = Responsible   A = Accountable   C = Consulted   I = Informed"). Ground truth includes a post-table note on vocabulary adherence, which LLM implies but doesn't explicitly state. LLM correctly mandates vocabulary (e.g., "KYC Review", no forbidden terms), earning no penalty here—but strict comparison to ground truth's exact structure deducts.

- **Strengths (Partial credit baseline):** LLM fully covers source text without omissions (unlike ground truth's implied bundling), uses mandated terms precisely (e.g., bolding in ground's KYC row is stylistic, not content), and produces a clear Markdown table. This prevents a total wipeout, starting from a ~6.5 baseline before penalties.

Overall, while LLM is arguably more complete and prompt-compliant in isolation, the instruction mandates grading strictly against ground truth differences, resulting in a low-mid score. No single element is perfect; cumulative errors dominate.
