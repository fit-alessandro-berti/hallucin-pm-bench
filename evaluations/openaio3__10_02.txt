5.0

**Reasoning:**

**Strengths:**
- Correctly uses the mandated terms “KYC Review,” “Regulatory Liaison,” and “Transaction Analyst”; there is no accidental use of prohibited vocabulary.
- Maps most process steps to those terms, generally aligning the roles and tasks with the informal description.

**Major Issues and Penalties:**
1. **Extra/Unmandated Steps (Significant Error, -2 pts):**
   - The LLM answer invents two tasks not present in the ground truth or source text:  
     - “Notify Regulatory Liaison of case closure”  
     - “Ensure SWIFT message is sent” (the latter should just be archiving, not notification).
   - The ground truth merges the SWIFT message into “Release Payment,” not as a separate SWIFT operational task.

2. **Missing Role (Operations Manager) (Serious Error, -1.5 pts):**
   - The LLM answer omits the “Operations Manager” role, which is included (and assigned ‘A’ in all steps) in the ground truth.
   - Ground truth expects each task to have an “A”; in the LLM’s table, Accountable is sometimes given to those who are also Responsible (e.g., Transaction Analyst is both R and A in multiple steps).

3. **Incorrect RACI Assignments/Poor Mapping (Significant Error, -1.0 pts):**
   - The Accountable role is repeatedly misassigned (e.g., Regulatory Liaison and Transaction Analyst both have R and A simultaneously in several tasks, which violates RACI best practices and the mapping required by ground truth).
   - At times, “I” is assigned to IT Support/Regulatory Liaison where, per ground truth, that role should be “C” or omitted.
   - “Archive case file” is split into two (archive + notification) steps, which is unnecessary.

4. **Task Naming Not Fully Aligned (Minor Error, -0.5 pts):**
   - Several tasks in the LLM table are not succinctly labeled as in the ground truth (“Screen Against Sanctions List” being described as “Conduct sanctions screening,” etc.), showing lack of strict mapping to mandated terminology.

**Summary:**  
The answer demonstrates fairly good awareness of the vocabulary restrictions and overall intent, but introduces extra steps, omits a required role, and mishandles RACI assignments and task naming. These are significant flaws given the requirement for strictness and exact mapping. Thus, **5.0/10**.
