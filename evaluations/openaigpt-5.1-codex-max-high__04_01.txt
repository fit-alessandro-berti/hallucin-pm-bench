**8.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and precisely cites the two relevant violated rules (2 and 3) with accurate event references and reasoning matching the ground truth, fully justifying the decision. No factual errors or misinterpretations. Minor deductions for incompleteness: it omits explicit checks/confirmations for the three satisfied rules (1, 4, 5), less detailed phrasing for Rule 3 (no explicit "next two are 7/8" or "distance=3"), lack of bold formatting/structure, and no summary conclusion—differing from the ground truth's comprehensive, exhaustive audit of *all* five rules. Under utmost strictness, this structural/completeness gap warrants a significant but not severe penalty, as the essentials for non-compliance are perfectly handled.
