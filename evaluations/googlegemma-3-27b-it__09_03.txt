The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in structure, content, and precision: it correctly identifies the impossibility due to redacted timestamps and row data in Artefact A, specifies the metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, confidence interval) that cannot be computed, explains the role of the missing start_time/complete_time for "Approve Invoice" durations, and notes Artefact B's irrelevance without speculationâ€”all in one short paragraph. Minor wording variations (e.g., "durations for each instance" vs. "concrete times for any execution"; explicit mention of hours-implied metric vs. not) are stylistic and do not introduce errors or deviations from the prompt's requirements.
