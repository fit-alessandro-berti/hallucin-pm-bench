9.5

The LLM answer is precise, accurate, and matches the ground truth in recognizing that the computation is impossible due to the absence of timestamped data. It correctly explains that the critical fields ("start_time" and "complete_time") are missing, making any metric calculation impossible.

The only minor deviation is verbosity and the indirect way the LLM refers to the lack of necessary data ("these values are missing" instead of directly stating "all event rows and timestamps are redacted"). Additionally, it slightly over-elaborates by mentioning Artefact B's irrelevance, which, though true, was less succinct than the ground truth.

Due to the slightly longer exposition and the minor indirectness, a small reduction in score is warranted, giving this answer a 9.5.
