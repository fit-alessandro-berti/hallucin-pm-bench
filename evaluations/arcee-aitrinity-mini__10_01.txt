**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology (partial credit, but undermined)**: Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance" in matrix rows (+0.5). However, explicitly mentions forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") in notes, violating "do **not** mention... even in brackets or quotes" (-1.0).
- **Table Structure (-2.0)**: Wrong format—uses R/A/C/I as columns with single entries and vague placeholders (e.g., "[Other roles]") instead of roles (AM/CO/FC/IT) as columns with combined entries (e.g., "R / A"). Introduces extra columns and non-standard layout.
- **RACI Assignments (-3.0)**: Does not match ground truth; major deviations per activity:
  | Activity            | Key Mismatches |
  |---------------------|----------------|
  | Receive Application | I as "[Other roles]" (GT specifies FC/IT I); minor but placeholder invalid. |
  | KYC Review          | A=CO (GT: AM); no FC C; C/AM swapped. |
  | Order Vetting       | C="[Compliance Manager]" (GT: CO C; extra role). |
  | Payment Clearance   | A=FC (GT: AM); C=IT/I=[CO] (GT: CO C/IT I swapped). |
  | Record Update       | A=IT (GT: none specified as A); C="[Finance Manager]" (GT: AM/FC C; extra role); I/AM swapped. |
  | Notify Customer     | C="[IT Support]/I=[CO]" (GT: all I, no extras). |
  - Violates "each activity has exactly one *Responsible*" (some imply multiples); AM not "Accountable where appropriate".
- **Unwarranted Content (-2.0)**: Introduces extra roles ("Compliance Manager", "Finance Manager"); placeholders; lengthy notes inventing logic/counts ("AM (6 R/A)"); "Key" section; header fluff. No extras allowed.
- **Overall Correctness (0.5 max)**: Fails rubric—does not "reflect the narrative" per GT allocations; heavy invention.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Cumulative errors (structural, factual, violations) warrant minimum score; no partial credit for surface matches (e.g., some R alignments) as differences dominate.
