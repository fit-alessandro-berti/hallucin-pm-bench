The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides accurate counterexamples matching the ground truth (C003 lines 6-7 with Validate_Payment before Receive_Order; C005 with Validate_Payment at line 11 lacking any prior Receive_Order). Citations are precise, and the justification disproves "always" effectively in one paragraph as instructed. Minor deductions for unnecessary extras: listing positive cases (C001, C002, C004 with specific lines, irrelevant to disproof), mentioning irrelevant Cancel_Order (line 12), and slightly less concise phrasing compared to ground truth's focused bullets—differences in emphasis and length under strict evaluation warrant ~0.8-point loss from perfect match.
