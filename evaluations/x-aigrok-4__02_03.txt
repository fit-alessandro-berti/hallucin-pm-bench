8.0

- The LLM answer correctly gives the counts/names of distinct cases, the correct immediate predecessor for "Ship_Order" in C456, and the correct activity that appears exactly once.
- However, it omits the explicit listing of the case IDs for question 1 ("C123, C456, C789") and does not make explicit which question each bullet belongs to. Since the ground truth gives both the count and the enumerated case names in A1, this is a small but meaningful omission, warranting a deduction.
- "Pack_Items" for A2 and "Cancel_Order" for A3 are both correct.
- Conciseness matches the prompt.

Thus, an 8.0 reflects a clearly correct, concise answer but lacking the full detail (case IDs) of the ground truth.
