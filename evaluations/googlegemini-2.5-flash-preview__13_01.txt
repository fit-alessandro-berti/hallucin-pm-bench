9.0

1. The LLM correctly reports the count: "1" (matches ground truth).
2. The percentage is correct: "5.56%" (with accurate calculation, rounded as instructed).
3. The case identifier is correct: "A1002" (exact per ground truth).
4. Both sampling-related reasons are valid:
   - "This fragment only covers a single day..." properly describes temporal bias (matches or is functionally equivalent to the ground truth's "temporal bias").
   - "The sample size is very small..." clearly matches ground truth's "small sample size".

Minor point loss (âˆ’1.0): The LLM does not explicitly mention that the fragment only covers the morning of May 1, 2025, nor does it mention other viable biases (case-mix, survivorship bias) as alternate options, thus being slightly less thorough than the ideal. Otherwise, the format and information strictly adhere to the instructions, with no unjustified inference or hallucination.
