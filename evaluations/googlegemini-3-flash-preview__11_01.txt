7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correctness (activities/numbers: 10/10)**: Top 3 by avg waiting time perfectly identified/ranked (Request_Documents 36.5/120.0, Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0, Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4). Metrics quoted verbatim from table; no extraneous activities, service-time, or throughput discussed.
- **No unwarranted content (9/10)**: Clean; minor deduction for closing "reduce overall cycle time" (implies broader metrics, contra ground truth note to omit non-waiting).
- **Action relevance/format (4.5/10)**: Actions concrete/logically tied to waiting (e.g., automation for docs/letters, triage for assessment). Memo crisp (<150 words, executive style). **Major flaws**: No explicit "≥20% cut" per action (prompt requirement; ground truth states it directly, e.g., "≥25%", "30%"). Not "data-driven" (no pilots/estimates cited; pure suggestions vs. ground truth's "pilot tests show", "estimated 30%"). Activity names altered (e.g., "Request Documents" vs. table/ground truth "Request_Documents"). Structure diverges (formatted memo vs. ground truth's concise #1-#3 list).

**Weighted total**: High fidelity on facts (80% weight) but strict losses on actions/prompt fidelity (-2.8 total).
