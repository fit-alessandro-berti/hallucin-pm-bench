9.5

- The LLM answer is correct and matches the ground truth in content and reasoning.
- The formatting differs slightly (the LLM restates the questions in its list, uses colons, and puts activities in bold and quotes, whereas the ground truth uses a more minimal format with asterisks and underscores).
- There is also a minimal stylistic redundancy in A1 (restating the case labels) and in A3 (briefly restating the question language rather than just the activity name).
- According to your instruction for utmost strictness and that even small errors should reflect in significant loss: While all information is correct, the answer is marginally less concise than the strict ground truth.
- Therefore, a slight penalty is applied for formatting and minimal verbosity, but the answer is otherwise perfect in substance.

Final score: 9.5
