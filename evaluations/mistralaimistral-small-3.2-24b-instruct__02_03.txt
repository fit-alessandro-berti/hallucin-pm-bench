7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (Distinct cases)**: Correct content (3 cases, lists them accurately). Minor differences in wording ("distinct" added, colon vs. parentheses) are small stylistic variances but acceptable for conciseness. No major deduction.
- **Q2 (Preceding activity for C456)**: Correct answer (Pack_Items), but the response includes unnecessary explanatory text ("For case **“C456”**, ... immediately precedes **“Ship_Order”**"), violating the "concise" instruction and diverging significantly from the ground truth's minimal "Pack_Items". Strict deduction for verbosity.
- **Q3 (Activity appearing once)**: Correct answer (Cancel_Order), but again includes extra phrasing ("appears exactly once in the fragment"), not matching the ground truth's brevity. Another deduction for lack of conciseness.
- **Overall**: Content accuracy is perfect (10/10), but format and conciseness issues (adding ~50% unnecessary words across Q2/Q3) reflect moderate adherence to prompt instructions. Strict scoring penalizes these as "small errors" per guidelines, leading to a 7.5 (high for correctness, reduced for presentation). Bullet-point structure is followed well.
