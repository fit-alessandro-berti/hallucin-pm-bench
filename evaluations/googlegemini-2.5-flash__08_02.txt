The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" to Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) as the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3 via the T7 path to P4/P5 while leaving P2 unmarked consumption by T3. The explanation accurately describes prerequisites and avoidance of T3, aligning closely with the ground truth's rationale. Minor deductions for lacking intermediate markings (which add precision in ground truth) and not noting T5's disabling effect on T3 afterward, though these are not strictly required by the prompt. Response is concise (under 120 words) and error-free.
