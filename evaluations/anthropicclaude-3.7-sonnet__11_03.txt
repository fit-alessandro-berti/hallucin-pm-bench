### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies the SLA excesses in absolute seconds (+300s for Legal and Risk, +60s for Credit), matching the ground truth. It adheres to the memo format, uses bullet points only for recommendations, and stays within ~150 words while grounding descriptions in table data (e.g., throughput and waiting times).

However, under strict evaluation:
- **Invented metrics (major deduction -2.0 points)**: The LLM introduces unprovided percentages (e.g., "100%" SLA excess for Risk Review, "67%" waiting as share of throughput), violating the instruction to avoid inventing metrics. The ground truth sticks strictly to absolutes without derivations.
- **Differences in structure and phrasing (moderate deduction -1.0 point)**: Header and subject vary (e.g., LLM's "Critical Process Bottlenecks" vs. ground truth's "Throughput Bottlenecks in Loan-Origination"); no total cases mentioned (ground truth specifies "4 805 completed cases," derivable from data); order of activities differs (Risk first vs. Legal first).
- **Recommendations (major deduction -1.5 points)**: Completely different from ground truthâ€”LLM's are generic and add unsubstantiated targets (e.g., "reduce waiting time to under 240 seconds," "reduce by at least 100 seconds"), while ground truth's are more tailored (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst"). Both invent details, but mismatch reduces alignment.
- **Minor issues (small deduction -0.5 point)**: No closing projection (ground truth estimates 35% cycle time reduction); phrasing like "severely underperforming" vs. "materially breach... largest queues" alters emphasis slightly.

Overall, core identification and quantification align (60-70% similarity), but inventions, mismatches, and deviations from ground truth phrasing/recommendations prevent a higher score.
