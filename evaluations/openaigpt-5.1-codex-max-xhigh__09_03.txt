**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth: both precisely explain the impossibility due to redacted rows/timestamps in the event log (Artefact A), explicitly reference the lack of start_time/complete_time data for “Approve Invoice,” cover all required metrics (average cycle time, std dev/95% CI via "statistical measures"/"dispersion or confidence interval"), and form a single short paragraph without guesses, tables, or extraneous content. Stylistic variations (e.g., "I cannot compute" vs. "Impossible"; no explicit "Artefact A" label; no suggestion of additional data) are negligible and do not alter correctness or fidelity under strict evaluation.
