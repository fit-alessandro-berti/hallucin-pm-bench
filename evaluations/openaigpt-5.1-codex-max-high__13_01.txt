**9.4**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1 (2.4/2.5)**: Exact match in content ("1 occurrence"). Minor phrasing difference (no backticks), but negligible.
- **Q2 (2.3/2.5)**: Correct calculation (1/18 = 5.56%). Minor formatting ("5.56%" vs. "5.56 %"); unnecessary but accurate addition of "(1 out of 18)" slightly deviates from ideal conciseness.
- **Q3 (2.1/2.5)**: Correct identifier (A1002). Significant phrasing shortfall: omits "only", bolding (**A1002**), and explicit "contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”" (question requires listing cases *that contain* it; response assumes context without restating).
- **Q4 (2.6/2.5)**: Exceeds by providing exactly two clear, matching reasons (small sample size with specifics like "18 events across 4 cases"; temporal bias as "single day"). Minor deduction for unlisted addition ("non-random", mild assumption) and not quantifying variance (±5.56 pp. as in GT small-sample example), but "any two" criterion met perfectly.

**Overall**: Excellent fidelity to log data (no hallucinations/inferences beyond log). Losses only for non-identical phrasing/formatting (strict per instructions: small errors = significant loss). Total differences minimal but present in precision/wording.
