The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the data provided. It references the lack of timestamps or elapsed-time information in the header, aligning with the ground truth answer's reasoning that calculation is impossible without temporal data. The answer avoids fabrication and clearly explains the limitation, matching both the content and rationale of the ground truth. No errors or omissions are present.
