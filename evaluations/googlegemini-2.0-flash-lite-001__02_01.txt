8.0

The LLM answer is almost perfect and matches the ground truth exactly except for Q5. It incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list, even though "Quality_Check" is the first event for case C-77 (so it should not be present in the list of activities that never appear as the first event). This is a significant accuracy error for Q5, which should result in a notable score reduction. The rest—Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4—are correct and match the ground truth precisely. Thus, a strict but fair score is 8.0.
