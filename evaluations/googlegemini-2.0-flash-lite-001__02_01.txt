The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1â€“Q4, demonstrating accurate extraction of distinct cases, preceding activity, earliest timestamp, and activity frequency. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list, as this activity does appear as the first event in case C-77. This is a clear factual error in interpretation of the log, violating the strict requirement to use only directly readable facts. Despite the error being confined to one extra list item (out of five total questions), the utmost strictness demands a significant deduction of 2.0 points for the incomplete accuracy in a multi-element response field.
