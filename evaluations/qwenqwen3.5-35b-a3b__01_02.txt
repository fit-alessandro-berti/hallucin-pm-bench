The LLM answer is semantically accurate and identifies the correct three decision points with proper flows, using exact terminology without introducing standard loan terms. It lists all required documents completely. However, under utmost strictness:

**Decision points differences (significant deductions):**
- Structure uses verbose "Condition"/"Flow" subheadings and extra explanatory phrases (e.g., "Compares risk scores from...", "Checks the loan amount requested against the €15 000 threshold"), not present in GT's concise inline format (-0.5).
- Specifies "continue to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check**" explicitly (accurate but added detail absent in GT's "continue;") (-0.3).
- Omits flow positions explicitly stated in GT (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") (-0.5).
- "> 2 points" vs GT's implicit "else"; minor rephrasing (-0.2).
- MBA "Condition" explicitly added; "proceed to" vs GT "send to"; lowercase/italicized "*approve* or *reject*" vs GT "**Approve** or **Reject**" (-0.3).

**Required documents differences (significant deductions):**
- Bullet list vs GT numbered list (-0.3).
- Phrasing variances in 3/6 items: "≤ 3 months old" vs "≤ 3 months" (+extra "old"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs "pay-stub/tax slip" (+extra "single", "or" vs "/"); "(CIS) template" vs "(CIS)" (+extra "template") (-0.9 total).
- Lacks GT's "(complete list)" header phrasing and emphatic note "*(No credit bureau report...)*" (-0.4).

Total deductions: -3.0 from 10.0. Content fidelity is high (~95% match), but strict textual/structural fidelity penalizes small variances heavily.
