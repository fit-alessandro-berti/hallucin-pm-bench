The LLM answer is factually perfect: correctly answers "No", identifies all four relevant cases (C001–C004), accurately describes each sequence around "Receive_Order" to "Validate_Payment", correctly flags C001/C003 as immediate (no intervening activities) and C002/C004 as non-immediate (Pack_Items/Check_Fraud intervene), and concludes inaccuracy due to "always" being violated in C002/C004. All sequences match the log's timestamps/order.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic/presentation differences vs. ground truth:
- Bullet-list format vs. table (less structured/compact).
- Non-sequential case order (C001 → C003 → C004 → C002, grouping "supports" then "contradicts" vs. chronological C001–C004).
- Slightly verbose sequences (includes post-Validate_Payment activities like Pack_Items/Ship_Order, though irrelevant but accurate) vs. ground truth's precise "around Receive_Order".
- Phrasing like "supports the claim"/"contradicts" vs. table's ✅/❌ + concise notes.

No factual/content errors; utmost strictness applied only to these superficial diffs.
