**6.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) – Major Errors (Severe Point Loss)**: 
  - Incorrectly identifies **3 decision points** instead of exactly **2** (ground truth: only the risk-based skip conditional and TriVote gate).
  - Falsely treats "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" (Step 3) as a "decision point," describing its output process rather than a rule/gate/branch; this is a hallucinated/inaccurate addition (Step 3 produces an input *for* the true conditional branch in Step 4).
  - Splits the risk conditional into two separate items, mismatching ground truth's consolidated "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check."
  - Minor wording diffs in TriVote (e.g., "affirmative votes" vs. precise "“Approve”"; "constitute approval" vs. "advance only when"), plus unnecessary step references and verbose formatting.
  - Result: ~60% accuracy (1/3 fabricated, structure/naming diverges significantly).

- **Part (b) – Perfect Match (Full Points)**: 
  - Exact list, order, and naming (9 items, including "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as distinct).
  - No extras/hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML). Descriptions/step refs are harmless additions but don't detract from core list.

- **Overall**: Part (b) flawless, but part (a)'s overcounting, misidentification, and mismatches are not "small errors"—they fundamentally misrepresent "every decision point," warranting >40% deduction under utmost strictness. No policy violations or unrelated issues.
