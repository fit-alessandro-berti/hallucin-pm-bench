**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: "1 time" aligns with "**1**"; minor wording ("time") acceptable for question phrasing. 10/10.
- **Q2a (near-perfect)**: "**2.08 %** of all events (1 ÷ 48 × 100)" matches "**2.08 %** (1 ÷ 48 events × 100)"; omits "events" in paren (small error). 9.5/10.
- **Q2b (near-perfect)**: "**8.33 %** ... (1 ÷ 12 × 100)" matches "**8.33 %** (1 ÷ 12 cases × 100)"; omits "cases" in paren (small error). 9.5/10.
- **Q3 (good content, major violations)**: Covers required elements—(i) single occurrence ("only one occurrence", "single instance"); (ii) instability/variance ("overfitting ... single instance", "hide ... impact", "discard ... low support", "spurious correlation", "fragile"); (iii) over-generalisation ("Generalising from this slice risks", "fragile process insights"). However: (a) **exceeds ≤100 words** (~118 words, +18% over); (b) **invents info** ("full log contains more manual checks"—violates "only use the log; do not invent"); (c) redundant % repeats; (d) speculative risks (e.g., "compliance step", "fraud-risk indicators") not grounded solely in log. 5.5/10.
- **Overall**: Weighted average (equal per question) = 8.625 → 8.2 (strict deduction for violations per instructions; small errors like paren omissions -0.5 each, word/invent -2.5 total on Q3). Structure/formatting minor diffs ignored as content-focused.
