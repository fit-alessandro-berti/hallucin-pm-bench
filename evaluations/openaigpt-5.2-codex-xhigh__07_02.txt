**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (full credit areas)**: 
  - Correctly identifies *all* added tasks (3 exact names), removed task (1 exact name), and the sole gateway change. No factual errors, hallucinations, or missed changes. Ignores cosmetics (e.g., name changes on existing tasks like "Review Application", "Approve Loan"; gateway name).
  - Headings match the prompt *exactly*, including "(e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)" on the third (GT shortens it).
  - Gateway description precisely uses XML tag names (`ExclusiveGateway` → `InclusiveGateway`), aligning with BPMN XML fidelity.

- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences vs. GT; strict per instructions)**:
  - **Missing IDs** (-1.5 total): GT includes precise `(`id`)` for *every* task (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity`), essential for meticulous BPMN analysis (IDs uniquely identify elements). LLM omits all 4 (3 added + 1 removed), reducing precision/traceability. Significant loss as this is not cosmetic.
  - **Formatting/structure differences** (-0.3): Bullets vs. GT's numbering (1., 2., 3.); no final confirmatory note ("No other..."). Minor but strict deduction.
  - **Gateway phrasing** (-0.2): LLM omits explicit "in *v1* to *v2*" and semantic XOR/OR (GT includes); uses tags/abbrev instead. Accurate but diverges in detail/wording.
  
Overall: Substance 95% match, but precision omissions (IDs) warrant major deduction despite no content errors. 10.0 requires near-verbatim match to GT.
