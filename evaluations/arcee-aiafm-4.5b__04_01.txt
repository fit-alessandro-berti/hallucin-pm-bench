3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Compliance Verdict (Major Error, -4.0 points)**: The LLM incorrectly concludes "Compliant," directly contradicting the ground truth's "Non-compliant." This is a critical failure, as the trace violates Rules 2 and 3, making the verdict invalid. Strict deduction for reversing the core outcome.
- **Rule 1 Justification (Accurate, +1.0 point)**: Matches ground truth—correctly identifies the two approvals before `Issue_PO` for the high-value PO. No errors.
- **Rule 2 Justification (Inaccurate, -1.5 points)**: Fails to detect the violation; claims `Risk_Assessment` precedes `Ship_Goods` but ignores the reversed order (event 9 after event 8). Also erroneously mentions "Quality_Check becomes optional (Breached rule 3)," confusing it with Rule 3 and introducing a non-issue (no `Quality_Check` appears anyway). Significant factual error.
- **Rule 3 Justification (Inaccurate, -1.5 points)**: Wrongly states `Three_way_match` occurs "within one activity" after `Goods_Received` (actual distance is 4 events: 7, 8, 9, 10; exceeds ≤2 limit). Miscalculates sequence entirely, missing the violation.
- **Rule 4 Justification (Mostly Accurate but Flawed, +0.5 point)**: Correctly concludes no direct Intern follow after CFO (event 7 follows event 6 by Warehouse_Clerk). However, description is imprecise—CFO is only at event 3, and confuses Intern's role (event 8 is Logistics, not Intern). Minor wording issues but core logic holds.
- **Rule 5 Justification (Accurate, +1.0 point)**: Matches ground truth—trace ends with `Archive_Record` at event 11, nothing after.
- **Structure and Format (Partial Credit, +0.5 point)**: Uses a numbered justification format similar to ground truth, citing rules and events. However, adds extraneous "Final answer: Compliant" repetition and lacks the ground truth's clear summary of violations leading to non-compliance.
- **Additional Penalties (-0.5 point)**: Small errors like referencing non-existent breaches (e.g., tying Expedite_Flag to Rule 3) and incomplete trace analysis (ignores `Move_to_Quality` relevance) compound issues under strict criteria.

Total base: Starts at 10.0, deducts for mismatches (net ~ -6.5 from errors). The LLM captures the audit structure but fundamentally misreads key rule violations, warranting a low score for accuracy against ground truth.
