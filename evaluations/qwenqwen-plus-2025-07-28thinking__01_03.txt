3.5

### Rationale

#### a) Decision Points

- The LLM correctly identifies the two core decision points (risk-based conditional skip and TriVote gate) and provides generally accurate one-sentence rules for each.  
- Its wording is a little less direct than the ground truth (e.g., saying "a single rejection fails the gate" may imply all three must approve, while the decision rule is that any two approvals are sufficient—its text elsewhere notes this, so only a minor clarity error).

#### b) Required Documents

**This section contains major errors:**

- The LLM omits documents that are explicitly named in the process as required:
    - **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** are not included in the LLM's list, even though they are listed as inputs in Step 3. The ground truth clearly shows all three as required, and the prompt is explicit that these are "Documents."
- The LLM merges "Offer Sheet 77" and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" into a single entry. They are different artifacts at different process steps; the ground truth lists both for a reason.
- The ordering is incorrect because of the aforementioned omissions (documents are skipped and thus subsequent entries are out of place).
- The LLM does recognize that "Deck Memo" is conditional, which is a plus, but it still misses unconditional documents.
- The LLM provides clarifications, e.g., that Scorecards are not applicant-submitted documents, but this is not supported by the process description, which simply lists them as "Documents."
- The full set of 9 documents required in the ground truth is not present; instead only 5 are listed, with key omissions.

### Summary:
- **Minor deduction** for slightly ambiguous language in the TriVote decision point.
- **Major deduction** for the incomplete, incorrect, and partially mischaracterized document list (missing required documents, incorrect lumping, and order errors).

### Score rationale:
- Because the document-listing portion of the answer contains impactful errors relative to what the prompt expects and the ground truth supplies, and because the decision point summary is accurate but not word-perfect, a strict grading rubric must reward only partial credit: **3.5/10**.
