4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Part (a) Accuracy (Decision Points)**: 9.5/10. The LLM correctly identifies and describes the two decision points with precise rules matching the ground truth in essence and detail (e.g., conditional skip logic and TriVote threshold). Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., "grant approval" vs. "record 'Approve'" and added "if and only if" phrasing, which is accurate but not verbatim) and for labeling them by step numbers instead of descriptive titles, but these are negligible under strict scrutiny.
  
- **Part (b) Accuracy (Documents List)**: 2.0/10. Severe deficiencies: Omits the three Scorecard inputs (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) entirely, despite their explicit mention as required inputs in Step 3 and inclusion in ground truth as documents in first-appearance order. Fails to list "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate item (Step 8 specifies it distinctly from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in Step 7). Results in only 5 items vs. ground truth's 9, disrupting order and completeness. The LLM's rationale (e.g., Scorecards as "internal data sources, not applicant-submitted documents") hallucinates a distinction not supported by the prompt, which simply asks for "all documents...required anywhere." Conditional note on Deck Memo is accurate but insufficient to offset omissions. No hallucinated KYC/AML mentions, which avoids further penalty.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: The response is well-formatted and verified against the process, but the critical errors in completeness and interpretation of "documents" in part (b) dominate, as per strict evaluation criteria emphasizing differences from ground truth. Total reflects strong part (a) buoyed by a flawed part (b), with no leniency for partial credits on missed items.
