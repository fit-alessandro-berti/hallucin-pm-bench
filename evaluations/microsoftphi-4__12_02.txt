The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides proper justification by identifying case C003 (lines 6 and 7) as a counterexample, closely matching the gold standard. It also accurately references line numbers and case-ids, and argues that a single counterexample is sufficient.

However, it fails to mention the additional counterexample present in case C005, where *Validate_Payment* occurs (line 11) but *Receive_Order* never appears at all. The omission of this case is a significant oversight, since the ground truth expects all such cases to be cited. According to the instruction to be “utmost strict,” missing any clear counterexample is a notable error that results in a substantial deduction, even if one (C003) is analyzed thoroughly. Thus, while the answer is mostly correct and well explained, the omitted evidence reduces its score considerably.
