The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid counterexample from case C003 (lines 6-7), which aligns partially with the ground truth. However, it significantly errs by omitting the critical counterexample in case C005 (line 11), where Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order, directly contradicting the "always follows" claim. Worse, it factually misstates that Validate_Payment follows Receive_Order in C005, which is incorrect as no Receive_Order exists for that case. This incompleteness and inaccuracy represent major deviations from the ground truth's comprehensive justification, warranting substantial point deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
