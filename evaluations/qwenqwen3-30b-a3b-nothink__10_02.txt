3.0

**Justification for Strict Score:**

### Severe Issues and Deductions:
- **Did not strictly adhere to the mandated vocabulary for roles.** The table in the LLM answer still uses "Payment Clerk" and "Compliance Officer" instead of strictly using "Transaction Analyst" and "Regulatory Liaison" in all task rows as mandated. This is a major error.
- **Accountable role assignment is wrong/unclear:** The LLM answer wrongly says "Compliance Officer" (for whom there is a strict vocabulary ban) is accountable for nearly every step, rather than introducing an "Operations Manager" to match the ground truth.
- **Task wording not aligned:** Tasks like “Receive and log customer transfer instruction” are not mapped to the phrase “Receive Payment Instruction,” and others deviate from the standard/mandated naming from the ground truth.
- **Omission of a required stakeholder:** The ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a required role in the RACI, whereas the LLM answer omits this role entirely.
- **Incorrect RACI assignments:** For example, KYC Review is performed by the “Regulatory Liaison” (correct), but in the LLM answer, there are major mismatches in who is marked as accountable and the mapping of C/I/A/R is inconsistent with the ground truth.

### Minor but Notable Issues:
- **Table Organization:** The LLM answer does not exactly follow the expected structure (labels, mandated naming).
- **Does not clarify mapping:** No legend is provided and “mandated wording” is not emphasized in the activity/task column as requested.

### Summary:
Because there are fundamental vocabulary violations, assignment errors, and mapping mismatches, this answer falls *far* short of strict process documentation standards. The only reason it receives a 3 and not lower: it at least partially attempts to use the correct mandated terms in activities, does include a RACI format, and provides an answer in Markdown.

**Overall: 3.0/10.0**
