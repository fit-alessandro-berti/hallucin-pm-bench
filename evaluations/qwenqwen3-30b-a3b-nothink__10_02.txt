3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment based on differences from the ground truth answer. The LLM answer attempts a RACI table and covers most source tasks, but it incurs major penalties for vocabulary violations, structural mismatches, incomplete/inaccurate role assignments, and extraneous additions. Key issues:

- **Vocabulary Mandate Violations (-2.5 points)**: The prompt strictly requires using only "KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", and "Transaction Analyst". The LLM uses forbidden terms like "Payment Clerk" (twice) and "Compliance Officer" (pervasively as Accountable). It correctly uses "KYC Review" once and "Transaction Analyst" once, but this is insufficient to offset the breaches. Ground truth adheres perfectly, bolding "**KYC Review**" in the task row.

- **Table Structure and Format (-2.0 points)**: Ground truth uses rows for tasks (with mandated wording) and columns for roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support), with bolded **R/A/C/I** abbreviations and a legend. The LLM inverts this (R/A/C/I columns, tasks as rows) and uses full words or "-" instead of abbreviations, lacking the legend. This deviates significantly from the ground truth's clear, mandated organization.

- **Task Coverage and Wording (-1.5 points)**: LLM covers 8 tasks, expanding the source's 6 steps (e.g., separate "Send SWIFT message" and adds "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case closure"). Ground truth consolidates into 6 precise tasks (e.g., no separate SWIFT or notify; "Archive Record" instead of "Archive case file"). LLM's tasks are close but not exact (e.g., "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; misses bolding/mandated phrasing like "**KYC Review**").

- **Role Assignments and RACI Logic (-1.5 points)**: Assignments rarely align. For example:
  - Receive: LLM has Transaction Analyst equivalent as "Payment Clerk" (R), but wrong Accountable ("Compliance Officer" vs. ground truth's Operations Manager A, Transaction Analyst R).
  - KYC Review: LLM assigns Regulatory Liaison (R) correctly in role but wrong Accountable; ground truth has Regulatory Liaison R/A, with C/I for others.
  - Approve: Similar mismatches.
  - Archive: LLM has IT Support (R/A), but ground truth has IT Support R, Operations Manager A.
  - No "Operations Manager" in LLM, and Consulted/Informed are mostly blank ("-") vs. ground truth's populated C/I (e.g., IT Support C for screening).
  This shows poor mapping to source and ground truth logic.

The LLM shows basic effort (Markdown table, partial mandated terms) but fails core requirements, justifying a low score. With utmost strictness, even partial adherence doesn't exceed 3.5.
