4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates a partial adaptation of the vocabulary policy and process narrative but contains several significant errors and deviations from the ground truth. Here is a breakdown justifying the score:

**Strengths:**
- All four required terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) are present as standalone activities, without forbidden synonyms leaking into the main table.
- No alternative phrasings or synonyms appear for the four mandated activities in column headers or activity descriptions.

**Errors and Deviations (with significant penalty for each):**
1. **Incorrect Activity List:**
   - The LLM answer introduces noncanonical activities: "Approval (for scores exceeding 70)", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release and Notification" instead of the required "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds".
   - The required format is to use only the six activities from the ground truth answer, not additional subdivisions or alternative names.

2. **Incorrect Role Assignment:**
   - Does not follow the ground truth's explicit matrix structure mapping the four roles as columns and six canonical activities as rows.
   - LLM populates "Responsible", "Accountable", "Consulted", "Informed" as columns, which is a shift from the ground truth format (roles as columns, not RACI functions).
   - Roles are sometimes assigned “Accountable” for activities where, per ground truth, “Accountable” should be marked differently (e.g., "Intake Vetting": only Front-Office Analyst should be R/A, but LLM only lists "Responsible" and "Accountable" as Front-Office Analyst, with no "Consulted" or "Informed").

3. **Inaccurate Involvement:**
   - Fails to mark the correct roles as Consulted (C) or Informed (I) in several rows; e.g., Treasury Ops should be "Informed" for multiple activities but is often omitted or moved around.
   - Overuses dash (-) instead of correctly identifying "Consulted" and "Informed" roles.

4. **Format Noncompliance:**
   - Ignores instruction: “Return the matrix as a Markdown table; do not rename, merge, or add activities.”
   - Modifies activity names in some cases (e.g., "Fund Release and Notification") and splits/moves steps outside canonical ground truth.

5. **Legend Issues:**
   - Includes an unnecessary note block after the table, which was not present in the ground truth.

Because of these substantial issues in activity scope, matrix format, assignment accuracy, and role marking—each warranting deductions—the score reflects a significant departure from the ground truth despite broad adherence to vocabulary.
