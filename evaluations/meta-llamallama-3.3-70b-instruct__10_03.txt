### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as required, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms. This is a strict policy adherence and warrants some points. However, added activities use non-mandated names like "Approval (for scores exceeding 70)", "Payment Scheduling", and "Fund Release and Notification", which violate the "do not rename, merge, or add activities" instruction by introducing unauthorized phrasings.
  
- **Table Format and Structure (-Major Deduction)**: The prompt requests a RACI matrix as a Markdown table covering every activity and role, but the LLM uses a non-standard transposed format (columns for R/A/C/I, activities in rows), which obscures role-based accountability and differs fundamentally from the ground truth's role-columns format (standard for RACI matrices). This is a significant structural error, leading to substantial point loss under strict evaluation.

- **Activities Coverage (-Major Deduction)**: The LLM covers the four core activities but adds three extras ("Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release and Notification"), violating "do not add activities". The ground truth adds only two inferred ones ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds") without merging or over-expanding. The LLM's additions rename and split the narrative's implied "escalate for approval", "schedule the payment", and "releases the funds and notifies" inaccurately (e.g., separating scheduling from release, adding parenthetical details).

- **RACI Assignments (-Major Deduction)**: Assignments diverge widely from the ground truth across nearly all activities, indicating misinterpretation of the process narrative:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM omits Consulted (Compliance Analyst) and Informed (Treasury Ops); ground truth includes them.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: LLM assigns only Responsible (Compliance Analyst) and Accountable (Compliance Officer), missing Responsible/Accountable dual for Analyst, Consulted (Officer), and Informed (Treasury Ops) per ground truth.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM misses Consulted (Front-Office Analyst) and Informed (Treasury Ops).
  - **Approval**: LLM's version adds extras; assignments mismatch (e.g., Consulted Front-Office as C vs. ground truth I; Informed Treasury Ops vs. none).
  - Added "Payment Scheduling" and "Fund Release and Notification" have no ground truth equivalents, but even mapped roughly to "Release Funds", assignments differ (e.g., LLM's Accountable as Officer for all vs. ground truth Treasury Ops R/A; missing Consulted for Officer; Informed mismatches).
  These are not minor; they alter accountability (e.g., over-attributing to Officer) and ignore narrative flows like notifications to "originating analyst" (implying Front-Office Informed).

- **Extra Content (-Minor Deduction)**: Unrequested title ("### RACI Matrix for NimbusPay Process") and explanatory note add verbosity not in the ground truth or prompt, diluting focus.

- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the LLM shows partial adherence to vocabulary but fails on format, activity fidelity, and ~70% of assignments (per-cell comparison). This reflects significant deviations from the ground truth, justifying a low score. No partial credit for intent, as small errors (e.g., missing I/C entries) compound into process inaccuracies.
