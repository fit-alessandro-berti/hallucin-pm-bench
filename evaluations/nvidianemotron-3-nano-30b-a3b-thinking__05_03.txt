**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major functional difference (-3.0)**: LLM routes timeout to `End_Rejected` (simple rejection), ignoring the BPMN context's explicit unused *escalation activity* (`Activity_AMReview`) and missing the "escalation path" intent; ground truth correctly connects to `Activity_AMReview` for escalation before activation.
- **XML validity error (-2.0)**: Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (required for BPMN 2.0 schema compliance; original model uses it elsewhere), rendering LLM XML invalid; ground truth is correct.
- **Minor XML differences (-1.0)**: Different IDs (`Boundary_Timer_CreateAccount` vs `Boundary_LateCreate`), missing `name="48h breach"`, different flow ID and structure (no comments/❶❷❷).
- **Justification mismatch (-0.5)**: Describes rejection path instead of escalation to pre-existing review task.
- **Partial credit (+2.0 base)**: Correctly identifies interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount`, `cancelActivity="true"`, `PT48H` duration (aligns with SLA timing post-Verify Identity), no new activities added.

Total reflects high strictness: ~65% mismatch in core elements/outcome, significant errors in correctness and intent.
