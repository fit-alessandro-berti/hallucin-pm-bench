**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (major failures, ~20% alignment)**: Ground truth identifies *exactly* 2 decision points/gates: (1) the post-Tri-Color conditional skip (precise rule matched in LLM's #3), (2) TriVote (rule mostly matched, but LLM incorrectly states "requires at least two" without noting the process's "any two suffice to pass"; minor phrasing nit). LLM fabricates 3 extra non-decisions (#1 Receive-Application, #2 Tri-Color-Risk-Check as "decision", #4 Manual-Underwriting-Review), violating "every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch)". Wrong count (5 vs. 2) and misclassification = catastrophic error; no credit for extras.
- **Part (b) - Documents (major omissions/inaccuracies, ~40% alignment)**: Ground truth lists 9 docs in precise first-appearance order. LLM lists only 5, **missing entirely**: Scorecard–Cyan/Magenta/Yellow (step 3 inputs, explicit "required anywhere"); Signed Offer Sheet 77 (distinct from unsigned in step 8). Order disrupted by misses. Minor: LLM notes KYC outsourcing (neutral, matches process note); groups Signed/ID vaguely in parenthetical but omits from list. ~4/9 correct but incomplete/inaccurate.
- **Overall**: Prompt demands *exact* process fidelity; LLM hallucinates decisions, omits core docs (scorecards are unambiguous "Inputs"), adds fluff ("Certainly!", offer for details). Strictness deducts heavily for small (phrasing) + large (omissions/hallucinations) errors: partial credit for core skip/TriVote/docs only. No perfect match = low score.
