The LLM answer identifies the correct factual changes (added: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway: gw_valid type change from exclusive to inclusive). However, it violates multiple strict requirements: excessive speculative/explanatory text (e.g., step-by-step comparison, "Other Changes" section mentioning sequence flows, summary preamble) instead of listing *only* factual differences; incorrect listing format (uses plain ids without names or parenthetical ids as in ground truth, no bolding for types, inconsistent bullets vs. asterisks); headings prefixed with bullets and bolded inconsistently; no explicit v1/v2 versioning in gateway change; omission of the "(No other differences should be reported.)" note or equivalent. These deviations, even if minor individually, compound to significant non-compliance under strict evaluation.
