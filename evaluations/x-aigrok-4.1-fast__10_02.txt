**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Structural differences (major deductions: -4.0 points)**: LLM uses 3 columns (missing "Operations Manager" entirely, a core column in GT). 7 tasks vs. GT's 6. No "Legend", no bolding (**R**, **A**, etc.), different header ("Task" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"). Dashes ("-") for blanks vs. GT's explicit letters in most cells.
- **Task wording mismatches (significant deductions: -2.0 points)**: Not identical to GT (e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. "**KYC Review**"; extra "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" not in GT; "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record"). Small wording variances penalized heavily per instructions.
- **RACI assignments (total mismatch: -2.0 points)**: No task fully matches GT across columns (e.g., KYC: partial C/R but missing A/I; Approve uses invalid "A/R" combo; all others differ due to missing column and wrong letters like Release missing A/C).
- **Partial positives (no addition)**: Uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", etc.) correctly, Markdown table, covers source steps—but overwhelmed by diffs vs. GT.

Overall: ~80% divergence; strictness demands minimal score for such variances.
