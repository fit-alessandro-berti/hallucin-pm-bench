**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM includes the Tri-Color-Risk-Check as a decision point, which is not a gate or conditional branch—it's a scoring/assignment step. The first *actual* decision point per the ground truth is the branch after this check, not the check itself. This is a notable error.
- The LLM otherwise correctly describes the conditional skip based on risk/amount, and the TriVote approval rule, mostly matching the ground truth's formulations.
- The rule for TriVote is described with slightly different wording—"to pass" versus "may advance only when..."—but the logic is essentially correctly captured.
- The LLM omits mention that “Sustainability Officer” is always present, though this is only a context detail, not asked directly.

**b) List of documents**

- The LLM lists "Scorecard–Cyan", "Scorecard–Magenta", and "Scorecard–Yellow" as separate documents, which matches the ground truth list.
- It omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate required document. This is **significant**, as it is explicitly called for at step 8 and included in the ground truth, but not in the LLM's list.
- All other documents match and are in the correct order.

**Additional Observations:**

- The LLM sensibly notes that scorecards are included since they're referenced as documents required "anywhere" in the process.
- No hallucated documents (KYC, credit-bureau, AML) are present, a positive.

**Score rationale:**

- Severe point deduction for wrongly including the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself as a gate (when it's an assignment step).
- Major deduction for omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77".
- Minor deductions for less precise wording in the gates and not stating that the outcome of TriVote is "may advance only when..." (although this is more stylistic than substantive).

**Overall:** Accurate on most substance, but the above errors constitute meaningful departures under strict grading.
