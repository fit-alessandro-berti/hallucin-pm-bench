### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM correctly identifies and summarizes the two actual decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote gate) with mostly accurate phrasing, closely aligning with the ground truth's rules and structure (e.g., "Low or Medium and ≤ €250,000" for the skip; "at least two out of three" for TriVote). However, it incorrectly adds a third "decision point" for the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself, which is merely a step producing an output (not a gate or branch), introducing an extraneous and inaccurate element that dilutes the summary and deviates from the ground truth's exact two points. This is a notable error under strict criteria, as it misinterprets what constitutes a "decision point." Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "to pass" vs. "record 'Approve'"; no explicit "bypasses ... otherwise proceeds") are not severe but contribute to a partial deduction.
  
- **Part (b)**: The list captures 8 of the 9 required documents in correct first-appearance order, with appropriate inclusions (e.g., scorecards as inputs, Deck Memo as conditional). However, it fails to list "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document (per step 8), instead folding it into the description of "Offer Sheet 77" (step 7), which treats the signed version as non-separate and omits it from the enumerated list—directly contradicting the ground truth's explicit separation. The added explanatory notes and caveat about scorecards are unnecessary fluff not present in the ground truth, further indicating over-interpretation. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML inventions), which avoids worse penalties.

Overall, the response is substantially accurate but undermined by the added spurious decision point and omission of one key document, warranting a mid-range score with deductions for these core mismatches despite strong alignment on the main content.
