The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth in all deterministic numeric elements (Q1: 1; Q2a: 2.08%; Q2b: 8.33%) with exact calculations and rounding. For Q3, the explanation adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (68 words), explicitly addresses single-occurrence (i), notes instability/variance via "insufficient data," "lack of statistical significance," and "overfitting," and cautions against over-generalization via "misrepresenting true process behavior" and "incorrectly identify patterns." No inventions, deviations, or errors; fully data-driven and comprehensive.
