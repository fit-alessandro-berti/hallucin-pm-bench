The LLM answer is overall correct and demonstrates a clear understanding of the limitations presented by the artefacts: it repeatedly and rightly points out the lack of timestamp data, explicitly states that no time-based metrics can be computed, and refrains from guessing or supplementing with external knowledge. It also briefly discusses why the corporate SLA information cannot help with the computation.

However, points are deducted for verbosity and indirectness compared to the ground truth. The LLM answer uses more words, structures the answer as if responding to three subquestions (rather than just giving a direct, single-paragraph answer), and slightly dilutes its emphasis with phrases like "Based on the artefacts provided, the following conclusions can be drawn," which are not necessary. The ground truth is stricter and more concise, focusing razor-sharp on the absence of required data and explicitly referencing the required fields (start_time / complete_time).

Although the content is fundamentally correct, the LLM answer loses 2 points for less concise structure and a little mild repetition, which reduces its precision compared to the ground truth.
