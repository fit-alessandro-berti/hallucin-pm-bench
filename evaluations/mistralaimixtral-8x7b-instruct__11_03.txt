4.2

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Correct identification of three worst activities (jointly SLA breach + high wait)**: Matches ground truth (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment). +2.0
- **Quantification of SLA exceedance**: Legal (+300s) and Credit (+60s) correct; Risk Review wrong (200s vs. actual 300s, 600-300=300). Major data error, ungrounded. -2.5
- **Recommendations**: One per activity, concrete – partial credit; but not data-driven (generic, no table metrics used, e.g., no case volumes, times); not in "**bullet points only**" (inline numbered list instead of separate bulleted section). Violates instruction 3. -2.0
- **Structure/Format**: Memo-like but adds unrequested greeting/signature/closing ("Dear COO", "Best regards"); no "To/From/Subject" match; intro not grounded in total cases (4805 implied sum); extra conversions (minutes) not in data. Violates "ground every sentence" and "ONLY the memo text". -1.5
- **Length/Style**: ~150 words ok; executive tone ok. +0.2
- **Overall strictness**: Significant deviations in accuracy, structure, and grounding; small errors (e.g., order, extras) compound to major loss. Total reflects ~42% alignment.
