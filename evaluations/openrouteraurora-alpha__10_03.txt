**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, +3.0 base)**: All four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") used exactly; no leaks of disallowed synonyms. This is the *only* fully correct aspect.
- **Coverage of activities (major failure, -4.0)**: Prompt requires matrix "covering **every activity** described"; narrative explicitly includes Compliance Officer approval (escalation if score >70) and Treasury Ops release/schedule funds (post-approval). LLM omits both (4 rows vs. ground truth's 6), violating completeness. "Do not add" does not excuse omission—activities must be derived/represented without renaming mandated ones.
- **RACI assignments (multiple errors, -2.5)**: 
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Comp Analyst: I vs. C; CO: I vs. – |
  | KYC Review | Front: I vs. – |
  | AML Screening | Front: I vs. – |
  | Risk Scoring | Front: I vs. C; Comp Analyst: R/A vs. R; CO: C vs. A |
  - ~60% of cells differ; ignores nuances like – (no involvement) vs. I/C.
- **Formatting/Structure (minor errors, -0.5)**: Markdown table present, but R/A slash vs. **R, A** bold comma; unnecessary **RACI Matrix** header; non-standard hyphen in "Front‑Office"; no *Key points* equivalent.
- **Overall**: Partial credit for vocab/table skeleton, but incompleteness and pervasive mismatches make it unusable vs. ground truth. Strictness demands heavy penalties for gaps/omissions.
