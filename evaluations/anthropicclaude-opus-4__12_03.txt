The LLM answer correctly states "**No**" and justifies the choice by analyzing each relevant case (C001â€“C004). It clearly points out in C002 and C004 that other activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," directly contradicting the FACT. The answer lists the cases, the observed sequences, and provides a clear explanation.

However, there are minor omissions compared to the ground truth:

- The LLM does not use a tabular or side-by-side structure that the ground truth provides, which more clearly demonstrates case-by-case analysis.
- The LLM says "In 2 out of 4 cases," which is correct, but the ground truth emphasizes this contrast with a summary table and a final statement reinforcing the failure of the "always" claim.
- The LLM does not explicitly mention the "Immediate successor? Yes/No" per case, missing some analytical clarity.
- The LLM does not repeat the explicit wording of the claim ("Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order") in the conclusion.

These are small but meaningful differences in structure, explicitness, and rigor, meriting a deduction. The logic and evidence are otherwise sound.
