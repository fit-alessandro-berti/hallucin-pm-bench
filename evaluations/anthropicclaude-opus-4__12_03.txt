The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in answering "No" and correctly identifying the violating cases (C002 with Pack_Items intervening; C004 with Check_Fraud intervening) while confirming the compliant cases (C001 and C003). It justifies with relevant CaseIDs and sequences, as required. Minor stylistic differences (numbered list vs. table; inclusion of timestamps, which are accurate but extraneous) do not introduce errors or omissions, so no point deduction is warranted under strict evaluation.
