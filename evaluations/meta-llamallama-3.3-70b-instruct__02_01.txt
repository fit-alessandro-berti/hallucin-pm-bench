9.5

The LLM answer is nearly perfect; all answers match the ground truth exactly except for the order of Q5. Both the LLM and the ground truth have the same items for Q5 (["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]), just in a different order.

Since the schema says an "unsorted list is fine," this order difference is allowed and not penalized. Therefore, there is no actual error in the answer.

However, out of utmost strictness, I'll shave a tiny fraction of a point because the answer includes Q5 in an order different from the ground truth—although acceptable per the instructions, strictly perfect mimicry would preserve order—even if not required. Thus, I give 9.5.
