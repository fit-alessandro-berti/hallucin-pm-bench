The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" as the response and pinpoints the two counterexample cases (C003 and C005) with mostly accurate line citations for C003, but commits a major factual error in C005 by hallucinating a "Receive_Order at line 11" (actual line 11 is only Validate_Payment for C005, with no Receive_Order anywhere in that case), failing to note the absence of Receive_Order as the ground truth does. This distorts the justification, incorrectly implying co-occurrence rather than lack of predecessor. Format deviates from "**No**" standalone followed by one paragraph (integrates extra phrasing like "the stated fact is not accurate"), and the reasoning is less precise ("does not follow" vaguely for C005 vs. ground truth's clear "never contains"). Under utmost strictness, these errors (factual inaccuracy in log citation, imprecise structure, incomplete logic) warrant significant deduction despite correct overall verdict.
