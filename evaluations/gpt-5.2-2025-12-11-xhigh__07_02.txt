9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (full credit for core content)**: Correctly identifies *all* changes: 3 added tasks (exact matches), 1 removed task (exact match), 1 gateway-type change (exclusive to inclusive, matching prompt example style). Ignores renamings (e.g., task/gateway names), flows, cosmetics perfectly. Grouped under *exactly* the required headings.
- **Deductions (-1.0 total for small strictness errors)**:
  - List format: Bullets (`-`) vs numbered (`1.`) (-0.3).
  - Item presentation: ID-first with quotes (`ID` (“Name”)) vs name-first bold with ID backticks (**Name** (`ID`)) – reversed order (-0.3).
  - Gateway wording: XML tags (`exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway`) vs descriptive with versions/abbrevs ("exclusive (XOR) in v1 to inclusive (OR) in v2") (-0.2).
  - Minor: Headings use `##` vs `* **bold**`; no final note; no escaped `_` in ID (-0.2 cumulative).
- Overall: Semantically perfect (10.0 base), but strict textual/presentation diffs prevent max score. No major errors/misses.
