The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in content, structure, and evidence, correctly identifying the "No" verdict and citing the exact counterexamples from C003 (lines 6 and 7) and C005 (line 11 without Receive_Order). It adheres to the required format of a single "No" followed by one justifying paragraph with line numbers and case-IDs. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "without any Receive_Order event whatsoever" vs. "never contains Receive_Order at all," and lack of bullet points or bolding, which the ground truth uses but the prompt does not mandate) and not including an explicit concluding sentence restating the "always" violation, though these are stylistic rather than substantive errors.
