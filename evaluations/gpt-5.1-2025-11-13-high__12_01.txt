10.0

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in verdict, structure, coverage of all cases, factual accuracy, and direct addressing of the claim's key elements (ordering reversal, absence in Case 1002, and lack of immediate precedence). It cites case IDs and activities as required, with no errors, omissions, or deviations—only minor stylistic differences (e.g., sequence arrows vs. line references) that do not impact correctness or completeness.
