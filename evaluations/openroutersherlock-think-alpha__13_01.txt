8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer against the ground truth with utmost strictness, penalizing even minor deviations in phrasing, completeness, formatting, or exactness. The ground truth emphasizes direct derivation from the log without inference, precise wording (e.g., including units like "%" or explanatory phrases), and clear statement of reasons in Q4. Total score reflects near-exact matches in content but deductions for small formatting/phrasing omissions that alter fidelity.

- **Q1 (weight: ~25%)**: LLM says "1", ground truth "1 occurrence". Minor omission of "occurrence" (reduces clarity). Deduction: -0.5. Partial score: 2.25/2.5.
- **Q2 (weight: ~25%)**: LLM says "5.56", ground truth "5.56 %" with explicit "%" and calculation note. Omission of "%" violates the question's "percentage" requirement and ground truth formatting; no calculation shown. Significant error per strictness rule. Deduction: -1.0. Partial score: 1.5/2.5.
- **Q3 (weight: ~25%)**: LLM says "A1002", ground truth "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”." Correct identifier but omits "Only case", bolding, and full explanatory phrasing, making it less precise and emphatic. Minor but notable deviation. Deduction: -0.5. Partial score: 2.25/2.5.
- **Q4 (weight: ~25%)**: LLM provides two clear, relevant reasons (small sample size with specifics; temporal bias with single-day span and monthly representativeness). Matches two ground truth options (small sample size; temporal bias) without hallucination or unjustified inference. Phrasing is strong and directly tied to the fragment. No deduction. Partial score: 2.5/2.5.

**Total**: 8.5/10, rounded down to 8.0 for cumulative small errors compounding to reduce overall fidelity (e.g., answers feel truncated/incomplete vs. ground truth's polished, explanatory style). The LLM adheres to the system prompt (no inferences beyond logs) but lacks the ground truth's exactness.
