The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and notes the absence of "Update_Inventory" in Case 1002, but it contains critical factual errors in describing the activity sequences for Cases 1001 and 1003 (e.g., incorrectly reversing the order of "Update_Inventory" and "Authorize_Refund" in both, and misstating the predecessor of "Authorize_Refund" in Case 1003). These errors undermine the justification's reliability, deviating substantially from the ground truth's precise, evidence-based analysis, despite the shared overall verdict.
