8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities by waiting time and ranks them appropriately. It accurately quotes both the average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each. Each activity is paired with a concrete, data-driven action aimed at reducing waiting time by ≥ 20%, and word count fits the limit.

**Point deductions and issues:**

- The recommendations, while plausible, are not as tightly aligned with the data/ground truth actions (“automated e-document requests” vs. “automated customer reminders with escalation triggers”, “instant digital closure letters via portal” vs. “same-day e-signature letters generated on claim closure”, “parallel assessment workflow using AI triage” vs. “rules-engine pre-classification for adjuster bypass”). Each differs meaningfully in operational detail.
- The LLM projections of new average wait times (e.g., “new avg ≈ 29 h.") are not present in the prompt data; this constitutes invention of data, which is a marked error.
- The inclusion of "freeing capacity for higher-value work" is unwarranted in the context of instructions to focus strictly on waiting times.
- The numbers and ordering otherwise mirror the ground truth, and only the correct activities are discussed.

Hence, the score is 8.0—solid coverage, but with material differences in recommendations, and some minor noncompliance impacting score.
