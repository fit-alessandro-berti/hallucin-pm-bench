The LLM answer is highly accurate, providing a concise single-sentence explanation that correctly identifies the absence of timestamps and duration data as the barrier to calculation, closely mirroring the ground truth's emphasis on missing temporal information and event counts. Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "lacks ... or duration data" vs. "no ... or duration information are provided") that do not alter the core meaning but deviate from exact phrasing.
