**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major deductions, ~60% accuracy)**: LLM identifies only 2 of the 3 ground truth decision points, omitting **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** entirely as a distinct decision (board votes *approve* or *reject*). For **Underwriter Alignment Gate**, phrasing is inverted ("> 2 points" escalate vs. explicit "≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else escalate") and lacks "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" context. For **Amount Threshold Decision**, misses "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" context and exact phrasing ("system auto-approves" / "send to"). Strict loss for incompleteness and imprecise details.
- **Required Documents (full points)**: Exact match to all 6 items with precise terminology from prompt (e.g., "single pay-stub or tax slip", "(CIS) template"). Minor formatting differences (✅ vs. numbered) ignored as content-perfect; no extras or omissions.
- **Overall**: Strong structure and terminology adherence, but incomplete decision points (core task) warrant significant deduction under strict criteria. No introduction of forbidden terminology.
