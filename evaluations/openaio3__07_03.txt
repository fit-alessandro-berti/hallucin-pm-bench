7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, as well as all gateway type changes—there are no false positives or missing elements in the listing. However, it loses points based on the following strict criteria:

- **Format errors:** The LLM omits bullet points («-») before each entry under every heading, which is present in the ground truth. This is a significant error because the assessment is to be strict and follow the specified output format precisely.
- **Spacing/alignment:** In "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES," the LLM lists both gateways without the aligned indentation found in the ground truth, and it omits the space after the colon for Gateway_Payment, which causes a subtle loss in precision.
- **Parentheses for tasks:** The formatting inside parentheses is correct.
- **Ordering:** The order of the tasks and gateways is correct, matching the input and ground truth.
- **No extra output/advice:** The LLM correctly provides only the requested information and nothing else.

Due to the format non-compliance (missing bullet points and inconsistent indentation), which is significant in a strict evaluation, this answer cannot be rated higher than 7.5. The substantive information is entirely correct, but the formatting strictness demands a larger penalty.
