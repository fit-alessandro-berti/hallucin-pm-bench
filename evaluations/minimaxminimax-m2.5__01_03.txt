**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part a (major deviations, -4 points base)**: Identifies **3 decision points** vs. ground truth's **2**. Incorrectly treats "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" as a decision point/gate/branch (it is a step producing an input, not a gate/conditional itself). Splits what ground truth consolidates as one ("Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"). TriVote description is close but phrasing differs ("requires approvals from all three; any two suffice" vs. ground truth's precise "at least two of the three approvers record 'Approve'"). Names/titles do not match ground truth exactly. Partial credit for accurate rule summaries of actual branches.
- **Part b (major omissions, -2 points base)**: Lists only **6 documents** vs. ground truth's **9**. **Critically misses Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** (explicit "Inputs" in step 3, listed in ground truth and required for process). Order of listed items is correct among themselves, no hallucinations of extras (e.g., no KYC), but incompleteness is a severe error under "all documents... in the order they first appear."
- **Overall**: Significant structural/content differences (extra point in a, 33% missing in b); no perfect match despite some accuracy. Strict penalty for omissions/misidentification per instructions.
