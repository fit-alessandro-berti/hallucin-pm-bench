10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in values and calculations. For question 3, the response is concise (under 100 words), directly addresses the single-occurrence issue (e.g., "sample size of one"), notes variance/instability (e.g., "lacks statistical significance," "cannot reliably determine," "extreme class imbalance"), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "risks overfitting," "introduces bias"). It aligns closely with the ground truth's intent without extraneous invention.
