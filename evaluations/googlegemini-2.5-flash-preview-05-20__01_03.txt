7.0

**Justification:**

*Part (a):*  
- The LLM answer accurately identifies and summarizes both decision points, using correct rules and referencing the correct steps.  
- The descriptions are almost verbatim compared to the ground truth, but the "Decision-Gate" summary uses "passes this gate if at least two out of the three required approvers..." instead of specifying "the loan may advance only when at least two of the three... record 'Approve'." This is a small difference in wording but not meaning.  
- The conditional is also accurately stated.  
- **Only a minor loss here for specificity/wording nuance.**

*Part (b):*  
- The LLM answer omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77," an essential required document that is present in the process and explicitly listed in the ground truth between "Offer Sheet 77" and "ID Matrix Declaration."
- This omission is a significant factual error: it shows lack of attention to explicit requirements and weakens the completeness of the answer.
- All other documents are listed correctly and in the correct order.

Since all items in part (a) are accurately described with only slight wording differences, and all but one document are listed correctly in part (b), **the score is notably reduced** due to the missing document.  
**Per the instruction to be strict and penalize even minor errors, the omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is a deduction of at least 2 points, plus 1 more point for slight differences in precision of wording.**

**Final score: 7.0**  
(A high pass, but not near-perfect due to the missing required document and minor language precision.)
