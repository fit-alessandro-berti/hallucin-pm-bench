**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Major structural errors (-4.0 base deduction)**: Missing exclusiveGateway (`gw2` equivalent in GT) after "Initial Diagnosis" (line 5 decision: resolve vs. forward). LLM incorrectly models this as conditional/default sequenceFlows directly from task `t3` (`sf6`, `sf7`), which is **invalid BPMN 2.0**—conditions/defaults from tasks bypass required gateways; decisions must use exclusiveGateways as explicitly instructed ("Mark the two decision points with exclusive gateways"). Only 2 gateways vs. GT's 3 (all decisions: classification, diagnosis, confirmation/loop).
- **Flow inaccuracies (-1.5)**: 
  - Invalid `isDefault="true"` and `<conditionExpression>` on flows from task `t3`.
  - 12 flows vs. GT's 13; omits proper post-diagnosis split (GT `f6`-`f8`).
  - Loop modeled correctly (gw2/`sf12` to `t3`), but overall path flawed (e.g., password reset skips resolve correctly, specialist → resolve ok).
- **Element mismatches (-0.3)**: 
  - Task/gw names differ (e.g., "Classify Ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification"; "Classification Decision" vs. "Password Reset?").
  - No names on `startEvent`/`endEvent` (GT has "Ticket Submitted"/"Ticket Closed").
  - Invented conditions (`classification = 'Password Reset'`, `forwardToSpecialist = true`, `persists = true`) vs. GT's simple `yes`/`no`.
- **Metadata/Format issues (-0.2)**: Extra unnecessary xmlns (`bpmndi`, `dc`, `xsi`), `id="defs"`, different `targetNamespace`/process `id`. No `<?xml>` declaration. Still ≤40 lines, single block.
- **Positives (partial credit)**: Core elements present (start/classify/gw-provide/diagnosis/resolve/forward/confirm/end/loop). No invented extras (timers, etc.). Concise IDs. Matches password path → confirm, specialist → resolve.

**Total: 10.0 - 6.0 = 4.0**. Fails "exactly as stated" due to invalid/incomplete BPMN; would not execute/parse correctly for decisions.
