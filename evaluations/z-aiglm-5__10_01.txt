2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary (mandated terms)**: Perfect match (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance used exactly; no forbidden terms). +2.0 points baseline.
- **Structure**: Table format correct (rows/columns as specified), no extra tasks/roles. Minor deductions for unrequested title (### header), key (explanation), activity numbering (1.-6.), inconsistent bolding, and role abbreviations in headers ((AM) vs. plain). -1.0.
- **RACI Content (core evaluation, utmost strictness)**: Catastrophic mismatches across nearly all 24 cells (6 rows × 4 columns). Examples:
  | Activity | Key Differences (LLM vs. GT) |
  |----------|------------------------------|
  | Receive Application | CO: I vs. C; FC/IT: - vs. I/I (3/4 cells wrong) |
  | KYC Review | CO: R/A vs. R; AM: I vs. A; FC/IT: - vs. C/I (all 4 wrong; combines R/A incorrectly) |
  | Order Vetting | FC/IT: - vs. I/I (2/4 wrong) |
  | Payment Clearance | FC: R/A vs. R; AM: I vs. A; CO/IT: - vs. C/I (all 4 wrong) |
  | Record Update | IT: R/A vs. R; AM: I vs. C; CO/FC: - vs. I/C (all 4 wrong) |
  | Notify Customer | CO/FC/IT: - vs. I/I/I (3/4 wrong) |
  - No row matches perfectly. LLM uses excessive blanks (-), combines R/A indiscriminately on performers (violates GT's separation and "one Responsible" nuance), misses widespread Consulted/Informed roles, and misassigns accountability (e.g., AM rarely A outside its tasks). Fails "RACI allocations reflect the narrative" per rubric. -6.0 (major errors, significant loss).
- **Other**: No self-awareness issues. Total reflects ~80-90% deviation in core matrix; small formatting variances compound deductions.

**Final Score: 2.0** (Vocab saves it from 1.0; RACI failure dominates).
