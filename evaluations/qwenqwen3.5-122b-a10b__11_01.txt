**Evaluation Rationale** (strict assessment):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 by Avg_Waiting_h correctly identified/ranked (#1 Request_Documents 36.5/120.0; #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0; #3 Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4). Quoted verbatim from table. (+10/10)
- **No unwarranted content**: None. No service-time, throughput, or extra activities. Waiting-time only. (+10/10)
- **Action relevance**: All 3 actions concrete, logically tied to waiting (e.g., automation for queues), promise ≥20% cut ("projecting"). Data-driven via implied process insights. Valid, no unsupported inventions beyond projection. (+9/10; GT more assertive with invented "pilots/estimates," but LLM compliant.)
- **Format/structure/memo quality**: Crisp executive memo format (header, subject, ranked list, closing). ≤150 words (~110). GT is bare list + meta-note; minor phrasing diffs ("Avg: 36.5h" vs "avg 36.5 h"; "95th" vs "p95"; trailing ".0h" preserved). (-0.8 total for small stylistic variances.)
- **Overall**: Exemplary adherence to prompt. Differences stylistic/alternative valid actions, not errors. Strict deduction only for micro-phrasing & less specific % claims vs GT.
