The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering "No" and identifying the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 with reversed order, and C005 line 11 lacking Receive_Order) as the ground truth, with precise citations matching line numbers and case-IDs. It adheres strictly to the prompt's format ("No" followed by one paragraph). Minor deductions for stylistic differences—paragraph vs. ground truth's bullets, addition of correct but extraneous positive examples (C001/C002/C004, absent in ground truth), inclusion of timestamps (extra detail), and phrasing variations ("completely false" vs. "does **not always**")—reflect small divergences under utmost strictness, but no factual errors or omissions.
