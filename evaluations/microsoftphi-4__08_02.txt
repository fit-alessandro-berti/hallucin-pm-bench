The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on both questions. It wrongly concludes "No" for Q1, missing the alternative path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4) that enables T5 to fire using the token in P2 before T3, while populating P5 independently. The explanation for Q2 ignores this path and falsely assumes T3 is always prerequisite, directly contradicting the ground truth sequence and reasoning. No partial credit for structure, as the core analysis is entirely flawed.
