1.0

The LLM answer fails catastrophically across all criteria: it is not an executive memo (no To/From/Subject, no ≈150 words, no introductory analysis); selects incorrect third activity (Verify Identity instead of Risk Review, ignoring joint SLA breach + high wait prioritization); provides zero quantification of SLA excesses; offers vague, non-data-driven recommendations ungrounded in table metrics; misuses bullets for the entire response instead of only recommendations; severely under-length and unstructured. No adherence to prompt structure or data fidelity.
