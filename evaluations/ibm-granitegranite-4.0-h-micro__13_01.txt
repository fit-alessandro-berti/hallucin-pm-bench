9.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Q1 (Weight: ~25%)**: The LLM answer ("1 time") is semantically identical to the ground truth ("1 occurrence") and directly answers the question without adding unsubstantiated details. No loss.
- **Q2 (Weight: ~25%)**: Exact match in calculation and formatting (5.56%), including rounding to two decimal places. No loss.
- **Q3 (Weight: ~25%)**: Essentially identical content ("A1002" as the sole case), with minor phrasing differences (e.g., "is" vs. implied plural handling in ground truth). Acceptable under strictness, but slight deviation in singular/plural nuance deducts 0.5 points overall.
- **Q4 (Weight: ~25%)**: Provides two clear, valid reasons matching "small sample size" and "temporal bias" from the ground truth options, with appropriate explanations derived solely from the log (e.g., 4 cases, single day). No hallucinations or inferences beyond data. However, lacks the quantitative specificity in the ground truth example for sample size (e.g., variance via Â±5.56 pp), which under utmost strictness deducts 0.5 points for not fully exemplifying the ideal depth.

Overall, the answer is highly faithful to the ground truth, with no violations of the system prompt (e.g., no assumptions beyond the 18 lines). Minor phrasing and depth variations prevent a perfect 10.0.
