The LLM answer produces a JSON output that is **identical** to the ground truth in structure, values, order, and content:
- Q1: 3 (correct)
- Q2: "Pack_Items" (correct)
- Q3: "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00" (exact match)
- Q4: 2 (correct)
- Q5: ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] (exact list, unsorted fine per prompt)

All inferences (e.g., per-case sequences via timestamps, first events, counts) are directly derivable from the log without hallucination or addition. Preceding explanatory text aligns precisely with the provided rationale, uses only log facts (timestamps/case IDs/activities), and does not alter or contradict the required JSON schema. No errors, violations of "only use facts directly from log," or deviations warrant deduction under strict evaluation.
