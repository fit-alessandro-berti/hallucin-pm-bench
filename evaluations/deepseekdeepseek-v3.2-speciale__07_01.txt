7.5

### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added: `check_vip`, `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). No extra or incorrect items, no speculation—perfect on content accuracy.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Missing IDs**: Ground truth includes exact `id` attributes (e.g., `(id = `check_vip`)`) for all tasks, which are factual XML elements. LLM omits them entirely (-2.0 points).
- **Gateway reference**: LLM uses display `name="Warranty Valid?"`; ground truth uses precise `id="gw_valid"` (-0.5).
- **Gateway phrasing**: Lacks `(v1)`/`(v2)` versioning, bolded types, and backticks (-0.5).
- **Formatting**: Bullets (`-` vs `*`), minor spacing/whitespace differences (-0.5).

Semantically near-perfect (9.5+), but textual/precise differences from ground truth deduct to 7.5. Identical output would be 10.0.
