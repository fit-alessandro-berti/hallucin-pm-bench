7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Overall Compliance Conclusion**: Both the LLM answer and ground truth correctly conclude "Non-compliant." No deduction here.
- **Rule 1**: Identical assessment (satisfied). Matches ground truth perfectly.
- **Rule 2**: Identical assessment (violated, with correct reasoning on `Risk_Assessment` after `Ship_Goods`). Matches ground truth.
- **Rule 3**: Significant error. LLM incorrectly states compliance, claiming `Three_way_match` (event 10) is "exactly two activities after" `Goods_Received` (event 6). This miscounts the distance: events 7, 8, and 9 intervene (distance = 3 > 2), making it a clear violation as per ground truth and rule ("within the next two activities"). This is a factual error in analysis, warranting a major deduction (e.g., -2.0 points).
- **Rule 4**: Substantially matches (satisfied; both note no direct follow from CFO to Intern, referencing intervening events). Minor phrasing difference, but no impact (-0.2 deduction).
- **Rule 5**: Identical assessment (satisfied). Matches ground truth.
- **Structure and Justification**: LLM uses a numbered list with compliant/non-compliant labels, citing events and rules, similar to ground truth's bolded format. It explicitly ties non-compliance to Rule 2 but misses mentioning Rule 3's violation, making the justification incomplete. Overall, clear and rule-citing, but the omission of the second violation reduces completeness (-0.3 deduction).
- **Strictness Applied**: As instructed, the Rule 3 error (a core analytical mistake affecting rule application) leads to significant point loss. However, the answer is 80% aligned (correct on 4/5 rules, correct outcome), so not a total failure. Total deductions from 10.0 yield 7.5.
