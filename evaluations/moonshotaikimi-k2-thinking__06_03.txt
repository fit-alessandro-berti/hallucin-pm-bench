The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, with exact task names and proper numbering in sequence, fully addressing the prompt without referencing Processes A or C. It is concise and accurate in substance. Minor deductions for stylistic differences from the ground truth: use of curly braces `{}` instead of descriptive "Set X – parallel block:" labeling with `‖` symbol; addition of explanatory phrases ("tasks that can execute after the [X] parallel split") not present in ground truth; lack of the concluding "No other tasks..." statement; and inconsistent spacing around task names in sets (e.g., extra spaces after commas). These are small formatting and phrasing variances but warrant a slight point reduction under strict evaluation criteria, though they do not alter factual correctness.
