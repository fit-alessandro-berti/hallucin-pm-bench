5.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **R1**: Matches status and justification (Compliant, correct sequence for high-value PO). Full points.
- **R2**: Major error—status incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated; justification ignores impact of Change_Request requiring new approval (last approval 2025-03-07), misstates timeline as "1 calendar day" (rule specifies 2), and focuses wrongly on "initial approval." Significant deduction for misinterpretation of rule interplay.
- **R3**: Matches status and justification (Violated, Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods). Full points.
- **R4**: Matches status and justification (Not Applicable, hazardous=false). Full points.
- **R5**: Status matches (Violated), but justification incomplete—mentions only Ship_Goods, omits Pay_Invoice as another pre-approval step after Change_Request (per ground truth). Partial deduction for insufficient detail.
- **R6**: Matches status and justification (Compliant, ends with Archive_Record). Full points.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by R2 violation not identified.
- **Format/Conciseness**: Adheres to ≤20 words per justification; structure close to required (list format vs. table, minor).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: One critical rule error (R2) and one partial (R5) warrant ~50% score loss from perfect (10.0 baseline), emphasizing rule misapplication over minor phrasing.
