6.5

Rationale:
- R1: Correct assessment, clear justification. ✅
- R2: Incorrectly marked as "Compliant" when it’s actually violated: Ship_Goods occurred before second Manager_Approval (final required approval following Change_Request), and not within 2 days of that approval. ❌ Significant error.
- R3: Correctly marked as "Violated" with accurate reasoning. ✅
- R4: Correctly marked as "Not Applicable." ✅
- R5: Correctly marked as "Violated" with accurate justification. ✅
- R6: Correctly marked as "Compliant." ✅
- Conclusion is correct, despite error in R2.

The error in R2 is major and reflects a misunderstanding of the "last required approval" after a Change_Request—a strict requirement of the scenario. This is critical: shipping happened before new Manager_Approval post-Change_Request, so R2 must be Violated, not Compliant. This alone accounts for at least a 2-point penalty.

Other justifications are phrased well but could be slightly more precise (e.g., specifying the reason for new approvals after Change_Request in R2).

Strictly, the answer answers most rules accurately but fails on a complex but essential point, thus 6.5.
