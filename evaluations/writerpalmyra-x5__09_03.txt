The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, precision, and content: both correctly identify the absence of data rows and timestamps in Artefact A as the sole reason metrics cannot be computed, explicitly linking to the need for start/complete times for "Approve Invoice" instances, and remain concise without guessing or external knowledge. Minor deductions (-0.2) for slight phrasing variations (e.g., listing metrics explicitly vs. "dispersion"; not naming "Artefact A" verbatim; omitting "Impossible —" opener and suggestion for "additional raw log entries," which ground truth includes as part of the precise rationale).
