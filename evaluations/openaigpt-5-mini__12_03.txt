The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and aligns precisely with the ground truth in content: it correctly identifies "No" as the answer, cites all relevant CaseIDs (C001â€“C004), details the exact activity sequences for counterexamples (C002, C004) and compliant cases (C001, C003), and justifies the invalidity of the FACT due to non-immediate occurrences. The inclusion of timestamps is a faithful extension from the log evidence without introducing errors. Minor format differences (narrative bullets vs. table) do not detract from substantive equivalence, as the prompt requires only Yes/No plus justification via CaseIDs and sequences. No factual discrepancies or omissions exist.
