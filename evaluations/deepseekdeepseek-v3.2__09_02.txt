The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt with the correct reasoning (lack of timestamps preventing duration calculation), matching the ground truth's core logic and structure as a single explanatory sentence. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences: "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; omits explicit mention of "duration information," "event counts," and "start-to-completion intervals"; uses quotes around activity name inconsistently with ground truth's curly quotes.
