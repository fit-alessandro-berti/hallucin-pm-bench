3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially identifies correct changes but deviates significantly from the ground truth and prompt instructions through inaccuracies, hallucinations, extraneous analysis, and structural non-compliance. Under utmost strictness, even minor additions of irrelevant details (e.g., name changes, flow discussions) result in point deductions, while major errors (e.g., in "Removed tasks") lead to severe penalties. Breakdown by heading:

- **Added tasks (full match, ~10% of score contribution)**: Correctly lists the three added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject) without extras. No deductions here.

- **Removed tasks (complete failure, ~10% of score contribution)**: Ground truth specifies one removal (Task_RejectLoan / "Reject Loan"). The LLM incorrectly fixates on Task_ApproveLoan as "removed" or "replaced" (despite it persisting with a rename, which should be ignored as cosmetic), asserts "none formal removal" in its summary, and injects unrelated "removed gateway type" and "removed flows" content. This is a total inversion of the facts, with confusing notes and rephrasing that violate the strict summarization rule. Zero credit.

- **Gateway-type changes (partial match with bloat, ~10% of score contribution)**: Correctly notes the core change (Gateway_Decision from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway). However, it includes ignored elements like name changes ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check"), verbose semantic discussions (e.g., "flow paths now open," "decision semantics"), and notes on flows/branches, which exceed the strict heading and introduce speculation. This dilutes accuracy and ignores "cosmetic" instruction. Partial credit only for the type shift.

- **Overall structure and compliance (~70% of score contribution)**: Fails to "strictly" use only the three headingsâ€”adds multiple overlapping "summaries," "clarifications," "notes," and a "final concise" section with interpretive blather (e.g., "atomized loan authorization," "green flow"). Ignores instruction to summarize *all* changes without extras. Verbosity and confusion make it unusable compared to the concise ground truth. Major deduction for non-adherence.

Total: The two correct elements provide a floor, but errors and excess content drag it down substantially (e.g., equivalent to ~35% accuracy). A 3.5 reflects recognition of added items and gateway core but penalizes the rest harshly per strictness guidelines.
