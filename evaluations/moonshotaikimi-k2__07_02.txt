### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: three tasks added (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), one task removed (Reject Loan), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive. No extraneous changes are mentioned, and the structure adheres to the exact headings without including ignored elements like name renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan" or gateway name changes).

However, under strict evaluation criteria, deductions apply for the following differences from the ground truth:
- **Content detail (significant loss: -1.0)**: Uses task IDs (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity`) as primary identifiers instead of names (e.g., **Verify Identity** with ID in parentheses), which reduces readability and mismatches the ground truth's user-focused emphasis on names. The gateway change omits explanatory terms like "exclusive (XOR)" and "inclusive (OR)" and version references (v1/v2), making it less precise.
- **Formatting and structure (moderate loss: -1.0)**: Lacks numbering, bolding for names, and the closing note "(No other additions...)", resulting in a plainer, less structured presentation compared to the ground truth's polished, enumerated format.

Core accuracy is high (no factual errors or omissions), but the mismatches in detail and presentation prevent a perfect score.
