The LLM answer captures all substantive changes and is grouped under the correct headings. All added and removed tasks are correctly identified, and the gateway-type change is mentioned. However, the formatting is less explicit than the ground truth answer: it lacks task names in parentheses, omits the descriptive phrasing (e.g., “changed from... to...”), and provides a technical, less human-readable gateway change statement. These minor omissions and lack of explicitness warrant a deduction, though the core information is accurate and nothing critical is missing.
