8.0

The LLM answer is quite close to the ground truth, but contains one notable error:

- For Q5, the LLM answer includes "Quality_Check" as never being the first event, but in case C-77, "Quality_Check" is the first and only event. Thus, including "Quality_Check" in Q5 is incorrect.

All other answers are correct. Due to the specificity required, and since Q5 is not fully correct, the grade is lowered significantly. A single mistake in a list warrants a strong deduction. Therefore: **8.0**.
