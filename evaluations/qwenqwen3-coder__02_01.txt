The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1-Q4. For Q5, it correctly identifies the three activities that never appear as first events ("Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") but incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which is the first event for case C-77). This is a clear factual error in the list, warranting a deduction despite the otherwise accurate response. Under strict evaluation, the extraneous item represents a significant deviation from the exact required output, reducing the score from perfect.
