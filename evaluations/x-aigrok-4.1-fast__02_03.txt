9.5

- Q1: Correct count (3), but lacks "cases" phrasing and explicit list of cases (C123, C456, C789) as in ground truth; minor but strict deduction for incomplete match.
- Q2: Exact match (Pack_Items).
- Q3: Exact match (Cancel_Order).
- Overall: Fully correct content, concise bullet format as prompted, minor formatting/label differences (1. vs A1, - vs *) not warranting severe penalty.
