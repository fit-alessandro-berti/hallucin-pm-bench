9.0

The LLM answer is factually precise across all questions, with no hallucinations, missing elements, or fabrications—the distinct cases, sequence for C002, and preceding activities for Ship_Order are all correctly identified and ordered. However, under strict evaluation criteria emphasizing minimal differences from the ground truth:

- **A1**: Core count (3) matches, but extra phrasing ("There are **3 distinct cases**") and listing of cases (C001, C002, C003) introduce unnecessary details not in the ground truth ("**3**"), warranting a minor deduction for deviation.
- **A2**: Sequence exactly matches (including underscores and arrow separators), but extra introductory text, bolding, quotes around "C002", and backticks add formatting and wording absent in the ground truth, creating superficial differences.
- **A3**: List content and alphabetical order exactly match, but extra title phrasing and minor spacing in the bullet points deviate from the ground truth's concise, HTML-rendered format.

These extras represent small but consistent formatting and verbosity differences, justifying a 1.0-point deduction from a perfect score despite perfect accuracy.
