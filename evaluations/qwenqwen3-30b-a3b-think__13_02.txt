10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, accuracy, and content. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b are exactly correct, including calculations and rounding. For question 3, the response (68 words) explicitly addresses the single occurrence (i), highlights instability/rarity leading to skewing and lack of significance (ii), and warns against generalization to unreliable models/metrics (iii), aligning fully with the required criteria without invention or excess. Minor formatting (e.g., space in "%") is insignificant.
