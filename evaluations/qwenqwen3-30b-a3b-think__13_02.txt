9.0

1. The LLM gave the correct answer for how many times "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs (**1**).
2. The LLM correctly calculated the event percentage (2.08%) and case percentage (8.33%), exactly matching the ground truth (including proper rounding).
3. The explanation for question 3 is good: it mentions low support (rarity), the concept of outliers/exceptions, and the risk of unreliable models and metrics from such a rare activity. It covers points (i) single occurrence, (ii) risk of skew/misattribution (instability/variance)—though not using those exact words—and (iii) cautions about conclusion validity (over-generalization). 

However, the answer could have more directly stated the “single observation”/“statistical instability” issue, and explicitly mention, for example, “a single case may have abnormal duration and thus skew metrics”, along with the point about confidence interval width. Also, the final sentence in (3) could be slightly more precise by explicitly warning about the misleading nature for future predictions/statistics. 

Because these are subtle omissions in the wording—but none in the numbers, and given the clear, accurate, and relevant summary for (3)—I deduct 1 point for strictness.

**Final score: 9.0**
