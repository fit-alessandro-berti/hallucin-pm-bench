The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the ground truth in content and order with no factual errors or omissions. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., added verbosity like branch labeling and summary repetition, use of curly braces instead of â€– symbol, and lack of confirmatory statement like "No other tasks"), which introduce unnecessary elaboration not present in the ground truth.
