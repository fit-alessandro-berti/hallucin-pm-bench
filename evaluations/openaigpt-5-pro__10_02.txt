3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, content, completeness, and RACI assignments, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Key differences include:

- **Column Structure (-1.5 points)**: LLM omits the "Operations Manager" column entirely, which is present in ground truth and appears essential for accountability across tasks (e.g., multiple 'A' assignments). This violates full coverage of roles implied by the informal description's delegation (e.g., clerk/analyst vs. broader operations oversight).

- **Task Coverage and Wording (-2.0 points)**: 
  - LLM splits step 1 into two tasks ("Receive transfer instruction" and "Log transfer in system"), introducing an unconsolidated extra task not in ground truth ("Receive Payment Instruction"). This adds redundancy and deviates from the source text's single step.
  - LLM adds a separate "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archival/closure" task, which ground truth folds into "Archive Record" without explicit notification breakdown.
  - No explicit task for SWIFT message sending in ground truth; LLM treats it separately ("Ensure SWIFT message is sent"), altering coverage.
  - Task phrasings differ (e.g., LLM's "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. ground truth's "Screen Against Sanctions List"; LLM's "Release payment (post-approval)" vs. "Release Payment"). Ground truth mandates precise, capitalized wording with "(mandated wording)" header, which LLM ignores.
  - Overall, LLM covers ~90% of informal steps but fragments/expands them, missing ground truth's consolidated 6-task structure (Receive, Screen, KYC, Approve, Release, Archive).

- **RACI Assignments (-2.5 points)**: Assignments mismatch across nearly all tasks, showing misinterpretation of responsibilities:
  - "Receive": LLM (R/A Analyst only) vs. ground truth (R Analyst, I Liaison, A Operations Manager, C IT Support).
  - "Screen": LLM (R/A Analyst only) vs. ground truth (R Analyst, A Liaison, I Operations Manager, C IT Support).
  - "KYC Review": LLM (R/A Liaison only) vs. ground truth (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Operations Manager, I IT Support).
  - "Approve": LLM (I Analyst, R/A Liaison) vs. ground truth (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Operations Manager, I IT Support).
  - "Release": LLM (R/A Analyst only) vs. ground truth (R Analyst, I Liaison, A Operations Manager, C IT Support). LLM's SWIFT task (R/A IT Support) has no direct equivalent.
  - "Archive": LLM (R/A IT Support only, plus separate notify) vs. ground truth (C Analyst, I Liaison, A Operations Manager, R IT Support).
  - Small errors compound: e.g., LLM's dual R/A on single roles where ground truth distributes (e.g., no 'C' or 'I' for IT in screening).

- **Vocabulary and Formatting Compliance (-1.0 point)**: LLM correctly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") where applicable (+0.5 for this), but fails to enforce strict wording in task headers (e.g., no bolding like "**KYC Review**" in ground truth). No legend provided (ground truth includes one). Markdown table is basic but lacks ground truth's header details (e.g., "Task / Activity (mandated wording)") and post-table notes on vocabulary adherence.

Total deductions leave a baseline of 10.0 reduced to 3.0. The answer partially maps the informal description and uses mandated terms but introduces inaccuracies, omissions, and extras that prevent faithful replication of ground truth. No criminal or policy violations in the answer itself.
