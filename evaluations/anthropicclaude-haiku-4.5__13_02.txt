The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. It correctly identifies the single occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check" (question 1), computes percentages precisely (1/48 ≈ 2.08% for events; 1/12 ≈ 8.33% for cases, rounded to two decimals as required; question 2). For question 3, the explanation (87 words) explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue (i), highlights statistical unreliability, lack of robustness, and risks like overfitting (ii, covering variance/instability), and warns of generalization failure with potential for misleading decisions (iii). No inventions, deviations, or errors; adheres strictly to the log data.
