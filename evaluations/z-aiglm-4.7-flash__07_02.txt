**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Added tasks (partial credit, ~7/10)**: Correctly identifies the 3 added tasks (*Task_VerifyIdentity*, *Task_RequestDocs*, *Task_FinalReject*), but fails to use **names** as primary (e.g., **Verify Identity**), listing only IDs. Ground truth prioritizes bolded names with IDs in parens; ignores numbering and phrasing match.
- **Removed tasks (major failure, ~0/10)**: Critically wrong—lists *Task_ApproveLoan* as removed, but it persists (same ID in v2, name change ignored per instructions). Only *Task_RejectLoan* ("Reject Loan") is correctly removed. Introduces false change, violating "summarise *all* changes" accurately.
- **Gateway-type changes (~8/10)**: Correctly notes *Gateway_Decision* from Exclusive to Inclusive, but misses details like **exclusive (XOR)** to **inclusive (OR)**, v1/v2 refs, and exact casing/escaping (*Gateway\_Decision*). Matches prompt example but not ground truth phrasing.
- **Overall structure/format/strictness (-2.0 penalty)**: Headings close but markdown differs (### vs * **bold**); no final note "(No other...)"; ignores "cosmetic renamings" by misclassifying *Task_ApproveLoan*. Significant content errors (false removal) outweigh minor matches, per "utmost strictness" and "small errors → significant loss." Total differences too many for >3.0.
