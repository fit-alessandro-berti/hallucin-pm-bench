The LLM answer accurately lists both sets of concurrent tasks for Process B, with correct grouping and order. The main difference from the ground truth is the omission of explicit references like "first parallel block" and "second parallel block," and a less explicit statement that "no other tasks" run in parallel. However, these are minor omissions of context/descriptions rather than substantive errors in the concurrent sets themselves. Because the focus was on strictness—even small errors count—the lack of labeling and summarization costs it half a point.
