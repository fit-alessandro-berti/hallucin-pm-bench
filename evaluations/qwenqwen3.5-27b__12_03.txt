The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering "No" and providing precise counterexamples (C002 and C004) with exact sequences and timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim per the task requirements. Justification is concise, evidence-based, and cites relevant CaseIDs/sequences without hallucination or error.

**Minor deductions (-0.5):** 
- Lacks the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case table covering *all* cases (including C001/C003 affirmatives), reducing meticulousness in a process-mining context.
- No explicit count of violations (e.g., "two out of four") or structured table, differing in presentation despite functional equivalence. Strict evaluation penalizes format/content completeness gaps.
