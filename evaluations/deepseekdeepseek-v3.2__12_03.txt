The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifies "No" and provides precise counterexamples (C002 and C004) with exact sequences from the log, directly refuting the "always" claim. This fulfills the task's requirements strictly: Yes/No answer + justification citing relevant CaseIDs and sequences. No factual errors, and counterexamples alone suffice to disprove universality per process-mining logic.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total):
- Lacks explicit case-by-case verification of *all* cases (omits confirming C001/C003 comply), reducing meticulous thoroughness vs. ground truth's comprehensive table (-0.5).
- Simpler bullet format vs. ground truth's detailed table with per-case ✅/❌ and notes (-0.3), though both are valid justifications.

Substantively equivalent; differences are presentational/completeness-oriented, not erroneous.
