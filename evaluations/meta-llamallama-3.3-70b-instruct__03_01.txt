7.0

The LLM answer captures the core process flow, elements, and loop correctly without adding unmentioned activities, gateways, or events, aligning semantically with the prompt and ground truth. However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions are warranted for multiple small-to-medium differences from the ground truth: inconsistent and incomplete <incoming>/<outgoing> declarations in nodes (e.g., t7 lists only flow5 but misses flow10; t6 misses both possible incomings), making the XML structurally flawed; use of <serviceTask> for manual agent activities (e.g., Initial Diagnosis, Forward to Specialist) instead of generic <task>; invented specific condition expressions (e.g., = 'Resolve', = 'Forward') that go beyond the prompt's description, unlike ground truth's neutral yes/no; minor name mismatches (e.g., start event "Submit Support Ticket" vs. "Ticket Submitted"; classify "Classify Ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification"; gateway labels); isExecutable="true" vs. "false"; extraneous XML attributes (xmlns:xsi, schemaLocation); and verbose formatting exceeding the â‰¤40-line limit (LLM ~65 lines vs. ground truth ~35). These accumulate to prevent a higher score, despite no major hallucinations.
