**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Identification of worst activities (partial credit, -2.5 pts)**: Correctly selects the same three (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), but wrong order (due to flawed/inconsistent composite score calc: output shows impossible 107.5/55.0/15.0 vs. actual code formula yielding ~77.5/27.5/15.0). Invents unprompted "composite score" metric absent from table, violating "based strictly on the table."
- **Explanations (major fail, -3.0 pts)**: Generic ("High Queue Time X mins and High Processing Time Y mins") ignores key table metrics like throughput drops (190/185 vs. 270+), extreme rework (22.0%/5.3%), high SLA breaches (5.5%/12.4%/3.2%). Ground truth integrates multiple precise metrics; this cherry-picks only wait/processing.
- **Recommendations (major fail, -2.5 pts)**: Identical vague template for all ("Streamline resource allocation... buffers"), not "concrete, data-driven" or tailored (e.g., no tie to 22% rework, 150min wait, 25min processing, stdev). Ground truth has specific, measurable actions (e.g., "digital requests... halve rework"). Adds hallucinated "review recent changes" (no data).
- **Format/Conciseness (major fail, -2.0 pts)**: Python code + flawed printout (cutoff note, errors) instead of direct ≤200-word markdown memo. Not executive style; bloated/irrelevant code.
- **Overall Fidelity (0 extra)**: Hallucinations, inaccuracies, ignores "no guessing"/strict table use. Ground truth is precise/perfect; differences are substantive, not minor.

Total: 10 - 10 = 0 base +2 partial for activities = **2.0**.
