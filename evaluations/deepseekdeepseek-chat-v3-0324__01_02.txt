### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points Section (Major Errors - Significant Deduction)**: The ground truth identifies exactly three true decision points (branching or approval/rejection choices): Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA). The LLM answer incorrectly includes two non-decision steps (Quick KYC Verification and Community Impact Assessment) as "decision points," which misrepresents the process flow and violates the prompt's focus on actual decisions. It also omits the MBA as an explicit decision point (board vote approve/reject). The two correct items (Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold) are mostly accurate but have minor phrasing differences (e.g., "escalate" vs. "send to"). A clear typo ("Community (C (CIA") further degrades accuracy. This core mismatch warrants a heavy penalty under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents Section (Minor Errors - Moderate Deduction)**: The list is complete and uses exact names, matching the ground truth in content. However, small additions/alterations appear: "≤ 3 months old" (ground truth: "≤ 3 months"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (ground truth: "pay-stub/tax slip"); "CIS template" (ground truth: "CIS"). The closing note differs ("All terms... defined" vs. ground truth's emphasis on exclusions like no credit bureau). These are not severe but reflect deviations from precise replication, costing points per strictness rule.

- **Overall Structure and Adherence**: The LLM uses bullet-like numbering and bolding inconsistently with the ground truth's format (e.g., "####" headers, indented details). It adheres to "exact activity names" better in documents but fails in decision points by introducing extraneous content. No standard loan terminology is added, which is positive but insufficient to offset flaws. Total score reflects ~60% alignment, penalized harshly for factual inaccuracies in the primary task element.
