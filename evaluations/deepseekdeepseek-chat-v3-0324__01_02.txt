6.5

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The LLM answer lists nearly all the correct decision points, and every required document is named with the expected terminology.
- Terms like "Underwriter Alignment Gate," "Amount Threshold Decision," and “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)” are used accurately.

**Major Errors:**
- **Incorrect Inclusion of Steps as “Decision Points”:**
  - "Quick KYC Verification (KYC)" and "Community (C (CIA)" are NOT decision points per process definition. They are process steps, not points where a branch/approval/escalation occurs. This is a significant deviation, as the prompt stresses only the actual “decision points.”
- **Incorrect Formatting/Name:**
  - “Community (C (CIA)” appears to be a typo or copy-paste error instead of the correct **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)**. Minor, but notable for strictness.
- **Missing Board Vote as a Distinct Point:**
  - The explicit decision/vote of the Micro-loan Board (step 8, “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)”) as a separate, critical decision point is not clearly highlighted; it is only referenced in relation to the Amount Threshold Decision (“escalate to Final Micro-loan Board Approval” suggests it, but does not distinguish the board’s vote as a decision point).

**Minor Errors:**
- **Documents List:**
  - Minor variations in wording, like referring to “Community Impact Statement (CIS template)” (the prompt just says “Community Impact Statement (CIS)”), or “Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)” (wordy, but present).
- **Parentheses/Formatting:** 
  - Some unnecessary parentheses, minor presentational issues.

**Overall:**  
The main deduction is for adding non-decision steps as “decision points” and for not clearly stating the Board’s approve/reject vote as a stand-alone final decision point. These are significant process-mapping errors. 

Given the instruction for *utmost strictness*, a 6.5 reflects that while the answer is close in substance for documents and mostly right for process steps, precision in identifying only the true “decision points” is off, with minor technical inaccuracies as well.
