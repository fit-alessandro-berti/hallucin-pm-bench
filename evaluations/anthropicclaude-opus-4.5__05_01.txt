**3.0**

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Wrong attachment point**: Suggests `Task_RequestDocs` (or alt. `Task_Check`), vs. ground truth's `Task_Receive`.
- **Imprecise timer specs**: "47 hours from process start" (vague, no `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H`), vs. exact `PT48H`.
- **Incorrect initial type**: Recommends *non-interrupting* first (fails proper escalation), vs. *interrupting*; alternatives dilute "one" improvement.
- **No IDs for new elements**: Omits `id="Timer_48h"` and flow ID.
- **Structure/Format**: Headers, two options, ~140 words (exceeds ≤120), not matching ground truth's concise, XML-referenced plain English.
- **Less precise SLA rationale**: Doesn't explicitly note bypassing "outstanding document requests."

Core mechanism (boundary timer + flow to `Task_Triage`) is similar (+partial credit), but details mismatch severely.
