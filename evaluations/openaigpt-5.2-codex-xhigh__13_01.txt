The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth across all questions, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. Q1-Q3 are identical in content and precision. Q4 provides two clearly stated reasons directly matching two of the ground truth options ("small sample size" and "temporal bias"), using facts observable solely from the log (18 events/4 cases, single-day ~5-hour window). Minor formatting variations (e.g., bold vs. code, % spacing, math symbols) are stylistic and do not alter meaning or accuracy. No errors or losses apply under strict evaluation.
