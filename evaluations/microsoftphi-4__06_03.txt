The LLM answer accurately identifies both parallel splits and correctly lists the pairs of concurrently executable tasks in the correct order. The wording and format are slightly different from the ground truth (for example, lack of "No other tasks..." statement and the use of "**Parallel Split #1:**" instead of "**Set 1 â€“ first parallel block:**"), but all essential information is present and unambiguous, with no errors in task listing or order. The only small deduction is for not explicitly stating that no other parallel tasks exist, reflecting a minor omission in completeness as per strict interpretation.
