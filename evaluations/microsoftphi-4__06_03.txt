7.5

### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Core Content Accuracy (high marks here, but strict deduction for extras):** The LLM correctly identifies the two parallel sets with the exact tasks (`Quality_Check` and `Update_Inventory` for the first; `Generate_Replenishment_Report` and `Notify_Procurement` for the second), matching the ground truth. No incorrect tasks or sets are included, and the order is preserved. It avoids any mention of Processes A or C, as required.
- **Formatting and Structure Differences (significant deduction):** The ground truth uses a precise, concise format: numbered as "Set 1 – first parallel block:" with tasks in backticks separated by `‖`, and a closing statement. The LLM uses "Parallel Split #1:" with bullet points, different bolding/phrasing (e.g., no backticks or `‖` symbol), and deviates by adding an introductory sentence ("For Process B... are as follows:") and a concluding explanatory sentence ("These sets represent..."). This introduces unnecessary verbosity and doesn't mirror the ground truth's minimalist style, counting as small but notable errors under strict criteria.
- **Completeness (minor deduction):** The LLM implies these are the only sets but doesn't explicitly state "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," as in the ground truth, which could be seen as a subtle omission.
- **Overall Strictness:** With utmost strictness, the extra text and formatting mismatches (even if semantic differences are minimal) warrant a deduction of 2.5 points from a perfect 10.0, as they create visible differences in the response structure and length. No major factual errors prevent a mid-high score, but perfection requires near-exact alignment.
