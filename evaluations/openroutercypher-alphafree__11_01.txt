6.0

**Explanation:**

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies #1 Request_Documents and #2 Send_Closure_Letter as the worst by waiting time, matching the table data.
- Correctly cites average and 95th-percentile waiting times for all three chosen activities, matching the provided numbers.
- The recommended actions are logical, each plausibly targeting waiting time reduction by ≥20%.
- No mention of service time, throughput, or activities not listed in the table.

**Significant Errors:**
- Critically, the third activity, **Initial_Screening** (avg 2.1h, p95 5.6h), is incorrectly chosen as #3. The correct third-worst is **Assess_Liability** (avg 7.8h, p95 16.4h). This is a major deviation, as this severely misranks the “worst” activities.
    - As a result, the memo fails the strict requirement to list only the three worst-waiting-time activities.
- The recommended actions for each activity, while logical, are not as crisp or directly data-tied as those in the ground truth.
- The memo exceeds optimal conciseness with minor executive-summary extras (e.g., sign-off, branding, superfluous context) and style that pushes against the ≤ 150 words guideline.
- Action language is more generic and lacks references to supporting data (“pilot test shows”, “estimated cut”, etc.) required in the ground truth.

**Summary:**
- -2 points: Incorrect #3 activity (major error).
- -1.5 points: Action details not as concrete/data-driven or quantified as required.
- -0.5 points: Memo style is slightly verbose; some filler beyond “strictly what was asked.”
- TOTAL: 6.0

**If a stricter penalty for the activity misranking is warranted, this could go as low as 5.0, but 6.0 is appropriate given the otherwise careful format and accuracy on figures.**
