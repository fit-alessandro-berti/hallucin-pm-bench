The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying the impossibility due to missing timestamps and durations, using a concise explanation that mirrors the required reasoning. Minor deductions for slightly more verbose phrasing (two sentences vs. one) and adding a speculative need for "at least one instance" (implying sufficiency, whereas averages require all instances), though this does not alter the core accuracy.
