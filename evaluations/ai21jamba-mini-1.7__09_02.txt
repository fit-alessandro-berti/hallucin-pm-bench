The LLM answer is largely correct and provides the key reason: the absence of timestamps or durations prevents calculation of the average cycle time. However, it slightly overruns the requirement for one concise sentence by including a second explanatory sentence about what would be needed ("To compute cycle time, I would need..."). This small deviation from conciseness and the explicitness of the ground truth warrants a deduction. Otherwise, the underlying logic is correct and matches the ground truth.
