**6.0**

The LLM answer captures the correct high-level idea (add interrupting boundary timer event with PT48H duration, new flow to Task_Triage, no new tasks), structure, and brevity (plain English, ~70 words). However, major deductions for:
- Wrong attachment point (Task_Check vs. ground truth's Task_Receive), which fails to cover delays from submission through Receive, incompletely addressing the SLA timing from "submission."
- Missing new element ID ("Timer_48h") and XML detail (<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>), despite prompt emphasizing element ID references.
- Inaccurate phrasing ("completeness check exceeds" vs. "48 hours pass without completion"), understating total process coverage.

Strict evaluation: functional approximation but key mismatches reduce score significantly.
