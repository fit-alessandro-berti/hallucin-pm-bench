10.0

The LLM answer is an exceptionally close and accurate match to the ground truth, correctly refusing to compute the value due to missing temporal data, providing a clear explanation aligned with the system's instructions, and adding relevant detail about the irrelevance of historical benchmarks without introducing errors. The only minor difference is slightly more elaboration in the LLM response (e.g., explicitly listing requirements for computation), which enhances clarity rather than detracting from fidelity. No factual inaccuracies or fabrications are present, warranting full marks under strict evaluation.
