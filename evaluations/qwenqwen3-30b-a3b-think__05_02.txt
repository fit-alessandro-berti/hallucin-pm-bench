The LLM answer fails to match the ground truth by modifying the wrong task ("Grant System Access" instead of "Collect Equipment"), changing the dueDate in the opposite direction (extending to P6D, which worsens potential SLA compliance, versus reducing to P2D), using a non-standard diff format (custom XML tags instead of unified diff with @@), and providing a rationale that misaligns with the 3-day SLA goal by focusing on timeline extension rather than contraction to meet the contractual deadline.
