4.0

The LLM answer does correctly perform a _single, attribute-only change_ and provides a plausible technical rationale. However, it fundamentally misunderstands the scenario:

**Major problems:**
- The main SLA risk, per the ground truth, is the excessive "Collect Equipment" due date (P5D), which then makes the onboarding process violate a 3-day SLA. The correct fix is to reduce this step's due date (P5D→P2D).
- The LLM's proposal instead *increases* the due date on "Grant System Access" from P1D to P6D, thereby making the process even longer and further from SLA compliance.
- The rationale demonstrates a misunderstanding: "Grant System Access" having P1D does not cause a breach; it's about the accumulated timeline through to the final handoff. The change suggested only increases the risk of non-compliance.
- The diff syntax is passable, but could be improved—a true "unified diff" should normally use the "@@" header style (as GT shows), not XML line repetition.

**Other notes:**
- Rationale explains the intent, but the underlying logic is faulty because it exacerbates the SLA breach.

**Strict penalty:** 
- Because the fix is not just suboptimal but counterproductive (making the process strictly *worse* vis-à-vis the stated SLA constraint), and displays a lack of comprehension of the actual process timing logic, the answer suffers a severe loss of points.
- The correct task to change is misidentified and the wrong attribute is changed in the wrong direction.

**Hence: 4.0.**  
(Minor positive points given for adhering to the format and not violating the activity modification constraint, as well as for an explanation, but the substance is essentially incorrect.)
