The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with correct headings, exact content for all added/removed tasks and gateway changes, and matching format per the prompt's example (e.g., no requirement for text alignment). The sole difference is minor: the ground truth includes ~5 padding spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" for visual alignment (absent in the LLM answer and prompt example), which under utmost strictness warrants a small but noticeable deduction despite being cosmetic and non-functional.
