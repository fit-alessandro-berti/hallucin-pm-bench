**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: Q1 wrongly states "No" (ground truth: "Yes"), inverting the core fact. Q2 provides an invalid explanation missing the viable path (T1→T2→T7→T4→T5) that enables T5 pre-T3 via P1/P3 without consuming P2 via T3. No credit for structure or partial reasoning, as the error is total and reasoning flawed (ignores alternative P4 path preserves P2 token). Strict evaluation demands minimal score for opposite conclusion and absence of correct sequence.
