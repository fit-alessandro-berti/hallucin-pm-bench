### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer correctly models the process **semantically and structurally** without hallucinations (no invented timers, events, activities, or gateways—matches the trap's intent perfectly). Core flow (start → classify → gw1 → provide/reset or diagnosis → gw2 → resolve/forward → resolve → confirm → gw3 → end/loop to diagnosis) exactly follows the 10 lines, with proper re-work loop to "Initial Diagnosis" and specialist path (forward → resolve). 3 exclusive gateways used correctly (despite prompt saying "two"—description implies three; ground truth agrees). Concise IDs (t1/gw1-style). XML ≤40 lines (~35). No extras.

**Significant deductions for strict line-by-line diffs from ground truth (-1.8 total):**
- **Extra wrapper text** (`"Here's..."` + ````xml``): Violates "single `<definitions> … </definitions>` block" (-0.5).
- **Namespace/prefix mismatch**: `bpmn:` prefixes + unnecessary `bpmndi` + wrong `targetNamespace`/IDs (e.g., `def1`, `p1` vs no id/`support_ticket`) (-0.4). Valid BPMN but not matching.
- **Missing XML declaration** (`<?xml ...?>`) (-0.1).
- **Element names missing/diff**:
  - Start: `start1` (no name) vs `start` ("Ticket Submitted") (-0.1).
  - t1: "Classify Ticket" vs "Auto-Classification" (small wording error) (-0.2).
  - Gateways: No names vs descriptive ("Password Reset?", etc.) (-0.3).
  - End: `end1` (no name) vs `end` ("Ticket Closed") (-0.1).
- **Condition modeling**: Flow `name=` labels (descriptive, e.g., "Password Reset") vs `<conditionExpression>` with `yes`/`no` (-0.1; both informal/non-executable, but differs).

No further losses: Equivalent logic/flows (f1-f13 match source/target), `isExecutable="false"`, no inventions. High score reflects perfect adherence to "exactly as stated" / no adds, despite stylistic diffs.
