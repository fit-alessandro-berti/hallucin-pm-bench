The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall falsity of the claim with "**No**" and accurately highlights the key counterexample in case C003 (lines 6-7), where *Validate_Payment* precedes *Receive_Order*, directly violating the "always follows" condition. It also appropriately cites multiple line numbers and case-IDs in the justification, aligning with the prompt's requirements. However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions are warranted for two errors: (1) it fails to recognize or explicitly state the second counterexample in case C005, where *Validate_Payment* (line 11) occurs without any preceding *Receive_Order* in that case, which independently disproves the "always" claim; and (2) it incorrectly asserts that the C005 instance "does follow *Receive_Order*" (phrasing it as occurring "before unrelated cancel"), misrepresenting the log and weakening the justification by erroneously grouping C005 with compliant cases. These omissions and inaccuracies create notable differences from the ground truth, which clearly delineates both counterexamples.
