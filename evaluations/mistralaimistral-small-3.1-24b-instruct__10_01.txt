6.5

**Justification:**

**Vocabulary Policy Compliance (Full Points):**
- The LLM answer uses all three mandated terms (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”) strictly as required.
- Forbidden terms are never mentioned.

**Major Issues (Significant Point Deductions):**
1. **Incompleteness of RACI Allocations (Major):**
   - The LLM answer lists only "Responsible" designations. “Accountable,” “Consulted,” and “Informed” are explicitly marked as "not applicable," which is incorrect. In the ground truth, C and I assignments are common and essential to a true RACI matrix.
   - The ground truth often has “R / A” in the same cell; this split of "Responsible" and "Accountable" is not reflected.
   - Substantial loss of points here (~2.5).

2. **Accuracy of Responsibility Assignments (Major):**
   - The answer only lists a Responsible for each task (and sometimes no one for a task), but ground truth consistently assigns R/A and also C and I. This results in important roles being left blank.
   - For example, "Receive Application" has R/A for AM in ground truth, but just Responsible here, and leaves out the C/I for others.
   - Similar omissions for all other activities. (~1.5 points off)

3. **Matrix Format:**
   - The format is clean, but blank cells are misleading—a full RACI matrix must indicate all roles per activity. (~0.5 off)

**Minor Issues:**
- The "Key" at the bottom suggests A, C, I are not used “in this context,” which is a misreading of the prompt and introduces misleading justification. (0.5 off)

**What’s Good:**
- No extra steps/roles were added.
- Strict adherence to the naming policy.

**Total:**
6.5/10 — The answer strictly follows the required terminology rules and matrix format, but misses significant portions of required RACI allocation information, which is a central failure for this task. All small but critical misses are penalized as per strict guidelines.
