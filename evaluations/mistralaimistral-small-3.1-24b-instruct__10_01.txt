The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without any forbidden terms, and it accurately identifies the single Responsible role per activity based on the process narrative. The table structure is appropriate with activities as rows and roles as columns, and no extra tasks or roles are added. However, it fails significantly in providing a complete RACI matrix: it only assigns "Responsible" (spelled out, not abbreviated) and leaves all other cells blank, omitting all Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments that are present in the ground truth. It incorrectly states in the Key that A, C, and I are "not applicable in this context," which contradicts the ground truth's detailed allocations (e.g., Account Manager as A or R/A in multiple activities, various C and I roles filled). Formatting differences (full words vs. abbreviations like "R/A"; empty vs. fully populated cells; unnecessary Key explanation) further deviate, resulting in an incomplete and inaccurate representation of a full RACI matrix. Under strict evaluation, these omissions and errors—core to the task—warrant a low score despite terminology accuracy.
