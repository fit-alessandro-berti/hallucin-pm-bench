The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content for all questions. A1 is correct (3 distinct cases). A2 provides the exact sequence in the specified order with "â†’" separators. A3 lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line, with minor formatting variation (asterisk bullets vs. dash bullets) that does not alter the required output structure or accuracy. No hallucinations, omissions, or errors detected.
