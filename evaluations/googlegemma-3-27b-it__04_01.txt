### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Overall Correctness (Major Partial Credit, but Significant Deductions)**: The LLM correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant," aligning with the ground truth. However, this is undermined by fundamental errors in rule analysis, leading to incorrect justifications. Under strict evaluation, the core value lies in the justifications, where accuracy is paramount—small errors (e.g., misidentifying rule violations) warrant major point loss.
  
- **Rule 1 Analysis (Severe Error: -2.5 points)**: LLM claims "violated" but then contradicts itself by stating it's "acceptable." Ground truth confirms it's satisfied (correct order and timing). This inconsistency shows flawed reasoning, treating a compliant rule as problematic.

- **Rule 2 Analysis (Complete Omission: -2.0 points)**: LLM entirely ignores Rule 2, missing the key violation (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods due to Expedite_Flag). Ground truth highlights this as a primary violation. Omitting a rule entirely, especially one that's violated, is a critical gap.

- **Rule 3 Analysis (Correct: +2.0 points)**: Accurately identifies the violation (distance=3 >2, with events 7-9 intervening). Matches ground truth precisely.

- **Rule 4 Analysis (Incorrect: -1.5 points)**: LLM wrongly claims violation (Intern directly follows CFO), ignoring intervening activities (4-6: System, System, Warehouse_Clerk). Ground truth correctly states it's satisfied. This is a factual misreading of the trace.

- **Rule 5 Analysis (Omission: -0.5 points)**: Not addressed, though it's satisfied per ground truth. Partial deduction for incompleteness, as a full audit should cover all rules.

- **Format and Structure (-0.5 points)**: Follows "Non-compliant" + numbered list, but list is incomplete (only 3 items vs. ground truth's 5) and includes contradictory phrasing. Ground truth is more comprehensive and structured.

- **Strictness Adjustment**: With utmost strictness, the LLM's analysis has 3 major flaws (misjudgment, omission, factual error) out of 5 rules, inverting compliant/non-compliant statuses for key rules (1 and 4) and missing one violation. This reflects poor rule-tracing accuracy, justifying a low-mid score despite the correct high-level conclusion. No small errors here—all are substantive.
