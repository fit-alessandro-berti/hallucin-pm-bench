4.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies NON-COMPLIANT status and correctly identifies the violation for Rule 3 (distance from `Goods_Received` to `Three_way_match`). However, it contains multiple significant errors that must be penalized under strict criteria:

1. **Rule 1:** The LLM answer initially claims a violation, but then admits both approvals are present and in order before `Issue_PO` (which is correct); this contradictory wording can cause confusion, but the conclusion for Rule 1 is ultimately correct (should lose points due to clarity/confusion in justification).

2. **Rule 2:** The LLM answer completely omits assessment for Rule 2. The ground truth specifies this rule is violated (`Risk_Assessment` occurs after `Ship_Goods`, which is forbidden when `Expedite_Flag` is present), a critical error in omission.

3. **Rule 3:** The answer correctly explains and identifies the violation, consistent with the ground truth.

4. **Rule 4:** The LLM answer (incorrectly) claims a violation here, saying that "Move_to_Quality" by Intern directly follows a CFO activity, while in fact there is an intervening System activity (`Expedite_Flag`). The ground truth makes it clear there's NO such violation. This is a serious factual mistake.

5. **Rule 5:** Not mentioned at all (minor, as the rule appears satisfied).

Summary: The correct non-compliance conclusion is reached, and the answer identifies the correct Rule 3 violation, but it fully omits Rule 2 assessment (criticalâ€”in the ground truth, this rule is violated), misjudges Rule 4 status, and contains confusion in Rule 1 justification. Each of these are major or moderate errors. Thus, the answer deserves a strict score of 4.0.
