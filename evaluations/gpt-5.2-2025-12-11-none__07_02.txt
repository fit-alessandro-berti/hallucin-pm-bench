**8.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies all changes with perfect accuracy in content: the three added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), the one removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway change (exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision). No extras, misses, or violations of ignore rules (e.g., no name changes listed). However, under utmost strictness:

- **Format/structure differences** (-0.5): Uses ### headings and unnumbered bullets vs. GT's ## header, * **bold headings*, numbered lists (1., 2., etc.), and final note "(No other...)".
- **Item presentation** (-0.5): Lists **id** (“name”) vs. GT's **name** (`id`); reversed priority; quotes vs. backticks; no numbering.
- **Gateway phrasing** (-0.5): "**exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)" vs. "**exclusive** (XOR) in *v1* to **inclusive** (OR) in *v2*"; full XML tags vs. short terms + abbreviations + italics.

These are small but multiple stylistic/presentation mismatches, warranting deduction per strict criteria, though core analysis is flawless.
