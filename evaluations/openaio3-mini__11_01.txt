7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities and numbers)**: Perfect match. The LLM accurately identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) and quotes the exact average and 95th-percentile waiting times from the table. No errors here (+3.0 points).
- **No unwarranted content**: Fully compliant. No mentions of service times, throughput, or other activities. The response stays focused and under 150 words (~120 words) (+2.0 points).
- **Action relevance**: Actions are concrete, logically tied to reducing waiting times, and each explicitly promises â‰¥20% reduction without fabricating unsupported data (e.g., no invented "pilot tests" or percentages beyond the threshold). However, they differ significantly from the ground truth's specific recommendations (e.g., automated reminders/escalation vs. portals; e-signature replacement vs. automated generation; rules-engine bypass vs. decision-support tools), which reduces closeness. Ground truth emphasizes more "data-driven" elements like pilots and estimates, making LLM's actions valid but less aligned (-1.5 points deduction from full).

Overall, strong on facts and constraints but penalized for substantive differences in action details and slightly more narrative format vs. ground truth's concise, bullet-style structure. Strict scoring reflects these as notable deviations.
