The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, numbers them in order, uses accurate task names matching the process description, and provides no extraneous information about Processes A or C. It adheres closely to the prompt's requirements.

Minor deductions for:
- Added introductory sentence (not in ground truth).
- Different phrasing and formatting ("**task** and **task** (triggered by Parallel Split #1)" vs. "**Set 1 – first parallel block:** `task` ‖ `task`"), including "and" instead of "‖" and "#1/#2" vs. descriptive "first/second".
- Absence of the explicit closing statement ("No other tasks...").

These are presentational differences but exact content match on core elements justifies a high score under strict evaluation.
