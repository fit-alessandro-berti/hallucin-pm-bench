3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
I evaluated the LLM answer against the ground truth with utmost strictness, penalizing omissions, inaccuracies, and deviations heavily—even minor phrasing differences contribute to point loss. The score reflects partial correctness in part (a) but severe deficiencies in part (b), resulting in a low overall rating.

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- **Strengths**: Both decision points are identified correctly (risk-based skip and TriVote gate). The risk-skip rule is summarized accurately in one sentence, closely matching the ground truth's condition (Low/Medium risk AND ≤ €250,000 to bypass step 5).
- **Weaknesses**: 
  - TriVote summary introduces an interpretive addition ("requiring all three votes to render a decision") not present in the ground truth, which strictly focuses on "at least two... record 'Approve.'" This alters the emphasis slightly, violating the "one sentence each" precision and the process's wording ("requires approvals from all three" but rule is "any two suffice").
  - Phrasing is wordier and less concise than the ground truth's tight structure (e.g., no bolding of key terms like **Low or Medium** or **€250 000**).
- **Impact**: Mostly aligned but with small interpretive and stylistic errors, warranting ~70% credit (not full due to strictness on exact rule description).

#### Part (b): Documents
- **Strengths**: Includes core documents like Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, and Loan Dossier 2025. No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML items).
- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Major omissions**: Completely misses the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicit inputs/documents first appearing in step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check). This is a critical gap, as they are required for the risk rating and must be listed in first-appearance order.
  - **Incorrect order**: Deck Memo (step 5) is listed second, prematurely before the scorecards (step 3). The sequence violates the "order they first appear" rule.
  - **Incompleteness in details**: Fails to distinguish "Offer Sheet 77" (unsigned, step 7) from "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (step 8), merging them into one entry. Adds unnecessary qualifiers like "(if applicable)" for Deck Memo, implying optionality not in the ground truth's exhaustive list.
  - **Overall brevity**: Lists only 5 items vs. ground truth's 9, making it substantially incomplete.
- **Impact**: Fundamental errors in completeness, order, and granularity result in ~20% credit—significant deductions for missing core elements and structural flaws.

#### Overall Score Calculation
- Part (a) ~7/10 (good coverage, minor rule/phrasing issues).
- Part (b) ~2/10 (severe omissions and errors dominate).
- Weighted average (equal parts): 4.5, rounded down to 3.5 for strictness on "small errors" (e.g., added interpretation, qualifiers) compounding the major flaws. The answer fails to fully capture the process's specificity, especially documents, which the ground truth emphasizes as exhaustive.
