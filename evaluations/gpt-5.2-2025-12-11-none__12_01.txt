**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in verdict ("not accurate" vs. "inaccurate"), structure (per-case bullet justification), and evidence (correctly identifies reversed ordering in cases 1001/1003 with activity sequences; absence in 1002 disproving "always"). It strictly cites case IDs and activities as prompted, with no errors, guesses, or omissions. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., no line numbers, arrow notation for sequences, no final summary sentence) do not alter content or violate instructions, warranting no deduction under strict evaluation.
