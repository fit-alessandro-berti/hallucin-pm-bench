### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added Tasks (Partial Credit, ~7/10)**: Correctly identifies all three added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject) with accurate names and basic context from flows. However, minor deductions for non-standard phrasing (e.g., "Added after Verify Identity flow" instead of just naming the task) and not strictly matching the ground truth's concise format (name + ID).

- **Removed Tasks (Zero Credit, 0/10)**: Critical error—completely misses the removal of Task_RejectLoan, which is explicitly present in v1 but absent in v2. Incorrectly claims "NO tasks removed," directly contradicting the ground truth and prompt to summarize *all* changes.

- **Gateway-Type Changes (Partial Credit, ~5/10)**: Correctly notes the change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway for Gateway_Decision. However, redundantly lists it twice as separate items, adds unnecessary XML tags, and omits the explanatory types (XOR → OR) as in the ground truth example. This violates strict adherence to concise summarization.

- **Overall Structure and Adherence (~3/10)**: Uses the exact headings but adds extraneous concluding sentence referencing "task names" (which the prompt instructs to ignore) and "core process structure," introducing irrelevant analysis. Fails to be exhaustive and precise, with the removed tasks omission being a severe deviation warranting major point loss. Total reflects strict criteria: one major error halves the score, compounded by small formatting/precision issues.
