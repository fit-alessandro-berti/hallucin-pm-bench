The LLM answer is clear, precise, and correctly states that the required metrics cannot be computed because all relevant timestamp data have been redacted from Artefact A. It specifically mentions the absence of both start_time and complete_time for the “Approve Invoice” activity as the reason.

However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer is slightly less comprehensive:  
- It does not explicitly mention that all event rows have also been removed (it says “all timestamp data…have been redacted,” but does not state that every row is absent).
- The ground truth adds, “Additional raw log entries are required,” which is a helpful closing touch, letting the client know what would be needed. The LLM answer misses this suggestion.

Thus, while the reasoning and the justification are accurate and fully responsive, the answer is slightly less thorough in scope than the ground truth.

Due to this minor lack of completeness and detail, I deduct points accordingly.
