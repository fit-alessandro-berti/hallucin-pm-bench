7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the count as 1 (exact match). For Q2, it stays under 120 words and addresses core issues like small sample size (sampling bias) and naming variations (near-synonyms), aligning partially with the ground truth's emphasis on tiny excerpt and string-matching distortions. However, it introduces speculative elements (e.g., process shifts over time, case-mix distortion, logging practices) not directly evidenced in the data, deviating from the "no speculation" rule and broadening beyond the ground truth's precise focus on sampling error, confidence intervals, and rare-event volatility. This adds unnecessary breadth and risks misleading, warranting a deduction for fidelity.
