### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s, all accurate from data) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). It uses bullet points exclusively for recommendations, as required, and sticks to provided metrics without inventing absent activities or data. The memo is concise (~140 words) and grounds descriptions in the table.

However, under strict evaluation, several differences from the ground truth significantly detract:
- **Structure and formatting**: Lacks precise header elements (e.g., "To:", "From:", specific subject like "Throughput Bottlenecks in Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)"); uses informal "Dear COO" vs. professional addressing. No bolding for emphasis or "**Recommended actions**" header. No total cases aggregation (4,805, derivable from data sum).
- **Introduction and phrasing**: Generic opener ("Our review...") omits data-grounded context like "Analysis of 4,805 completed cases highlights three activities that materially breach service targets while accumulating the largest queues." Adds unsubstantiated claim ("These issues impact efficiency and customer experience"), violating "ground every sentence in the data."
- **Quantification details**: Mentions waiting times but integrates them less clearly (e.g., no "average throughput **900 s** vs. 600 s SLA (+300 s)" format); ties waiting to exceedance imprecisely.
- **Recommendations**: Data-driven (references cases/waiting times) but vague and less concrete (e.g., "reduce waiting time by prioritizing cases... potentially through resource allocation" vs. ground truth's specific, actionable ideas like "Introduce rule-based pre-checks so low-risk files bypass"). Lacks projection of impact (e.g., "reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35%"), reducing executive value.
- **Overall polish**: Misses closing summary for strategic insight; feels less professional and data-centric.

These omissions and deviations (e.g., no total cases, weaker recommendations, format mismatches) warrant a mid-range score, penalizing for not fully mirroring the ground truth's rigor despite core accuracy.
