### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall, capturing the core decision points and document list accurately with no major factual errors or introduction of prohibited terminology. However, under strict evaluation criteria, it incurs point deductions for several small but cumulative differences from the ground truth:

- **Decision Points (minor deductions: ~1.0 total)**:
  - Adds interpretive details not in ground truth, e.g., "continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (ground truth implies but doesn't specify the next step explicitly), "proceed directly to Disburse Funds" (ground truth says "system auto-approves" without this phrasing), and "if approved, proceed to Disburse Funds" (ground truth omits post-approval flow).
  - Slight rephrasing: "differ by > 2 points" vs. ground truth's "≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else ⇒" (equivalent but not identical structure); "requested amount" and "route to" vs. "amount" and "send to".
  - Omits explicit context like "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (LLM implies these but doesn't state them verbatim).
  - Adds "only for amounts ≥ €15 000" qualifier to the MBA point, which is accurate but expands beyond ground truth's concise description.

- **Required Documents (minor deductions: ~1.0 total)**:
  - Phrasing variances: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months" (adds "old"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (adds "single" and "or" instead of "/"); " (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (adds "template").
  - Uses bullets instead of numbered list (structural difference).
  - Omits the ground truth's closing note: "*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*" (which reinforces the process's uniqueness).

These deviations, while not altering meaning, represent small errors in fidelity to the ground truth's exact wording, structure, and conciseness, warranting a high but not perfect score. The response adheres to the prompt's rules on terminology and focus.
