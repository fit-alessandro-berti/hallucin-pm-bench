**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses **Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring** exactly for the first four activities. No disallowed synonyms leak. However, new activities use unauthorized/renamed terms (e.g., "Approval (if score >70)", "Schedule Payment", "Release Funds & Notify" vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds").
- **Structure & Format (major deductions, -3.0)**: Markdown table present, but header mismatch ("Activity / Role" vs. "Activity"); no bolding on activities/cells; blanks instead of dashes (–); conditional notation "C (if >70)" invalid for RACI; 7 activities vs. ground truth's 6 (adds "Schedule Payment", merges "Release Funds & Notify").
- **Activities (major deductions, -2.5)**: Renames, merges, adds activities (violates "do not rename, merge, or add"); misses exact ground truth breakdown (e.g., no separate "Compliance Officer Approval"; invents "Schedule Payment").
- **RACI Assignments (catastrophic mismatch, -3.5)**: Almost entirely wrong across all cells. Examples:
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Missing Front A, Comp Analyst C, Treas I; only partial R. |
  | KYC Review | Missing Comp Analyst A, Comp Officer C, Treas I. |
  | AML Screening | Same as KYC. |
  | Risk Scoring | Wrong: Comp Officer C (conditional) vs. A; missing Front C, Treas I; Comp R partial. |
  | Others | All invented/wrong (e.g., no "Compliance Officer Approval" with correct R,A/I/C; sparse I/C usage). |
- **Coverage**: Misses roles/activities (e.g., no Front C in Risk Scoring; incomplete I/C chains); does not fully cover "every activity and role described."
- **Overall**: ~20% alignment (vocab + basic table); strict policy demands zero tolerance for differences → low score.
