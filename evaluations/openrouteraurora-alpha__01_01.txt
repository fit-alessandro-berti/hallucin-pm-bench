**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision points (major discrepancies, ~50% of prompt weight)**: LLM identifies 6 points vs. ground truth's 3, introducing non-decisions (#5 Process_Refund_Payment: execution, not a decision per constraints; #6 Issue_Confirmation_Letter: automatic post-payment). Over-splits approvals (#2, #4 vs. consolidated #3 in ground truth). Misses explicit "branching logic/outcomes" like rejects (*Not eligible* → rejected; *Rejected* → ends). Implicit branch (#3) ok but padded with extras. Significant invention/misrepresentation → heavy deduction (-4.0 pts).
- **Documents (minor match, ~50% weight)**: Lists all 7 correctly, with accurate usage/context (e.g., AuditTrail conditional). Matches ground truth closely, including note on high-value. No extras introduced → full credit here (+2.0 pts relative).
- **Overall**: Comprehensive structure but core inaccuracies in decision identification violate "summarise every decision point" precisely; no new artefacts but misrepresented process logic. Strict penalty for extras/small phrasing diffs (e.g., no reject paths). Baseline 10 → net -5.8.
