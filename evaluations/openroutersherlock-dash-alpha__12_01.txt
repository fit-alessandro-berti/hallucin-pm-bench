The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, verdict, and evidence: both correctly deem the fact inaccurate, cite all three cases with precise order reversals or absences, and conclude the sequence does not occur. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., timestamps vs. line numbers, bolding) do not affect factual accuracy or completeness.
