6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment) based on joint criteria of SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies the exceedances (+300s for Legal Approval and Risk Review; +60s for Credit Assessment) using provided data (Avg_Throughput_Time vs. Target_SLA). Waiting times are also correctly cited (600s, 480s, 200s). The memo is concise (~140 words, close to ≈150) and grounds content in the table without inventing absent activities or unsupported metrics.

However, under utmost strictness, several differences from the ground truth warrant significant deductions:
- **Structure and Format (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: The prompt specifies "bullet points *only* for the recommendations." The LLM embeds recommendations within a numbered list for activities, rather than using a separate bulleted section as in the ground truth. Headers differ (e.g., LLM's "To: COO, Orion Credit" and subject vs. ground truth's "To: Chief Operating Officer," "From: Process Performance Office," and more specific subject). No "From" line in LLM.
- **Content and Phrasing Differences (moderate deduction: -1.0 points)**: Order of activities varies (LLM: Risk Review first, then Legal Approval; ground truth: Legal first). Introductory sentence differs (LLM focuses on "underperform based on SLA breaches and high waiting times" without mentioning total cases; ground truth includes an invented "4 805 completed cases" and "materially breach service targets while accumulating the largest queues"). LLM adds subjective qualifiers like "highest waiting time" and "second-highest," not present in ground truth.
- **Recommendations (major deduction: -1.0 points)**: While each provides one concrete, data-driven action per activity, they are entirely different:
  - Risk Review: LLM suggests a "tiered review system to fast-track low-risk cases"; ground truth proposes adding an analyst and automating scores.
  - Legal Approval: LLM recommends "automate routine document checks"; ground truth suggests "rule-based pre-checks to bypass full approval."
  - Credit Assessment: LLM proposes "AI-assisted scoring tools"; ground truth recommends a "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k" (note: ground truth invents loan amount, but difference still counts).
- **Closing and Overall Fidelity (minor deduction: -0.5 points)**: LLM's closing ("These actions target bottlenecks while leveraging existing data") is generic and absent in structure from ground truth, which includes a projection sentence on cycle time reduction (invented, but a stylistic difference). No equivalent analysis framing or projections in LLM.

The core analytical accuracy (activities, metrics) aligns well, preventing a lower score, but format violations, differing recommendations, and structural mismatches reflect imperfect adherence to the prompt's intent as mirrored in the ground truth.
