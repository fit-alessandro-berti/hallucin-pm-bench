**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth)
- **Vocabulary (mandated terms)**: Perfect match (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance used exactly; no forbidden terms). +2.0 points.
- **Structure**: Activities match exactly in name/order (6 rows). Columns match roles but use **abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) instead of full names** (Account Manager etc.) – major format violation. No bolding on key terms/entries as in ground truth. Table markdown differs (e.g., alignment/spacing). -3.0 points.
- **RACI Allocations**: 
  - Responsible (R) positions correct (one per row, matching handlers/narrative: AM for Receive/Order Vetting/Notify; CO for KYC; FC for Payment; IT for Record). Partial credit.
  - **Critically incomplete**: No Accountable (A), Consulted (C), or Informed (I) entries; all non-R cells blank vs. ground truth's full specifications (e.g., Receive Application lacks CO=C, FC=I, IT=I; KYC Review lacks AM=A, FC=C, IT=I; etc.). Misses R/A combinations (e.g., **R / A** for AM in 3 rows). Fails "AM is Accountable where appropriate" and full RACI reflection. -5.0 points.
- **Unwarranted Content**: None (no extras). +0.5 points.
- **Overall**: ~40% match (terms/R positions only); massive cell-level differences (18/24 cells wrong/blank). Strict rubric demands near-identical output; small errors (headers, no bolding) compound to significant deductions. Base 10 → net 2.0.
