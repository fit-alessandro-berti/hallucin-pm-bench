**Evaluation:**

### Decision Points

**Strengths:**
- The LLM correctly identifies the three core decision points: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- Document requirements are fully and correctly listed.

**Major Errors Resulting in Point Deductions:**
- The LLM introduces **additional pseudo-decision points** that are not present in the defined process:
    - Treats "Quick KYC Verification (KYC)" and "Community Impact Assessment (CIA)" and "Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" as decision points. While these are process steps, they are **not explicit decision points** per the ground truth.
    - The ground truth answer **only lists three decision points**; adding non-decision activities to this list counts as a significant procedural inaccuracy.
- The LLM sometimes adds extra pseudo-gates (e.g., “proceed only if assessment is deemed sufficient”), when the official process only requires these steps to be performed, not “passed” by criteria outside those given.
- The LLM does **not state** that the “Underwriter Alignment Gate” is *after* the Dual Underwriter Split, potentially leading to ambiguity about sequence.

**Minor Issues:**
- Some slight terminology drift and extraneous explanations (e.g., "proceed only if both are verified"), when the terminal decision logic should be reserved for the explicit decision gates.

### Document Listing

**Strengths:**
- All required documents are correctly and completely listed, matching ground truth.
- Correct use of document names and terminology.

**Overall Strictness:**
- Because the prompt required *only* decision points (strict as per ground truth), introducing additional non-decision activities is a significant accuracy problem.
- The document list is perfect.
- Improvement would require identifying ONLY the three core decision points and using the exact format and sequence of the ground truth.

**Summary:**  
Correct required document list (**no errors**), but significant process definition error in expanding/splitting decision points not supported by the ground truth, with overly loose interpretations resulting in a large penalty.  
**Score:** 6.5/10
