### Explanation of Evaluation
- **Decision Points (Major Deviation, Severe Penalty)**: The ground truth strictly identifies only 3 true decision points (branching/escalation/approval gates: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval). The LLM incorrectly expands this to 6 items, fabricating "decision" criteria for non-decision steps like Quick KYC Verification, Community Impact Assessment, and Neighbourhood Feedback Check (e.g., adding unprompted "proceed only if..." conditions and implying pass/fail thresholds not present). It also embeds prior steps (e.g., underwriter assignments) into the Alignment Gate description, violating the prompt's call for exact activity names and summaries without introducing extraneous flow. Positions in the process (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split") are omitted or altered. This fundamentally misrepresents the process, warranting a ~50% deduction for inaccuracy and over-elaboration.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Issues, Smaller Penalty)**: The list is complete and matches all 6 items, using exact terminology. However, small errors include: rephrasing "≤ 3 months" to "≤ 3 months old" (unnecessary addition); expanding "pay-stub/tax slip" to "single pay-stub or tax slip" (introduces "single" not in ground truth); adding "template" to Community Impact Statement (CIS) without basis; bolding/formatting inconsistencies; and omitting the ground truth's clarifying note on excluded standard documents. These are minor but, per strictness, deduct ~10-15% for wording fidelity.

Overall, the LLM answer is helpful in structure but fails the core task of precise summarization, with significant content errors outweighing document accuracy.
