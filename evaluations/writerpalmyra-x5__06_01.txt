9.5

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, pairs, order, and basic format. Correct pairs only, alphabetical ordering perfect (within pairs and list). However, strict evaluation notes minor whitespace/formatting differences:
- No code block (ground truth presented in ```).
- Second line lacks alignment spaces ("Procure_Materials     —" vs. "Procure_Materials  —").
- Potential extra/trailing spaces after "Quality_Check" in first line (rendering shows "  ").

These small formatting discrepancies deduct 0.5 despite semantic perfection.
