5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Part 1 (Accuracy of Count)**: The LLM correctly identifies 1 occurrence of “Manual Fraud Check”, matching the ground truth exactly. No deduction here (10/10).
- **Part 2 (Explanation Quality)**: The response is under 120 words and notes the limited timeframe and lack of representativeness, with a nod to variability via examples of automatic checks. However, it lacks critical depth: no mention of sample size specifics (14 events, 3 cases, <2 hours), frequency swing risks (0% to 7%), wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events, or pitfalls in string matching vs. near-synonyms like “Automatic Fraud Check”. This makes it superficial and incomplete compared to the ground truth's precise, statistical analysis. Significant loss for omissions under strict criteria (-5/10 for part 2).
- **Overall**: Strong on facts, weak on analytical rigor; averaged to 5.0 reflecting substantial content gaps.
