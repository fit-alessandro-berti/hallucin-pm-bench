**1.0**

### Evaluation Summary (strict criteria applied):
- **Structural mismatch (fatal, -9.0)**: LLM uses invalid/invented schema ("flowDiagram", flat "events"/"legs") vs. ground truth's standard BPMN JSON ("process_id", "elements" array with BPMN types, "flows" array). JSON is malformed (e.g., `"flowDiagram": "system',` syntax error).
- **Missing core elements (-3.0 cumulative)**: No "Root Cause Analysis" task; no exclusiveGateway for Simple/Complex; no proper parallelGateway fork/join for logging/response; no eventBasedGateway + intermediateCatchEvents (message/timer) for 24h wait/reply; no terminateEndEvent.
- **Incorrect flows/logic (-3.0 cumulative)**: Direct flow from Classification to Resolution (ignores Complex path); parallel mishandled (no join, invented "parallelBeam"); timer logic wrong ("Reply No" splits to Reminder **and** Close in parallel vs. sequential Reminder→Close); cancel oversimplified as single leg vs. multi-point catchEvent.
- **Hallucinations/extras (-2.0 cumulative)**: Invented "Check for Customer Cancel", "Terminate Process if Canceled", "Reply Received"/"Reply No"; no adherence to "only what is described".
- **Fidelity to description/ground truth (0/10)**: ~20% element/flow overlap at best (e.g., basic sequence start→classify→resolve→send); violates "well-formed JSON" and "faithfully translate". No partial credit for intent due to strictness rule.
