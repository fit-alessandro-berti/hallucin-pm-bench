**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it wrongly claims "No" (T5 cannot fire before T3), provides no valid firing sequence, and gives flawed reasoning (ignores T2b shortcut for pd and feedback via T6). This directly contradicts the ground truth's "Yes" with explicit shortest sequence ⟨T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3⟩ and detailed proof. No partial credit under strict evaluation, as the core yes/no and requirements are entirely missed.
