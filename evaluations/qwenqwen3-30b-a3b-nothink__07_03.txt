The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), matching the ground truth content verbatim. However, it omits the bullet points ("- ") used in the ground truth for all list items, and lacks the alignment spaces after the colon in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" vs. "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel"). These are small formatting discrepancies, but under utmost strictness, they warrant a minor deduction from a perfect score.
