**Justification for score:**
- The model listed all differences correctly, with no factual errors or omissions.
- However, it did not follow the formatting of using dashes (bullets) at the start of each line as required by the ground truth, and did not align the colons and add the spaces after the colons in the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section.
- Answer headings were present and correct, and only verifiable differences were provided, but the verbatim format requirement was not met in terms of bullet and space formatting—this constitutes a significant deviation per the strict instructions.
- No extraneous commentary or elements, which is good.
- Loss of 2.5 points (from perfect 10) for format errors, since the instructions require utmost strictness.
