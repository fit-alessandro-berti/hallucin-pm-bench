### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer produces a semantically equivalent BPMN 2.0 XML diagram to the ground truth, correctly modeling all explicitly mentioned flow elements from the prompt (start event, validation loop with request/re-validate, check eligibility task, warranty decision gateway, parallel shipment/pickup activities with join, update/close tasks, and exactly two end events) without hallucinations, extras, or omissions beyond the prompt. The overall process flow matches precisely, including the loop for incomplete claims and parallel execution in step 4.

However, under utmost strictness, deducting for small differences from the ground truth (even if the ground truth itself slightly deviates from prompt verbatim task naming/tenses and omits the explicit "checks warranty eligibility" task, treating the warranty gateway as implicit for checking):
- **IDs and structure (minor deduction: -0.3)**: IDs prefixed correctly with "wrc_" but longer/more descriptive (e.g., "wrc_ValidateClaimTask" vs. "wrc_validate"); includes valid but extra <incoming>/<outgoing> references in elements (ground truth omits them, relying solely on sequenceFlow refs); more comprehensive namespaces and process name (ground truth is more minimal).
- **Names (moderate deduction: -0.4)**: Task names close to verbatim but with casing/tense variances (e.g., LLM "create shipment order" vs. ground truth/prompt capitalization "Create"; LLM "validates the claim" vs. ground truth "Validate the claim"). Start event name "online warranty claim" differs from ground truth "Online warranty claim submitted" (prompt-implied but not exact). End event names ("Claim rejected"/"Claim completed" vs. "Rejected"/"Successful end") and one gateway name ("Warranty status" vs. "Within warranty?") vary. Sequence flow names added in LLM (e.g., "within warranty") but absent or different in ground truth.
- **Completeness and extras relative to ground truth (minor deduction: -0.1)**: LLM correctly includes the prompt-required "checks warranty eligibility" task before the warranty gateway (omitted in ground truth, where complete_gw flows directly to warranty_gw); this makes LLM more faithful to the prompt semantically but introduces ~3 extra elements (task + 2 flows) compared to ground truth's minimalism.

No major errors (e.g., no invented escalations/error paths, correct gateway types, exactly two ends). Full credit for semantic accuracy per rubric; deductions only for textual/structural variances from ground truth despite overall equivalence.
