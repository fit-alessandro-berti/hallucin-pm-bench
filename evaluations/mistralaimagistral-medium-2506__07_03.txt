- The LLM answer contains all and only the correct differences.
- However, it does not strictly adhere to the required format in three significant ways:
    - The headings are prefixed with "- **...**" instead of plain, unformatted headings as instructed.
    - For added/removed tasks, the answer omits the required hyphen before each task (`-`) and does not strictly follow the stipulation of "id followed by the name in parentheses" as a bulleted list.
    - Gateway changes are not presented with aligned colons and spacing, and lack the required indentation.
- These formatting deviations, although the factual content is accurate, represent concrete noncompliance with strict instructions and thus merit significant point deduction.
