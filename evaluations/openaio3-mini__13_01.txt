The LLM answer matches the ground truth closely across all questions: exact count and percentage calculations are identical; the case identifier is correctly specified; and the two reasons provided for question 4 align directly with two of the specified ground truth options (small sample size and temporal bias), stated clearly without deviation, inference, or hallucination from the log fragment. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "single day" vs. "morning of 1 May 2025") do not introduce errors, as the log supports the description.
