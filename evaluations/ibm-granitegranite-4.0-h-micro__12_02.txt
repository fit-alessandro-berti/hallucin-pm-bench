The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid justification citing line 11 and case C005, which disproves the "always" claim by showing an instance where Validate_Payment occurs without any preceding Receive_Order. However, under strict evaluation, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it omits the critical counter-example in case C003 (lines 6-7), where Validate_Payment explicitly precedes Receive_Order within the same case sequence, a direct and prominent violation highlighted in the ground truth. This partial coverage introduces a meaningful difference in thoroughness and citation of evidence, reducing alignment despite the overall accuracy on the binary decision.
