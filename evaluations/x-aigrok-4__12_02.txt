The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a concise, one-paragraph justification that accurately cites the two key counterexamples (C003 and C005) with precise line numbers, mirroring the ground truth's reasoning on violations of the "always follows" claim. It demonstrates strong fidelity to the log data without introducing extraneous information or errors in fact. A minor deduction applies for slightly less precise wording in the C005 example ("no prior Receive_Order in the case" vs. the ground truth's explicit "never contains Receive_Order at all"), which could subtly imply the possibility of a subsequent Receive_Order (though none exists in the log), but this does not materially alter the correctness or completeness of the response.
