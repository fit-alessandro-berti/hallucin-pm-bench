The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and clearly cites both counterexamples (C003, C005) with correct line numbers (6/7 for C003 and 11 for C005). The justification is concise, directly referencing the event order and demonstrating the violation of the claim, fully matching the reasoning in the ground truth. However, it could have been slightly clearer in stating that in C005, *Receive_Order* never occurs (not just that Validate_Payment appears "first"), and explicitly that this absence also violates the claim. Because of this minor lack of clarity/explicitness compared to the ground truth, I deduct 1 point.
