8.0

The LLM answer shows strong adherence to the strict vocabulary policy: the required synonyms (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance”) are used exclusively and consistently, and the forbidden terms appear nowhere. The activity sequence and assignments generally match the process as described.

**Errors and issues:**

1. **RACI Formatting and Accuracy:**
   - The ground truth matrix uses R (Responsible), A (Accountable), C (Consulted), and I (Informed). The LLM only uses R (Responsible) and I (“Not Involved”, but in RACI, I is Informed). There is no mention or indication of Accountable (A) or Consulted (C) assignments.
   - In several activities in the ground truth, “R / A” is used to indicate that Account Manager is both Responsible and Accountable, while the LLM answer only assigns R. Thus, it fails to indicate accountability.
   - Consulted (C) assignments, present in the ground truth (e.g., Compliance Officer is Consulted in “Receive Application”, etc.), are entirely omitted.
   - For “KYC Review”, Finance Clerk is Consulted in ground truth but marked “I” (not involved) in the LLM answer.

2. **Legend:**
   - The LLM assigns “I” as “Not Involved”, whereas in RACI matrices “I” means “Informed”. This is a minor error, but significant under strict policy.

3. **Activity Naming/Order:**
   - Very minor formatting difference but the sequence and activities are correctly matched.

**Summary:**
- The vocabulary compliance and mapping of tasks are correct.
- Critical RACI roles (A, C) are missing throughout; this omits a substantive part of the required answer.
- There are a couple of assignment mismatches due to missing C’s.
- The legend is slightly inaccurate.

**Impact:**  
For a “strictness” request, these errors represent substantial losses in precision. Therefore, I assign a score of **8.0**: the work is mostly on target, but deducts 2 full points for the lack of A/C assignments and the incorrect I definition.
