The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without any forbidden variants, and it structures a basic table with activities as rows and roles as columns, avoiding extra tasks or roles. However, it fails significantly on RACI correctness: it oversimplifies to only "R" (for the primary handler per the narrative) and "I" (Not Involved) for all others, ignoring standard RACI elements like "A" (Accountable, often assigned to Account Manager), "C" (Consulted), and combined "R/A" designations present in the ground truth. This results in mismatches across nearly every cell (e.g., no "C" for Compliance Officer in Receive Application or KYC Review; missing "A" for Account Manager in multiple rows; incorrect "I" placements like for Finance Clerk in KYC Review). The legend is incomplete (omits A and C), and additions like the title, bolding inconsistencies, and "Terminology compliance verified" introduce minor unwarranted content. These errors—especially the incomplete and inaccurate RACI allocations—deviate substantially from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict evaluation.
