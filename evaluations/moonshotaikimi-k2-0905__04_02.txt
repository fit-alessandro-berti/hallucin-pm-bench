5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification similar and accurate (both note the sequence for high-amount PO). No deduction.
- **R2**: Status mismatch (LLM: Compliant; GT: Violated). Justification incorrect—LLM uses initial approvals (event 3) but ignores R5's new approval requirement (event 8 on 2025-03-07), making Ship_Goods (event 5 on 2025-03-05) non-compliant as it precedes the final approval by more than 2 days. Major error; significant deduction.
- **R3**: Status matches (Violated). Justification accurate (both note Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods, with correct event/date sequencing). No deduction.
- **R4**: Status matches (Not Applicable). Justification essentially identical (hazardous=false, no inspection needed). No deduction.
- **R5**: Status mismatch (LLM: Compliant; GT: Violated). Justification incorrect—LLM focuses only on Store_Goods after new approval but ignores "any further processing step," as Ship_Goods (5), Receive_Goods (6), and Pay_Invoice (7) occur post-Change_Request (4) but pre-new Manager_Approval (8). Major error; significant deduction.
- **R6**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification similar (ends with Archive_Record). No deduction.
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT). Correct due to at least one violation detected, but LLM under-identifies issues (misses R2/R5 violations).
- **General Notes**: Format mostly adheres (concise justifications ≤20 words), but two critical rule misinterpretations (inter-rule dependencies via R5) show incomplete analysis. Strict scoring reflects ~33% rule errors as substantial inaccuracy, docking from 10.0 despite partial correctness.
