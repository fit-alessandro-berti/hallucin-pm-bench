4.0

Rationale:

- **R1 (Compliant):** Correctly identified as compliant with suitable justification.

- **R2 (Compliant – Should be Violated):** Incorrectly claims “Compliant.” The model checks Ship_Goods vs. the first approvals, not noticing that a new Manager_Approval was required after the Change_Request, thus restarting the approval timeline for "expedited" shipment. This is a substantive error—ground truth says “Violated.”

- **R3 (Violated):** Correctly states violation; clear justification.

- **R4 (Not Applicable):** Correct.

- **R5 (Compliant – Should be Violated):** Incorrect. The model fails to notice that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred *before* the new Manager_Approval, which violates the rule. Ground truth says “Violated.”

- **R6 (Compliant):** Correct.

- **Conclusion (Overall NON-COMPLIANT):** Correct.

Overall, 3/6 rules (R1, R3, R4, R6) are scored correctly, but **R2 and R5 have major misclassifications** and critical reasoning oversights for compliance context, which is a significant failure for an audit setting. Even with the correct overall conclusion, the detailed rule analysis errors are serious and would mislead an auditor.

**Each major rule error results in substantial points lost. Minor phrasing issues are present (justifications occasionally imprecise), but main loss is due to the substantive misapplication of R2 and R5.**

**Strict grading as requested:**  
**Score: 4.0/10**
