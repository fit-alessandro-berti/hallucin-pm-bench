**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Criteria)
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, completeness, validity, and format, warranting a low score under utmost strictness. Key differences:

- **Missing core elements (fatal, -4.0 pts)**: No `<task id="t5" name="Forward to Specialist"/>` (explicit in lines 5-6). No `sequenceFlow` from `reset`/`t2` to `confirm`/`t6` (password reset path dead-ends, invalid BPMN).
- **Incorrect flow modeling (-2.0 pts)**: `gw2` has two outgoing flows (`flow6`, `flow7`) *both* to `resolve` (duplicate targets, semantically wrong; ignores distinct "Resolve Issue" vs. "Forward to Specialist" then "Resolve Issue").
- **Invented content (-1.5 pts)**: Complex, unmentioned conditions (e.g., `$ticket.type == "Password Reset"`, `$diagnosis == "Needs Specialist"` vs. ground truth's simple `yes`/`no`). Unnecessary `xmlns:bpmndi` (prompt forbids diagram elements).
- **Format violations (-0.5 pts)**: Not a "single `<definitions> … </definitions>` block" (preceded by intro text, followed by "Key features" list/markdown). Exceeds "≤ 40 lines" intent with verbose conditions/prose.
- **Minor mismatches (-1.0 pts cumulative)**: IDs/names differ (e.g., `classify` vs. `t1`/`Auto-Classification`; `gw1` name "Ticket classification" vs. "Password Reset?"; no `<?xml>`; process `id`/name differ; end name casing).
- **Gateway count**: Matches ground truth (3 needed despite prompt's "two"), but modeling wrong.

Partial credit for correct loop (`gw3` → `diagnose`/`t3`), basic skeleton (start/classify/gw1/reset/diagnose/resolve/confirm/end), and concise IDs. Total structural/functional errors make it non-equivalent (~70% deviation).
