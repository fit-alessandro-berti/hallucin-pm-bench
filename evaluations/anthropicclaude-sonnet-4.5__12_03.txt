The LLM answer is fully accurate, correctly identifies "No" as the response, and provides a comprehensive, case-by-case justification that mirrors the ground truth in content, evidence citation (all relevant CaseIDs and sequences), and conclusion (emphasizing counterexamples to the "always" claim). The only differences are stylistic (e.g., bullet points vs. table format), which do not affect factual correctness or completeness under the strict evaluation criteria. No errors or omissions are present.
