7.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly for Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 (no differences, full accuracy). However, Q5 has significant errors: it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77) and omits "Validate_Order" (which never starts a case and should be included). The list shares two correct items ("Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") but fails to fully capture the required activities, violating the strict fact-based extraction from the log. Under utmost strictness, this partial mismatch in a key analytical question warrants a substantial deduction from a perfect 10.0, resulting in 7.0 for 80% overall correctness.
