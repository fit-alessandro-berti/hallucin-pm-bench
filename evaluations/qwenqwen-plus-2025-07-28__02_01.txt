8.0

The LLM answer is almost perfect, but there is a significant error in Q5:

- For Q5, the LLM incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" among activities that never start a case, but "Quality_Check" does appear as the first event of case "C-77". The correct answer should have "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", and "Ship_Order".
- All other answers (Q1â€“Q4) are correct and match the ground truth.

Given the instruction for strictness and significant penalty for even small mistakes, this single but non-trivial Q5 error reduces the score considerably from perfect, but as all other answers are correct, I assess 8.0.
