**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all questions, with no errors, hallucinations, missing elements, or fabrications. Content matches ground truth precisely:

- **Q1**: Correct count (3); listing cases is accurate and directly verifiable from the log (no deduction, as it enhances precision without contradiction).
- **Q2**: Exact sequence match for C002.
- **Q3**: Exact distinct activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), immediately preceding Ship_Order per case sequences, listed one per line and alphabetically ordered (A before C).

Minor formatting variations (e.g., Q1 phrasing, Q3 lack of "-" bullets) are stylistic, not factual differences; the prompt specifies content and structure met exactly. No point loss under strict factual evaluation.
