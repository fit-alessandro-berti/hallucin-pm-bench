The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses Rule 3 (violation) and Rule 4 (satisfied). However, it contains major errors in evaluating Rule 1 (incorrectly claims violation due to misinterpreting the order as "out of order" when QE at position 3 precedes RA at position 5, satisfying the rule) and Rule 2 (incorrectly deems it violated based on the flawed Rule 1 assessment, despite VP at position 6 correctly following both QE and RA for high severity). These factual inaccuracies in two core rules represent substantial deviations from the ground truth, warranting a significant deduction despite partial correctness elsewhere. The justification format is informal but references rules, though the errors undermine its reliability.
