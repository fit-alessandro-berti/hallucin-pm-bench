The LLM answer correctly concludes "No" (not compliant) and identifies rule 3 as violated because `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`. It also correctly marks rule 4 as satisfied.

However, there are notable inaccuracies:
- **Rule 1**: The LLM marks this as "violated" and claims QE and RA are not in order, but actually, QE (position 3) comes before RA (position 5), and both occur onceâ€”so rule 1 is satisfied.
- **Rule 2**: The LLM claims violation "due to rule 1," but there is no actual ordering error regarding VP; VP (position 6) does come after both QE (3) and RA (5) as required, so rule 2 should be marked as satisfied.
- The ground truth answer accurately explains that only rule 3 is violated, and rules 1, 2, and 4 are satisfied.

The LLM answer confuses the ordering of QE and RA, which is a significant mistake, and imposes a cascading error onto rule 2. These errors cause a loss of 4 points, despite the correct final decision and accurate identification of the actual compliance issue in rule 3.
