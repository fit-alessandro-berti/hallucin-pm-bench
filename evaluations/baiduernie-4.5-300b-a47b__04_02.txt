6.5

- **R1**: Correct assessment (**Compliant**), justification accurate and reflects order and approval for high-value PO. No point deduction.
- **R2**: Marked **Violated**, which is correct, but justification is wrong (states Ship_Goods is >2 days after Finance_Approval; per R5, after Change_Request a new approval is needed, so the interval should be counted from the second Manager_Approval, not Finance_Approval). This is a significant interpretational error. -1.5 points.
- **R3**: Correctly marked **Violated** with an accurate rationale. No deduction.
- **R4**: Correctly marked **Not Applicable** with proper justification. No deduction.
- **R5**: Correctly marked **Violated**, justification explicitly mentions that the new Manager_Approval came after Ship/Receive/Pay; clear and accurate. No deduction.
- **R6**: Correct (**Compliant** with Archive_Record), with accurate reasoning. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Correctly marked as **NON-COMPLIANT**; matches ground truth.

Major error is on R2 (interval calculated from wrong event). Given this strict scoring, such a rules-misinterpretation is a serious flaw (-1.5); otherwise, all other judgments are spot-on. Minor phrasing differences in justifications but within specification (<20 words, covers content).

Final score: **6.5**
