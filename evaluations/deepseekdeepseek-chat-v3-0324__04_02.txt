### Score: 3.5

The LLM answer has critical errors in R1 (incorrectly marked Violated; ground truth is Compliant, as initial approvals suffice per rule wording) and R2 (incorrectly marked Compliant; ground truth is Violated, due to post-change approval on 07-Mar exceeding 2-day window for expedited shipping). These misinterpret rule applications and event sequence, leading to wrong violation tally (claims 3 but lists R1, R3, R5). R5 justification is partially incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice). R3, R4, R6 statuses and justifications are mostly accurate, and overall result matches, but two major rule errors warrant severe deduction for strict compliance auditing. Format is close but lacks table structure implied in ground truth.
