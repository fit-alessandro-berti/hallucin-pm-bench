6.0

Rationale:

1. R1: The LLM answer incorrectly marks R1 as "Violated", with a rationale that indicates it expects another Finance_Approval after the Manager_Approval triggered by the Change_Request. The rule only requires Finance_Approval after the original Manager_Approval, not after a re-approval due to Change_Request. Ground truth marks this as "Compliant". Significant error.

2. R2: LLM marks as "Compliant", but ground truth is "Violated". The issue is Ship_Goods occurs before the final required approval following the Change_Request and the resulting Manager_Approval, so is outside the 2-day window relative to the last required approval. Major error.

3. R3: Correct -- both LLM and ground truth mark as "Violated" with correct justification.

4. R4: Correct -- marked as "Not Applicable" in both, justified by hazardous = false.

5. R5: Correct -- both mark as "Violated" and the reasoning matches: Change_Request after approvals, new Manager_Approval should precede further processing, but Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occur before.

6. R6: Correct -- matched as "Compliant" in both.

Overall:  
- Both answers reach the same "NON-COMPLIANT" conclusion, but **R1 and R2 are wrongly assessed** in the LLM answer, despite being central to the compliance analysis.
- Justifications for R5/R4/R3/R6 are factually correct and concise.
- Small errors in justification editing for R2/1, but the main issues are in rule application and correctness.

Given the major errors in R1 and R2 (40% of rules), and the severity of those errors (misidentification of compliant/violated status in the direction opposite to the ground truth), a strict score must be given. The answer is clear, structured well, and gets half the rules exactly right, but the remaining errors are fundamental.

Final score: **6.0**
