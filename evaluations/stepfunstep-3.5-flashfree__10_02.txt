**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth and prompt requirements on multiple axes, warranting the minimum score under utmost strictness:

- **Table Structure & Format (Major Failure, -3.0 pts)**: Malformed Markdown. Headers only list 2 roles but imply 8 RACI columns (unlabeled/misaligned). Uses "X" instead of standard R/A/C/I letters (no legend provided). Rows are broken (e.g., empty "Task" cells with stray "|      |"). Ground truth has clean, proper Markdown with full headers, bolded primaries, and legend.

- **Roles (Major Failure, -2.0 pts)**: Only 2 roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison), omitting IT Support (explicit in source step 5-6) and ground truth's Operations Manager/IT Support. Violates full coverage; prompt mandates using enforced terms *for activities/roles* but allows source terms like IT Support (as in ground truth).

- **Tasks (Major Failure, -2.0 pts)**: 8 tasks vs. ground truth's 6 precisely mapped ones. Adds extras (6-8: splits step 5/6 arbitrarily, e.g., "Notify Regulatory Liaison" as separate). Wording inconsistent (e.g., no mandated "**KYC Review**" bolding; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"). Omits/combines source accurately like ground truth (e.g., no explicit SWIFT in ground truth as separate).

- **RACI Assignments (Major Failure, -2.0 pts)**: Unclear/undecipherable due to "X" and misalignment. No match to ground truth (e.g., ground truth: TA **R** for Receive/Screen/Release; LLM vaguely "X" under TA). Ignores source mappings (e.g., IT **R** for Archive).

- **Vocabulary Mandate (Partial Credit, but Strict Penalty, -1.0 pt)**: Uses "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison" correctly in places (+1.0 partial), but fails "only" by not enforcing everywhere (e.g., no full substitution in tasks/roles).

Total deviations are pervasive (structure, content, accuracy); even "small" formatting errors (e.g., no bolding, no legend) deduct heavily per instructions. No aspect fully aligns with ground truth's precise, mandated, comprehensive table.
