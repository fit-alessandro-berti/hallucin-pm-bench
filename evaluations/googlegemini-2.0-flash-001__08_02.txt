10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, correctness, and brevity (both under 120 words). It accurately answers Q1 affirmatively, provides the exact minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) with equivalent marking descriptions, and a valid explanation of T5 preceding T3 via the alternative path (T2-T7-T4), consuming P2 before T3 can enable. No factual errors, ambiguities, or deviations; minor phrasing differences (e.g., "in a reachable marking" vs. explicit markings with subscripts) are stylistic and do not affect accuracy or completeness.
