7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed task: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the prompt's requirements for listing only differences without speculation. However, under strict evaluation:

- **Format deviations from ground truth (significant deductions):** 
  - Item presentation reverses the ground truth order (id first in parentheses vs. name first with "id = `id`"), misaligning with XML element emphasis and ground truth structure (-1.0).
  - Headings use markdown `##` instead of bold `**` as in ground truth, and do not match the prompt's exact plain-text style with leading "•" bullets for headings (-0.5).
  - Added unrequired title "# BPMN Change-Log Analysis: RMA Process" (-0.5).
  - Bullets use "•" vs. ground truth's "*" (-0.25, minor but strict).

- **Content omissions:**
  - Gateway change lacks explicit version references "(v1)" and "(v2)" as in ground truth (-0.5).
  - Missing ground truth's closing note "*(No other differences should be reported.)*" (-0.25, though not strictly required by prompt).

No factual errors or additions beyond the prompt, but cumulative small presentation and detail mismatches warrant deductions, preventing a higher score. Overall match: ~75%.
