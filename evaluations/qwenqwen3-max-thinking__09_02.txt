The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise, correctly identifying the impossibility due to absent timestamps and linking it to the need for time durations, directly matching the ground truth's core reasoning. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "time durations" vs. explicit "start-to-completion intervals"; omission of "duration information" and "event counts" references), per strict evaluation criteria.
