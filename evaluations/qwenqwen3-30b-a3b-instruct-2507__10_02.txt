The LLM answer fails to adhere to the core vocabulary mandate by repeatedly using the forbidden term "Payment Clerk" (appears in 3 tasks), directly violating the instruction to use only "Transaction Analyst" for such roles. It also employs an incorrect RACI table structure (roles filled into R/A/C/I columns instead of roles as columns with R/A/C/I letters in cells, as in the ground truth). Task mappings are incomplete and inaccurate: it introduces an extraneous "Notify Regulatory Liaison after archiving" task with illogical assignments (e.g., Regulatory Liaison as Accountable but no one Informed, contradicting the source's implication of notification); splits step 5 unnecessarily while omitting proper integration; and misassigns roles (e.g., Transaction Analyst relegated to Informed only, ignoring its central role in ground truth for receiving, screening, and releasing; no "Operations Manager" at all). Wording deviates (e.g., "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; no bolding for "**KYC Review**" emphasis). No legend provided. These numerous, fundamental differences result in the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
