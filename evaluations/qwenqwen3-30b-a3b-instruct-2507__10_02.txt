3.5

**Evaluation:**

**Positive aspects:**
- The LLM answer generally attempts to use the mandated vocabulary (“KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”).
- The answer does use a RACI format in Markdown.
- Steps roughly correspond to the informal process.

**Strict issues & point deductions:**

1. **Violation of Role Mandate:**
   - The roles “Payment Clerk” and “IT Support” are used in several rows, but only “Transaction Analyst” (instead of Payment Clerk) and “IT Support” are allowed (Payment Clerk must NOT appear). The ground truth also replaces “Operations Manager” with Accountable, but the LLM answer omits it entirely.
   - For “Regulatory Liaison”, the account generally adheres, but “Compliance Officer” and “Payment Clerk” appear in role columns (prohibited terms), losing significant marks.

2. **Task Naming:**
   - The LLM answer sometimes incorrectly paraphrases/mixes process steps (e.g., “Conduct KYC Review on sender and beneficiary” instead of just **“KYC Review”**). Wording MUST strictly match mandates, which was not done.
   - Several tasks are not mapped to the strict mandated wording, while the ground truth strictly aligns to activity nomenclature.

3. **RACI Assignment Issues:**
   - The LLM collapses Responsible and Accountable on certain steps (e.g., both to Regulatory Liaison) where the ground truth carefully separates, and almost never includes “Operations Manager” anywhere as Accountable (a major flaw).
   - The “Transaction Analyst” role is not consistently assigned as Responsible (should have been for Receive Payment Instruction, Screening, etc.).
   - IT Support appears as Responsible on archiving (matches in ground truth), but the LLM omits their “Consulted” or “Informed” presence in other tasks, while ground truth maps carefully.

4. **Structure/Completeness:**
   - The LLM has an extra “Notify Regulatory Liaison after archiving” row, which is not present in the ground truth (and is arguably unnecessary). This wastes a row and demonstrates misunderstanding of the flow.
   - The ground truth columnar structure is clear with the mandated roles; the LLM splits roles and task assignment differently, not matching markdown conventions or the mandate.

5. **Strict Mandate Violations:**
   - The explicit rule “Put table in Markdown” is followed, but numerous column/role designation errors show deviation from the strict mapping required.

6. **Consulted/Informed Assignments:**
   - Often left blank by the LLM, inconsistent with ground truth, which assigns at least one C/I where process logic demands it.

**Summary:**  
Wording and role mapping errors (particularly the re-use of “Payment Clerk”, omissions of “Operations Manager”, and lack of strictly mandated activity wording) are significant flaws based on the strict grading required. Small errors add up drastically here due to the mandate for *exact* terminology adherence.

**Final score: 3.5** (basic structure attempted, but strict vocabulary and mapping adherence are substantially lacking).
