8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: three added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), one removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision. No extraneous or missed changes are included, aligning with the prompt's instruction to focus strictly on the three headings and ignore cosmetics like name tweaks (e.g., "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan") or XML ordering.

However, strict deductions apply for the following differences from the ground truth (resulting in a 2.0-point loss):
- **Task descriptions**: The LLM lists only XML IDs (e.g., "Task_VerifyIdentity") without the human-readable names (e.g., "**Verify Identity**"), which the ground truth prioritizes for clarity in a process-mining summary. This omits essential descriptive context, treating changes as mere IDs rather than meaningful process elements—a small but significant error under utmost strictness.
- **Gateway details**: The LLM uses raw XML tags ("exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway"), while the ground truth employs BPMN terminology ("exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)") with version references (*v1*/*v2*). The prompt's example ("Exclusive → Inclusive") favors the latter style, making the LLM's phrasing less interpretive and aligned.
- **Formatting and structure**: The LLM uses unnumbered bullet points and plain text, lacking the ground truth's numbered lists, bolding, italics, and closing note ("No other additions..."). This reduces readability and completeness, though headings are correctly grouped.
- **Minor phrasing**: Singular "task" for removed items vs. plural "tasks" in heading; no explicit confirmation of exhaustiveness.

These issues make the answer functionally correct but not a precise match, warranting the score. A 10.0 would require near-exact replication of the ground truth's detail and style.
