9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and includes all required changes, grouped under the correct headings. However, it is missing some minor details of ideal formalism and clarity:

- The "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" lists include only the technical IDs, omitting the label (e.g., "Verify Identity"), which the ground truth gives for clarity.
- The "Gateway-type changes" description could be slightly clearer about which gateway (using the technical ID "Gateway_Decision") and mentioning the change (exclusive â†’ inclusive) more formally.

These are subtle presentation/clarity issues, not mistakes in content. According to the strictness requested, this justifies a small but significant penalty. All major information is present and correct: 9.5/10.0.
