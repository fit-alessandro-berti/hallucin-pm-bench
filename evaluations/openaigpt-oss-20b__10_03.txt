3.5

The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms without synonyms or leaks, and formats as a Markdown table without renaming or adding unauthorized elements. However, it fails significantly in completeness and accuracy: it covers only 4 activities instead of all 6 described in the narrative (missing "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"), omits several RACI assignments (e.g., no "C" for Compliance Analyst in Intake Vetting; no "A" for Compliance Analyst in KYC Review and AML Screening; incorrect "I" for Compliance Officer in Risk Scoring instead of "A"; missing "C" for Front-Office Analyst in Risk Scoring), and does not fully involve all roles across activities as required. These omissions and errors represent major deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score despite partial adherence to vocabulary and structure.
