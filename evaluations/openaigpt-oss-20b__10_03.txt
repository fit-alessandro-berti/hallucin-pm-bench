The provided LLM answer is significantly incomplete and deviates from the ground truth in several ways:

- **Missing Activities:** The LLM output omits two required activities—**Compliance Officer Approval** and **Release Funds**—that are explicitly described in the process narrative and are included in the ground truth answer.
- **Incorrect RACI Assignments:** The RACI assignments for several activities are either incomplete or incorrect. For example:
  - For **Intake Vetting**, the LLM only marks the Front-Office Analyst as Responsible (R), but in the ground truth, they are both Responsible and Accountable (R, A), and other roles are Consulted or Informed.
  - For **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**, the LLM fails to pair Responsibility and Accountability where required (R, A for Compliance Analyst according to the ground truth).
  - For **Risk Scoring**, the ground truth assigns Accountability (A) to the Compliance Officer, but the LLM does not.
- **Inadequate Role Coverage:** Several roles are omitted from activities where they should be Consulted or Informed. The table lacks the comprehensive RACI mapping present in the ground truth.
- **Vocabulary Policy Compliance:** The LLM output abides by the vocabulary policy (i.e., only the authorized terms are used), but this is no justification for vast omissions.

**Summary:**  
Despite vocabulary correctness, the LLM answer is notably deficient for omitting activities and failing to align on RACI assignments. Strict evaluation demands severe penalization, hence the low score.
