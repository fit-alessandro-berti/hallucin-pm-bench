9.0

Explanation:

1. Correct.  
2. Correct value (5.56), but omits the percent sign or mention of calculation. This is a small error.  
3. Correct.  
4. Both points are reasonable sampling-related reasons and align with the ground truth, although "small sample size" and "data covers only a single day" could be slightly closer in wording to the ground truth, but the content is present.

Main deduction:
- The absence of a percent sign in answer 2 is a minor formatting error.
- The explanations in question 4 could be a bit more explicitly stated as "sampling-related", but they do clearly identify small n and limited time window, matching the expected points.

Overall: Substantial accuracy, very minor loss for formatting/detail â€” 9.0.
