8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Matches the core fact (1 occurrence) but lacks the explicit word "occurrence" as in the ground truth. Minor wording difference deducts slightly under strict criteria.
- **Question 2**: Correct numerical value and implied calculation, but omits the "%" symbol and the explicit formula/calculation shown in ground truth. This is a small but clear deviation, warranting a notable deduction.
- **Question 3**: Correctly identifies the case but provides a terse list instead of the full explanatory sentence with emphasis ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”"). Lacks completeness and formatting, reducing the score.
- **Question 4**: Provides two valid reasons that align with ground truth options (small sample size and temporal bias), stated clearly. However, the explanations are less detailed (e.g., no mention of variance quantification like ±5.56 pp, or specifics like "morning of 1 May 2025"). Covers the requirement but not to the ideal depth, minor deduction.

Overall, the response is accurate and directly derived from the log without hallucinations, but formatting, phrasing, and detail omissions prevent a perfect score under strict evaluation.
