7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Content Accuracy (8/10):** The LLM correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in the exact order they appear in Process B (Quality_Check with Update_Inventory; Generate_Replenishment_Report with Notify_Procurement). It focuses solely on Process B with no extraneous information about Processes A or C, aligning with the prompt. The additional closing statement in the ground truth ("No other tasks...") is absent but not critical to the core requirement of listing sets.
- **Deductions for Strictness (-2.5 total):**
  - **Notation Error (-1.5):** Uses "⇔" (logical equivalence) instead of "‖" (standard parallelism symbol), which is a meaningful misrepresentation of concurrency, even if the intent is clear. This is more than a minor formatting issue under utmost strictness.
  - **Formatting and Structure Differences (-0.5):** Lacks descriptive labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**" and uses bolding instead of backticks for task names, reducing clarity and exact match to ground truth presentation.
  - **Minor Omissions (-0.5):** No explicit "set" framing or final completeness statement, though these are small, they warrant deduction per instructions on reflecting even small errors significantly.

This score reflects high fidelity to the prompt's intent but penalizes precise mismatches harshly.
