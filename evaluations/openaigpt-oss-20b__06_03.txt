9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both sets of concurrent tasks and lists them in order. The answer omits some explicit details present in the ground truth: namely, it does not specifically label the sets ("Set 1 – first parallel block" and "Set 2 – second parallel block") nor explicitly state that "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." Also, instead of "`X` ‖ `Y`", it uses the arrow (`⇔`) notation, which, while clear, is a small deviation from the ground truth formatting.

These are minor omissions and presentation differences, but according to the evaluation instructions, even small errors should cause a significant loss of points. Therefore, the strict score is 9.0.
