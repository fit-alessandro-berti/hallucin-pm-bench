The LLM answer is semantically and functionally perfect, matching all required content, headings verbatim, task/gateway formats exactly as specified (id (name) for tasks; id: old → new for gateways), and listing only verifiable differences with no extras or commentary. Deduction of 1.0 point for minor formatting differences vs. ground truth: extra blank lines after headings and between list items (spaced-out list vs. compact), and missing alignment padding spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" (5 spaces in ground truth for columnar alignment). These are small whitespace/presentation issues but warrant loss under utmost strictness.
