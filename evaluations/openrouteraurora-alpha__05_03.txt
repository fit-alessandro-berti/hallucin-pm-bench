### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Core solution is functionally identical—adds an interrupting boundary timer event (cancelActivity="true") on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H` duration, connects via sequenceFlow to the existing `Activity_AMReview` (perfectly leveraging the unused escalation path without new activities). Justification is concise, one-sentence, and accurately explains SLA enforcement/escalation.
- **Minor deductions (strict penalties for differences)**:
  - XML: Different element IDs (`Boundary_48h` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`; `Flow_09` vs. `Flow_LateEscalation`; logical but non-matching: -0.3). Missing `name="48h breach"` attribute (-0.2). Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (schema precision mismatch: -0.3). No ordered comments (❶/❷) for clarity (-0.1). Unnecessary ```xml``` wrapper (-0.1).
  - Justification: Slight wording variance ("forces... onto the existing... path... automatic escalation" vs. "routing the timeout to the pre-existing... task"; no bolding/italics on task names: -0.2). Minor typography (en-dash vs. hyphen).
- Overall: Extremely close (95% match), but strict criteria penalize all divergences despite semantic/functional equivalence.
