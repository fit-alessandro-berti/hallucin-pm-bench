The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data without any hallucinations, inferences, or deviations. Question 1 is identical. Question 2 matches the calculation and formatting precisely. Question 3 correctly identifies the single case without unnecessary additions, fulfilling the "list" requirement. Question 4 provides two clear, log-derived reasons that directly align with the ideal examples ("Small sample size" and "Temporal bias"), stated without external assumptions. No errors or losses apply.
