9.7

1. Correct (“1”).
2. Correct calculation and percentage (“5.56%”).
3. Correct case (“A1002”).
4. Both sampling-related reasons are present: (a) "small sample size" matches ground truth, (b) "lack of temporal coverage" reasonably aligns with “temporal bias”; it is articulated as being from only one day, recognizing lack of broader time window.

Deduction:
- Minor markdown (–0.3) for wording: In Q4, “lack of temporal coverage” is acceptable, but “temporal bias” (the ground-truth term) is stronger and more comprehensive; the model did not mention possible case-mix or truncation bias as alternative possibilities, but the instructions only asked for two.
- All substance and quantitative specifics match, with no hallucination or extraneous information.

Therefore, 9.7/10.0.
