The LLM answer is almost perfect but includes one error: for Q5, the LLM listed "Quality_Check" as an activity that never appears as the first event of any case, when in fact "Quality_Check" is the first event for case C-77 in the fragment. All other answers are correct and fully match the ground truth. Given the requirement for utmost strictness and for small errors to carry significant penalties, the addition of a clearly incorrect activity in Q5 warrants a deduction of 2 points.
