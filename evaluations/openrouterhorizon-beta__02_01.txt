7.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1â€“Q4, demonstrating accurate extraction of distinct cases, preceding activity, earliest timestamp, and activity count. However, Q5 incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" in the list, as this activity does appear as the first (and only) event in case C-77. This factual error in log analysis, despite being a single extraneous item, warrants a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria, reducing the score from a potential perfect 10.0 to 7.0.
