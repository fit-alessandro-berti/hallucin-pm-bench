**1.0**

The LLM answer fails critically: it modifies the wrong task (PrepareContract instead of CollectEquipment), applies an incorrect dueDate change (P2D→P1D vs. P5D→P2D), provides an invalid rationale unrelated to the 3-day SLA (alignment with "other tasks" is baseless), includes extraneous introductory text violating the exact output format, uses a non-standard unified diff without @@ hunk headers or matching indentation, and exceeds the one-sentence rationale limit.
