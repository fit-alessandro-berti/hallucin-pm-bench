8.0

The LLM answer is almost perfect, but includes one extra item in Q5:

- Q1: Correct (3)
- Q2: Correct ("Pack_Items")
- Q3: Correct ("2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00")
- Q4: Correct (2)
- Q5: INCORRECT. LLM included "Quality_Check" among activities never appearing as first event, but "Quality_Check" is the first event for case "C-77" in the event log. There are no other errors.

Since Q5 contains a substantive but not egregious error (over-claiming that "Quality_Check" never starts a case when it actually does for one case), this is a significant error but not a catastrophic one. This merits a substantial deduction, but not a fail. Strict scoring with "significant loss of points for even small errors" suggests a two-point deduction for this oversight. 

Final score: 8.0
