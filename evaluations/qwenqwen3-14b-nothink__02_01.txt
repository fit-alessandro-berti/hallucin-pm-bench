### Evaluation Reasoning
- **Q1-Q4**: Perfect match with ground truth (no differences), contributing full credit.
- **Q5**: Partial match but contains a factual error. The list incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77, so it *does* appear as a first event and should be excluded). The other three items ("Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order") are correct, but the inclusion of an extraneous and incorrect item violates the instruction to list *every activity that never appears as the first event*. Under strict evaluation, this error (adding an invalid item) deducts 2 full points, as it introduces inaccuracy in content despite the list otherwise covering the required items (order is irrelevant per schema). No other format issues, but semantic precision is required. Overall, strong performance with one clear deduction for the Q5 inaccuracy.
