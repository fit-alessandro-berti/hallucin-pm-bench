7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Format Adherence**: The LLM answer closely follows the required structure (status + ≤20-word justification per rule, all-caps overall result). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., no table, uses em-dashes) do not deduct heavily, but ground truth uses a table—slight mismatch (-0.2).
- **R1**: Status and justification match closely (both confirm approval sequence for high amount). Full credit.
- **R2**: Major error—status incorrectly "Compliant" (should be "Violated"); justification ignores the Change_Request triggering a new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07, miscalculating the "last required approval" timing (Ship_Goods on 05-Mar is >2 days before final approval and occurs prematurely). Significant deduction (-1.5).
- **R3**: Status and justification match exactly. Full credit.
- **R4**: Status and justification match closely (both cite hazardous=false). Full credit.
- **R5**: Status correct ("Violated"); justification captures core issue (further processing before new approval) but omits Pay_Invoice as an example of violation, unlike ground truth—minor incompleteness (-0.3).
- **R6**: Status and justification match closely. Full credit.
- **Overall Result**: Correct ("NON-COMPLIANT"), as violations are identified (though one missed). Full credit.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: The R2 error is a critical misinterpretation of the event trace and rules (change request's impact on approval sequence and expedited timing), warranting substantial loss despite other accuracies. Total starts at 10, deducts to 7.5 for errors.
