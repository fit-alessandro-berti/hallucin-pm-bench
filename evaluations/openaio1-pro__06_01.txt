The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can run in parallel, in the correct alphabetical order both within pairs and overall. It adheres to the specified format (one pair per line with " â€” "). However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for a small but noticeable formatting difference: the ground truth includes leading whitespace on the second line to align the dashes vertically (creating a code-block-like presentation), which the LLM answer omits. This minor deviation in whitespace alignment is treated as a significant error per the evaluation criteria.
