The LLM answer correctly identifies both pairs of parallel-executable tasks as per the ground truth and lists them in the right format and order. However, the answer does not use the exact spacing seen in the ground truth (no extra spaces between Procure_Materials and — and Schedule_Machines), which, under the strictest standards and as per the instructions to be “utmost strict,” constitutes a minor formatting deviation. For this reason, a small penalty is warranted.
