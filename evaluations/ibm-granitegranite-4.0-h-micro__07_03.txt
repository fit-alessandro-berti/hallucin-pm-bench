### Evaluation Rationale
- **ADDED TASKS**: Partial match (2/3 items correct: Task_FraudCheck and Task_FastTrackApproval). Missed Task_NotifyCustomer, which is a verifiable addition in v2. This is a major omission, as the prompt requires *all* functional changes. Significant deduction for incompleteness.
- **REMOVED TASKS**: Complete mismatch. LLM incorrectly lists Task_RejectClaim (present in both versions) as removed, while the actual removal is Task_ManualReview (present only in v1). This inverts the change entirely, warranting a near-total deduction for this section.
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: Partial match. Correct for Gateway_ReviewNeeded (exclusive → parallel). Incorrect for Gateway_Payment: LLM states "diverging → converging" (fabricating a direction change), but the verifiable change is type-only (exclusive → parallel), with direction unchanged (Converging in both). This misrepresents the element, leading to substantial deduction.
- **Overall Structure and Formatting**: Headings are verbatim but LLM adds unnecessary Markdown bolding (**), while ground truth uses plain text. Lists use consistent "-" bullets, but minor spacing inconsistencies (e.g., extra spaces). No commentary added, which complies, but does not offset content errors.
- **Strictness Applied**: As instructed, factual inaccuracies and omissions are treated severely. The response captures ~50% of the correct changes but introduces errors that could mislead analysis, resulting in a low score. No guessing or advice present, but core requirement of verifiable differences is violated through inaccuracies.
