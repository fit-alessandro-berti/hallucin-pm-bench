The LLM answer is correct in content for all three questions and follows the concise bullet-point format requested. However, under utmost strictness, it loses a full point for Question 1 due to omitting the explicit listing of cases (C123, C456, C789) as shown in the ground truth, which provides confirmatory detail despite the question only asking for the count. No other differences or errors.
