- The LLM answer is very close and provides the correct substance for all questions but lacks the explicit enumeration of the three case IDs in A1. The ground truth specifies listing the case IDs "(C123, C456, C789)", which are absent in the LLM response. This omission is significant given your instruction for utmost strictnessâ€”even small errors matter.  
- "Pack_Items" for A2 and "Cancel_Order" for A3 are both correct.

**Summary:**  
- Minus 2 full points for omitting the explicit enumeration of case IDs in Q1, despite getting the count correct, as this detail is specified in the ground truth.  
- Answers for Q2 and Q3 are precisely correct.
