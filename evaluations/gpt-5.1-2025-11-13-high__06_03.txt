The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the specified order, with no extraneous information about other processes or incorrect tasks. It fully matches the core content of the ground truth. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., lack of descriptive labels like "first parallel block," use of "and" instead of "‖," absence of bold/backticks/formal formatting, and omission of the confirmatory sentence), which under strict evaluation warrant a small point loss despite the substantive accuracy.
