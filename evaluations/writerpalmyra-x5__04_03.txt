**3.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies overall non-compliance ("No") due to Rule 3, matching the ground truth. Rule 3 and Rule 4 assessments are accurate. However, it contains **major factual errors** and misinterpretations:

- **Rule 1**: Incorrectly marked violated. QE precedes RA (QE → NA → RA), satisfying "once each and in that order." LLM wrongly claims "out of order" and implies immediacy is required (not in rules).
- **Rule 2**: Factually wrong—VP occurs *after* RA (trace position: RA 5th, VP 6th). LLM misreads trace as VP before RA.

These are severe trace-reading and rule-interpretation errors (2/4 rules wrong), violating strict evaluation criteria despite correct final answer. Format is acceptable but content differs substantially from ground truth table.
