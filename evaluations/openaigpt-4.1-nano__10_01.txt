The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without any forbidden terms, matching the ground truth on vocabulary and including all required activities and roles without additions. The structure of the table (rows as activities, columns as roles) is appropriate. It accurately identifies the single Responsible (R) role per activity based on the process performers, which aligns with one key aspect of the narrative. However, it fails significantly in completeness and accuracy relative to the ground truth: no Accountable (A), Consulted (C), or Informed (I) designations are provided, leaving 18 of 24 cells effectively blank or incorrect (e.g., no A for Account Manager where appropriate, no C/I for other roles inferred from process flow). The explanatory note admits incompleteness and incorrectly assumes R covers A, introducing minor extraneous content. Under strict evaluation, these omissions and mismatches represent major differences, warranting substantial deduction despite partial correctness on R assignments.
