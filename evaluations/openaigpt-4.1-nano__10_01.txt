7.0

**Justification**:

**Strictness on Vocabulary Policy (0pt deduction):**
- The LLM answer strictly follows the vocabulary instructions: it uses "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" (each with correct spelling and capitalization). It never mentions any forbidden terms.

**Structure and Scope (0pt deduction):**
- No extra columns or roles are introduced. Only the given six activities, four roles, and the required matrix structure.

**RACI Assignments (Significant discrepancies—minus 3 points):**
- **Major Errors**:
  - The LLM answer marks only a single "R" for each activity—failing to denote "A", "C", or "I", and in some cases (like "Receive Application," "Order Vetting," and "Notify Customer") does not reflect the dual "R / A" assignment in the ground truth.
  - For each activity, the LLM strictly puts one "R" and leaves the rest blank. The ground truth, however, assigns multiple roles per activity, distributing "R," "A," "C," and "I" as appropriate (see, for instance, the various "C" and "I" assignments).
  - The ground truth expects Account Manager to be "R / A" for several, not just "R".

**Legend/Clarification (Minor error—minus 0.5):**
- The LLM conflates "Responsible" with "Accountable" in the legend, saying: "assuming the same for responsible here; if needed, can specify further." This does not meet the ground truth's more rigorous separation of R and A.

**Other Notes:**
- The answer stops short of mapping all the responsibilities and accountabilities across each activity, which is central to a correct RACI.

**Conclusion:**  
The LLM answer satisfies the strict terminology policy and maintains the correct process steps and roles. However, it loses significant points (3 out of 10) for not correctly replicating the ground truth’s comprehensive RACI assignments, especially missing the Accountable, Consulted, and Informed roles, and never denoting "R / A" where appropriate. This reduces the score to **7.0** despite strong compliance in other areas.
