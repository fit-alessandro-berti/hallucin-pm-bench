8.0

The LLM answer is accurate in its Yes/No assessment (it correctly says "No") and provides a correct, concise justification by pinpointing the offending cases (C002 and C004), referencing their activity sequences. However, it loses points for these reasons:

- It does not explicitly discuss cases where the FACT holds true (C001 and C003), which the ground truth does. The lack of a complete case-by-case breakdown omits potentially important supporting evidence.
- The answer, while sufficient, is less rigorous and not as comprehensive as the ground truth: there is no table or clear list showing all cases and whether the FACT is violated or not.
- Minor loss of clarity for only mentioning the negative cases, instead of documenting the full landscape of evidence.

These omissions are significant given the requested "utmost strictness," so the answer, while mostly correct, is notably less complete than the gold standard. Thus, 8.0 is justified.
