7.0

The LLM answer accurately identifies all the functional changes (added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway type changes), matching the content of the ground truth answer. However, it suffers significant formatting accuracy issues:

- It omits the dash/bullet "-" before each item as shown in the ground truth under all three headings.
- It does not align the indentation and spacing (especially the alignment under GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES).
- In GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, the second item does not align properly with the task id as in the ground truth ("Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel" does not have spacing to visually align with the first).
- While item content and order are correct, the headings and their exact formatting (uppercase, placement, and colon use) are inconsistent with the ground truth.

While these could be considered minor, the instruction specifies "utmost strictness" and that even small errors should result in a "significant loss of points." Thus, a 3-point penalty is appropriate for these formatting errors, resulting in a score of 7.0.
