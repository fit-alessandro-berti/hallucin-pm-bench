The LLM answer is fundamentally flawed, misreading key facts (e.g., expedited=true, not false; Pay_Invoice date 2025-03-06 precedes Receive_Goods on 2025-03-07; no Safety_Inspection needed for R4 but incorrectly applied shipping rule). Only R1 and R6 partially align; R2, R3, R4, R5 have incorrect statuses, justifications, and rule interpretations. Overall incorrectly deemed COMPLIANT despite multiple violations.
