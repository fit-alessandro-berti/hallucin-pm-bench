The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accurately listing all verifiable differences without additions, omissions, or commentary. It correctly uses the required headings verbatim (ignoring markdown styling, which is a minor formatting deviation not specified in the prompt), task formats, and gateway change notation. The only differences are superficial: added "###" markdown for headings (absent in ground truth) and lack of alignment spaces in the second gateway entry (present in ground truth for visual consistency). Under utmost strictness, these small formatting inconsistencies warrant a minor deduction from a perfect score.
