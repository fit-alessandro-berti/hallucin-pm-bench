9.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer produces a semantically equivalent BPMN 2.0 XML that correctly models the prompt's requirements, including all explicitly mentioned flow elements (e.g., 8 tasks matching the description verbatim or near-verbatim in imperative form, the required gateways, parallel split/join, loop for re-validation, and exactly 2 end events). It avoids hallucinations by not adding unmentioned paths (no invented escalations or errors). The inclusion of the "Check warranty eligibility" task and connecting flow (sf6) is required by the prompt's step 3 and not extra/hallucinated—contrast with the ground truth, which omits this, making the LLM more complete per the prompt without violating "model only... explicitly mentioned."

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for small but strict issues vs. ground truth and BPMN best practices:
- **Naming/verbatim mismatches ( -0.5)**: Start event name ("Customer Submits Online Warranty Claim") and end event names differ in wording from ground truth (e.g., "Process Rejected" vs. "Rejected"); task/gateway names are adjusted to imperative but close (e.g., "Validate the claim" vs. prompt's "validates the claim"—not strictly verbatim). Gateway names added (not required but not wrong).
- **Condition handling ( -0.5)**: Includes empty `<conditionExpression>` elements with comments for branches (e.g., sf3, sf7), which are unnecessary/incomplete and could cause validation issues in tools (no actual expressions); ground truth uses simpler flow `name` attributes ("Yes"/"No") without elements.

Structural variations (e.g., no namespace prefix vs. ground's `bpmn:`, ID casing like "wrc_Start" vs. "wrc_start", `isExecutable="true"` vs. "false", added process name) are cosmetic and semantically equivalent per the rubric (different IDs/whitespace allowed, full credit there). No omissions or extras beyond prompt. Overall strictness applied, but equivalence and completeness warrant high score.
