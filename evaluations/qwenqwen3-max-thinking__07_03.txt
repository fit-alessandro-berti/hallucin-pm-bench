8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: 3 added tasks, 1 removed task, and 2 gateway type changes, with exact IDs, names, and type transitions matching the ground truth and XML diffs. No extras, misses, guesses, or commentary—fully compliant with content rules.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Headings prefixed with unnecessary "- " (violates "verbatim" requirement; 3 instances, -0.5 total).
- Items lack leading "- " bullets (5 instances vs. ground truth format, significant formatting deviation, -1.0 total).
- No alignment spaces on second gateway line (-0.1).
- Minor extra newlines/spacing inconsistencies (-0.1).

Semantically perfect (10/10), but formatting errors deduct 1.5 for non-exact match to ground truth structure.
