3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer attempts to model the required BPMN structure (start event, validation loop with exclusive gateway, eligibility check, warranty gateway, parallel split/join, inventory update, claim close, two end events) and includes the explicitly mentioned "checks warranty eligibility" task (omitted in ground truth, but required by prompt— this is a semantic plus, not hallucination). IDs are prefixed with "wrc_" as required. However, under utmost strictness, the answer has critical flaws leading to significant deductions:

- **Extra content (major deduction: -2.5)**: Includes lengthy explanatory text before the XML, violating the prompt's "Return a single self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document." Only XML should be output.
- **XML syntax and validity errors (major deduction: -2.0)**: Multiple typos ("ingoing" instead of "incoming" in ~10 places, e.g., on tasks and gateways), making the XML unparsable. Incoming references often use element IDs instead of sequence flow IDs (e.g., end events reference tasks directly). Missing sequence flows: no flow from "Send rejection notice" to rejection end event; no flow from "Update inventory records" to "Close the claim"; no flow from "Close the claim" to success end event. This leaves paths disconnected/incomplete, rendering the BPMN semantically invalid.
- **Task name mismatches (moderate deduction: -1.0)**: Not verbatim per prompt. E.g., "Validate claim" (missing "the" from "validates the claim"); "Check warranty eligibility" (gerund "checks" in prompt). Other names like "Request missing information" match bolded text, but inconsistency hurts. Differs from ground truth (e.g., ground adds "the" to validation).
- **Structural/namespace differences (moderate deduction: -1.0)**: Extra/unnecessary xmlns (DC for diagrams without diagram elements); different targetNamespace and definitions ID vs. ground truth. isExecutable="true" vs. ground truth "false." No names on start event or gateways (ground truth provides them, e.g., "Claim complete?"; prompt implies matching text).
- **Minor omissions/extras (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Start event lacks name capturing "online warranty claim" (ground truth has "Online warranty claim submitted"). Eligibility task is "extra" vs. ground truth but correctly added per prompt (no net deduction here). XML ends abruptly with misplaced </bpmn:parallelGateway> tag, suggesting copy-paste error.

Semantically, it captures ~70% of the prompt's flow (parallel activities, loop for incompleteness, rejection path) but fails as a functional BPMN due to parse/connectivity issues. Ground truth is minimal/clean (34 lines, fully connected, no extras) but omits required eligibility task—LLM improves on this but introduces more errors. Baseline 10.0 for perfect match; deductions total -7.0 for broken output.
