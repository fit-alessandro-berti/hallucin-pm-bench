7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with justifications that align closely in substance with the ground truth, including specific event references and explanations of the ordering/distance issues. However, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it omits explicit checks for Rules 1, 4, and 5 (which the ground truth confirms as satisfied), failing to match the comprehensive, rule-by-rule structure of the ground truth. Additionally, there is a minor but notable discrepancy in Rule 3 wording ("four steps later" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"), which introduces slight inaccuracy under strict evaluation criteria. These differences reduce the score from a potential perfect match.
