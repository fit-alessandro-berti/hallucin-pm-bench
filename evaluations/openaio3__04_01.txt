8.3

The LLM answer is mostly correct but misses some important details and completeness per strict evaluation:

Strengths:
- Correctly concludes "Non-compliant".
- Correctly identifies Rule 2 violation: `Risk_Assessment` occurs after, not before, `Ship_Goods` in the presence of `Expedite_Flag`.
- Correctly identifies Rule 3 violation: `Three_way_match` occurs after more than two activities following `Goods_Received`.

Weaknesses (reflecting strictness and significant deduction):
- The answer omits explicit review of Rules 1, 4, and 5. The prompt and ground truth expect *each rule* to be cited, even if only to confirm satisfaction. This is a material omission.
- The answer does not mention that Rule 1 (approval sequence/threshold) is satisfied, which is essential for a thorough and audit-quality response.
- The answer does not mention Rule 4 (Intern directly after CFO) nor Rule 5 (Archive_Record at the end). These both are satisfied in the trace and are expected to be checked and confirmed.
- Minor issue: numbering of justifications uses only two points, where five (one per rule) is the expected (and correct for strict audit standard) format. Even when not violated, absence of explicit confirmation is a deduction.

Therefore, while factually correct in its violations, the omission of explicit checks for all rules and lack of detail reflect a moderate but significant loss of points. Thus:
