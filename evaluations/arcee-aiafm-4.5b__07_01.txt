### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: Completely incorrect (LLM says "None", but ground truth identifies two specific tasks with IDs and names). This is a major factual omission, warranting severe deduction.
- **Removed tasks**: Completely incorrect (LLM says "None", but ground truth identifies one specific task with ID and name). Another major omission.
- **Gateway type changes**: Partially accurate in identifying the type shift (exclusive to inclusive), but the description is wrongâ€”misidentifies the gateway ID (`gw_valid` vs. LLM's vague "Gateway from `RMA_v1` to `approve_return`") and phrasing deviates from XML facts. Minor credit for type detection, but errors in specificity and structure reduce this further.
- **Overall structure and adherence**: Uses required headings but with incorrect formatting (e.g., "None" instead of "(none)" as instructed; bullets instead of listing with IDs/names). No speculation, but fails to report all XML-evident differences, violating the core task. Strict scoring reflects near-total mismatch to ground truth, with only ~20-25% partial utility in one category.
