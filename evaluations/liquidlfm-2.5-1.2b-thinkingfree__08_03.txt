**7.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (matching ground truth) and provides the correct minimal prefix sequence to fire T5 without T3 (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5), aligning with ground truth's lower bound of 4 transitions and markings up to that point. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Significant differences in presented "shortest firing sequence"**: LLM gives a 4-step sequence (stopping at T5, without T3), while ground truth explicitly presents and justifies the 6-step sequence 〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉 as "shortest [...] that achieves this order" (including both transitions to demonstrate T5 strictly before T3). This mismatch on the core requested output loses major points.
- **Factual error in explanation**: LLM incorrectly states "T3, which requires pc=1 (achieved during earlier steps)", but pc=0 throughout the sequence (no T2 or T6). This is a clear, material inaccuracy absent in ground truth.
- **Missing key elements**: No mention of feedback loop (T6) enabling T3 post-T5; no detailed markings table; no justification for shortness (e.g., lower bound proof); less comprehensive "why it works".
- **Minor format/style diffs**: Simplified boxing vs. ground truth's detailed structure.

Core logic sound (80% alignment), but errors/diffs deduct 3.0 points.
