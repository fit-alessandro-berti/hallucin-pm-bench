**10.0**

The LLM answer is correct, complete, and directly addresses the prompt with no errors. It provides a valid firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5, explicitly noting T3 later), accurate marking evolution, and a brief justification focused on T5's enabling condition (p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0 via inhibitor arc). This precisely proves T5 fires before T3 in a reachable marking.

Differences with ground truth (e.g., briefer phrasing, partial sequence stopping correctly at M3 without erroneous T4 firing, no unrequested "must" claim or deeper proof) do not detract, as the prompt requires only "one concrete firing sequence" and "justify briefly"—not a full trace, permanence analysis, or extra steps. The ground truth includes an inaccuracy (T4 cannot fire post-T5 due to p3=0), but evaluation is of the LLM answer's fidelity to the prompt and correctness, which is perfect. No point loss warranted under strict criteria.
