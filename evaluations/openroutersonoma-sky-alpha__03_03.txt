10.0

The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth and fully adheres to the prompt's requirements for BPMN 2.0 XML structure, including all explicitly mentioned flow elements (e.g., it correctly includes the required "checks warranty eligibility" task omitted in the ground truth, without hallucinating extras). Task names match the prompt verbatim, including casing. Minor presentational differences (e.g., element declaration order, flow ID naming, lack of optional names on gateways/flows, default namespace usage, and isExecutable value) do not affect semantic correctness or completeness, warranting full credit under the rubric.
