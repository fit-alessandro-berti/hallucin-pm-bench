9.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth (3). No deductions.
- **Q2**: Exact match to ground truth sequence and formatting (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order; underscores in ground truth appear to be markdown escapes and do not indicate a substantive difference). No deductions.
- **Q3**: Core list matches ground truth exactly in content (distinct activities: Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock, alphabetically ordered, one per line). However, the LLM adds an extraneous parenthetical explanation ("(or when no activity precedes for a case, but here none apply)"), which introduces unnecessary content not present in the ground truth or prompt. This qualifies as a minor hallucination/extra element under strict evaluation criteria, warranting a deduction of 1.0 point overall.

The response is highly accurate overall (near-perfect factual precision), but the strict policy on extras prevents a full score.
