The LLM answer is completely correct and aligns exactly with the ground truth:

- Q1: Correctly answers '3', matching ground truth.
- Q2: The ordered sequence for C002 is correct and uses the exact required separator.
- Q3: The LLM lists both correct activities, alphabetically, each on its own line, and even notes that in this fragment, all "Ship_Order" events are immediately preceded by something (the explanatory parenthesis is non-disruptive and does not add or omit factual content).

No errors or omissions are present; the answer is strictly accurate.
