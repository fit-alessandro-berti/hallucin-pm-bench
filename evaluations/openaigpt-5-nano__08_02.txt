The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 with a valid explanation tracing the path to enable T5 without T3. The Q2 sequence matches exactly (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) and is minimal, with a concise supporting description. However, it deducts points for lacking precise marking states (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}) to verify reachability, redundant "Yes" in Answer 2, and omitting the insight that T5 disables T3 (which confirms precedence in the net's dynamics). These omissions reduce evidential rigor compared to the ground truth, despite staying within word limit.
