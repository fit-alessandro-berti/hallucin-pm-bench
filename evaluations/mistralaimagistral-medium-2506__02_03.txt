8.5

- Q1 matches ground truth closely, with minor phrasing difference ("Distinct cases" vs. direct "3 cases").
- Q2 content is identical ("Pack_Items"), but includes unnecessary descriptive label and quotes, adding verbosity.
- Q3 content is correct ("Cancel_Order"), but adds extraneous "(C789)" detail not in ground truth; also includes descriptive label and quotes. Overall, strict evaluation deducts for format deviations and extra information despite correct substance.
