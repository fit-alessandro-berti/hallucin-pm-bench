9.3

- The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth, with only very minor formatting differences:
    - (A1) Adds parentheses for cases instead of the format "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"â€”clear, but less explicit about "cases".
    - (A2) Correct, matches exactly ("Pack_Items").
    - (A3) Correct activity, but adds "(C789)", an extra detail not required, but not factually incorrect.

- No factual/logic errors.
- Formatting is very slightly off (not specifying "cases" in A1, and redundant detail in A3).
- As requested, even small formatting deviations incur deduction; thus, a strict 9.3/10.
