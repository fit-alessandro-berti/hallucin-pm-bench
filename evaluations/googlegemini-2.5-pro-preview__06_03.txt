9.5

The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth, listing the correct concurrent sets, in the correct order, and does not mention Processes A or C. Both pairs of tasks—("Quality_Check" & "Update_Inventory", "Generate_Replenishment_Report" & "Notify_Procurement")—are precisely captured.

However, two minor details lower the score slightly:
- The LLM omits explicit labeling ("Set 1 – first parallel block"), which is present in the ground truth, reducing clarity and traceability.
- The ground truth additionally adds a final clarifying sentence: "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." The LLM does not include this reassurance, which might be important in a strict auditing setting.

Given the requirement for utmost strictness and that even small differences merit a perceptible point penalty, a 9.5 is the most appropriate score.
