The LLM answer proposes an invalid process modification by altering a sequenceFlow's targetRef to an unrelated task (violating flow integrity and the strict "reverse direction" intent), produces a broken BPMN model with orphaned tasks and improper merging without gateways, deviates entirely from the ground truth's precise attribute change (dueDate on CollectEquipment), mismatches the expected single-hunk diff format and location, and provides an unrelated rationale ignoring the 3-day SLA context—complete failure on accuracy, validity, and fidelity to rules/ground truth.
