3.0

The LLM answer introduces a parallel gateway (not mentioned in ground truth and potentially invalid without a corresponding join, risking BPMN execution errors), a new intermediate timer event, and a new end event, which partially adheres to constraints by avoiding new tasks. However, it fundamentally fails the SLA compliance: the parallel timer branch ends the process escalated after 48 hours without ensuring the claim reaches Task_Triage, bypassing the core requirement to triage within the timeframe. Ground truth correctly uses an interrupting boundary timer on Task_Receive to force progression to Task_Triage, reusing existing elements without invalid structure. Major deviation in achieving the business rule warrants severe deduction; minor adherence to format (plain English, brief, some ID references) prevents a full 1.0.
