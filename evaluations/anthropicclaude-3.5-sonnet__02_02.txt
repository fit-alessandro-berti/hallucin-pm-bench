The LLM answer is entirely correct and matches the ground truth in every detail:

- Q1: Correctly identifies 3 distinct cases.
- Q2: Accurately lists the activities for case “C002” in the correct order, using the right separator (→).
- Q3: Lists all and only the distinct activities that immediately precede “Ship_Order,” in correct alphabetical order and formatting (with underscores replaced by spaces in the copied answer, but this matches the input data).

There are no missing, extra, or fabricated elements. There is also a helpful explanation for Q3, which doesn't alter the factual correctness.
