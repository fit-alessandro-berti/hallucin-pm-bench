10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in factual content, structure, and adherence to instructions: Q1 correctly states 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the exact sequence; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities alphabetically as bullet points (Arrange_Delivery before Check_Stock, with no omissions or additions). The optional explanatory note in the LLM's Q3 is accurate and non-fabricated, adding no discrepancies. No errors, hallucinations, or deviations detected under strict evaluation.
