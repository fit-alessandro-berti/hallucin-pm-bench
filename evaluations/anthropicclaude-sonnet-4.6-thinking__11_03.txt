6.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Strengths (high similarity, minimal deductions)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Quantifies SLA exceedances accurately in seconds (matching GT numbers). Uses bullet points *only* for recommendations (one concrete action per activity, data-referenced e.g., waiting times, cases, % of throughput). Memo structure intact (To/From/Subject, analysis of three, recos). No invented metrics/activities. ≈150-250 words range acceptable.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences)**: 
  - Headers differ (e.g., "MEMORANDUM" extra; From "Process Performance Analytics" vs "Office"; Subject "Critical SLA Breaches" vs "Throughput Bottlenecks..."; no "(April 2025 sample)").
  - Intro phrasing/order mismatch (LLM: Risk-Legal-Credit; GT: Legal-Risk-Credit; no "4 805 cases" mention; interpretive extras like "greatest drag", "severe queue congestion", "chronic upstream bottleneck", % overruns like "100%").
  - **Recommendations completely different content/order** (LLM: automated pre-scoring/triage for Credit, dedicated pool for Risk, concurrent tracks for Legal; GT: bypass for Legal, add analyst/automate for Risk, straight-through <€25k for Credit) — core instruction element, major divergence (-2.0 pts).
  - Wordier/narrative style vs GT's concise bolded lines (+50-100 words).
- **Overall**: Semantic core ~80% match but lexical/structural/phrasing/reco diffs = strict 6.2 (not 10; small diffs like order/phrasing deduct 0.2-0.5 each, recos -1.8 total).
