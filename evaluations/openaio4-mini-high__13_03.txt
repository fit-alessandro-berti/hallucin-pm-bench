7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (both confirm 1 occurrence). No errors. Full credit.
- **Question 2**: Covers core concept of sampling bias from small snippet (3 cases, short window) and non-representativeness for full log, aligning with ground truth's emphasis on tiny sample leading to misestimation. Stays under 120 words, no speculation. However, significant deductions for omissions: lacks quantification (14 events, <2 hours, 0%-7% frequency swing, wide confidence interval, extreme error for rare events); ignores near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and strict/fuzzy matching pitfalls, a key data-specific distortion in ground truth; does not reference exact occurrence details (case/time). These gaps reduce depth and fidelity, per strict criteria. Overall ~75% alignment.
