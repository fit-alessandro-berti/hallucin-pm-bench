### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth (GT), capturing all core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with correct logic and terminology from the prompt. It lists all required documents without introducing extraneous standard loan terms. However, under utmost strictness, minor differences warrant deductions:

#### Decision Points (minor deductions: -0.5 total)
- **Strengths**: Identical identification of the three decision points; precise logic (e.g., ≤2 vs. >2 point differences, auto-approval thresholds, board vote outcomes); uses exact activity names (e.g., "Harmonisation Committee", "Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
- **Differences (small errors)**:
  - Includes step numbers (e.g., "Step 5") and verbose triggers/logic (e.g., explicit "continues immediately to the Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which GT omits for conciseness.
  - Omits flow context from GT: "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check".
  - Minor formatting variance: Bulleted sub-logic vs. GT's italicized inline summaries; capitalizes "*approve* or *reject*" differently from GT's "**Approve** or **Reject**".
- These additions and omissions introduce slight verbosity and incomplete flow specificity, reflecting small inaccuracies relative to GT's brevity.

#### Required Documents (minor deductions: -0.3 total)
- **Strengths**: Complete, exact list matching GT's items and prompt terminology (e.g., "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet", "Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)"); no additions or standard loan terms.
- **Differences (small errors)**:
  - Wording variances: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. GT's "(≤ 3 months)"; "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. GT's "(pay-stub/tax slip)" (adds "single" and "or", absent in GT); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. GT's "(CIS)" (adds "template").
  - Formatting: Bulleted list vs. GT's numbered; lacks GT's closing note on excluded standard documents (e.g., "No credit bureau report...").
- These are precise but non-identical phrasings, treated as small errors per strict criteria.

Overall, the response is comprehensive, faithful to the prompt, and differs from GT primarily in detail level and phrasing (no major factual errors or omissions). High score reflects strong match (~92% similarity), with deductions only for the noted minutiae to enforce strictness.
