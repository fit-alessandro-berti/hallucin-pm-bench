### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary mandate (correctly using "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst") but deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, roles, task breakdown, and RACI assignments, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Structure and Format (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: The LLM uses a non-standard RACI format with R/A/C/I as columns and roles filled dynamically in cells (e.g., all empties as "-"), while the ground truth uses roles as fixed columns with R/A/C/I letters in cells, bolding for R/A, and a clear legend. This inverts the typical matrix layout and omits the legend, reducing clarity.

- **Roles (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM omits the critical "Operations Manager" role, which is Accountable (A) for all tasks in the ground truth. It also redundantly repeats roles in cells without distributing responsibilities (e.g., no C or I except in the final row). IT Support is present but underutilized compared to ground truth.

- **Task Breakdown and Wording (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: The LLM introduces extra/ fragmented tasks (e.g., separate "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent," "Archive the case file," and "Notify Regulatory Liaison," creating 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6 consolidated ones). Wording differs (e.g., "Receive and log customer’s transfer instruction in the system" vs. concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; no "(mandated wording)" header emphasis). The source's step 5 (release + SWIFT) and step 6 (archive + notify) are mishandled, leading to duplication and omission of integrated flows. While "KYC Review" is used correctly, other tasks lack mandated phrasing where applicable.

- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -2.5 points)**: Assignments rarely match; the LLM overly simplifies by assigning R and A to the same single role per task with no distribution (e.g., Screening: only Transaction Analyst R/A vs. ground truth's Transaction Analyst R, Regulatory Liaison A, Operations Manager I, IT Support C). No task aligns fully—e.g., KYC Review in LLM is solely Regulatory Liaison R/A, ignoring ground truth's Consulted (Transaction Analyst) and Informed (IT Support). This ignores collaborative aspects evident in the source and ground truth.

Minor positives (e.g., Markdown table, vocabulary compliance for specified terms, covering source steps without invention beyond splitting) add negligible offset (+1.0 total). Overall, the answer captures ~30% of the ground truth's intent but fails on precision, completeness, and fidelity, justifying a low score. Even small mismatches (e.g., empty cells vs. explicit letters) compound under strictness.
