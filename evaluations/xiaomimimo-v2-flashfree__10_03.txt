**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Activities mismatch**: Includes 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6. Adds unauthorized activities ("Escalation for high-risk cases", "Schedule payment (low-risk)", "Notify originating analyst") not matching ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". Renames "Release funds" without exact match.
- **RACI assignments incorrect**: Nearly every cell differs. E.g.:
  | Activity | Key differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Front-Office: R (GT: **R, A**); Compliance Officer: A (GT: –); misses Comp Analyst C, Treasury I. |
  | KYC Review | Comp Analyst: R (GT: **R, A**); Comp Officer: A (GT: C); misses Treasury I. |
  | AML Screening | Identical pattern of errors as KYC. |
  | Risk Scoring | Comp Analyst: R (GT: R, but Front C present); misses Front C, Treasury I. |
  | Others | Non-matching rows with invented assignments. |
- **Formatting errors**: Uses full words ("Responsible", "Accountable") vs. ground truth abbreviations (**R, A**, C, I). Single entries vs. combined **R, A**. Hyphens (-) vs. em-dashes (–). No bolding on **R, A** cells. Poor column padding.
- **Vocabulary**: Correctly uses the 4 mandated terms exactly (minor positive, insufficient to offset).
- **Coverage**: Fails to cover "every activity and role" per ground truth interpretation; adds/merges/renames in violation of "do not rename, merge, or add".

Even minor discrepancies (e.g., formatting) incur significant loss; cumulative major errors make this non-compliant.
