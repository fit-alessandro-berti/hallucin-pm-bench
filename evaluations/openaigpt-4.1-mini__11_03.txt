6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Identification of three worst-performing activities (jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting time)**: Matches ground truth exactly (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment). Strong alignment here, grounding in data (breaches and waits) without invention. No deduction.
- **Quantification of SLA exceedance**: Nearly identical—both specify throughput vs. SLA with exact excesses (+300s for Legal/Risk, +60s for Credit) and include waiting times. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., LLM uses "averaging 900 seconds throughput time"; GT uses "average throughput 900 s vs. 600 s SLA") are cosmetic but reflect slight less concise formatting in LLM. Minimal deduction (-0.2).
- **Structure and formatting**: Both use executive memo format with To/Subject. LLM uses numbered list for activities (not ideal for "memo text" flow) vs. GT's integrated bolded paragraphs—feels less polished. Bullet points used only for recommendations in both, as required. LLM lacks "From" line and total cases mention (GT has "4 805 completed cases," derived from data), making it less comprehensive. Deduction for incomplete header and flow (-0.8).
- **Recommendations**: Major weakness—must be "one concrete, data-driven action" per activity, grounded in data. LLM's are vague/generic (e.g., "Implement targeted process optimization or resource reallocation"; "Introduce parallel processing") with weak data ties (only references waiting times broadly). GT's are highly concrete/specific (e.g., "Introduce rule-based pre-checks so low-risk files bypass"; ties to process steps, though GT invents unsubstantiated details like "€25 k" and "35% reduction," violating "no invented metrics"). Despite GT's own flaws, LLM's lack specificity/data-driven concreteness, failing a core requirement. Significant deduction (-2.0).
- **Overall memo quality (length, grounding, no inventions)**: ≈120 words (close to 150 target). Fully grounded—no absent activities/metrics invented. Returns only memo text, as required. No criminal/jailbreak issues. But lacks GT's executive polish (e.g., projections, sample period) and feels less actionable. General deduction for brevity and vagueness (-0.5).

Total: Starts at 10.0, deductions yield 6.5. Strict per instructions—vague recommendations alone warrant substantial loss as they undermine the memo's purpose.
