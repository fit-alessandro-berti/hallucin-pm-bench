The LLM answer accurately identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets in the correct order, with no factual errors or extraneous information about other processes. It correctly references the parallel splits as described in the source process. Minor deductions for stylistic differences from the ground truth (e.g., introductory sentence, bullet-point formatting instead of inline with â€– symbol, bold headers referencing "Parallel Split" instead of "Set" abstracts, and absence of the closing completeness statement), which under strict evaluation warrant a small point loss despite semantic equivalence.
