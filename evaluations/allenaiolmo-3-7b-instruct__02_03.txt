4.5  
- Q1: Minor deduction for lacking case list/detail vs. ground truth (just "3" vs. "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"), though concise and numerically correct.  
- Q2: Major error—wrong activity ("Validate_Order (C456)" vs. "Pack_Items"); incorrect chronologically and adds extraneous "(C456)".  
- Q3: Exact match ("Cancel_Order").  
Overall: Strict scoring penalizes factual inaccuracy heavily (one fully wrong answer outweighs partial correctness).
