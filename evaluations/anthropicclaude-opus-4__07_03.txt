8.5

Reasoning:
- The LLM answer accurately identified all ADDED TASKS and REMOVED TASKS, matching the ground truth perfectly.
- In the GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES section, the LLM formatted Gateway_Payment as "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel", while the ground truth used "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" (with extra spaces before the types for alignment).
- The omission of whitespace alignment between the id and the change is a minor formatting inconsistency with the ground truth, which, according to strict grading, merits a notable deduction but not a drastic one, as all concrete information is otherwise correct. 
- Structure and order are fully adhered to.
- Thus, 1.5 points are deducted for the small but present formatting discrepancy.
