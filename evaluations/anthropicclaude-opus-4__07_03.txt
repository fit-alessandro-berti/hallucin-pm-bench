The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, structure, and required format, including the precise phrasing for tasks and gateways as per the example (`id: old type â†’ new type`). The minor whitespace difference in the second gateway line of the ground truth (extra spaces for visual alignment) is not specified as required in the prompt and does not constitute an error, as the LLM adheres to the provided example without deviation. No other discrepancies exist.
