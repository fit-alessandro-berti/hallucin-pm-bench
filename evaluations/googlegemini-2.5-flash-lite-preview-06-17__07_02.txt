### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes (added: Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject; removed: Task_RejectLoan; gateway: exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision) with no factual inaccuracies or omissions of changes, adhering strictly to the three headings and ignoring non-structural elements like name tweaks. However, under utmost strictness:
- **Format mismatches** (-1.0): Uses bullet points (*) instead of numbered lists (1., 2., 3.); presents IDs before names (e.g., `Task_VerifyIdentity` (Verify Identity)) versus GT's name-first bolding (e.g., **Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)); adds an unnecessary introductory sentence ("Here's a summary...") not in GT; uses ### for headings while GT uses * **Heading**.
- **Gateway description incompleteness** (-0.5): Lacks GT's precise terminology like "(XOR)" for exclusive, "(OR)" for inclusive, and explicit "in *v1* to ... in *v2*" references, making it slightly less detailed.
No deduction for the missing confirmatory note in GT, as it's not core content. Overall, high fidelity in substance but penalized for stylistic and minor descriptive deviations.
