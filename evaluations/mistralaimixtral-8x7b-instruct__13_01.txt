9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Q1 (weight ~25%)**: Correct count (1). Minor phrasing difference ("1 time" vs. "1 occurrence"); deduct 0.1 for non-exact match.
- **Q2 (weight ~25%)**: Exact percentage (5.56%) and correct calculation shown. Minor extra details (0.0556, ≈); deduct 0.1 for verbosity beyond ideal conciseness.
- **Q3 (weight ~25%)**: Correct identifier (A1002). Phrasing close but imperfect ("is A1002" vs. "Only case A1002 contains"; awkward plural "identifier(s)" with singular "is"); deduct 0.3 for grammar/style mismatch.
- **Q4 (weight ~25%)**: Provides two clear, valid sampling reasons directly derivable from log (small sample size matches exactly; "non-random/single day" strongly aligns with "temporal bias" as a short/sequential window vs. monthly random). Lacks ground truth's extra specifics (e.g., "four cases", variance example, "±5.56pp"); deduct 0.4 for less precise elaboration.
- **Overall**: No hallucinations/inferences beyond log. Sticks to facts, case-sensitive, answers all. High fidelity (92%) but strict deductions for phrasing, grammar, and Q4 depth result in 9.2 (not 10.0).
