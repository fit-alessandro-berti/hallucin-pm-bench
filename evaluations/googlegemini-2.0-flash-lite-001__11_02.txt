6.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Identification of three worst-performing activities (max 3.0 points)**: Correctly matches ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), with clear prioritization. Full credit: 3.0.
- **Explanations of under-performance (max 4.0 points)**: Mostly accurate and table-based, citing key metrics (e.g., wait times, rework, SLA breaches, processing times) without hallucinations or extraneous activities. However, factual error in claiming Initial_Assessment has the "second highest SLA breach" (it is third at 3.2%, behind Request_Documents' 5.5% and Review_Documents' 12.4%); omits throughput drop for Request_Documents. Strict deduction for inaccuracy and incompleteness: 3.1/4.0.
- **Recommendations (max 3.0 points)**: Each provides one action, but they are insufficiently concrete and data-driven per task (e.g., "streamline by reviewing template" lacks metrics like GT's "halve rework"; "investigate root cause" is diagnostic, not actionable; "reduce queueing and provide training" is generic without specifics like GT's "auto-route" or projected impacts). No overall projection or flow ties. Significant deduction for vagueness: 1.6/3.0.
- **Overall adherence (conciseness, format, word limit)**: Under 200 words (~150), executive style, no off-table mentions. Minor extras (full memo header, date) not in GT but not disqualifying: neutral.
- **Total**: 7.7 base adjusted down for strictness on errors/vagueness (-1.5). Ground truth is more precise, measurable, and integrated; differences in depth and accuracy warrant this score.
