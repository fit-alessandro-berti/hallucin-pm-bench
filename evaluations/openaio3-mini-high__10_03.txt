### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer adheres strictly to the vocabulary policy (correct use of "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring" with no disallowed terms leaking in), which is a minor positive. However, under utmost strictness, the evaluation reveals critical flaws warranting a very low score:

- **Added, renamed, and merged activities (major violation of "do not rename, merge, or add activities")**: The ground truth identifies exactly 6 activities. The LLM adds 3 unauthorized ones ("Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification") and renames "Release Funds" to "Funds Release". This alone is a structural failure, as the prompt mandates covering *only* activities from the narrative without additions. "Payment Scheduling" and "Notification" are implied but not distinctly listed in the ground truth, confirming overreach. Penalty: Severe (e.g., -4.0 points).

- **RACI assignments (widespread inaccuracies)**: Nearly every cell differs significantly from the ground truth. Examples:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Correctly assigns R/A to Front-Office Analyst but omits C (Compliance Analyst) and I (Treasury Ops); uses empty cells instead of "–" for no involvement.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: Assigns R/A solely to Compliance Analyst, missing C (Compliance Officer) and I (Treasury Ops).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Incorrectly assigns full R/A to Compliance Analyst; ground truth splits as R (Compliance Analyst), A (Compliance Officer), C (Front-Office Analyst), I (Treasury Ops).
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Partially correct (C for Compliance Analyst, R/A for Compliance Officer) but adds erroneous I (Treasury Ops) and misses I (Front-Office Analyst).
  - Added rows ("Payment Scheduling", "Funds Release", "Notification") have no ground truth equivalents, rendering all assignments invalid.
  Small errors (e.g., missing "–", no bolding, "R/A" vs. "R, A", empty vs. explicit no-involvement) compound into systemic inaccuracy. Coverage of roles is incomplete/inconsistent (e.g., no involvement shown for some roles in ground truth like Officer in Intake Vetting). Penalty: Severe (-4.0 points).

- **Formatting**: Markdown table is produced, but lacks bolding for activities, uses slashes ("R/A") instead of commas ("R, A"), and empty cells instead of "–". Minor but deducts under strictness (-0.5 points, though amplified by content issues).

Overall alignment to ground truth is poor (~25% match on core elements like the first 4 activities' partial RACI). No role/activity is fully accurate, violating the prompt's intent for precise, non-expansive coverage.
