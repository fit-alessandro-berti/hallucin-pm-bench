- **Vocabulary Compliance:** The LLM answer correctly used only the authorized vocabulary for all four core activities. No disallowed synonyms appear. However, there are some unnecessary deviations, e.g., "Notification" and "Payment Scheduling," which are not activities listed in the ground truth nor explicitly authorized by the process narrative.
- **Activity List:** The LLM wrongly introduces two unauthorized activities: "Payment Scheduling" and "Notification." Also, "Release Funds" is split into "Funds Release" and "Payment Scheduling," which is a merge/split not permitted by the instructions or the prompt. The "Compliance Officer Approval" activity is kept, which is correct.
- **Role Assignments:** The matrixâ€™s RACI assignments significantly diverge from ground truth. Multiple Responsible/Accountable (R/A) links are collapsed into single cells (e.g., "R/A" instead of "R, A"), contrary to ground truth formatting.
    * For "Intake Vetting," no C (Consulted) for Compliance Analyst or I (Informed) for Treasury Ops, both of which are required.
    * For "KYC Review" and "AML Screening," the matrix does not show C for Compliance Officer or I for Treasury Ops.
    * "Risk Scoring": LLM makes both Responsible/Accountable the Compliance Analyst, while the ground truth distinguishes Accountability to Compliance Officer.
    * For "Release Funds," LLM has "Funds Release" as "R/A" for Treasury Ops, but fails to mark consulted/informed for others.
    * "Notification" is not a relevant activity as per the prompt or ground truth.
- **Formatting:** The output uses "R/A" to mean "Responsible and Accountable" but the ground truth structure uses "R, A." This is a minor but required distinction.
- **Completeness:** The request was to not rename, merge, or add activities; the LLM adds and splits activities, violating instructions.

**Summary:**  
The LLM strictly followed vocabulary policy, which is good. However, by not faithfully replicating the task structure (splitting/adding activities, deviating RACI assignments, missing "Consulted" and "Informed" for several stakeholder-activity pairs), and by not following the exact list and naming shown in the ground truth, it accumulates a significant point loss. Minor formatting and omission errors also contribute. This yields a strict score of **4.0**.
