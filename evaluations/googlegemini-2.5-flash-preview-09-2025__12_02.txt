The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a solid justification by citing the C003 counterexample (lines 6 and 7), accurately explaining the sequential violation within that case. However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it misses the critical C005 counterexample (line 11, where Validate_Payment occurs without any Receive_Order in the case), which the ground truth emphasizes as a clear proof that Validate_Payment does not "always" follow Receive_Order. This omission represents a key difference, as the claim's universality is further undermined by cases lacking the predecessor activity entirely, making the justification only partially comprehensive.
