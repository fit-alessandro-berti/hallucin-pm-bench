- The LLM answer is correct and concise for all three questions, matching the ground truth in substance (3 distinct cases, "Pack_Items" precedes "Ship_Order" for C456, and "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once).  
- Minor deduction for not explicitly stating "3 cases" or listing the case IDs (C123, C456, C789) in Q1, as the ground truth includes this detail, introducing a small formatting/content difference under strict evaluation.
