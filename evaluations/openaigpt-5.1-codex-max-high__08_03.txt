**6.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" and provides a valid prefix sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) demonstrating T5 firing without prior T3, with a brief correct explanation using the shortcut. However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:

- **Major difference**: Provides a 4-step sequence instead of the 6-step one (〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉), omitting T6 and T3. Ground truth interprets "shortest firing sequence" as one achieving the order *with both transitions firing* (T5 before T3), using the feedback loop; LLM stops early, potentially under-demonstrating.
- **Missing details**: No markings, no step-by-step trace, no explanation of feedback loop (T6 re-enabling T3 post-T5), no proof of minimality (lower bound + why extras needed).
- **Minor issues**: Calls 4-step "minimal" (true for T5 alone, but mismatches GT's full-sequence minimality claim); less structured/formatted (no bolding, numbers, "why this works").

Core idea matches (shortcut enables T5 pre-T3), but structural/sequence/content differences warrant ~35% deduction for incompleteness relative to GT.
