4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the RACI concept, makes partial use of the authorized activity names, and attempts to cover all roles. However, significant deviations from the ground truth and critical policy violations lead to a major deduction in points:

**Vocabulary Violations (Heavy Penalty):**
- "Escalation for Compliance Officer Approval" and "Approval for Payment" are unauthorized activity names, deviating from the required strict vocabulary and activity list.
- "Notification to Originating Analyst" is not part of the ground truth's activity list.
- Slight inconsistencies in "Funds Release" vs. required "Release Funds" phrasing.

**Coverage/Structural Issues:**
- The ground truth specifies only six activities; LLM introduces unnecessary and unauthorized additional activities, against your instruction to not add or rename activities.
- "Risk Scoring" is incorrectly assigned both R to Front-Office Analyst and Compliance Analyst, and A to Compliance Officer; per the ground truth, only Compliance Analyst (R), and Compliance Officer (A)—Front-Office Analyst should only be consultative (C).
- LLM does not distinguish when a role is both Responsible and Accountable ("R, A"), and completely omits the "A" from the RACI assignment for most activities.
- Does not use the dash ("–") for no involvement as required.
- Incorrect or missing consultative (C) and informed (I) assignments compared to ground truth.

**Vocabulary Policy:**
- Does use "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring" in the table, which is correct.
- Does not leak disallowed synonyms in the table itself, but does so in the explanations and activity additions ("Preliminary Assessment", "Sanctions Check", "risk rating", etc.), which the strict policy disallows even in explanations.

**Conclusion:**
The LLM answer shows some understanding but lacks strict adherence to process and vocabulary, adds unauthorized activities/columns, omits roles, and does not correctly reflect RACI assignments. These significant issues justify a substantial loss of points, resulting in a 4.0.
