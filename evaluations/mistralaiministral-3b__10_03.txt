2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth and prompt requirements, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Added and renamed activities (major violation)**: The prompt mandates covering *every activity* from the narrative using *only authorized vocabulary* (the four core terms) without renaming, merging, or *adding* activities. The LLM adds four extraneous activities ("Escalation for Compliance Officer Approval," "Approval for Payment," "Funds Release," "Notification to Originating Analyst") not present in the ground truth, splits concepts (e.g., escalation and approval as separate), and omits/incompletely represents implied activities like "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" as in the ground truth. One row ("Escalation...") is entirely blank/incomplete. This inflates the matrix beyond the narrative's scope and introduces unauthorized phrasings, contrasting the ground truth's precise six activities.

- **Incorrect RACI assignments (multiple errors)**: Assignments differ substantially from the ground truth across all rows, showing misunderstanding of roles:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM assigns only "R" to Front-Office Analyst (blanks elsewhere); ground truth has "R, A" for Front-Office, "C" for Compliance Analyst, "-" for Compliance Officer, "I" for Treasury Ops. Loss of consulted/informed roles.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: LLM assigns only "R" to Compliance Analyst (blanks elsewhere); ground truth includes "R, A" for Compliance Analyst, "C" for Compliance Officer, "I" for Treasury Ops, and "-" for Front-Office. Ignores consultative and informative roles.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM erroneously assigns "R" to Front-Office Analyst (narrative attributes derivation to Compliance Analyst only), "R" to Compliance Analyst, and "A" to Compliance Officer; ground truth has "C" for Front-Office, "R" for Compliance Analyst, "A" for Compliance Officer, "I" for Treasury Ops. Wrong responsibility on Front-Office and missing "I."
  - Added rows have no ground truth equivalents, making them invalid (e.g., "Funds Release" as "R" for Treasury Ops ignores ground truth's "R, A" plus "C" and "I" roles).

- **Formatting and output extras**: The table lacks ground truth's structure (e.g., no bolding on RACI cells, no dashes for no involvement, inconsistent column widths). It includes an unrequested "Explanation" section with factual errors (e.g., claiming Front-Office is responsible for Risk Scoring, combining KYC/AML incorrectly). This adds unsolicited content, violating the "return the matrix as a Markdown table" instruction.

- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit)**: The four authorized terms ("Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," "Risk Scoring") are used exactly once each in the table, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms in the table or explanation. This is the only strong aspect, but it cannot offset the pervasive structural and accuracy failures.

Small errors (e.g., blanks vs. "-", missing "I"/"C" roles) compound to show incomplete fidelity to the process narrative and ground truth, justifying a score well below 5.0. The output is functional but fundamentally unreliable for governance purposes.
