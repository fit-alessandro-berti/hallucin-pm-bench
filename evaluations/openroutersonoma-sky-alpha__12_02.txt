The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides accurate counterexamples matching the ground truth (C003 with reversed order at lines 6-7, and C005 with Validate_Payment at line 11 lacking any Receive_Order). It cites appropriate line numbers and case-IDs in a single paragraph, with no factual errors. However, it deducts a point for unnecessary inclusion of positive examples (C001, C002, C004) where the claim holds, which deviates from the ground truth's concise focus solely on disproving counterexamples, adding extraneous detail that slightly dilutes precision.
