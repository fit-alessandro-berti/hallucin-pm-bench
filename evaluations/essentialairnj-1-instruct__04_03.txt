**3.0**

The LLM answer reaches the correct "No" conclusion and correctly flags rule 3 as violated (NA at index 3 before RA at 4), with other rules properly assessed *for this trace*. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Major format violation (-4.0)**: Prompt requires direct "Yes"/"No" + *short textual justification*; response is verbose Python code (not executable in context, requires mental/runtime simulation), not matching ground truth's concise table/text.
- **Flawed logic (-2.0)**: Rule 1 checks presence/order but ignores "once each" (no `trace.count() == 1`); would pass duplicates. Rule 4 incorrectly allows CC if NA missing (`max(-1, vp_index)` permits CC > VP sans NA, violating "only after NA").
- **Justification differences (-1.0)**: Less precise (no "appears once"/"NA occurs **before** RA"); awkward phrasing; no summary "non-compliant because rule 3"; no table/references as in ground truth.

Correct outcome provides partial credit; bugs/format doom higher score.
