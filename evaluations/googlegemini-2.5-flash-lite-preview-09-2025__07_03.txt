6.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Completeness (major deduction)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (3/3) and the removed task (1/1), but misses one verifiable gateway type change (Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel). This omission of "all" changes warrants a significant penalty under strict criteria, as the prompt demands exhaustive listing of differences without guessing or omission.
- **Format Accuracy (minor deductions)**: Task listings match the required "id (name)" structure. Gateway format uses a colon separator, which closely approximates the example but omits the specified guillemets (« → ») and italics. No bullets (-) are used, unlike the ground truth, introducing a subtle inconsistency in presentation (prompt implies a structured list but does not explicitly require bullets, so this is a small error).
- **Adherence to Instructions (neutral)**: Headings are verbatim and in order; no commentary, unchanged elements, or advice is added, complying with core rules.

Overall, the answer is mostly accurate but incomplete on gateways, justifying a mid-range score rather than higher, per strict evaluation.
