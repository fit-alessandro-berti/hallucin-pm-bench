The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, numbered in order, with no extraneous information about other processes. It adheres closely to the prompt's requirements for conciseness and focus. However, it loses a full point due to stylistic differences from the ground truth: use of curly braces and commas instead of backticks and the ‖ symbol for parallelism notation, and absence of descriptive labels (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**") and the closing sentence affirming no other parallels. These are minor formatting variances but warrant deduction under strict evaluation criteria emphasizing textual alignment.
