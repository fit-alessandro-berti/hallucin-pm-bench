### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (two added tasks, one removed task, and one gateway type change) without speculation or extras, matching the core content of the ground truth. Headings are exact as specified in the prompt. However, under utmost strictness:
- Significant deduction for omitting element IDs (e.g., `check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`, `gw_valid`), which are essential for precise XML-based identification and are explicitly included in the ground truth. This makes the response less factual and traceable to the XML structure, treating "element names" as display names only.
- Minor deduction for using the gateway's display name ("Warranty Valid?") instead of its ID, and not specifying versions (v1/v2) as in ground truth, reducing precision.
- Formatting differences (e.g., bullets vs. asterisks) are negligible, as they don't affect content accuracy.

No other errors, but these omissions warrant a substantial point loss from a potential perfect score.
