7.0

- The LLM correctly identifies all changes in their correct categories.
- The headings are not verbatim as instructed ("â€¢" instead of explicit headings), but this is minor.
- The LLM omits the element ids in the added/removed tasks section, which is a significant loss as the ids are part of the task element "as they appear in the XML."
- The gateway type change section only provides the name ("Warranty Valid?") and does not reference the element id (`gw_valid`), which is required.
- The LLM uses the names of tasks (from the `name` attribute) rather than the element names (ids) as requested.
- There is no speculation or extraneous information.

As per strict grading, omitting the ids in multiple places constitutes a significant point deduction.
