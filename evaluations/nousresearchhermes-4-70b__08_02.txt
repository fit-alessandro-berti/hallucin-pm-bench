The LLM correctly answers "Yes" to Q1, aligning with the ground truth. However, Q2's firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T5) is invalid and demonstrates a critical misunderstanding: T5 requires tokens in P2 *and* P5, but the sequence only produces P4 (no P5 via T4), making T5 unexecutable. This omits T4, renders the "minimal" sequence non-functional, and ignores the ground truth's correct path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) with markings and post-T5 disabling of T3. The explanation misstates T5's preconditions (claims P2 and P4 suffice). Under strict criteria, this fundamental error in the bonus demonstration warrants a low score despite the correct Q1.
