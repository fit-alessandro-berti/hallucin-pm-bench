The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying the overall non-compliance ("No" answer) and correctly assessing Rules 1, 2, and 3 with matching reasoning. However, under strict evaluation, two small errors warrant a deduction: (1) it does not explicitly confirm that QE and RA occur "once each" as required by Rule 1 (implicit but not stated, unlike the ground truth), and (2) it dismisses Rule 4 as "irrelevant" without fully assessing it as satisfied (despite noting the timing correctly), which deviates from the ground truth's complete evaluation of all rules. Format differences (bullets vs. table) are minor and do not impact the score further.
