10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt's constraints. For questions 1-3, it matches precisely in facts and calculations, with only trivial formatting variations (e.g., "1 time" vs. "1 occurrence"; "5.56%." vs. "5.56 %"). For question 4, both reasons clearly articulate two valid sampling issues from the ground truth options—temporal bias (one-day snapshot) and small sample size—without hallucination, unjustified inference, or deviation from the log data. No significant errors or differences exist, warranting full marks under strict evaluation.
