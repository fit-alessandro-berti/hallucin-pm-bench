9.5

The LLM answer is almost perfect, strictly following the data and questions with clear, direct, and accurate responses. Detailed evaluation per question:

1. Correct: "1 time." (identical to the ground truth).
2. Calculation is shown and correct: "5.56%." (Matches ground truth and uses the required rounding).
3. Correct: "A1002." (Agrees with ground truth and does not overstate).
4. Gives two reasons:
   - "The fragment represents only one day’s worth of data..." (Maps well to "Temporal bias")
   - "The sample size is very small..." (Matches "Small sample size")

Both reasons are fully grounded in the provided data and overlap cleanly with acceptable ground truth bullets.

Minor deduction (0.5 points):
- The answer very slightly paraphrases the question's time frame as "one day’s worth" without stating "morning of 1 May 2025" (as in ground truth). While this is a justifiable abstraction, ground truth prefers exactness regarding temporal scope.

Otherwise, the answer is precise, strictly data-based, and avoids unjustified inference.

Final score: 9.5
