The LLM answer correctly concludes that the fact is inaccurate and provides accurate sequences for Cases 1001 and 1003, demonstrating the reversed order (Update_Inventory before Authorize_Refund), which alone disproves the "always" claim. However, it omits Case 1002 entirelyâ€”a significant flaw, as this case lacks Update_Inventory (despite including Authorize_Refund), providing an additional clear counterexample to the universal claim and directly aligning with the ground truth's emphasis on absence disproving "always." This incompleteness in citing all relevant cases and evidence reduces the score under strict evaluation, though the core logic and cited details are precise without fabrication.
