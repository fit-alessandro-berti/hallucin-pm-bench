### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, ~4/10)**: The LLM answer strictly adheres to mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and uses "IT Support" from the source without substitution. However, it introduces non-mandated phrasing in tasks (e.g., "Receive customer transfer instruction & log" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"), and splits "KYC Review" into separate sender/beneficiary rows, which deviates from the ground truth's combined single task. Strict policy requires exact mapping without omissions or additions, so this loses points for imprecision.
  
- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Low, ~2/10)**: The LLM covers all source steps but incorrectly fragments them (e.g., separate rows for sender/beneficiary KYC, standalone "Ensure SWIFT message is sent", and new "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion" row not explicitly in ground truth). Ground truth consolidates into 6 precise tasks without extras. This adds unsubstantiated tasks (e.g., explicit notification as a separate activity) and misses the ground truth's mandated wording/structure, leading to significant deviation. No omissions, but inflation and lack of exactness are penalized heavily.

- **RACI Assignments and Roles (Low, ~2/10)**: Assignments diverge substantially (e.g., ground truth assigns "Accountable" primarily to "Operations Manager" across tasks, which LLM omits entirely—a major role mismatch since ground truth includes it; LLM overloads single roles as both R and A, while ground truth distributes distinctly with letters like **R**, **A**, C, I). Consulted/Informed vary (e.g., for "Screen Against Sanctions List", LLM has Regulatory Liaison as C, but ground truth has IT Support as C and Operations Manager as I). No "Operations Manager" in LLM violates ground truth alignment.

- **Format and Structure (Moderate, ~5/10)**: Markdown table is used correctly, with a descriptive title (bonus for clarity, absent in ground truth). However, the column structure (R/A/C/I with roles filled in) differs from ground truth's (roles as columns with RACI letters). No legend is included (ground truth has one), and bolding/formatting for emphasis is missing. This is a clear structural mismatch.

- **Overall Strictness Penalty**: Under utmost strictness, even minor divergences (e.g., task phrasing, splitting, missing role) compound to a low score. The LLM is functional and source-faithful but fails to mirror the ground truth's exact task consolidation, role inclusion (Operations Manager), assignments, and format—resulting in ~65% deviation. A higher score would require near-identical replication.
