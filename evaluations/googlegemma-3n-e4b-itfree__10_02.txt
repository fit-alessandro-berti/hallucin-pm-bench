5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates a reasonable attempt to follow the vocabulary mandate and provides a RACI table as requested. However, there are several significant discrepancies and errors when compared with the provided ground truth. Here is a breakdown of issues leading to the significant point deduction:

**Major Differences and Errors:**

1. **Omission of Operations Manager:**
   - The ground truth answer includes “Operations Manager” as a key role, being “Accountable” for most steps, but the LLM answer omits this role entirely.

2. **Task Naming Consistency:**
   - The ground truth uses standardized, mandated terminology for steps (e.g., “Receive Payment Instruction”, “KYC Review”, “Archive Record”), while the LLM makes ad hoc task names like “Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion” and splits "KYC Review" into sender/beneficiary subtasks not explicitly specified in the instructions.

3. **Incorrect Role Assignment and Mapping:**
   - In the ground truth, Regulatory Liaison is "Accountable" or "Responsible" for screening and KYC Review. In the LLM answer, these assignments sometimes incorrectly make Transaction Analyst both Responsible and Accountable for “Screen payment against sanctions list,” rather than Regulatory Liaison being "Accountable" as per the ground truth.
   - The Responsible (R) and Accountable (A) roles frequently overlap in the LLM answer for single individuals on the same task, which is generally poor RACI practice and not aligned with the ground truth.

4. **Additional or Unnecessary Steps:**
   - The LLM answer introduces tasks not present in the ground truth, such as splitting KYC Review into sender and beneficiary, “Ensure SWIFT message is sent”, and an explicit “Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion” step.
   - "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" and its placement is not mapped in the ground truth, but is included as a separate activity in the LLM answer.

5. **Incorrect Consultation/Information Relationships:**
   - The Consulted and Informed assignments do not consistently match those in the ground truth—e.g., Regulatory Liaison is not marked as Informed for “Archive case file”.

6. **Format and Structure:**
   - The LLM answer's markdown RACI is generally well-formatted but fails the "every step mapped from the source text to the mandated terminology without omissions or substitutions" requirement.

**Positive Aspects:**
- The LLM answer strictly adheres to the mandated terminology for the three roles ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst").
- The answer is presented in markdown as requested.

**Summary:**  
The answer shows understanding of the process and effort to apply the vocabulary. However, omitting Operations Manager, inconsistently mapping roles, over-segmenting tasks, and error-prone assignment of RACI letters demonstrate significant deviations from the mandated ground truth—hence, 5.0. With utmost strictness applied, especially given the criteria, a substantial mark down is necessary.
