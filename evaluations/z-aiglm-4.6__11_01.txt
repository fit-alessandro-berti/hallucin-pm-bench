The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h/120.0h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quotes the required metrics verbatim from the table (with minor but acceptable decimal precision), stays under 150 words (~120), uses a professional memo format, avoids any prohibited content (no service times, throughput, or extra activities), and provides concrete, logically relevant actions tied to waiting-time issues. Each action implies a â‰¥20% reduction (via general projection), making them data-driven in context without fabricating unsupported metrics.

Deductions (-1.0 total): Slight abbreviation ("95p" vs. full "95th-percentile"); actions are relevant but differ in specificity/wording from ground truth (e.g., no per-action % estimates or "pilot tests"/"estimated" claims, which add evidential flavor); minor extraneous closing phrase on "customer experience" (not core but adds fluff). Highly compliant overall under strict evaluation.
