5.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correct Overall Conclusion (+2.0 points)**: Both the LLM answer and ground truth correctly declare "Non-compliant" based on violations of Rules 2 and 3.
- **Accurate Identification of Key Violations (+2.0 points)**: The LLM correctly identifies and explains violations of Rule 2 (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods) and Rule 5 (compliant ending with Archive_Record), matching the ground truth.
- **Partial Accuracy on Rule 3 (+1.0 point)**: The LLM recognizes the Three_way_match timing violation after Goods_Received, but introduces a factual error by stating #10 is the "third activity after" #6 (it is the **fourth**: #7=1st, #8=2nd, #9=3rd, #10=4th). This miscalculation undermines the precision of the justification, even though the conclusion (exceeding ≤2 distance) is correct.
- **Handling of Rule 4 (0.5 points)**: The conclusion (satisfied, no direct CFO → Intern follow) matches the ground truth, but the explanation is convoluted, rambling, and includes irrelevant tangents (e.g., "that’s not the issue" about Expedite_Flag; unnecessary "Correction" block and human-role speculation). This lacks the clarity and conciseness of the ground truth.
- **Omission of Rule 1 (-2.0 points)**: The LLM entirely skips evaluating Rule 1, despite the prompt's emphasis on the PO amount exceeding €10,000 and the need for two specific approvals before Issue_PO. The ground truth explicitly verifies this as satisfied, making the omission a major gap in comprehensive rule coverage.
- **Structural and Formatting Issues (-1.0 point)**: The LLM's response lacks the ground truth's systematic, numbered evaluation of **all** rules (1-5). Instead, it uses inconsistent numbering (jumps to Rule 5 mid-explanation), includes redundant "Final justification," and has a disorganized flow, deviating from the prompt's required "numbered justification that cites the relevant rules."
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, small errors (e.g., activity counting) and omissions result in significant deductions. The response is functionally correct but sloppy and incomplete, warranting a mid-low score. No credit for minor alignments like timestamps in explanations, as they are superficial.
