**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically and factually identical to the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate/not accurate), structure (clear verdict + bulleted case-by-case evidence + summary refutation), and key points: reverse ordering in cases 1001/1003 (with accurate sequences implying no "Authorize_Refund immediately before Update_Inventory"), absence in 1002 disproving "always," explicit data sufficiency note aligning with system instructions. Stylistic variances (e.g., no line numbers, minor extra phrasing in 1002 sequence, "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate," no exact headers) are trivial and do not alter correctness, completeness, or brevity; no factual errors, guesses, or omissions under utmost strictness.
