10.0

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in conclusion ("No"), per-rule assessments (satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4; violation of Rule 3), and reasoning (NA precedes RA, violating the requirement for both reviews to complete first). Stylistic differences (bullets vs. table; step numbering vs. none) do not affect accuracy or completeness, with no factual errors or omissions.
