9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant and provides accurate, rule-by-rule reasoning that closely matches the ground truth. It clearly states the rule violation (Rule 3: NA occurs before RA is complete), matches the reasoning, and accurately reflects which rules are satisfied and which are not. 

However, slight markdown/formatting differences from the ground truth (e.g., the table is omitted, and the rule-by-rule assessment is given in list format rather than tabular) introduce a small deviation from the strictest formatting expectations for a "gold standard" answer. While the answer is highly accurate and clear, this minor difference merits a reduction from a perfect score. As requested, even small errors result in point loss.

Final score: 9.0
