### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities and metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities are correctly identified and ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h/120.0h, Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h, Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h). Numbers are quoted accurately from the table, with no deviations or additions of service times/throughput/other activities.
- **Structure and Format**: Strong adherence to memo style (header, subject, concise body <150 words). Ground truth is more bare-bones (list format without header), but LLM's addition enhances "executive memo" crispness without violating constraints. Minor deduction for including ".0" in 120.0h (ground truth omits it as "120 h"), a small formatting inconsistency under strict scrutiny.
- **Actions**: Relevant and concrete, each logically tied to waiting-time bottlenecks with ≥20% reduction claims (e.g., automation/escalations for #1, event-driven processing for #2, routing rules for #3). However, significant differences from ground truth: #1 and #2 are near-identical in intent (reminders/escalations, batch-to-same-day shift), but #3 diverges (LLM focuses on prioritizing idle cases vs. ground truth's pre-classification/bypass for simple cases). This alters the specific data-driven mechanism, warranting a notable deduction for non-exact alignment. No unsupported inventions beyond plausible "simulations" (mirroring ground truth's "pilot tests/estimated").
- **Overall Compliance**: No unwarranted content; stays focused and under word limit. High fidelity, but action variance and tiny metric formatting prevent a perfect score.
