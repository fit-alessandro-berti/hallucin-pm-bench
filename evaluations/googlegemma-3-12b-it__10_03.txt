The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth and prompt requirements. It violates the strict vocabulary policy by including the forbidden term "Preliminary Assessment" (a direct leak of a disallowed synonym), while redundantly duplicating it alongside "Intake Vetting." It also introduces unauthorized activities ("Scheduling the Payment," "Releasing the Funds," "Notifying the Originating Analyst"), breaching the "do not rename, merge, or add activities" ruleâ€”the ground truth strictly limits to four core activities plus two derived ones without extras. RACI assignments are inaccurate across the board (e.g., ground truth has Compliance Analyst as R,A for KYC Review and AML Screening with Officer as C, but LLM incorrectly assigns A to Officer and C to Front-Office; Risk Scoring mismatches with Officer as A in ground truth but I in LLM). The output includes an unnecessary introductory sentence, violating the "Return the matrix as a Markdown table" instruction. No credit for partial correct terms, as the overall structure, fidelity, and compliance are nullified by these pervasive errors.
