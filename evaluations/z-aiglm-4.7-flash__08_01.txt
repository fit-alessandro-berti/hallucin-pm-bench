**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correctness (high marks: 9.5/10)**: Core answer matches ("Yes", same sequence T1→T2→T5 showing T5 before T3). Markings trace accurately reflects enabling (p3≥1 ∧ p4=0). T5 firing correctly described as consuming p3→p6.
- **Sequence (good but deduct: 8.5/10)**: Provides valid minimal sequence up to T5 (sufficient for proof). However, lacks inline markings (unlike ground truth's compact `p1=1, p2=1` etc.); short list vague on T5 ("inhibitor condition" vs. precise "p3, inhibitor p4"). Note on "optionally fire T3 afterwards, but it must fire after T5 to satisfy the condition" is **factually flawed** (T3 firing is optional; "must" contradicts "optionally" and misstates question—no requirement for T3 to fire at all).
- **Justification (moderate deduct: 7.0/10)**: Brief & correct on enabling, but weaker/miss key insight (no mention T3 adds p4 token, permanently disabling T5 via inhibitor—ground truth's "must fire before T3 if ever"). Sloppy phrasing ("T5 more immediate"; irrelevant "distinct"). Verbose trace good but redundant vs. ground truth's tight bullet-proof explanation.
- **Structure/Clarity (deduct: 8.0/10)**: Readable, but fluff (e.g., "Normal execution"), less concise than ground truth's elegant inline sequence + proof.
- **Overall Differences**: Minor errors (note, phrasing) + missing depth = significant strict loss (~1.8 total deduct). No major factual break, but not ground truth match.
