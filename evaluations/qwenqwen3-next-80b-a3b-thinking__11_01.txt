### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Perfect match. The three activities are correctly identified and ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table, with no inclusion of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities. This aligns fully with the ground truth and prompt requirements.
- **Format and Conciseness**: Strong. The response is a crisp executive memo under 150 words (98 words), with appropriate structure (To/Subject lines, ranked list). The ground truth is more bare-bones (list-like without headers), but the prompt explicitly requests a "memo," so this enhances fidelity rather than detracting.
- **Actions**: Partial match, leading to a deduction. Each action is concrete, logically tied to reducing waiting time, and claims ≥20% impact, meeting the prompt's core criteria without inventing unsupported data (e.g., no fabricated pilots or metrics beyond the general promise). However, strict comparison to ground truth reveals differences: (1) Actions differ in specifics (e.g., LLM's 4-hour reminders vs. ground truth's 24-hour escalation with pilot data; LLM's auto-generation vs. e-signature replacement; LLM's AI pre-assessment vs. rules-engine classification). (2) Ground truth provides per-action data-driven backing (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%," "estimated 30%"), while LLM's is generalized at the end ("targets ≥20% using data-driven process optimization"), lacking equivalent specificity or evidence per item. These variances, though minor in validity, constitute noticeable differences under strict evaluation, warranting a 1.5-point deduction from a potential 10.
- **Overall Adherence**: No violations of prohibitions (e.g., no off-topic discussion). The response is professional and targeted, but action divergences prevent a perfect score.
