7.0

The LLM answer performs well regarding conciseness, ranking, and selection of activities. It maintains focus on waiting time and stays within the word limit.

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability) based strictly on average waiting time.
- Quotes both average and 95th-percentile waiting times for each.
- Suggested actions are reasonably relevant and target waiting time.

**Errors/Losses:**
- **Numerical presentation:** The answer presents "36.5h avg, 120h 95p" (etc.)—these are acceptably close to ground truth, but not "verbatim," as instructed ("avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h," etc.). The lack of spacing ("h" attached to numbers, comma and lack of clear units) is a minor formatting error, but per instructions all "small errors" incur loss of points.
- **Recommended actions:** Less concrete and justified than the ground truth. For example:
    - "Automate tracking with real-time reminders escalating every 4 hours" is not supported by pilot/test or data, and 4 hours is not consistent with the ground truth's 24 h escalation or justification.
    - "Instantly auto-generate closure letters" recommends e-generation but lacks mention of batch → same-day, nor e-signature, and no estimate of the expected reduction.
    - "Deploy AI pre-assessment" is vaguer than "rules-engine pre-classification" and lacks specificity about bypassing the adjuster queue or the percentage reduction targeted.
- **Missing action quantification:** Nowhere does the LLM specify expected or actual % reductions per action, only a blanket "Each action targets ≥20% wait time reduction." This is a significant omission according to instructions.
- **Memo structure:** The subject and word count are present but not requested; it's not an overt minus, but is superfluous.

**Summary:**  
While the LLM answer is accurate in activity ranking and numerics, the lack of format precision and action quantification per instruction, vagueness and unsubstantiated actions, and minor formatting deviations warrant a strict deduction to 7.0.
