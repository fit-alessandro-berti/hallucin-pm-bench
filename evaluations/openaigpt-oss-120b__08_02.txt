**Score: 9.5**

**Justification:**

The LLM answer is almost perfect:

- **Correctness:** The answer correctly analyzes the Petri net, provides the correct minimal firing sequence, and explains the logic behind T5 being able to fire before T3.
- **Clarity:** The explanation is clear, concise, and under the word limit.
- **Firing Sequence:** The sequence `[ T1 , T2 , T7 , T4 , T5 ]` exactly matches the ground truth logic.
- **Explanatory Detail:** The LLM states that T5 consumes the required tokens and occurs before T3, just as in the ground truth.

**Only Minor Issues:**

- The LLM answer does not explicitly mention the marking at each step, as seen in the ground truth answer. The markings (M₁, M₂, ...) are missing, which slightly reduces clarity and explicitness of the sequence, though the content is unambiguous.
- The final explanation could mention that firing T5 disables T3, as noted in the ground truth (i.e., after T5, T3 can no longer fire), though this is strongly implied.

**Conclusion:**  
Due to these minor omissions of stepwise markings and explicit disabling of T3, a small deduction is appropriate. Otherwise, the answer is complete and correct.

**Final score: 9.5**
