The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" for Q1 (matching ground truth) and provides the identical minimal firing sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5], demonstrating T5 firing before T3 via the alternative path to P5 while P2 remains marked. The explanation accurately traces markings implicitly and justifies minimality, staying under 120 words.

Minor deductions for: (1) Lack of explicit marking notations (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}), present in ground truth; (2) No mention of T3 disabling post-T5, which ground truth uses to confirm precedence; (3) Slightly different structuring (separate "Answer 1" without Q1's brief explanation integrated). No factual errors, but these omissions reduce perfect alignment under strict criteria.
