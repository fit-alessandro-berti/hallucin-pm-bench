8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly captures the core process structure, including the start event, seven tasks, three exclusive gateways (despite the prompt mentioning only "two decision points," which appears to be a minor inconsistency as the description implies three), the re-work loop from customer confirmation back to "Initial Diagnosis" (gw3 → t3), and the direct flow from "Provide Reset Instructions" to "Confirm with Customer." No unauthorized elements (e.g., timers, escalations, or extra activities) are invented, adhering to the "do not add" rule. The XML is concise (<40 lines), uses succinct IDs, and forms a valid <definitions> block without diagram elements.

However, under strict evaluation, several small but significant deviations from the ground truth and prompt reduce the score:
- **Task names**: "Classify Ticket (Automatic)" adds interpretive phrasing not in the description (line 2 only says "automatically classified"); ground truth's "Auto-Classification" is closer but still interpretive—LLM's extra words constitute a minor invention (-0.3).
- **Gateway names**:
  - gw2: "Agent can resolve?" infers an agent decision not explicitly named in line 5; ground truth's "Resolved Internally?" is similarly interpretive but less agent-specific (-0.1).
  - gw3: "Issue Resolved?" mismatches line 8's focus on customer confirmation; ground truth's "Customer Confirms?" is exact (-0.2).
- **Sequence flows**: Lacks <conditionExpression> elements for decisions (e.g., "yes"/"no" as formal expressions); instead uses informal name attributes ("Yes"/"No"). BPMN 2.0 XML expects conditions for exclusive gateways, making this incomplete (-0.4).
- **Structural/headers**: Missing <?xml> declaration and targetNamespace (present in ground truth); process ID "SupportTicketProcess" vs. ground's "support_ticket" (with name attribute); minor ID variations (e.g., "start1" vs. "start") deviate from ground truth's simplicity (-0.3).
- **Overall fidelity**: Flow logic is identical (e.g., specialist path merges correctly into "Resolve Issue" per line 6; loop exact per line 9), but the cumulative mismatches in precision and XML standards prevent a perfect score. No major hallucinations, but strictness demands deduction for inexact translation.

This is a strong but not flawless match—core BPMN semantics are preserved, warranting 8.5 over lower (e.g., 7.0 for name/condition errors alone).
