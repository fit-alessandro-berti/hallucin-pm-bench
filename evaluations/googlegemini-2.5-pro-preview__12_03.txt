The LLM answer correctly identifies that the FACT is inaccurate (answers "No") and cites the two relevant counterexamples (C002 and C004), specifying the sequences and indicating what intervenes before "Validate_Payment." This matches the main substance of the ground truth.

However, compared to the ultra-strict and complete structure of the ground truth answer:
- The LLM answer does not address **all cases explicitly** (i.e., does not affirm that C001 and C003 do follow the rule).
- It doesn’t mention that “two out of four” violate the rule, nor does it include an explicit tabular/case-by-case justification.
- It doesn't frame the justification as systematically as in the ground truth (e.g., no cross-comparison or summary of positive/negative cases).
- Slight language imprecision: it says "in these cases" (referring only to the two negative cases), rather than contrasting with cases where the rule does hold.

Given the directive to punish even small deviations, these omissions reflect a meaningful loss of points. Score: 8.0.
