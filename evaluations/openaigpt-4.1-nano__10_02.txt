4.0

The LLM answer earns a **4.0/10.0** due to several significant deficiencies relative to the ground truth, assessed with the requested strictness:

**Major Issues:**
1. **Missing Operations Manager:**  
   The LLM answer omits the “Operations Manager” role, which appears as a key “Accountable” party for nearly every task in the ground truth. This severely breaks the RACI integrity.
2. **Accountabilities Not Assigned:**  
   The “Accountable” (A) column is left blank throughout the LLM table. In a RACI, accountability must be clearly defined for each activity.
3. **Consulted and Informed Underused/Misapplied:**  
   - In many rows, “Consulted” and “Informed” are left blank, whereas the ground truth clearly specifies these.  
   - Informing the Regulatory Liaison of case filing is presented as a dedicated task instead of being included as an “Informed” party for “Archive Record”.
4. **Missing or Nonstandard Task Wording:**  
   - Task/activity names frequently deviate from the ground truth’s mandated wording (e.g., “Receive the customer’s transfer instruction and log it…” instead of “Receive Payment Instruction”).
   - “Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary” and “Approve high-risk transactions after KYC Review” collapse activities, which should be separated.
   - “Notify the Regulatory Liaison of case filing” introduces an unnecessary new row—the ground truth assigns “Informed” for archiving instead.

**Minor Issues:**
5. **Table Structure:**  
   The LLM answer combines task descriptions and uses inconsistent phrasing. The ground truth maintains precise, uniform language.
6. **Vocabulary:**  
   While major mandated synonyms (“Transaction Analyst”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “KYC Review”) are generally respected, the IT Support role from the source text should have only a support function, but the LLM sometimes treats it as a primary Responsible party.

**Summary:**  
- The absence of “Accountable” and omission of “Operations Manager” are severe RACI failings.  
- Task names are loosely paraphrased, sometimes merged, or nonstandard.  
- Consulted and Informed participants are neglected.

**Therefore, a 4.0 score reflects the answer’s poor mapping and omissions despite generally using the correct key vocabulary.**
