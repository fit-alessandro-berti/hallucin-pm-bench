### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the prompt's requirements and shows some fidelity to the source text but diverges significantly from the ground truth in structure, completeness, role assignments, and details, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key differences include:

- **Structure and Format (Major Deduction)**: The ground truth uses roles as columns with RACI letters populated in cells, plus a legend. The LLM uses a standard RACI column format (Responsible, Accountable, etc.) with roles in cells, which superficially matches the prompt's description but results in mostly empty cells (e.g., no Accountable for any task, sparse Consulted/Informed). This incompleteness fails to fully define responsibilities, contrasting the ground truth's full population. Added notes in the LLM are extraneous, unlike the ground truth's integrated legend.

- **Roles and Vocabulary (Partial Credit, but Significant Loss)**: Both use mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") correctly, and IT Support from the source. However, the LLM leaves RACI assignments incomplete (e.g., no Accountable role assigned anywhere, unlike the ground truth's consistent "A" to Operations Manager). The ground truth introduces an unmandated "Operations Manager" (not in source or prompt, violating "only the mandated terms"), but since grading against ground truth, the LLM's lack of equivalent assignments (e.g., no overarching accountable role) is a mismatch.

- **Task Coverage and Wording (Moderate Deduction)**: The LLM covers all source steps explicitly (8 rows, including separate "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify the Regulatory Liaison," which faithfully maps steps 5–6). The ground truth condenses to 6 rows, omits explicit SWIFT handling (merges into "Release Payment"?), simplifies wording (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" vs. LLM's "Receive the customer’s transfer instruction and log it in the system"), and alters "archive the case file" to "Archive Record." LLM's wording is more precise to the source but doesn't match ground truth's mandated-style phrasing (e.g., no bold "**KYC Review**" emphasis in a dedicated row). Small wording variances (e.g., "high-risk transactions after KYC Review" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions") count as errors per strictness.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction)**: Assignments differ entirely and are incomplete in the LLM. Examples:
  - "Screen the payment against the sanctions list": LLM has only R=Transaction Analyst (blanks elsewhere); ground truth has R=Transaction Analyst, A=Regulatory Liaison, I=Operations Manager, C=IT Support.
  - "Perform KYC Review": LLM has only R=Regulatory Liaison; ground truth has C=Transaction Analyst, R=Regulatory Liaison, A=Operations Manager, I=IT Support.
  - Notification (step 6): LLM correctly isolates and assigns R=IT Support, Informed=Regulatory Liaison, but blanks A/C; ground truth folds into "Archive Record" with I=Regulatory Liaison.
  No overlap in full assignments, indicating fundamental misinterpretation of RACI distribution.

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness**: While the LLM avoids omissions and sticks to source roles without inventing (unlike ground truth's extra role), the incomplete table, mismatched assignments, and format deviations create substantial differences. Small issues (e.g., no bolding, verbose tasks, extraneous notes) compound losses. Under utmost strictness, this earns minimal credit for vocabulary adherence and task coverage but fails comprehensive RACI definition.
