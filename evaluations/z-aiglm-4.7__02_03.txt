**9.5**

The LLM answer is semantically perfect: correct number of cases (3), correct preceding activity (Pack_Items), and correct unique activity (Cancel_Order). It follows the prompt's instruction for "concise, bullet-point answers only."

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for:
- Q1 omits "cases" phrasing and explicit list (C123, C456, C789) present in ground truth, despite question only asking for count.
- No A1/A2/A3 labels matching ground truth structure.
- Inconsistent bolding (only first item bolded).
- Missing escape backslash in "Pack_Items" (vs. "Pack\_Items").

Utmost strictness applied, but differences are formatting/verbosity only—no factual errors.
