### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks, aligning with policy. However, added activities like "Approval", "Scheduling the Payment", "Releasing Funds", and "Notifying Originating Analyst" introduce unauthorized phrasings not derived strictly from the narrative or policy, violating "do not rename, merge, or add activities."
- **Activity Coverage and Fidelity (major deductions)**: The prompt requires covering *every activity* described without adding, but the LLM expands to 8 rows, inventing "Scheduling the Payment" and "Notifying Originating Analyst" as separate activities (narrative implies these under broader "Treasury Ops" actions like "schedule the payment" and "releases the funds/notifies"). Ground truth consolidates to 6 precise activities, omitting unsubstantiated splits. This adds extraneous content, directly contravening instructions.
- **RACI Assignments (severe inaccuracies)**: Assignments deviate substantially from ground truth and narrative logic, with frequent errors:
  - Intake Vetting: LLM (R Front-Office, I Compliance Analyst, A Officer, blank Treasury) vs. GT (R,A Front-Office, C Compliance Analyst, – Officer, I Treasury). Wrong: Officer shouldn't be A; Treasury is I, not blank; Compliance is C, not I; Front-Office lacks A.
  - KYC Review & AML Screening: LLM (I Front-Office, R Compliance Analyst, A Officer, blank Treasury) vs. GT (– Front-Office, R,A Compliance Analyst, C Officer, I Treasury). Wrong: Front-Office uninvolved (not I); Officer is C, not A; Compliance Analyst lacks A; Treasury is I, not blank.
  - Risk Scoring: LLM (I Front-Office, R Compliance Analyst, A Officer, I Treasury) vs. GT (C Front-Office, R Compliance Analyst, A Officer, I Treasury). Minor but strict error: Front-Office is C, not I.
  - Added rows (Approval, etc.): Entirely non-matching; GT has "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" with precise roles (e.g., R,A Officer for approval; R,A Treasury for release). LLM's versions misassign (e.g., R Officer for Approval but ignores Treasury; splits release into two with wrong roles like A Officer instead of C).
- **Formatting and Presentation (deductions)**: Markdown table is used, but lacks ground truth's bolding (**R, A** for dual roles), uses blanks instead of – for no involvement, and includes an unnecessary header row spacing. No explanatory notes or key points, though not required.
- **Overall Strictness**: Even minor issues (e.g., I vs. C) warrant significant loss per instructions. Core structure attempts a RACI but fails on completeness, accuracy, and adherence, resulting in low fidelity (~30% alignment). No criminal/jailbreak issues, but evaluation is purely on prompt/ground truth match.
