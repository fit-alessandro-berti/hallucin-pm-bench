3.5

The LLM answer demonstrates an attempt to apply the instructed vocabulary and format a RACI matrix, but it falls well short of exact compliance per the ground truth. Here are the key deviations and errors, each penalizing the score:

**Vocabulary Policy Adherence:**
- The answer uses the correct mandated terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, and “Risk Scoring”) and does not include the forbidden synonyms. This is a strong point.

**Activity List:**
- The LLM answer introduces activities not in the ground truth: “Approval”, “Scheduling the Payment”, “Releasing Funds”, and “Notifying Originating Analyst.” The ground truth uses “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”, and explicitly states no activities should be renamed, merged, or added.
- The LLM combines or rewords activities like "Approval" and splits "Releasing Funds" and "Notifying Originating Analyst," which is explicitly forbidden.
- The answer omits “Compliance Officer Approval” as a distinct activity, which is present in the ground truth.

**RACI Assignments:**
- The matrix frequently shows only a single letter (e.g., only “R”, “A”, or “I”) per role, whereas the ground truth correctly indicates some roles should be “R, A”, etc.
- Assignments of responsibilities are frequently incorrect. For example, the Compliance Officer is incorrectly shown as “A” for nearly every activity except “Approval,” but should only be Accountable or Responsible for “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Risk Scoring.”
- Several roles are involved (“C” or “I”) incorrectly or are omitted where participation is required.

**Format:**
- Does not use a dash (–) for roles not involved, instead leaving cells blank.
- Omits strong/italic Markdown formatting as in the ground truth, though this is minor compared to process errors.

**Strictness Considerations:**
- The matrix significantly diverges from the activity names and structure specified, against direct instructions.
- Several process errors (e.g., incorrect, missing, or merged activities) would have major compliance implications.

**Conclusion:**
- Because of incorrect activity names, improper splitting/merging of activities, plus multiple RACI mis-assignments, a strict evaluation places this answer well below passing. However, due to correct vocabulary usage and attempted structure, it does not warrant a score at the lowest end (1.0–2.0).
- **Score: 3.5**—mainly for correct vocabulary and effort, but deducted heavily for process noncompliance and RACI misassignment.
