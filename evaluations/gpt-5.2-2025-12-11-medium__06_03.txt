The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the exact two concurrent task sets from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt and process description. It adheres strictly to the user instructions by focusing only on Process B, numbering the sets sequentially, and providing no extraneous information about other processes.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Formatting differences: Uses `{task, task}` set notation instead of ground truth's `` `task` ‖ `task` `` parallel symbol (-0.3); includes descriptive `(Parallel Split #1)` labels matching the process text but diverging from ground truth's **Set 1 – first parallel block:** phrasing (-0.3).
- Omits ground truth's explicit "No other tasks..." closing statement, though implicitly complete by listing all sets (-0.2).

Functionally identical and fully responsive to the prompt; differences are cosmetic and do not alter meaning or completeness.
