The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It clearly and accurately lists the two sets of concurrently executable tasks in Process B and numbers them in the order they appear. The specific tasks in each set are correct and match the ground truth answer.

However, there are a few minor issues:
- The LLM answer includes explanatory notes and some elaboration ("Located after Parallel Split #1", etc.), while the user prompt requested to "give no information about Processes A or C" and expects *only* numbered sets. The answer’s additional clarifications are not harmful, but they go slightly beyond the strict and minimal format of the ground truth.
- The format is close but not perfectly identical; the ground truth uses "– first parallel block" and "– second parallel block" and a minimal style, while the LLM uses explanatory notes in addition to numbering.

Strict adherence to brevity and style knocks off 1 point for non-minimalism. Content accuracy is perfect; format is very slightly over-elaborate.
