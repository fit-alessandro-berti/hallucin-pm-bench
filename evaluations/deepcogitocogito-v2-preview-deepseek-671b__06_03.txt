The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, matching the ground truth in content and order. However, it deviates significantly in format and brevity: it includes unrequested internal reasoning visible in the provided response, adds extraneous explanations (e.g., locations, merge details, sequential notes), uses curly braces {} instead of the ground truth's â€– symbol and backticks, and introduces a verbose introductory phrase not present in the ground truth. These additions violate the prompt's focus on a simple numbered list, resulting in substantial point deduction for lack of conciseness and fidelity to the expected minimalistic structure.
