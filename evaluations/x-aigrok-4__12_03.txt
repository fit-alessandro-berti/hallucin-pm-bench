The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise, case-by-case justification citing all relevant CaseIDs (C001, C002, C003, C004) and their sequences, highlighting the two counterexamples (C002 with "Pack_Items" intervening and C004 with "Check_Fraud" intervening) that disprove the "always" claim. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core content, including the sequences and violations. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's explicit tabular structure, quantitative summary ("two out of four"), and visual checks (✅/❌), which make the ground truth more organized but are not strictly required by the task. No factual errors.
