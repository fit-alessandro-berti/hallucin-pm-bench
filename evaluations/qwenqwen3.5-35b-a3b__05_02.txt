**5.0**

### Evaluation Reasoning:
- **Correct identification (partial credit)**: Both target the same `Task_CollectEquipment` `camunda:dueDate` attribute, complying with rules (modify existing attribute, no add/delete, single change).
- **Major deductions**:
  - Changed value differs (`P1D` vs. `P2D`): Significant error, as it alters the specific fix (strict matching required).
  - Diff format mismatches: LLM uses full unified diff with file headers (`--- a/process.xml`), line numbers (`@@ -19,7`), and extra context lines; ground truth uses minimal malformed hunk (`@@ -line +line @@`) without headers/numbers/context.
  - Rationale differs substantially: LLM mentions "aligns with rest of timeline" and "critical path bottleneck" without referencing "3-day SLA"; ground truth explicitly ties to "contractual 3-day SLA" and "without introducing new activities."
- **Minor positives**: Follows output structure (1./2.), single hunk, one-sentence rationale, valid XML change.
- **Strictness applied**: Differences in value/format/content = 50% loss; not identical = no perfect score.
