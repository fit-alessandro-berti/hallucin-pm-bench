The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifies the answer as "No" with precise counterexamples (C002 and C004) matching the log sequences, and fulfills the task requirements (Yes/No + justification citing relevant CaseIDs and sequences). It is concise yet complete for falsifying the "always" claim via counterexamples.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Lacking the comprehensive case-by-case analysis of all 4 cases (C001/C003 compliance shown in ground truth).
- No tabular format for structured presentation, reducing meticulousness slightly despite narrative clarity.

No factual errors; strict evaluation reflects only stylistic/completeness differences.
