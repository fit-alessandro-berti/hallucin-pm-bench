4.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (40% weight)**: Exact match ("1 time" vs. "1"). +4.0.
- **Part 2 (60% weight)**: Major deviations under strict criteria:
  - Misses core ground truth elements: sample specifics (14 events/3 cases/<2 hours), frequency swing (0%-7%), wide confidence interval, extreme sampling error for rare events, near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing strict/fuzzy matching distortion.
  - Logical flaw: Claims "overestimate frequency" then contradicts with "assume ... rare" (inconsistent; small sample with 1/3 cases ~33% could bias high, but ground truth emphasizes bidirectional volatility).
  - Superficial; no precise analytics. Word count OK (~80). +0.2.
- **Overall**: Significant content gaps and errors deduct heavily per "utmost strictness" and "small errors = significant loss."
