While the LLM answer correctly gives “No” and identifies C003 as a counter-example, it contains a significant factual error regarding C001: in this case, *Receive_Order* (line 1) actually occurs before *Validate_Payment* (line 2), not the other way around as claimed by the LLM. Furthermore, the answer fails to mention C005, which contains *Validate_Payment* (line 11) without any corresponding *Receive_Order*, as highlighted in the ground truth. These omissions and misreadings mean the answer is only partially accurate, evidencing two important mistakes: (1) a misinterpretation of C001, and (2) missing a crucial negative example (C005). Strict grading, per instructions, results in a significant deduction of points.
