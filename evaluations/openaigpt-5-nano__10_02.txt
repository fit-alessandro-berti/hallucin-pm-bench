3.0

**Justification:**

The LLM answer demonstrates an attempt to use the mandated vocabulary, but contains several significant errors, omissions, and deviations from the prompt and ground truth. 

**Major Issues:**
- **Roles:** The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" entirely from the RACI matrix, whereas the ground truth includes it as Accountable for every task.
- **Task Naming:** Tasks are inconsistently named and not standardized as in the ground truth answer. For example, “Transaction Analyst receives the transfer instruction and logs it in the system” is not as concise as “Receive Payment Instruction.”
- **Mandated Vocabulary:** While the LLM uses the mandated role terms, it fails to use the mandated activity wording (e.g., “KYC Review” as a task label).
- **Task Breakdown:** The step division does not align to the cleanly defined activities in the ground truth answer (e.g., “Archive Record” is split awkwardly with notification as a separate task).
- **RACI Assignment Errors:** Responsibilities and accountabilities differ from the ground truth (e.g., Transaction Analyst is Accountable for multiple tasks rather than Operation Manager; Regulatory Liaison is responsible/accountable for more steps than appropriate).
- **Consulted/Informed Assignments:** These are inconsistently or incorrectly allocated compared to the ground truth (e.g., “IT Support” and “Regulatory Liaison” both shown as “Consulted” and “Informed” in various tasks not matching the reference table).

**Minor Issues:**
- Multiple steps per row, such as “IT Support archives the case file; Regulatory Liaison is notified,” break the required atomic activity format.
- Some unneeded extra detail (like listing “Regulatory Liaison” as both Consulted and Informed on the same task).

**Conclusion:**  
A strict evaluation penalizes these errors heavily; the lack of Operations Manager, inconsistent task names, disalignment of RACI assignments, and less precise adoption of mandated language result in a low score—**3.0**.
