The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in nearly every aspect, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Table structure and orientation**: The LLM uses a row-per-task format with R/A/C/I as columns and roles populated in cells, while the ground truth uses roles as columns with R/A/C/I indicators (bolded) in cells under each role. This is a fundamental mismatch in RACI presentation.
- **Number and definition of tasks**: The LLM expands to 7 tasks (splitting step 5 into release and SWIFT sending, plus archive as 7), with verbose, descriptive wording directly from the source (e.g., "Transaction Analyst receives the transfer instruction and logs it in the system"). The ground truth has exactly 6 concise tasks, omits the SWIFT sending entirely (a critical process step), and rephrases (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" instead of including logging). The LLM's inclusion of an extra task and differing wording creates misalignment.
- **Roles used**: The LLM adheres strictly to source-derived roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), using only mandated terms without additions. The ground truth introduces an extraneous "Operations Manager" role (not present in the source or mandates), violating the prompt's intent to map directly without inventions.
- **RACI assignments**: No meaningful overlap; assignments are entirely inconsistent across all tasks. For example:
  - LLM task 1 (receive/log): R/A = Transaction Analyst; C = IT Support; I = Regulatory Liaison.
  - Ground truth "Receive Payment Instruction": R = Transaction Analyst; I = Regulatory Liaison; A = Operations Manager; C = IT Support.
  Similar mismatches occur everywhere (e.g., LLM task 3: R/A = Regulatory Liaison; ground truth "KYC Review": R = Regulatory Liaison but A = Operations Manager). Empties/dashes in LLM (e.g., for task 2 C/I) contrast with ground truth's full assignments.
- **Vocabulary and formatting details**: While both use mandated terms ("KYC Review", etc.) correctly, the LLM lacks the ground truth's bolding of **R**/**A** etc., "mandated wording" header emphasis, and separate Legend. The LLM's task 7 includes "Regulatory Liaison is notified" (accurately reflecting step 6), but ground truth's "Archive Record" omits explicit notification handling.
- **Completeness and fidelity to source**: The LLM covers all source steps without omissions (including SWIFT), but its expansions and differing RACI logic diverge. The ground truth omits a key task (SWIFT), adds unsupported elements, and reorganizes without justification.

These are not minor variations but wholesale differences in structure, content, and assignments, reflecting failure to match the ground truth's specific design. Even partial alignments (e.g., mandated vocabulary) cannot offset the extensive discrepancies under utmost strictness.
