6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies the same three activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) as the worst-performing based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth's selection. SLA exceedances are quantified accurately (+300s for Risk Review and Legal Approval; +60s for Credit Assessment), with data-grounded details on waiting times. Structure as a memo is appropriate, with bullet points used only for recommendations as instructed. No extraneous inventions like total cases (ground truth's "4 805" appears fabricated, as data shows declining cases per stage, not a sum), loan amounts, or unsubstantiated projections (ground truth's "35% reduction"). Word count is approximately 150, and content sticks closely to provided metrics without adding absent activities.
  
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: Phrasing and order differ (LLM starts with Risk Review; ground truth with Legal Approval), introducing minor inconsistencies in emphasis. Derived percentages (e.g., "100% over target," "80% waiting") are calculable from data but not directly provided, potentially violating "ground every sentence in the data; do NOT invent metrics" more than ground truth's raw reporting. "From" line mismatches ("Senior Process Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office"). Subject header differs substantially ("Critical Process Bottlenecks & Recommendations" vs. "Throughput Bottlenecks in Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)," with ground truth inventing "Loan-Origination" and a date). Most critically, all three recommendations are entirely different from the ground truth's (e.g., LLM's "redistribute workload" for Risk Review vs. ground truth's "add one risk analyst... automate external score"; similar mismatches for others), despite both being data-drivenâ€”this core element shows low fidelity. No closing projection or total cases mention in LLM avoids invention but misses ground truth's holistic summary, reducing completeness.

This score reflects high alignment on identification/quantification (~80% match) but major divergences in recommendations and formatting/phrasing (~50% match overall), penalized strictly per instructions.
