The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel), with no additions, omissions, or commentary deviating from the prompt. Content and structure fully match the ground truth. However, it lacks the bullet points ("-") used in the ground truth for list items across all sections and does not replicate the alignment spacing in the second gateway entry, which are minor formatting discrepancies warranting a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
