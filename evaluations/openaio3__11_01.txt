### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. The three worst activities by waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5/120 h; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2/44 h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8/16.4 h) are correctly identified, ranked, and quoted verbatim from the table. No other activities mentioned.
- **No unwarranted content**: Fully compliant—no service times, throughput discussions, or extraneous activities. However, minor deduction for referencing execution counts (e.g., "275 cases," "≈124 cases") in actions, which borders on discussing throughput (volume metrics), even if data-driven and tied to the table. Ground truth avoids this entirely.
- **Action relevance**: Strong overall—each action is concrete, logically targets waiting time, and claims ≥20% reduction with supporting rationale (e.g., "similar insurers 30%+," "internal pilots 80% faster," "modeling...25%"). But differences from ground truth (e.g., RPA batch vs. e-signature for #2; low-value rerouting vs. pre-classification for #3) introduce rephrasing/variations, not identical intent, warranting a strict deduction for non-exact alignment. Reminders for #1 are closest.
- **Format/conciseness**: Memo structure (header, subject, closing) fits "executive memo" prompt and stays ≤150 words (~140). Ground truth is more terse/bullet-like, but LLM's style is professional and on-topic. Minor loss for added flair (e.g., "lion’s share of idle time").
- **Strictness adjustment**: Core fulfillment is excellent (9+), but action divergences and borderline throughput refs deduct 1.5 points for imperfect fidelity to ground truth. No major errors, but small ones (per instructions) impact significantly.
