The LLM answer is factually correct, covers all cases accurately, disproves the claim properly (reversed order, absence, wrong order with intervention), and cites case IDs/activities as required. It matches the ground truth in substance, structure (verdict + bulleted evidence + conclusion), and brevity.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Stylistic differences: "not accurate" vs "inaccurate"; no exact "Short verdict"/"Justification (evidence-based)" headers (-0.3).
- No line citations (ground truth cites lines 3-4, 11 & 14) (-0.3).
- Case order altered (1001/1003/1002 vs 1001/1002/1003) and extra detail on "Quality_Check intervening"/"neither consecutive" (accurate but deviates from ground truth wording) (-0.2).
