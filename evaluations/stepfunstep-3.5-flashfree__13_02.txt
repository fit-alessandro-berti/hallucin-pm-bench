**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b are numerically identical (exact values, proper rounding to two decimals). Question 3 is ≤100 words (80 words), explicitly mentions the single occurrence (i, ii, iii criteria met: single occurrence stated; variance/instability via "outlier nature," "overfit," "incorrectly weight rare event"; caution against over-generalization via "risks treating as typical," "distorting performance metrics," "misguided decisions"). No errors, inventions, or deviations.
