7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correctness on core decision**: The LLM correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" (matching ground truth), and accurately pinpoints the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event citations and explanations. No factual errors in the analysis provided.
- **Justification quality**: The numbered justifications are clear, concise, and directly cite the relevant (violating) rules as required by the prompt. This aligns with the "relevant rules" aspect, focusing on what drives non-compliance.
- **Differences from ground truth (deductions)**: 
  - **Incompleteness (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM omits analysis of Rules 1, 4, and 5, which the ground truth explicitly verifies as satisfied. Under utmost strictness, this is a significant gap, as a full audit should confirm no additional violations exist, potentially missing subtle issues.
  - **Depth and structure (minor deduction: -0.5 points)**: Lacks the comprehensive rule-by-rule enumeration, summary conclusion, and bolding/formatting of the ground truth, making it less thorough and audit-like.
- **Overall strictness**: With zero errors in stated content but notable incompleteness, the score reflects strong partial alignment (80% effective) rather than perfection. A 10.0 would require exact matching in scope and detail.
