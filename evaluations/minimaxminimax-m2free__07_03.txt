The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, with correct identification and formatting of all added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway changes under the required headings. The sole discrepancy is minor formatting: in GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES, the ground truth uses extra spaces after the colon in "- Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" (likely for alignment), while the LLM uses a single space ("- Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel"), deviating slightly from the exact string match. Under utmost strictness, this small formatting error warrants a deduction, but the functional accuracy remains perfect.
