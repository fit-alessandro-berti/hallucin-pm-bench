The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) as the ground truth, with a valid explanation under 120 words that captures the key mechanism (using the P1-path for P5 while preserving P2 for T5 before T3). Minor deductions for lacking detailed markings (M0 to M5), numbered sequence structure, and the confirmatory note on T3 disabling (T5 consumes P2), which add precision in the ground truth. These format and detail omissions reduce completeness without factual errors.
