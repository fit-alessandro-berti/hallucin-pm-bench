**Score: 9.0**

**Justification:**

- The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" to Q1 and provides the correct minimal firing sequence for Q2: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. This matches the ground truth.
- The core reasoning is valid: the answer clearly explains that the token in P2 remains unused while generating a token in P5 via the alternative path, and thus T5 is enabled before T3 fires.
- However, there are small omissions and minor issues:
    - The explanation does not explicitly mention that after T5 fires, T3 is disabled because P2 is now empty, which is a key point in the ground truth answer.
    - The LLM uses the phrase "without touching P2"—while understandable, it is slightly informal for a process-mining analyst and could be clearer.
    - Minor phrasing like "T5 can now synchronise on {P2,P5} and fire before T3 (which would consume P2)” could be slightly more precise (e.g., “T3 is not enabled because P2 is not consumed until T5”).
- The sequence does not show markings per step, which the ground truth includes.

**Summary**: The answer suffices in accuracy and reasoning, but lacks some precision in technical detail and marking progression, justifying a 1-point deduction for strict grading.
