The LLM answer accurately identifies that the statement is false, names the three relevant cases, and provides supporting evidence for each. It correctly notes that Authorize_Refund does not always immediately precede Update_Inventory, and highlights that the actual order (in cases 1001 and 1003) is reversed, while in case 1002 Update_Inventory does not appear at all. 

However, there are two issues that warrant a points deduction:

1. The LLM introduces a small inaccuracy in wording: for Case 1003, it states, "Update_Inventory occurs before Authorize_Refund, with Quality_Check in between," which is correct. But it lists the activities as “Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund …” omitting the actual full sequence, and does not explicitly clarify that Authorize_Refund NEVER comes immediately before Update_Inventory.

2. The verdict is correct but the explanation lacks clear, direct articulation that in NONE of the cases does Authorize_Refund ever immediately precede Update_Inventory. The ground truth answer is more explicit on this point.

Therefore, while the LLM response is largely correct and complete, these minor clarity and explicitness issues justify a deduction of two points.
