9.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the user's query by providing a clear "No" verdict and evidence-based counterexamples for all three cases, mirroring the ground truth's structure and content (reversed ordering in cases 1001 and 1003; absence in 1002). It correctly negates the claim without speculation, cites case IDs and activities/sequences, and notes intervening steps where relevant (e.g., Quality_Check in 1003).

**Minor deductions (-0.5 points) for strictness:**
- Lacks the ground truth's explicit "Short verdict" framing and bullet-point structure for slightly less formal organization.
- Omits line references (e.g., "lines 3-4"), though the data presentation implies them and this is not a factual error.
- Conclusion phrasing ("does not always occur") is precise but less emphatic than the ground truth's "the statement is false," though functionally equivalent.

No factual errors, omissions, or deviations from the data; it's evidence-strict and responsive.
