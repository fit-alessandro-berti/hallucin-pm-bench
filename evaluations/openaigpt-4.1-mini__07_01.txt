6.5

• Added tasks  
The LLM correctly identifies the two added tasks ("check_vip" and "generate_qr") but omits their names and the explicit ids as shown in the ground truth, which is a notable loss of detail (e.g., should write "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)").

• Removed tasks  
The LLM lists only "send_rma_label" (id), missing the name as specified in the ground truth ("Send RMA Label (id = `send_rma_label`)"). This omission reduces clarity and precision.

• Gateway type changes  
Correctly identifies the gateway id and the change in type and direction, although in the ground truth it's written more explicitly/formally (using backticks and bold for types).

Other issues:
- The answer uses bullet points instead of the required headings (e.g., **Added tasks**), impacting adherence to instructions.
- The LLM omits some requested formatting detail (element names exactly as they appear in the XML, use of code/backticks, and explicit task names).
- The grouping is acceptable, but presentation does not strictly adhere to the requested format.

These details, while seemingly minor, represent significant errors given the instruction to be extremely strict; hence a 3.5 point loss.
