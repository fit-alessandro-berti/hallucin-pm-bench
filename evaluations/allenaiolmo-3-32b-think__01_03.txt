**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Part (a)**: Near-perfect match (9.5/10). Identifies both decision points correctly with accurate rules in one sentence each. Minor phrasing differences ("skip manual underwriting" vs. "bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review"; "Approve the loan" vs. "loan may advance") are semantically equivalent but deduct slightly under utmost strictness.
- **Part (b)**: Major failures (2/10). Lists only 5/9 ground truth documents, omitting **Scorecard–Cyan/Magenta/Yellow** (first-appear in Step 3, treated as required documents by GT) and **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (explicitly listed in Step 8, separate from unsigned Offer Sheet 77). Order is correct for listed items but incomplete sequence distorts process flow. Defensive note on scorecards directly contradicts GT by excluding them, indicating misinterpretation.
- **Overall**: Weighted average ~4.0 reflects ~45% content match, with significant omissions of core elements (4/9 documents missed). Structure/formatting is strong but cannot compensate for factual differences under strict criteria. No hallucinations of non-existent items (e.g., KYC), but incompleteness is penalized heavily.
