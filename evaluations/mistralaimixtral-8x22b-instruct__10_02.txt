**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Roles**: Major mismatch. LLM omits "Operations Manager" (present in GT as key accountable role across tasks). Uses only 3 roles vs. GT's 4. Violates full coverage alignment (-2.0).
- **Tasks**: Incomplete fidelity. LLM lists 8 tasks with rephrased/additive titles (e.g., "Receives and logs customer transfer instruction" vs. GT "Receive Payment Instruction"; extras like "Ensures SWIFT message is sent" and "Notifies Regulatory Liaison" split source steps 5-6 unnaturally). GT has exactly 6 concise, mandated-phrased tasks. Omissions/substitutions in wording (no bold "**KYC Review**"; "Archives case file" vs. "Archive Record") (-2.0).
- **RACI Assignments**: Fundamentally divergent and invalid in places. E.g.:
  | Task (approx.) | LLM | GT | Match? |
  |----------------|-----|----|--------|
  | Receive | R(TA) | R(TA), I(RL), A(OM), C(IT) | Partial (-0.5) |
  | Screen | R(TA) | R(TA), A(RL), I(OM), C(IT) | Partial (-0.5) |
  | KYC Review | R(RL) | C(TA), R(RL), A(OM), I(IT) | Partial (-0.5) |
  | Approve | A(RL) | C(TA), R(RL), A(OM), I(IT) | Wrong (A vs. R for RL; no C/R) (-1.0) |
  | Release | R(TA) | R(TA), I(RL), A(OM), C(IT) | Partial (-0.5) |
  | Archive | R(IT) | C(TA), I(RL), A(OM), R(IT) | Partial (-0.5) |
  LLM extras invalid; many rows lack A/R (e.g., Approve no R; Receive no A) – breaks RACI rules (-1.0).
- **Structure/Format**: Markdown table OK, but header lacks GT's "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"; no bolded entries; extra "Key" and "Notes" absent in GT (-0.5). Legend phrasing differs.
- **Vocabulary**: Correct use of mandated terms (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst) (+1.0 partial credit).
- **Overall**: Covers source steps but distorts into non-GT form. Strictness deducts heavily for cumulative mismatches (no perfect row alignment).

Total reflects ~20% alignment; significant errors compound to low score.
