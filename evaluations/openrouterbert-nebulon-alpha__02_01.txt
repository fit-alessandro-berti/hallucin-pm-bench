8.0

**Evaluation Rationale** (strict assessment):  
Q1-Q4 are **identical** to ground truth (perfect).  
Q5 has a **significant error**: includes `"Quality_Check"` (which *does* appear as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an incorrect list of 4 items instead of 3. The other 3 items match, but this factual mistake (failing to identify C-77's first event) warrants a substantial deduction under utmost strictness (~2-point loss from 10.0). JSON format, structure, and types are correct. Overall: high accuracy with one clear content error.
