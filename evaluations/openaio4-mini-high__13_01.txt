9.5

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth across all questions, with no hallucinations or unjustified inferences. It adheres strictly to the provided log data.

- Q1: Matches exactly (1 occurrence), though phrasing adds minor unnecessary words ("Exactly" and quotes); deduct 0.2 for verbosity under strictness.
- Q2: Precise match on percentage and calculation (1/18 â‰ˆ 5.56%); equivalent to ground truth's explicit formula.
- Q3: Substantively identical, identifying A1002 correctly; minor phrasing difference ("The only case" vs. "Only case") deducts 0.1.
- Q4: Provides two clear, valid sampling-related reasons that directly map to ground truth options (temporal bias via "limited time window"; small sample size via "small and non-random sample" with apt elaboration). No deductions here, as additions like "non-random" enhance without deviating.
