The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A, emphasizing the absence of timestamps and rows needed for cycle time calculations, and maintaining a concise, single-paragraph explanation without guessing or using external knowledge. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (e.g., explicitly referencing Artefact B's irrelevance, which the ground truth omits as unnecessary) and a less direct opening phrasing compared to the ground truth's "Impossible â€”", but these are small and do not introduce errors.
