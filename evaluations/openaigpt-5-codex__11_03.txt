6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as the worst-performing based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth precisely. Quantification of SLA excesses (+300s for Legal and Risk, +60s for Credit) and waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s) is identical and accurate to the table data. Both use a memo format with "To: COO" (or equivalent), a subject line, and bullet points exclusively for recommendations. Core content grounds in provided metrics without extraneous inventions like total cases or dates.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for differences)**: 
  - Factual inaccuracy: LLM claims these are "the only SLA breaches," ignoring Verify Identity's breach (+30s), which the ground truth avoids by not making such a claim—strict penalty for this error (-1.0).
  - Structure and style mismatches: LLM uses flowing paragraphs for analysis, while ground truth uses bolded, concise listings for activities and includes a "From:" line, intro summary, and closing projection (absent in LLM)—not exact format (-0.5).
  - Recommendations: Completely different actions (e.g., LLM's cross-training and triage vs. ground truth's pre-checks, added analyst, and heuristics), with neither fully data-driven per prompt, but divergence from ground truth is a major content gap (-2.0).
- Overall: Strong on identification and quantification (70% weight), but deductions for errors, structure, and mismatched recommendations yield 6.5 under strict criteria. Small issues like invented phrases ("cascading constraint") compound minor losses.
