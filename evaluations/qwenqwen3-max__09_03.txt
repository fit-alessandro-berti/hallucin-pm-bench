The LLM answer is largely correct and covers nearly everything requested: it explains that calculation is impossible due to redacted data, specifically because timestamps (required for cycle time calculation) are missing, and clearly states that statistical calculation is not possible. It properly ignores Artefact B's KPIs as insufficient for computation.

However, it very briefly notes "no statistical calculation is possible" rather than specifying "neither the average cycle time nor its dispersion or confidence interval can be calculated," and does not explicitly mention that additional raw log entries would be required. The answer also does not use the word "impossible" as in the ground truth, which signals complete infeasibility rather than lack of possibility.

Given the extremely strict grading criteria, these small omissions (especially not specifying dispersion/CI language or the requirement for more event log entries) result in a 1-point deduction.
