3.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately pinpoints the primary violation (Rule 3, with NA occurring before RA), which aligns with the ground truth. However, it contains significant errors in per-rule assessments:
- **Rule 1**: Incorrectly labeled "VIOLATED" despite explaining it is satisfied (QE precedes RA once each); this contradicts the ground truth's clear "✔ Satisfied."
- **Rule 2**: Incorrectly labeled "VIOLATED" despite stating it is "satisfied" (VP after both QE and RA); contradicts ground truth's "✔ Satisfied."
- **Rule 4**: Incorrectly labeled "VIOLATED" (due to "preceding violations"), but it is actually satisfied (CC after NA and VP); contradicts ground truth's "✔ Satisfied."
These mislabelings introduce confusion and inaccuracy, deviating substantially from the ground truth's precise, table-based structure with unambiguous ✔/❌ indicators. The justification is verbose and inconsistent, lacking the clarity and completeness of the ground truth. Under strict evaluation, these errors (affecting 3/4 rules) warrant major point deduction despite the correct overall verdict and Rule 3 analysis.
