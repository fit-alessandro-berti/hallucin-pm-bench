**9.2**

### Strict Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Identification of three worst activities (perfect match, 3/3 points):** Both select **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, **Initial_Assessment** – aligned with dominant issues (waits: 150/30/18 min; rework/SLA highs).
- **Explanations (strong but minor deductions, 2.7/3):** 
  - Request_Documents: Accurate on 150 min wait (highest) & 22% rework (highest), but "five-times next highest" is imprecise (22/5.3 ≈4.15x, not 5x; -0.2).
  - Review_Documents: Spot-on 25 min proc (longest), stdev 9 (highest), 12.4% SLA (highest); correctly infers inconsistency.
  - Initial_Assessment: Valid metrics (18/12 min, 1.8%/3.2%), admits "not extreme...cumulative" (good per "say so if unclear"), but "moderate drag on throughput" misleading (its 270/day is high, drop is downstream; -0.1). Ground truth better ties to "upstream congestion."
- **Recommendations (excellent, data-driven & concrete, 2.9/3):** All quantifiable/tied to metrics (e.g., LLM's targets <5%, ≤30 min precise); differ from ground truth but equally valid (no hallucination).
- **Overall memo (concise ≤200 words, executive tone, table-strict: 9.3/10):** No absent activities; data-only; minor phrasing liberties (e.g., "defect rate" for rework) but no guessing. Lacks ground truth's end-to-end projections, but not required. Total deductions for 2 small factual stretches (-0.8 overall).
