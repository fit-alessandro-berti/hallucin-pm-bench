1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth and BPMN 2.0 standards in structure, elements, and fidelity to the prompt. Key failures include: non-standard JSON format (custom "Events" array, "ProcessFlow" with ad-hoc "_children" for branches/paralles instead of explicit BPMN types like "exclusiveGateway" or "parallelGateway" and "flows" array); invention of elements absent from the description (e.g., "AssignAgent", "ParseEmail" as separate, "DraftResolution", "HandleSimpleTickets", "CompleteRCA"); incorrect BPMN modeling (e.g., "ProvideResolution" as "EndEvent"; "InitialClassification" and "PerformRootCauseAnalysis" as invalid "ProcessDecision" classes rather than task + exclusiveGateway; linear sequencing of wait/reply/close with misplaced parallel for reminder/terminate, ignoring event-based gateway for timer vs. reply); improper parallel handling (e.g., simple/complex branches as children, not conditional flows; log/send parallel after invented "DraftResolution" but before wait, without proper join); failure to integrate cancellation as an interrupting event (tacked-on "Terminate" without attachments); addition of descriptions in JSON violating "no prose" rule; and overall hallucination of escalation-like decisions absent from the text. These errors render it non-functional as BPMN and unfaithful, warranting minimal score under strict criteria.
