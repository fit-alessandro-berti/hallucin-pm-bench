The LLM answer correctly answers **yes** with a valid, minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 fires before T3 (T3 not yet fired), precise markings, and solid brief justification matching the prompt's requirements. It accurately explains enabling conditions, inhibitor arc, and post-T3 disablement without errors.

Minor deductions (-0.3 total) for:
- Not explicitly stating the "must fire before T3 if ever" insight (extra depth in ground truth, though not required).
- Shorter sequence (stops at T5; ground truth extends to T3 post-T5 for explicit ordering, despite ground truth's own error in invalid T4 firing when p3=0).
- Verbose structure with extra sections vs. ground truth's conciseness.

No factual errors, fully addresses prompt strictly.
