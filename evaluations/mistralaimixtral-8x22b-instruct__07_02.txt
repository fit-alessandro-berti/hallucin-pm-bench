**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Core content accuracy (high marks base: 9.5/10)**: Correctly identifies all 3 added tasks, 1 removed task, and the exact gateway type change (exclusive → inclusive). No missed or hallucinated changes.
- **Strict deductions (significant loss for differences)**:
  - **Format/style mismatches (-0.5)**: Reversed id/name order (id first vs. name-first in ground truth); uses quotes/backticks swapped and no bolding on names; numbered lists under ### vs. markdown * **bullets**; no "## Expected Answer Key" or closing note "(No other...)".
  - **Extra/irrelevant content (-0.5)**: Unrequested intro sentence; in gateway section, includes ignored "updated name" (violates "ignore cosmetic renamings") and "additional outgoing flows" (not a "gateway-type change," pollutes the strict heading).
  - **Terminology/precision (-0.3)**: "Exclusive Gateway"/"Inclusive Gateway" (full/capitalized) vs. "**exclusive** (XOR)"/"**inclusive** (OR)"; no "*v1* to *v2*" or escaped "Gateway\_Decision".
  - **Structure (-0.2)**: Extra "**BPMN_v1** and **BPMN_v2**" bolding; no exact markdown fidelity.
- Overall: Excellent substance but stylistic/precision deviations and rule violations (ignoring renamings) prevent 10.0 under utmost strictness.
