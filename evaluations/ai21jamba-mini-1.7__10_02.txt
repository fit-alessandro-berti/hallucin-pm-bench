3.5

The LLM answer exhibits several substantial issues with respect to strict adherence to the prompt and the ground truth:

**Positive aspects:**
- The LLM generally tries to follow the mandated vocabulary (“KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”).
- The answer is well-formatted in Markdown table style.

**Severe errors and points of noncompliance:**

1. **Roles/Columns Mismatch:**  
   - The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role, which is present in the ground truth. Instead, it uses "KYC Review" as a column heading, treating it as both an activity and a role in the RACI, which is incorrect. "KYC Review" should be an activity/task, not an assignee or role.
   - It sometimes puts roles like "Compliance Officer" and "KYC Review" as *columns*, violating the enforced vocabulary and structure.

2. **Vocabulary Violations & Unauthorized Terms:**  
   - The LLM lists "Compliance Officer" and "KYC Review" as roles/accountabilities in several cells, whereas "Compliance Officer" is not allowed.
   - The enforced synonyms must *not* be deviated.

3. **Confusion between Activities and Roles:**  
   - The ground truth correctly maps *tasks* to *roles* using only the mandated terms as roles. The LLM answer mixes up this mapping, confusing activities (e.g., "KYC Review") with roles and vice versa.

4. **Omissions and Additions:**  
   - The LLM introduces steps and accountabilities not present (or extra roles not requested), such as repeatedly mentioning "KYC Review" as if it is a person/role.
   - It sometimes lists IT Support as "Accountable" or "Consulted" in places not reflected in the ground truth.

5. **Errors in RACI Assignments:**  
   - Several "Responsible" and "Accountable" designations are assigned to activities ("KYC Review") instead of the correct mandated role ("Regulatory Liaison").
   - In some steps, the accountable and responsible parties do not match the ground truth mapping (e.g., high-risk approvals).

6. **Formatting:**  
   - Activities are listed as the first column, but the rest of the columns mix up roles and activities, causing confusion against the ground truth.

7. **Legend Missing:**  
   - The LLM does not supply a legend in the table, though this is more minor compared to the above errors.

**Small errors also lead to a significant loss of points** – multiple major errors make this far from acceptable.

**Conclusion:**  
Due to incorrect use of roles and activities, violation of mandated vocabulary, and inaccurate RACI mappings, the answer is a poor reflection of the requirements and loses most of its possible points. The only redeeming quality is partial appropriate use of the mandated terminology for some cells, justifying a score slightly above the absolute minimum.

**Score justified: 3.5**
