### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Mandate Violations (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The prompt strictly mandates using "Regulatory Liaison" instead of "Compliance Officer" and never using "Compliance Officer." The LLM answer repeatedly uses "Compliance Officer" (e.g., in "Approve high-risk transactions," "Send SWIFT message," "Archive case file," "Notify Compliance Officer"). It also misapplies "KYC Review" as a role (e.g., listed in Accountable columns), treating an activity as a role, which contradicts the mandate to use these terms "for activities and roles" correctly. Ground truth adheres strictly, using only mandated terms without substitutions or errors.
  
- **RACI Structure and Format Errors (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: Standard RACI tables (as in ground truth) have tasks/activities as rows, roles as columns, and R/A/C/I letters in cells. The LLM uses a non-standard format with activities as rows and full role names in separate R/A/C/I columns, making it unclear and non-functional as a true RACI matrix. No legend is provided (ground truth includes one). Markdown is used, but the table is malformed and harder to read.

- **Content Completeness and Fidelity to Source (Moderate Deduction: -1.0 points)**: The LLM covers most source steps but adds unsubstantiated activities like "Notify Compliance Officer on file archival" (expands on source's vague "notified" without mandated mapping) and "Send SWIFT message" (ground truth omits explicit SWIFT/send, combining it implicitly under "Release"). Task phrasings diverge (e.g., LLM's "Log payment instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM's "Perform KYC Review for sender and beneficiary" is wordy vs. ground truth's concise "**KYC Review**"). Ground truth maps every step more precisely without additions/omissions, though it too slightly consolidates (e.g., no explicit notify or SWIFT).

- **Roles and Assignments (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Introduces inconsistent/inaccurate assignments (e.g., IT Support as Informed in unrelated spots; KYC Review as Accountable). Ground truth uses a consistent role set (including "Operations Manager" for accountability, inferred but not violated). LLM partially uses mandated roles like "Transaction Analyst" and "Regulatory Liaison" correctly but undermines this with errors.

Overall, while the LLM attempts a table and uses some mandated terms, the violations, structural flaws, and deviations from ground truth's precise, strict adherence warrant a low score under utmost strictness. Small errors (e.g., extra phrasing, missing legend) compound to significant loss, but partial coverage prevents a 1.0.
