### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment) in the same order, with throughput drops, high waits, processing times, rework, stdev/variability, and SLA breaches all strictly table-sourced. Memo format is executive-appropriate (TO/FROM/RE header), concise (~140 words <200), data-driven recommendations (e.g., throughput gap of 10 cases justifies staffing; high rework/wait justifies automation; high stdev/SLA justifies AI). No hallucinations, no extraneous activities, no guessing on ambiguous rankings.
- **Differences/Deductions (-0.8 total)**: 
  - Explanations slightly less comprehensive: Omits Review_Documents' 30-min wait (cited in ground truth); omits Initial_Assessment's 12-min processing/rework 1.8% (ground truth highlights). Relies more on throughput inferences (valid but interpretive).
  - Recommendations differ in specifics (e.g., staffing vs. triage for Initial_Assessment; portal vs. digital requests for Request_Documents) despite shared data rationale—concrete but not identical.
  - Minor stylistic gaps: No numbered list or bolded metrics (ground truth emphasizes **150 min** etc.); lacks concluding projection (ground truth adds speculative impact, unrequired but present).
  
Strict scoring reflects phrasing/metric selection variances as "small errors" per instructions, but core task fulfillment is near-perfect.
