**9.8**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in verdict (inaccurate/false), coverage of all three cases, key observations (reversed order in 1001/1003, absence in 1002, no occurrence of claimed sequence anywhere), and strict adherence to data without guessing. Justification cites exact case IDs and activities as required, concisely notes the "Quality_Check" detail (accurate and relevant), and explicitly counters "always" via "never occurs."

Minor deductions (-0.2) for stylistic differences only: lacks ground truth's explicit "Short verdict" header, bullet structure, bolding, and line citations (e.g., "lines 3-4"). These are presentational, not substantive errors, but under utmost strictness for "differences," they warrant a tiny loss despite perfect factual alignment and brevity matching the "short justification" request.
