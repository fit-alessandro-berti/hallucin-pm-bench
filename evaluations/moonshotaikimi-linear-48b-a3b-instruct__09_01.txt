1.0

The LLM answer fabricates non-existent elapsed times (e.g., 0.2 hours, 0.4 hours) not present in the redacted log, leading to invalid calculations (initially claiming 2.0 hours, then self-correcting to 0.30 hours). This violates the core instruction to only provide supported values and directly contradicts the ground truth by attempting computations despite the explicit absence of temporal data, resulting in zero alignment with the required conclusion that no cycle time can be computed.
