The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time of “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the data provided, clearly stating the lack of timestamps or duration information. It also notes explicitly that the historical benchmark is not applicable, as it comes from a different segment, mirroring the strict, data-based reasoning found in the ground truth answer.

There are no extraneous statements or unsupported assumptions in the LLM answer. The brief explanation also appropriately describes why calculation is not possible. There are no errors or omissions, even at the strictest level.
