### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt by using the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") correctly and covering all tasks from the informal description in Markdown format, including an extra granular split for the SWIFT message (which the ground truth omits). However, under utmost strictness, significant differences from the ground truth result in a low score:

- **Structural differences (major deduction: -3 points)**: The LLM uses traditional RACI columns (Task, Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), while the ground truth uses roles as columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support) with R/A/C/I letters in cells. This reverses the standard presentation implied by the prompt's explicit labeling of R/A/C/I categories. The LLM also uses "â€”" for empty cells, unlike the ground truth's approach of populating or leaving implicit. No legend is included in the LLM answer, unlike the ground truth.

- **Task coverage and wording differences (moderate deduction: -1.5 points)**: The LLM splits step 5 into two tasks ("Release payment after approval" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent"), adding detail not matched in the ground truth (which combines into "Release Payment" without SWIFT). Wording varies slightly (e.g., "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"; "Approve high-risk transaction" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions"). The ground truth boldly emphasizes "**KYC Review**" in the task, which the LLM does not.

- **Role assignments (R/A/C/I) differences (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely (present as Accountable in nearly every ground truth row, suggesting oversight or accountability). Assignments mismatch in nearly every row for shared tasks:
  - Receive: LLM assigns Accountable to Transaction Analyst (no Operations Manager Accountable or IT Support Consulted).
  - Screen: LLM has Regulatory Liaison Consulted and Transaction Analyst Accountable; ground truth reverses (Regulatory Liaison Accountable, Operations Manager Informed, IT Support Consulted).
  - KYC Review/Approve: Partial overlap (Regulatory Liaison Responsible, Transaction Analyst Consulted), but LLM assigns Accountable to Regulatory Liaison (vs. Operations Manager) and omits IT Support Informed.
  - Release: LLM has Regulatory Liaison Consulted and Transaction Analyst Accountable; ground truth has Regulatory Liaison Informed, Operations Manager Accountable, IT Support Consulted.
  - Archive: LLM has IT Support Responsible/Accountable; ground truth has IT Support Responsible, Operations Manager Accountable, Transaction Analyst Consulted.
  - Extra SWIFT task in LLM has no ground truth equivalent, with questionable self-Consulted (IT Support) and Accountable mismatch (Transaction Analyst).

These deviations indicate incomplete fidelity to the ground truth's interpretive mapping, despite both drawing from the source text. Total differences are substantial, justifying a score below 5.0 despite correct vocabulary use.
