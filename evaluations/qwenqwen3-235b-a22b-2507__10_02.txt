5.0

**Evaluation (with utmost strictness):**

### Positives
- The LLM answer uses only the mandated vocabulary for roles and activities where those terms are specified, e.g., "Transaction Analyst," "Regulatory Liaison," and "KYC Review."
- The RACI format is adhered to with clear columns.
- All steps from the process are represented in some form.

### Issues and Point Deductions

**1. Missing Role:**
- The "Operations Manager" role is completely omitted. The ground truth includes this role as being accountable (A) for every step. Failing to include an accountable role for many activities is a major error. **(Significant -2.5 pts loss)**

**2. RACI Assignments (Mapping & Accuracy):**
- Several RACI assignments in the LLM answer deviate materially from ground truth:
  - For "Receive and log customer transfer instruction," "Transaction Analyst" is both R & A, but ground truth has "Operations Manager" as A and Regulatory Liaison as I.
  - For "Screen payment against sanctions list," ground truth has "Regulatory Liaison" as A (LLM gives this to TA), and "Operations Manager" as I, which is missing.
  - "KYC Review" is mapped correctly in name, but the RACI fields (Responsible, Accountable, etc.) are different — ground truth has Regulatory Liaison as R, Operations Manager as A, LLM has RL as both R & A.
  - Several tasks list no one as Consulted or Informed where the ground truth includes such notifications. **(Major -1 pt loss)**

**3. Activity Naming:**
- Some activities do not strictly match mandated vocabulary, for instance:
  - "Receive and log customer transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction."
  - "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record"
  These differences are minor but do represent slippage in using the *exact* mandated activity wording. **(Medium -0.5 pt loss)**

**4. Extra/Missing Steps or Details:**
- The LLM splits "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" as a distinct step (from the informal description), but the ground truth treats this inside "Release Payment" and doesn’t break it out.
- The notification/information flows do not include all parties from the ground truth (especially "Operations Manager" is omitted as Informed or Accountable). **(Minor -0.5 pt loss)**

**5. Markdown Format:**
- The RACI is formatted in Markdown as requested. **(No loss)**

### Summary

Given the strict mandate for vocabulary, RACI mapping, and role coverage, the LLM answer has moderate fidelity (all major entities present, correct general process mapping), but (1) fails to include all roles as per ground truth, (2) deviates on key RACI assignments, (3) is slightly loose in activity naming, and (4) omits several required "Consulted"/"Informed" relationships crucial for process governance.

**Score rationale:**  
- Start from 10.0  
- -2.5 for omission of a key role  
- -1 for multiple RACI mapping errors and omissions  
- -0.5 for activity naming inexactness  
- -0.5 for missing information/consulted/informed assignments
