The LLM answer correctly arrives at the conclusion ("No") and gives the correct justification for Rule 3; it also correctly states that Rule 1 is violated, but this is actually incorrect. In the trace, "Quality_Engineer_Review" does in fact come before "Regulatory_Affairs_Review", and both appear exactly once, satisfying Rule 1.

- Major error: Incorrectly claims Rule 1 is violated when it is satisfied. This is a significant error, as it misrepresents which rule is the source of non-compliance.
- Moderate positive: Correctly identifies Rule 3 violation as the primary compliance failure.
- Minor issues: Does not explicitly comment on Rules 2 and 4; for full accuracy, all rules should be referenced, even if satisfied (as in the ground truth).

Due to the significant misclassification of Rule 1 and the lack of comprehensive justification for all rules, a strict score is warranted.
