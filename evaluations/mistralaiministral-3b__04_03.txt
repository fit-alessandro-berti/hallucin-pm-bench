3.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No"), which aligns with the ground truth. However, it incurs a major factual error by incorrectly claiming Rule 1 is violated (QE does precede RA once each, satisfying Rule 1; the LLM confuses this with Rule 3's NA timing). It also fails to assess Rules 2 and 4 (both satisfied per ground truth) and provides an incomplete, unstructured justification that doesn't reference all rules as required. Under utmost strictness, this misrepresentation of Rule 1 and omission of full rule coverage warrant a low score despite the correct final answer.
