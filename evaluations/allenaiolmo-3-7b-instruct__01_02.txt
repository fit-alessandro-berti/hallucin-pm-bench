**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (major errors, ~50% of prompt weight; score impact: -4.5 points)**:
  - LLM lists **5 items** vs. ground truth's **3** core decision points; inflates with non-decision steps/outcomes (e.g., #2 "Neighbourhood Feedback Check" is a mandatory collection step, not a conditional "decision point" like the gates in GT; #5 "Auto-approval" is an *outcome* of Amount Threshold Decision, not a standalone point).
  - Imprecise/missing exact terminology: "Amount Threshold" (omits "Decision"); "Micro-loan Board Approval" (omits "Final" and "(MBA)"); no mention of "escalate to Harmonisation Committee"; vague phrasing like "€15 000 cutoff for board involvement" vs. GT's precise conditions ("If amount < €15 000 ⇒ system auto-approves; if ≥ €15 000 ⇒ send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval").
  - Lacks GT's conditional details (e.g., "scores differ by ≤ 2 ⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate"; "board votes **Approve** or **Reject**"); introduces unprompted summaries.
  - Violates "use exactly the activity names given": invents "Auto-approval"; alters names.

- **Required Documents (minor strengths/variations, ~50% weight; score impact: -1.3 points)**:
  - Lists all 6 correctly and comprehensively (matches system prompt exactly, e.g., "single pay-stub or tax slip"; includes "template" for CIS which GT abbreviates).
  - Tiny wording diffs deduct points strictly: "≤ 3 months old" (GT: "≤ 3 months"); no GT's extra note ("No credit bureau report...") or numbering/abbrevs.
  - Still near-perfect, but strictness penalizes any deviation from GT format (bullets vs. numbered; no parenthetical note).

- **Overall Structure/Formatting (minor deduct: -0.0)**: Bold headings ok, but lacks GT's "####" headers, italics/bold in conditions, and explanatory note.
- **Total**: Starts at 10.0, deducts heavily for decision points' structural/terminology errors (core to prompt); documents save minor points. Utmost strictness applied—multiple "small" mismatches compound to significant loss.
