**Evaluation:**

**Vocabulary Policy Compliance:**
- The LLM answer preserves the four mandated terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) with zero synonym leakage in the matrix. ✅
- However, it introduces unauthorized/renamed activities (“Approval”, “Scheduling Payment”, “Notifying Originating Analyst”, “Releasing Funds”) instead of only activities defined by the vocabulary policy or the process narrative using only the four permitted phrases. “Approval” is an ambiguous renaming of “Compliance Officer Approval”; “Scheduling Payment” and “Releasing Funds” do not match “Release Funds” as in the ground truth, and “Notifying Originating Analyst” is not an original activity per the vocabulary policy or scenario (“notify” is an action, but not an activity that should be listed).

**Structural Accuracy:**
- The ground truth matrix has only six activities, each tightly mapped to permitted names or properly narrative-derived activity names. The LLM matrix unnecessarily splits or expands activities and deviates from the required labels.
- Activities in the LLM output (“Approval”, “Scheduling Payment”, “Releasing Funds”, and “Notifying Originating Analyst”) either use unauthorized terms or are not in the ground truth, which explicitly forbids merging, renaming, or adding activities.

**RACI Attribution:**
- Responsibility (“R”/“A”) is misapplied in several rows:
  - “Risk Scoring” is both R and A for the Compliance Analyst; per ground truth, the analyst is Responsible, while the Compliance Officer is Accountable.
  - “Approval” in the LLM matrix (intended to represent “Compliance Officer Approval”) doesn’t clarify who is Consulted or Informed.
  - No clear differentiation for roles Consulted (C) and Informed (I)—these assignments are either missing or incorrectly omitted from most rows.

**Other Policy Compliance:**
- Omits correct “C” (Consulted) and “I” (Informed) assignments seen in ground truth.
- Uses single “R/A” notation everywhere for a single role per activity, which is oversimplified and not present in ground truth.

**Formatting:**
- The table formatting is functional and clear.

**Overall:**
- While correct required vocabulary is used for the four activity names (thus *not* getting the lowest possible score), unauthorized activity names and significant errors in RACI role allocation mean this submission substantively fails strict compliance per the instructions—especially “do not rename, merge, or add activities.”
- Several activities are missing, and several are unapproved additions. Role attribution errors are serious.

**Conclusion:**  
- Severe deduction for unauthorized activities, incorrect RACI mapping, and incomplete coverage of “Consulted” and “Informed.”
- Some credit for usage of required terms where present and table formatting.

**Score: 4.0**
