### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no disallowed synonyms leaking in. However, it fails significantly on other criteria, warranting a low score under strict evaluation:

- **Added unauthorized activities**: The prompt instructs "do not ... add activities." The LLM introduces four extra rows ("Approval", "Scheduling Payment", "Releasing Funds", "Notifying Originating Analyst") not present in the ground truth or strictly derived from the narrative without expansion. This violates the rule against adding, even if attempting to cover the full process. Ground truth adds only two necessary extensions ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds") to fully represent the narrative without excess.

- **Incorrect or incomplete RACI assignments**: Major divergences from ground truth, missing key roles and responsibilities:
  - "Intake Vetting": LLM assigns only Front-Office Analyst (R/A) with blanks elsewhere; ground truth includes Compliance Analyst (C) and Treasury Ops (I).
  - "KYC Review" and "AML Screening": LLM assigns only Compliance Analyst (R/A); ground truth adds Compliance Officer (C) and Treasury Ops (I) for both.
  - "Risk Scoring": LLM assigns only Compliance Analyst (R/A); ground truth differentiates with Compliance Analyst (R), Compliance Officer (A), Front-Office Analyst (C), and Treasury Ops (I).
  - Additional rows in LLM (e.g., "Approval" as generic instead of "Compliance Officer Approval"; separate "Scheduling Payment" and "Notifying Originating Analyst" not in ground truth) introduce inaccuracies. Ground truth's "Release Funds" consolidates release/notification, with broader involvement (e.g., Informed/Consulted across roles), which LLM fragments incorrectly.

- **Format and structure issues**: Uses blanks for no involvement (vs. ground truth's "â€“"); formats "R/A" without commas or bolding (minor, but inconsistent with ground truth's "**R, A**"). Table covers all roles but does not accurately reflect "every activity and role" without merging/adding errors.

- **Overall fidelity**: The answer captures basic Responsible/Accountable for the core four activities but ignores nuanced Consulted/Informed roles, escalation logic, and process flow. This results in an incomplete and inaccurate matrix, with ~60-70% deviation in content from ground truth. No credit for partial correctness offsets the strict prohibition on additions and the depth of RACI errors.
