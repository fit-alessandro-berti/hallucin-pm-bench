3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Structure and Format (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The LLM answer uses a basic Markdown table but lacks the ground truth's header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), bolded **R** indicators, and explicit legend. It combines "RA" in single cells (non-standard for RACI, where roles are distinctly assigned per category), and includes an extraneous column setup without the required "Operations Manager" role. The table omits consultations/informations for many tasks, leaving cells blank instead of specifying C/I where applicable.
  
- **Roles and Coverage (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: Missing the "Operations Manager" column entirely, which is present in the ground truth and distributes accountability (A) across tasks. IT Support is included correctly, but the LLM introduces inconsistencies like assigning "R" to IT Support for "Notify the Regulatory Liaison" without proper context. Mandated roles ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") are used, but the absence of the fourth role creates incomplete coverage.

- **Tasks and Wording (Moderate Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Most tasks map to the source (e.g., "KYC Review" is used correctly and mandated), but phrasing differs (e.g., LLM's verbose "Perform the KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary" vs. ground truth's concise "**KYC Review**"). Extra task ("Notify the Regulatory Liaison") is added, splitting source step 6 unnecessarily, while ground truth consolidates (no separate SWIFT or notify rows). "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record" is a minor phrasing mismatch.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: Assignments diverge significantly from ground truth across all tasks. Examples:
  - "Receive...": LLM (Transaction Analyst: RA) vs. ground truth (Transaction Analyst: **R**, Regulatory Liaison: I, Operations Manager: **A**, IT Support: C).
  - "KYC Review": LLM (Regulatory Liaison: RA) vs. ground truth (Transaction Analyst: C, Regulatory Liaison: **R**, Operations Manager: **A**, IT Support: I).
  - "Release Payment": LLM (Transaction Analyst: RA) vs. ground truth (Transaction Analyst: **R**, Regulatory Liaison: I, Operations Manager: **A**, IT Support: C).
  - No alignment on high-risk approval, sanctions screening, or archiving. The combined RA and blanks ignore full RACI distribution.

- **Adherence to Prompt/Mandate (Minor Credit: +3.0 base, no further deduction)**: Uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") without violations like "CDD" or "Compliance Officer". Covers all source steps without omissions, but interpretations (e.g., separating SWIFT/notify) deviate.

Overall, the LLM answer captures the core intent and vocabulary but fails on precision, completeness, and fidelity to the ground truth's structure/assignments, warranting a low score under strict evaluation. Small issues (phrasing, extras) compound with major ones (missing role, wrong RACI).
