The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth by correctly refusing to provide a numeric value and explaining the absence of necessary temporal data (timestamps/elapsed times) as the barrier to calculation. It effectively captures the core reasoning without fabrication, adhering to the system's policy. Minor deductions for slight wording variations (e.g., "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; omission of explicit mention of "ordering information" or the risk of "fabrication") and not separating the response into numbered parts matching the user's two questions, though these do not substantively alter the correctness or completeness.
