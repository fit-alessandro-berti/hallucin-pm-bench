**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth with no errors:

- Q1: Exact match (**1**).
- Q2a: Exact match (**2.08%**, with calculation; minor space in % is stylistic, not substantive).
- Q2b: Exact match (**8.33%**, with calculation).
- Q3: ≤100 words (58 words); covers all required elements—(i) single occurrence/low-support, (ii) instability (outlier, skew metrics, overfit/ignore rare path), (iii) over-generalisation caution (mislead models, misestimate behaviour/resources). Conceptually aligns with sample (e.g., cycle times, predictive issues) without invention.
