The LLM answer is functionally perfect, correctly identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and both gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment from exclusive to parallel). No extra or missing changes, no commentary, adheres to structure.  

However, under utmost strictness:  
- Leading hyphens ("-") before each of the three headings (absent in ground truth): -0.3  
- Indentation (2 spaces before sub-bullets): -0.4  
- Missing alignment spaces on second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel"): -0.3  

Pure content match would be 10.0; minor formatting diffs deduct 1.0 total.
