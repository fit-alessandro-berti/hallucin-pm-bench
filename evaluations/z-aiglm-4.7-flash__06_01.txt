9.0  
The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs with proper alphabetical ordering (within pairs and overall list). No extraneous pairs or content. However, under utmost strictness, minor formatting discrepancies deduct 1.0 point:  
- Single spaces around "—" vs. ground truth's double spaces ("  —  ").  
- Lack of column alignment via extra leading spaces on the second line (e.g., "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines").  
- No enclosing code block (```), as shown in ground truth presentation.  
Content is flawless; only whitespace/alignment precision issues prevent 10.0.
