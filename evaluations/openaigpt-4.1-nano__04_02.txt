4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Major error (Violated vs. Compliant; incorrect interpretation of sequence—Manager_Approval precedes Finance_Approval as required). -2.0 points.
- **R2**: Major error (Not Applicable vs. Violated; overlooked expedited=true and timing post-change approval). -2.0 points.
- **R3**: Correct status and justification. +1.5 points.
- **R4**: Correct. +1.5 points.
- **R5**: Major error (Not Applicable vs. Violated; missed Change_Request after initial approvals and pre-new-approval actions like Ship_Goods/Pay_Invoice). -2.0 points.
- **R6**: Correct. +1.5 points.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by multiple rule misassessments. +2.0 points.
- **Format/Conciseness**: Minor deviations (no table, but prompt allows flexibility; justifications ≤20 words). No deduction.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Significant content inaccuracies (3/6 rules fully wrong) reflect poor trace analysis, justifying low score despite partial accuracy.
