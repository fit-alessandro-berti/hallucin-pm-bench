The LLM answer is completely correct and matches the ground truth in every respect:

- Q1: Correctly identifies there are 3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003).
- Q2: Correctly lists, in order and with the right separator (“→”), the sequence of activities for C002: Receive_Order→Check_Stock→Arrange_Delivery→Ship_Order.
- Q3: Correctly determines and alphabetizes the distinct activities that immediately precede “Ship_Order”: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock.

There are no extraneous elements, missing details, or misinterpretations. The LLM even clearly explains its reasoning at each step (which is allowed and useful), but the final answers are concise and exact as required.

No errors, omissions, or hallucinations—even at a strict level.
