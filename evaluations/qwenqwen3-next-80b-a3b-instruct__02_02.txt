The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, with correct factual content for all three questions matching the ground truth. Q1 is exact. Q2 matches the sequence precisely, though it omits spaces around "â†’" (ground truth includes them), which is a minor formatting deviation warranting a small deduction under strict evaluation. Q3 matches the distinct activities and alphabetical order exactly, though it uses plain lines instead of bulleted HTML formatting (another minor presentation difference, not affecting content). No hallucinations, extras, or factual errors, but the strictness on small inconsistencies prevents a perfect score.
