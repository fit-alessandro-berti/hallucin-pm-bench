The LLM answer makes several significant errors relative to the ground truth, with multiple points of deviation from strict requirements:

**Strengths:**
- Uses only the authorized vocabulary for activity names in the table (no synonyms like "Preliminary Assessment").
- Roles are correct.
- The matrix format is present and clean.
- No prohibited synonyms appear anywhere in the table.

**Major Errors:**
1. **Activity List:**
   - Adds two activities not present in the ground truth: "Payment Scheduling" and "Notification to Originating Analyst".
   - Uses "Funds Release" instead of "Release Funds" (minor, but still a loss per instruction strictness).
   - Splits "Release Funds" and "Notification to Originating Analyst", when the ground truth only includes "Release Funds".
2. **RACI Assignments:**
   - In Intake Vetting: Fails to mark Compliance Analyst as "C" and Treasury Ops as "I".
   - In KYC Review and AML Screening: Incorrectly makes Compliance Officer "A" (should only "C"), and omits "I" for Treasury Ops in all three (KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring).
   - In Risk Scoring: Fails to mark Compliance Officer as "A" (marks both Analyst as "R" & Officer as "A", but also marks Officer as "A" in KYC and AML, which are incorrect).
   - In Compliance Officer Approval: Marks Treasury Ops and Front-Office Analyst as "I" (should be “–” and "I", respectively).
   - In Funds Release: Marks Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer as "I" (should be "C" each), and fails to mark Front-Office Analyst as "I".

**Summary:**  
While surface-level vocabulary compliance is strong, activity naming and RACI mapping are inaccurate in several places. Extra activities, role responsibilities, and some minor naming slippage cost substantial points under "utmost strictness".
