### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, without synonyms or leaks. Additional activity names avoid disallowed terms, earning some points here. However, strict policy requires no renaming or additions, which impacts the overall score.
- **Activities Covered (Major Deduction)**: The prompt demands covering *every activity and role described* without renaming, merging, or *adding* activities. The LLM adds two extraneous activities ("Payment Scheduling", "Notification to Originating Analyst") not present in the ground truth and splits "Release Funds" into separate "Payment Scheduling" and "Funds Release" rows, violating "do not add" and "do not rename/merge". The ground truth consolidates into 6 precise activities, making this a significant error (e.g., notification is implied but not explicitly matrixed in ground truth, and scheduling/release are merged). This alone warrants heavy point loss under utmost strictness.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction)**: Assignments diverge substantially from ground truth across nearly all rows, with small but critical errors compounding:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst (I vs. C), Treasury Ops (- vs. I) – incorrect involvement levels.
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office (- vs. I), Compliance Analyst (R vs. R,A), Compliance Officer (A vs. C), Treasury Ops (I vs. -) – multiple mismatches in responsibility/accountability.
  - **AML Screening**: Same as KYC Review – identical errors.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office (I vs. C), Treasury Ops (- vs. I) – shifts in consultation/informed roles.
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Treasury Ops (I vs. -) – minor but strict deduction for unneeded involvement.
  - Extra rows: Entirely fabricated RACI (e.g., "Payment Scheduling" assigns R,A to Treasury Ops with I to others, not matching ground truth's merged "Release Funds").
  These are not minor; even single-cell differences (e.g., I vs. C) reflect significant loss per instructions, and cumulative errors across roles/activities amplify this.
- **Formatting (Minor Deduction)**: Markdown table is mostly clean, but lacks ground truth's bolding (e.g., **R, A**) on key cells and has inconsistent spacing/alignment (e.g., dashes vs. em-dashes). Header rows differ slightly in padding. No explanatory text added, which is good, but overall polish is off.
- **Overall Fidelity**: While the core structure attempts a RACI matrix and uses authorized vocab, the additions, mergers/omissions, and pervasive RACI inaccuracies create too many differences from ground truth. Under strict evaluation, this is a flawed response, scoring low but not zero due to partial vocab adherence and no outright policy violations like synonym use.
