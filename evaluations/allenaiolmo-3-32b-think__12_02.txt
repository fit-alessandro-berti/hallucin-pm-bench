The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in identifying both key counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11) with precise citations, correctly disproving the "always follows" claim. It adheres to the instruction format ("No" followed by one-paragraph justification using case-IDs and line numbers). Minor deductions for: (1) extraneous mention of C001 and C004 (correct but absent from ground truth, adding unrequested detail); (2) slightly different phrasing ("inaccurate" vs. "false"; "no preceding" vs. "never contains"; "disproves the universal assertion" vs. "prove ... does not always"); (3) single paragraph vs. ground truth's bulleted structure. No factual errors, but strict matching penalizes these differences.
