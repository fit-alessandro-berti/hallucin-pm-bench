The LLM answer is functionally correct, semantically identical to the ground truth (enforces SLA via interrupting 48h boundary timer on "Create Account" routing to existing "Activity_AMReview"), and adheres to the task constraints perfectly. Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for: (1) omitting `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<timeDuration>` (small syntactic inconsistency with original XML style and potential schema strictness issue, though often tool-tolerant); (2) lacking `name="48h breach"` on boundaryEvent (cosmetic but present in ground truth). All other differences (IDs, comment absence, justification wording/formatting) are negligible/equivalent under strict BPMN validity and task requirements.
