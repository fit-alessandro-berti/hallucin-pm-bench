**10.0**

The LLM answer is a near-perfect match to the ground truth under strict evaluation:

- Q1: Exact match (**1**).
- Q2a: Exact (**2.08%** vs. **2.08 %**; space is trivial formatting, calculation identical).
- Q2b: Exact (**8.33%** vs. **8.33 %**; same).
- Q3: Fully compliant (≤100 words; mentions single occurrence "only one instance"; notes variance/instability via "scarcity may lead to underestimating impact," "overlook dependencies," "distorting analysis"; cautions over-generalisation via "generalizations... fail to capture rare but significant behaviors"). No inventions; data-only. Insightful for process mining. No errors.
