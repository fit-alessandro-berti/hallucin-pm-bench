9.8

**Assessment:**

- **Q1/A1:** Correct. 3 distinct cases. No error.
- **Q2/A2:** Correct sequence, correct formatting with "â†’", activity names match the ground truth (minor difference: answer bolded activity names rather than code-style, but that's a negligible formatting choice, not a factual error).
- **Q3/A3:** Correct results ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), correct alphabetical order, and lists one per line. The formatting in the LLM (code block) and use of plain text vs required underscores in activity names (i.e., "Arrange_Delivery" not "Arrange\_Delivery") is a very minor deviation.

**Reason for partial deduction:**  
There is a very slight deviation in Q3: the ground truth answer shows underscores as literal ("Arrange\_Delivery") matching the input data, whereas in the LLM answer, the output is "Arrange_Delivery" (with an underscore, not a space), but without any code formatting or escaping as in the prompt: "Arrange\_Delivery". If one is absolutely strict, the output should be visually identical to the log, including escaping if required.

Therefore, given the utmost strictness criteria and the required exactness, a minor deduction of 0.2 is warranted for this microscopic difference. No factual errors.
