The LLM answer is factually precise and complete across all questions, with no missing, incorrect, or fabricated elements. Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003), matching the ground truth number, though it includes unrequested enumeration of the cases (minor extra detail, deducting 0.5 for strict adherence to "how many" without elaboration). Q2 exactly matches the ground truth sequence for C002, but adds an introductory phrase ("The sequence of activities for case **"C002"** is:"), which is extra verbosity (minor deduction of 0.5). Q3 correctly lists the two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) alphabetically, one per line as prompted, with no extras in the list itself; however, it includes an unrequested header and uses a code block for formatting, diverging slightly from the ground truth's dashed list style (minor deduction of 0.5). Overall, the response is highly accurate but incurs small penalties for non-essential additions and formatting variances under utmost strictness.
