**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major flaws (heavy point deduction)**: 
  - Uses invalid `<bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent attachedToRef="...">` – BPMN 2.0 reserves `attachedToRef` **exclusively for `<boundaryEvent>`**; intermediate catch events cannot attach to tasks this way and must be inline in flows (invalid XML → -4.0).
  - Lacks `cancelActivity="true"` (interrupting), so timer is non-interrupting by default; task "Create Account" continues post-timeout, failing to **enforce** SLA (critical for compliance → -2.0).
- **Minor flaws (further deduction)**:
  - Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<timeDuration>` (matches XML schema precision in ground truth → -0.5).
  - Justification omits "interrupting boundary timer" specificity and bolding emphasis; vaguely says "attach a timer" without technical accuracy → -0.5).
  - No explanatory comments (e.g., ❶ ❷) for clarity → -0.2.
  - ID/name less descriptive ("Timer_Inline" vs "Boundary_LateCreate") → -0.3.
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly uses existing `Activity_AMReview` escalation path, `PT48H` duration, sequenceFlow connection, one-sentence format, and no new activities (+1.0 base for intent). Total reflects ~65% structural similarity but fatal technical inaccuracies.
