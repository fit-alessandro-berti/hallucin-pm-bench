2.0

### Rationale

**Added tasks**
- The LLM only listed `check_vip`, but failed to mention `generate_qr`, which is present in v2 and not in v1. This is a significant omission. (-3 points)

**Removed tasks**
- The LLM wrongly listed `reject_return` as removed, but it exists in both versions (same id, same name). It failed to notice that `send_rma_label` was the actual removed task. This is a major factual error. (-3 points)

**Gateway type changes**
- Correctly identified the change from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway` for `gw_valid`. (no deduction)

**Other**
- Minor deduction due to lack of element name/id formatting as per the XML, but this is less critical. (-2 points)

**Total deduction:** 3 (added task missing) + 3 (removed task incorrect) + 2 (format/field precision) = -8 points
