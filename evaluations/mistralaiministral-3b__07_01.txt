The LLM answer has critical inaccuracies in the core factual differences: it misses one added task ("generate_qr") and incorrectly identifies a removed task ("reject_return" is present in both versions; the actual removal is "send_rma_label"). The gateway change is correctly identified but formatted inconsistently with the prompt's requirements (e.g., headings use "###" instead of "â€¢", and phrasing differs from ground truth). These errors, including small formatting issues, warrant a significant deduction under strict criteria, despite partial correctness on one added task and the gateway.
