The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and the specific violation of Rule 3, with accurate qualitative assessments of all rules (satisfied or violated). However, it contains multiple factual errors in the justifications: incorrect step numbering throughout (e.g., RA at step 6 instead of 5, VP at 7 instead of 6, CC at 8 instead of 7), which misrepresents the trace sequence and undermines the precision of the reasoning. The ground truth avoids such errors by using qualitative reasoning without numbering. Under utmost strictness, these significant inaccuracies in details warrant a substantial deduction, despite the core conclusion being correct.
