9.0

The LLM answer provides both correct pairs and in the correct alphabetical order within each pair, per the instructions. It outputs:

Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines  
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check

The only minor issue is that the overall ordering of the pairs is not alphabetical: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" should appear before "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" in the list (per the ground truth). This small error warrants a significant penalty, as per your strictness instructions. Everything else is accurate. Thus, a 9.0 is appropriate.
