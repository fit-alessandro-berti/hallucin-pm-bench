9.0

The LLM answer is factually correct and aligns closely with the ground truth in content, including accurate identification of cases, the preceding activity, and the unique activity. However, it loses points for minor deviations in formatting and conciseness: it uses explanatory phrasing and quotes for Q2 and Q3 (e.g., full sentences instead of isolated activity names), and slight wording variations like "distinct cases" vs. exact "cases," which do not match the ground truth's brevity and structure precisely. Under strict evaluation, these small stylistic differences warrant a deduction from a perfect score.
