9.0

- The LLM answer is highly accurate and concise.
- Q1: "3 distinct cases" is correct, but the ideal answer would have listed the case IDs (C123, C456, C789) as in the ground truth. Missing the explicit mention of the case values, there is a minor loss of detail.
- Q2: "Pack_Items" is correct.
- Q3: "Cancel_Order" is correct.
- Small deduction for lack of case ID enumeration in answer 1.
