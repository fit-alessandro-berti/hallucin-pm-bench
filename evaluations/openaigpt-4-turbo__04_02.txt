**7.5**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Statuses match perfectly** (all 6 rules: R1 Compliant, R2/R3/R5 Violated, R4 Not Applicable, R6 Compliant; overall NON-COMPLIANT): + full credit.
- **Format**: Close (bulleted list with bolded **R#: Status** + justification), but differs from ground truth table; extra title "**Analysis...**"; minor deductions for not exactly matching presentation (-0.5).
- **Justifications** (all ≤20 words, good):
  - R1/R3/R4/R6: Nearly identical in meaning and detail (0 differences or trivial rephrasing).
  - R5: Similar, correctly identifies violation post-Finance_Approval before Ship_Goods, but omits Pay_Invoice mention (-0.3; slightly less complete).
  - R2: Status correct (Violated), but **major flaws**: (1) Factual error—"3 days" after 03-04 is incorrect (actually ~1 calendar day, within limit if ignoring change); (2) Misses key ground truth point (final approval after change on 07-Mar, making Ship_Goods premature/not after last approval); wrong reasoning despite right status (-2.0 significant loss per strictness on errors/differences).
- **Overall**: High alignment on outcomes (10/10 there), but strict deduction for R2 errors and minor format/R5 diff yields 7.5. Small factual error alone warrants >10% loss.
