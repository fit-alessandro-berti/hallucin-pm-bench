6.5

- Q1 is correct (no error).
- Q2 is correct (no error).
- Q3: The LLM answer incorrectly includes "Receive_Order" (which never immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in the fragment). The correct immediate predecessors are "Check_Stock" and "Arrange_Delivery" only. This is a substantive factual error, as it introduces a non-existent predecessor, though the two correct predecessors are listed properly and in the correct order.
- Naming/Casing: The activities are printed as in the prompt (not with underscores as in ground truth). This is a minor stylistic mismatch, losing some precision.
- Overall: 1 large factual error (hallucinated predecessor), 1 small stylistic/casing error.

Given the notable, but not catastrophic, factual error in Q3 and a small loss for style, a score of 6.5 reflects strict grading: Q1 and Q2 are perfect, but the error in Q3 must subtract significant points.
