4.0

Rationale:  
- **R1**: Correct. (Compliant – sequence of approvals for amount > €10,000.)  
- **R2**: Wrong. LLM says Compliant, but did not account that a new Manager_Approval must follow the Change_Request before Ship_Goods (ground truth marks as Violated). This is a serious rule misapplication.
- **R3**: Correctly marked as Violated.
- **R4**: Correct. (hazardous = false, so Not Applicable.)
- **R5**: Wrong. LLM says Compliant, but events Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before new Manager_Approval (should be Violated).
- **R6**: Correct.

**Scoring justification**:
- There are 3 major errors: R2 and R5 are incorrectly marked Compliant (when both are Violated in ground truth), and their justifications miss the subtlety about post-Change_Request approval dependencies. These are significant compliance misses.
- R3, R4, R1, and R6 are correctly assessed.
- All in all, the answer gets half of the rules correct. Given the high importance of precision in auditing and process compliance (as requested), missing these core violations is serious.  
- The required format, overall decision (NON-COMPLIANT), justifications are provided and succinct.

**4.0** reflects serious logic errors with otherwise correct format and accurate handling of part of the requirements, but severe compliance evaluation mistakes per auditor standards as requested.
