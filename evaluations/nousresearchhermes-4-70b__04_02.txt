The LLM answer correctly identifies compliance for R1, R3, R4, and R6, with matching statuses and concise justifications. However, it errs critically on R2 (incorrectly deems Compliant, ignoring the need for new approval after Change_Request, which delays the "last required approval" to March 7, making Ship_Goods untimely) and R5 (incorrectly deems Compliant, overlooking that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice precede the new Manager_Approval, violating the "no further processing" rule). These are major factual misinterpretations of the trace and rules, leading to incomplete violation detection. Overall result is correct but undermined by flawed reasoning. Strict deduction for two key rule errors reflects substantial deviation from ground truth.
