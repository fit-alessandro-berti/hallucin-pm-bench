The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can execute in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in correct alphabetical order both within pairs and overall, and uses the required one-pair-per-line format with appropriate spacing around the em dashes ("  —  "). No extra or missing pairs, fully matching the semantic requirements and rationale.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for small formatting discrepancies versus ground truth:
- Lacks precise character alignment of the em dashes (ground truth pads second line with 5 spaces before "—" to vertically align at column ~22; LLM uses consistent 2 spaces, unaligned).
- No leading empty line or enclosing code block (ground truth uses markdown ```` for presentation).
- Possible minor trailing whitespace differences on first line (rendering-dependent).

These are small presentational errors, but per instructions warrant significant point loss under utmost strictness; content perfection prevents lower score.
