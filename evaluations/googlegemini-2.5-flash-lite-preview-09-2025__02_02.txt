8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Exact match to ground truth (3). No issues. Full credit.
- **Q2**: Exact match to ground truth in sequence, activities (with underscores), and separator (â†’, rendered equivalently via LaTeX). Explanation accurately lists lines 2, 5, 8, 10. Full credit.
- **Q3**: Final listed activities match ground truth exactly (distinct, alphabetically ordered: Arrange_Delivery then Check_Stock; one per line). However, the explanation contains a factual error/hallucination: it incorrectly describes Line 8 (which is *an* Arrange_Delivery event, not a Ship_Order) as "Line 8 (C002): Preceded by `Arrange_Delivery`," fabricating a nonexistent Ship_Order at that line and an illogical predecessor. This is a significant reasoning flaw (misreading the log), treated as a hallucination per guidelines, warranting a deduction despite correct conclusion. Minor formatting difference (no dashes vs. ground truth's "- " bullets) is negligible.

Overall: Strong alignment in core answers (93% fidelity), but strict deduction for the erroneous reasoning element reduces from perfect.
