The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Structure mismatch**: The LLM uses a task-row format with R/A/C/I columns filled by role names, while the ground truth uses roles as columns with R/A/C/I letters in cells. This is a fundamental format difference for a RACI table.
- **Roles discrepancy**: The LLM omits "Operations Manager" (present as a key accountable role in nearly every ground truth row) and incorrectly assigns accountabilities/responsibilities without it, using only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support. This ignores the ground truth's role composition.
- **Task coverage and wording errors**: The LLM includes 8 tasks (adding separate "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of archived case," splitting the source's step 6 explicitly), while the ground truth has exactly 6 consolidated tasks. Wording differs (e.g., LLM's verbose "Receive the customerâ€™s transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM's "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record"). The ground truth integrates SWIFT into "Release Payment" and implies notification in "Archive Record," but the LLM's extras are unsubstantiated additions/omissions relative to the ground truth mapping.
- **RACI assignments inaccurate**: Nearly every task has mismatched assignments. Examples:
  - "Receive": LLM (R/A: Transaction Analyst, I: Regulatory Liaison) vs. ground truth (R: Transaction Analyst, A: Operations Manager, I: Regulatory Liaison, C: IT Support).
  - "Screen": LLM (R/A: Transaction Analyst, I: Regulatory Liaison) vs. ground truth (R: Transaction Analyst, A: Regulatory Liaison, I: Operations Manager, C: IT Support).
  - "KYC Review": LLM (R/A: Regulatory Liaison, I: Transaction Analyst) vs. ground truth (R: Regulatory Liaison, A: Operations Manager, C: Transaction Analyst, I: IT Support).
  - Similar swaps/mismatches in "Approve," "Release," and "Archive"; LLM's extra tasks have no ground truth equivalents.
- **Missing elements**: No legend, bolding of "KYC Review," or post-table notes as in the ground truth. While the LLM adheres to mandated vocabulary (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst), this minor alignment does not offset the extensive deviations in coverage, assignments, and fidelity to the ground truth's exact structure and content.
- **Overall fidelity**: The response fails to "map every step from the source text to the mandated terminology without omissions or substitutions" as exemplified in the ground truth, introducing unsubstantiated splits and ignoring the accountable role hierarchy centered on Operations Manager. Even small inconsistencies (e.g., task phrasing, empty cells vs. letters) compound to total non-equivalence.
