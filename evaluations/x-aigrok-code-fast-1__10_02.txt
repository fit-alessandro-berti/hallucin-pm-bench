4.5

**Justification and Error Breakdown:**

- **Vocabulary Adherence:** The LLM answer correctly uses “KYC Review,” “Regulatory Liaison,” and “Transaction Analyst” per the mandate. However, it omits “Operations Manager” featured in the ground truth (though it was not an enforced term, it was present in the answer for RACI clarity).

- **Tasks/Activities Wording:** The LLM answer mostly paraphrases rather than strictly standardizes the activity naming (e.g., “Perform KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary” instead of simply “KYC Review”; “Receive the customer’s transfer instruction and log it in the system” instead of “Receive Payment Instruction”), leading to deviations from the concise mandated format seen in the ground truth.

- **Role Assignment Errors:**
    - The LLM answer misassigns Accountable/Responsible for several tasks versus the ground truth. For example, for “Screen Against Sanctions List,” both Responsible and Accountable are listed as Transaction Analyst, but the ground truth assigns Responsible to Transaction Analyst and Accountable to Regulatory Liaison.
    - The ground truth designates “Operations Manager” as Accountable for most tasks, but the LLM does not include this role at all.

- **Consulted/Informed Mistakes and Omissions:**
    - The LLM answer leaves Consulted blank for almost all steps, while the ground truth carefully maps C/I for each role.
    - The “Notify Regulatory Liaison of archived case” task in the LLM answer is not a separately defined activity in the ground truth; this step is combined there under archiving/informing roles.
    - Informed roles are inconsistently assigned (for archiving, for instance); the ground truth indicates that Regulatory Liaison and Transaction Analyst are Informed, whereas the LLM sometimes assigns IT Support.

- **Task Coverage:** The LLM splits and expands some steps unnecessarily (e.g., “Notify Regulatory Liaison of archived case”), while also failing to collapse or standardize steps as the ground truth does.

**Summary:** 
- Significant deductions for not matching activity wording, RACI allocations, and structure per the strict requirements and ground truth.  
- No explicit “Operations Manager” role (as per the possible expectation from the ground truth).
- Consulted/Informed assignments are incomplete.
- However, the enforced vocabulary for main roles is consistently used.  
- Table formatting is correct in Markdown and includes all main steps conceptually.

**Final score: 4.5 — Slightly below average due to errors in task naming, RACI allocation, missing roles, and uneven compliance with the structure and strict requirements.**
