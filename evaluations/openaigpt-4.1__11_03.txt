7.0

Reasoning:

- Correct identification of the three worst-performing activities: The LLM answer correctly selects Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment based on the joint criteria of SLA breach and high waiting time. No penalty.

- Accurate quantification of SLA breaches: The figures for SLA overages are correct for each activity and expressed clearly. No penalty.

- Waiting times: Accurately reported, in line with the table. No penalty.

- Recommendation format: Only uses bullet points for recommendations, as specified.

Errors and Omissions:

1. **Precision and Specificity of Recommendations (Significant)**:
    - The LLM's recommendations are considerably more generic and less data-driven than the ground truth. 
    - For example, the ground truth recommends "rule-based pre-checks" for Legal Approval and provides concrete numbers/actions ("add one risk analyst to peak morning window" and "automate external score retrieval"), while the LLM answer suggests general workload balancing or resource review, and does not cite specifics such as time windows or automation.
    - For Credit Assessment, the ground truth proposes a "straight-through" heuristic for loans under €25 k (specific, actionable), while LLM refers generically to optimizing upstream handover — a less data-grounded action.

2. **Detail on Case Volume**:
    - The ground truth references the sample size ("4,805 completed cases", from the sum of cases), which adds useful data grounding. The LLM omits this.

3. **Memo Titling and Structure**:
    - The subject lines and introductory phrasing differ, though both are appropriate. This is a minor issue but can represent a loss of professionalism or data-grounding.

4. **Projected Impact**:
    - The ground truth offers a quantified projection of process improvement ("reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35% and restore SLA compliance"). The LLM makes no such projection and thus is less complete.

5. **Strict instruction adherence**:
    - The LLM answer fully avoids mentioning any non-existent activities or metrics.

Given these factors, especially the lack of specificity and weaker data-grounding in its recommendations, which is the most critical shortfall, a loss of 3 points is warranted. The answer is factually sound but not nearly as specific or insightful as required for a top score.
