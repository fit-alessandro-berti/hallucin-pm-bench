### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Identification and Quantification (Strong Match, 9.0/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies the three worst activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth. Quantification of excesses is accurate and similarly phrased (e.g., +300s for Legal/Risk, +60s for Credit), with waiting times explicitly stated. No inventions here; fully grounded in table data.
  
- **Structure and Formatting (Good Match, 7.5/10)**: Memo format is present (To/From/Subject, body). Uses bullets only for recommendations as required. Activities are listed clearly, but the ground truth integrates them more concisely without numbering (LLM uses 1-3). Intro paragraph adds explanation not in ground truth, slightly bloating length beyond ≈150 words (LLM ~220 words vs. ground truth ~120). Subject and From differ (e.g., LLM's "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. ground truth's "Process Performance Office"), a minor but unnecessary deviation.

- **Recommendations (Weak Match, 4.0/10)**: Bulleted as required, but actions lack the concreteness and data-driven specificity of the ground truth. LLM's are vague/advisory (e.g., "Prioritize immediate review of resource allocation"; "Optimize upstream handover"; "Reevaluate case prioritization") without tying directly to metrics or proposing measurable interventions. Ground truth provides precise, actionable steps (e.g., "Introduce rule-based pre-checks"; "Add one risk analyst"; "Deploy a 'straight-through' heuristic"), even if they invent non-table details—LLM fails to match this level of practicality while staying more conservative (per prompt's "do NOT invent"). This is a significant shortfall in "concrete, data-driven" quality.

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness Penalties (-1.3 aggregate)**: No extraneous inventions (good), but order of activities mismatches ground truth (LLM starts with Risk Review instead of Legal Approval as the clear joint worst due to highest wait time), omitting ground truth extras like total cases (~4,805, derived from data) or projected impact. Strict lens: These small inconsistencies (order, phrasing, rec depth) and failure to emulate ground truth's succinct, impactful tone result in notable point loss. No criminal/jailbreak issues.
