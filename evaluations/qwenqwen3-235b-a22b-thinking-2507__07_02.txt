8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the exclusive-to-inclusive gateway change) matching the ground truth content. However, under utmost strictness, deduct 1.5 points total for: (1) inclusion of unrequested extra sections ("Rationale" and "Note"), violating the "strictly under the three requested headings" instruction (0.75 pt loss); (2) format deviations, such as bullet lists without numbering, ID-first ordering in task lists instead of name-first with parenthetical IDs, and less precise wording in the gateway change (e.g., no mention of XOR/OR semantics or explicit v1/v2 references) (0.5 pt loss); (3) minor inconsistencies like capitalized "Exclusive/Inclusive" vs. lowercase in ground truth, and an unrequested introductory heading (0.25 pt loss). No factual errors, but these small structural and stylistic mismatches warrant the penalty.
