9.5

The LLM answer is almost perfectly aligned with the ground truth answer:

- **Added tasks:** All three tasks (**Verify Identity**, **Request Additional Documents**, **Final Reject**) are correctly listed with their IDs and names.
- **Removed tasks:** The removed task (**Reject Loan**) is correctly identified.
- **Gateway-type changes:** Accurately identifies that **Gateway_Decision** changed from exclusive to inclusive.
- The LLM answer strictly follows the grouping under the three required headings.
- Cosmetic renamings and ordering are correctly ignored, as per instructions.

**Very minor deduction (0.5):**
- The LLM answer redundantly includes a "Rationale" section (with a bulleted summary of reasoning) and a minor duplicate statement at the end. The prompt asks for a strict summary under exactly the three headings, so this is slight over-fulfillment, though factual content is correct. While not a factual error, utmost strictness per instructions requires a small penalty for not adhering solely to the three headings and nothing more.

**Overall:**  
Score = **9.5**  
This is an almost model answer, with only a negligible deviation from the requested output format.
