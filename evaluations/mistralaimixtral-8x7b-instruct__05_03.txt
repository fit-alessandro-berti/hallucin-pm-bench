**2.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Criteria):
- **Major violation of core constraint ("without adding any new activities")**: LLM adds new elements treated as activities in BPMN (intermediateCatchEvent "Event_Escalation", new endEvent "End_SLABreach"), plus new sequenceFlows—directly contradicting the "no extra tasks" rule. Ground truth adds *only* a boundaryEvent (event, not activity) and reuses *existing* unused "Activity_AMReview" (-4.0 points).
- **Incorrect BPMN 2.0 XML structure/semantics**:
  - Invalid placement of `<bpmn:timerEventDefinition>` *inside* serviceTask (timers belong on events, not tasks; use boundaryEvent) (-1.5).
  - Wrong `<bpmn:incoming>Flow_03</bpmn:incoming>` (Flow_03 targets gateway, not task; original has Flow_04) (-1.0).
  - Uses `timeCycle` (cyclic) vs. ground truth `timeDuration` (one-shot); minor but strict loss (-0.3).
  - Escalation on catchEvent without proper escalationDefinition; non-interrupting design doesn't enforce deadline (-0.5).
  - Repeats/modifies full task unnecessarily vs. "only changed/added elements" (-0.3).
- **Misses key business insight**: Ignores pre-existing "Activity_AMReview" (noted as "unused escalation activity") for zero-new-activity escalation path (-0.2).
- **Justification**: One sentence but inaccurate (claims "no new activities" implicitly false; doesn't mention reusing existing path or interrupting enforcement) (-0.2).

Partial credit for correct timing (48h/PT48H post-"Verify Identity"), identifying "Create Account" task, and escalation *intent* (+1.0 total). Overall: severe deviations warrant minimal score.
