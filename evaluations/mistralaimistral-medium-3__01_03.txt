7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
**Part (a) - Decision Points (Score: 9.0/10):**  
The LLM answer accurately identifies and describes the two decision points in one sentence each, closely matching the ground truth in content and structure. Minor deductions for slight wording differences: (1) it omits the explicit "otherwise proceeds to that review" clause, making it less complete; (2) "approvals ... to proceed" vs. ground truth's "record 'Approve'" is a subtle but imprecise phrasing under strict evaluation. No hallucinations or extraneous details.

**Part (b) - Documents List (Score: 5.0/10):**  
Significant errors reduce this score: (1) Omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (first appearing in Step 8, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in Step 7), failing to list *all* documents; (2) Groups the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) into a single bullet instead of listing them separately as in the ground truth, altering the order-of-appearance presentation; (3) Adds unnecessary details like step numbers and "if applicable" for Deck Memo, which deviate from the ground truth's concise format. These are not small errorsâ€”omission of a document and structural changes indicate incomplete fidelity to the process description. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions).

**Overall Score Calculation:** Averaged across parts (weighted equally as per the prompt's structure), with strict penalties for b's substantive omissions and formatting issues. The answer is strong on accuracy for a but critically flawed on completeness for b, preventing a higher total.
