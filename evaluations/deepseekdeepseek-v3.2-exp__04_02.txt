The LLM answer correctly identifies compliance for R1, R3 (violation), R4 (not applicable), and R6, with appropriate overall non-compliance due to at least one violation. However, it errs significantly on R2 and R5 by classifying both as compliant, overlooking the impact of the Change_Request requiring new approval before further steps (leading to premature Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice), and misinterpreting the "last required approval" timing for the expedited shipping rule. Justifications for R2 and R5 are substantively incorrect, violating the strict evaluation criteria for accuracy and fidelity to the ground truth. Minor format adherence is present, but content discrepancies warrant a substantial deduction.
