The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect, reaching the opposite conclusion ("NO") to the ground truth ("YES") due to a critical misinterpretation of T4's enabling condition—it erroneously states T4 requires p3≥1 and p4=0 after T2 fires, when T4 actually requires both p3≥1 and p4≥1, leaving T5 enabled and choosable before T3. This invalidates the entire proof and sequence analysis, ignoring the reachable marking where T5 fires after T1/T2 but before T3. No partial credit is warranted under strict evaluation, as the core response directly contradicts the ground truth.
