The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content and accuracy for questions 1â€“3, with no deviations, inferences, or errors. For question 4, both provided reasons ("Time window limitation" aligning with "Temporal bias" and "Insufficient sample size" directly matching "Small sample size") are valid selections from the specified options, clearly stated without hallucination or extraneous assumptions. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., verbosity in reasoning) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation criteria, as the core outputs align fully.
