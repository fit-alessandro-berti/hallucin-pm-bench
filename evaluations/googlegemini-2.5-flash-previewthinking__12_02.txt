The LLM's answer correctly identifies that the statement is false, and provides a solid justification by referencing case C003 (lines 6 and 7), accurately noting the order of the activities. However, it does not mention case C005, where *Validate_Payment* occurs without any *Receive_Order* at all, which is a significant omission since this strengthens the justification and directly supports the "always" quantifier in the claim. Omitting this further counterexample is a non-trivial error and reflects in a notable point deduction in strict assessment.
