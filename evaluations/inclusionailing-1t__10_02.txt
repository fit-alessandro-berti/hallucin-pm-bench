### Evaluation Rationale
Under strict criteria, the LLM answer scores low due to multiple critical failures in completeness, adherence to mandated vocabulary, and fidelity to the prompt and source text. Key differences from the ground truth:

- **Incomplete Coverage (Major Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The LLM only addresses the first 3 steps of the 6-step informal description, omitting tasks 4 (approve high-risk transactions), 5 (release payment and send SWIFT message), and 6 (archive case file and notify). The ground truth maps *every* step explicitly without omissions. This alone renders the output ~50% incomplete, warranting severe penalty.

- **Misuse of Mandated Vocabulary (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM incorrectly treats "**KYC Review**" as a *role* (e.g., Responsible for Task 3, Informed in Tasks 1-2), violating the mandate that it is strictly an *activity* term replacing "customer due diligence." The ground truth uses it only as a task/activity label (e.g., "**KYC Review**" row). Additionally, the LLM introduces unsubstantiated qualifiers like "(as needed)" or "(if system-dependent)," which add non-mandated speculation not in the source or ground truth.

- **Format and Structure Deviations (Moderate Deduction: -0.5 points)**: While Markdown table is used, the LLM inverts the standard RACI presentation (roles in R/A/C/I cells vs. ground truth's roles as columns with R/A/C/I entries). It includes an extraneous **Note** section with explanations, which the prompt does not request (prompt specifies "Put the table in Markdown" and implies clean organization). Empty cells use "â€“" inconsistently, and no legend is provided (ground truth includes one for clarity).

- **Role Assignments and Inferences (Moderate Deduction: -1.0 points)**: Assignments are partially logical but inaccurate/incomplete. E.g., Task 3 assigns Responsible to "KYC Review" (invalid role) instead of "Regulatory Liaison" as in ground truth. It prematurely includes "IT Support" in Task 3 (not in source for that step) and ignores broader roles like "Operations Manager" implied in ground truth for accountability. No coverage of IT Support's explicit roles in steps 5-6.

Smaller issues (e.g., bolding inconsistencies, vague Informed entries like "KYC Review" as a recipient) compound the loss but are subsumed under the above. The output shows some effort to incorporate mandates (e.g., replacing "payment clerk" with "Transaction Analyst," using "Regulatory Liaison"), earning minimal baseline points, but overall deviations are too extensive for a higher score. A perfect match would require full task mapping, precise vocabulary use, and clean structure as in the ground truth.
