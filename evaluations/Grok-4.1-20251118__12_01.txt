10.0

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth in verdict, structure, and evidence: it correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate, provides a short justification citing case IDs (1001, 1002, 1003) and relevant activities/sequences, and accurately highlights the contradictions (reversed ordering in cases with both activities, absence in case 1002, no instance of the claimed immediate precedence). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., arrows vs. line citations, "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate") do not constitute errors under the prompt's requirements, as line numbers were not mandated.
