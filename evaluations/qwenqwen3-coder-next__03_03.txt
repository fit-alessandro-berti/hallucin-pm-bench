**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Grading)
- **Semantic structure differences (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: LLM adds an extra task ("Check warranty eligibility") and associated flows (wrc_flow04 to task, wrc_flow06 from task to warranty gateway), which ground truth omits by directly connecting completeness gateway "Yes" to warranty gateway. This violates "model **only** the flow elements explicitly mentioned" and rubric for deducting **extra/hallucinated tasks**. Despite text mentioning "checks warranty eligibility", the prompt's output bullets specify gateways for steps 2/3 without a task between validation/completeness and warranty decision, matching ground truth's minimal structure. LLM hallucinates this as a separate task.
- **Task names not verbatim (deduction: -1.0 points)**: Several mismatches vs. prompt's bolded text and ground truth:
  | Task | Prompt Bold | LLM Name | Ground Truth | Issue |
  |------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------|
  | Validate | "validates the claim" | "Validate claim" | "Validate the claim" | Missing "the", tense change |
  | Close | "close the claim" | "Close claim" | "Close the claim" | Missing "the" |
  Others close but capitalized/tweaked tense inconsistently.
- **Start event name mismatch (deduction: -0.5 points)**: LLM "Start" generic; prompt implies "online warranty claim"; ground truth "Online warranty claim submitted".
- **Extra content (deduction: -1.0 points)**: Full `<bpmndi:BPMNDiagram>` section (~150+ lines of shapes/edges/waypoints/labels) hallucinated—not in minimal ground truth or required by prompt (just "BPMN 2.0 XML document"). Adds invented layout positions (e.g., odd y="192.5").
- **Invented conditions/variables (deduction: -0.5 points)**: `<conditionExpression>` with unstated vars like `${isComplete}`, `${!isWithinWarranty}` violates "Do **not** invent ... beyond what is stated". Ground truth uses simple `name="Yes"/"No"` labels.
- **Minor differences (no further deduction, as allowed)**: Different IDs/gateway names/end names/verbose namespaces/sequenceFlow IDs (semantically equivalent per rubric).

Base 10.0 → total deductions = 6.0. LLM valid BPMN but deviates significantly from minimal-yet-complete ground truth and prompt constraints.
