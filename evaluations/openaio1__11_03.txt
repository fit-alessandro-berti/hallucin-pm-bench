6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as the worst-performing based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and it quantifies the excesses accurately (e.g., +300s for Legal and Risk, +60s for Credit), grounding them in the provided throughput and waiting metrics without invention. The recommendations are bulleted, one per activity, and data-driven by referencing specific times (e.g., 480s wait for Risk), adhering to the "bullet points only for recommendations" rule. The overall length is approximately 150 words, and it returns only memo text.

However, under strict evaluation, significant deductions are warranted for multiple differences from the ground truth:
- **Structural/formatting errors** (-2.0): Lacks formal memo header (To/From/Subject), bolding for activities, and reference to total cases (~4,805, derivable from table data). Ground truth uses these for executive polish.
- **Content omissions/inaccuracies** (-1.0): Does not explicitly state "average throughput" values (e.g., "900 s vs. 600 s SLA") for clarity, unlike ground truth; introduces "end-to-end loan processing" phrasing assuming context not explicitly in table/prompt.
- **Recommendation differences** (-0.5): Actions are concrete and tied to data but differ substantially in specifics and creativity (e.g., LLM's generic "expand staffing" vs. ground truth's "add one risk analyst to peak morning"; no matching elements like "bypass" or "â‚¬25k heuristic"), reducing alignment.
- **Minor phrasing/closing variances** (-0.0, neutral): Closing benefit statement is present but less precise (no "35% reduction" projection); order of activities differs slightly.

These accumulate to a mid-range score, as core analysis matches but presentation and recommendation fidelity do not, per strict criteria where even small divergences (e.g., missing throughput labels) incur notable point loss.
