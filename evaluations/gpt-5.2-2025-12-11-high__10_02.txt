**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Structural Mismatches (Critical Failure, -3.0)**: LLM has 3 role columns (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support); Ground Truth (GT) has 4 (adds Operations Manager). LLM invents 8 tasks (splits source steps 5-6 into extras like "Ensure SWIFT", "Notify"); GT precisely maps to 6 tasks without extras/omissions.
- **Task Wording Violations (Major, -2.0)**: LLM uses non-mandated phrasings (e.g., "Receive transfer instruction and log it", "Perform **KYC Review** on sender and beneficiary"); GT enforces concise, mandated-style titles (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "**KYC Review**"). Fails "mandated wording" note.
- **RACI Assignments (Total Mismatch, -2.5)**: Every row differs significantly (e.g., KYC Review: LLM "C | **R/A** | I" vs. GT "C | **R** | **A** | I"; Receive: LLM "**R/A** | I | I" vs. GT "**R** | I | **A** | C"). LLM improperly combines **R/A** in cells; GT separates clearly. No accountability consistency.
- **Missing Elements (Minor but Penalized, -0.5)**: No "Legend"; no adherence notes. Bold formatting inconsistent with GT.
- **Partial Credits (+1.0)**: Uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") in places; Markdown table format.

Total differences are pervasive; LLM fails to replicate GT's exact mapping, vocabulary enforcement, and RACI logic. Unusable as equivalent documentation.
