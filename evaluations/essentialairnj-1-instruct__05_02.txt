The LLM answer fails catastrophically: it selects the wrong task (`Task_GrantAccess` instead of `Task_CollectEquipment`), applies the opposite change (loosens `P1D` to `P7D` worsening SLA breaches instead of tightening `P5D` to `P2D`), provides invalid unified diff format (no `@@` hunk header, malformed `-`/`+` lines, incorrect ` ```python` wrapper), and a nonsensical rationale that contradicts SLA improvement goals.
