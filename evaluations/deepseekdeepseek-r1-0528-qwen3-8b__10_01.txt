2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Policy Adherence (Positive, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere, even in explanations or notes. This is flawless and aligns perfectly with the strict policy.
  
- **Structure and Format (Partial, +0.5 points)**: The response produces a RACI matrix with activities as rows and roles as columns, using the four specified roles (AM, CO, FC, IT). No extra tasks, roles, or columns are added, meeting the "unwarranted content" criterion. However, deductions for:
  - Inconsistent/inaccurate activity naming: "Application Receipt" (vs. ground truth's "Receive Application"); inconsistent bolding (e.g., only some activities bolded, unlike ground truth).
  - Header differences: Includes an extraneous title row ("RACI Matrix: Order-to-Cash Workflow") and uses abbreviations like "(AM)" in headers, which the ground truth avoids.
  - Blanks in cells (interpreted as no role) instead of explicit I/C where required, disrupting completeness.
  - Unwarranted explanatory text in cells (e.g., "(Initiates further steps)"), which adds non-essential content not present in the ground truth.

- **RACI Allocations Correctness (Major Failure, -4.0 points total, strict penalty for errors)**: The narrative requires RACI to reflect the process description (one Responsible per activity; Accountable for AM where leading). The LLM answer fails significantly here, with multiple mismatches per activity, violating the "reflect the narrative" rule. Strict evaluation treats each discrepancy as a major error:
  - **Receive Application**: AM A/R matches R/A intent (minor order difference, acceptable). CO C correct. But FC/IT blank (vs. I/I) → incomplete (-0.5).
  - **KYC Review**: AM C (vs. A) wrong; CO A/R (vs. R, extra A unwarranted); FC blank (vs. C); IT blank (vs. I) → fully mismatched (-1.0).
  - **Order Vetting**: AM A/R matches R/A. But CO blank (vs. C); FC/IT blank (vs. I/I) → incomplete (-0.5).
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM C (vs. A) wrong; CO blank (vs. C); FC A/R (vs. R, extra A); IT blank (vs. I) → mismatched (-1.0).
  - **Record Update**: AM C correct; IT A/R matches R (extra A minor). But CO C (vs. I) wrong; FC blank (vs. C) → mismatched (-0.5).
  - **Notify Customer**: AM A/R matches R/A. But CO/FC/IT blank (vs. I/I/I) → incomplete (-0.5).
  - Overall: No activity is fully accurate; many lack one Responsible/Accountable or omit Consulted/Informed roles. Each activity should have exactly one R, but extras (e.g., unwarranted A) and omissions break this. Cumulative errors indicate poor reflection of the process narrative.

- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Base score starts high for vocabulary/structure but plummets due to RACI inaccuracies (core of the task). Small errors (e.g., blanks, extra text, naming) incur significant penalties per instructions, resulting in a low score. The answer is functional but not faithful to the ground truth, with ~60% mismatch in allocations.
