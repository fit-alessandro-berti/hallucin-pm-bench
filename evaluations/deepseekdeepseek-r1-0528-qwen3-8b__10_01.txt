6.0

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The answer generally follows the vocabulary policy: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" are all used with correct spelling/capitalization, and none of the forbidden terms appear anywhere.
- No unwarranted roles, activities, or columns are introduced.

**Major Errors:**
- **Activity Names:**
  - The ground truth lists "Receive Application," but the LLM answer changes it to "Application Receipt," which breaks strict adherence to terminology.
  - “Record Update” and "Notify Customer" in the LLM answer are kept, which matches ground truth.
- **RACI Allocations:**
  - There are substantial mismatches in the RACI allocations for almost every row:
    - For "Receive Application," ground truth says AM is "R/A" (Responsible/Accountable), CO is "C" (Consulted), FC and IT are "I" (Informed). The LLM shows "A/R" and adds editorial notes ("Initiates further steps"), omits FC and IT, conflates or confuses the RACI roles.
    - The LLM uses "**A/R**" to indicate both Accountable and Responsible for some rows, but the convention from ground truth is "R / A". Also, the ground truth assigns only Responsible or Accountable per activity, with correct secondaries; the LLM gives more ambiguous responsibilities and often mixes notes within cells, providing process commentary rather than sticking to R, A, C, I marks only.
    - For "KYC Review," ground truth says CO is "R", but LLM puts "**A/R**". Similarly, in "Order Vetting," LLM uses "**A/R**" for AM, but ground truth specifies "R/A". For "Payment Clearance," in ground truth, FC is "R", while in the LLM answer, FC is "A/R". Several other mismatches exist in who is Consulted or Informed, or roles omitted entirely.
  - The LLM frequently provides commentary in parentheses inside matrix cells (e.g., "**C** (Waits for documents post-receipt)"), which is outside typical RACI matrix structure and was not in ground truth.
- **RACI Axis Order/Completeness:**
  - The LLM sometimes omits or fails to indicate the "Informed" status, especially for FC and IT, seen in the ground truth.

**Smaller Issues:**
- The LLM sometimes uses “A/R,” sometimes separate “A” and “R” (ground truth uses "R / A" where both apply).
- The headings for activities are not consistently matched to the ground truth (e.g., "Application Receipt" vs. "Receive Application").

**Overall:**
- No forbidden terminology and the required terms used = maintains minimum acceptability.
- Multiple allocation errors and incorrect/ambiguous notation, extra commentary, and inconsistent activity names = notable loss of points. Every incorrect Responsible or Accountable is a serious process documentation flaw.
- Prompt asked for utmost strictness, so such deviations warrant a low, though passing, score.

**Thus, 6.0 is justified.**
