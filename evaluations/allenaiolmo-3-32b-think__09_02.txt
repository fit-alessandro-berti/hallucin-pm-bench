The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt with a single explanatory sentence, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps as the key issue. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences from the ground truth (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "timestamps for individual events" vs. explicit "start-to-completion intervals are absent"), which are semantically equivalent but not identical under utmost strictness.
