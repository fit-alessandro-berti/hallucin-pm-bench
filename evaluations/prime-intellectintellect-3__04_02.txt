**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **R1**: Status match (Compliant), justification equivalent (minor phrasing diffs, e.g., "€10k" vs "€10 000"). Full credit.
- **R2**: Status mismatch (Compliant vs **Violated**), justification incorrect (ignores change-triggered new approval on 07-Mar as "last required approval"; Ship_Goods on 05-Mar precedes it, violating "after" and 2-day window). Zero credit – major error.
- **R3**: Status and justification match. Full credit.
- **R4**: Status and justification equivalent. Full credit.
- **R5**: Status match (Violated), but justification incomplete (misses Pay_Invoice and Receive_Goods as further steps before new approval; focuses only on Ship_Goods). Partial credit (80%).
- **R6**: Status and justification match. Full credit.
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT). Full credit.
- **Format**: Close to prompt (bold rule/status, ≤20-word justifs), minor diffs from ground-truth table irrelevant.
- **Strict scoring**: 5/6 rules fully/partially correct statuses (weighted avg ~83%), but R2 total failure + R5 imprecision deduct heavily (-50% penalty for core compliance misanalysis). No extra credit for overall.
