7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately pinpoints violations of Rules 2 and 3 with appropriate citations to events, matching the ground truth's violated rules. However, it incurs deductions for: (1) incompleteness, as it omits verification of Rules 1, 4, and 5 (which the ground truth confirms as satisfied, providing a fuller justification); (2) a factual error in Rule 3, stating "distance of 4" instead of the ground truth's "distance = 3" (a small but strict violation of calculation precision, leading to significant point loss per instructions); and (3) slightly less structured formatting compared to the ground truth's exhaustive, numbered per-rule breakdown. These differences reduce alignment, though the core reasoning on violations remains sound.
