7.0

The LLM answer lists all and only the correct functional differences compared to the ground truth, but it does not fully conform to the required output format:

- Headings: The LLM answer uses hyphens before each heading, not matching the verbatim, bold, and ordering requirement.
- Task listing: Uses inline, not bullet points as in ground truth.
- Gateway listing: Lacks proper alignment, spacing, and bullet points (ground truth uses spaces after the colon and aligns arrows).
- No extra commentary or errors otherwise.

These format deviations, while seemingly minor, occur for every heading and list, so significant point deduction is warranted given the strict grading asked. Content is fully correct, but because instructed to be strict also on small errors, 7.0 is assigned.
