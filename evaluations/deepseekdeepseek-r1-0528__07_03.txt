The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway types) with precise IDs, names, and type transitions, matching the ground truth content verbatim. However, it deviates in formatting: unnecessary dashes (-) precede each heading (absent in ground truth), items under headings lack the bullet points (-) used in ground truth, and there is no alignment spacing in the second gateway entry (e.g., "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel"). These minor structural differences, while not affecting substance, warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria for not fully replicating the ground truth presentation.
