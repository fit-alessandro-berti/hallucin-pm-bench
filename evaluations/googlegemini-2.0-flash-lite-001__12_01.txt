The LLM answer correctly identifies that the fact is inaccurate and cites relevant cases (1001 and 1003) where "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund." This matches the evidence and directly contradicts the claim. However, significant shortcomings include:

- The answer omits explicit mention of **Case 1002**, where "Update_Inventory" does not appear at allâ€”a critical counterexample, since the claim requires the sequence to always occur.
- The justification is limited; it does not explicitly discuss the "immediately before" aspect, nor does it note the lack of sequence in any case.
- The answer lacks line references and does not thoroughly negate the "always" component of the claim with full evidence.

Due to these omissions and lack of exhaustive, explicit justification (as shown in the ground truth), a strict evaluation mandates significant point deduction. The answer is directionally correct, but notably incomplete and less rigorous than expected for this type of analysis.
