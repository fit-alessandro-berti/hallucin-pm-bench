9.0

- The LLM answer is essentially correct for all three questions.  
- **A1:** The enumeration of case IDs redundantly lists the case names, but the count (3) is correct and corresponds to the ground truth. Small verbosity loss (-0.5).
- **A2:** The answer is correct and unambiguous: "Pack_Items".
- **A3:** The answer is accurate: "Cancel_Order".

The only minor error is mildly verbose wording versus the extremely concise ground truth, so small deduction for that. Otherwise, it matches ground truth exactly in fact and order.
