The LLM answer is highly accurate and correct on all factual points, closely matching the ground truth in content (distinct cases, preceding activity, and unique activity). Minor deductions for slight verbosity in answers 2 and 3 (adding explanatory phrases beyond the concise name-only format of the ground truth) and the addition of "distinct" in answer 1, which is not in the ground truthâ€”per strict evaluation, these small format deviations warrant a small point loss despite overall strong alignment with the prompt's conciseness requirement.
