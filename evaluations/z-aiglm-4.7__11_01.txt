### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Strengths (full points):**
- **Correctness (10/10):** Activities ranked correctly (#1 Request_Documents 36.5/120.0h, #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0h, #3 Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4h). Numbers quoted verbatim from table. No service-time, throughput, or extra activities mentioned.
- **No unwarranted content (10/10):** Strictly limited to required elements.
- **Format/Conciseness (9.5/10):** Professional memo structure (TO/FROM/RE), crisp, <150 words (est. 85 words).

**Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness):**
- **Action relevance & requirements (-1.5 total):** Actions are concrete/logical (SMS reminders tied to customer delays; automation to queues; routing to workloads) but:
  - Fail to **explicitly promise ≥20% cut** per prompt (e.g., no "≥20% reduction," "pilot shows 25%," or estimates). Ground truth includes this verbatim.
  - Marginally "data-driven" (concrete but no cited evidence/pilots/estimates like ground truth; feels assumptive).
- **Differences from ground truth (-0.3):** Wording/structure diverges (e.g., "Stats:" vs "#1 – avg/p95"; action details differ: "SMS reminders" vs "24h escalation/pilot"; "algorithm routing" vs "rules-engine pre-classification"). Not identical, per strict diff-based grading.

**Overall:** Near-perfect compliance but misses explicit ≥20%/data-backing phrasing (key prompt element), warranting deduction. Small format/wording diffs compound under utmost strictness.
