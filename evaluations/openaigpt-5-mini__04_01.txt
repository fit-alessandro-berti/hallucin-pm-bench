The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and accurately assesses all five rules with precise event references and rule citations, matching the ground truth's conclusions verbatim in substance. Violations for Rules 2 and 3 are explained equivalently, and satisfactions for Rules 1, 4, and 5 are factually identical. Minor deductions for structural differences (non-sequential rule ordering in numbering, starting with violations instead of Rule 1, lack of bold formatting, absence of a concluding summary sentence, and slightly varied phrasing such as "positions +1 or +2" vs. "next two activities... distance = 3") prevent a perfect score under strict evaluation criteria.
