The numeric responses (1, 2a, 2b) are exact matches to the ground truth, with correct calculations and rounding. The explanation for question 3 is concise (87 words), addresses low support's risks to representativeness and reliability, covers variance/instability implicitly via "skew results" and "difficult to draw reliable conclusions," and explicitly cautions against over-generalization. However, it deducts minor points for not explicitly referencing the "single occurrence" (e.g., "only once" or "single observation") as required, opting for more general phrasing like "limited occurrence," which slightly weakens precision despite contextual awareness from question 2.
