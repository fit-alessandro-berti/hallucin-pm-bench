**9.5**

- **1.** Correctly states “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs **1** time.
- **2a.** Correct arithmetic: (1/48)*100 = **2.08%**
- **2b.** Correct: (1/12)*100 = **8.33%**
- **3.** The explanation is accurate and clear, acknowledges rarity and risk for generalization, and explicitly discusses misleading analysis and flawed conclusions; however, while it cautions against overgeneralizing from the single observation and implies instability (“may not be representative”, “its rarity can skew results”), it doesn’t explicitly mention statistical variance/instability or that statistics rest on just one observation.

**Deduction:**  
- Small point off (0.5) for not explicitly explaining that metrics (like mean/estimates) on this activity are statistically unstable due to single-case support.

**Final score: 9.5**  
(Nearly perfect; lacks just a bit of statistical nuance required by the rubric.)
