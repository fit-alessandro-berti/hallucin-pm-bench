The LLM answer captures all actual changes—tasks added and removed, gateway type changes—with correct ids and names/types. However, it introduces two formatting errors relative to the ground truth:

1. Unwarranted addition of headings ("# BPMN Change Analysis", "##") in Markdown style, instead of just the plain headlines as required (“ADDED TASKS”, etc).
2. Additional whitespace in the "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" section: in the ground truth, the second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment") aligns the colons for visual clarity (“Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel”), whereas the LLM uses only one space.

These deviations, though minor, count as strict errors—especially the heading/formatting one—which, according to the instructions, must result in significant loss of points despite all factual content being correct.
