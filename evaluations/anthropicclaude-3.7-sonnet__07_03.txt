The LLM answer is functionally correct in identifying all added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer), the removed task (Task_ManualReview), and the gateway changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment both from exclusive to parallel). However, it includes an unauthorized title "# BPMN Change Analysis," uses Markdown formatting (##) for headings instead of plain text as in the ground truth, and lacks the alignment spaces in the second gateway entry ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive â†’ parallel"). These formatting deviations and extraneous content violate the strict instruction to output only the three required headings and concrete differences verbatim, resulting in a deduction despite the accurate content.
