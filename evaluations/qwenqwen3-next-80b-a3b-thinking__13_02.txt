The LLM answer precisely matches the ground truth on questions 1 and 2 (exact counts and percentages with calculations). For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit, explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue (i), highlights instability/variance via lack of significance, unreliability, and overfitting risks (ii), and cautions against over-generalization through inflated importance, inaccurate models, and flawed predictions/decisions (iii). No deviations or inventions from the log; content is on-topic and substantive without minor flaws.
