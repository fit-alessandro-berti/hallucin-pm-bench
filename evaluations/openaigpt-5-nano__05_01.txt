The LLM answer captures the general concept of an interrupting boundary timer to enforce the 48-hour SLA by bypassing to Task_Triage, includes a solid explanation of how/why it avoids duplicates, and references relevant IDs. However, it incorrectly attaches the timer to Task_Check (which starts the clock too late, after Task_Receive, potentially violating the "from submission" timing) instead of Task_Receive as in the ground truth. It also omits the timer's ID, BPMN duration notation (PT48H), and explicit bypassing of document requests. These are significant errors in precision and fidelity to the ground truth, warranting a substantial deduction despite the shared structure.
