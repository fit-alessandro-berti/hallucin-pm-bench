The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning in a single concise sentence. However, it deducts a minor point for lacking the ground truth's explicit mention of event counts and the specific need for start-to-completion intervals, which adds precision without introducing error.
