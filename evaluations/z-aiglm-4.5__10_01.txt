2.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Compliance (Positive, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere, including in rationale or notes. This fully adheres to the vocabulary policy.
  
- **RACI Matrix Structure and Format (Partial, +0.5 points)**: The matrix includes all required activities as rows and roles as columns (AM, CO, FC, IT). It uses standard RACI labels (A, R, C, I). However, it leaves many cells blank (implying no involvement), which contradicts the ground truth's explicit assignments (e.g., no blanks; all cells filled with I, C, or nothing only if truly uninvolved). Notation varies (e.g., "A, R" vs. ground truth's "**R / A**"), and bolding for primaries is absent. Minor deductions for incomplete table representation.

- **RACI Assignments Correctness (Major Failure, -8.0 points)**: This is the core of the prompt, and differences are extensive, violating the process narrative and ground truth. Strict evaluation per row:
  - **Receive Application**: LLM (AM: A,R; others blank) vs. Ground (AM: R/A; CO: C; FC: I; IT: I). Misses CO: C and FC/IT: I; incorrectly implies no involvement for others.
  - **KYC Review**: LLM (AM: I; CO: A,R; others blank) vs. Ground (AM: A; CO: R; FC: C; IT: I). Wrong: CO should be R only (not A); AM is A (not I); misses FC: C and IT: I. Contradicts process (CO performs it, implying AM accountable as process owner).
  - **Order Vetting**: LLM (AM: A,R; others blank) vs. Ground (AM: R/A; CO: C; FC: I; IT: I). Misses CO: C and FC/IT: I.
  - **Payment Clearance**: LLM (AM: I; FC: A,R; others blank) vs. Ground (AM: A; CO: C; FC: R; IT: I). Wrong: FC should be R only (not A); AM is A (not I); misses CO: C and IT: I. Ignores process (FC initiates).
  - **Record Update**: LLM (AM: A; FC: I; IT: R; CO blank) vs. Ground (AM: C; CO: I; FC: C; IT: R). Wrong: AM is C (not A); FC is C (not I); misses CO: I. Contradicts process (IT refreshes CRM, implying supportive roles only).
  - **Notify Customer**: LLM (AM: A,R; others blank) vs. Ground (AM: R/A; CO: I; FC: I; IT: I). Misses CO/FC/IT: I.
  - Overall: Fails "exactly one Responsible per activity" in several rows (e.g., KYC combines A/R on CO). Accountabilities misaligned (e.g., AM not always A where narrative implies ownership). Each mismatch is a significant error per strict rubric, reflecting poor adherence to process roles (AM for 1,3,6; CO for 2; FC for 4; IT for 5).

- **Unwarranted Content (Penalty, -1.5 points)**: The prompt requests only a "RACI matrix (activities as rows, roles as columns)". LLM adds excessive extras: full rationale section (inventing justifications like "AM owns CRM data integrity" not in process), key legend (redundant), and "Compliance Notes" (self-congratulatory, confirming terminology but unnecessary). Ground truth rubric explicitly penalizes "no extra tasks, roles, or columns" and implies minimal output. This introduces bloat and potential bias (e.g., rationale justifies errors).

- **Overall Alignment to Narrative and Best Practices (Failure, -2.0 points)**: Assignments do not "reflect the narrative" (process description assigns primary handlers: AM for Receive/Order Vetting/Notify; CO for KYC; FC for Payment; IT for Record). No single A per activity in all cases. Lacks ground truth's emphasis on AM accountability where appropriate. Blanks undermine completeness.

**Total Score Justification**: Starting from 10.0 maximum, deductions total -8.0 for core RACI errors (primary failure, multiple per row), with minor credits only for terminology and basic structure. Utmost strictness applied: even partial mismatches (e.g., combined A/R where separated) cause outsized penalties, as they deviate from ground truth's precise allocations. This is not a faithful reproduction but a flawed reinterpretation.
