8.2

**Evaluation:**

**Terminology adherence:**  
- The LLM answer correctly uses the required synonyms: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance."  
- Forbidden terms are not mentioned.

**Structure:**  
- All six activities and four roles are present and correctly aligned in the table as in the ground truth.

**RACI Allocations:**  
There are notable differences from the ground truth, particularly with how RACI roles are assigned for each activity (significant per your strictness requirements):

1. **Receive Application:**  
    - LLM: AM (A, R); others blank.  
    - GT: AM (R/A); CO (C); FC (I); IT (I).  
    - **Issue:** LLM omits Consultation/Informed designations for CO, FC, and IT. 

2. **KYC Review:**  
    - LLM: AM (I); CO (A, R); others blank.  
    - GT: AM (A); CO (R); FC (C); IT (I).  
    - **Issue:** Missing C and I assignments; GT splits A/R between AM/CO, but LLM assigns both to CO and only I to AM.

3. **Order Vetting:**  
    - LLM: AM (A, R); others blank.  
    - GT: AM (R/A); CO (C); FC (I); IT (I).  
    - **Issue:** LLM omits C and I roles.

4. **Payment Clearance:**  
    - LLM: FC (A, R); AM (I).  
    - GT: AM (A); CO (C); FC (R); IT (I).  
    - **Issue:** LLM: No C or I for others; A assigned solely to FC instead of AM.

5. **Record Update:**  
    - LLM: AM (A); FC (I); IT (R).  
    - GT: AM (C); CO (I); FC (C); IT (R).  
    - **Issue:** AM role is C in GT but A in LLM; missing several C/I assignments.

6. **Notify Customer:**  
    - LLM: AM (A, R); others blank.  
    - GT: AM (R/A); CO (I); FC (I); IT (I).  
    - **Issue:** Exceptionally underpopulated; omits I for other roles.

**Key and rationale:**  
- The LLM answer provides a correct explanation of RACI roles, and some rationale per activity.  
- It explicitly states compliance with vocabulary policy.

**Summary:**  
- **Strengths:** Terminology policy perfectly observed; no forbidden terms; all roles and activities present.
- **Weaknesses:** Widespread under-specification of "Consulted" (C) and "Informed" (I) rolesâ€”almost always omitted for non-primary actors; Accountable (A) role not always consistent with GT, and at times both A and R assigned together counter to the GT's division.
- **Conclusion:**  
  - **Very strong on terminology and absence of forbidden language.**  
  - **Structurally correct.**  
  - **Deficient RACI allocation relative to the ground truth.**  
  - *Per strictness requirements, these role-assignment errors are significant and reflect in a significant but not catastrophic deduction.*

**Final Score:** **8.2**
