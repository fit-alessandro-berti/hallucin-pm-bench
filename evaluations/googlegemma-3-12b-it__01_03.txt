5.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
I evaluated the LLM answer strictly against the prompt and ground truth, focusing on accuracy, completeness, and fidelity to the process description. Differences, even minor ones, result in point deductions as per the instructions. The score reflects strong performance on part (a) but critical failures in part (b), with an overall average tempered by strictness.

#### Part (a): Decision Points (Weight: ~50%)
- **Strengths**: Correctly identifies the two decision points. The TriVote rule is accurately summarized ("any two out of the three" matches the process's "any two approvals out of three suffice to pass"). Descriptions are concise and one sentence each, as required.
- **Errors/Deductions**:
  - First decision point: The summary omits the explicit "otherwise" outcome (proceeding to Manual-Underwriting-Review if conditions are not met), which the ground truth includes for completeness. This makes it incomplete (-1.0 point).
  - Minor phrasing: Uses "€250,000 or less" (comma in number) vs. ground truth's "≤ €250 000" (no comma, symbolic inequality); trivial but deducted under strictness (-0.2 point).
- **Sub-score**: 8.0/10 (good but incomplete).

#### Part (b): Documents List (Weight: ~50%)
- **Strengths**: Correctly lists most documents (Form 14B, three Scorecards, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025) in the proper early order. No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML items).
- **Errors/Deductions**:
  - **Major omission**: Fails to include "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document, which first appears in step 8 (Request-Applicant-Confirmation). The process explicitly lists it separately from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7, and the ground truth treats it as such (item 7). This violates "list ALL documents" and results in an incomplete inventory (-3.0 points; significant loss for missing a required item).
  - **Order error**: Places "ID Matrix Declaration" as item 7 (after Offer Sheet 77), but both it and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" first appear together in step 8. Ground truth sequences Signed Offer Sheet 77 before ID Matrix Declaration based on their listing order in the process ("Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration"). This disrupts the "first-appearance order" (-1.0 point).
  - Total items: LLM lists 8, but ground truth has 9; this undercounts due to the omission.
- **Sub-score**: 3.0/10 (incomplete and disordered, major flaws despite partial accuracy).

#### Overall Considerations
- Extra content (introductory "Okay, here's a breakdown" and closing "Let me know...") is unnecessary but not deductable as it doesn't contradict the prompt.
- No evidence of ignoring process notes (e.g., no KYC mentions).
- Strict adjustment: The omission in (b) is a core failure (missing an explicitly named document), warranting disproportionate penalty. Total score averages sub-scores with emphasis on completeness: (8.0 + 3.0)/2 = 5.5.
