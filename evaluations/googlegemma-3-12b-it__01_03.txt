6.5

- For (a), both main decision points are identified and summarized correctly, with no critical omissions. However, some of the wording is less precise than in the ground truth. For example, LLM says, "the loan proceeds to the next stage if it receives approval from any two out of three," rather than explicitly stating "at least two of three." Minor imprecision, but the intended meaning matches.
- For (b), the LLM omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" from its list of required documents, instead listing "Offer Sheet 77" only once (as prepared, not signed/returned), even though the confirmation step specifically requests "Signed Offer Sheet 77" in addition to "ID Matrix Declaration." This is a clear, concrete omission and penalizes the answer significantly.
- Otherwise, document order and presence match exactly, except for this omission.
- No invented steps or hallucinated documents are present.

Given the very strict standard and that even small omissions or imprecision must result in substantial deductions, the missing "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (a unique, process-required document) is significant—resulting in roughly a 2.5–3 point deduction. The remaining content is clear and shows close reading of the process, so the score is above average but not much higher than that.
