The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks in the specified order, adhering closely to the prompt's instruction to list them without extraneous details about other processes. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for minor formatting deviations from the ground truth (e.g., using curly braces and simple comma separation instead of backticks, bold labels, descriptive "parallel block" phrasing, and the â€– symbol; omitting the explicit confirmation that no other tasks run in parallel). These stylistic differences, while not altering the core content, represent small but noticeable mismatches warranting a deduction.
