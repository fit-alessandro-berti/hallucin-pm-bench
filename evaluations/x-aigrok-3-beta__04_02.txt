7.0

- R1: Correct (Compliant, justification matches ground truth).
- R2: Incorrect (LLM says Compliant, but should be Violated; justification shows misunderstanding of the reference point for "last required approval"â€”misses the post-change-approval requirement).
- R3: Correct (Violated for Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods).
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable, hazardous = false).
- R5: Correct (Violated, correctly identifies that further processing (Ship_Goods, Pay_Invoice) happened before new Manager_Approval).
- R6: Correct (Compliant).

Overall result is correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but the error on R2 is important because it reflects misunderstanding and a critical compliance evaluation failure. As per strictness, this sizable mistake is significant. Some minor wording/formatting differences exist, but main issue is R2.

Minus 3 points for R2 error and -0.5 for slight brevity and format deviation: **7.0**
