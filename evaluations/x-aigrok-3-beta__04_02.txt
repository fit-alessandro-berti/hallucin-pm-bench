### Evaluation Reasoning:
The LLM answer follows the required format closely (status + â‰¤20-word justification per rule, overall result in all-caps), and correctly identifies the overall as NON-COMPLIANT. R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6 statuses match the ground truth, with justifications that are accurate, concise, and under 20 words (minor phrasing differences in R5 do not alter correctness, as it correctly identifies the violation timing with Ship_Goods). However, R2 is a major error: the LLM incorrectly deems it Compliant by referencing only the initial Finance_Approval, ignoring the Change_Request's impact on requiring a new (final) Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07, which makes Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) non-compliant with the 2-day rule post-last approval. This misinterpretation of rule interplay (R2 with R5) warrants a significant deduction under strict criteria. No other format or minor issues (e.g., bolding, table vs. bullets) affect scoring beyond this.
