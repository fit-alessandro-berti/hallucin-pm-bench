7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Perfect match—correctly identifies exactly 1 occurrence, aligning precisely with the ground truth and log data. No errors. (Full points.)
- **Question 2**: Solid structure and word limit compliance (92 words ≤120). Correctly identifies small sample risks and unrepresentativeness, with valid points on anomalies and temporal trends. However, strict deductions for: (1) unidirectional bias toward "overestimate" (ignores bidirectional swinging from 0% to 7% as in ground truth); (2) omission of key statistical concepts like wide confidence intervals and extreme sampling error for rare events; (3) missing nuance on string matching pitfalls (e.g., synonyms like "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. fuzzy risks); (4) minor speculation on trends beyond strict data (e.g., "spike only briefly"). These are significant gaps in depth and precision, reducing score. (Partial credit: ~5/10 for Q2.)

Overall, strong on facts but weaker on analytical rigor compared to ground truth—hence 7.5 total.
