10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and aligns precisely with the ground truth. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match the calculations, rounding, and percentages (2.08% and 8.33%) without deviation. Question 3 is within 100 words (79 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue, highlights variance/instability (e.g., dominated by one point, skewing metrics, outlier effects), and cautions against over-generalisation (e.g., under-estimation in broader analyses). No errors or omissions.
