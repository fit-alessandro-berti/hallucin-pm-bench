**9.8**

- **1. Count of “Manual_Fraud_Check”:** Correct (“once”).
- **2a. Percentage of events:** Correct calculation and correct rounded percentage (“2.08 %”).
- **2b. Percentage of unique cases:** Correct calculation and rounding (“8.33 %”).
- **3. Explanation:** The response (a) cites the single-instance issue, (b) notes domination of statistics by a single observation (variance/instability), and (c) describes risk of misestimation/generalization. The caution in the answer aligns with requirements. The only minor shortcoming is, relative to the model answer, not mentioning “confidence intervals remain wide” or “conclusions are unreliable” directly—but “outlier/hidden effect/under-estimation/risk” sufficiently convey caution.

**Minimal points are deducted (0.2) for not using the precise language/wording of the ground truth, but all substantive points and calculations are correct.**
