4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Correct (3/3 cases identified). No deduction.
- **Q2**: Incorrect ("Validate_Order" instead of "Pack_Items"). This is a major error in sequence reconstruction for case A-9321, as the log shows Pack_Items directly before Ship_Order. Full deduction for this question.
- **Q3**: Correct (earliest timestamp matches). No deduction.
- **Q4**: Correct (2 occurrences of Quality_Check). No deduction.
- **Q5**: Major errors (list includes "Receive_Order," which *does* start cases A-9321 and B-1045; omits "Validate_Order" and "Ship_Order," which never start cases; only "Pack_Items" is incidentally correct). This is substantially incomplete and inaccurate, missing the full set of non-starting activities. Significant deduction.

Overall: 3/5 questions fully correct, but errors in Q2 and Q5 are substantive (sequence misinterpretation and incomplete/wrong enumeration), warranting a low score under strict criteria.
