3.5

The LLM answer has the following scoring breakdown:

- Q1: Correct (**no deduction**)
- Q2: Incorrect (answered "Validate_Order" instead of the correct "Pack_Items"; **major deduction**)
- Q3: Correct (**no deduction**)
- Q4: Correct (**no deduction**)
- Q5: Incorrect (misses "Validate_Order" and "Ship_Order"; incorrectly includes "Receive_Order", which is a start event; **major deduction**)

Two major logical errors (Q2, Q5) and two correct answers (Q1, Q3, Q4), but with the strictness requiredâ€”even small errors cause significant point loss. These are not small errors; they are significant.

A justifiably strict score: **3.5/10**
