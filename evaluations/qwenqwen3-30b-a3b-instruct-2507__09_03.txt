9.8

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, precision, and content: both concisely explain the impossibility due to the redacted event log (no rows or timestamps), directly tie this to the inability to compute cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% CI for "Approve Invoice", and avoid any guessing or external assumptions. The only minor differences are stylistic (e.g., LLM explicitly lists the metrics by name; ground truth uses "dispersion" as a shorthand and adds a closing note on needing more data), which do not introduce errors or deviate from the task's requirements. Under strict evaluation, this warrants a near-perfect score.
