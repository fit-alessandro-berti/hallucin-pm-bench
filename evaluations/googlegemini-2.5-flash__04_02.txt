The LLM answer is highly accurate in statuses (all match ground truth) and justifications (all â‰¤20 words, factually correct, with only minor phrasing differences: R2 emphasizes order over explicit timing calculation; R5 includes an additional valid event (Receive_Goods) not in ground truth). Format closely follows prompt, though intro text and lack of table are small deviations. Overall result identical. Deducting 0.8 for these minor variances under strict evaluation.
