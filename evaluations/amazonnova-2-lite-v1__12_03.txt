**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in correctness, completeness, and key details: both correctly answer **No**, perform identical case-by-case analysis citing **C001 (compliant)**, **C002 (❌ Pack_Items intervenes)**, **C003 (compliant)**, and **C004 (❌ Check_Fraud intervenes)**, and conclude the "always" claim fails due to two violations. Differences are purely stylistic (e.g., markdown sections vs. table, added explanatory phrasing/emoji), with no factual errors, omissions, or deviations under strict evaluation.
