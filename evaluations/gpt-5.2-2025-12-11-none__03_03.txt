**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in terms of core process flow (validation loop, warranty decision branch, parallel shipment/pickup, sequential update/close, two end events), correctly using the required gateways (exclusive for completeness and warranty, parallel split/join), wrc_ ID prefix, and verbatim task names (e.g., "validates the claim", "requests missing information", "send rejection notice", "Create shipment order" matching text casing precisely—better than ground truth's title-case changes). XML is valid BPMN 2.0 and self-contained.

**Deductions (utmost strictness, significant loss for errors/extra elements per rubric):**
- **Extra/hallucinated task + flows (-2.0 points)**: Invented `wrc_task_wait_received` ("waits until it is received") and associated flows (`wrc_flow_5`, `wrc_flow_6`). Text mentions "and waits" descriptively within the "requests missing information" step (not bolded/separate activity); prompt forbids inventing beyond stated. Ground truth models implicit wait via loop only (`request_info -> validate`). This adds unnecessary detail, violating "model **only** explicitly mentioned."
- **Extra task for eligibility check (-0.5 points)**: Includes `wrc_task_check_eligibility` ("checks warranty eligibility"), explicit per prompt text/step 3, but ground truth omits (direct `complete_gw -> warranty_gw`), treating gateway as integrated check/decision for minimalism. Counts as structural difference/extra vs. expected minimal.
- **Minor structural/ stylistic diffs (-0.5 points total)**: Verbose IDs (`wrc_task_*`, `wrc_flow_*`) vs. concise (`wrc_*`, `wrc_sf*`); flow conditions (`<conditionExpression>`) vs. flow `name`s ("Yes"/"No"); named parallel GWs vs. unnamed; different element names (e.g., start "customer submits an online warranty claim" vs. "Online warranty claim submitted"; ends "Completed" vs. "Successful end"); extra xmlns attributes/process `name`; no comments/grouping; longer ( ~90 lines vs. 34).

No omissions of required elements/prompt specs. Overall close (correct logic/paths validate identically), but extras and diffs warrant deduction. Equivalent IDs/whitespace/name tweaks alone = 10.0; extras drop to 7.0.
