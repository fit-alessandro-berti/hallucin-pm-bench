4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment):
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Major failure. #1 and #2 correct (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter with verbatim times). #3 **wrong**—Initial_Screening (2.1h avg) vs. true #3 Assess_Liability (7.8h avg). This violates "strictly by waiting-time" ranking, core to prompt. Numbers match the *wrong* activity. (-4.0 points)
- **No unwarranted content**: Compliant—no service-time, throughput, or extra activities. (+1.0)
- **Action relevance**: Actions plausible and claim ≥20% cut, but not truly "data-driven" (e.g., no pilots/estimates like ground truth; vague "target cut"). Tied to wrong #3 activity. Ground truth has precise, supported remedies. (-1.0)
- **Format/conciseness**: Memo-style, <150 words, crisp. Quotes times near-verbatim. (+0.0—no excess credit vs. ground truth's terser format)

**Overall**: Two-thirds correct but critical ranking error demands heavy penalty per strictness rule. Ground truth divergence on #3/activity ranking alone warrants ~60% loss.
