4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **R1**: Correct status and adequate justification (matches ground truth closely). No deduction.
- **R2**: Correct status (Violated), but justification ignores the impact of Change_Request on "last required approval" (should reference 07-Mar approval, not initial 04-Mar). Significant error in reasoning. -1.5 points.
- **R3**: Correct status and justification (exact match). No deduction.
- **R4**: Correct status and justification (matches). No deduction.
- **R5**: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and justification (fails to recognize Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice as "further processing steps" before new approval). Critical error, as it misinterprets the rule entirely. -3.0 points.
- **R6**: Correct status and justification (matches). No deduction.
- **Conclusion**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but LLM undercounts violations (misses R5), slightly undermining accuracy. -1.0 points.
- **Format/Conciseness**: Minor deviations (numbered list vs. table; justifications â‰¤20 words), but compliant overall. -0.5 points.

Total starting from 10.0, deductions lead to 4.0. The R5 error alone warrants major loss due to strict criteria, as it alters compliance analysis fundamentally.
