**Reasoning:**

- **R1:** Correctly marked **Compliant** with correct justification.  
- **R2:** **Violated** is correct, but justification is factually wrong. Ship_Goods (March 5) is NOT more than 2 days after Finance_Approval (March 4), and should consider the new Manager_Approval date per rule. The model failed to notice that after the Change_Request, a new approval is required; thus, the two days should count from the *second* Manager_Approval (March 7).  
- **R3:** **Violated** and correct rationale.  
- **R4:** Correctly **Not Applicable** with correct reasoning.  
- **R5:** Incorrectly **Compliant** (should be **Violated**): The LLM states that Manager_Approval was obtained after the Change_Request, but ignores that Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before the new Manager_Approval, violating the control.  
- **R6:** Correctly **Compliant** with correct justification.

**Summary:**  
- Incorrect on one of the most critical (R5).
- Justification for R2 is conceptually wrong regarding anchor date.
- Other rules correct.
- Overall result is correct.

Major errors in two core control interpretations: severe deduction, heavy weight accorded to process rules.
