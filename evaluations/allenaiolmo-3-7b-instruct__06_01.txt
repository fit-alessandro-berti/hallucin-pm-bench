**5.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B (no extras or omissions, matching the rationale). However, under utmost strictness:

- **Within-pair alphabetical order**: First pair correct (Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines). Second pair reversed (Quality_Check before Create_Documentation; should be Create_Documentation before Quality_Check as C < Q). Major error.
- **Overall list alphabetical order**: List starts with "Procure_Machines..." (P) before the other (should be C first). Major error, as pairs must sort by first task post-internal sorting.
- **Formatting/alignment**: No column alignment (e.g., ground truth pads "Procure_Materials" to match "Create_Documentation" length before "—"); inconsistent spacing. Minor but deducts per strictness rule.
- Total: Core content matches (pairs only), but explicit ordering (emphasized twice in prompt) fails significantly, halving value despite correct identification.
