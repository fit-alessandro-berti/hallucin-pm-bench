7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Partial Match, -1.5 points deduction)**: The LLM correctly identifies the core decisions in triage eligibility, pre-approval, and the high-value branch, aligning with the process description. However, it is incomplete and less precise than the ground truth: it omits explicit branching outcomes (e.g., rejection/return paths for ineligibility or final approval/rejection leading to process end without payment), mislabels the high-value check as "implicit" (it is explicitly defined as a branch), and does not consolidate the approval logic post-pre-approval/auditor review into a clear "final payment approval" decision. The ground truth provides a more comprehensive, outcome-oriented summary in a structured table, making the LLM's version superficial and inferential rather than exhaustive.
  
- **Required Documents (Significant Error, -1.0 point deduction)**: The LLM lists 6 out of 7 defined artefacts accurately, noting the conditional nature of *AuditTrail* (matching ground truth's "catalogue" inclusion). However, it completely omits *RefundConfirmationPDF* (explicitly defined in Step 6 as part of *Issue_Confirmation_Letter*), violating the prompt's mandate to list **all** required documents without introduction or omission. This is a clear factual gap, as the ground truth includes it exhaustively. The LLM's closing note ("No other... exist") exacerbates the error by falsely implying completeness.

Overall, the LLM answer is mostly faithful to the prompt and process but suffers from incompleteness in branching details and a critical omission in documents, warranting a strict mid-range score under utmost scrutiny. No unauthorized additions were introduced, which preserves some credit.
