7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
#### Part (a): Decision Points
- The LLM correctly identifies the two decision points and summarizes them accurately in one sentence each, closely mirroring the ground truth in structure, content, and rule description.
- Minor issues: Phrasing uses "â‰¤ Medium" (redundant, as "Low or Medium" is explicit in the prompt) and "provide their approval" instead of "record 'Approve'", but these are stylistic and do not alter meaning. No hallucinations or omissions.
- Score for (a): 9.5/10 (near-perfect, with negligible deductions for phrasing under strict criteria).

#### Part (b): Documents
- The LLM lists 8 documents in correct first-appearance order up to a point but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document (explicitly mentioned in Step 8's "Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration"), treating the signed version as implied under the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" from Step 7.
- This results in an incomplete list (ground truth has 9 items), and the order implicitly merges the signed variant, which disrupts precision. The scorecards, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77 (unsigned), ID Matrix Declaration, and Loan Dossier 2025 are correctly included without extras or hallucinations.
- Score for (b): 6.0/10 (significant deduction for omission of a explicitly named document, despite overall good coverage; strict policy penalizes incompleteness heavily).

#### Overall
- Strong on (a), but (b)'s key omission and lack of separation for the signed document represent a material deviation from the ground truth, justifying a weighted average score (emphasizing completeness). No violations of process notes (e.g., no KYC hallucinations). Total: 7.5/10.
