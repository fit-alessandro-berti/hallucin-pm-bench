2.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Strong Match)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" as the exact mandated terms with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This aligns perfectly with the policy and ground truth. (+2.5 points)
- **Structure and Content (Partial Match)**: Activities match the six required steps, with no extras introduced (unwarranted content avoided). Headers use abbreviations (e.g., "AM"), while ground truth uses full names— a minor but strict deduct for inconsistency. The matrix format is present, but the LLM adds an explanatory key (not in ground truth), which is slightly unwarranted. (+0.5 points)
- **RACI Allocations (Major Mismatches)**: This is the core failure. The ground truth provides a complete RACI with one Responsible (R) per activity (matching the narrative's single performer), multiple Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles, and Accountable (A) primarily for Account Manager (AM) where appropriate, plus combined R/A notations and bolding for emphasis. The LLM answer is incomplete and inaccurate:
  - Only assigns A or R to one role per activity, omitting all C and I entries (e.g., ground truth has C for CO in Receive Application; LLM has nothing).
  - Inconsistent application: Puts A for AM in Receive Application, Order Vetting, and Notify Customer without corresponding R (ground truth has R/A for AM there). For KYC Review, only R for CO (misses A for AM, C for FC, I for IT).
  - Payment Clearance and Record Update partially align on R (FC and IT), but miss A for AM, C/I elsewhere.
  - No bolding or R/A combinations as in ground truth.
  - Fails "each activity has exactly one Responsible" in ground truth by not assigning R where A is used alone; does not reflect narrative's implied consultations/informations.
  These are significant errors, not small—resulting in a fundamentally different matrix that doesn't fully represent the process roles. (-7.5 points, heavy deduction for strictness on differences)
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, the LLM captures basics (terms, activities) but delivers an oversimplified, incomplete RACI that deviates substantially from the ground truth's detailed allocations. No self-awareness issues apply. Total reflects partial credit for vocabulary/structure, but major loss for core correctness.
