5.5

**Assessment and Rationale:**

**Vocabulary Policy:**
- The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance", and does NOT mention the forbidden variants. **(No point loss)**

**Process Structure:**
- The set and order of activities matches the process steps as requested. **(No point loss)**

**RACI Assignments:**
- The LLM answer does NOT include all necessary R/C/A/I assignments. Specifically:
    - Only marks one letter per cell, and fails to indicate where multiple roles are Responsible/Accountable, or where roles are Informed/Consulted.
    - Ignores the distribution seen in the ground truth, e.g. for almost every task, several roles are Consulted or Informed.
    - Responsibility ("R") and Accountability ("A") are confused: e.g., KYC Review should have Compliance Officer as Responsible, Account Manager as Accountable; LLM fails to assign Accountability (A) at all in most cases.
    - For activities such as Notify Customer and Order Vetting, the ground truth has Account Manager as Responsible/Accountable, with other roles Informed; the LLM only marks A for Account Manager and does not mention others.
    - The answer says "A (Accountable): The role responsible for the activity" in its key. This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding: **Accountable and Responsible are not the same**. This key is incorrect.
- The LLM also omits any C (Consulted) or I (Informed) assignments from the table itself, despite the ground truth having multiple such assignments. **(Major point loss)**

**Formatting:**
- Table is clear, but incomplete according to requirements.

**Unwarranted Content:**
- No unwarranted content.

**Major Errors:**  
- No consulting or informing roles listed in the table.
- Repeated confusion of Responsible and Accountable.
- Incorrect definition in the key.

**Minor Errors:**  
- None.

**Conclusion:**  
- Use of terminology is correct and table/activities/roles are present.
- RACI assignments are seriously incomplete and reveal a misunderstanding of RACI meaning, as well as a failure to encode multiple role assignments or communicate Consulted/Informed roles.
- These errors are major and cost at least 4.5 points off a perfect 10.

**Final Score: 5.5**
