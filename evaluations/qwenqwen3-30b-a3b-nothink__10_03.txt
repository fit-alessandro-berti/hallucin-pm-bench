### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer adheres strictly to the vocabulary policy (using "Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring" exactly, with no leaks of disallowed terms), which is a strong point and avoids total failure. However, under utmost strictness, the following differences from the ground truth result in significant deductions:

- **Table Structure (major error, -2.0 points)**: The LLM uses a non-standard RACI format with separate columns for R/A/C/I (listing roles per cell), while the ground truth uses roles as columns with R/A/C/I notations (or dashes) in cells. This inverts the conventional RACI presentation and obscures direct role-activity mapping, failing to match the expected format implied by covering "every activity and role" efficiently.

- **Activities Covered (moderate error, -1.5 points)**: The LLM correctly identifies the four core mandated activities but introduces an unauthorized addition ("Payment Scheduling") and slight renaming ("Approval (if needed)" vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval"). It also splits "Fund Release" unnecessarily, violating "do not rename, merge, or add activities." The ground truth consolidates scheduling/release into one activity ("Release Funds"), better aligning with the narrative's description of Treasury Ops handling post-approval without separation. This adds extraneous content and doesn't precisely mirror the described process steps.

- **RACI Assignments (major errors, -3.0 points)**: Numerous inaccuracies in responsibilities, especially missing Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles, which are explicitly required to "cover every activity and role described":
  - **Intake Vetting**: Misses Compliance Analyst (C) and Treasury Ops (I); incorrectly omits ground truth's dash for Compliance Officer.
  - **KYC Review & AML Screening** (identical issues, compounded): Assigns only R to Compliance Analyst and A to Compliance Officer, but ground truth has Compliance Analyst as R/A, Compliance Officer as C, and Treasury Ops as I. No involvement for Front-Office Analyst (correctly none, but misses others).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Misses Front-Office Analyst (C) and Treasury Ops (I); partially correct on R/A split but incomplete coverage.
  - **Approval**: Mostly aligns (Compliance Officer R/A, Compliance Analyst C, Front-Office Analyst I), but ground truth explicitly dashes Treasury Ops (implied none, but LLM doesn't address).
  - **Fund Release**: Assigns A incorrectly to Compliance Officer (ground truth has Treasury Ops as A); misses Compliance Analyst (C) and Compliance Officer (C); only partial match on R (Treasury Ops) and I (Front-Office Analyst). The added "Payment Scheduling" duplicates and misassigns elements of this (e.g., unnecessary A to Officer, no Cs).

These mismatches fail to accurately reflect the process narrative's flow (e.g., escalations, notifications, and conditional paths involving all roles). Small errors like missing dashes or incomplete "None" notations compound into systemic incompleteness. Overall, while vocabulary is flawless, the matrix is ~60% divergent in structure and content, warranting a low score for strict fidelity.
