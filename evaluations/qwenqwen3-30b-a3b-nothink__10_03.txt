4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates a moderate understanding but fails strict adherence to both content and format requirements:

**Positives:**
- The four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") are used exclusively as activity names (no synonyms or variations are present).
- The output is a Markdown table as requested.

**Severe issues and errors (justifying significant loss of points):**
1. **Activity/Column Format Error**: The LLM answer incorrectly mixes the activity and RACI matrix formats:
   - The table columns are 'Responsible', 'Accountable', 'Consulted', 'Informed' (roles as values), not role columns with explicit R, A, C, I markers under each, as specified in the ground truth answer.
   - The ground truth expects a table with role columns (Front-Office Analyst, Compliance Analyst, Compliance Officer, Treasury Ops)—the LLM's format is not as requested.

2. **Extra/Non-Compliant Activities**:
   - The LLM creates non-specified activities, e.g., "Approval (if needed)", "Payment Scheduling", and "Fund Release", instead of strictly mapping to only the authorized six activities in the ground truth ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring", "Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds").

3. **Role assignment:** 
   - Assignments of Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed often do not match the ground truth, e.g., the ground truth explicitly marks "R, A" in some activities that are split/different in the LLM answer.
   - Consultation and information flows are inaccurately represented. For example, the LLM lists "None" (should be '—'), and misses several C/I associations.

4. **Minor policy mishaps:**
   - The phrase "if needed" in "Approval (if needed)" implies conditionality not present in the ground truth activities—should be listed as "Compliance Officer Approval" in all cases.
   - Use of "Payment Scheduling" and splitting "Release Funds" activity between scheduling and release is not supported by the source process narrative or ground truth.

5. **Formatting Instructions Breach:**
   - The instructions for not renaming, merging, or adding activities are violated.
   - The instruction to use “R, A” notation is not followed; instead, responsibility/accountability are split, losing semantic clarity required by the ground truth.

**Summary:**  
Due to major table-format, content, and mapping mismatches, as well as some semantic assignment errors and extra/incorrect activities, only a minority of points can be awarded. The use of the correct activity names prevents a failing grade, but because of format, assignment, and activity issues, the answer receives a strict 4.0.
