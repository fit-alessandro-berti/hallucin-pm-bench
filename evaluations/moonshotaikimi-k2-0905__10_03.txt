4.5

The answer shows a good attempt to adhere to the vocabulary policy and cover all required roles and activities, but there are significant errors per the assessment criteria:

**Strictness/Policy Violations**
- The activity names in the LLM answer do use the four required terms **("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring")**, **but** it omits two mandated activity names: it does not have "**Compliance Officer Approval**" nor does it separate "**Release Funds**" correctly; instead, it lists "Approve / Reject" and "Release Funds & Notify." These are unapproved alternate phrasings or merges, violating the process and vocabulary requirements.

**Matrix Content Errors**
- The matrix improperly merges "Approve / Reject" (not allowed: correct is "Compliance Officer Approval").
- The matrix improperly merges "Release Funds & Notify" (instead of "Release Funds").
- The assignment of Responsible/Accountable is not always true to the ground truth: the ground truth uses dual "R, A" on some activities, while the LLM answer always separates "A" and "R". For example:
   - "Intake Vetting" should be "R, A" to Front-Office Analyst, but LLM answer only marks Responsible.
   - "KYC Review" and "AML Screening" should both be "R, A" to Compliance Analyst; LLM gives only Responsible.
   - "Risk Scoring" accountability is to Compliance Officer but LLM gives only "C" not "A".
   - "Release Funds" accountability lies with Treasury Ops, but LLM answer only marks Responsible.

**Other Issues**
- LLM answer inappropriately gives "C" for Compliance Officer in too many rows, even when not specified in ground truth.
- The answer retains some "I" (Informed) designations that are not in the ground truth (e.g., no "I" for Compliance Officer in "Release Funds").
- The LLM answer includes "Notify" in the last activity ("Release Funds & Notify") which is not in the authorized activity list.

**Summary:**  
- Major error in activity naming: two process steps are renamed or merged.
- Incomplete and incorrect role assignments for Responsible and Accountable.
- Some consultation and involvement not matching ground truth.
- Yet, no outright synonym leakage. 
- Markdown table formatting is accurate.

**Thus, the answer is a significant distance from perfect (deduction of at least 5 points), but not a total failure: 4.5/10.**
