**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: LLM correctly states **1** time, matching ground truth and data (only case 1002). No loss.
- **Q2 (strong but imperfect)**: Covers core ideas (tiny sample of 3 cases/1 day → unrepresentative; naming variants like “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)” → matching issues). Concise (<120 words).  
  **Deductions (-1.8 total)**: 
  - Misses precise metrics (14 events, <2 hours, 0%-7% frequency swing per event, wide CI, explicit sampling error for rares) → lacks ground truth's quantitative punch (-1.0).
  - Vague on time/scale ("small slice" vs. "<2 hours"); hypothesizes unshown "additional naming variants for manual checks" (mild speculation) (-0.5).
  - Less nuanced on matching pitfalls (no "fuzzy over-inclusion") (-0.3).  
Strict but fair: high fidelity overall, minor depth/precision gaps.
