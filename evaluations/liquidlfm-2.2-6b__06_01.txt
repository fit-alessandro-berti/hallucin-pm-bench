The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs of parallel tasks from Process B, with proper alphabetical ordering both within pairs (Create_Documentation before Quality_Check; Procure_Machines before Schedule_Machines) and across the list (C-pair before P-pair). No extraneous pairs are included, aligning perfectly with the ground truth content and rationale. However, under utmost strictness, the formatting deviates slightly: the specified format `Task_X  â€”  Task_Y` implies two spaces before and after the em dash, but the LLM uses single spaces; additionally, the second line lacks padding spaces for vertical alignment of the em dashes, as shown in the ground truth. These small but consistent formatting errors warrant a deduction of 1.0 point.
