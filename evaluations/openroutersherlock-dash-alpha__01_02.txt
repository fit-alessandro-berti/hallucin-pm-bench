### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Issues, ~60% of Score Impact)**: The LLM identifies two correct decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with mostly accurate descriptions, including exact terminology like "≤ 2 points" and escalation to "Harmonisation Committee". However, it completely omits the third ground truth decision point (Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA), where the board votes approve or reject), which is a critical gate in the process flow. It also fails to specify positional context (e.g., "after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), adds ungrounded phrasing (e.g., "continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)" and "proceeds to Disburse Funds"), and introduces extraneous introductory text ("These are the explicit gates..."). These omissions and additions represent significant deviations, warranting a severe deduction.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Issues, ~40% of Score Impact)**: The list is complete and uses exact names from the process (no introductions of standard terminology). However, there are small but strict phrasal differences from the ground truth: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)"; "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)". The LLM uses bullets instead of numbering, omits the ground truth's parenthetical note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), and does not match the exact formatting (e.g., no numbering or italicized note). Per strict criteria, these small errors cause notable point loss.

Overall, the response is partially accurate but critically incomplete on decision points, leading to a mid-range score despite strong adherence to terminology elsewhere.
