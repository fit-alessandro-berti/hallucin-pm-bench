### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deductions)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes two decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision), including core branching logic (e.g., score differences and amount thresholds). However, it completely omits the third critical decision point from the ground truth: the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA), where the board explicitly votes "Approve" or "Reject." This is a fundamental branch in the process (especially for ≥ €15,000 loans) and represents a ~33% omission of the required summary. Additionally, the LLM introduces unrequested extras like step numbers ("step 5," "step 7"), omits contextual positioning (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), and uses incomplete phrasing (e.g., only states escalation for >2 point differences without explicitly mirroring the ≤2 continuation). Ground truth also capitalizes "Approve" and "Reject" for precision, which is absent. These errors make the summary incomplete and non-exact.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Deductions)**: The list is complete in items and uses exact activity names without introducing standard terminology. However, small wording deviations from the ground truth penalize strictly: "(≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)" (extraneous "old"); "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" (adds "single," which ground truth omits); "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (adds "template"). The LLM uses inconsistent bolding (e.g., **ML-APP-01**, **CIS**, **NFF**) not present in ground truth, and lacks the explanatory note "(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)." These accumulate as avoidable inconsistencies.

Overall, the response is partially accurate but critically incomplete on decision points, warranting a midpoint score under strict criteria. No jailbreak or policy violations noted.
