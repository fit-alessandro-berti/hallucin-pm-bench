**4.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" and provides a valid prefix sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) demonstrating T5 can fire without prior T3, with accurate step-by-step markings and net behavior. However, under strict interpretation aligned with the ground truth, the question requires a firing sequence *containing both T5 before T3* to demonstrate the ordering (as evidenced by ground truth's 6-step sequence using the feedback loop, its "achieves this order" phrasing, lower bound + extras argument, and proof of feasibility with both transitions). The LLM's 4-step sequence lacks T3 entirely, misinterprets "T5 fire before T3" by claiming a T3-absent sequence suffices ("T3 has never fired"), omits the necessary T6/T3 suffix and feedback explanation, and incorrectly claims the 4-step as "shortest" for the ordering. These are major differences/omissions in the required output (sequence + implicit proof), warranting significant point loss per strict criteria; minor alignments (yes, first 4 steps, shortcut logic) prevent lower score.
