The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to lack of timestamps or duration information. However, it omits the explicit note that only event counts are available (as mentioned in the ground truth) and that the absence of required start-to-completion intervals is the reason, which would better align with the precise wording and completeness of the ground truth. This missing specificity justifies a one-point deduction.
