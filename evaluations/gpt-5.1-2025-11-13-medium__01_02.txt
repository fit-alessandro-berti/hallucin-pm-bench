9.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly faithful to the ground truth in identifying and summarizing the core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) using exact terminology from the prompt, with accurate descriptions of conditions and flows. It correctly places the Amount Threshold after the Neighbourhood Feedback Check and treats the MBA as a binary decision point. Minor deductions (-0.5) for small additions not in the ground truth, such as explicitly stating "proceed directly to NFC" (vs. ground truth's concise "continue"), "> 2 points" phrasing (equivalent but not identical to "else"), and outcome details for MBA approval/rejection (e.g., "proceed to Disburse Funds" and "no disbursement"), which expand beyond the ground truth's brevity without contradicting it.

For required documents, the list is complete and matches all six items exactly in content and order. Phrasing is nearly identical to the prompt's wording (e.g., retaining "≤ 3 months old," "single pay-stub or tax slip," and "(CIS) template"), which introduces slight differences from the ground truth's minor abbreviations (e.g., "≤ 3 months," "pay-stub/tax slip," "(CIS)"). The ground truth's optional parenthetical note on excluded documents is absent, but this is not required by the prompt, so no deduction. Structure uses bullets/dashes (vs. ground truth's numbering), but this is stylistic and does not affect accuracy. Overall, differences are minimal and non-substantive, warranting a near-perfect score under strict evaluation.
