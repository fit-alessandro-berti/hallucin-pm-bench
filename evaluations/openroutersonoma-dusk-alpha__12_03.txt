7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies that the FACT is inaccurate and provides a clear justification based on C002, where an activity intervenes between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment." However, it only cites C002 as a counterexample and overlooks C004, which also violates the FACT (since "Check_Fraud" intervenes there). 

Furthermore, the answer somewhat implies that C003 and C004 both conform, when in fact only C003 does; C004 is another violating instance.

The ground truth answer is more rigorous and comprehensive, showing a case-by-case breakdown, and notes both C002 and C004 as counterexamples, which the LLM should have done.

Because the LLM failed to mention all relevant counterexamples—specifically omitting C004—the answer is incomplete and loses points for that omission. Strict grading applies here per your instruction.
