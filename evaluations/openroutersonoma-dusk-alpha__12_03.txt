7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of core decision (Yes/No)**: The LLM correctly answers "No", aligning with the ground truth. This is the primary task requirement (+2.0 points).
- **Justification accuracy**: The LLM correctly identifies C002 as a counterexample with "Pack_Items" intervening, which is sufficient to falsify the "always" claim (+2.5 points). However, it makes a significant factual error by misclassifying C004: it claims "Validate_Payment" follows immediately after "Receive_Order" in C004, ignoring the intervening "Check_Fraud" activity (10:05:00 → 10:07:00 → 10:20:00). This directly contradicts the log evidence and ground truth (-1.5 points for the error; another -0.5 for not noting it as a second counterexample).
- **Comprehensiveness**: The LLM only analyzes C002 in detail and superficially groups the others (C001, C003, C004) without case-by-case verification, missing the opportunity to fully mirror the ground truth's thorough table-based breakdown (-1.0 point). It relies only on the log as instructed, avoiding external assumptions (+0.5 implicit).
- **Clarity and structure**: The response is concise, well-structured (e.g., bolded sections), and cites timestamps/sequences appropriately, but lacks the ground truth's tabular format for precision (-0.5 point).
- **Strictness adjustment**: Under utmost strictness, the misclassification of C004 is not a "small error" but a clear evidentiary oversight in a short log (only 4 cases), warranting a notable deduction. Overall differences (incomplete analysis + factual inaccuracy) reduce the score from a potential 10.0, but the valid counterexample and correct final verdict prevent a harsher drop below 7.0.
