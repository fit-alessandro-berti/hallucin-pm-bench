The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides precise justification by citing the two violating CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with accurate activity sequences, directly addressing the prompt's requirements. This suffices to disprove the "always" claim using only log evidence, without introducing errors or extraneous information. Minor deduction for not explicitly verifying the non-violating cases (C001 and C003), which the ground truth includes for completeness, though this is not strictly required to refute the fact.
