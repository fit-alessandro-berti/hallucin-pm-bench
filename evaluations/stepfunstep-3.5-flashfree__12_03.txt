**9.5**

The LLM answer is correct (No, with accurate counterexamples from C002 and C004, matching the log sequences and disproving "always"). Justification cites relevant CaseIDs and sequences precisely, fulfilling the task requirements. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's full case-by-case exhaustiveness (omits confirming C001/C003 comply, no table format), despite sufficiency for logical disproof under strict evaluation. No factual errors.
