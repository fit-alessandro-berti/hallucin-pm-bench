3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer scores 3.5 due to fundamental mismatches in the core RACI assignments compared to the ground truth, despite correctly adhering to terminology. Small errors (e.g., abbreviated role headers, missing dual R/A notations, extraneous legend) compound to significant deductions, but partial credit is given for structure and vocabulary compliance. Below is a detailed assessment aligned with the provided rubric.

#### 1. **Correctness (Major Deduction: ~4 points lost)**
   - **Terminology**: Fully compliant (5/5). All mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are used exactly as specified with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere. Activities match the six process steps without alteration.
   - **RACI Allocations**: Poor match to ground truth and implied narrative (1/5). The ground truth reflects a more interconnected workflow where roles like Compliance Officer (CO), Finance Clerk (FC), and IT Support (IT) have broader involvement (e.g., Consulted or Informed) beyond the minimal "handled by" assignees in the process description. The LLM answer overly simplifies by using "-" (not involved) in ~50% of cells where ground truth assigns I or C, indicating unwarranted isolation of activities. Key discrepancies:
     - **Receive Application**: AM marked R (missing A for accountability); CO as I (vs. C); FC/IT as - (vs. I). Fails to capture broader consultation/notification.
     - **KYC Review**: AM as I (vs. A); FC as - (vs. C); IT as - (vs. I). Ignores accountability and consultation layers.
     - **Order Vetting**: AM as R (missing /A); FC/IT as - (vs. I). Partial, but incomplete.
     - **Payment Clearance**: AM as I (vs. A); CO as - (vs. C); IT as - (vs. I). Misses upstream accountability and downstream info flow.
     - **Record Update**: AM as I (vs. C); CO as - (vs. I); FC as - (vs. C). Completely misaligns consultation.
     - **Notify Customer**: AM as R (missing /A); CO as - (vs. I); IT as - (vs. I). Fails to reflect full stakeholder involvement.
     - Each activity has one R (correct per rubric), and AM is accountable in relevant spots (partial credit), but overall allocations do not "reflect the narrative" as the ground truth does—e.g., GT assumes logical cross-role interactions (e.g., FC consulted on KYC for financial implications) that LLM ignores.
   - **Formatting/Precision**: No bolding on key RACI elements or activity names as in GT (minor deduction). Dual R/A notations are omitted where required, treating R and A as separate rather than combined.

#### 2. **Unwarranted Content (Minor Deduction: ~0.5 points lost)**
   - No extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced—matrix sticks to the six activities and four roles (1/1). However, the added "Legend" is unnecessary (GT has none), introducing minor extraneous content that could be seen as self-indulgent explanation.

#### 3. **Self-Awareness (N/A)**
   - Not applicable, as all info is provided in the prompt (1/1).

#### Overall Rationale
- **Strengths (Supporting 3.5)**: Vocabulary policy strictly followed; basic matrix structure (rows/columns) intact; no hallucinations or additions.
- **Weaknesses (Driving Low Score)**: The RACI matrix is the prompt's core output, and ~70% of cell assignments differ from ground truth, violating the "more differences = lower grade" criterion. Even small errors like header abbreviations (AM vs. "Account Manager") and missing I/C notations reflect significant inaccuracies under strict evaluation, as they alter perceived role involvement. This isn't a minor deviation—it's a fundamentally incomplete/inaccurate representation of the workflow's collaborative nature implied by GT.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, small errors (e.g., 3-4 "-" vs. I/C per row) lead to outsized penalties, pulling from a potential 7.0 (for terms/structure) down to 3.5. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, it's functional but unreliable for process-mapping use.
