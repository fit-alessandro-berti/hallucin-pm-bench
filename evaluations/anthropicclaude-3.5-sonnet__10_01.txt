6.0

**Evaluation Breakdown:**

**1. Mandated Terminology (Vocabulary Policy):**
- ✔️ The LLM answer uses “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance”. The forbidden terms do not appear.
- ✔️ The spellings and capitalisation are correct.

**2. Structure & Roles:**
- ⚠️ The LLM answer uses role abbreviations (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of full names. The ground truth uses full names. This is a significant formal mismatch.
- ⚠️ The activities row also omits “Record Update” and “Notify Customer” as the last two (these did appear).

**3. RACI Allocations:**
- ✗ “Receive Application”:  
  - LLM: AM = R, CO = I, FC/IT = -  
  - GT: Account Manager = R/A, Compliance Officer = C, Finance Clerk = I, IT = I  
  - **Errors:** AM not marked as Accountable; other roles not properly assigned. 

- ✗ “KYC Review”:  
  - LLM: CO = R, AM = I  
  - GT: CO = R, AM = A  
  - **Errors:** Doesn’t assign Accountable (A) to AM. Excludes C/I assignments for FC and IT Support.

- ✗ “Order Vetting”:  
  - LLM: AM = R, CO = C  
  - GT: AM = R/A, CO = C, FC/IT = I  
  - **Errors:** AM not marked A. FC/IT missing I.

- ✗ “Payment Clearance”:  
  - LLM: FC = R, AM = I  
  - GT: FC = R, AM = A, CO = C, IT = I  
  - **Errors:** Missing A for AM, C for CO, I for IT.

- ✗ “Record Update”:  
  - LLM: IT = R, AM = I  
  - GT: IT = R, AM = C, FC = C, CO = I  
  - **Errors:** AM should be C not I. FC/CO assignments missing.

- ✗ “Notify Customer”:  
  - LLM: AM = R, FC = I  
  - GT: AM = R/A, CO/FC/IT = I  
  - **Errors:** AM not A, other roles limited to one I.

**4. Legend:**
- ✔️ Legend is present and accurate.

**5. Additional Criteria:**
- ✔️ No extra tasks/roles/columns introduced.
- ✔️ No forbidden terms.

---

**Summary of Losses:**
- Heavy loss of points for repeatedly omitting “A” (Accountable)—for most activities AM is not marked as Accountable as in the ground truth.
- Significant point loss for not including all (C, I) assignments present in the ground truth, and missing some assignments for FC and IT.
- Additional loss for using abbreviations rather than role names (less formal and deviates from ground truth).
- However, the required vocabulary policy is strictly followed and the general structure is a RACI matrix with the right activities.

**Conclusion:**  
Because it follows the vocabulary rules perfectly, gives an appropriate matrix structure and no forbidden content, but makes major errors in responsibilities/accountabilities per activity and in row/column headings, the answer deserves a 6.0—barely passing but with substantial room for improvement.
