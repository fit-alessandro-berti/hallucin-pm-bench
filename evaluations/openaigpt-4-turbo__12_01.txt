**9.5**

The LLM answer is factually correct, covers all cases accurately with precise sequences where relevant, correctly identifies the reversed order and absence, and disproves "always" and "immediately before." Justification cites case IDs and activities as required, with no guessing or errors.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic differences from ground truth: lacks "Short verdict" bolded format, bullet structure, exact line number citations (e.g., "lines 3-4"), and explicit "reversed"/"not after it" phrasing—small but per strictness rule warranting point loss despite semantic equivalence.
