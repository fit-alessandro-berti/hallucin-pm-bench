**4.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Correct elements (partial credit)**: Accurately identifies and lists the two true concurrent task sets from the first and second parallel splits (Quality_Check ‖ Update_Inventory; Generate_Replenishment_Report ‖ Notify_Procurement). Matches core content of ground truth Sets 1 and 2 (+4.0 points).
- **Major errors (significant deductions)**:
  - Introduces invalid **Set 3** with "Merge #1" and "Merge #2", which are *not* concurrent tasks on parallel branches (they are sequential merge gateways post-split, not executable tasks in parallel). Ground truth explicitly states "No other tasks... can run in parallel." This fabricates incorrect information, directly contradicting the prompt and process description (-3.0 points).
  - Misleading closing sentence claims *all* listed items "execute concurrently within each parallel split," incorrectly including merges (-1.5 points).
- **Minor formatting/strictness deductions**:
  - Uses "**Set X:**" bold/bullets instead of numbered "1. **Set 1 – ...**" style; lacks descriptive labels ("first parallel block"), backticks (`), and ‖ symbol (-0.5 points).
  - Deviates from "list each set... Number the sets" by adding extra explanatory text beyond pure listing (-0.5 points).

Overall: Substantially deviates with fabricated concurrent sets and misinterpretation of BPMN elements (merges ≠ parallel tasks), warranting low-mid score under utmost strictness despite correct partial matches.
