The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is impossible to compute the requested metrics due to the lack of event rows and timestamp data in the given event-log stub. It also notes that while the SLA catalogue contains some average figures, these do not provide the required per-case or per-activity duration detail.

However, the answer is slightly less direct and more verbose than the ground truth, including superfluous information (such as an unnecessary explanation of what would be needed and what the SLA catalogue contains). The ideal answer would simply and directly state the impossibility and root cause, as the ground truth does.

There are no factual inaccuracies, but the lack of concise, precise wording and the inclusion of minorly irrelevant details justifies a one-point deduction.
