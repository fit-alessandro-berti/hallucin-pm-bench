**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary (perfect match, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms.
- **Structure (+1.0 partial)**: Matrix format correct (activities rows, roles columns); all 6 activities and 4 roles present; no extra tasks/roles/columns.
- **RACI Content (major deductions, -6.0+)**: Significant mismatches vs. ground truth across 4/6 rows (15/24 cells differ, including key R/A vs. R separations, A assignments, and C/I swaps). Examples:
  | Activity | Key Differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Receive Application | CO: I vs. **C** |
  | KYC Review | AM: C vs. **A**; CO: R/A vs. **R**; FC: I vs. **C** |
  | Payment Clearance | AM: I vs. **A**; CO: I vs. **C**; FC: R/A vs. **R** |
  | Record Update | AM: I vs. **C**; IT: R/A vs. **R** |
  Rows 3 & 6 match exactly.
- **Formatting/Presentation (-1.0)**: Headers add unwarranted "(AM)" etc.; activities prefixed with numbers (**1.**, etc.); inconsistent bolding (all activities bold vs. GT's selective **R**, **R/A**, **KYC Review**).
- **Unwarranted Content (-2.0)**: Adds title, "Key" table, "Rationale notes" section with invented explanations (e.g., "AM is Consulted as document submission owner"; compliance flags) not in prompt or process description—violates "no extra" expectation.
- **Overall Strictness**: ~62% cell similarity insufficient; multiple per-row errors + extras compound to low score despite vocab/structure strengths. No self-awareness issue.
