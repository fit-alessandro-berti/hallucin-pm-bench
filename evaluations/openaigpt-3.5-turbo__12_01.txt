**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on every key point, directly contradicting the event-log data and ground truth:

- **Verdict error**: Claims "accurate" instead of "inaccurate" (reverses the core fact).
- **Case 1001 justification**: Falsely states "Authorize_Refund" before "Update_Inventory" (actual order: Update_Inventory at 08:25:55 → Authorize_Refund at 08:30:02).
- **Case 1002**: Correctly notes absence of Update_Inventory (disproves "always"), but ignores this to wrongly conclude fact "holds true."
- **Case 1003**: Falsely states "Authorize_Refund" before "Update_Inventory" (actual: Update_Inventory at 10:08:07 → Authorize_Refund at 10:22:18).
- No evidence-based citations to lines/timestamps; invents reversed orderings.

Total failure to base statements on data; score reflects maximal deviation under strict criteria.
