3.5

### Evaluation Reasoning (Strict Assessment)
I evaluated the LLM answer with utmost strictness against the ground truth, penalizing all differences in structure, content, roles, task granularity, assignments, and fidelity to the source informal description. Even minor deviations (e.g., swapped R/C/I roles or extra granularity) result in significant point deductions, as per instructions. The score reflects partial credit for basic adherence to the prompt (Markdown RACI table, mandated vocabulary like "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst," and coverage of source steps) but heavy penalties for non-matching elements.

#### Key Strengths (Supporting ~3.5 Score):
- **Format**: Produces a valid Markdown RACI table, clearly organized with columns for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.
- **Mandated Vocabulary**: Strictly uses "KYC Review" (e.g., row 4), "Transaction Analyst" (for clerk duties), and "Regulatory Liaison" (for compliance officer duties). No use of forbidden terms like "CDD" or "Compliance Officer." IT Support is retained from the source text, which is appropriate as it's not contradicted by mandates.
- **Coverage of Source**: Maps all informal steps without omissions—e.g., receiving/logging (rows 1-2), screening (row 3), KYC (row 4), high-risk assessment/approval (rows 5-6), release (row 7), SWIFT sending (row 8), archiving (row 9), and notification (row 10). This is more granular than the source but comprehensive.
- **Role Mapping**: Correctly substitutes source roles (clerk → Transaction Analyst, compliance officer → Regulatory Liaison), avoiding extras beyond source + mandates.

#### Major Weaknesses (Heavy Deductions for Differences from Ground Truth):
- **Structure and Presentation** (-1.5 points): Ground truth uses a horizontal format (tasks as rows, roles as columns, with R/A/C/I letters in cells), includes a "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" header, bolding for "KYC Review," and a separate legend. LLM uses a vertical format (#, Activity description, then R/A/C/I columns), which is functional but structurally divergent. No legend, no bolding, and overly verbose activity names (e.g., "Receive customer transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"). This is a format mismatch, not minor.
  
- **Roles Used** (-2.0 points): Ground truth includes four roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support), with Operations Manager as Accountable (A) for every task—a supervisory role implied but not in the source or mandated terms. LLM omits Operations Manager entirely, using only three roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support). This introduces a core discrepancy: all A assignments in LLM are self-assigned to the Responsible party (e.g., A = Transaction Analyst for TA tasks), while ground truth consistently assigns A to Operations Manager. Prompt mandates "using *only* the mandated terms... for activities and roles," but ground truth adds an unmandated role, yet evaluation requires matching ground truth, so this is a fail. Additionally, LLM's "IT Support" in columns is correct but doesn't align with the four-role setup.

- **Task Granularity and Wording** (-1.5 points): LLM expands the source into 10 rows, splitting tasks (e.g., separate "Receive" and "Log"; "Assess high-risk" as new row 5; "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" as row 8; "Notify" as row 10). Ground truth consolidates into 6 concise rows (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" combines 1-2; no separate assessment or SWIFT/notify rows; "Archive Record" folds in notification). LLM's extras go beyond the source without justification, creating non-matching tasks. Wording differences: LLM uses descriptive phrases (e.g., "Screen payment against sanctions list"); ground truth uses mandated/concise phrasing (e.g., "Screen Against Sanctions List," "**KYC Review**"). No exact matches in row count or titles, violating "maps every step... without omissions or substitutions."

- **RACI Assignments** (-1.5 points): Many per-task assignments differ, even where tasks align approximately. Examples:
  - **Receive**: LLM (R/A: Transaction Analyst, C: Regulatory Liaison, I: IT Support) vs. ground truth (R: TA, A: Operations Manager, C: IT Support, I: Regulatory Liaison)—A differs (TA vs. OM); C/I swapped (RL vs. IT).
  - **Screen**: LLM (R: TA, A: RL, C: RL, I: IT) vs. ground truth (R: TA, A: RL, C: IT, I: OM)—C: RL (redundant/extra) vs. IT; I: IT vs. OM; no OM role.
  - **KYC Review**: LLM (R/A: RL, C: TA, I: IT) vs. ground truth (R: RL, A: OM, C: TA, I: IT)—A: RL vs. OM (mismatch); otherwise close.
  - **Approve High-Risk**: Similar to KYC but LLM adds unneeded row 5 ("Assess") with identical assignments (R/A: RL, C: TA, I: IT), duplicating effort vs. ground truth's single row.
  - **Release**: LLM (R/A: TA, C: RL, I: IT) vs. ground truth (R: TA, A: OM, C: IT, I: RL)—A differs; C/I swapped (RL vs. IT).
  - **SWIFT/Archive/Notify**: LLM separates into three rows (R/A: IT for all, with varying C/I), vs. ground truth's single "Archive Record" (R: IT, A: OM, C: TA, I: RL)—no SWIFT row; assignments differ (e.g., I: TA in LLM row 9 vs. C: TA in ground truth; separate notify row unnecessary).
  These swaps and self-accountability are small errors individually but cumulatively major, as RACI precision is critical. Redundant C (e.g., RL consulting itself in row 3) and "-" in row 10 are sloppy.

#### Overall: Why 3.5?
- Base (1.0): Minimal for producing a table and using some mandated terms.
- Partial credit (+2.5): Good vocabulary adherence, full source coverage, logical role mapping (no forbidden terms).
- Total deductions (~6.5 points lost): Structural mismatch, missing Operations Manager (altering all A's), extra/granular tasks, and ~70% assignment differences. If it matched ground truth's exact rows, roles, and letters, it would score 10.0; here, it's a reinterpretation, not a match. Stricter scoring could go to 2.0, but LLM's completeness prevents a total fail.
