2.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology Correctness (max 3.0 points)**: Full credit (3.0). The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. All activities match the required six from the process description.
  
- **RACI Allocations Correctness (max 5.0 points)**: Minimal credit (0.5). Major failures across nearly all rows—assignments do not reflect the ground truth or narrative implications:
  - Each activity has exactly one Responsible (R or R/A), but this is the only partial match.
  - Account Manager (AM) is often marked Accountable (A) where appropriate, but incorrectly in others (e.g., KYC Review: LLM has C instead of A; Payment Clearance: C instead of A).
  - Widespread omissions and errors: Blanks ("-") ignore required Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles (e.g., Receive Application misses CO C, FC I, IT I; KYC Review misses FC C/IT I and misplaces AM as C/CO as R/A instead of A/CO R; Record Update has AM I instead of C, misses CO/FC C, IT R/A instead of R; similar issues in Order Vetting, Payment Clearance, Notify Customer).
  - No row fully matches ground truth; even partial matches (e.g., Order Vetting core R/A) are incomplete without secondary roles.
  - Strict rubric penalty: These are not "small errors"—they fundamentally misrepresent responsibilities per the narrative (e.g., CO performs KYC Review, implying R, with AM A; IT refreshes CRM, implying R without R/A overreach).

- **Format and Presentation (max 1.0 point)**: No credit (0.0). Uses a plain-text table with abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) instead of full role names; no markdown piping or bolding for R/A emphasis as in ground truth. Includes an unwarranted legend (extra content, though not tasks/roles/columns). Dashes ("-") for blanks deviate from ground truth's explicit fillings (C/I).

- **Unwarranted Content (max 1.0 point)**: Partial credit (0.0, but legend is minor bloat—no extra tasks/roles/columns added, so no further deduction beyond format).

- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, multiple differences (incomplete/wrong RACI in 5/6 rows) warrant severe deduction. Ground truth emphasizes distributed roles reflecting process flow (e.g., notifications/informations), which LLM ignores. Total reflects ~75% mismatch in core content.
