6.0

**Evaluation:**

- The LLM answer correctly uses the required preferred terminology: "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"—no forbidden terms are present.
- The format is broadly correct as a RACI matrix, roles and activities are clearly labelled.

**Significant issues:**

1. **Major omission of role participation**:
    - The LLM answer only lists R/A, C, I for a **subset** of roles for each activity; in the ground truth, each activity-row has all four roles with appropriate R/A/C/I.
    - Many roles are simply not marked at all (left blank), whereas they should be I (Informed) or C (Consulted). This is a material error.

2. **Allocation differences**:
    - For several tasks, e.g., "Receive Application," the LLM answer leaves CO, FC, and IT blank, instead of providing C, I, or I as in ground truth.
    - "Record Update": The LLM answer lists only IT Support (R/A) and AM (I), omitting FC (should be C) and CO (should be I).
    - "KYC Review": FC should be C and IT should be I—these are not captured.

3. **Formatting**:
    - The answer is readable, but the ground truth uses a clear markdown table. (Small markdown difference, but not critical compared to factual issues.)

**Conclusion:**
- The strict evaluation policy requires a significant point deduction for omitting C/I denotations for non-primary roles.
- The main value is recognizing the required vocabulary and basic mapping of R/A for main roles, but insufficient coverage and detail drop the score substantially.

**Therefore:** 6.0. The maximum possible with this level of omission and imprecision, but not lower due to correct terminology and at least plausible main assignments.
