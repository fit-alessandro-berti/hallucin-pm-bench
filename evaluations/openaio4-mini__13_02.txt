The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and rounding. For question 3, the response is concise (68 words), addresses the single occurrence, highlights instability/variance (e.g., "unreliable estimates, high variance"), and warns against over-generalization (e.g., "won’t generalize—rare events need larger samples"), aligning with all required criteria without invention or deviation.
