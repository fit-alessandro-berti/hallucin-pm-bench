The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes the exact average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim (with minor formatting like "h" vs. no unit, but values match), and stays under 150 words (~120 words). It includes a professional memo structure, omits all service times, throughput, and extraneous activities, fully adhering to core prompt constraints.

Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting-time bottlenecks (e.g., automation to reduce queuing), and imply ≥20% reductions through efficiency gains, without unsupported data invention. However, it deducts points for not explicitly stating the ≥20% cut (as required and present in ground truth) and for differing actions from ground truth (e.g., RPA vs. reminders; real-time generation vs. e-signatures; push routing vs. rules-engine), introducing moderate divergence despite relevance. No other errors.
