The LLM answer accurately identifies that the average cycle time cannot be derived due to the absence of timestamps or durations, mirroring the ground truth's core reasoning about lacking temporal information. It structures the response to directly address both parts of the user query, follows the system policy by clearly stating the limitation, and avoids any fabrication. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed," inclusion of benchmark irrelevance) do not introduce errors or deviations from the ground truth's intent, maintaining full fidelity under strict evaluation.
