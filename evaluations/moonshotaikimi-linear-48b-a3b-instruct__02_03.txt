The LLM answer is highly accurate in content, correctly identifying the number of cases (3), the preceding activity (Pack_Items), and the unique activity (Cancel_Order). However, it deducts a point for the minor but noticeable difference in Q1, where the ground truth explicitly lists the cases (C123, C456, C789) for completeness, while the LLM omits them, and for slight formatting variance (simple bullets vs. structured * **A1:** labels), despite both adhering to concise bullet-point style.
