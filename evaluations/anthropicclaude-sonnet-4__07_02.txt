The LLM answer is quite close to the ground truth but contains some minor issues that warrant point deductions:

- Added tasks: The answer lists all three correct additions with clear task names and IDs and adds a clarifying note that "Final Reject" replaces the previous reject task. This is an extra interpretation that goes slightly beyond the strict summary required, as it adds process commentary not strictly about presence/absence.

- Removed tasks: Correctly lists only "Reject Loan" with the right ID.

- Gateway-type changes: The answer correctly notes the gateway switching from exclusive to inclusive. However, it adds further explanations about parallel paths and flow names/quantities. While informative, this slightly exceeds "strictly" listing the change in type as requested and could be seen as surplus. The ground-truth answer stops at "changed from exclusive to inclusive".

- The LLM sticks to the three headings, doesn't invent new ones, and ignores cosmetic changes as requested.

Overall, while all substantive content is correct, the inclusion of process commentary and elaborative details, and offering descriptions like "replaces the previous reject task" (which slightly departs from the instruction to only note presence/absence), result in minor deviations from the expected strictness. According to the instruction that even small errors should cause significant loss of points, this warrants a loss of 2 points.
