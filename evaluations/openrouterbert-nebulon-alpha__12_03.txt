The LLM answer is fully accurate, correctly identifies "No" as the response, and provides a precise justification citing the exact counterexamples (C002 and C004) with their sequences, while noting the compliant cases (C001, C003). This matches the ground truth's core content and logic exactly, despite stylistic differences (text list vs. table). No factual errors, omissions, or deviations; all relevant CaseIDs and sequences are covered equivalently under utmost strictness.
