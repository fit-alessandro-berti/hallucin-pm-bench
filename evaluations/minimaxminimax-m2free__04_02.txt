4.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies compliances for R1, R3, R4, and R6, with appropriate statuses and concise justifications under 20 words, and the overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion is accurate due to at least one violation. However, it errs significantly on R2 (incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated; justification ignores the new approval on 2025-03-07 as the "last required approval" post-change, allowing Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 to violate the 2-day window) and R5 (incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated; justification overlooks Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice as "further processing steps" occurring before the new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07). These are major factual and interpretive errors on interdependent rules, leading to under-detection of violations and substantial deviation from ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria.
