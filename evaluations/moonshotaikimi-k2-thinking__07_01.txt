The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed task: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive) with no speculation or extras, aligning with the prompt's requirements for content and headings. However, it loses points for deviations from the ground truth in strict detail and format: uses only task IDs without including full names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status") or the "(id = `...`)" structure; omits version specifics like "(v1)" and "(v2)" in the gateway change; and employs plain sub-bullets (-) instead of italicized (*) styles. These omissions and formatting mismatches, though minor, warrant a deduction under utmost strictness for not fully matching the reference's presentation of element details. No other categories (e.g., none reported incorrectly).
