The LLM answer fails to cover every activity described in the narrative, omitting key steps like "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" (or equivalents), which results in an incomplete matrix and violates the prompt's requirement to include **every activity**. It merges or ignores escalation, scheduling, and notification into the existing four activities, directly contravening "do not rename, merge, or add activities." RACI assignments are inaccurate across multiple cells compared to the ground truth (e.g., Intake Vetting lacks Treasury Ops as I and misassigns Compliance Analyst as I instead of C; KYC Review and AML Screening miss Compliance Officer as C and Treasury Ops as I; Risk Scoring incorrectly assigns Compliance Analyst as RA instead of R, Front-Office Analyst as C, and Compliance Officer as A instead of C). The output includes unrequested summary text and a repeated "Final Answer" section, exceeding the prompt's instruction to "Return the matrix as a Markdown table." Formatting inconsistencies (empty cells vs. ground truth's â€“) and partial omissions of roles (e.g., no involvement shown for some roles in certain activities) compound the errors. While authorized vocabulary is used correctly (no synonyms leaked), the overall deviations are substantial, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation.
