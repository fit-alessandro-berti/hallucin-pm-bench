2.5

The LLM answer demonstrates some understanding of the vocabulary policy by using only the authorized terms—Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, and Risk Scoring. However, significant deviations from the ground truth result in a very low score:

**Major Errors:**
- The LLM omitted three activities that appear in the process and in the ground truth: “Compliance Officer Approval,” “Release Funds,” and did not split the process into all granular activities as specified.
- The role allocations are incorrect for multiple activities, e.g.:
  - "Intake Vetting" incorrectly marks Compliance Analyst as Informed (should be Consulted), omits Treasury Ops as Informed; gives RA to Front-Office Analyst without separating them.
  - "Risk Scoring" lists Compliance Analyst as both R and A, instead of Risk Scoring being R for CA and A for Compliance Officer (with other correct C/I assignments).
- C (Consulted) and I (Informed) assignments are missing or incorrect in nearly every row.
- The matrix uses "RA" as a compact “Responsible, Accountable” designation, but does not explicitly split roles when they should not overlap (per ground truth).

**Minor Errors:**
- There is some effort to include all authorized terms and roles, no synonyms are output.
- The table format nearly matches, but inconsistency in splitting roles/responsibilities as per ground truth.
- The summary explanation, while not forbidden, is superfluous.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer fails to capture half the required activities, consistently misassigns responsibilities, and does not match the granularity, accuracy, or explicitness of the ground truth. The only redeeming aspect is adherence to the vocabulary policy and the presence of a matrix. Thus, 2.5 is the strict score: significant loss for missing activities and multiple role errors, with a small fraction of points for following naming policy and overall structure.
