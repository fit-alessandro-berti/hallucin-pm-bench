**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in all aspects: Q1 matches exactly (3); Q2 matches the sequence verbatim (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order); Q3 lists the exact two distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), one per line and alphabetically ordered, with no extras, omissions, or errors. Minor rendering differences (e.g., ground truth's dashes/<br> vs. LLM's plain lines) are irrelevant as they exceed the prompt's requirements and do not alter precision. No hallucinations or deviations.
