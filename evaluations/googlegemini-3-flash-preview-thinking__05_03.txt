### Evaluation Rationale (strict criteria applied):
- **Functional correctness (high weight)**: LLM solution correctly adds an interrupting boundary timer event (default `cancelActivity="true"` even if omitted) on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H` duration, routing to the existing unused `Activity_AMReview` via sequence flow. This enforces the SLA by escalating on timeout without new activities. Matches ground truth intent perfectly (+2.5/2.5).
- **XML fidelity to ground truth (high weight, strict)**: 
  - Core elements (boundaryEvent, attachedToRef, timerEventDefinition, timeDuration, sequenceFlow targetRef) match.
  - Differences deduct heavily: missing explicit `cancelActivity="true"` (-0.5), different `id`/`name` attributes (-0.3), extraneous `id="TimerDef_1"` on timerEventDefinition (-0.2), lacks explanatory comments/numbered steps (-0.3), different sequenceFlow `id` (-0.2). Total XML deduction: -1.5.
- **Justification fidelity (medium weight, strict)**: One sentence as required, correctly describes mechanism and reuse of existing task. Minor inaccuracies ("system integration fails" implies fault vs. pure timeout; adds "unused" and "service task" not in GT) and non-matching wording reduce match (-0.7). Matches essence but not verbatim.
- **Adherence to task constraints**: No new activities/subprocesses, only added/changed XML + one-sentence justification. Formatting uses ```xml correctly. (+0.5 bonus, but strictness caps).
- **Overall**: Excellent functional match (9+/10 possible), but multiple small textual/attribute differences mandate significant deductions per instructions (net 8.0). Identical XML/justification would be 10.0.
