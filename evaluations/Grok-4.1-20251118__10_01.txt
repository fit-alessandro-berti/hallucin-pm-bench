4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Strong, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This fully matches the ground truth and prompt policy.
  
- **Structure and Format (Partial, +1.0 point)**: The matrix has the correct rows (activities) and columns (roles), with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. However, it uses parentheses in column headers (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)"), which the ground truth omits, and includes an unwarranted "Key" section and explanatory sentence at the end, adding non-essential content not present in the ground truth. Bolding is absent where the ground truth uses it for emphasis on key RACI entries (e.g., **R**). The use of blanks for "not involved" simplifies but deviates from the full RACI spectrum.

- **RACI Allocations (Weak, +1.5 points)**: Significant differences from the ground truth, violating the "reflect the narrative" criterion with incomplete and inaccurate assignments. Strict deduction for omissions and errors:
  - **Correct Elements**: Matches Responsible (R) for core performers per the process description (e.g., CO for KYC Review, FC for Payment Clearance, IT for Record Update, AM for Order Vetting/Notify Customer/Receive Application). Accountable (A) is partially correct for AM in KYC Review and Payment Clearance.
  - **Major Errors/Omissions (Heavy Deduction)**:
    - Misses all Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles across every activity, rendering the matrix incomplete as a full RACI (e.g., ground truth has CO as C in Receive Application, Order Vetting, and Payment Clearance; FC as C in KYC Review and Record Update; multiple I entries like IT I in several steps). Blanks do not substitute for explicit C/I, especially since the ground truth shows involvement beyond R/A.
    - Incorrect for Record Update: Assigns AM as A (unwarranted; ground truth has AM as C, with no A specified). This misaligns with the narrative (IT performs, no AM accountability mentioned).
    - Inconsistent A vs. R/A for AM: Ground truth combines R/A for Receive Application, Order Vetting, and Notify Customer (reflecting AM's handling role implying dual responsibility/accountability), but LLM uses only R, understating AM's role.
    - No single activity has "exactly one Responsible" violation, but the overall sparsity ignores consultative/informative flows implied in the workflow narrative (e.g., documents "arrive" for CO after AM's Receive Application, suggesting C/I links).
  - Each activity shows 2-4 deviations, leading to ~50% accuracy on visible entries alone, but the missing C/I halves the matrix's utility.

- **Overall Correctness and Strictness Penalty (-4.0 points total)**: While the LLM captures the "performs the activity" basics from the process description, it fails to infer or represent the fuller RACI dynamics (C/I) evident in the ground truth, which better reflects interconnected workflow ownership (e.g., AM's overarching accountability). Small errors like R vs. R/A and extra text compound to significant loss, as even minor mismatches (e.g., no bolding, header parentheses) detract under utmost strictness. The answer is functional but not faithful to the ground truth's detail and completeness.
