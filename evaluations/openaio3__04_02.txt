6.5

R1: Correct, compliant with proper justification.

R2: LLM answer is incorrect. It claims Ship_Goods is within 2 days of the "last approval" (Finance_Approval), but after a Change_Request, per rule and per correct reading (as the ground truth notes), a new Manager_Approval is required before further processing, thus the correct timing anchor shifts: Ship_Goods occurs before the required new Manager_Approval, so the 2-day limit should have started after this new approval. The LLM answer fails to identify this, while the ground truth correctly calls this a violation.

R3: Correct, violated with accurate description.

R4: Correct, N/A.

R5: Correct, violated for the right reason.

R6: Correct, compliant.

Overall result is correct.

Significant error on R2, but no major errors elsewhere. The R2 misunderstanding, given it's a critical process-flow logic error, is substantial and merits losing several points from a perfect score.

Penalties:  
- Major R2 misreading (-2.0)  
- Slightly less concise justifications than ground truth, but within specs (-0.5)  

Final: 6.5
