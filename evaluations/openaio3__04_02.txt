6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Format Adherence**: The LLM answer closely follows the required format (status per rule with ≤20-word justification, all-caps overall result). No deductions here, but strictness requires perfect matching to ground truth content.
- **R1**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification is accurate but adds unnecessary details (dates/amount); ground truth is more concise. Minor difference: -0.5 points.
- **R2**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated). LLM fails to account for the Change_Request triggering a new required Manager_Approval on 03-07, making the initial Finance_Approval (03-04) not the "last required approval." Ship_Goods (03-05) occurs before this final approval and outside the 2-day window post it. Critical analytical error tied to R5 interplay: -2.5 points.
- **R3**: Status matches (Violated). Justifications nearly identical. No deduction.
- **R4**: Status matches (Not Applicable). Justifications equivalent. No deduction.
- **R5**: Status matches (Violated). Justification correct but incomplete—omits Pay_Invoice as a further processing step before new approval (ground truth includes it). Small error, but strict: -0.5 points.
- **R6**: Status matches (Compliant). Justifications similar. No deduction.
- **Overall Result**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT). Ground truth specifies violations (R2, R3, R5); LLM implies them but misses R2, weakening the conclusion's basis. Minor: -0.5 points.

Total starting from 10.0, deductions lead to 6.5. The R2 error is a significant compliance misjudgment, reflecting incomplete trace analysis.
