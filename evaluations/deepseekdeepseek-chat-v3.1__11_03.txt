### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth selection and grounding all mentions in the table data (e.g., throughput times, waiting times, SLAs). It uses a professional memo format, confines bullets to recommendations only, and returns solely the memo text, adhering to instructions. Quantifications are mostly accurate (e.g., Risk Review's double SLA, Legal's 50% breach, Credit's +60s), with waiting time percentages correctly derived from data (e.g., 80% for Risk Review as 480/600). Recommendations are bulleted, concrete, and loosely data-driven via bottlenecks/queues.

However, strict deductions for:
- Incomplete quantification: Prompt requires "quantifies by how much each activity exceeds its SLA"; LLM uses indirect phrasing (e.g., "double" for Risk Review's +300s, "50% breach" for Legal's +300s) instead of explicit seconds excess like ground truth (+300s, +300s, +60s), a significant mismatch (-1.5 points).
- Ungrounded inventions: Adds "Q3 data" and "loan origination process" not in table, violating "ground every sentence in the data supplied; do NOT invent" (-0.5 points).
- Minor differences: Activity order differs (Risk first vs. Legal); recommendations are generic (e.g., "re-allocate resources") vs. ground truth's more precise, inventive-but-actionable ideas (e.g., "add one risk analyst"); no total cases mention or projection, reducing completeness (-0.5 points).
- Length: ≈220 words exceeds ≈150 target slightly, though not disqualifying.

Overall, strong alignment (80% match) but penalized heavily for precision gaps per strict criteria.
