**9.0**

The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly answering "**No**" and providing a one-paragraph justification that cites the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order) as the ground truth, directly refuting the "always follows" claim. It follows the prompt's structure perfectly (Yes/No only, then one paragraph with citations). Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessarily citing line 12 (Cancel_Order) in C005, which is irrelevant to the claim and introduces extraneous detail slightly diluting precision (-0.5); (2) phrasing "occurs before *Cancel_Order* without any prior *Receive_Order*" vs. ground truth's cleaner "never contains *Receive_Order* at all" (-0.3); (3) less emphatic "does not always" mirroring vs. ground truth's explicit "**not always**" and "prove" (-0.2). Under utmost strictness, these small imprecisions warrant a 1.0-point loss from perfection, but the core logic, citations, and fidelity remain excellent.
