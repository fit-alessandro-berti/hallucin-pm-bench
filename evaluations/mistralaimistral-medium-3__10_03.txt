5.0

Rationale:

Major alignment issues:

- The LLM answer uses the correct, authorized vocabulary ONLY for the column headers and main activities (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”), which is good – no banned synonyms or alternative phrasings appear. There is correct avoidance of disallowed vocabulary.
- However, the activity listing in the table diverges from the ground truth: it invents/merges/renames activities (“Approval”, “Payment Release”, “Notification”), instead of precisely mirroring the ground truth’s “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”. This is against the user’s “do not rename, merge, or add activities” policy.
- The matrix is missing some activities explicitly required in the ground truth (e.g., “Compliance Officer Approval” is not listed as such).
- Assignment of R, A, C, I is often incorrect or too simplistic compared to the ground truth:
    - “Intake Vetting” misses “A” (Accountable) for Front-Office Analyst.
    - “KYC Review” and “AML Screening” miss “A” for Compliance Analyst.
    - “Risk Scoring” omits “A” for Compliance Officer and misassigns “Consulted” to Compliance Officer instead.
    - Activities like “Release Funds” and “Notification” are inappropriately separated, whereas the ground truth uses “Release Funds” only and correctly assigns "R, A" to Treasury Ops; “Notification” is not a distinct activity in the ground truth.
    - R, A, C, I assignments consistently do not match the more granular, correct assignments of the ground truth.
- “–” is not used to clearly mark “no involvement”, as is required.

Strengths:

- Only the authorized vocabulary is used (no synonym leakage).
- General structure (roles vs. activities) is correct in form.
- Some mapping of Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed generally aligns for the most basic steps.

But due to:  
(1) significant inaccuracy in activity naming/merging,  
(2) systematic errors in RACI assignments for almost every activity,  
(3) absence of “–” mark for uninvolved roles,  
this answer is only partially correct and well short of strict policy compliance.

Thus, a 5.0 reflects that the LLM avoided outright forbidden terms but has major, fundamental flaws in process mapping and assignment details.
