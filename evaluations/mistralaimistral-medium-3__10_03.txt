3.0

The LLM answer demonstrates correct usage of the four mandated vocabulary terms without synonyms or leaks, which aligns with the policy. However, it incurs severe penalties for multiple violations of the prompt's instructions and significant deviations from the ground truth:

- **Added, renamed, and merged activities incorrectly**: The prompt forbids renaming, merging, or adding activities. The LLM adds three new activities ("Approval", "Payment Release", "Notification") not present in the ground truth, uses slightly different naming ("Approval" vs. "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Payment Release" vs. "Release Funds"), and fails to cover the exact set in the ground truth (e.g., omits explicit "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" as structured). This alone warrants a major deduction for non-compliance.

- **Inaccurate RACI assignments across nearly all cells**: With utmost strictness, even minor mismatches (e.g., I vs. C; missing Treasury I; failure to combine R,A for the same role) result in significant point loss. Key mismatches include:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Missing Front-Office A; Compliance I (should be C); omits Treasury I.
  - **KYC Review**: Missing Compliance A and Officer C; adds erroneous Front-Office I; omits Treasury I.
  - **AML Screening**: Identical issues to KYC Review (treated as separate but with same errors).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office I (should be C); Officer C (should be A); omits Treasury I; no R,A combination.
  - Additional rows ("Approval", etc.) have partial overlaps but incorrect details (e.g., Compliance I vs. C in "Approval"; missing Treasury A and Officer/Compliance C in "Payment Release"; unwarranted separate "Notification" row with inaccurate Treasury R and universal I).

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses blanks instead of "â€“" for no involvement; lacks bolding for activities/roles as in ground truth; includes an unrequested explanatory "Key" section, which adds extraneous content.

These errors collectively indicate incomplete fidelity to the process narrative translation and ground truth structure, resulting in a low score despite vocabulary adherence.
