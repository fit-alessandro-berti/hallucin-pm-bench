1.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
This evaluation is based on a strict comparison to the ground truth, penalizing all deviations in terminology, structure, content, and RACI accuracy. The LLM answer fails catastrophically across multiple dimensions, warranting the minimum score.

- **Terminology Violations (-3.0 points)**: The prompt mandates **exact** use of “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” while **never** using “Customer Due Diligence”, “Order Validation”, or “Payment Processing” (even in notes or as separate entries). The LLM answer includes forbidden terms as full rows (“Order Validation” and “Payment Processing”) and references them in the note (“Order Validation, Payment Processing”). This is a direct, egregious breach of the "STRICT" vocabulary policy, introducing polluted content.

- **Structural and Content Errors (-3.0 points)**: The ground truth has exactly 6 activities matching the process description (with remapped terms). The LLM adds 2 unwarranted extra rows (“Order Validation” and “Payment Processing”), violating the "no extra tasks" rubric. It also uses a non-standard 4-column header (with abbreviations in parentheses) vs. the ground truth's cleaner format. The note introduces self-contradictory explanations (e.g., relabeling steps as "5" and "4" while claiming adherence).

- **RACI Accuracy and Allocations (-3.0 points)**: The ground truth uses standard RACI notation (R, A, C, I, with / for combined R/A) and ensures exactly one Responsible (R) per activity, aligned to roles (e.g., AM as R/A for Receive Application; CO as R for KYC Review; FC as R for Payment Clearance; IT as R for Record Update; AM as R/A for Notify Customer; logical C/I elsewhere). The LLM uses invalid notation (numbers like "1" for R, "2" for A, "△" for "neither"), with multiple "1"s (Responsibles) per row (e.g., two in Order Vetting, two in Record Update, two in Notify Customer). Assignments mismatch the narrative (e.g., FC as "1" in Order Vetting, which is AM's role; AM as "1" in Record Update, which is IT's). No bolding or proper A/C/I distribution.

- **Overall Adherence and Rubric Compliance (0.0 bonus/penalty)**: Fails correctness (forbidden terms appear; no single R per activity; AM accountability inconsistent or absent). Introduces unwarranted content (extras, invalid symbols, erroneous note). Total differences are pervasive, with no redeeming fidelity to the ground truth beyond partial use of 3 mandated terms amid chaos.
