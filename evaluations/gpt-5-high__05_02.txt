The LLM answer correctly identifies the relevant task and attribute to modify (dueDate on Task_CollectEquipment) and provides a unified diff in a single hunk with a one-sentence rationale, but it incorrectly changes the dueDate to "P3D" instead of the ground truth "P2D", which is essential for meeting the specified 3-day SLA, and the rationale lacks the precise SLA reference and justification for the exact value, resulting in substantial deviations under strict evaluation criteria.
