**9.5**

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and comprehensive, closely mirroring the ground truth in structure, content, and detail with no hallucinations (e.g., no improper mentions of KYC/AML or credit-bureau). Both parts identify exactly the two decision points and list all 9 documents in precise first-appearance order.

- **Part a)**: Perfect identification of both decision points. Descriptions accurately capture the rules in one sentence each per prompt requirements. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "skip ... (step 5); otherwise proceed" vs. GT's "bypasses ...; otherwise it proceeds"; "application passes if at least two ...; fewer than two means it does not pass" vs. GT's "may advance only when at least two ... record 'Approve'"; inclusion of step references and explicit failure case) are semantically equivalent but not identical. Currency formatting (€250,000 with comma vs. GT/prompt's €250 000 with space) is a small inconsistency.
  
- **Part b)**: Identical list to ground truth, word-for-word (including distinguishing "Offer Sheet 77" from "Signed Offer Sheet 77").

Deductions (-0.5 total) reflect utmost strictness for small differences: currency formatting (-0.2), minor phrasing variances and extra failure clause (-0.3). No major errors or omissions.
