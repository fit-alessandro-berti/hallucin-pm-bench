The LLM answer makes the correct change in the XML diff—reducing the "Collect Equipment" task's due date from 5 days to 2 days—which aligns exactly with the ground truth's expectation.

However, the rationale, while accurate, slightly diverges in two details:
- It refers to "cutting the overall onboarding lead-time by 3 days," which is a minor inference the ground truth does not state (the SLA window could be 3 days, but this is not explicit).
- It says "removes the largest bottleneck" (a valid observation but not derived directly from the provided information or the ground truth).
- The ground truth simply says "keeps the overall onboarding cycle inside the contractual 3-day SLA," which is a more specific and relevant justification.

Therefore, despite the diff being perfectly precise, these small but unnecessary additions in the rationale merit a minor penalty under a strict grading regime.
