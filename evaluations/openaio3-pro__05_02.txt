The LLM answer matches the ground truth almost exactly in the core diff content and intent, with only minor phrasing variations in the rationale (e.g., "deadline" vs. "due-date", added interpretive details like "largest bottleneck" and "by 3 days" vs. direct reference to "3-day SLA", and slight rewording for structure preservation), plus a negligible unified diff formatting discrepancy (missing closing @@), warranting a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
