5.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (Count of “Manual Fraud Check”)**: Correct (exactly once, in Case 1002). Matches ground truth precisely in fact, though phrasing is more verbose. Full credit here.
- **Part 2 (Explanation of Misestimation)**: Word count compliant (≈85 words). Covers small sample and potential over/underestimation generically, which aligns partially with ground truth's sampling error theme. However, significant omissions include: quantitative details (14 events, 3 cases, <2-hour span, 0%-7% swing), wide confidence interval for rare events, and crucially, the near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) causing string-matching distortions— a key data-specific point in ground truth. Introduces mild speculation (“higher volumes later in the month”), violating "no speculation" policy. These gaps and imprecisions (lacking rigor on sampling bias/fuzzy matching) warrant major deduction under strict criteria, reducing this section to ~3/10 equivalent. Overall average yields 5.5.
