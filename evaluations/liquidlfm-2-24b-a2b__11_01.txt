2.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Ranking Error (Major Deduction: -5.0 points)**: Prompt requires ranking **#1 (worst) → #3 strictly by waiting-time**. Table shows Request_Documents (avg 36.5h, p95 120.0h) as #1, Send_Closure_Letter (12.2h, 44.0h) as #2, Assess_Liability (7.8h, 16.4h) as #3. LLM swaps #1/#2, incorrectly labeling Send_Closure_Letter as worst. This violates core prompt ("identifies the three worst... ranks them #1 (worst)").
- **Numbers Quoted Verbatim**: Correct (+1.0 partial), matches table exactly.
- **Activities Only These Three, No Extras**: Compliant (+1.0).
- **Actions**: Concrete and promise ≥20% implicitly/explicitly, logically tied to waiting (e.g., automation for handoffs). However, not explicitly "data-driven" like ground truth (no pilots/estimates cited), and differ completely (+0.5 partial).
- **Format/Length**: Memo-style under 150 words, but adds unwarranted elements (subject, date, signature, intro/conclusion) vs. ground truth's terse list. Crisp but diverges significantly.
- **Overall Differences from Ground Truth**: Swapped ranking, different actions, expanded format = substantial mismatch. Strict policy: significant loss for errors. Base 10 → 2.0.
