8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in comprehensively covering the core elements of the prompt: it identifies three key decision points aligned with the process flow (eligibility triage, amount-based branching, and pre-approval/payment gating) and lists all seven required documents exactly as defined in the ground truth, without introducing extras. Descriptions are accurate and tied to the process description, and it avoids mentioning undefined activities (e.g., no legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide").

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Decision points**: The content is mostly accurate but lacks precision in several small ways, warranting deductions. Point 1 correctly infers the triage as a decision but calls it "implicit" and omits the explicit rejection outcome ("Not eligible → claim rejected/returned") from the ground truth, instead vaguely stating "to proceed." Point 2 matches closely but slightly rephrases the timing ("after the Finance Controller has given the pre-approval" vs. ground truth's "after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**"). Point 3 overlaps with ground truth's #3 but frames it more as a constraint recap than a distinct "final payment approval" with clear "Approved → payment; Rejected → ends" branches, and it doesn't explicitly reference the combined "Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review" locus. The narrative format (vs. ground truth's structured table with numbered logic) reduces clarity. These are small interpretive liberties and omissions of explicit branching/rejection paths, leading to a ~1.5 point loss.
- **Documents list**: Identical in completeness and items (including the conditional note on AuditTrail), with added contextual descriptions that are faithful but not required by the prompt—minor bloat, no deduction needed.
- No major errors (e.g., no inventions), but the strict criteria for "differences" and "small errors" prevent a perfect score. Overall fidelity is high (~85% match), justifying 8.5.
