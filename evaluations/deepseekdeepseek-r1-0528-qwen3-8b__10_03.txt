3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +1.0)**: The LLM correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exclusively in the table and introductory text, with no leaks of disallowed synonyms (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", "Sanctions Check", or "risk rating"). This adheres to the strict policy, but the introductory explanation is extraneous and not required by the prompt.
- **Matrix Structure and Completeness (Severe Deduction, -4.0)**: The prompt demands a Markdown table covering **every activity** described in the narrative without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM only includes 4 activities, omitting two explicit ones ("Compliance Officer Approval" for escalation/approval and "Release Funds" for scheduling/releasing/notifying). This is a critical failure to cover the full process, leading to an incomplete matrix.
- **RACI Assignments (Major Inaccuracies, -2.5)**: Assignments deviate significantly from the ground truth across all rows:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM incorrectly marks Compliance Analyst, Compliance Officer, and Treasury Ops as "Informed (I)"; ground truth has Compliance Analyst as "C", Officer as "–", and no "I" for Officer.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: LLM over-assigns "Responsible/Accountable (RA)" to Compliance Analyst and "I" to others; ground truth specifies "R, A" for Compliance Analyst, "C" for Officer, and "–" or "I" selectively (no broad "I").
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM incorrectly adds "I" for Front-Office and "NC/NI" for Treasury Ops; ground truth has Front-Office as "C", Compliance Analyst as "R", Officer as "A", and Treasury Ops as "I".
  - No coverage of missed activities means zero accuracy there.
- **Formatting and Style (Minor Deduction, -0.5)**: The table is Markdown but uses full phrases like "Responsible (R)" instead of ground truth's concise "**R, A**" with bolding for primary roles. Introduces non-standard "RA", "NC", "NI", and a dash only in headers (not for no involvement). Extra pre-table text violates the prompt's implication of a direct table return.
- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost strictness, small errors (e.g., non-standard abbreviations) compound the major ones (incompleteness, wrong inferences). The LLM shows awareness of vocabulary but fails on core requirements, yielding a low score. Base of 10 minus deductions = 3.5.
