3.0

The LLM answer demonstrates partial compliance with the instructions but falls significantly short of the ground truth in multiple respects:

**POSITIVE**  
- It uses only the authorized vocabulary (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”).
- No forbidden synonyms/alternative phrasings are present.

**NEGATIVE/DEFICITS**  
- **Activities Missing**: The matrix omits “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”, both explicitly required and present in the process narrative and the ground truth. This is a major deficiency.
- **Activity Naming**: The ground truth uses “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds” as distinct activities (required by the prompt: “do not rename, merge, or add activities”), but these are absent in the answer’s table.
- **RACI Assignment Deficiencies**:  
  - The assignment of roles and responsibilities strongly diverges from the ground truth. For example:
    - “Intake Vetting” wrongly assigns “Informed” to all roles but the Front-Office Analyst, who is only “Responsible”—missing “Accountable”, and fails to provide “Consulted” to Compliance Analyst as in truth.
    - For most activities, “Accountable” and “Responsible” are merged with “RA”, not clearly serving “R, A” when applicable.
    - “Consulted” assignments are missing throughout.
    - “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds” are not mapped at all.
  - Use of “Not Consulted (NC) or Not Informed (NI)” is inappropriate and not part of standard RACI notation, nor present in the prompt or ground truth.

- **Formatting**:  
  - The matrix is not as comprehensive—fewer rows/activities than required.
  - The “Accountable/Responsible (RA)” notation is confusing and not in line with the explicit “R, A” style in the ground truth.

**SUMMARY**:  
- The LLM followed the vocabulary rules but did not "cover every activity" or match RACI assignments with required precision. It loses significant marks for structural incompleteness, misassignment, and omission of required rows.

**Penalty Rationale**:  
- Major process activities missing (at least -3 points each).
- RACI assignments wrong or unclear (further -2).
- Improper notation and missing explicitness (a further -1).
- Thus: 10 - (3+3+2+1) = 1, but it did use the vocabulary right, which spares it from the absolute minimum; thus, 3.0 is strictly justified.
