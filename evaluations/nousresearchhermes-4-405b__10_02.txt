The LLM answer has significant deviations from the ground truth, outlined below:

**Major Issues:**

1. **Missing Role**: The "Operations Manager" role is not present at all in the LLM answer, which is a direct omission compared to the ground truth.

2. **Incorrect RACI Assignments**:
   - **Accountability ("A")**: The ground truth consistently assigns "A" to Operations Manager, but the LLM assigns "A" to Regulatory Liaison on several tasks, and sometimes combines "R/A", which is improper for RACI.
   - Many "I" and "C" assignments do not match ground truth.

3. **Mandated Wording / Task Names**:
   - The LLM sometimes uses source-language ("Log transfer instruction", "Screen payment against sanctions list") instead of rephrasing to the precise mandated terms.
   - The ground truth uses "Receive Payment Instruction", "Screen Against Sanctions List", "Archive Record", while the LLM sometimes deviates ("Log transfer instruction", "Screen payment against sanctions list", "Archive case file").

4. **Extra/Unmapped Activities**:
   - The LLM adds "Ensure SWIFT message is sent", which, while implied, is not exactly as mapped in the ground truth.

5. **KYC Review**:
   - The LLM uses "Perform KYC Review", but does not have the same RACI mapping as ground truth (e.g., "C" for Transaction Analyst missing, and incorrect "R/A" assignment).

6. **Table Formatting**:
   - The LLM omits the Operations Manager column, misaligns RACI assignments, and leaves empty cells that are explicitly accounted for in the ground truth.

**Positives:**
- The correct mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") is used throughout for the roles and the one activity requiring it.
- Markdown table formatting and a RACI legend are present.

**Conclusion**: Major errors include omission of a critical role, inaccurate or missing role assignments, use of non-mandated terms in some task names, and failing to map strictly to the steps and allocations in the ground truth. The LLM answer demonstrates awareness of key requirements but fails in precise implementation and strict adherence.
