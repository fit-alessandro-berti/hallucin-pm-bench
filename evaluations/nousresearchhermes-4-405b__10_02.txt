The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt by using the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") correctly and producing a Markdown RACI table that covers the source steps without omissions. However, it deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Structural differences**: Missing the "Operations Manager" column, which is present in the ground truth as a key role (Accountable for nearly all tasks). Includes an extra row ("Ensure SWIFT message is sent") not in the ground truth, splitting what the ground truth combines into "Release Payment."
- **Task wording inconsistencies**: Phrasings like "Log transfer instruction" (vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"), "Perform KYC Review (sender and beneficiary)" (vs. "**KYC Review**"), "Archive case file" (vs. "Archive Record"), and the added SWIFT task introduce variations and extras not matching the ground truth's mandated, concise wording.
- **RACI assignments**: Major mismatches across all rows, altering responsibilities, accountabilities, consultations, and notifications (e.g., ground truth assigns "A" to Operations Manager universally, "R" to Regulatory Liaison for KYC/approval with "C" to Transaction Analyst; LLM incorrectly combines "R/A" under Regulatory Liaison, omits Operations Manager entirely, and misses "I" for IT Support in several places). No bolding on key R/A cells as in ground truth.
- **Extra content**: Includes a "Key notes per task" section with explanations not present in the ground truth, which only has a legend and a brief closing note. This adds unrequested elaboration.
- **Overall fidelity**: While the table is clear and Markdown-formatted, the core RACI logic and role mappings fail to align with the ground truth's structure and assignments, treating compliance tasks differently and ignoring the implied oversight role. These are not minor errors but fundamental deviations, each contributing to substantial point loss.
