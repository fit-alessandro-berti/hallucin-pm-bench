**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it wrongly concludes "No" (impossible) and provides a flawed explanation that ignores the shortcut T2b (which enables pd without pc/T3) and the feedback T6 (which enables pc/T3 *after* T5). This directly contradicts the ground truth's "Yes" with explicit shortest sequence 〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉, which is feasible per the net. No partial credit for partial dependency mentions, as the core claim, sequence request, and reasoning are entirely reversed/wrong under strict evaluation.
