4.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt and vocabulary policy but incurs significant deductions for multiple violations and deviations from the ground truth. Key issues, evaluated with utmost strictness:

- **Vocabulary Compliance (Minor Credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses the four mandated terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "Sanctions Check"). No deductions here, but this is baseline compliance.

- **Structure and Activities (Major Deductions, -4.0)**: 
  - Adds unauthorized activities ("Approval (if escalated)", "Payment Scheduling", "Notification"), violating "do not ... add activities." Ground truth limits to six precisely derived activities; LLM expands to eight, introducing extraneous steps (e.g., "Payment Scheduling" and "Notification" are not distinct in the narrative or ground truth).
  - Renames activities inconsistently: "Approval (if escalated)" vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Fund Release" vs. "Release Funds." This breaches "do not rename" and mismatches ground truth phrasing.
  - Merges/splits incorrectly: Narrative's "releases the funds and notifies" is consolidated in ground truth as "Release Funds," but LLM splits and adds, altering the process coverage.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deductions, -3.5)**: Numerous cell-level errors, even small ones costing points per strictness rule:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Missing "A" for Front-Office Analyst (ground: **R, A**); incorrectly assigns "Informed" to Compliance Analyst, Officer, and Treasury Ops (ground: C for Compliance, – for Officer, I for Treasury).
  - **KYC Review & AML Screening**: Missing "A" for Compliance Analyst (ground: **R, A**); otherwise partial match but incomplete.
  - **Risk Scoring**: Major mismatch—ground assigns C to Front-Office, R to Compliance, **A** to Officer, I to Treasury; LLM wrongly gives R only to Compliance, "Informed" to all others (no C/A distinctions).
  - **Approval**: Partial match but missing "A" for Officer (ground: **R, A**); assigns "Informed" to Treasury Ops (ground: –).
  - **Release Funds**: LLM's "Fund Release" partially aligns (all "Informed" except Treasury "Responsible"), but ground has C for Compliance and Officer (not "Informed"), **R, A** for Treasury, and I for Front-Office—multiple cell errors.
  - Extraneous rows ("Payment Scheduling", "Notification") have no ground truth equivalents, amplifying irrelevance.
  - No use of combined "R, A" or "–" for no involvement; spells out terms (e.g., "Responsible" vs. "R"), reducing compactness and deviating from ground truth format. Uses "Informed" universally where ground uses "–" or nuanced roles.

- **Format and Completeness (Minor Deductions, -0.5)**: Markdown table is present, but lacks ground truth's bolding (** for activities/RA), abbreviations (R, A, C, I, –), and exact column headers (e.g., no spaces in ground truth headers). Covers all roles but inflates with extras. No explanatory notes beyond the matrix, but prompt doesn't require them.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt/Ground Truth (-1.8 Cumulative)**: Covers "every activity" but exceeds by adding/renaming, failing "do not rename, merge, or add." Partial intent match (e.g., escalation and release implied), but strict comparison shows ~60% cell/row divergence. No criminal/jailbreak issues, but evaluation focuses on accuracy.

Total: Starts at 10.0 baseline, deducts to 4.2 for cumulative errors. This is not a passing score; the answer is functional but unreliable for governance use due to inaccuracies and expansions.
