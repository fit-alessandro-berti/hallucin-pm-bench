5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates strict adherence to the required vocabulary—only the four authorized activity names are used (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring), and no prohibited synonyms or alternative phrasings appear. However, there are several notable deviations from the Ground Truth Answer:

**Major issues:**
- The LLM includes extra activities ("Approval (if escalated)", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Notification"), which is not allowed per the instruction "do not rename, merge, or add activities." This is a major error.
- The activity "Compliance Officer Approval" is renamed as "Approval (if escalated)", which is a deviation.
- "Release Funds" is renamed as "Fund Release", and "Notification" is added, which is not present in the ground truth.

**Minor/Moderate issues:**
- The role assignments (Responsible, Accountable, etc.) at several activities do not match the Ground Truth matrix. For example:
  - Intake Vetting: In ground truth, Front-Office Analyst is R, A, while in the LLM answer, only "Responsible" is assigned (missing "Accountable").
  - KYC Review, AML Screening: LLM makes Compliance Analyst only "Responsible" but not "Accountable"; in ground truth it's "R, A".
  - Risk Scoring: In ground truth, Compliance Analyst is R, Compliance Officer is A, but LLM puts only "Responsible" on Compliance Analyst and "Consulted" on Compliance Officer.
  - No use of "R, A" to indicate dual responsibility/accountability as per ground truth.

- The notation for roles is also inconsistent: the ground truth has "R, A" in a cell, but the LLM answer splits them up and in some cases omits "Accountable" designation, or doesn’t specify both.

**Positive points:**
- The required vocabulary is strictly observed for the four activity names (no synonym leakage).
- The table structure is correct and comprehensible.

**Conclusion:**
A score of 5.0 reflects that while vocabulary usage is strong, there is a critical failure on activity fidelity and role assignment per instructions, as well as activity naming—fundamentally undercutting the requirement for strictness and penalizing the inclusion of unauthorized activities. With utmost strictness, these deficiencies warrant a significant point deduction.
