**1.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Line-by-Line Assessment vs. Ground Truth):
- **Q1/A1**: Ground truth: **3**. LLM partially lists C001/C002/C003 (implies 3) but explicitly states "2" later and fails to provide just the number. **Major error (wrong number stated)** → Full deduction.
- **Q2/A2**: Ground truth: `Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`. LLM fabricates `Ship_Order → Check_Stock → Check_Stock → Ship_Order` (wrong order, missing `Receive_Order`/`Arrange_Delivery`, hallucinates duplicate `Check_Stock`, starts with non-existent `Ship_Order`). Repeated in extra text. **Total hallucination** → Full deduction.
- **Q3/A3**: Ground truth: `- Arrange_Delivery<br>- Check_Stock` (alphabetized, one per line, exact). LLM: `Arranged_Delivery, Check_Stock, Ship_Order` (wrong spelling `Arranged_` vs. `Arrange_`, hallucinates `Ship_Order` as predecessor to itself, wrong format/commas/semicolons, not one-per-line). **Multiple fabrications + format failure** → Full deduction.

Overall: 0/3 correct (hallucinations, inconsistencies, format violations everywhere). No partial credit under utmost strictness.
