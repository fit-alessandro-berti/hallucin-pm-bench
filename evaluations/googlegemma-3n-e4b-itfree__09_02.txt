The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of calculation due to missing timestamps and adheres to the prompt's requirement for a single concise explanatory sentence. However, it loses a minor point for slightly less detail compared to the ground truth, which explicitly references the absence of duration information, reliance on event counts, and the specific need for start-to-completion intervalsâ€”omitting these nuances slightly reduces precision under strict evaluation criteria.
