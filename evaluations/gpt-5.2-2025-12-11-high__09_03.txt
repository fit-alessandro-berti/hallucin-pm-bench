The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in core reasoning (impossibility due to redacted event rows and timestamps in Artefact A, inability to compute metrics for "Approve Invoice"), structure (one concise paragraph explaining precisely why), and adherence to instructions (no guesses, plain text, addresses all tasks). Minor deductions for: (1) slightly greater length/verbosity than the "short paragraph" ideal (e.g., elaborates on exact data needs like "per-occurrence timestamps" and "number of observations," and explicitly dismisses SLA B with an example—accurate but not in ground truth); (2) subtle phrasing differences (e.g., "I cannot compute... from the supplied artefacts" vs. "Impossible — the necessary data are absent"; "standard deviation... confidence interval" vs. "dispersion or confidence interval," where "dispersion" is less precise to prompt's "standard deviation"). No factual errors, but strictness penalizes non-identical wording and extra detail as deviations.
