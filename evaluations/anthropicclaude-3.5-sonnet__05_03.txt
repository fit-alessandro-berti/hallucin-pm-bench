- The answer correctly adds a boundary timer to "Create Account" linked to the unused AM Review user task, thus enforcing the SLA without creating new activities.
- Missing Details & Penalties:
  - The boundary event in the LLM answer is missing the explicit attribute `cancelActivity="true"`, which makes it unambiguously interrupting. This is essential for compliance and subtly distinct from the default behavior (significant penalty).
  - The timer duration is specified as `P2D` rather than `PT48H` with `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"`, which is less precise for BPMN 2.0 XML (notably, the default duration format should be exactly as shown in the ground truth, so this is a clear error).
  - The boundary event is missing a `name` attribute, which, while optional, is present in the ground truth and aids clarity/documentation.
  - The justification is correct in intention but not as precise/formal as the ground truth.
  - The LLM answer omits explicit mention of the XML namespace for the timer's duration (`xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"`), which is a standards-level omission.
- Overall, the answer is substantially correct in method and outcome, but precise XML and standards requirements are not fully met. These errors are significant given BPMN strictness.
