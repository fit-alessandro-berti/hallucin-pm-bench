9.0

**Evaluation:**

1. **Question 1:** Correct⁠—the answer is "1".  
2. **Question 2:** Correct calculation of 5.56%. Correct rounding and formula.  
3. **Question 3:** Correct—only A1002 contains "Manual_Fraud_Check".  
4. **Question 4:**  
   - "Small sample size": Acceptable; captures the sample volume point.  
   - "Limited case diversity": This is **not** as strong or precise as "temporal bias", "case-mix bias", or "survivorship/truncation bias"; it's a bit ambiguous. While the explanation gets close to "case-mix bias", it doesn't address temporal or survivorship biases.  
   - The answer does **not** incorrectly infer or hallucinate information, and every claim is supported by the data.

**Point deduction:**  
- The second sampling-related reason ("limited case diversity") is imprecise compared to the provided "case-mix bias", "temporal bias", and "survivorship/truncation bias". Strictly, the loss of just a fraction of a point is justified for not being fully aligned with the more specific biases listed in the ground truth, but the answer is valid and not incorrect.

**Conclusion:**  
- This is a strong, correct answer with minor phrasing imprecision on the sampling bias part.

**Final Score:** 9.0
