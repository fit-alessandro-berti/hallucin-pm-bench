8.5

The LLM answer is accurate and thorough in its reasoning:  
- It correctly answers "No."  
- It identifies, for each relevant case, the activity sequences and explicitly notes which cases violate the rule (C002 and C004), with clear reference to the interleaving activities.
- The justification is precise, mentioning for each cited case what sequence occurs, and why this invalidates the FACT.

However, compared to the ground truth, the LLM answer has minor shortcomings:
- It did not present the information in a tabular/case-by-case format, which would have improved clarity and direct comparison.
- The LLM could have been more explicit in indicating that, for each log entry, it checked the immediate succession (the "immediate successor" notion is made more explicit in the ground truth).
- Although it referenced all the correct data, the answer could have benefited from more systematic formatting for rigor.

Given these relatively small omissions (mainly in format and explicitness, without factual inaccuracies), a score of 8.5 reflects significant loss for strictness, but acknowledges the core correctness and thoroughness of the analysis.
