The LLM answer is factually accurate and fully aligns with the ground truth in structure (Yes/No response followed by justification citing all relevant CaseIDs and sequences), content (correctly identifies compliant cases C001/C003 and violations in C002/C004 with precise intervening activities), and conclusion (rejects the "always" claim due to counterexamples). It covers the required elements without errors or omissions. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's tabular format and explicit case-count summary, which adds visual clarity but does not alter the substantive fidelity.
