The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth for questions 1 and 2 (a/b), with exact matches on counts, calculations, and rounding—full credit there. For question 3, the response is concise (68 words), covers variance/instability (e.g., "skewed," "overfitting," "unreliable rules"), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "distort conclusions when generalised," "not statistically representative"). However, it deducts points for not explicitly mentioning the "single-occurrence" issue in the explanation (ground truth requires this; LLM implies rarity but omits direct reference like "appears only once," relying on Q1 tie-in, a minor but notable gap under strict criteria).
