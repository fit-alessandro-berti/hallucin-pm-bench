The LLM answer is highly accurate and functionally equivalent to the ground truth, correctly adding a boundary timer event on the target task with a valid 48-hour duration, routing to the existing unused escalation activity, and providing a concise one-sentence justification; minor deductions for not explicitly specifying `cancelActivity="true"` (though default), using a slightly verbose/redundant duration format (`P2DT0H0M0M0S` vs. cleaner `PT48H`), lacking a name attribute on the boundary event, and employing `tExpression` instead of `tFormalExpression` (both valid but less precise per schema conventions), but these do not alter compliance or correctness.
