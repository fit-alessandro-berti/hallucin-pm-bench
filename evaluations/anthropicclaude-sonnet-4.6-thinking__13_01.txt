**10.0**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data:
- Q1: Exact match ("1" occurrence).
- Q2: Exact match (5.56%, with correct calculation shown).
- Q3: Exact match (only A1002); added timestamp is directly from the log (no inference).
- Q4: Exact match (provides two clear, correct reasons from the allowed set: small sample size with variance quantification matching ground truth example; temporal bias with accurate log-derived details like single day/morning window).

No hallucinations, deviations, or ungrounded inferences. Formatting enhances clarity without altering facts. Perfect under strict evaluation.
