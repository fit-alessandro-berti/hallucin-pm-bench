**8.5**

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies **all** required changes with perfect accuracy on content: 
- Added tasks: exactly the 3 correct ones (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject).
- Removed tasks: exactly the 1 correct one (Task_RejectLoan).
- Gateway-type changes: correctly notes the change for Gateway_Decision from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway.

No extraneous changes listed, renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name) correctly ignored, no other errors or omissions.

**Penalties applied (utmost strictness for any differences):**
- **Format mismatches (-0.5)**: Headings use `###` instead of `* **Bold**`; bulleted lists (`*`) instead of numbered (`1.`, `2.`, etc.).
- **Presentation of tasks (-0.5)**: ID bolded first with name in `""` vs. name bolded first with ID in `` ` `` (reversed emphasis, different markup; applied once for consistency across sections).
- **Gateway phrasing (-0.3)**: Verbose/full BPMN terms + XML tags ("**Exclusive Gateway** (exclusiveGateway)") vs. concise semantic notation ("**exclusive** (XOR)") with explicit *v1*/*v2* references.
- **Minor omissions (-0.2)**: No final confirmatory note ("*(No other...)*"); no escaped `_` in "Gateway_Decision".

Semantically identical and fully responsive to prompt, but stylistic/presentation differences warrant deductions per strict criteria.
