The LLM answer is nearly perfect, with exact matches on questions 1-3 and appropriately reasoned responses for question 4 that align directly with the ground truth's acceptable criteria (small sample size and temporal bias, stated clearly without hallucination or unjustified inference). Minor formatting differences (e.g., space in percentage symbol) do not warrant deduction under strict evaluation, as core content and accuracy are flawless.
