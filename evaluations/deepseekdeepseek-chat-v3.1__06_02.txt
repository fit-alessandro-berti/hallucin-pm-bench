The LLM answer correctly identifies and enumerates all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task matches to the ground truth, adhering to the prompt's requirements of focusing solely on concurrent tasks, using numbered lines, and comma-separated lists. The only minor deviation is the addition of a brief introductory sentence ("Of course. Here are the sets of tasks from Process B that can execute concurrently:"), which slightly exceeds the instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" by including unnecessary preamble. Additionally, single spaces follow commas in the LLM answer, while the ground truth uses double spaces, but this is a negligible formatting inconsistency. Under utmost strictness, this results in a small deduction, but the core response is highly accurate and complete.
