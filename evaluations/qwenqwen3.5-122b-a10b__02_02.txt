**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually precise and fully matches the ground truth in content, sequence, distinct elements, ordering, and separators:

- **Q1/A1**: Exact match ("3").
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"); ground truth escaping (`\_`) is an artifact of its markdown table format, not required by the prompt/log.
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery" then "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered (A before C). Prompt requires no dashes or `<br>` (HTML artifacts in ground truth); LLM format complies precisely with "one per line".

No extras, omissions, fabrications, or errors. Perfect adherence.
