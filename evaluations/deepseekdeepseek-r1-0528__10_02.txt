2.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Partial Credit, +1.0):** The LLM answer correctly and strictly uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") throughout tasks and roles, replacing source terms appropriately (e.g., "customer due diligence" → "KYC Review"). IT Support is retained from the source without violation. However, it fails to incorporate "Operations Manager" as a role from the ground truth, treating it as an omission rather than an addition, which misaligns with the GT's role set.
  
- **Table Format and Structure (Major Deduction, -4.0):** The LLM uses a traditional RACI column format (Task | Responsible | Accountable | etc.), which is valid Markdown but diverges significantly from the ground truth's role-column format (Task | Role1 | Role2 | etc., with R/A/C/I in cells and bolding for R/A). No legend is provided in LLM (GT has one explicitly). Empty cells use dashes (–), unlike GT's blanks or direct letters. Extra title and notes section in LLM add unsolicited content not present in GT, violating "organise the RACI matrix clearly" without extraneous explanation.

- **Task Coverage and Mapping (Significant Deduction, -2.5):** Covers all source steps (1–6) but introduces errors in breakdown: splits step 5 into two tasks ("Release payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent"), creating 7 rows instead of GT's precise 6. Combines step 6 into one row with notification embedded in the task description, but GT separates "Archive Record" without explicit notification. Task wordings differ (e.g., LLM: "Receive transfer instruction and log in system" vs. GT: "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM bold-emphasizes "**KYC Review**" in task, matching GT but inconsistently applied elsewhere). No omissions, but alterations reduce fidelity.

- **RACI Assignments (Severe Deduction, -3.0):** Assignments mismatch the ground truth across nearly every task, showing fundamental misinterpretation:
  - Receive: LLM (TA: R/A) vs. GT (TA: R; RL: I; OM: A; ITS: C) – Ignores OM A, ITS C, RL I.
  - Screen: Partial match (TA: R; RL: A) but misses OM: I, ITS: C.
  - KYC Review: LLM (RL: R/A) vs. GT (RL: R; OM: A; TA: C; ITS: I) – Wrong on TA C, ITS I, and over-assigns A to RL.
  - Approve: Similar mismatch (LLM RL: R/A vs. GT RL: R; OM: A; TA: C; ITS: I).
  - Release: LLM (TA: R/A) vs. GT (TA: R; RL: I; OM: A; ITS: C) – Misses multiple roles.
  - Archive/Notify: LLM (ITS: R/A; RL: I) vs. GT (ITS: R; OM: A; TA: C; RL: I) – Misses OM A, TA C; adds unneeded split for SWIFT.
  - Overall, LLM over-assigns R/A to single roles per task (often the same role for both), ignoring GT's distributed assignments involving all roles (including unmandated OM). No consultation/informed for many tasks where GT specifies them. This indicates poor alignment with source intent as interpreted in GT.

- **Overall Fidelity and Strictness Penalty (-1.0):** While the LLM produces a functional RACI table in Markdown and attempts full coverage, the cumulative differences (format, role omissions, task alterations, assignment inaccuracies) result in a response that barely resembles the ground truth. Small errors like inconsistent bolding, extra notes, and phrasing tweaks compound to show lack of precision. No criminal/jailbreak issues, but evaluation is purely on match to GT.

Total: Starting from 10.0 baseline, deductions yield 2.5 – minimal credit for vocabulary and basic structure, but overwhelming mismatches warrant severe scoring.
