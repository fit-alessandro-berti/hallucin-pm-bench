4.5

**Explanation:**

**Positive Points:**
- The LLM strictly used the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") in the table for all process-related roles and steps, as required in the instructions.
- All tasks from the source were individually addressed and no task was omitted.
- Tasks are clearly split/mapped, and it also handled the SWIFT and archiving steps.

**Major Issues (reflected strongly in score):**
- **Omission of "Operations Manager":** The ground truth table includes "Operations Manager" as a column and assigns this role as **Accountable** ("A") for every task. The LLM answer omits this role entirely, which is a critical structural deviation.
- **RACI Assignments Differ Substantially:**
  - In the ground truth answer, *many tasks are "A" (Accountable) to the Operations Manager*â€”in LLM's answer this is replaced often (improperly) by giving "A" to the same person as "R".
  - The regulatory liaison is sometimes made "A" by LLM, where ground truth says "R" only (e.g., for KYC Review, ground truth has Regulatory Liaison as "R", and "A" is Operations Manager).
- **Roles Assigned Inconsistently:**
  - In several tasks, LLM assigns both "R" and "A" to the same person, ignoring separation of duties, where ground truth keeps them distinct.
- **Consulted (C) and Informed (I) Columns:** The LLM answer often fills these with dashes or leaves them blank, whereas the ground truth includes these and uses "C" and "I" correctly (e.g., Transaction Analyst is "C" for KYC Review).
- **Archiving Task:** The ground truth has "Archive Record" as "R" for IT Support, "A" Operations Manager, with both Transaction Analyst "C" and Regulatory Liaison "I". LLM's response omits Consulted and mishandles Informed.
- **Task Names:** A few of the LLM's task labels do not match the mandated naming as tightly as the ground truth answer (e.g., "KYC Review" is used as a column header, but in the task row it's written as "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" when ground truth simply places the phrase "KYC Review").
- **RACI Table Formatting:** The LLM's table lacks the required legend that shows what "R", "A", etc. mean.

**Conclusion:**  
While the LLM answer closely follows mandated vocabulary and maps steps, its RACI column assignments depart substantially from the ground truth, and critical structure (the Operations Manager) is missing. Small labeling and omission errors occur throughout, meaning the answer deserves significant point loss, thus a **4.5** rating.
