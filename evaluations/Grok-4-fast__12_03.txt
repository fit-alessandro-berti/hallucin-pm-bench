8.5

The LLM answer is accurate in its Yes/No assessment and clearly identifies the correct CaseIDs (C002 and C004) where the stated fact does not hold. The justification is concise and refers to the activity sequence as well as the relevant cases, echoing the logic in the ground truth answer. 

**Deductions:**
- The LLM answer gives a solid narrative justification but lacks a case-by-case structure (explicitly listing all cases and their sequences), which makes it slightly less comprehensive and clear than the ground truth answer.
- The LLM answer does not address the two cases C001 and C003 as specifically as the ground truth does, missing the explicit confirmation that in those two cases the condition does hold.

**Conclusion:**  
Correct answer and appropriate cited cases, but reduced clarity/completeness compared to the ground truth due to less structured justification and missing confirmation on the positive cases (C001, C003). Thus, 8.5/10.
