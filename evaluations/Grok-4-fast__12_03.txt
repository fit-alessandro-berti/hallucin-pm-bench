The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise, evidence-based justification by citing the exact counterexample sequences in C002 and C004, while acknowledging the cases (C001, C003) where it holdsâ€”directly aligning with the ground truth's core findings. It explicitly notes the universal failure ("does not hold universally"), matching the ground truth's conclusion. Minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's exhaustive case-by-case table format and quantitative summary ("two out of four"), though this does not impact factual accuracy or completeness of the required task (justification via relevant CaseIDs and sequences).
