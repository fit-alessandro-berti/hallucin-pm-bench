8.0

**Justification:**

- The LLM answer lists the decision points and required documents accurately and in the correct order, using the required terminology.
- The criteria for each decision point are almost a direct restatement of the ground truth with slight additional explanatory details, which, while not strictly wrong, slightly exceed the minimal summarising directive.
- The LLM answer gives correct document names and descriptions, matching the ground truth. Only a minor issue: describes “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” instead of just “Community Impact Statement (CIS)”, and adds the word “template”.
- One minor error: the answer does not explicitly state (as the ground truth does) the points at which the decision points occur (e.g., “branch after the Dual Underwriter Split”, “after Neighbourhood Feedback Check”).
- The brief note at the end of the ground truth about excluded/irrelevant documents is missing.

**Penalty breakdown:**
- -0.5 for not referencing the exact point in the flow where decisions happen.
- -0.3 for slight terminology drift on “CIS template”.
- -0.2 for not repeating the absence of standard loan documents.
- Otherwise, this is a faithful and mostly precise reproduction.

**Final score: 8.0**
