### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, closely mirroring the ground truth in identifying and describing the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) using exact terminology from the prompt. It correctly summarizes the criteria and escalation paths without introducing forbidden standard loan terms. The required documents list is complete and matches all six items, with no omissions or additions.

**Strengths (no deduction):**
- All decision points are correctly identified and sequenced in the process flow.
- Criteria details (e.g., ≤2 points difference, amount thresholds, board vote) are precise and use original phrasing like "Harmonisation Committee," "system auto-approves," and "MBA."
- Document list is exhaustive and uses exact names (e.g., "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet," "Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)").

**Deductions (total -0.8 points, reflecting strictness on small errors):**
- **Decision points structure/phrasing (-0.3):** Minor omissions of contextual positioning (e.g., ground truth specifies "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for Alignment Gate and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for Amount Threshold; LLM implies but does not state explicitly). Also, "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" uses lowercase "approve" or "reject" vs. ground truth's bolded/capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**" (-0.1 for formatting fidelity).
- **Amount Threshold phrasing (-0.2):** Uses "loan amount" instead of exact "amount" from the prompt/ground truth, introducing a subtle non-exact term.
- **Documents phrasing (-0.3):** Small wording variances: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)" (extra "old"); "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" (adds "single" and "or"); "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (adds "template"). These are trivial but deduct per strictness rule. No deduction for missing the ground truth's optional explanatory note, as it is not required by the prompt.
- No deduction for stylistic differences (e.g., "###" headers vs. "####", or level of detail in criteria), as they do not alter meaning or violate rules.

This score reflects near-perfect fidelity, with deductions only for the specified minor inaccuracies to enforce utmost strictness.
