8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes with exact IDs, names, and gateway type shifts matching the ground truth and BPMN XML diffs. No extras, omissions, or commentary added, fully adhering to instructions on verifiable differences only. However, under utmost strictness:

- Missing "-" bullets on all 5 list items (-1.0 total).
- Extra blank lines between sections (-0.3).
- Lacks alignment spaces on second gateway line ("Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" vs. "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel") (-0.2).

Content perfect (would be 10.0), but formatting diffs cause deduction.
