**4.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (≈7/10):** Identifies both correct decision points with nearly accurate rules. Minor deductions for: (1) phrasing deviations (e.g., "Step 4 (Conditional Branch)" vs. ground truth's "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; "€250,000 or less" vs. "≤ €250 000"; "provide approval" vs. "record 'Approve'"); (2) unnecessary step numbering and structure not matching ground truth format. Still functionally correct, but not verbatim-equivalent.
- **Part (b) - Documents (≈1/10):** Catastrophic omissions and errors. Lists only 5/9 documents; **entirely misses the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)**—explicit "Inputs" in Step 3, appearing second/third/fourth in ground truth order. Fails to distinguish **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (Step 8, separate first-appearance entry) from unsigned **Offer Sheet 77** (Step 7). Adds extraneous "(Appears in Step X)" annotations absent in ground truth. Order partially correct but invalidated by misses.
- **Overall:** Major failures in completeness/accuracy dominate (especially b)'s 4+ missing items); no hallucinations (good), but strict policy demands severe penalties for differences/omissions. Not a close match.
