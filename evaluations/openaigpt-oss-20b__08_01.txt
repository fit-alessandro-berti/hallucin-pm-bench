The LLM answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3, provides a valid and minimal firing sequence demonstrating this (up to the required point, without extraneous invalid steps like the ground truth's erroneous T4 firing), and offers a brief, accurate justification focused on the inhibitor arc condition at the key marking. The sequence markings are explicitly detailed and correct, enhancing clarity. Minor deductions for lacking the ground truth's deeper insight into the necessity ("must fire before T3") and permanent disablement post-T3, which provides additional analytical depth on enablement conditions, though this exceeds the prompt's minimal requirements for a "brief" justification. No factual errors or omissions in the core response.
