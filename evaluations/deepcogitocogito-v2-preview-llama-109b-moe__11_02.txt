7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Request_Documents/Review_Documents/Initial_Assessment), matching the ground truth exactly. It structures a concise memo (â‰ˆ180 words, under limit) with explanations and recommendations based strictly on table data, avoiding hallucinations or external activities. However, under strict evaluation:

- **Explanations (significant deductions, -1.5 points total)**: Omissions of key metrics reduce completeness. For Request_Documents, it misses the throughput drop (190 cases/day vs. upstream 280), a core "why" in ground truth. For Review_Documents, rework (5.3%) is absent from the issues list despite table data. For Initial_Assessment, processing time (12 min) and rework (1.8%) are omitted, weakening the bottleneck explanation (ground truth ties it to downstream congestion).

- **Recommendations (moderate deductions, -1.0 point)**: Actions are concrete and data-linked but less precise/measurable than ground truth. E.g., "deploy dedicated team and standardized templates" for Request_Documents is actionable but doesn't quantify impact (vs. ground truth's "cut queueing and halve rework"). Review_Documents' parallel processing ignores rework/variability; Initial_Assessment's redistribution is solid but lacks ground truth's triage specificity for low-risk routing.

- **Other (minor deductions, -0.5 point)**: Naming inconsistency ("Request Documents" vs. table's "Request_Documents") and lack of bolded metrics/projection for executive polish slightly dilute impact, though format is professional.

High alignment on core task (80% match), but strict rubric penalizes metric gaps and precision lapses, preventing a top score.
