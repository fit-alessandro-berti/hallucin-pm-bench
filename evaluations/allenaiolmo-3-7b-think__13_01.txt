9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict assessment against ground truth):
- **Q1**: Correct count (1). Minor deduction (-0.3) for unnecessary extra details (case/time), deviating from minimal "1 occurrence" ideal; reveals slight verbosity beyond strict log adherence.
- **Q2**: Exact match on value (5.56%), calculation, and rounding. No deduction.
- **Q3**: Exact match on case (A1002). Phrasing nearly identical ("Only case A1002"). No deduction.
- **Q4**: Both reasons valid and sampling-related. "Temporal Sampling Bias" perfectly aligns with "Temporal bias". "Non-Random Selection" aligns with "case-mix bias" but includes minor unjustified inference ("peak fraud-checking hours" – not derivable from log timestamps alone). Misses opportunity for "small sample size" quantification. Deduction (-0.5) for small inference/hallucination risk per policy.

**Overall**: Highly accurate (no factual errors, all directly from log), but strict penalties for minor extras/inferences reduce from 10.0. Total events/cases verified correct.
