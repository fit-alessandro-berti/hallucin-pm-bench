### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Full Credit)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere.
- **Structure and Format (Partial Credit, -1.5 points)**: The matrix has the correct activities as rows and roles as columns, with no extra tasks, roles, or columns introduced. However, it uses abbreviations (e.g., "AM" instead of full "Account Manager") and omits explicit "C" (Consulted) entries in the matrix despite mentioning it in the key (and incorrectly stating it's "not used"). The ground truth uses full role names and includes "C" where applicable. The added explanatory text and key are unwarranted, as the ground truth is purely the matrix.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, -4.5 points)**: Strict adherence to the process narrative is required, with exactly one Responsible (R) per activity and appropriate Accountable (A) assignments (mostly to Account Manager). The LLM fails significantly:
  - **Receive Application**: AM "R" vs. ground truth "R/A" (-0.5); CO "A" vs. "C" (-1.0, misses Consulted).
  - **KYC Review**: AM "I" vs. "A" (-0.5); FC "I" vs. "C" (-1.0, misses Consulted).
  - **Order Vetting**: AM "R" vs. "R/A" (-0.5); CO "A" vs. "C" (-1.0, misses Consulted).
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM "I" vs. "A" (-0.5); CO "I" vs. "C" (-1.0, misses Consulted).
  - **Record Update**: AM "I" vs. "C" (-0.5); FC "I" vs. "C" (-0.5, misses Consulted).
  - **Notify Customer**: AM "R" vs. "R/A" (-0.5).
  - Overall, every row has at least one mismatch, with systematic omission of "C" (present in 5/6 ground truth rows) and incomplete "R/A" dual roles (missed in 4 rows). This violates the narrative-derived allocations.
- **Overall Strictness**: Starting from 10.0, deductions reflect multiple per-row errors (even small ones like "R" vs. "R/A" or missing "C" count heavily). The core matrix intent is partially met (e.g., correct R for CO in KYC Review, FC in Payment Clearance, IT in Record Update), but pervasive inaccuracies make it unreliable. No self-awareness issues apply.
