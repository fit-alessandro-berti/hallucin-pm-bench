The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" compliance, pinpoints the exact Rule 3 violation (NA before RA), and assesses all rules accurately with solid reasoning matching the ground truth. Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly stating "once each" for Rule 1 (required by ruleset, stated in ground truth); (2) bullet format vs. ground truth table (less structured); (3) lacking explicit overall conclusion sentence. No factual errors, but strictness demands perfection in phrasing and format completeness.
