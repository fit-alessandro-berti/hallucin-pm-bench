The LLM answer is almost entirely correct and matches the ground truth in content and structure, adhering strictly to the three required headings and ignoring irrelevant changes.

However, there are extremely minor deviations that warrant a deduction. The LLM answer:

- Omits explanatory clarifications in the "Gateway-type changes" (e.g., does not specify "XOR"/"OR" in parentheses or mention v1/v2).
- Uses a slightly less formal heading/numbering style (bullet points instead of numerals).
- Does not precisely match the wording (e.g., says "changed from **Exclusive** to **Inclusive**" instead of clarifying "exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)" and explicitly mentioning in v1/v2 as in the ground truth).
- Slight difference in formatting (“Task_X” in code-style backticks in LLM answer matches the question request but uses bullet points for the main list).

These are minor, but as instructed, “even small errors should reflect in significant loss of points.”

Contentwise, there are no substantive omissions or factual inaccuracies.

**Score:** 9.0
