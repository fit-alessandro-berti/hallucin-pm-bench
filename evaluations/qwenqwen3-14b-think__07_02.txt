### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all substantive changes: three added tasks (with accurate IDs and names), one removed task, and the precise gateway type change from exclusive to inclusive. No extraneous changes are mentioned, aligning with the prompt's instruction to ignore cosmetics and focus strictly on the three headings.

However, under strict evaluation criteria, deductions are warranted for the following differences from the ground truth (each impacting clarity, precision, or format):
- **Formatting inconsistencies** (significant loss: -1.0): Uses bullet points instead of numbered lists; reverses order of task names and IDs (e.g., ID first vs. name first); inconsistent bolding (e.g., no bold on task names); headings use â€¢ and ** but not matching ground truth's * and structure.
- **Minor content omissions/details** (moderate loss: -0.5): Lacks explanatory abbreviations like "(XOR)" and "(OR)" for gateway types, which add precision in the ground truth. Does not specify versions (*v1* to *v2*). Missing the confirmatory note "(No other additions... are present.)".
- No major factual errors, but these small stylistic/precision gaps reduce perfection, as per instructions for strictness on even minor variances. Overall match: ~85%.
