The LLM answer is correct in substance: it accurately answers "Yes" to Q1, provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5), and offers a concise, valid explanation under the word limit that demonstrates T5 firing before T3 by consuming P2 without invoking T3. However, it lacks the ground truth's detailed markings (e.g., M‚ÇÅ = {P1, P2}) after each step, which provide explicit verification of reachability, and includes no brief rationale for Q1. This reduces completeness and pedagogical clarity, warranting a minor deduction despite no factual errors.
