**Evaluation:**

- **Q1:** Correct answer "Yes" with clear justification.
- **Q2:** Firing sequence matches exactly the minimal firing sequence in the ground truth: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.
- **Explanation:** The provided explanation details how T5 is enabled without T3 firing, which is accurate.

**Minor Issues and Point Deduction:**  
- The explanation in the LLM answer is slightly less formal and detailed than the ground truth, especially regarding marking notation and explaining that after T5 fires, T3 is subsequently disabled (which the ground truth states explicitly). The LLM does mention P2 being consumed but does not state the disabling of T3 as clearly.
- The ground truth provides explicit marking steps, which adds clarity.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is technically correct and demonstrates clear understanding. The only significant difference is a less formal explanation and the absence of stepwise markings, which results in a minor loss of precision and completeness. Thus, a deduction of 1 point is appropriate.
