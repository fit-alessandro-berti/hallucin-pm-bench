### Evaluation Explanation
- **Part (a) Assessment**: The LLM correctly identifies the two core decision points (the risk-based skip in Step 4 and the TriVote in Step 6) and describes their rules accurately in one sentence each, aligning closely with the ground truth phrasing (e.g., "Low or Medium AND ≤ €250,000" and "any two out of three suffice" matches "at least two... record 'Approve'"). However, it erroneously includes the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself (Step 3) as a third "decision point," which is not a gate or conditional branch but merely an input-generating step—the actual branch follows in Step 4. This inflation of decision points introduces an inaccuracy, violating the prompt's focus on "every decision point (gate or conditional branch)." Under strict evaluation, this extraneous inclusion deducts points significantly, as it misrepresents the process structure.

- **Part (b) Assessment**: The LLM lists 5 documents in correct first-appearance order among those it includes (Form 14B in Step 1, Deck Memo in Step 5, Offer Sheet 77 in Step 7, ID Matrix Declaration in Step 8, Loan Dossier 2025 in Step 9), with no hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML mentions). However, it critically omits the three Scorecard inputs (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicitly required as "Inputs" in Step 3 and thus first appear before the Deck Memo—representing a major incompleteness (missing ~33% of the ground truth list). Additionally, it fails to distinguish "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (first appearing in Step 8) as a separate required document from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" (Step 7), collapsing them implicitly and under-listing by one more item. These omissions are not minor; they directly contradict the prompt's requirement to list "**all** documents... in the order they first appear," leading to substantial point loss for incompleteness and imprecision.

Overall, while the response is structured and partially accurate, the errors—particularly the omissions in (b) and the extra/misclassified point in (a)—are significant under utmost strictness, warranting a mid-low score rather than passing. No credit for formatting or brevity, as fidelity to ground truth is paramount.
