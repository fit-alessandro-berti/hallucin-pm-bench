The LLM answer identifies no correct parallel pairs from Process B, instead fabricating invalid combinations (e.g., pairing sequential tasks like Fabricate with earlier ones like Procure_Materials, which cannot overlap). It omits both ground truth pairs entirely (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), violates the alphabetical ordering requirement by not sorting pairs correctly (e.g., mixes unrelated tasks without proper intra- or inter-pair alpha order), and includes extraneous, non-parallel pairs with no basis in the process description. This represents a complete misunderstanding of parallelism, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
