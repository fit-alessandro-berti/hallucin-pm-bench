3.0

The LLM answer shows multiple significant mistakes and deviations from the ground truth:

- The activities do NOT correspond precisely to the ones in the ground truth: "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" are missing, and "Treasury Ops" is incorrectly used as an activity (it's a role, not an activity).
- The matrix is laid out as Role × Activity, not Activity × Role, and omits activities. This is a fundamental misreading of the requirements.
- Responsibility assignments differ:
    - The LLM never uses R, A in the same cell, or C; job division and R/A granularity is missed.
    - For most activities, only a single R or A is given where the ground truth expects more precise breakdown (e.g. Intake Vetting should be R, A for Front-Office Analyst; LLM gives only Responsible).
- KYC Review and AML Screening: Accountable is missing from Compliance Analyst; "Responsible" is used instead.
- Risk Scoring: Accountable is wrongly assigned to Compliance Officer, with 'Responsible' instead assigned to Compliance Analyst, but not both where they should be.
- "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" activities are totally omitted, as are their respective RACI assignments.
- "Consulted" and "Informed" are inconsistently and incompletely assigned; only one Informed per row is presented, not as in the ground truth.
- No dash is used where there's no involvement.
- While the LLM avoided all disallowed synonyms and used the correct activity terms and role names, the structure and assignments are highly deficient.

These significant errors warrant a low score. However, using the required vocabulary correctly and avoiding synonyms means it is not a total failure (would not rate 1.0 or 2.0), so a 3.0 is appropriate for this submission.
