2.5

The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by correctly using "Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," and "Risk Scoring" without leaks of disallowed terms. However, it fails critically in multiple areas, warranting a low score under strict evaluation:

- **Structure and format mismatches**: The table transposes roles and activities (roles as rows vs. ground truth's activities as rows), violating the implied standard RACI format. It incorrectly treats "Treasury Ops" as an activity column instead of a role, adding unauthorized content.
- **Incomplete coverage**: It omits two essential activities from the narrative—"Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"—failing to "cover every activity described." Only four of six activities are addressed.
- **Incorrect RACI assignments**: Many entries are wrong or incomplete (e.g., Front-Office Analyst is only "Responsible" for Intake Vetting but misses "A"; Compliance Analyst is "Informed" for Intake Vetting instead of "C"; no entries for the missing activities; excessive blanks indicate poor coverage of roles like Consulted/Informed across all).
- **Overall fidelity**: The output captures ~40% of the ground truth's content accurately but introduces errors and omissions that fundamentally distort the matrix, leading to substantial point deduction for even these partial matches.
