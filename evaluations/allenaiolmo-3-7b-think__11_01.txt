9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 by avg waiting time correctly identified (Request_Documents 36.5h/120h, Send_Closure_Letter 12.2h/44h, Assess_Liability 7.8h/16.4h). Figures quoted verbatim. +10/10.
- **No unwarranted content**: Fully compliant—no service times, throughput, or extra activities mentioned. Headers/subject appropriate for "executive memo." Word count (130) ≤150. +10/10.
- **Action relevance & requirements**: Logically tied to waiting times (e.g., automation/prioritization targets queues/delays). Each promises ≥20% cut. Concrete suggestions (e.g., AI prioritization, email/SMS, decision tools). -0.8 total: Minor phrasing slip in #2 ("processing time" vs. explicit "waiting/queue time"—confuses with forbidden service-time discussion, though not quoted); actions data-driven via process snapshot implications but less specific/evidence-backed than ground truth (no "pilots"/"estimates").
- **Format & crispness**: Professional memo structure exceeds ground truth minimalism but aligns with "executive memo" prompt. Minor extras (closing sentence) non-violative.
- **Overall differences**: Core identical; variances in action wording/specificity/ground truth format deduct modestly under strictness (significant for small mismatches like phrasing). High fidelity justifies 9.2.
