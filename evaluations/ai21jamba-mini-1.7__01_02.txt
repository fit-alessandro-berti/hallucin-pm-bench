7.0

— The LLM answer captures decision points 1 (Underwriter Alignment Gate) and 2 (Amount Threshold Decision) accurately, using the correct terminology, and lists all the required documents as per the prompt and ground truth.

— However, the LLM omits the third explicit decision point: the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** as a decision point in its own list, though it briefly mentions "for a final decision" within Amount Threshold Decision. This is a significant omission: the user specifically asked for all decision points, and the prompt and ground truth both list MBA as a separate, final decision point.

— On documents: the LLM does include the full required set, using almost exactly the right wording (minor differences, e.g., "template" retained for CIS, versus ground truth just saying "CIS", very minor).

— The LLM answer does not add or introduce any standard loan terminology or process steps incorrectly (good).

— Minor issues: slightly ambiguous reference to **Amount Threshold Decision** feeding into MBA "for final decision" rather than calling it a discrete step; referencing "template" for CIS.

Due to the missing explicit listing of the "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)" as a standalone, highlighted decision point (a structural omission), and the small CIS template phrasing issue, 3 points are deducted for strictness. These are significant under the strict grading criteria.
