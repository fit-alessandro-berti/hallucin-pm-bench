### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major issues, ~60% of weight)**: The LLM correctly identifies the two main gates (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with accurate conditions and terminology, but omits the third critical decision point (Final Micro-loan Board Approval as an approve/reject vote). It also lacks contextual details from the ground truth, such as the position in the process flow (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") and precise phrasing (e.g., using "⇒" for flow, specifying underwriter names). This incompleteness and lack of precision warrant a significant deduction, as the ground truth treats MBA as an explicit decision point.
  
- **Required Documents (minor issues, ~40% of weight)**: The list is nearly complete and uses exact terminology without introducing standard loan terms. However, small phrasing deviations reduce accuracy: "≤ 3 months old" (vs. "≤ 3 months"), "single pay-stub or tax slip" (vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"), and "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" (vs. "Community Impact Statement (CIS)"). The omission of the ground truth's explanatory note (emphasizing no standard documents) is a minor but notable gap, as it reinforces the non-standard process.

Under utmost strictness, the missing decision point and phrasing inconsistencies prevent a higher score, but the core structure and adherence to activity names are strong enough to avoid a failing grade.
