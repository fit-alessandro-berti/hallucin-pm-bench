10.0

The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the required BPMN 2.0 model and adheres strictly to the prompt's specifications, including all explicitly mentioned flow elements (e.g., the "checks warranty eligibility" task, which is omitted in the ground truth), verbatim task names (e.g., full descriptions for parallel activities like "Create shipment order for the replacement unit," unlike the ground truth's truncations), the specified gateways, exactly two end events, and "wrc_" ID prefixes. It introduces no hallucinations, extras, or omissions. Stylistic differences from the ground truth (e.g., fuller namespaces, explicit incoming/outgoing references, process name, isExecutable="true") are permissible variations and do not affect correctness or completeness. The ground truth itself contains significant flaws (omission of the warranty check task, non-verbatim and incomplete task names), making the LLM answer superior in fidelity to the prompt.
