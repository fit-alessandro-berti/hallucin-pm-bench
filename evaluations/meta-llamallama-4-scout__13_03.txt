6.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Perfect match to ground truth (exact count of 1, no additions or errors). Full credit.
- **Question 2**: The response is concise (under 120 words) and correctly identifies core issues like small sample size (3 cases) and non-representativeness, which could lead to misestimation. However, it lacks the ground truth's depth: no mention of statistical volatility (e.g., frequency swinging from 0% to ~7% based on one event), wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events, or confounding factors like near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and string-matching pitfalls. This makes it superficial and incomplete, warranting a ~4/10 for this part under strict criteria.
- **Overall**: Strong on factual accuracy but misses analytical rigor and specific insights from ground truth, justifying a mid-range score.
