The LLM answer correctly identifies and enumerates all three parallel blocks from Process B exactly as described in the prompt: the two tasks in Parallel Block P1, the three in P2, and the three in P3. It adheres to the instructions by using numbered lines, comma-separated task lists, and excluding any sequential tasks or references to other processes. The only minor discrepancy is a missing space after the comma in the first line ("Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability" vs. ground truth's "Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability"), which is a small formatting inconsistency. All other lines match precisely in content and formatting, including spaces after commas. Under utmost strictness, this trivial whitespace error warrants a slight deduction, but the response is otherwise flawless in accuracy and completeness.
