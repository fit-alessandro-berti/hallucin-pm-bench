9.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly aligned with the ground truth and prompt requirements but incurs minor deductions under utmost strictness for the following differences (each reflecting ~0.2-0.3 point loss):

- **Identical strengths (full credit here)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment) as worst performers, based on clear table leaders in wait time (150/30/18 min), rework (22/5.3/1.8%), processing time (25 min for Review), SLA breaches (12.4/5.5/3.2%), stdev (9 min), and throughput drops. Explanations cite **only table data** without hallucination or absent activities. Memo format is executive-style, concise (~170 words <200), structured as 1-2-3 with explanations and one action each.

- **Small errors/differences causing deductions**:
  1. **Metric emphasis mismatches** (0.3 loss): LLM omits Review_Documents' 30-min wait (highlighted in GT) and Initial_Assessment's 12-min processing; conversely emphasizes stdev (9 min, valid but not in GT) and "third-highest SLA" phrasing. GT bolds key figures for precision; LLM embeds in prose.
  2. **Action specificity** (0.3 loss): All concrete/data-driven (e.g., checklist ties to 22% rework), but Initial_Assessment's is compound ("conduct analysis; implement triage *or* capacity *if*...") vs. GT's single direct actions (e.g., "triage rule-engine"). Less precise than GT's measurable phrasing (e.g., "cut queueing and halve rework").
  3. **Stylistic/closing variances** (0.2 loss): Fuller memo header good, but opening/closing less punchy than GT's ("data isolate hotspots"; specific projections). No table-strict violation, but diverges from GT's tone and bolding.

No major errors (e.g., wrong activities, fabrications); 92% match in substance justifies high score despite strict rubric.
