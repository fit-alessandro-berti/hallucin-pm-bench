The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can run in parallel, lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), uses the specified one-per-line format with appropriate spacing before the em dash (matching the example's "  — "), and ignores Process A. Deduction of 1.0 point for the unrequested introductory sentence (adding extraneous text not in ground truth output format) and minor non-alignment of the em dashes (ground truth uses extra padding spaces on the shorter second line for visual column alignment in monospace, which LLM lacks). No other errors; content and structure are otherwise a precise match to the core ground truth list.
