The LLM answer is strong overall, accurately identifying the three core decision points and listing all required documents without introducing extraneous terminology. However, it loses points for minor but notable deviations from the ground truth's precision and structure: (1) Decision points lack explicit references to process flow (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), exact outcomes (e.g., "system auto-approves" or "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval"), and full terminology (e.g., "Senior Underwriter A" and "Shadow Underwriter B" instead of abbreviated "Senior and Shadow Underwriter"); (2) The Final Micro-loan Board Approval omits the "(MBA)" acronym and uses inconsistent formatting (question form with italics vs. bolded **Approve**/**Reject**); (3) Required documents have small wording variances (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "CIS template" vs. "CIS"), and it omits the ground truth's clarifying note on excluded standard documents, which reinforces adherence to the non-standard process. These omissions and inconsistencies, while not major errors, reduce fidelity under strict evaluation criteria.
