5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates partial alignment with the requirements, but it exhibits several significant deviations from the ground truth and strict output policies:

**Vocabulary and Activity Naming**:
- The LLM consistently uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring")—this is correct.
- However, it introduces unauthorized activity names: "Escalation for approval", "Payment scheduling/Release", and "Notification of completion". This does not comply with the instruction to "not rename, merge, or add activities."
- It omits "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" as separate activities.

**Roles Assignment and RACI Notation**:
- Fails to follow the ground truth where "R, A" must be explicitly assigned when the same role is both responsible and accountable; the LLM outputs only one letter ("R" or "A") per cell, under-stating responsibility/accountability (e.g., Front-Office Analyst is not shown as both R and A for "Intake Vetting").
- Omits the dash (–) indicating "no involvement" as required.

**Matrix Coverage**:
- Adds activities not present in the narrative; merges others incorrectly (e.g., "Payment scheduling/Release" combines steps).
- "Compliance Officer Approval" is absent as a discrete activity, replaced with "Escalation for approval" (an unauthorized paraphrase).
- The labeling of columns ("Activities") and use of table format is acceptable in Markdown, but content errors persist.

**Strictness and Error Weighting**:
- Adding, merging, or renaming activities significantly deviates from instructions.
- Incorrect RACI marking (failing to use "R, A" where called for and not using dashes) is a major error.
- Some roles (e.g., Compliance Officer, Treasury Ops) are misrepresented in RACI assignments compared to ground truth.

**Summary**:
+1 for consistently using the four mandated terms where applicable.
-2 for introducing, merging, and renaming activities.
-2 for not marking "R, A" (double roles) and failing to use dashes for "no involvement."
-1 for inaccurate role assignment and RACI allocation.
-1 for omitting required activities and adding unauthorized ones.

Final: **5.0**—the answer is only half correct due to strict requirements. Major errors involve unauthorized activity names, RACI marking errors, and incomplete or merged process steps.
