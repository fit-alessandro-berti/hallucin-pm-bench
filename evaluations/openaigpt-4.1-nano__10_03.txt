### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. However, it fails the "do not rename, merge, or add activities" instruction by introducing three unauthorized additional activities ("Escalation for approval," "Payment scheduling/Release," "Notification of completion"), merging elements (e.g., scheduling and release), and omitting or misaligning others present in the narrative (e.g., no distinct "Compliance Officer Approval" or "Release Funds"). The ground truth includes exactly six activities, covering the narrative without excess.

RACI assignments show substantial deviations, even for the core four activities, violating strict accuracy:
- **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office Analyst is R (missing A); Compliance Officer is I (should be –).
- **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: Front-Office Analyst is I (should be –); Compliance Analyst is R (missing A).
- **Risk Scoring**: Front-Office Analyst is I (should be C); Compliance Analyst is R (correct, but Accountability shifts to Compliance Officer as A); Compliance Officer is C (should be A).

Additional activities are inaccurately named, merged, or invented compared to ground truth:
- "Escalation for approval" roughly aligns with "Compliance Officer Approval" but assigns only A to Compliance Officer (missing R); Treasury Ops is I (should be –).
- "Payment scheduling/Release" merges concepts but assigns Compliance Analyst as I (should be C for "Release Funds") and Treasury Ops as R (missing A).
- "Notification of completion" is entirely added and unsupported.

Formatting errors include: no bolding of activity names; uses I/C/R universally instead of – for no involvement; inconsistent table headers (e.g., "Activities" plural, role spacing mismatches); no "R, A" notation for dual roles. These small issues compound under strict criteria, indicating ~60% mismatch in content/structure. A higher score would require near-exact replication, including precise RACI, activity count/names, and formatting.
