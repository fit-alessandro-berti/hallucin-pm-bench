8.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, but there are some notable formatting and minor semantic differences that should impact the grade significantly, as per the strict grading criteria:

- The LLM answer omits the dash/bullet ("-") before each task and gateway difference, while the ground truth uses them. This is required in the ground truth's style (verbatim instruction compliance).
- The LLM answer gives the gateway type changes without aligning the gateway id as in the ground truth (which aligns Gateway_Payment with spaces), but this is minimal and arguably not enforced by the prompt.
- The LLM answer omits the indentation/spacing used in the ground truth.
- The LLM answer omits the explicit padding spaces in "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel", instead giving it as "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel".

There are no actual content errors—all correct ids and names are present, and nothing extra is present. But the strict instruction for "verbatim and in this order" for headings and output format does penalize small style deviations, which should result in a meaningful points deduction.

For these reasons, 8.5/10 is a fair score.
