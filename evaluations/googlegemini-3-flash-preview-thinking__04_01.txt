The LLM answer correctly determines "Non-compliant" and accurately identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event citations matching the ground truth logic. Descriptions of violations are substantively identical. Minor deductions for: (1) numerical discrepancy in Rule 3 distance (4 vs. ground truth's 3, a small counting/interpretation error); (2) lack of explicit checks for Rules 1, 4, and 5 (though correctly implicit as non-violated); (3) less comprehensive structure without full rule-by-rule audit or summary sentence. Format differences (bolding, violation-only numbering) are stylistic but diverge from ground truth. Overall very strong match under strict criteria, but not exact.
