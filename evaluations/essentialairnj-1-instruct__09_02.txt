The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in identifying the impossibility due to absent timestamps and providing a concise explanation focused on the lack of start/completion timing data. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "not possible to determine... log does not contain the timestamps necessary for... start and completion times" vs. "impossible to compute... no timestamps or duration information... only event counts... start-to-completion intervals absent"), which omit explicit reference to "event counts" and "duration information" despite implying them.
