3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Major Violations (Significant Point Deduction)**: The LLM answer includes extensive internal reasoning, step-by-step analysis, and commentary (e.g., "Okay, I'm going to compare...", "Let me take it one section at a time.", "I should ensure that I'm not including...") before the structured output. The prompt explicitly requires: "output must contain only the three required headings and the concrete differences" and "add no commentary." This extraneous content comprises ~80% of the response, directly contradicting instructions and rendering the output non-compliant. Alone, this warrants a score below 5.0 under strict evaluation.
  
- **Content Accuracy (Partial Credit)**: The identified changes (added tasks, removed task, gateway changes) are factually correct and complete, matching the ground truth in substance (IDs, names, types). No hallucinations or guesses. This earns some baseline points.

- **Formatting and Style Errors (Further Deductions)**: 
  - Headings are prefixed with dashes (e.g., "- ADDED TASKS"), unlike the ground truth's plain headings.
  - List items lack bullets (ground truth uses "- " for each), appearing as plain lines.
  - Gateway entries lack alignment (ground truth indents "Gateway_Payment" with spaces for visual consistency; LLM has none).
  - Uses asterisks for italics in the example style («old → new»), but ground truth uses plain text without markup—minor inconsistency, but strict rules penalize even small deviations.
  - Order is correct, but presentation deviates from the clean, verbatim structure expected.

Overall, while the core differences are verifiable and accurate, the response fails to adhere to the strict "only headings and differences" output format, leading to a low score. With utmost strictness, this is not a faithful match to the ground truth.
