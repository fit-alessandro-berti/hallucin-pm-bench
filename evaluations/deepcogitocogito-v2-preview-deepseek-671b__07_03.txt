7.5

The LLM answer identifies all the correct elements and changes, and notes the differences under the requested three headings. However, it contains several substantial deviations from the required format and instructions, warranting a significant deduction:

- It includes extensive commentary and process explanation before the answer, despite the instruction to provide only the headers and concrete differences, with no commentary.
- The output omits bullets/dashes for the gateway type changes and inconsistent spacing/leading dashes compared to the ground truth (though the content itself is correct).
- The tasks under the ADDED TASKS and REMOVED TASKS headings are listed without preceding dashes, unlike in the ground truth.
- The gateway changes in the LLM answer lack alignment/spacing, and are not formatted exactly as in the ground truth (missing indents or formatting).
- The instructions specified output should contain nothing but the three headings and the differences; this was clearly violated by the lengthy preamble and thinking-out-loud content.

Given these shortcomings, despite correct detection of all changes, a strict evaluation per instructions would reduce the score to 7.5.
