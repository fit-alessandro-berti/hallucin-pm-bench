10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in numerical accuracy for questions 1, 2a, and 2b, including calculations and rounding. For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (72 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue, highlights instability/variance (e.g., outlier effects, inflated variance, overfitting), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., misleading probabilities and conclusions), fulfilling all specified criteria without invention or deviation.
