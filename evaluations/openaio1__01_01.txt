### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major partial match, but significant deviations; ~40% of score weight)**: The LLM correctly identifies three decision points, aligning with the ground truth's count and covering the core elements (eligibility validation, pre-approval, and amount threshold/branching). However, under strict scrutiny:
  - LLM's #1 (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility) omits explicit branching outcomes (e.g., "Not eligible → claim rejected/returned"), reducing precision.
  - LLM's #2 (Finance_Controller_PreApprove) frames it as a standalone decision but does not tie it to final payment approval or rejection, missing the ground truth's integration in #3.
  - LLM's #3 (High-Value Branch) accurately captures the threshold but inaccurately implies low-value claims "proceed directly to payment" without conditioning on prior approval success or noting potential rejection, introducing a small but critical logical error per constraints. It also misplaces the branch timing slightly (ground truth specifies "after Finance_Controller_PreApprove").
  - Overall, the summaries lack the ground truth's tabular structure, explicit branching logic/outcomes, and combined "final payment approval" framing, leading to substantive differences in completeness and accuracy. No extraneous activities introduced, which is positive.
  
- **Required Documents (near-perfect match; ~60% of score weight)**: The list is identical in content, order, and count (7 items). Minor deductions for:
  - Not specifying the conditional nature of AuditTrail ("only for claims > €1 000, but still part of the catalogue") as precisely as ground truth.
  - Omitting the ground truth's closing note on no other documents/legacy activities, though this is not strictly required by the prompt.

The response is concise and adheres to the prompt's "do not introduce" rule, but the decision point discrepancies (especially incomplete branching and logical assumptions) warrant a lower score under utmost strictness. Small errors like phrasing and omissions compound to prevent a higher grade.
