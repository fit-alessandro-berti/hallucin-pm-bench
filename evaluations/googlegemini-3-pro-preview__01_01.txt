### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiency, ~60% of Score Impact):** The LLM answer identifies only 1 explicit decision point (the high-value threshold > €1,000), which aligns partially with ground truth point #2. However, it completely omits two critical implied decision points from the process description: (1) the eligibility validation in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** (which inherently involves a pass/fail on eligibility, leading to continuation or rejection), and (2) the approval/rejection outcome in **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** (and conditionally **Senior_Auditor_Review**), which gates payment. The ground truth explicitly includes these as standard inferences from the process steps and constraints. This omission of "every decision point" (as required by the prompt) represents a substantial incompleteness, warranting severe deduction under strict criteria—small interpretive errors in process inference are not excused, as the ground truth demonstrates they must be surfaced.
  
- **Required Documents (Full Match, ~40% of Score Impact):** The LLM lists all 7 documents accurately, matching the ground truth catalog exactly (including the conditional note on **AuditTrail** for high-value claims). No extras or omissions, and it adheres to the prompt by not introducing undefined artifacts. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., no final disclaimer note) are negligible but do not add points.

Overall, the answer is incomplete and fails to comprehensively summarize *every* decision point, leading to a low score despite strong handling of documents. Strict evaluation penalizes the core analytical shortfall heavily.
