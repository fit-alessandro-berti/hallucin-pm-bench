The LLM answer accurately identifies the correct response ("No") and provides a precise, one-paragraph justification that directly cites the key counter-examples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11, with implicit note on absence of Receive_Order), mirroring the ground truth's core points without factual errors. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., referencing line 12 in C005 unnecessarily, though it doesn't alter accuracy) and not using bullet formatting, but these are negligible under strict evaluation.
