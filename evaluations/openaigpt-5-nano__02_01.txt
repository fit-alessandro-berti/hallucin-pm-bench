8.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth on Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, showing correct reading and extraction of those facts from the event log fragment. 

However, for Q5 ("List every activity that never appears as the first event of any case"), the ground truth lists three activities: "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order", but the LLM answer omits "Validate_Order". This is a clear factual omission, since "Validate_Order" never appears as the first event of any case.

Given that the schema, JSON syntax, and all other answers are correct, but one activity is missing in Q5, a strict grading rubric would reduce the score significantly but not to failure. A deduction of 2 points (20%) is fair for one out of three correct items missing in Q5.

Final score: 8.0
