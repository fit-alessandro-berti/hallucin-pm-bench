7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, not part of the scored output):
- **Q1-Q4**: Perfect match (no deductions).
- **Q5**: Incomplete list; misses "Validate_Order" (a clear activity that never starts a case, based on the log's first events: Receive_Order for A-9321/B-1045, Quality_Check for C-77). This is a significant factual omission under strict evaluation, as the question requires listing *every* such activity. The provided items are correct but insufficient, warranting a major deduction.
- **Overall**: 80% alignment (4/5 questions exact; Q5 ~67% partial credit), adjusted down for strictness on incompleteness in a precise JSON schema requirement.
