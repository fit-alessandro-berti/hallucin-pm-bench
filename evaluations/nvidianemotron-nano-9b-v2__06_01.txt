The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel, with proper alphabetical ordering both within pairs (C before Q; P before S) and overall list (C-pair before P-pair). It ignores Process A as required and uses one pair per line. However, under utmost strictness, it loses minor points for slight formatting deviations from the specified "Task_X  â€”  Task_Y" (e.g., inconsistent spacing around the em dash compared to the two spaces shown, and lack of alignment padding in the second pair to match the ground truth's presentation), which qualifies as a small error warranting a deduction.
