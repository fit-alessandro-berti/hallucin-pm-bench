6.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two pairs of parallel tasks as described in the process: 

- Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
- Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

However, there are notable issues:

1. **Formatting Issues**: The answer does not follow the required output format. The prompt specifies use of exactly two spaces on either side of an em dash, e.g. `Task_X  —  Task_Y` (note: double spaces before and after the em dash), and output one pair per line. The LLM answer uses a single dash (—), single spaces, and omits the code block format from the ground truth.
   
2. **Alphabetical Alignment**: While the pairs themselves have tasks in alphabetical order within each pair, and the overall list is in correct order, the formatting fault reduces the score.
   
3. **Literal Fidelity**: The output omits the required formatting precision, which is crucial per the instructions given the strictness requested.

Despite the content being correct, the lack of strict attention to format results in a significant penalty, hence 6.5 rather than a higher score.
