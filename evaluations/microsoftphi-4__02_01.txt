The LLM answer's JSON output matches the ground truth exactly in content, structure, and values across all questions (Q1-Q5), with no factual errors or deviations. Although the response includes extraneous explanatory text prior to the JSON (which mildly violates the "exactly this JSON schema" instruction), the required output is correctly provided and dominant, warranting no deduction under strict evaluation focused on answer accuracy and fidelity to the ground truth.
