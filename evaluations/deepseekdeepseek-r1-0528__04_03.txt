The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and aligns precisely with the ground truth in conclusion ("No"), rule-by-rule assessment (all four rules correctly evaluated with identical reasoning and no violations of facts), and overall justification structure. Minor differences in phrasing, detail level (e.g., explicit positions), and format (bullets vs. table) do not introduce errors or deviate from the prompt's requirements for a short justification referencing each rule; they enhance clarity without inaccuracy.
