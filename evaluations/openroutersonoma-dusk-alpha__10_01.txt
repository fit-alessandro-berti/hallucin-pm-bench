7.0

**Justification**:

**Vocabulary policy adherence (critical):**
- The required synonyms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") are used and the forbidden terms do not appear. ✅
- Correct spellings and capitalization in LLM answer. ✅

**Structure and format:**
- The matrix is formatted clearly, with correct activities as rows and roles as columns. ✅

**RACI assignments:**
- The ground truth shows **greater nuance and accuracy in role assignments**:
  - Many rows in the LLM have *R/A* duplicated (e.g., "Notify Customer", "Receive Application", "Order Vetting"), where the ground truth is more careful (typically splitting R and A, or adding secondary roles as Consulted or Informed).
  - LLM assigns "KYC Review": AM as C, CO as R/A, which is close to the ground truth (AM A, CO R, FC C, IT I), but missing two assignments.
  - "Order Vetting": LLM says AM R/A, CO C, missing FC and IT, where ground truth lists AM R/A, CO C, FC I, IT I.
  - "Payment Clearance": LLM puts FC as R/A, but ground truth splits (AM A, CO C, FC R, IT I).
  - "Record Update": LLM has AM A, FC C, IT R; leaves out CO (ground truth: AM C, CO I, FC C, IT R).
  - "Notify Customer": LLM has AM R/A, IT I; ground truth: AM R/A, CO I, FC I, IT I.
- The **LLM answer consistently omits some "I" and "C" roles**, which are present in the ground truth. This is a significant issue for accuracy.

**Other points:**
- The LLM includes extra content (preamble, notes, RACI definitions). The ground truth omits this, but it does not add errors.
- The LLM's own notes paraphrase the vocabulary policy ("e.g., KYC Review for customer verification..."), which lightly but not egregiously steps over "do not mention the forbidden terms," but does NOT actually list them.

**Summary:**  
- Good adherence to vocabulary and general process, but significant and repeated omissions of consulted/informed roles and misuse of R/A instead of assigning roles distinctly as in the ground truth. Each of the six rows is missing at least one correct C or I assignment.
- These are not minor errors—role mapping is the main goal.

**Deduction rationale:**
- Start at 10 for correct use of required terms and format.
- Minus 3 points for numerous and repeated missing or incorrect RACI assignments (the deliverable's main point).
- Minus further 0.5 for allowing minor extra "roles" (that is, extra R/A or omissions).
- Minus 0.5 for including process mapping notes when not requested (per 'also small errors...' in the rubric).

**Final: 7.0**
