The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") without forbidden variants, adheres to the core process steps as rows, and includes no extra tasks, roles, or columns. However, it introduces unwarranted content (RACI definitions and explanatory notes, absent in the ground truth) and fails to match the ground truth's RACI assignments across most cells (e.g., 18+ out of 24 cells differ, including key mismatches like Compliance Officer as "I" vs. "C" in Receive Application, "R/A" vs. "R" in KYC Review, and multiple "- " vs. "I" or "C" placements). Role headers include unnecessary abbreviations. Bolding for emphasis (e.g., on **R** cells and activity names in ground truth) is missing. These errors, even if partially derived from the narrative, result in substantial deviation under strict evaluation criteria, warranting significant point loss despite the correct structure and vocabulary compliance.
