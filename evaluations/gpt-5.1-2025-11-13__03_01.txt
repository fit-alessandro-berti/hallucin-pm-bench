3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer captures the overall process flow and loop correctly but introduces significant structural inaccuracies, incomplete BPMN elements, and deviations from the prompt's "exactly as stated" requirement. Under utmost strictness, these warrant major deductions:

- **Critical structural error (-4.0 points)**: The password reset path routes "Provide Reset Instructions" (tProvideReset) directly to "Resolve Issue" (tResolve) via f5, then to confirm. The prompt (line 3) states it "goes straight to 'Provide Reset Instructions'" without mentioning any subsequent "Resolve Issue" step for this path. This invents an unmentioned activity connection, violating "Do not invent or add ... activities ... that are not mentioned." The ground truth correctly skips "Resolve Issue" for this path (t2 → t6 directly), treating "Provide Reset Instructions" as implicit resolution before confirmation (line 7).

- **Incomplete exclusive gateways (-1.5 points)**: No `<conditionExpression>` on outgoing sequence flows from gateways (e.g., gw1, gw2, gw3), unlike the ground truth's explicit "yes"/"no" conditions (e.g., f3/f4 for gw1). BPMN 2.0 exclusive gateways require conditions for decisions; omitting them makes the XML semantically incomplete and non-executable as a full model.

- **Non-concise IDs (-1.0 point)**: Uses descriptive IDs (e.g., tClassify, tProvideReset, gwResolveOrForward implied in naming) instead of the prompt-specified concise format (e.g., t1, gw1). Ground truth adheres strictly (t1–t6, gw1–gw3).

- **Inaccurate element names (-0.5 points total)**:
  - Classification task: "Classify Ticket" vs. ground truth "Auto-Classification" (prompt line 2 emphasizes "automatically classified by the system"; LLM omits "auto-").
  - gw2: "Resolve or Forward?" is close to prompt line 5 but less precise than ground truth's "Resolved Internally?" (capturing the agent's post-diagnosis decision).
  - gw3: "Issue Resolved?" vs. ground truth "Customer Confirms?" (prompt line 8 focuses on customer confirmation, not general issue resolution; LLM's name misaligns).

- **Minor XML/BPMN deviations (-0.0 points cumulative, but noted for strictness)**: Missing XML declaration; `isExecutable="true"` vs. ground truth "false" (prompt doesn't specify, but ground truth sets non-executable for modeling); added unnecessary `id="defs1"` on `<definitions>`; different `targetNamespace`. These are small but reflect non-exact translation. Line count is under 40 (good), and no invented elements like timers/escalations (good), but errors compound.

The answer has three gateways (including the unmentioned-but-implied confirmation decision; prompt specifies only "two" but ground truth uses three, so no deduction here). The rework loop (gw3 → Initial Diagnosis on non-confirmation) matches line 9 exactly in both. Overall fidelity to ground truth is ~40% (core flow present but distorted), justifying a low score. No hallucinations beyond the routing, but strictness demands near-perfect match.
