9.0

- The LLM answer is factually correct and accurately addresses all three questions based on the event log fragment.
- Minor deductions for slight deviations in conciseness and format: the responses for Q2 and Q3 are more verbose than the ground truth's brief style (e.g., full sentences vs. single terms), and bullet-point labeling differs (**1.** vs. **A1:**), violating the "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction to a small degree. No content errors, but strict evaluation penalizes non-exact matching.
