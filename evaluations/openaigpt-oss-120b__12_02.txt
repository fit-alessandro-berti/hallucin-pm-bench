The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and accuracy: it correctly answers "No" first, followed by a one-paragraph justification citing the exact same counterexamples (C003 with reversed order on lines 6-7, and C005 with Validate_Payment on line 11 lacking any Receive_Order). Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "violating the claimed ordering" vs. "clear counter-examples"; "no preceding... at all" vs. "never contains... at all") are stylistic and do not introduce errors, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements and the log data.
