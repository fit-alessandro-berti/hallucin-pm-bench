The LLM answer correctly identifies that the claim is false, referencing case C003 (lines 6–7) as a direct violation. However, it introduces an error by discussing "immediate sequence" in C002 (lines 3–5), implying that *Validate_Payment* must directly follow *Receive_Order*. The claim in question is about *Validate_Payment* ever occurring after *Receive_Order* (not necessarily immediately after), so the C002 example does not contradict the claim. More importantly, the LLM fails to mention the stronger counter-example in C005, where *Validate_Payment* exists (line 11) without any occurrence of *Receive_Order*, which is essential to fully justify the "No" answer. Omitting this critical case, and the confusion regarding C002, are significant enough to reduce the score.
