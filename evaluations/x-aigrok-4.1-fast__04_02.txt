**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correct (3/6 rules + overall)**: R1, R3, R6 statuses and justifications align closely with ground truth. Overall **NON-COMPLIANT** is correct (detected R3 violation).
- **Major errors (significant point loss per strictness)**:
  - **R2**: Wrong status (**Compliant** vs. **Violated**). Justification ignores post-Change_Request new approval (07-Mar) as "last required approval"; Ship_Goods (05-Mar) >2 days prior.
  - **R4**: Wrong status (**Compliant** vs. **Not Applicable**). Rule conditional on `hazardous=true`; false triggers N/A, not compliance assertion.
  - **R5**: Wrong status (**Compliant** vs. **Violated**). Justification factually incorrect: new Manager_Approval (#8, 07-Mar) *after* Ship_Goods (#5, 05-Mar) and Pay_Invoice (#7, 06-Mar), violating "before any further processing."
- 50% rule accuracy; flawed reasoning on Change_Request impacts (R2/R5 linkage); R4 semantic error. Justifications ≤20 words but inaccurate. Half-credit baseline, deducted for multiple critical mismatches.
