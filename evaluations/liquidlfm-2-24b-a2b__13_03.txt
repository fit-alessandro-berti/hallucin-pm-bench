7.5

**Part 1**: Perfect match (exact count of 1, with correct activity string emphasis). Full points.

**Part 2**: Concise (72 words, compliant). Correctly notes tiny sample (3 cases) and risks of over/underestimation from limited data. However, misses key ground-truth elements: quantitative impact (e.g., 0%-7% swing, wide confidence interval, sampling error for rares); precise scope (14 events, <2 hours); and critical confusion from near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) causing strict/fuzzy matching distortions. These omissions reduce depth and specificity, warranting deduction despite solid basics.
