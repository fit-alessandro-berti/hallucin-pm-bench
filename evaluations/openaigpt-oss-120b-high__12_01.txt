The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely aligns with the ground truth in verdict, structure, and evidence-based justification across all cases. It correctly identifies the reversed order in cases 1001 and 1003, the absence in case 1002, and emphasizes the "immediately" aspect (which the ground truth implies but does not explicitly highlight for all cases). Minor deductions for not including specific line references (present in ground truth) and slightly more emphatic phrasing ("not supported" vs. direct "inaccurate"), but these are negligible and do not introduce errorsâ€”the analysis remains strictly data-driven and concise without deviations from the prompt's requirements.
