9.5

- The LLM answer correctly identifies all three cases (Q1), matches the ground truth for the predecessor of "Ship_Order" in C456 (Q2), and identifies that "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once (Q3).  
- However, a strict evaluation penalizes verbosity in Q1 and Q3:  
  - Q1: The answer lists case names instead of only stating the number, when the question asked for "how many" (should have answered simply "3" or "3 cases").  
  - Q3: It provides justification ("while the other activities ... occur multiple times") instead of only the concise answer ("Cancel_Order").
- These minor format and brevity issues, while not content errors, do not follow the instruction for "concise, bullet-point answers only." This leads to a minor loss of points.
- No factual errors; thus, 0.5 points deducted for lack of strict conciseness.
