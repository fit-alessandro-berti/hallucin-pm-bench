9.5

- **Q1 Evaluation**: Nearly identical to ground truth (3 cases listed correctly, minor differences in wording/order and phrasing like "distinct...are present" vs. simple enumeration); fully accurate but slightly less concise—minimal deduction.
- **Q2 Evaluation**: Core answer "Pack_Items" matches exactly and is correct (verified by timestamps for C456: Create_Order at 09:10, Validate_Order at 09:20, Pack_Items at 09:35 precedes Ship_Order at 09:40); however, adds unnecessary explanatory details and timestamps, violating "concise" instruction—moderate deduction for verbosity.
- **Q3 Evaluation**: Core answer "Cancel_Order" matches exactly and is correct (appears only once; others multiple times as stated); verification confirms no errors in explanation, but again, adds extraneous details (case reference, activity list, and rationale), breaching conciseness—moderate deduction for verbosity.
- **Overall**: Excellent accuracy and completeness, but strict penalties for non-concise format (numbered list vs. bullets, extra text) and deviation from "answers only." Total reflects high fidelity with targeted losses for style violations.
