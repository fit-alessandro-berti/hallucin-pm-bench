The LLM answer correctly identifies the added tasks (check_vip, generate_qr), removed task (send_rma_label), and gateway change (gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the factual differences in the XML. However, it fails to use the element names (i.e., the 'name' attribute values like "Check Customer VIP Status") exactly as they appear, instead listing only IDs, which directly violates the instruction and introduces significant inaccuracy. Headings use incorrect formatting (### instead of â€¢), the gateway change omits version specifics present in the ground truth for clarity, and bullet styles differ ( - vs. * ), resulting in incomplete and non-compliant presentation. No mention of "(none)" is needed since all categories have items, but the overall strict non-adherence to exact naming and structure warrants a mid-low score.
