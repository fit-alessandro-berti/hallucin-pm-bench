The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It:

- Correctly identifies two sets of concurrent tasks and numbers them in order.
- Lists the same tasks in each parallel set as in the ground truth, with correct naming.
- Restricts focus to Process B and gives no information about A or C, as instructed.

Minor differences that justify a deduction:

- It does not explicitly state "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." The prompt does not absolutely require this, but the ground truth includes it for completeness.
- It uses "|| Parallel Split #1 ||" and "|| Parallel Split #2 ||" phrasing instead of "first parallel block"/"second parallel block", though this is a slight stylistic/labeling difference and does not affect substance.

For these small omissions/differences, particularly the lack of explicit closure regarding no other concurrent sets, a point is deducted.
