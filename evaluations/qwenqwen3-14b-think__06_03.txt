The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two required sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, in the correct order, with accurate task names and no extraneous information about other processes. It adheres closely to the prompt's focus. Minor deductions for formatting differences (e.g., bullet points vs. inline `task` â€– `task` notation; "Parallel Split #1" labeling vs. "first parallel block"; absence of the explicit "No other tasks" closure, though not strictly required by the prompt) and lack of code-style markup, per the ground truth's presentation.
