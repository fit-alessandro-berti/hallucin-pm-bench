**9.2**

The LLM answer is factually correct (Yes, same minimal sequence T1→T2→T7→T4→T5, accurate explanation of markings/P2 persistence/T3 delay). It correctly demonstrates T5 before T3, stays under 120 words, and confirms minimality.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- No explicit markings (e.g., M₁={P1,P2}), unlike ground truth's detailed verification.
- Combined explanation under Answer 2 (vs. separate Q1 brief + Q2 details).
- List format [ ] vs. numbered steps.

Substance matches perfectly; stylistic/presentation differences only.
