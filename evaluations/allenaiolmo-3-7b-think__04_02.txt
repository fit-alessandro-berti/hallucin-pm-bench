6.0

**Evaluation reasoning (strict criteria applied):**
- **Statuses**: 5/6 correct (R1, R3, R4, R5, R6 match). R2 wrong (Compliant vs. Violated) – major error (-2.0 points).
- **Justifications**: R2 completely mismatched/misunderstands "last required approval" post-Change_Request (-1.0). Others similar but phrasing/dates/steps differ slightly (e.g., R3 uses steps vs. dates; R5 omits Pay_Invoice) – minor errors (-0.5 total).
- **Format**: Rules listed correctly with ≤20-word justis, overall correct, but stray "COMPLIANT" at top disrupts/misleads (-0.5).
- **Overall**: Matches NON-COMPLIANT, no extra violations listed (not required).
- Base 10.0 → deductions = 6.0.
