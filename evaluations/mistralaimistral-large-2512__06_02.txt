The LLM answer correctly identifies all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names and comma-separated formatting matching the ground truth lists (including spaces after commas). However, under utmost strictness, it deducts 1.0 point for the unnecessary introductory sentence and bold markdown "**Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing**", which deviates from the precise instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" (implying no additional prose or formatting), creating a structural difference from the minimal ground truth output. No other errors in content, sequencing, or exclusion of sequential tasks.
