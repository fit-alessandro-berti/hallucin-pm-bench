9.0

### Evaluation Summary
The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible (yes), provides an accurate and concrete firing sequence (T1, T2, T5, T3, ... ) identical in effect to the ground truth, and includes a valid brief justification tied to the inhibitor arc and enabling conditions. It structures the response clearly with steps, markings, and explanations, enhancing readability without introducing errors. However, under strict evaluation criteria, it loses 1.0 point for a slightly shallower justification: it does not emphasize the permanence of T5's disablement after T3 (i.e., T5 "must" precede T3 if it fires, as p4's token blocks it irreversibly without T4, which requires p3). This omits a key analytical insight from the ground truth, representing a minor but notable difference in depth. No factual inaccuracies or extraneous content detract further.
