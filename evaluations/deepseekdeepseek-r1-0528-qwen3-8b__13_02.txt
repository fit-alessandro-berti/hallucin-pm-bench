10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly, including calculations and rounding. For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (79 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue ("single data point"), notes variance/instability ("unreliable indicators... skew... high bias"), and cautions against over-generalization ("oversimplifies process behavior, resulting in flawed decision-making"), aligning with the required criteria despite varied wording. No errors or deviations.
