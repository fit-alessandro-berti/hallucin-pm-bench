6.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Documents list (35% weight)**: Identical to ground truth (7 items, same descriptions, AuditTrail caveat matches). Full marks here.
- **Decision points (65% weight)**: Substantial differences, warranting heavy deduction:
  | Aspect | Issue | Point Loss |
  |--------|--------|------------|
  | Count & Structure | 4 points vs. ground truth's 3; no table format (minor, but strictness applies); lacks explicit "branching logic / outcomes" columns. | -1.5 |
  | Content Accuracy #1 | Matches ground truth #1 (eligibility in triage) but omits explicit outcomes (*Eligible* → continue; *Not eligible* → rejected). Vague "decide whether eligible". | -0.8 |
  | Content Accuracy #2 | Adds standalone pre-approve decision (implied approve/reject), but ground truth merges into #3 as "final payment approval". Not wrong per process, but deviates from ground truth framing. | -0.7 |
  | Content Accuracy #3 | Matches ground truth #2 (amount threshold post-preapprove), good "implicit decision" note. | 0 |
  | Content Accuracy #4 | **Major violation**: Introduces undefined activity "Senior_Auditor_Review_Completion" (prompt forbids introducing non-defined activities). Restates constraint, not a true decision point; ground truth avoids by merging into #3. No equivalent in ground truth. | -2.0 |
  | Branching/Outcomes | Incomplete/missing explicit rejects/ends (e.g., no "claim rejected/returned" or process-end logic); ground truth is precise. | -1.0 |
  | Placement/Flow | Threshold (#3) correctly post-preapprove implicitly, but overall splits approvals differently from ground truth's combined #3. | -0.5 |

- **Overall**: Documents save it from lower, but decision points have critical intro of invalid element + mismatches = 62% alignment. Strict penalty for small omissions (outcomes) and big ones (new activity). No other violations (e.g., no legacy intro).
