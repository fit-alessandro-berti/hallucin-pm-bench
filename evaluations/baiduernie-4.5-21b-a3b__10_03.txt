The LLM answer fails critically on multiple fronts under strict evaluation criteria. It directly violates the vocabulary policy by using the forbidden term "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)" (a disallowed synonym for "KYC Review"), introduces variations like "Derive Risk Scoring" instead of exact "Risk Scoring," and employs descriptive phrasings (e.g., "Perform Intake Vetting") that deviate from the ground truth's precise, unadorned activity names. It adds unauthorized activities ("Grant Approval for High-Risk Payments," "Schedule Payment for Low-Risk Payments," "Notify Originating Analyst") and merges/splits others inconsistently, ignoring the "do not rename, merge, or add activities" rule. RACI assignments are inaccurate or absent (e.g., "Risk Scoring" row is entirely empty; no "C" roles anywhere despite ground truth's heavy use; incorrect mappings like Intake Vetting lacking "A" for Front-Office Analyst and all "C" and "I" involvements). Formatting errors include using "-" instead of "â€“," no bolding, and an extraneous explanation section not present in the ground truth. The output covers fewer than all required activities and roles accurately, with zero fidelity to the mandated structure.
