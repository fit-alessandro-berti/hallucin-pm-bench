The LLM answer correctly identifies the "Collect Equipment" task for modification and provides a relevant rationale tied to SLA compliance, but it loses significant points for using an incorrect due date value ("P3D" instead of the ground truth "P2D"), an incomplete unified diff format lacking the required "@@" hunk headers and context lines, and a rationale that fails to specify the critical "3-day SLA" detail, introducing vagueness where precision is demanded.
