The LLM answer closely follows the instructions: it provides a single diff, changes only the allowed attribute (`camunda:dueDate`), and does not add or delete any activity.

However, there is a critical error in the numerical value: the due date is set to "P3D" (3 days) instead of the required "P2D" (2 days). This discrepancy is significant, as the goal is to ensure the process fits within the 3-day SLA, and the offered solution may not guarantee this, per the ground truth rationale.

The rationale sentence is reasonably clear, but less precise than the ground truth; it incorrectly claims alignment with the onboarding timeline (which is at risk), and lacks the explicit reference to the 3-day SLA and the calculation for total onboarding time.

Because of the single-attribute-value error and the less precise rationale, there is a significant point deduction, but the structure, location, scope, and compliance with all output rules are otherwise correct.
