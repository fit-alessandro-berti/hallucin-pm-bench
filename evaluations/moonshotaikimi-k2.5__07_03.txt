The LLM answer is semantically perfect, capturing all verifiable changes exactly as per the prompt's instructions and XML diffs: correct added tasks (3), removed task (1), and gateway changes (2, with precise old→new types matching v1 exclusive to v2 parallel). No extras, no omissions, no commentary.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for formatting deviations from ground truth under utmost strictness:
- Missing leading "-" bullets on all 6 items (-0.8).
- Missing alignment spaces after "Gateway_Payment:" (-0.2).

These are small presentational issues, not functional errors, but warrant significant point loss per criteria. No other discrepancies.
