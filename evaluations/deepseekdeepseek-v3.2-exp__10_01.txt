4.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology Compliance (max 3.0)**: 3.0. The LLM answer correctly uses exactly "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" without any forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). Capitalization and spelling match the policy. No mentions of forbidden terms in any form.
  
- **RACI Correctness (max 5.0)**: 1.0. The Responsible (R) assignments are accurate and match the process narrative (one R per activity, aligned with roles: AM for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Notify Customer; CO for KYC Review; FC for Payment Clearance; IT for Record Update). However, the matrix is severely incompleteâ€”it omits all Accountable (A), Consulted (C), and Informed (I) assignments, leaving most cells blank. The ground truth provides a full RACI with specific distributions (e.g., AM as R/A in multiple steps, CO as C in several, widespread I assignments), reflecting appropriate oversight and collaboration implied by the workflow. This partial implementation fails to produce a complete RACI matrix, introducing major differences from the ground truth.

- **Structure and Formatting (max 1.5)**: 0.5. Activities are listed correctly as rows with proper sequencing and renaming, and roles as columns without extras. No unwarranted content like additional tasks or roles. However, significant deviations include: numbering activities (absent in ground truth), using abbreviations in headers (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)" vs. full names), no bolding of mandated terms or R/A notations, and blanks imply no assignments where ground truth specifies C/I. The introductory text ("Of course...") and explanatory note ("R = Responsible") add minor extraneous content not in the ground truth.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt and Ground Truth (max 0.5)**: 0.0. The response adheres to the process description but ignores the fuller RACI expectations evident in the ground truth (e.g., AM accountability, consultative roles). Strict evaluation penalizes the incomplete matrix heavily, as it does not "reflect the narrative" beyond basic Rs, leading to substantial differences.

This score reflects utmost strictness: the correct terminology and Rs earn credit, but the incomplete RACI (core output) results in a low overall grade, with small formatting issues compounding the deduction.
