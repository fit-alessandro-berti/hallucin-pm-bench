**7.0**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Line-by-Line & Semantic Comparison)
The LLM answer correctly captures the process topology, all 7 required activities (names nearly exact, with minor "Classify Ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification" variance), the exact re-work loop to "Initial Diagnosis" (gw3 → t3), 3 exclusive gateways (prompt says "two" but description implies 3; both answers use 3), no invented elements (e.g., no timers, extra tasks, parallels), concise IDs, and ≤40 lines (~35). Structure matches ground truth 100%: start/classify/gw1(password branch to reset→confirm; else diagnosis→gw2(resolve/forward→resolve→confirm); gw3(confirm/close or loop)).

**Major Deductions (-2.0 total):**
- **gw2 invalid exclusive gateway (-1.5)**: No `<conditionExpression>` on f7/f8 (e.g., no "yes"/"no" for "Resolve Issue" vs. "Forward to Specialist"). BPMN exclusive gw requires conditions/defaultFlow for decision; this renders it non-executable/ambiguous, mismatching description's "either...or" and ground truth's yes/no. Critical functional error.
- **Invented activity types (-0.5)**: Uses `<serviceTask>` (t1,t2) and `<userTask>` (t3-t6) vs. ground truth's generic `<task>`. Violates "Do not invent...activities"; adds unmentioned implementation details.

**Minor Deductions (-1.0 total):**
- **Condition mismatches (-0.5)**: gw1 "Password Reset" (textually accurate but vs. "yes"); gw3 "Confirmed"/"Issue Persists" (accurate vs. "yes"/"no"); gw1 f4 lacks "no" (uses default, but ground explicit).
- **Missing XML/attrs (-0.3)**: No `<?xml>`, `targetNamespace`, process `name`/ `isExecutable`; no names on start ("Ticket Submitted"), end ("Ticket Closed"), gateways ("Password Reset?", etc.). Ground has descriptive metadata; prompt allows concise but differences accumulate.
- **t1 name variance (-0.2)**: "Classify Ticket" vs. "Auto-Classification" (both inferred, but not exact desc phrasing).

Semantically strong (no hallucinations, exact loop/flows), but XML/semantics have enough diffs/errors for strict 7.0 (70% fidelity; perfect=10.0, minor-only~9.0, this has critical gw2 flaw).
