The LLM answer incorrectly concludes "Yes" (overall compliance), missing the clear violation of Rule 3 where NA precedes RA in the trace (occurs after QE but before RA, despite requiring both). This is a critical error inverting the sequence, leading to an invalid assessment. Rules 1, 2, and 4 are correctly identified as satisfied, but the failure on Rule 3 and the overall verdict warrant a severe deduction under strict evaluation criteria. No table format or precise reasoning structure matches the ground truth, further reducing fidelity.
