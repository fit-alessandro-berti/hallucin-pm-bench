R1: Correct (Compliant), reasoning agrees.
R2: Incorrect reasoning. The LLM incorrectly uses Finance_Approval as the final approval for the Ship_Goods timing, but after a Change_Request, and per R5, a new Manager_Approval is needed before further processing. Thus, Ship_Goods occurs before this new approval (Ship_Goods 05-Mar, Manager_Approval 07-Mar), so the 2-day window starts from 07-Mar, not 04-Mar. LLM missed this and used the wrong approval as reference.
R3: Correct (Violated), accurate justification.
R4: Correct (Not Applicable), accurate justification.
R5: Incorrect. The LLM claims compliance, but actually, processing (Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice) resumes before new Manager_Approval. LLM misses the R5 violation.
R6: Correct (Compliant), accurate justification.

Overall verdict is correct (**NON-COMPLIANT**), but major errors in both R2 and R5 rule assessments and their justifications, plus not fully incorporating the interaction of rule dependencies (especially R2 and R5), are significant. These are serious errors. The errors in R2 and R5 account for at least a 4â€“5 point deduction due to misapplication of the rules, especially around the post-Change_Request scenario.

Final score: 5.0
