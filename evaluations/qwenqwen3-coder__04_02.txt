5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Fully matches status and justification intent (correct identification of approvals for high amount). No deduction.
- **R2**: Status matches (Violated), but justification is incorrect and incomplete—fails to account for the Change_Request triggering a new approval on 2025-03-07 as the "last required approval," making Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) non-compliant due to occurring before (not within 2 days after) it. Significant deduction for flawed reasoning, as this misapplies the rule's timing post-change.
- **R3**: Status matches. Justification is acceptable but imprecise (relies on step numbering rather than explicit dates); however, it correctly identifies the precedence violation. Minor deduction for not citing dates, per strictness.
- **R4**: Fully matches status and justification. No deduction.
- **R5**: Major mismatch—status incorrectly Compliant instead of Violated. Justification wrongly claims new Manager_Approval precedes further steps, ignoring that Ship_Goods (step 5), Receive_Goods (step 6), and Pay_Invoice (step 7) are "further processing steps" occurring after Change_Request (step 4) but before the new approval (step 8). Severe deduction for reversing the rule violation.
- **R6**: Fully matches status and justification. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Matches NON-COMPLIANT, but underlying errors in R2 and especially R5 undermine the conclusion's accuracy. No deduction here, but contributes to total.

**Total Score Rationale**: Strict evaluation penalizes the critical error in R5 (wrong status, inverting compliance) and R2's substantive reasoning flaw heavily (each ~2-point loss), plus minor R3 issue (~0.5-point loss). Base of 10 reduced to 5.0, reflecting ~50% accuracy in rule assessments despite format adherence.
