The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) as in the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3. The explanation accurately describes the enabling conditions for T5 while P2 remains marked. However, it omits the step-by-step markings (e.g., M₁ to M₅) and the key detail that T5 consumes P2, disabling T3 afterward, which the ground truth uses for confirmation. This reduces completeness, warranting a strict deduction despite staying under the word limit and avoiding factual errors.
