**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (supporting high score)**: 
  - Correctly identifies all key decision points (triage eligibility, finance pre-approval, high-value threshold branch, senior review), closely aligning with ground truth's 3 points (triage #1, threshold #2, combined finance/senior approval #3).
  - Complete document list **exactly matches** ground truth (all 7 artefacts, with AuditTrail correctly noted as high-value).
  - No introduction of undefined activities (e.g., no legacy "CustomerService_Agent_Decide").
  - Covers process flow accurately without extraneous content.

- **Errors/Differences (deducting 2.0 points total, per strict criteria)**:
  - **Structure/format mismatch (-0.5)**: Bulleted prose vs. ground truth's precise table (#s, columns for "Decision point" and "Branching logic/outcomes") + numbered doc list. Minor but penalized.
  - **Decision point count/phrasing (-0.8)**: Lists 4 points (separates "High-value branch check" and "Senior_Auditor_Review") vs. ground truth's consolidated 3. Phrasing interpretive (e.g., "align with... justified by WeatherReport" vs. exact "Eligibility check"; "review and clear" assumes success). Small but significant loss.
  - **Incomplete branching logic (-0.5)**: Mentions yes/no for high-value but omits explicit rejection outcomes (e.g., no "Not eligible → rejected"; no "Rejected → process ends" for approvals/triage), unlike ground truth's detailed outcomes.
  - **Minor artefact intro (-0.2)**: "Claim details with the refund amount" not defined in process (violation of "Do not introduce... artefacts"), despite correct overall list.

Overall: Highly accurate and comprehensive (80%+ match), but strict deductions for format, exactness, and small violations prevent 9+.
