The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Roles mismatch**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely, which is present in the ground truth as a key accountable party across all tasks. It only includes three roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support) instead of four, altering the RACI structure fundamentally.
- **Tasks mismatch**: Task descriptions do not align closely. The LLM introduces an extra task ("Send SWIFT Message") absent in the ground truth, while combining or rephrasing others (e.g., "Log Transfer Instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record"). This results in 7 rows instead of 6, with incomplete coverage of source steps without matching ground truth phrasing.
- **RACI assignments differ extensively**: Nearly every cell mismatches. The LLM relies heavily on "R/A" in single cells for primary roles and leaves most blank (implying no involvement), with limited use of "C" (none at all) and sporadic "I". The ground truth distributes responsibilities more granularly (e.g., Regulatory Liaison is "R" for KYC Review and Approve, but "A" only via Operations Manager; Transaction Analyst is "C" in several places). Examples: For "Screen Against Sanctions List," LLM has Transaction Analyst "R/A" only; ground truth spreads R/A/C/I across roles. No task has identical assignments.
- **Vocabulary and formatting issues**: While the LLM correctly uses mandated terms like "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst," it fails to strictly adhere to "only" those for all roles (by omitting Operations Manager) and adds non-mandated phrasing in tasks. The table header differs ("Activity / Task" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), and the LLM includes unnecessary introductory text and a bolded title, which the ground truth avoids. The legend is similar but positioned differently.
- **Overall fidelity to source and prompt**: The LLM covers the source steps but does not mirror the ground truth's interpretation (e.g., no separation of receive/log, missing distributed accountability). Small errors like inconsistent pluralization ("Transaction" vs. "Transactions") and over-assignment of "I" (e.g., Transaction Analyst "I" for archiving, unsupported by source) compound the issues.

These cumulative differences indicate poor alignment, justifying substantial point deduction even for minor variances.
