The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs that can run in parallel (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses one pair per line in the specified format. No extra or missing pairs, fully compliant with ignoring Process A and focusing only on Process B.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for small formatting differences from ground truth: (1) extra blank line between pairs (violates clean "one pair per line" presentation), (2) lack of leading space padding on the second line for monospace alignment of the "—" (as in ground truth). Under utmost strictness, these whitespace/presentation diffs count as small errors warranting a slight but significant loss, though content is pixel-perfect.
