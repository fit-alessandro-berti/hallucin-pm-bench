**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in verdict ("No" ≡ "inaccurate"/"false"), coverage of all three cases, key evidence (reversed order in 1001/1003; absence in 1002), and refutation of "always" and "immediately before." It adheres strictly to the prompt (short, cites case IDs/activities/sequences, data-based). Minor stylistic differences (e.g., no line numbers, which are not required; bolding sequences) are not errors and enhance clarity without deviation. No inaccuracies, guesses, or omissions.
