3.0

**Evaluation:**

- **R1:** Correctly marked as Compliant with sound justification.
- **R2:** Marked as Compliant in the LLM answer, but this is WRONG. The ground truth is Violated, because when a Change_Request follows approvals, a new approval is required and "Ship_Goods" must occur within 2 days after that latest approval (here, new Manager_Approval is after Ship_Goods). Significant error.
- **R3:** Marked as Compliant in the LLM answer, but this is WRONG. Ground truth clearly states Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) happens before Receive_Goods (2025-03-07). Major error.
- **R4:** Correctly marked as Not Applicable; matches ground truth.
- **R5:** Correctly marked as Violated, but the justification is slightly incorrect: in addition to Ship_Goods, Pay_Invoice also happened before the new Manager_Approval.
- **R6:** Correctly marked as Compliant.
- **Overall result:** Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).

**Major Issues:**  
- Two compliance rules (R2, R3) classified incorrectly as compliant instead of violated.  
- R5 justification missed multiple steps processed before new approval as required by the rule.
- The errors are substantial and demonstrate misunderstanding and/or inattention to trace/process sequence with respect to rule dependencies.

**Conclusion:**  
Severe penalties are warranted for the two misclassifications, plus smaller penalties for justification in R5. The overall result is lucky to be correct, but mostly by coincidence, not by correct reasoning. Thus, 3.0 is the appropriate strict score.
