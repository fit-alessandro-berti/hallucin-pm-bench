The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall NON-COMPLIANT status and accurately assesses R1, R4, R5 (status), and R6. However, it violates strict criteria with major errors: R2 incorrectly marked Compliant (ignores post-change new approval on 07-Mar, leading to Ship_Goods >2 days after final approval); R3 incorrectly marked Compliant (Pay_Invoice 06-Mar precedes Receive_Goods 07-Mar). Justifications for R2 and R3 are factually wrong, and R5 justification omits Pay_Invoice before new approval. Format has minor formatting issues (e.g., no space in "CompliantJustification"). These differences in two critical rules warrant significant deduction despite partial correctness.
