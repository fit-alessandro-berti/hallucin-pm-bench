**10.0**

The LLM answer produces a semantically equivalent BPMN 2.0 XML model to the ground truth and fully adheres to the prompt's requirements. It includes all explicitly mentioned flow elements as tasks with verbatim names (e.g., "validates the claim", "checks warranty eligibility", "send rejection notice", "Create shipment order"), uses the exact specified gateways (exclusive for completeness and warranty decision, parallel split/join pair), exactly two end events, wrc_-prefixed IDs, start event modeling submission, validation loop via gateway, parallel activities, sequential post-join steps, and no invented elements. Differences (e.g., IDs, namespace style/default vs. prefixed, gateway direction attributes, minor gateway/flow names, sequence flow names, process name attribute, unused DI namespaces, explicit incoming/outgoing refs) are superficial/allowed per the rubric for semantic equivalence and do not indicate hallucination, omission, or extras beyond the prompt. Task names match prompt verbatim precisely (better than ground truth's capitalizations/imperatives/omissions/additions). The included "checks warranty eligibility" task is required (explicit activity post-validation, like others), not hallucinated—ground truth omits it. Extra explanation text is labeled non-output; XML is self-contained/valid. No deductions warranted under strict rubric.
