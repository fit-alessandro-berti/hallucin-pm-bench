8.0

The LLM answer correctly identified all three differences and under the right headings, but there are notable strictness issues per your guidelines:

- In "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks", the LLM output only gave the element names/IDs (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`, `send_rma_label`), rather than the required detailed format (name and id).
- The gateway change is correctly identified—using IDs and element types (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway).
- The LLM also did not include any extraneous information, which is correct.

Loss of points is due to:
- Not providing the task names beside the IDs, as per ground truth ("Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)" etc. vs. only "`check_vip`").
- Minor format discrepancy (using inline code for IDs, lacking the more descriptive list formatting).

Therefore, a strict score is 8.0.
