**9.2**

The LLM answer matches the ground truth perfectly on all rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable for R1–R6) and overall result (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are all accurate, ≤20 words, and correctly explain violations/compliance based on the trace (e.g., R3 Pay before Receive; R5 Ship before new approval post-Change; R2 tied correctly to late final approval via R5). Minor differences: R5 omits Pay_Invoice (GT includes it, though Ship alone suffices); R2 emphasizes pre-approval timing over dates/2-days (both valid for violation); slight rephrasing/formatting (e.g., R1 €10000 vs. €10 000; no bolding; no violation list). No factual errors; format follows prompt precisely. High score reflects near-identity under strict criteria, with small phrasing gaps deducting 0.8.
