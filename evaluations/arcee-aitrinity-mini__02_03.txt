- Q1 matches the core answer (3 distinct cases) but omits "cases" phrasing and explicit list (C123, C456, C789); minor incompleteness vs. ground truth (-1.0).
- Q2 fully matches (Pack_Items, ignoring markdown escape).
- Q3 fully matches (Cancel_Order).
- Format: Numbered list vs. bulleted **A1** style is close but not identical; concise as prompted (-0.0 further deduction as minor).
- Overall correct and concise per prompt instructions.
