2.0

The LLM answer lists the correct task pairs—Create_Documentation — Quality_Check, and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines—which matches the ground truth.  
However, the answer duplicates both pairs, resulting in four lines, two for each valid pair (including swapping the order and omitting spaces in one instance).  
Per the instructions, answers must be alphabetized, list each unique pair only once (in alphabetical order within the pair and globally), and follow the specified formatting strictly.  
Repeating pairs (“Quality_Check — Create_Documentation” is just a reordering/duplication of “Create_Documentation — Quality_Check”) and inconsistent formatting (spacing and order) are significant errors.  
Therefore, though the core content is correct, substantial point loss is justified due to strict grading requirements:  
- Duplicates: major error  
- Formatting: moderate error  
- Alphabetical order: partial compliance  
Hence, 2.0 is appropriate.
