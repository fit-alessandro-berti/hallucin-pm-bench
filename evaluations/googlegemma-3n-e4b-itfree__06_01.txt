3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct identification of parallel pairs**: The LLM correctly identifies the two actual parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), matching the ground truth content. This earns partial credit (+3.0 base).
- **Major errors causing significant deduction**:
  - **Duplicates**: Lists each pair twice (total 4 lines instead of 2), violating the "every pair" implication of uniqueness and bloating the output (-2.0).
  - **Alphabetical ordering failures**: Within-pair error on the third line (Quality_Check — Create_Documentation is reversed; should start with "C" before "Q"). Overall list is not sorted (third line starts with "Q", disrupting sequence after "P") (-2.0).
  - **Format inconsistencies**: Fourth line lacks spaces around the em dash ("Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" vs. required "Task_X  —  Task_Y" with spaces), and inconsistent spacing overall (-1.0).
- **Strictness applied**: Even though the core pairs are correct, these are not "small" errors—they fundamentally alter the output structure, ordering, and cleanliness compared to the ground truth's precise 2-line format. No other pairs are invented (no further deduction), but the response fails to adhere strictly to the prompt's output rules.
