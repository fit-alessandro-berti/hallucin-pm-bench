7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the core facts matching the ground truth: 1 occurrence (Q1), 2.08% of events (Q2a), and 8.33% of cases (Q2b), with proper calculations. For Q3, it addresses the single occurrence, high variance, unreliability, overfitting, and risks of over-generalization from low support, aligning with required elements (i-iii), though less precise on specific metrics like cycle times or confidence intervals and somewhat generic.

However, deducting points for significant flaws: the response is a disorganized, verbose stream-of-consciousness with excessive internal reasoning, log reproduction, and repetitions, violating the analyst role's expectation of concise, data-only output. This makes it barely usable, like a draft rather than a professional answer. Small formatting/polish errors compound to major presentation issues under strict criteria.
