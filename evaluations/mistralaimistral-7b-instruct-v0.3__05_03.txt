**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically on multiple strict criteria: (1) adds new activities/events (e.g., `CatchEvent_SLA_CreateAccount` as an invalid intermediateCatchEvent mixing throw/catch/timer definitions, violating "no new activities"); (2) produces invalid BPMN 2.0 XML (non-standard `timerEventType`, erroneous nested definitions, undefined `messageRef`, `intermediateThrowEventDefinition` in a catch event); (3) incorrect timer duration (`P2D4H` ≠ 48h `PT48H`); (4) wrong timer attachment (post-gateway parallel path, not interrupting the target task from "Verify Identity" end); (5) ignores existing unused `Activity_AMReview` escalation path; (6) modifies unrelated `Flow_03` unnecessarily; (7) multi-sentence justification exceeding "one-sentence" limit and falsely claims no new activities; (8) non-interrupting design doesn't enforce SLA breach handling. Zero alignment with ground truth's precise, valid boundary timer + existing escalation reuse.
