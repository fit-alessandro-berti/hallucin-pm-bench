**2.0**

The LLM answer fails on core RACI content, with nearly all cells differing from the ground truth (24 cells total; only ~2-3 partial matches on R/A positions, e.g., Receive Application AM, Order Vetting AM, Notify Customer AM; all others mismatch, e.g., KYC Review assigns R,A to CO instead of R to CO + A to AM; widespread absence of C/I assignments). Headers add unwarranted abbreviations "(AM)" etc., absent in ground truth. All activity labels bolded (ground truth bolds only mandated terms). Extra title and legend constitute unwarranted content. Formatting variances (e.g., **R,A** vs. **R / A**). Vocabulary correct, activities/roles/columns correct (partial credit), but strict rubric demands near-exact match; major deviations warrant severe deduction.
