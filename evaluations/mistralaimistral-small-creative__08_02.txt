**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it wrongly claims "No" for Q1 (ground truth is "Yes"), provides a flawed explanation ignoring the T1→T2→T7→T4 path that enables P5 while preserving P2's token for T5 before T3, and fails to provide the required firing sequence. This inverts the core conclusion, misses the key enabling sequence, and violates the net's behavior entirely. No partial credit for format or word limit adherence given the strict evaluation criteria.
