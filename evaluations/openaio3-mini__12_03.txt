The LLM answer is fully accurate, correctly identifies "No" as the response, and provides a precise justification that cites all relevant CaseIDs (C001â€“C004) with accurate activity sequences, directly highlighting the violations in C002 and C004 while noting the compliance in C001 and C003. It matches the ground truth in substance, coverage, and logical conclusion without any factual errors, omissions, or deviations, despite minor stylistic differences (e.g., bullets vs. table). Under strict evaluation, no points are lost as the core requirements are met exactly.
