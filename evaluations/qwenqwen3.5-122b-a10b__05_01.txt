**4.0**

Major deviations from ground truth: attaches timer to wrong task (`Task_RequestDocs` vs `Task_Receive`), lacks specific timer ID (`Timer_48h`), omits BPMN XML syntax for duration (`PT48H` vs vague "48-hour duration"), and provides mismatched explanation (focuses on "document collection stalls" vs total time from submission). Structure and concept (interrupting boundary timer + new flow to `Task_Triage`) partially align, but core suggestion differs significantly, violating strict BPMN SLA enforcement as defined. Minor matches (plain English, ID refs, ≤120 words) insufficient to offset.
