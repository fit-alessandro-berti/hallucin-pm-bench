7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3). Accurately quotes both average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim from the table. No mention of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities. Memo format is crisp, executive-style, and under 150 words (~120 words).
- **Weaknesses (differences from ground truth, strict deductions)**: Actions differ entirely from ground truth (e.g., LLM proposes "automated document request system" vs. ground truth's "automated customer reminders with pilot tests"; similar mismatches for others). LLM actions promise ≥20% reductions but lack "data-driven" elements like pilots, estimates, or evidence cited in ground truth—appearing generic/invented. First action erroneously references "manual processing time" instead of waiting time (a conceptual error on the metric). Extra sections ("Immediate Action Required," signature) add unsubstantiated content absent in ground truth, inflating structure beyond the concise list format.
- **Overall**: Core facts match (70% weight), but action divergences and minor inaccuracies reduce score significantly per strict criteria. No criminal/jailbreak issues.
