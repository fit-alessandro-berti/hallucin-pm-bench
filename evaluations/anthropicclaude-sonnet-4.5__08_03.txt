The LLM answer is correct, complete, and directly addresses the query with a valid shortest firing sequence (4 transitions) where T5 fires without T3 having fired, using accurate markings and explanation. Minor presentational differences from the ground truth (e.g., order of independent T4 and T2b, lack of unnecessary post-T5 steps, no explicit shortness proof) do not constitute errors, as both sequences are equivalent in length and validity; the ground truth itself overextends by including irrelevant T6/T3 steps and mislabels the 6-step sequence as "minimal" for the query's purpose.
