**7.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict line-by-line assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Q1/A1**: Matches core fact ("3"), but adds unrequested listing of cases ("C001, C002, and C003") and introductory phrasing. Minor extra content = -0.5 deduction.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match (ignoring ground truth's LaTeX escaping `\_`, as LLM matches prompt naming). Perfect = full points.
- **Q3/A3**: Core distinct activities correct (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), but:
  - Violates "alphabetically ordered" (lists Check_Stock first, then Arrange_Delivery; alpha order is Arrange_Delivery → Check_Stock) = -1.5 deduction (direct instruction failure, not small error).
  - Adds unrequested/extra case attributions ("(for case C001)", "(for case C002)") = -1.0 deduction (extras treated as near-hallucination per instructions).
  - Format close (bullets, one per line) but polluted by extras.

Total: Starts at 10.0, deduct 3.0 total for Q3 failures + 0.5 minor extras elsewhere = 7.0. Utmost strictness applied; no leniency for partial correctness.
