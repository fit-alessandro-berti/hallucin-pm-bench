8.0

The LLM answer demonstrates a solid grasp of Acme’s loan-approval process, with only minor inaccuracies and stylistic deviations from the ground truth answer.

**a) Decision Points:**  
- The LLM answer correctly identifies both decision points:  
  1. The conditional branch after Tri-Color-Risk-Check is accurately described, including both criteria (risk category and amount).  
  2. The TriVote approval logic is stated correctly (two out of three to pass), and the requirement for the three specific roles is indicated.
- Minor point-loss: The LLM frames the TriVote as "requires any two approvals out of three to pass," which is slightly less precise than the ground truth's "the loan may advance only when at least two of the three approvers [...] record 'Approve'," but this distinction is very small. Otherwise, the summaries are faithful and concise.

**b) Required Documents:**  
- The list of required documents is fully accurate and in the correct order.
- The LLM includes Scorecards–Cyan/Magenta/Yellow as separate entries rather than as a group, but this strictly follows their mention in the process.
- No hallucinated documents are present.

**Stylistic/Structural Notes:**  
- The LLM structures its answer in a way that is slightly less formal than the ground truth but does not omit or invent any content.

**Overall:**  
Because the answer is essentially correct—with only minor wording and structure differences—it deserves a high score. However, per the instruction to be "utmost strict" and for "also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," the minor imprecision in phrasing and slight structural differences warrant a deduction of 2 points.

**Final Score: 8.0**
