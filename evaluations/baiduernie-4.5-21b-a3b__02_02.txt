6.0

Analysis:

Q1: **Score: 1.0/1.0**  
The LLM correctly identifies 3 distinct cases.  

Q2: **Score: 1.0/1.0**  
Sequence for C002 is in perfect order and formatting as expected.  

Q3: **Score: 4.0/8.0**  
**Major Error:** The LLM incorrectly includes "Ship_Order" as an activity that immediately precedes itself. Reviewing the event log:

- **C001:** …Check_Stock → Ship_Order (OK)
- **C002:** …Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order (OK)
- **C003:** …Check_Stock → Ship_Order (line 6 → 9) (not Ship_Order → Ship_Order; no evidence it follows itself)
- **No instance** where Ship_Order is immediately followed by another Ship_Order within the same case. The events are not repeated for a case.

**Ground truth correctly only lists:**  
- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock  

**The LLM hallucinated Ship_Order as a possible predecessor, likely by confusing indices or not strictly applying the case-stratified order.**  
This is a significant logical error, as it introduces an activity that cannot occur given the distinct cases and event ordering in the fragment.

**Formatting:** The answers are generally well-formatted, list items enumerated as required, and sequence separators are as requested.

**Summary:** Q1 and Q2 are correct and precise, but Q3 includes an extra, fabricated answer to the "immediately precedes" question (adds Ship_Order), a serious factual error per the scoring instructions.

**Deductions:**  
- Error in Q3 (hallucinated one of three returned): -4 points from a perfect 10.

**Final Score:** 6.0
