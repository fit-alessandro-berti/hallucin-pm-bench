5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Perfect match to ground truth (3 distinct cases). Full credit.
- **Q2**: Exact sequence match (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order), ignoring minor escaping differences in ground truth (e.g., backslashes for markdown). Full credit.
- **Q3**: Major errors. Includes fabricated "Ship_Order" as a preceding activity (no Ship_Order event precedes another Ship_Order in any case trace). Ground truth has only two items (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock); this adds an extra hallucinated item, misidentifies precedences in explanation (e.g., confuses line 8 as Ship_Order, wrongly attributes precedences), and violates factual precision. Alphabetical order is correct for its (wrong) list, but content failure dominates. Significant deduction for hallucination and inaccuracy.
- **Overall Structure/Format**: Clear, step-by-step response with final answers section is helpful but not required. Minor formatting differences (e.g., no bullets in list vs. ground truth's "- " and <br>) are negligible, but do not offset Q3 errors.
- **Strictness Applied**: Q1/Q2 earn ~5/10 total; Q3's hallucinations and fabrications (extra/missing precision) deduct heavily, treating as critical failure per instructions. Total reflects ~50% accuracy across questions.
