4.0

The LLM answer demonstrates several critical errors when compared to the ground truth and mandated policies. The grade reflects serious deviations, as detailed below:

**1. Vocabulary Violations (Policy Breaks, -3 points):**
- The LLM writes “Compliance Officer Approval”, “Payment Scheduling”, and “Fund Release and Notification” instead of the required activity names “Compliance Officer Approval” and "Release Funds".
- The LLM invents activities not explicitly named in the ground truth (e.g., "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release and Notification”), violating the instruction NOT to rename, merge or add activities.
- While “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, and “Risk Scoring” appear, the additional/renamed activity rows are not permitted.
- "Release Funds" is split and renamed (“Fund Release and Notification”).
 
**2. Inaccurate RACI Assignments (-2 points):**
- Several roles are inappropriately marked as “Consulted”, “Informed”, or even omitted, deviating from the ground truth.
    - “Intake Vetting”: Treasury Ops is not “I” (should be “I” per ground truth).
    - “KYC Review” and “AML Screening”: “C” is missing for Compliance Officer; “I” for Treasury Ops appears but is not fully correct per ground truth.
    - “Risk Scoring”: Compliance Analyst should be “R” and Compliance Officer “A”, but LLM gives both “R, A” to Compliance Analyst, and “C, I” to Compliance Officer.
    - “Compliance Officer Approval”: Treasury Ops marked “I”, should be “–”. LLM result splits “R, A” incorrectly.
    - “Release Funds”: Activity is renamed and merged.

**3. Activity Merging/Splitting (Critical Process Violation, -1 point):**
- LLM splits/renames activities ("Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release and Notification") without authorization, directly breaching the prompt instruction not to merge or rename activities.

**4. Formatting Note (Minor, -0.5):**
- The LLM’s table lacks boldface for activity names, which, while minor, is a formatting deviation from the ground truth.

Given these significant errors—especially the policy-violating activity renaming and incorrect RACI role assignments—the answer receives a strict 4.0. The most egregious issue is the unauthorized change to the activity list, which cannot be overlooked.
