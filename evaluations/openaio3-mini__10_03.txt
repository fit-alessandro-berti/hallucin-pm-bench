### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer shows partial adherence to the prompt but contains significant deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Structural Errors (Major Deduction, ~4 points loss)**: The prompt forbids renaming, merging, or adding activities. The LLM adds "Payment Scheduling" as a new row (not present in ground truth) and splits the final narrative step into "Payment Scheduling" and "Fund Release and Notification," while ground truth consolidates it as "Release Funds." This results in 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6, introducing unauthorized activities.

- **RACI Assignment Inaccuracies (Major Deduction, ~2 points loss)**: Numerous cell-level differences across all rows, deviating from ground truth:
  - Intake Vetting: Compliance Analyst (I vs. C); Treasury Ops (empty vs. I).
  - KYC Review: Front-Office Analyst (C vs. –); Compliance Officer (I vs. C).
  - AML Screening: Identical errors to KYC Review.
  - Risk Scoring: Front-Office Analyst (empty vs. C); Compliance Analyst (R,A vs. R); Compliance Officer (C,I vs. A).
  - Compliance Officer Approval: Treasury Ops (I vs. –).
  - Fund Release and Notification (maps to Release Funds): Compliance Analyst (empty vs. C); Compliance Officer (I vs. C).
  These affect ~70% of cells, with incorrect roles (e.g., over-assigning I/C where ground truth uses –).

- **Formatting and Style Errors (Moderate Deduction, ~1 point loss)**: No bolding for R,A as in ground truth. Uses empty cells instead of dashes (–) for no involvement, violating the key point on dashes. Includes unnecessary commas (e.g., "C,I") not in ground truth. Markdown table is functional but lacks ground truth's exact styling (e.g., bolded headers/activities).

- **Strengths (Minimal Credit)**: Correctly uses the four mandated terms exactly (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. Covers all roles. Includes "Compliance Officer Approval" matching ground truth.

Overall, while vocabulary is compliant, the additions, splits, and pervasive RACI/formatting errors create substantial divergence, justifying a score well below passing under utmost strictness.
