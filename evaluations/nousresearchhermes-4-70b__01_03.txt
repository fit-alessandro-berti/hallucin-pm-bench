7.5

**Evaluation:**

a) **Decision Points**

- The LLM answer identifies both key decision points/gates with high accuracy, clearly summarizing the conditions and rules. The logic for skipping Manual Underwriting Review is correct and concise. The description of the TriVote gate is clear and matches the requirement that any two out of three approvals allow passing.
- Minor deduction: While the explanations are correct and one-sentence, the answer does not specify "the process bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise it proceeds to that review" as explicitly as the ground truth, though that's implied by saying "is skipped." However, severity is low.

b) **Required Documents (Order of Appearance)**

- The LLM lists:  
  1. Form 14B  
  2. Scorecard–Cyan  
  3. Scorecard–Magenta  
  4. Scorecard–Yellow  
  5. Deck Memo  
  6. Offer Sheet 77  
  7. ID Matrix Declaration  
  8. Loan Dossier 2025  

- **Errors:**  
    - **Misses "Signed Offer Sheet 77"** as a separate, required document (distinct from Offer Sheet 77).
    - **Lists "ID Matrix Declaration" before "Signed Offer Sheet 77"**, whereas in the ground truth, the signed version comes first—this slightly affects sequence accuracy.
- These are significant content and order errors.

**No hallucinations** are present; no imaginary documents are listed.

**Summary of deduction:**
- Nearly perfect for (a): –0.5
- Omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77" and mis-sequencing documents in (b): –2.0

**Final Score:** 7.5/10
