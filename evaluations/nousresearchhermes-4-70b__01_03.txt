7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: The LLM accurately identifies both decision points (the risk-based conditional skip after step 3 and the TriVote gate in step 6) and describes their rules in one concise sentence each, closely matching the ground truth in content and logic. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., naming "Risk-Based Bypass Gate" vs. "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; phrasing "at least two approvals" vs. "at least two...record 'Approve'") are negligible under strict criteria, as the core rules are preserved without alteration or omission. Full credit here.
- **Part (b)**: The list is incomplete and partially inaccurate. It correctly identifies 8 of the 9 required documents in mostly correct first-appearance order but omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (explicitly listed in step 8 as a distinct required document, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7). This shifts the order (e.g., "ID Matrix Declaration" appears too early as item 7 instead of 8). No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML items), but the omission of a required document constitutes a significant error, warranting a substantial deduction. The score balances near-perfection in (a) against clear incompleteness in (b).
