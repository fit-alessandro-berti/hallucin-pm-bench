3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology Compliance (Strong, +2.0)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear, fully aligning with the vocabulary policy.
- **Structure and Format (Partial, +1.5)**: Basic table structure (activities as rows, roles as columns) is present, with no extra tasks, roles, or unwarranted content. However, it uses abbreviations (AM, CO, etc.) instead of full role names (e.g., "Account Manager"), and lacks bolding/formatting from the ground truth, reducing clarity and fidelity.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Deficiencies, -6.0)**: This is the core failure. The ground truth provides a complete RACI matrix with explicit assignments (R, A, C, I) for *every* role in *every* activity, reflecting nuanced involvement (e.g., AM as R/A on multiple steps; CO consulted on several). The LLM only assigns *Responsible* (R) roles—correctly identifying the primary performer per the process narrative—but omits *Accountable* (A), *Consulted* (C), and *Informed* (I) entirely, leaving most cells blank. This renders it an incomplete RACI matrix, not a full one. Each activity has exactly one R (matching rubric intent), and AM accountability is implied but not shown. Strict rubric docking for not reflecting the full narrative-derived allocations.
- **Overall Correctness and Self-Awareness (Low, -0.5 adjustment)**: No extras or deviations in content scope, but the partial implementation ignores the comprehensive nature of RACI as per ground truth. N/A for self-awareness.

Total reflects utmost strictness: Basic compliance earns minimal credit, but significant omissions in completeness and detail (far from ground truth fidelity) warrant heavy penalties.
