6.0

The LLM's answer demonstrates a partial grasp of both the terminology policy and the RACI allocation. Here's a strict breakdown:

**Positive Aspects:**
- The LLM correctly uses the mandated synonyms: "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance."
- The forbidden synonyms do not appear, even in alternate forms or explanations.
- No extraneous roles, tasks, or clarifications are added.

**Major Issues:**
- The RACI allocation is incomplete and too simplistic: for each activity, the LLM assigns only a single 'R' (Responsible), and leaves all other cells blank, i.e., it omits 'A' (Accountable), 'C' (Consulted), or 'I' (Informed) designations.
- The matrix column headings use abbreviations ("AM," "CO," etc.) rather than the required full role names.
- In the ground truth, both 'R' and 'A' (e.g. "R/A") are often assigned to the Account Manager, but these are never shown in the LLM matrix.
- The LLM leaves all non-Responsible cells blank, instead of putting the correct RACI letters as per the ground truth (i.e., 'A', 'C', 'I').
- In the ground truth, almost every activity has multiple stakeholders (e.g., Consulted and Informed parties); these are missing.
- The LLM does not use boldface for the synonyms, but this seems minor compared to the other omissions.

**Consequences:**
- The answer fundamentally misrepresents the process by under-reporting cross-role involvement and does not implement RACI properly.
- Terminology policy is fulfilled, but the execution of the RACI matrix structure is significantly lacking.

**Summary:**
- Adhered strictly to the vocabulary policy (no forbidden terms).
- Major loss of points because the RACI matrix is shallow (structure is thin, with missing Accountable/Consulted/Informed parties and role names abbreviated).
- Significant errors: missing required information, improper column headings, and incomplete allocations.

Therefore, the answer gets **6.0**; it demonstrates the right terminology but a substantially incomplete and inaccurate RACI implementation per the supplied ground truth.
