5.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part 1**: Exact match (both correctly identify 1 occurrence). No deduction here.
- **Part 2**: Partial credit for noting the small sample size (3 cases) and non-representative nature, which could lead to underestimation. However, significant deductions for: (1) omitting key quantitative details from ground truth (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours span, frequency swing from 0% to ~7% per case, wide confidence intervals, sampling error for rare events); (2) ignoring the critical issue of near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and strict vs. fuzzy string matching confusion; (3) introducing speculation (e.g., "thousands of cases", "risk factors not evident") violating the "no speculation" rule; (4) lacking precision on needing a larger/random sample for reliability. Explanation is generally accurate but superficial and incomplete, warranting a ~50% score for this section. Overall average yields 5.0 under strict criteria.
