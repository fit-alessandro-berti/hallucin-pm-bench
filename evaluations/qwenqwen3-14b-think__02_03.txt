10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct in content for all three questions, matching the ground truth precisely on the key facts (number of cases, preceding activity, and unique activity). The slight conciseness in Q1 (omitting the case list, which the question does not require) aligns with the prompt's instruction for "concise, bullet-point answers only" and introduces no factual error. Format is appropriate with bullets.
