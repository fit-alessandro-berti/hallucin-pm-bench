9.0

- The LLM answer gives correct and precise responses to all three questions, matching the intent and information of the ground truth.  
- The only minor error is the lack of case IDs in the first answer (e.g., it should be "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)" rather than just "3"), which is a missing detail. The rest is perfectly aligned.
- Because your instructions ask for utmost strictness, this omission should result in a significant, but not huge, loss of points.  
- Therefore, a 9.0 is appropriate.
