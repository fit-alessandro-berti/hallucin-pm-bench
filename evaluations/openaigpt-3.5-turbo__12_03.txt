The LLM answer is factually perfect: correctly identifies "No" with accurate case-by-case analysis of all relevant cases (C001–C004), cites exact intervening activities (Pack_Items for C002, Check_Fraud for C004), and properly justifies why "always" fails due to counterexamples. No factual errors, hallucinations, or omissions—all sequences match the log and ground truth logic.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for stylistic differences from ground truth: 
- Bullet prose vs. tabular format (less visually structured/parsable).
- No explicit "Answer:" label or quantification ("two out of four").
- Verbal descriptions vs. symbolic arrows (→) in sequences.

These are small presentational variances, not content errors, but per strictness directive, they warrant a slight penalty despite full compliance with prompt requirements (Yes/No + CaseID/sequence justification).
