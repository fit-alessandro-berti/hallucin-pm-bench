The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two exact sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order they appear in Process B, with no extraneous information about other processes and full semantic accuracy. However, under utmost strictness:  
- Formatting differences (plain text with "and" vs. bolded "Set X – [descriptive name]:", backticks, and ‖ symbol) are non-trivial stylistic mismatches (-0.5).  
- Absence of the confirmatory "No other tasks..." sentence (-0.5), which explicitly closes the response in ground truth despite not being strictly prompted.  
No factual errors, making it very strong but not identical.
