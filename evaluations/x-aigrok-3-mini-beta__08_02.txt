The LLM answer correctly answers "yes" to Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence as the ground truth, with a valid, concise explanation under the word limit that demonstrates T5 firing before T3 while P2 remains available. However, it omits the step-by-step markings (M1â€“M5) that explicitly verify reachable states and the post-T5 disabling of T3, reducing detail compared to the ground truth. Minor structural differences (explanation placement) and phrasing (e.g., "enable P2" vs. full path) warrant a strict deduction despite overall accuracy.
