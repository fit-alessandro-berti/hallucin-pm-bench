**Evaluation:**

- **Q1:** The answer is correct ("Yes"), and it also states this clearly.
- **Q2:** The firing sequence given ([T1, T2, T7, T4, T5]) is minimal and correct, matching the ground truth sequence. The explanation is accurate and concise: it specifies that T5 fires before T3, after necessary preconditions are met.
- **Detailed Marking Comparison:**  
  - The ground truth answer provides the explicit marking after each transition, which the LLM answer omits. This explicit marking gives extra clarity and confidence, especially for technically rigorous contexts.
  - The ground truth explicitly notes that after T5 fires, T3 is disabled—a subtle but important detail, as it helps explain the irreversible ordering in the scenario.
  - The LLM answer says: "allowing T5 to fire while P2 is still available and before T3 consumes it." This is correct but less specific than the ground truth’s attention to transition disabling.
- **Brevity/Clarity:** The LLM answer is clear, concise, and under 120 words as required.

**Points lost (−0.8):**  
Mainly for omitting the step-wise marking changes, and not explicitly stating that T3 is disabled after T5, as done in the reference. This lack of explicit marking analysis could be important for strict, technical audiences or in educational settings.  

**Overall:** The answer is fully correct in logic and sequence, but lacks some of the detailed, stepwise marking justification in the ground truth.
