9.0

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth: it correctly answers "No", gives detailed case-by-case justification, and clearly cites which cases violate the rule. It analyzes the sequences for each CaseID and provides a textual justification for each.

Strictly, there are two small differences or minor omissions compared to the ground truth:
- The ground truth presents a clear tabular summary, including an explicit "Immediate successor?" column and summary notes for each case. The LLM delivers the same information in a more narrative form but not in a structured table.
- The ground truth explicitly mentions "two out of four cases" at the end, concisely quantifying the failures, which provides extra clarity.

These differences are minor but, per the instruction for utmost strictness and to penalize small lapses, a 1-point deduction is warranted. Therefore, the strict score is **9.0**.
