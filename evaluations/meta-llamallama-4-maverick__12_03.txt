The LLM answer is substantively correct, accurately concluding "No" and correctly identifying compliant (C001, C003) and non-compliant (C002, C004) cases with appropriate sequences cited in the justification, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning. However, deductions are applied for minor issues under strict evaluation: (1) slight imprecision in wording for C001 ("occurs after" instead of explicitly "immediately," though the sequence implies it correctly); (2) a visible typo/formatting error ("## Step ## Step 3:" ); and (3) differences in presentation (step-by-step prose with a boxed answer vs. ground truth's concise table), which introduce unnecessary verbosity without enhancing clarity. These small errors warrant a significant but not severe point loss from a perfect score.
