**5.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact three worst-performing activities matching ground truth (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment). Stays ≤200 words (~160). References only table data, no hallucinations or absent activities.
- **Major Deficiencies (significant deductions)**:
  1. **Incomplete explanations** (core task violation, -2.5 pts): 
     - Request_Documents: Cites only wait time (150 min); **ignores** throughput drop (190, key drop-off), massive rework (22%, highest by 4x+), SLA (5.5%). Ground truth cites all three.
     - Review_Documents: Cites proc (25 min, correct) and rework (5.3%, but calls "sizeable" – misleading vs. 22%; ignores highest SLA 12.4%, wait 30 min, stdev 9). Ground truth covers proc/wait/SLA.
     - Initial_Assessment: Cites wait (18 min) and SLA (3.2%); **ignores** proc (12 min). Ground truth links all + upstream impact.
  2. **Weak recommendations** (-1.5 pts): Vague/generic ("automated system", "training programs", "review and streamline") vs. ground truth's concrete/data-driven ("automatic same-day digital requests with validation", "AI-assisted + specialist squad", "triage rule-engine"). No measurable ties or projections.
  3. **Minor flaws** (-0.8 pts): Fluffy structure (greeting/sign-off/redundant list) dilutes conciseness vs. ground truth's punchy format. "Decent throughput" for Initial contradicts bottleneck rationale without upstream justification.
- **Overall**: Matches selection but ~50% divergence in precision/depth of explanations/recs. Strict rubric demands *strictly table-based* full justification and *concrete data-driven* actions – unfulfilled.
