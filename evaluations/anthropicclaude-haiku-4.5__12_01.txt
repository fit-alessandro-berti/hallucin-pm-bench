10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in verdict, structure, coverage of all three cases, factual accuracy (correct sequences, timestamps vs. line references are equivalent), and justification logic (reversed ordering, absence in Case 1002 disproving "always," and summary of non-occurrence). No errors, omissions, or deviations present.
