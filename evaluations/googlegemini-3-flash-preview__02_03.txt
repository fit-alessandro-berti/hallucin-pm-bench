**8.5**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (Distinct cases)**: Correct count (3) and lists cases accurately, but phrasing differs slightly ("Distinct cases: 3 (C123, C456, **and** C789)" vs. "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"); uses descriptive label instead of "**A1:**". Minor deduction (-0.3).
- **Q2 (Preceding activity for C456 Ship_Order)**: Correct ("Pack_Items"), but adds unrequested timestamp "(at 09:35:00)". Violates conciseness. Deduction (-0.7).
- **Q3 (Activity exactly once)**: Exact match ("Cancel_Order"). No deduction.
- **Overall structure**: Bullet points used (good), but adds unnecessary intro ("Based on the analysis..."), violating "concise, bullet-point answers only"; labels paraphrase questions instead of using "**A1:** / **A2:** / **A3:**" format. Further deductions (-0.5 total).
- Content is fully correct after chronological sorting (verified: 3 cases; Pack_Items precedes Ship_Order in C456 at 09:35 before 09:40; Cancel_Order unique). High base score, but strict penalties for extras/formatting per instructions.
