9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match (1). Full points.
- **Question 2**: Exact match on the percentage (5.56%) and core calculation logic. The additional explanatory text is accurate and derived from the log (18 events total). Full points.
- **Question 3**: Correct identifier (A1002), with no extras or errors. However, minor deduction for lacking the ground truth's fuller phrasing ("Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”"), which provides clearer context without inference—slight incompleteness under strictness.
- **Question 4**: Provides two clear, sampling-related reasons directly tied to the log data (small sample size with temporal element; unknown selection leading to bias). These align well with ground truth options (e.g., small sample size; case-mix/representativeness bias). No hallucinations or unjustified inferences. Minor deduction for not explicitly matching one of the verbatim examples (e.g., no direct mention of "high variance" or "temporal bias" phrasing), though "any two stated clearly" is satisfied—strictness applied for phrasing precision.

Overall, the response is highly accurate, adheres to the system prompt (no assumptions beyond the 18 lines), and shows no major deviations. Minor wording/format differences prevent a perfect 10.0.
