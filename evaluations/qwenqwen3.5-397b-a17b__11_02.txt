### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely mirrors the ground truth in structure (concise memo ≤200 words), selection of the exact same three activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), and adherence to table-only data (e.g., accurate cites of wait times, processing times, stdev, rework, SLA, throughput drops). Explanations are strictly table-based, causal (e.g., throughput drops, upstream comparisons), and pinpoint key issues without hallucination. Actions are concrete and data-driven (targeting specific metrics like rework, variability, queues).

**Minor deductions (-0.8 total):**
- Factual inaccuracy: "Next highest SLA breach (3.2%)" for Initial_Assessment is wrong—Request_Documents has 5.5% (second highest after Review_Documents' 12.4%). Wording implies second-place ranking despite context.
- Slightly less emphasis on Review_Documents' 30-min wait (omitted, unlike ground truth).
- Actions valid but less precise/measurable than ground truth (e.g., no quantified targets like "halve rework").

High fidelity overall; error is small but impacts "strictly on the table" precision per rubric.
