8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong overall (captures all 3 decision points accurately in content and lists all 6 required documents completely without omissions or additions), but loses points under utmost strictness for multiple small differences vs. ground truth:

**Decision Points (-1.5 points total):**
- Added unnecessary step numbers "(Step 5)", "(Step 7)", "(Step 8)" (GT omits).
- Missing precise contextual phrasing: "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" (GT specifies explicitly).
- Phrasing variances: "differ by more than 2 points" vs. GT's "differ by ≤ 2"; "routed to the **Micro-loan Board**" vs. "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval"; "less than €15,000" / "€15,000 or more" vs. "< €15 000" / "≥ €15 000" (currency formatting, no comma/space match).
- Formatting/title: "**Decision Points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**" + descriptive sentences vs. GT's concise "#### Decision points" + bullet-style specs.
- "*approve* or *reject*" (lowercase italic) vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**" (capitalized bold).

**Required Documents (-0.5 points total):**
- Bullet list (▪) vs. GT's numbered (1-6).
- Minor phrasing: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)".
- Missing GT's closing note: "*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*".
- Title: "**Every Required Document:**" vs. "#### Required documents (complete list)".

No major errors (e.g., all activity names exact, no standard terminology introduced, all points/documents complete), so high base score, but strict deduction for cumulative small discrepancies in phrasing, structure, and extras.
