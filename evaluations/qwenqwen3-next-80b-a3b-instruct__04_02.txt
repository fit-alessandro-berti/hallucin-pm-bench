6.5

Rationale:  
- R1: Correct (Compliant), though justification could be clearer about "for amount > €10 000". Minor wording issue.
- R2: Incorrect justification. The answer claims Ship_Goods is late, but it actually ships within 2 days of the **original** approvals. However, ground-truth considers the need for a new approval after the change (R5). The LLM answer doesn't mention that Ship_Goods is too early relative to this new approval (which is the true violation). So the rationale is a bit off, but the verdict is correct—significant clarity error, moderate point loss.
- R3: Correct; brief and accurate.
- R4: Marked “Compliant” instead of “Not Applicable” (as in ground truth). This is a deviation—smaller, but nontrivial.
- R5: Correct conclusion, but not explicit about **both** Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice happening before new Manager_Approval—wording slightly unclear, but overall meaning is intact.
- R6: Correct.
- Overall: Correct.

Major errors:
- R2 and R4 justifications insufficient or off-target.
- Slight technical phrasing/accuracy off for R1/R5.

Under strict grading, these small but compounding errors (especially justification imprecision or failure to note key logical chains) justify reducing to 6.5.
