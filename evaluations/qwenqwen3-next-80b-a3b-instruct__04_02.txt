6.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **R1**: Status matches (Compliant). Justification similar but slightly imprecise (no direct mention of amount threshold). Minor deduction.
- **R2**: Status matches (Violated), but justification fundamentally incorrectâ€”misidentifies last approval as 03-04 instead of 03-07 post-change, showing misunderstanding of R5 interaction. Major deduction for flawed reasoning.
- **R3**: Status and justification match exactly. No deduction.
- **R4**: Status incorrect (Compliant vs. Not Applicable); rule condition unmet, so N/A required. Significant deduction for wrong categorization.
- **R5**: Status matches (Violated). Justification close but imprecise (omits Pay_Invoice; phrasing awkward). Moderate deduction.
- **R6**: Status and justification match. No deduction.
- **Overall**: Matches (NON-COMPLIANT). Format follows prompt (list style acceptable vs. ground truth table).
- **Strictness Notes**: 4/6 rules have errors (2 major: R2 justification, R4 status). Total reflects partial accuracy but critical flaws in compliance logic, per utmost strictness. Word limits met.
