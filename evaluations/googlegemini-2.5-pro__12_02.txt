The LLM answer correctly states "No", aligning exactly with the expected response. The justification is accurate and explicitly references both case-id C003 (lines 6 and 7) and case-id C005 (line 11) as counterexamples, as required. The phrasing is essentially equivalent to the ground truth and well-structured.

However, there is a minor error: in C005, the answer states "*Validate_Payment* occurs (line 11) without being preceded by a *Receive_Order* event at all." While strictly correct, it would be more precise to state that *Receive_Order* does not appear for C005 at all, mimicking the exact clarity and phrasing of the gold-standard that mentions the total absence ("never contains"). This is a subtle difference in emphasis and detail. Another slight point: the LLM says "multiple counterexamples," whereas only two cases are relevant, and the term could have been tighter.

Due to these small stylistic differences, 1 point is deducted for utmost strictness.
