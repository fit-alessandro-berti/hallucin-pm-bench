1.0

The LLM answer produces an invalid and semantically incorrect BPMN 2.0 XML document. Key failures include: no defined `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>` elements, resulting in malformed connections (e.g., `<bpmn:outgoing>` and `<bpmn:incoming>` reference element IDs instead of flow IDs, creating self-loops and invalid paths); incorrect process flow (e.g., validation loop is backwards and non-functional, with "wrc_validate_claim" task incompletely connected and warranty check hallucinated as an extra self-referencing task after the gateway); omission of required tasks (e.g., no "Send rejection notice" task, merged into end event; no separate "Close the claim" task); non-verbatim task names (e.g., "validates the claim" instead of matching description text like "A service agent validates the claim"); extra/hallucinated elements (e.g., unnecessary tasks like "wrc_warranty_eligible" and misnamed gateways); and inclusion of incomplete, erroneous `<bpmndi>` diagram elements not required by the prompt. This deviates substantially from the ground truth's minimal, correct structure with explicit sequence flows, proper validation loop, parallel activities, and exact element set, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
