**8.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies all verifiable functional changes: 3 added tasks, 1 removed task, and 2 gateway type changes, with exact IDs, names, and old→new types matching v1 vs v2 XML. No extras, no omissions, no commentary—perfect compliance with content rules.

However, under utmost strictness:
- Missing '-' bullets on all 6 items (-1.0 total).
- Incorrect inclusion of guillemets « » on both gateways (misreads prompt example; -0.5).
- No alignment spaces on second gateway (-0.2).
- Minor spacing/formatting after headings (plain lines vs bulleted; -0.3).

Content 10/10, format deductions yield 8.0.
