3.5

The LLM answer earns a low score due to a critical functional error in using a non-interrupting boundary event (cancelActivity="false"), which allows the "Create Account" task to continue beyond the 48-hour SLA without cancellation, failing to enforce the deadline strictlyâ€”unlike the ground truth's interrupting event (cancelActivity="true"); additional minor deductions for omitting the xsi:type attribute, lacking a name on the boundary event, using generic IDs, and a justification that inaccurately describes "parallel escalation" instead of proper interruption and routing.
