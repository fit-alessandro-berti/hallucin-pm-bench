The LLM answer identifies the three main decision points correctly but introduces a major factual error by misnaming "Shadow Underwriter B" as "Senior Underwriter B" (directly contradicting the prompt's terminology). It also paraphrases the conditions inaccurately (e.g., "more than 2 points" instead of exact "≤ 2"; vague "proceeds further" instead of specifying escalation to "Final Micro-loan Board Approval"; omits contextual placements like "after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). The structure uses plain-text bullets rather than the ground truth's Markdown headers and numbered lists with concise arrow-based logic (⇒). For required documents, the list is complete but deviates in phrasing (e.g., includes extraneous "old" in "(≤ 3 months old)", "single ... or" in "(single pay-stub or tax slip)", and "template" in "(CIS) template", while ground truth abbreviates precisely; omits the ground truth's closing note emphasizing no standard documents). These cumulative differences, including the terminology violation and lack of exact matching, warrant a low score under strict evaluation criteria.
