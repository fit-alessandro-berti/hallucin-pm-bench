The LLM answer accurately refuses to provide a numeric value, as required by the system prompt, and clearly states that the requested average cycle time cannot be derived due to the absence of timestamp or duration data. It correctly references the redaction of elapsed-time fields and notes the inapplicability of the historical benchmarks (which exclude "Review Contract" and are from a different segment). This aligns closely with the ground truth's emphasis on the lack of temporal information preventing any computation, without fabricating details or introducing errors. The explanation is concise, evidence-based, and responsive to the query's structure (addressing both the value and the calculation explanation).
