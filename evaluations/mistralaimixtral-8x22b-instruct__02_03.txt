9.5

- Q1 matches ground truth almost exactly (minor wording "distinct" and ":" vs "("; lists cases identically).
- Q2 correctly identifies "Pack_Items" but includes unnecessary restatement of question (less concise than ground truth).
- Q3 correctly identifies "Cancel_Order" but adds explanatory phrase (less concise than ground truth).
- Overall: Fully accurate content, bullet-point format followed, but slight verbosity and numbering/format diffs (A1 vs 1., * vs -, bold/quoting variances) deduct minimally under strict criteria.
