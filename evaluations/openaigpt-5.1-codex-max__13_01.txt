**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match in factual content, precision, and adherence to the log data for questions 1-3, with no hallucinations or inferences beyond the 18 lines. For Q4, it provides two clear, accurate sampling-related reasons (small sample size with variance/selection bias details; temporal bias via short time window) that directly align with two of the ground truth examples ("small sample size" and "temporal bias"), stated clearly without deviation. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., Q2 lacks explicit calculation notation but equivalents "1 out of 18"; Q3 wording implies singularity equivalently) are stylistic and do not alter meaning or introduce error under strict evaluation.
