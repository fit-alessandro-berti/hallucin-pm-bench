The LLM answer is highly accurate, directly matching the ground truth in structure (starting with "No" followed by a single-paragraph justification), key counter-examples (C003 lines 6-7, C005 line 11 with no Receive_Order), and overall reasoning that *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order*. Minor phrasing differences, such as adding "often follows" (which is factually correct based on other cases but not in the ground truth), do not introduce errors or omissions, preserving full fidelity under strict evaluation.
