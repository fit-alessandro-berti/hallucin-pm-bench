The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly for Q1-Q4. For Q5, it incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" among the activities that never appear as the first event in any case; in fact, "Quality_Check" is the first and only event for case "C-77". Thus, Q5 is slightly overinclusive, with one extra element not in the ground truth, which merits a notable penalty, but the rest of the answer is otherwise perfect.
