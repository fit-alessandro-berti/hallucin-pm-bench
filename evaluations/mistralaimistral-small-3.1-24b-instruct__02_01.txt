8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Matches ground truth (3 distinct case IDs: A-9321, B-1045, C-77). Perfect.
- **Q2**: Matches ground truth ("Pack_Items" precedes "Ship_Order" in A-9321). Perfect.
- **Q3**: Matches ground truth (earliest timestamp is 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00 from A-9321's Receive_Order). Perfect.
- **Q4**: Matches ground truth ("Quality_Check" occurs 2 times: B-1045 and C-77). Perfect.
- **Q5**: Partial match. Ground truth lists ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"] as activities never appearing as first events. LLM correctly identifies three but incorrectly includes "Quality_Check" (which is the first and only event for case C-77, as confirmed by timestamps and case reconstruction). This is a clear factual error, misinterpreting the shuffled log's case starts. Under strict evaluation, the extraneous and incorrect item represents a significant deviation, warranting deduction despite the partial accuracy.

Overall, four questions are flawless, but Q5's error (adding an invalid activity to the list) reduces the score from a potential 10.0 to 8.0, reflecting the "utmost strictness" for any deviation from ground truth.
