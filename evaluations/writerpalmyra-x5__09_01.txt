The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in refusing to provide a numeric value, correctly stating the impossibility due to absent timestamps/elapsed-time data, and providing a brief, accurate explanation structured to match the query's numbering. Minor phrasing variations ("derived" vs. "computed"; omission of "ordering" or "fabricated" which are implicit/redundant here) do not constitute errors under the data constraints or system role, as both fully adhere to the policy of only answering supportable queries.
