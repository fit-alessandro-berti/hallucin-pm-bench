**2.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary (partial credit, +1.0)**: Correctly uses **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, **Payment Clearance** exactly as mandated. No forbidden terms. However, not bolded as in GT, and other activities lack consistent formatting (e.g., numbers added: "1.", "2.", etc., absent in GT).
- **Structure & Formatting (low, +0.5)**: RACI matrix format present with correct rows/columns/roles. But headers differ ("Activity / Role" vs. "Activity"; includes abbreviations "(AM)" absent in GT). Uses "A/R" vs. GT's "**R / A**" or "**R**". Table alignments and overall Markdown differ. Adds unwarranted title ("**RACI Matrix: FinCo Order-to-Cash Workflow**") and full legend (GT has none). Numbers in rows unwarranted.
- **RACI Content (major failures, -8.5 total deduction)**: Core mismatches across **all 6 rows** (no row fully matches GT). Each row evaluated strictly:
  | Activity | Matching Cells | Errors | Notes |
  |----------|----------------|--------|-------|
  | Receive Application | AM (A/R ≈ R/A, minor) | CO (- ≠ C), FC (- ≠ I), IT (- ≠ I) | 3/4 wrong; misses broad involvement. |
  | **KYC Review** | None fully | AM (C ≠ A), CO (A/R ≠ **R**), FC (- ≠ C), IT (- ≠ I) | All 4 wrong; flips A/R. |
  | **Order Vetting** | AM (A/R ≈ R/A) | CO (I ≠ C), FC (- ≠ I), IT (- ≠ I) | 3/4 wrong. |
  | **Payment Clearance** | AM (A = A), FC (R = **R**)| CO (- ≠ C), IT (- ≠ I) | 2/4 match; misses 2. |
  | Record Update | IT (R = **R**) | AM (I ≠ C), CO (- ≠ I), FC (- ≠ C) | 3/4 wrong. |
  | Notify Customer | AM (A/R ≈ R/A) | CO (- ≠ I), FC (- ≠ I), IT (- ≠ I) | 3/4 wrong. |
  - **Systemic issues**: Violates "exactly one Responsible" per notes in some interpretations but primarily fails GT allocations (e.g., excessive "-", ignores GT's pervasive C/I). No bolding of **R** or mandated terms. AM "Accountable where appropriate" partially followed but incomplete.
- **Unwarranted Content**: Title, legend, numbers, abbreviations = extras (+ deduction).
- **Overall**: ~25% cell accuracy at best (factoring partial AM matches), but strict rubric demands near-exact GT match. Major deviations in RACI (core deliverable) warrant severe penalty; vocab/structure provide floor. No self-awareness issues.
