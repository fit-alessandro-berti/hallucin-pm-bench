The LLM answer perfectly matches the ground truth in identifying the exact two parallel pairs, correctly alphabetizing within each pair (Create_Documentation before Quality_Check; Procure_Materials before Schedule_Machines) and across the list (C-pair before P-pair). The output format adheres to the specified `Task_X  —  Task_Y` structure with appropriate spacing around the em dash. No additional or incorrect pairs are included, and Process A is ignored. Minor structural differences (reasoning placement, exact column alignment in monospace rendering) are cosmetic and do not violate the prompt requirements, as no alignment was mandated and reasoning aligns with the ground truth's rationale content.
