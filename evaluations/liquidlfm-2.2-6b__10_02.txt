The LLM answer fails catastrophically across all criteria, warranting the minimum score. Key violations include:

- **Vocabulary mandate ignored entirely**: Uses forbidden terms like "Payment clerk" (multiple times, should be "Transaction Analyst"), "Compliance Officer" (multiple times, should be "Regulatory Liaison"), and "KYC Review" only once but inconsistently; invents unrelated roles (e.g., "Controller", "KYC Review Approvals Lead", "Controlling Manager") instead of sticking to mandated or source terms.
- **RACI format inverted and invalid**: Standard RACI (as in ground truth) has tasks in rows and roles in columns with cells as R/A/C/I letters. LLM flips this by listing tasks in rows but placing full role names in cells under R/A/C/I columns, creating nonsensical assignments (e.g., multiple roles per cell like "Transaction Analyst/Workload Logging System").
- **Incomplete/inaccurate mapping of source text**: Splits steps oddly into 8 rows (e.g., separates logging and screening, treats notification as a separate "task"); omits or distorts coverage (e.g., no clear handling of SWIFT sending integrated with release; ignores high-risk flagging logic). Ground truth concisely maps all 6 steps without extras or omissions.
- **Structural errors**: Adds irrelevant header ("Cross-border payment handling..."); 8 rows vs. ground truth's 6; no legend; tasks phrased with informal/source language instead of mandated/clean wording (e.g., "Payment clerk receives..." vs. "Receive Payment Instruction").
- **Overall fidelity**: Near-total deviation from ground truth's clean, compliant structure, using only mandated terms and precise step coverage. Even minor issues (e.g., bolding inconsistencies in ground truth) would deduct, but this is a complete rewrite violating the core task.
