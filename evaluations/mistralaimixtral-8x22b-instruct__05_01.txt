The LLM answer proposes a fundamentally different solution: attaches the timer to `Task_Triage` (wrong element vs. ground truth's `Task_Receive`), targets a new/optional end event `End_Escalate` (wrong target vs. `Task_Triage`), omits "interrupting" specification and XML `<bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>`, fails to mention bypassing doc requests, introduces unnecessary new end event, and misaligns with SLA (monitors Triage duration vs. time to reach Triage). No reuse of `Task_Triage` as escalation target. Excessive differences warrant minimum score.
