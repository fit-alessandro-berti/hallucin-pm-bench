The LLM answer is semantically identical and equally concise/correct, capturing the core reason (missing timestamps for start-completion duration). Minor deductions for: (1) omitting explicit reference to “Dual Authorization” (ground truth includes it), (2) not mentioning “event counts” or “duration information” explicitly, and (3) slight phrasing variance (“cannot be determined” vs. “impossible to compute”; “duration between...events” vs. “start-to-completion intervals absent”). Under utmost strictness, these small omissions/differences warrant a 0.8-point loss from a perfect 10.0.
