The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) and quotes the exact average and 95th-percentile waiting times from the table, with no mention of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities. The memo format is crisp and under 150 words, adhering to the structure.

However, under strict evaluation, the recommendations fall short: they are concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues but lack explicit data-driven elements (e.g., no references to pilots, estimates, or metrics) and do not quantify the promised ≥20% reduction, as required by the prompt and exemplified in the ground truth (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%", "estimated 30%"). The more formal memo headers add unnecessary length compared to the ground truth's concise bullets, slightly diluting crispness. These omissions warrant a deduction despite high overall alignment.
