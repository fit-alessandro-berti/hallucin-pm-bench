4.0

### Evaluation Summary (strict rubric application)
**Score: 4.0/10.0** (moderate-low due to structural, naming, and format differences from ground truth; small errors like casing/attributes compound to significant deductions per instructions).

**Key Matches (supporting partial credit):**
- Correct overall process topology: validation loop with exclusive GW, warranty exclusive GW, parallel split/join for shipments/pickup, sequential update/close after join.
- Exactly the required gateways (2 exclusive, parallel split/join pair).
- Exactly 2 end events (rejection vs. success).
- All IDs prefixed "wrc_" (flows, tasks, etc.).
- Valid self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML (parsable, no syntax errors).
- Core sequence flows connect semantically similar paths.

**Key Differences/Deductions (strict, significant loss for each):**
- **Structural/Element Mismatches (major deductions, ~-3.0 points)**:
  - LLM omits required "Send rejection notice" task (explicit in prompt step 3; present in GT as `wrc_reject` → direct flow to end_reject).
  - LLM adds hallucinated/extra "check warranty eligibility" task (`wrc_checkWarrantyEligibility`) between completeness GW and warranty GW (absent in GT, where warranty GW follows directly from completeness "Yes"; -1.0 for extra task vs rubric).
  - Different flow topology: GT has reject path `warranty_gw → reject task → end`; LLM has `warranty_gw → end` (shorter reject path).
- **Task Names Not Verbatim/Matching GT (~-1.5 points)**:
  - Casing inconsistent (LLM mostly lowercase e.g., "validate the claim", "request missing information"; GT title-case e.g., "Validate the Claim").
  - Parallel tasks longer/mismatched: LLM "create shipment order for the replacement unit" / "schedule courier pickup of the faulty product" vs GT shortened "Create shipment order" / "Schedule courier pickup".
  - Verb forms off vs prompt text (e.g., "validate" vs "validates"; strict verbatim required).
- **Format/Output Violations (~-0.5 points)**:
  - Extra prose after XML ("This XML specifies..."); prompt requires "single self-contained BPMN 2.0 XML document" (GT is pure XML).
- **Minor but Cumulative Errors (per strictness, ~-1.0 points)**:
  - Extra namespaces (xsi, bpmndi, dc, di unused); GT minimal (bpmn only).
  - Extra attributes (e.g., `gatewayDirection`; GT omits).
  - Process diffs: ID "wrc_WarrantyReplacementProcess" vs "wrc_process"; `isExecutable="true"` vs "false".
  - Missing GT names on events/GWs (e.g., start "Online warranty claim submitted", GWs "Claim complete?", "Within warranty?").
  - Flow names differ (LLM "Incomplete"/"Complete"; GT "No"/"Yes").
  - Element order/definition style (LLM mixes inline flows; GT grouped with comments at end).
  - Longer/more verbose (GT "minimal-yet-complete 34 lines").

Semantically ~80% equivalent (same logic/flow control), but XML/graph not identical due to task swap/omission → not full credit. No criminal content issues.
