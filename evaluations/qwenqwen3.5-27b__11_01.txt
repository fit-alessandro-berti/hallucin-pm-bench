### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities/numbers)**: Perfect match. Top 3 by avg waiting time correctly ranked (#1 Request_Documents 36.5/120.0h, #2 Send_Closure_Letter 12.2/44.0h, #3 Assess_Liability 7.8/16.4h). Numbers quoted verbatim (with "h" from table headers).
- **No unwarranted content**: Mostly clean—no service-time figures, no other activities, no throughput metrics. Minor deduction for closing sentence implying "service capacity" (touches forbidden "service-time" topic) and "claim lifecycle velocity" (evokes "throughput").
- **Action relevance**: Logical, concrete, tied to waiting issues (e.g., automation for docs/mail, rules for assessment). Promises ≥20% cut. However, differs significantly from ground truth actions (no matching wording/specifics like pilots/escalations/e-signatures); lacks "data-driven" flavor (e.g., no invented pilots/estimates as in GT).
- **Format/structure**: Proper memo header/SUBJECT exceeds GT's bare list, better fits "executive memo." Crisp (68 words <150). Strict deduction for action divergence and subtle topic slips (-0.5 each); high similarity otherwise justifies 9+.
- **Strictness applied**: -0.8 total for differences (actions/format nuances, minor infractions).
