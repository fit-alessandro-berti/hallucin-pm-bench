10.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth precisely across all questions: exact frequency (1), percentage (5.56%), case identifier (A1002), and two valid, clearly stated sampling-related reasons (small sample size/short window aligning with "small sample size" and "temporal bias"; selection/non-random sampling aligning with "case-mix bias"). No hallucinations, inferences beyond the log, or errors in content, calculation, or reasoning. Minor formatting differences (e.g., bolding, escapes) do not impact accuracy.
