**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer is **semantically equivalent** in core structure and flow (correct loop for incompleteness, warranty XOR gateway, parallel split/join, exact 7 tasks + 4 gateways + 1 start + 2 ends + 15 sequence flows, no extra/omitted/hallucinated flow elements), matching the prompt's required gateways and modeling only explicit elements. IDs correctly prefixed with "wrc_". This warrants a baseline >5.0.

However, **strict deductions** for differences vs. ground truth and prompt violations (small errors cause significant loss):

- **Task name verbatim violations** (-1.2): Prompt requires **verbatim** match to bolded text. LLM uses infinitive/lowercase ("validate the claim", "request missing information") vs. prompt's 3rd-person ("**validates the claim**", "**requests missing information**"). Ground truth alters to capitalized infinitive but closer convention-wise. Other tasks mostly match casing/verbatim except minor casing diffs (e.g., "update inventory records" vs. ground "Update...").
- **Start event name** (-0.4): "Start" ignores prompt's "**online warranty claim**" trigger; ground truth interpretive but descriptive ("Online warranty claim submitted").
- **Invented conditionExpressions** (-0.6): 4 sequence flows add unmentioned `<conditionExpression>` with hallucinated variables (e.g., `${incomplete}`), violating "model **only** explicitly mentioned" and "do **not** invent... beyond stated." Ground truth uses flow `name="Yes"/"No"` (standard label alternative, no invention).
- **Extra/hallucinated attributes & bloat** (-0.3): Unnecessary xmlns (activiti, bpmndi/dc/di – engine/diagram-specific), `schemaLocation`, process `name`, gateway/end names/labels differing from ground truth. ~70 lines vs. ground truth's minimal 34.
- **Namespace/style diffs** (-0.2): Default ns (valid) vs. ground truth's explicit `bpmn:` prefix; minor parsing equivalence but not identical.
- **Minor label diffs** (-0.1): Gateways/ends/flow names vary (e.g., "Completeness Check" vs. "Claim complete?", no names on parallels).

Total: High fidelity to logic/flow (9+/10 merit) offset by ~2.8 points in strict verbatim/ minimalism/invention penalties. Not 10.0 (not identical/minimal), not <5.0 (no structural errors).
