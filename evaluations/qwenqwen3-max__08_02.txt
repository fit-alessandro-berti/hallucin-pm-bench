The LLM answer is fundamentally inconsistent and erroneous in structure: it initially states "No" for Q1, violating the ground truth "Yes," then rambles in a convoluted >200-word explanation (exceeding the 120-word limit) before self-correcting to "Yes." The sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] matches the ground truth but lacks markings (M₁ to M₅), precise enabling conditions, and the key detail that T5 disables T3 afterward. This half-correct, messy output shows poor adherence to clarity, brevity, and accuracy, warranting substantial deduction despite capturing the core possibility.
