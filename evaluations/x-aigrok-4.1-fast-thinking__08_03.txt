The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is possible ("Yes"), provides the correct minimal prefix sequence `T1 T2b T4 T5` to reach a state where T5 fires without T3 having fired (demonstrating no prior T3), and includes a brief correct note on why T3 couldn't fire (no pc token). This proves T5 can fire before T3 under a reasonable interpretation of the question.

However, with utmost strictness against the ground truth:
- Major difference: Sequence is incomplete/shorter (4 vs. 6 transitions); omits T6 T3, which GT uses to explicitly show T3 firing *after* T5 via feedback, arguably better proving the full "before" ordering when both fire.
- No step-by-step markings with token flows.
- Lacks detailed "Why this works" explanation (shortcut, feedback role).
- No formal proof of minimality or lower bound argument.
- Brief format vs. GT's structured, comprehensive response.

These are significant differences in completeness, detail, and exact sequence, warranting deduction despite core correctness (no factual errors). Equivalent to ~70% match.
