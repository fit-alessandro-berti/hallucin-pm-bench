4.5

**Evaluation:**

**R1:** LLM says Violated; ground truth says Compliant. The LLM incorrectly assumes a new Manager_Approval is required post-Change_Request; the rule only requires the Manager-then-Finance approval sequence for PO > â‚¬10,000, which was satisfied before the Change_Request. This is a **major error**.

**R2:** LLM says Compliant; ground truth says Violated. The LLM incorrectly counts the required approval as the ones before the Change_Request, not after the post-change Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07. In fact, Ship_Goods happened before the proper approval, which violates the expedited rule. **Major error**.

**R3:** LLM answer is correct; both indicate Violated with correct reasoning.

**R4:** LLM answer is correct; both indicate Not Applicable with correct reasoning.

**R5:** Both say Violated, but LLM justification is less precise than ground truth, although mainly correct. Minor deduction.

**R6:** Both say Compliant.

**Overall result:** Both say NON-COMPLIANT.

**Summary:** The answer replicates the structure but makes two severe reasoning mistakes affecting R1 and R2 (flipped their compliance status relative to reality). R5 justification is less specific. Correct overall result, structure, and some correct rules.

**Deductions:**
- Major error R1 (-2)
- Major error R2 (-2)
- Less precise justification R5 (-0.3)
- Correct formatting and result (+0.8)

**Strict scoring:** 4.5
