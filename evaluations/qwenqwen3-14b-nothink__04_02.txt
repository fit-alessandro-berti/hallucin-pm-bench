3.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Format Adherence (2/10)**: Follows the required structure (status + ≤20-word justification per rule, all-caps overall result), but uses bolding inconsistent with prompt's plain text expectation; ground truth uses a table, but this is minor.
- **R1 Accuracy (0/10)**: Major error—status "Violated" is incorrect (should be "Compliant"); justification wrongly links to post-change approval, which R1 does not require. Misinterprets rule scope.
- **R2 Accuracy (0/10)**: Major error—status "Compliant" is incorrect (should be "Violated"); justification uses wrong reference date (pre-change approval on 03-04 instead of post-change final approval on 07-03). Fails to account for R5's impact on "last required approval," leading to incorrect timing assessment (Ship_Goods precedes the new approval, violating the "after" clause implicitly).
- **R3 Accuracy (9/10)**: Status correct ("Violated"); justification accurate and concise, matching ground truth dates and sequencing.
- **R4 Accuracy (8/10)**: Status correct ("Not Applicable"); justification similar to ground truth, but slightly wordier and less precise (omits "trace has" detail).
- **R5 Accuracy (6/10)**: Status correct ("Violated"); justification captures essence but is vaguer than ground truth (lacks specifics on "Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before new Manager_Approval," missing key examples of "further processing").
- **R6 Accuracy (10/10)**: Status and justification both correct, directly matching ground truth.
- **Overall Result (10/10)**: Correctly "NON-COMPLIANT," though ground truth notes specific violations (R2, R3, R5), which LLM implicitly mismatches by flagging wrong rules.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Two critical rule status errors (R1, R2) fundamentally alter compliance analysis, each warranting full deduction; minor justification variances deduct further. Total reflects ~50% accuracy on core rule assessments, penalized heavily per instructions.
