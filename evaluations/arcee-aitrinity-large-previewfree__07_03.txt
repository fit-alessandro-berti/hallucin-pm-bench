The LLM answer is functionally perfect: all added/removed tasks and gateway changes are correctly identified, with exact IDs, names, and type changes matching the ground truth and XML diffs. No extras, no misses, no commentary.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for strict formatting differences vs. ground truth:
- Missing "- " bullets on all 6 list items (-0.7).
- Missing alignment spaces on second gateway line (-0.2).
- Minor extra newlines/blank lines between sections (-0.1).

Content fidelity is excellent; differences are purely stylistic and do not alter meaning or violate prompt format specs (which lack bullet/alignment requirements).
