4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of scored response):
- **Major error (significant deduction)**: The LLM completely missed the removal of `Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)`, leaving the "REMOVED TASKS" section empty. This violates the requirement to summarize *all* functional changes, as this task is present in v1 but absent in v2. This alone warrants a large point loss under strict criteria, as it represents incomplete analysis of verifiable differences.
- **Partial correctness**:
  - "ADDED TASKS": Correctly identifies all three added tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval, Task_NotifyCustomer) with proper `id` (name) format. However, lacks the bullet points/dashes used in ground truth (- Task_FraudCheck...), which introduces a formatting difference.
  - "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES": Correctly identifies both changes (Gateway_ReviewNeeded and Gateway_Payment) with the exact «old type → new type» phrasing. Lacks bullet points/dashes and the alignment spaces in the second item (e.g., "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel" vs. LLM's "Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel"), counting as minor formatting discrepancies.
- **Overall structure**: Follows the three verbatim headings in order and avoids commentary/unchanged elements, which is good. No extra content.
- **Strictness applied**: The missing removed task is a substantive content error (not small), leading to ~50% incompleteness in functional changes. Formatting differences (absence of - bullets and minor spacing) are small but deduct further per instructions. Total: Starts at 10, deduct 4.0 for missing change, 1.5 for formatting inconsistencies, 0.5 for empty section implying oversight.
