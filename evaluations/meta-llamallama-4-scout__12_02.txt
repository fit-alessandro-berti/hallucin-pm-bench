The LLM answer correctly identifies that the stated fact is not accurate and provides a valid counterexample by citing case C003 with correct references to line numbers. However, it omits a crucial detail found in the ground truth: the occurrence in case C005, where *Validate_Payment* takes place without any *Receive_Order* event at all. This omission is significant, as it fails to highlight another kind of counterexample (absence of *Receive_Order* for a *Validate_Payment* event). The phrasing and supporting explanation are otherwise clear and appropriate, but the lack of the C005 example results in a notable deduction.
