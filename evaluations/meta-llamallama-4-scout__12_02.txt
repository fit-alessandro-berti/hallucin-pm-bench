The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as "No" and provides a valid counterexample from case C003 (lines 6-7), which alone suffices to falsify the "always follows" claim. The justification is concise, cites specific lines and cases, and aligns with the prompt's format (Yes/No followed by one paragraph). However, it deducts points for a clear error: it incorrectly states that case C005 "follows the order," when C005 has Validate_Payment (line 11) without any preceding Receive_Order, representing an additional counterexample omitted from the explanation. This factual inaccuracy and incompleteness in covering all key violations (as highlighted in the ground truth) warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
