**Evaluation rationale:**  
- **Mandated vocabulary**: The LLM answer uses the mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"), and does not introduce disallowed synonyms. Good.
- **Structure and clarity**: The markdown RACI matrix is clear.
- **Faithfulness to the process**: 
  - **Roles**: The LLM answer omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely, while the ground truth includes it and assigns "Accountable" for every task to that role, which is critical for proper RACI documentation. This is a *major* omission.
  - **Tasks mapping**: The LLM answer splits some steps (e.g., 5a and 5b for payment release and SWIFT messaging), which is acceptable, but does not exactly match the ground truth activity names or their grouping.  
  - **RACI assignments**: 
    - The LLM answer often merges "Responsible" and "Accountable" into "**R / A**" for the same role. In strict RACI, "Accountable" should always be a single role, distinct from the "Responsible" if possible. The ground truth assigns "Accountable" to the Operations Manager, never to the executor.
    - In the "KYC Review" row, the LLM answer makes the "Regulatory Liaison" both Responsible and Accountable (ground truth correctly assigns Responsible to Reg. Liaison, but Accountable to Ops Manager, with Consulted and Informed per requirements).
    - Throughout, the LLM misassigns many C/I roles compared to ground truth, and sometimes drops them.
- **Completeness**: The LLM's matrix does not include the Operations Manager, omits some Consulted/Informed roles, and combines or splits tasks in ways not instructed.
- **Strictness of evaluation**: Significant point loss for missing a role (Operations Manager), misassigning Accountabilities, and not matching consult/inform assignments. Even small errors warrant strong penalties as per instructions.

**Conclusion**:  
The LLM answer is readable, uses the correct terms, and captures the general process, but the omission of Operations Manager and significant RACI misassignments are substantial deviations, resulting in a major point deduction.
