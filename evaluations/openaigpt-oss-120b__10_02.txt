4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt's requirements but exhibits substantial deviations from the ground truth, warranting a low-to-moderate score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Role Columns (Major Deviation, -3.0 points)**: The LLM omits "Operations Manager," a core column in the ground truth that holds primary accountability (A) across all tasks. This results in incomplete RACI coverage, with the LLM incorrectly combining R/A in single roles (e.g., Transaction Analyst or Regulatory Liaison) instead of distributing accountability to Operations Manager. IT Support is included correctly, but the missing role fundamentally alters the matrix's structure and intent.

- **Task Breakdown and Naming (Medium Deviation, -1.5 points)**: The LLM accurately covers all steps from the informal description but unnecessarily splits step 5 into "5a" (Release) and "5b" (SWIFT), introducing extra granularity not present in the ground truth's consolidated "Release Payment." Task names are mostly descriptive but differ in wording (e.g., "Receive customerâ€™s transfer instruction and log it in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Archive the case file" vs. "Archive Record"), showing minor inconsistencies. "KYC Review" is used correctly in both, with no disallowed terms.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deviation, -2.0 points)**: Assignments mismatch the ground truth in nearly every cell due to the missing Operations Manager:
  - Task 1 (Receive): LLM assigns R/A to Analyst (incorrect; ground truth has A to Operations Manager, C to IT Support); IT Support blank vs. C.
  - Task 2 (Screen): R/A to Analyst vs. R to Analyst, A to Regulatory Liaison; IT Support blank vs. C, Operations Manager I.
  - Task 3 (KYC): Close (R to Liaison), but LLM adds A to Liaison and I to Analyst vs. ground truth's A to Operations Manager, C to Analyst, I to IT Support.
  - Task 4 (Approve): C to Analyst matches, but R/A to Liaison vs. R to Liaison, A to Operations Manager; IT Support blank vs. I.
  - Task 5 (Release/SWIFT): Split structure mismatches; e.g., R/A to Analyst and C to Liaison for release vs. R to Analyst, A to Operations Manager, C to IT Support; SWIFT handling differs significantly.
  - Task 6 (Archive): I to Analyst and I (notify) to Liaison vs. C to Analyst, I to Liaison; R/A to IT Support matches R to IT Support, but A to Operations Manager missing.
  These shifts violate RACI principles (e.g., single A per task) as interpreted in the ground truth.

- **Formatting and Additional Elements (Minor Strengths, +1.0 point)**: Markdown table is used correctly, with a clear # column (helpful but not in ground truth). The legend/key is similar and comprehensive. Vocabulary mandate is followed strictly (KYC Review, Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison; no CDD, Compliance Officer, etc.). No omissions of source text steps, and a title is provided (ground truth lacks one).

Overall, while the LLM captures the mandated vocabulary and all process steps without criminal or off-topic issues, the structural omissions, mismatched assignments, and altered granularity create high divergence from the ground truth, reflecting poor fidelity. No partial credit for "creative" additions like splitting tasks, as they introduce differences.
