7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Strengths**: Correct status for R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6. Overall conclusion matches (NON-COMPLIANT). Justifications are concise (≤20 words) and mostly aligned.
- **Errors**: 
  - R2 status incorrect (Compliant vs. Violated); justification ignores change request's impact on "last required approval" (new Manager_Approval on 03-07), causing Ship_Goods (03-05) to precede rather than follow within 2 days—major compliance misinterpretation.
  - R5 justification incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice as a further processing step before new approval).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: One critical rule violation (R2) and minor incompleteness deduct ~3 points from a potential 10; 5/6 rules fully accurate supports 7.0 baseline.
