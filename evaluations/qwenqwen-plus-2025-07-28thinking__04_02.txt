6.0

Rationale:  
- R1: Correct (Compliant) and justification aligns with ground truth.
- R2: Incorrect. The LLM answer states "Compliant" and only checks interval from Finance_Approval to Ship_Goods. Ground truth correctly identifies that a new Manager_Approval is required after the Change_Request, so Ship_Goods is too early, making this rule "Violated."
- R3: Correct (Violated) with accurate justification.
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable), justification fine.
- R5: Correct (Violated), justification nearly matches, mentioning Ship_Goods before new Manager_Approval (ground truth also notes Pay_Invoice, which LLM omits).
- R6: Correct (Compliant).
- Overall, the LLM answer misses the most subtle and critical issue in R2, which changes the overall assessment of that rule and could mislead an auditor. This is a serious error for compliance auditing, meriting a significant point deduction. Some small omissions (not referencing both events in R5) also warrant downgrade.

Thus, the answer loses significant points for the major R2 error, smaller errors/omissions elsewhere, and does not reach the level of strictness and accuracy required for a high-stakes audit context.
