**3.0**

The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling/capitalization and avoids forbidden terms entirely (+ full credit here). Activity rows and role columns match exactly, with no extra tasks/roles/columns. It maintains one primary Responsible/Accountable (R/A) per row, aligning with one Responsible rule.

However, under utmost strictness, there are extensive differences from ground truth:
- **RACI cell mismatches (semantic)**: 16/24 cells differ (e.g., missing C/I across most rows; AM I vs. A or C; CO R/A vs. R; FC R/A vs. R; unnecessary – where GT has C/I; IT – vs. I). Only 8 cells match semantically.
- **R/A handling**: LLM combines R/A on performers only; GT separates (e.g., AM A + CO/FC R for KYC/Payment Clearance; no extra A on non-AM primaries).
- **AM Accountability**: LLM fails where GT assigns A to AM for non-primary activities (KYC Review, Payment Clearance).
- **Formatting/extras**: No bolding on primaries (**R / A**, **R**); R/A lacks spaces ("R/A" vs. "R / A"); adds unwarranted title ("### FinCo Order-to-Cash RACI Matrix") and legend (GT has neither).
- Cumulative small errors (cell precision, extras) cause major deductions per instructions.

~33% cell similarity justifies 3.0; more differences would drop further.
