8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks in the precise order, with no factual errors, omissions, or extraneous references to other processes. It accurately reflects the parallel constructs from Process B. However, under utmost strictness:

- Differences in formatting and notation: `{Quality_Check, Update_Inventory}` with comma vs. `` `Quality_Check` ‖ `Update_Inventory` ``; "Parallel Split #1" vs. "first parallel block".
- Extra introductory sentence and explanatory phrases ("These tasks execute concurrently following Parallel Split #1"), not present in ground truth.
- Missing closing statement ("No other tasks..."), though not strictly required by prompt.
- Minor wording variances (e.g., "concurrently executable task sets (based on parallel constructs)" vs. direct "Set 1 – first parallel block").

These stylistic/presentation differences, while semantically equivalent, warrant a deduction from a perfect score.
