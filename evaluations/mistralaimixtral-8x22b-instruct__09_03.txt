The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in identifying the impossibility due to redacted data in Artefact A (no timestamps or rows for "Approve Invoice"), correctly avoiding any computation or guessing, and precisely explaining the lack of necessary concrete times for cycle time, std dev, and CI. Minor deductions for: (1) not strictly "one short paragraph" (uses numbered list and extra sentences), (2) unnecessary elaboration on Artefact B (accurate but absent in ground truth), (3) slight verbosity/wording differences (e.g., "redacted" vs. "removed"; lists "case IDs" explicitly; "granular data" vs. direct focus on timestamps). These are small format/content deviations under utmost strictness.
