5.5

The answer closely matches on Q1, Q2, and Q3, but contains notable errors in Q4 and Q5:

- Q1: Correct. (3)  
- Q2: Correct. ("Pack_Items")  
- Q3: Correct. ("2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00")  
- Q4: Incorrect. The answer reports 3, but there are only 2 "Quality_Check" events in the log.  
- Q5: Incorrect. The answer lists all activities, including ones that did appear as the first event in a case (e.g., "Receive_Order" and "Quality_Check"), and also includes "Quality_Check" which did start a caseâ€”whereas the ground truth excludes it.

Each mistake on Q4 and Q5 is significant. Q4 is a factual counting error; Q5 demonstrates a misunderstanding of case starts. Since three out of five fields are perfect, but the remaining two have clear logical errors, the score is penalized accordingly, landing at 5.5.
