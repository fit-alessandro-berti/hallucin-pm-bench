The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly on Q1, Q2, and Q3 (perfect accuracy on these). However, Q4 is incorrect (3 instead of 2, miscounting "Quality_Check" occurrencesâ€”there are only two instances in the log for B-1045 and C-77). Q5 is substantially wrong, listing all five activities (including the two that do appear as first events: "Receive_Order" and "Quality_Check"), rather than only the three that never start a case. These two errors represent major factual deviations, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria.
