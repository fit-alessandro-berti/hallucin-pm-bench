3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict, point-by-point):
- **Headings (minor format issues, -0.5)**: Used colons (e.g., "ADDED TASKS:"), no bullets/dashes; ground truth uses plain headings with bullets under. Order correct.
- **ADDED TASKS (major errors, -4.0)**: Missed 2/3 tasks (Task_FraudCheck, Task_FastTrackApproval). Only partial credit for Task_NotifyCustomer (no parentheses/name). No bullets.
- **REMOVED TASKS (complete error, -2.0)**: Incorrectly states "None"; missed Task_ManualReview (Manual Review).
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES (major errors, -0.5)**: Missed Gateway_Payment change entirely. Partial for Gateway_ReviewNeeded but wrong format (no "exclusive → parallel", says "→ ParallelGateway"; no colon after ID). Empty line unnecessary.
- **Overall structure/compliance (-0.0)**: Contains only three headings, no extra commentary—partial adherence.
- **Total deductions**: From 10.0, resulting in 3.0 for ~30% accuracy on verifiable differences (1/3 added partial, 0/1 removed, 1/2 gateways partial). Strict penalty for omissions and format violations per instructions.
