**8.0**

The LLM answer is correct on the core conclusion (yes, possible via T2b shortcut), provides accurate step-by-step analysis with markings, identifies the key bypass of pc correctly, and gives a valid *prefix* of the ground truth sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) as the shortest to enable/fire T5 without T3. No factual errors or assumptions beyond the net.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Major difference**: Firing sequence is incomplete (4 steps vs. ground truth's 6-step sequence explicitly demonstrating T5 *before* T3 with both firing, using T6 feedback). LLM stops at T5 ("T3 has not yet fired"), missing the full ordering proof including T3 after, which ground truth emphasizes as part of "achieves this order" and proves minimal (lower bound + extras).
- **Medium differences**: No proof of shortness (lacks ground truth's lower bound argument or "no shorter exists"); doesn't use/explain feedback loop (T6→T3) despite mentioning T6; less structured format (prose analysis vs. numbered list with per-step markings/descriptions in code block); no "Why this works" details on post-T5 re-enabling.
- These are significant deviations from ground truth content/structure, costing points despite strong overlap (~80% match on key logic/path). Perfect match would be 10.0.
