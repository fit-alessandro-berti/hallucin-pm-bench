**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core idea partially correct (+1.5)**: Recognizes need for 48h timer post-receive to force toward Triage, reusing existing elements (GW_Docs, Task_Triage), no new tasks.
- **Major BPMN errors (-4.0)**: 
  - Wrong attachment: "Timer on Start_Claim (start event)" invalid; start events lack boundary timers (must be on activity like Task_Receive).
  - Vague/undefined type: No "interrupting boundary timer"; non-interrupting wouldn't bypass/escalate.
  - Wrong target/flow: To GW_Docs (pre-Triage, docs status unset post-timeout → potential re-loop, violates SLA guarantee) vs. direct to Task_Triage.
  - No XML specifics (e.g., id="Timer_48h", PT48H duration).
- **Minor issues (-1.8)**: Confuses Start_Claim ("Claim Submitted") with Task_Receive; imprecise escalation ("forces early triage"); >80 words but rambling vs. ground truth precision.
- Strict penalty for technical inaccuracies preventing SLA compliance in valid BPMN.
