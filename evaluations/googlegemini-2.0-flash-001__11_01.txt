7.0

- **Correct activities and order:** The memo correctly identifies and ranks the top three waiting-time activities and gives their average and 95th percentile waiting times. The numbers are quoted precisely from the table.
- **No extraneous metrics:** It does not introduce service time, throughput, or other activities.
- **Action relevance:** Each activity is paired with a plausible, data-driven action to reduce waiting time.

**Deductions for errors:**
- **Verbatim requirement:** The answer slightly paraphrases the waiting time metrics instead of quoting them verbatim (e.g., "Average wait: X hours; 95th percentile: Y hours" vs "avg X h, p95 Y h").
- **Action specificity:** The actions are reasonable, but less specific/targeted than the ground truth. For instance:
    - For Request_Documents, the suggested action ("automated document requests with pre-populated forms") is broader and not as data-backed as "automated customer reminders with 24h escalation triggers; pilot tests show...".
    - For Send_Closure_Letter, it suggests "automatic triggers upon payment approval or claim rejection" instead of the more concrete "same-day e-signature letters on claim closure".
    - For Assess_Liability, "expert system to auto-classify" is less explicit than "rules-engine pre-classification so simple cases bypass queue".
- **Memo format:** The memo includes formalities (TO/FROM/DATE/SUBJECT) that use valuable word-space, risking the 150-word limit. The ground truth is more concise.
- **Redundancy/wordiness:** "Eliminating manual scheduling and potentially dropping wait timesâ€¦" is non-concise; the ground truth gives direct, quantified claims.

**Overall:** The answer is accurate in activity identification and numbers, free of nonspecified data, and proposes relevant actions. However, it lacks verbatim numerical presentation, uses less specific actions, and is wordier and less focused than the gold standard. Significant but not catastrophic point deductions are warranted.
