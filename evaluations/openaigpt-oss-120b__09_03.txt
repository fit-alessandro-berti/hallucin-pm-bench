The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and precision, correctly identifying the impossibility due to the absence of event rows and timestamps in Artefact A, while adhering to the one-short-paragraph format and avoiding any guessing. The minor phrasing differences (e.g., explicit mention of the activity name and metrics vs. a more generalized "dispersion") do not introduce errors but slightly diverge from the ground truth's concise "Impossible" opener, warranting a small deduction for not matching verbatim.
