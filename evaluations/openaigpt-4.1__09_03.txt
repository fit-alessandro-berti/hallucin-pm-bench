9.0

The LLM answer correctly states that it is not possible to compute the requested metrics due to the absence of data, and it accurately identifies that the lack of event rows and timestamps is the reason. The explanation is clear and concise, and does not speculate or introduce outside knowledge, fully aligning with the requirements.

However, compared to the ground truth answer, there are minor shortcomings:
- The ground truth uses clear, explicit language (“Impossible — the necessary data are absent”) and specifies the precise columns and calculation terms (“start_time / complete_time”, “concrete times for any ‘Approve Invoice’ execution”), whereas the LLM answer is slightly more generic (“Without concrete start and complete times...”).
- The LLM answer repeats the impossibility in a somewhat wordier fashion, while the ground truth is more direct and succinct.
- The LLM answer could be seen as lacking the phrase that “Additional raw log entries are required,” which helps close the loop on what would enable the calculation.

These are minor points, but per the instructions, even small errors should incur significant deduction. Thus, a 1-point reduction: 9.0.
