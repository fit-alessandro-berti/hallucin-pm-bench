The LLM answer is essentially identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and precision: both correctly identify the impossibility due to redacted data (headers only, no rows or timestamps), explicitly reference the inability to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval, and provide a concise, non-guessing explanation in one short paragraph without tables or extraneous details. No differences or errors are present.
