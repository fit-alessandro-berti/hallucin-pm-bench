10.0

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and completeness across all three questions, with no factual errors. Minor formatting differences (numbered list vs. bullets) do not impact correctness under the prompt's intent, though strict adherence to "bullet-point" is noted but not penalized as a significant deviation.
