9.8

- The LLM answer is correct in content for all three questions.
- However, the phrasing slightly deviates from the bullet-point style requested and expected by the ground truth (minor use of full sentences instead of strictly concise bullet points; for example, stating "There are 3 distinct cases: ..." instead of simply listing "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)").
- The answers themselves (case count, immediate predecessor, and unique activity) are all factually correct and match the ground truth.
- Deducting 0.2 points for less-than-optimal adherence to the strict bullet-point style.
