8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the ground truth content and XML facts. No speculation or extra elements are included, and all required headings are used exactly as specified in the prompt.

However, under strict evaluation:
- **Format inconsistencies** (significant deduction: -1.5 points): The LLM uses full XML tags (e.g., `<task id="check_vip" name="..."/>`) for added/removed tasks, while the ground truth uses a concise natural-language format (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Bullets differ (â€¢ vs. *), headings lack bolding (**), and the gateway description omits version indicators ((v1)/(v2)) and backticks/formatting for the ID and tag names.
- **Minor omissions** (smaller deduction: -0.5 points): No final note like the ground truth's "(No other differences should be reported.)", though not strictly required by the prompt.

These are small but noticeable presentation errors, leading to a high but not perfect score. Core accuracy is excellent.
