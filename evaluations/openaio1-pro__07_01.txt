9.0

The LLM answer contains all of the correct differences matching the ground truth, uses exact element names from the XML, and groups under the required headings. However, the LLM's answer lists the raw XML line for the added and removed tasks instead of following the ground truth's format of providing the task name and id in the specified style. The gateway type change is also presented in a more raw format instead of the ground truth's wording.

These formatting/style discrepancies, though minor, should result in the deduction of a full point to reflect the requirement for the utmost strictness. All factual differences are correct, but formatting is not strictly followed per the ground truth.

Strict breakdown:
- Factual accuracy: 10/10
- Formatting strictness (required by instructions): -1

Final score: 9.0
