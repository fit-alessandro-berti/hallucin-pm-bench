The LLM answer fails catastrophically: malformed/invalid unified diff (duplicated lines, incorrect hunk, non-matching original XML structure); illegal process-breaking change (reversing Flow_5 orphans tasks, creates no parallelism, violates flow integrity without gateway adjustments forbidden by rules); fabricated/wrong rationale (no 30% improvement, no parallelism achieved); extraneous XML snippet outside format; completely diverges from ground truth's valid attribute modification.
