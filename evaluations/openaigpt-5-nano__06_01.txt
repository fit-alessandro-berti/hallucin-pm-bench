9.0

The LLM answer lists the correct pairs, with the correct task names, and orders them both within each pair and as a sorted output, matching the required formatting except for one small error: the pair "Procure_Materials  â€”  Schedule_Machines" does not align the dashes with the ground truth, which uses two spaces before and after the em dash. The LLM answer used only one space on either side.

While the content is fully correct, the strict instructions require **significant loss of points for even small formatting errors**. This minor formatting miss results in a deduction of 1 point, yielding a score of 9.0.
