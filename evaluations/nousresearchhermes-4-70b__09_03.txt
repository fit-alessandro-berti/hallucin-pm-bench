The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of computation due to the complete absence of event data (rows and timestamps) in Artefact A, with no relevant timing information in Artefact B, and explains this precisely in one short paragraph without guessing or using external knowledge. It fully aligns with the ground truth in reasoning, structure, and adherence to instructions, with only negligible phrasing differences (e.g., slight verbosity and non-specific mention of "cycle times" vs. explicit activity reference) that do not impact accuracy or completeness.
