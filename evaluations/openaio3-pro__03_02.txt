The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, format, element IDs, some names, condition expressions, and crucially in the flow modeling of the parallel branches (join position for logging is after close in LLM vs. after sendResponse in ground truth, altering the process logic). The JSON schema is entirely different (detailed BPMN-like definitions vs. simple elements/flows arrays), making it not a close match despite covering core elements without hallucinations. Strict evaluation penalizes these as major discrepancies in representation and semantics.
