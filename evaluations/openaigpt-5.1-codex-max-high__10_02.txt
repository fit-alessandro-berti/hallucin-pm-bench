**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Columns/Roles (major deduction: -4.0)**: LLM uses only 3 columns (TA, RL, IT) with abbreviations; ground truth has 4 (TA, RL, Operations Manager, IT Support) without abbreviations. Missing "Operations Manager" is a critical omission/substitution violation.
- **Rows/Tasks (major deduction: -2.0)**: 8 rows vs. 6 in ground truth. LLM adds unsubstantiated splits ("Ensure SWIFT...", "Notify Regulatory Liaison...") and verbose phrasing (e.g., "Conduct KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs. exact "**KYC Review**"). Omits mandated short/precise wording like "Receive Payment Instruction", "Archive Record".
- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -1.5)**: Mismatches in nearly every cell (e.g., KYC: TA C/RL R-A/IT I vs. TA C/RL **R**/Ops **A**/IT I; Approve: TA I vs. C; combined "R / A" invalid vs. single bold values). No consistent **bold** formatting for R/A.
- **Vocabulary/Format (minor but strict deduction: -0.5)**: Correctly uses "KYC Review", "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", but task headers lack "(mandated wording)" note and bolding. Legend phrasing/position minor diff.
- **Overall Fidelity**: Covers source but deviates heavily from ground truth structure, mappings, and precision. No perfect cells; ~20% partial similarity at best. Strict policy penalizes all diffs proportionally.
