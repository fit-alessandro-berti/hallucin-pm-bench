The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes the exact average and 95th-percentile waiting times from the table, and avoids any discussion of service times, throughput, or other activities. Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues, and each explicitly promises a â‰¥20% reduction without fabricating unsupported data, fulfilling the "data-driven" requirement through process-logic relevance.

Minor deductions for differences from ground truth: slightly more verbose memo format (headers, closing sentence on efficiency/satisfaction, which adds interpretive fluff not in ground truth); action phrasings differ in specificity (e.g., no simulated "pilot tests" or exact % estimates like 25-30%, but still compliant); and minor stylistic variations (e.g., "decrement" vs. "decrease"). These are small but warrant a strict 0.8-point loss for not matching the ground truth's ultra-concise, bullet-like structure precisely. Overall, high fidelity to prompt and table.
