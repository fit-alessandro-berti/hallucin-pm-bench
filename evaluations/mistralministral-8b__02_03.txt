4.5

- The LLM correctly answered Question 1 and 2. It correctly identified that there are 3 distinct cases and that, for C456, the activity immediately before "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items".
- The answer to Question 3 is incorrect. The only activity that appears exactly once is "Cancel_Order", but the LLM answered "Create_Order", which actually appears three times (once for each case).
- Given the strictness requested (even small errors must significantly decrease the score), providing a wrong answer for one of three questions should lose more than 3 points. Since two answers are correct and one is incorrect (and the incorrect one is not a partial error, but fully wrong), a substantial penalty is applied, but not the minimum as most of the response is accurate and formatted as requested.
- 4.5 reflects major point loss for the critical error but acknowledges the two correct answers.
