### Evaluation Reasoning (Strict Assessment):
- **Question 1**: Correct count (3 distinct cases) and identifies the exact set (C123, C456, C789), but lists them in a different order than the ground truth. This is a minor formatting difference, but under strict evaluation, it warrants a small deduction (e.g., ~0.5 points off from perfect).
- **Question 2**: Exact match to ground truth (Pack_Items precedes Ship_Order for C456, confirmed by chronological ordering in the log).
- **Question 3**: Major errorâ€”LLM incorrectly identifies "Create_Order" (which appears 3 times: C123 at 09:00, C456 at 09:10, C789 at 09:30), while ground truth correctly identifies "Cancel_Order" (appears exactly once: C789 at 09:45). This factual inaccuracy results in a near-total loss for this question.
- **Overall**: Strong on Q1/Q2 (weighted ~8/10 combined), but Q3 failure drags down significantly. No format penalties beyond Q1 order, as bullet points are concise and aligned with prompt request. Total reflects ~67% accuracy with strict penalty for the key error.
