9.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1**: Factually correct (3 distinct cases). The addition of the case list "(C001, C002, C003)" is extra and unrequested, introducing a minor deviation from the ground truth's concise "3". This is not a hallucination but reduces precision slightly under strict line-by-line scrutiny. (-0.5 points)
- **Q2**: Exact match in content and sequence to the ground truth, including activity names and separator. No differences. (Full points)
- **Q3**: Factually correctâ€”distinct predecessors (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) are identified accurately, alphabetized, and listed one per line. However, the ground truth includes bullet-style dashes ("- ") and <br> tags for formatting, which the LLM omits, resulting in a small formatting inconsistency. No extras or misses in content. (-0.5 points for strict adherence to ground truth presentation)

Overall, the response is highly accurate with no hallucinations, factual errors, or missing elements. The minor extras and formatting variances deduct only slightly due to the emphasis on factual precision over style.
