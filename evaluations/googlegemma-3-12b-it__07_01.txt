3.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Added tasks**: Partially correct (identified the two new tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`), but used only IDs instead of full names with IDs as in the ground truth, violating the instruction to use "element names exactly as they appear in the XML" (where names are attributes like "Check Customer VIP Status"). This is a format/content mismatch, warranting deduction. (-1.5 points from potential 3.0 for this section)
- **Removed tasks**: Completely incorrect; reported "(none)" but ground truth clearly shows `send_rma_label` ("Send RMA Label") was removed (present in v1 after `approve_return`, absent in v2). This is a factual omission of a key difference, a major error. (-3.0 points from potential 3.0)
- **Gateway type changes**: Mostly correct in identifying `gw_valid` change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway, but formatting is less precise (lacks version specifics and bolding as in ground truth). Minor deduction for style mismatch. (-0.5 points from potential 4.0)
- **Overall**: Headings match the bullet format required, and no speculation added (positive). However, the strictness criterion demands significant penalties for factual errors (missed removal) and even small format issues, resulting in a low score. No other differences were reported correctly beyond these.
