The LLM answer has several significant issues when compared to the ground truth:

- For "Added tasks", it only lists the element IDs ("check_vip" and "generate_qr") and fails to include their corresponding names as in the ground truth.  
- For "Removed tasks", it incorrectly outputs "(none)", missing the removal of "Send RMA Label" (id = "send_rma_label"), which is present in v1 but not in v2 and explicitly listed in the ground truth.
- For "Gateway type changes", it correctly identifies the gateway ID and the transition, but does not format the response as required (i.e., missing "changed from ... to ...").

These deviations—especially the missing removed task and insufficient detail in the added tasks—require a substantial deduction per the evaluation criteria.
