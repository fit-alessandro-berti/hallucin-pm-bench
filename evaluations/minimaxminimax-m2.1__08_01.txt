**9.5**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" with an accurate, error-free firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5 → T3) matching the ground truth's core sequence, complete with precise full markings (M0–M4) and a brief, correct justification of T5's enabling condition via the inhibitor arc. It fully addresses the prompt without extraneous or incorrect steps.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Less concise presentation and shorthand notation compared to ground truth.
- Lacking the ground truth's additional (accurate) insight that T5 "must" fire before T3 if it occurs at all (deeper enabling condition formalization and permanence of disablement post-T3), though not strictly required by the prompt's "justify briefly."

Note: Ground truth itself contains a small error (T4 firing is impossible post-T5/T3 as p3=0), but evaluation prioritizes LLM differences from it; LLM avoids this. Strict grading applied, but semantic match is near-perfect.
