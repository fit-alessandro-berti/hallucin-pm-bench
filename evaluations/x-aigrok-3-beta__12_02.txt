The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a one-paragraph justification that accurately cites the key counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7 and C005 line 11), matching the ground truth's core reasoning without factual errors. It proves the claim's falsity by highlighting the reversal in C003 and the absence of a preceding Receive_Order in C005. Minor deductions for slight hedging in phrasing ("within the visible log fragment" vs. the more definitive "never contains *Receive_Order* at all"), less emphatic structure (paragraph vs. bulleted counterexamples), and wording variations ("inaccurate" and "disproving" vs. "false" and "prove"), which introduce subtle imprecision under strict evaluation.
