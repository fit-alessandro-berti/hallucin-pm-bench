9.3

The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and identifies both counter-examples: C003 where *Validate_Payment* precedes *Receive_Order* (lines 6 and 7), and C005 where *Validate_Payment* occurs (line 11) with no *Receive_Order* event present. The explanation is clear and accurately cites both cases and line numbers. 

There is a small reduction in score because the LLM writes, “for case C003, *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 6 before *Receive_Order* at line 7, which contradicts the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order*.” This phrasing could be minimally improved for rigor, e.g., by specifying more explicitly that *Validate_Payment* does NOT follow *Receive_Order* in these cases, aligning more directly with the claim’s language. The LLM’s answer is also slightly less concise than the gold standard, but all core information is conveyed and cited.

Thus, 9.3/10 for strictly following instructions and accurately citing evidence, with only minor losses for optimal phrasing.
