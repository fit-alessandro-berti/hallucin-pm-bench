**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Decision points (major partial credit, -4.5 pts)**: Ground truth identifies **exactly 3 precise decision points** (eligibility in triage, amount threshold post-preapprove, final approval at preapprove/auditor). LLM scatters ~4-5 implied decisions across stages, correctly captures #1 (triage eligibility) and #2 (high-value branch) but invents extras (e.g., "pass initial submission" at Customer_Submit_Claim – not a decision; "compliance confirmed" at payment – misplaced as final decision). Misses #3's framing at approvals. Structure (per-stage list vs. clean table of only decisions) deviates significantly.
- **Required documents (partial credit with violations, -1.3 pts)**: GT provides **single complete list of exactly 7 defined artifacts**. LLM scatters docs per stage (incomplete as standalone list), covers ~80% correctly (RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail, BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF) but **introduces undefined artifacts** ("Exception filed", "Finance Approval Confirmation" – direct violation of "Do not introduce... artefacts not defined"). Misattributes EligibilityChecklist as "high-value only" (it's in step 3, pre-branch).
- **Fidelity to prompt/process (penalties, -0.0 extra as covered)**: Mentions legacy activity absence (unasked, minor bloat). Adds unasked summary, flowchart offer (noise). No other activities invented, but overall not a strict summary.
- **Strictness applied**: Introductions of undefined items = severe deduction (equivalent to ~30-40% loss); imprecise decisions/structure = another 30%; small misplacements/attributions = 10% each. Starts at 10, nets 4.2 for ~42% alignment.
