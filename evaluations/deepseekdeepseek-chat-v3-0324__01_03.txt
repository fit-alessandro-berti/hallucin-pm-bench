5.5

**Justification:**

a) **Decision points:**
- The LLM creates three "decision points" rather than just the true two. The "Tri-Color-Risk-Check Gate" is not a process gate as per the description: there is no auto-reject or decision at this point, it's just a risk rating step. This constitutes an extra/imagined gate, which is a substantive inaccuracy.
- The key rules for both genuine decision points are summarized reasonably well, but the TriVote is described slightly less precisely: there is no explicit statement of the approval threshold (just "at least 2 approvals out of 3"), and the mandatory role of the Sustainability Officer is not referenced, although this is less critical as the rule itself is correct.
- Most notably, it misses the explicit statement that a "manual underwriting" review is required if the conditional is not met, aligning incompletely with the official description.
- The language is less formal and strictly accurate than the ground truth.

b) **Required documents:**
- The sequence is partially correct, but with notable flaws:
    - Combines the three “Scorecard” documents into a single item, which loses granularity compared to the ground truth (where each Scorecard is an individual required document).
    - Omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77," which is specifically required during the applicant confirmation step.
    - Does not explicitly mention that only "Deck Memo" is required *if* the conditional is not met, but this is a lesser omission.
    - The order for "ID Matrix Declaration" and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is muddled (the ground truth lists "Signed Offer Sheet 77" before "ID Matrix Declaration").
- The LLM does correctly avoid hallucinating KYC/AML/credit-bureau files.

**Conclusion:**
This answer is readable and moderately close overall, but:
- Major point lost for inventing an extra gate.
- Penalty for failing document granularity/omission ("Signed Offer Sheet 77").
- Incomplete fidelity to process logic and document order.
Thus, a strict evaluation merits 5.5.
