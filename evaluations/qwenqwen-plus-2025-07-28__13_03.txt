7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the count as 1 for Q1, matching the ground truth exactly. For Q2, it aptly highlights the small sample size (3 cases) and non-representativeness for generalization, noting potential rarity and distortion from incompleteness, which aligns with core sampling issues. However, it loses points for lacking quantitative precision (e.g., no mention of 14 events, <2-hour span, frequency swing from 0% to 7%, or wide confidence intervals), omitting sampling error specifics for rare events, and ignoring near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check," "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and string/fuzzy matching pitfalls. These omissions make it less rigorous and analytical, reducing depth despite staying under 120 words.
