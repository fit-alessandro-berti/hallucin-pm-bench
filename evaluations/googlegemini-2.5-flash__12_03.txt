The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate ("No") and provides a precise justification by citing the two relevant counterexample cases (C002 and C004) with accurate sequences and timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns with the task's requirements to rely only on the log evidence and justify via relevant CaseIDs and sequences. However, under utmost strictness, it loses a full point for incompleteness: it omits analysis of the non-violating cases (C001 and C003, where the sequence holds), unlike the ground truth's comprehensive case-by-case table that explicitly verifies all instances to fully contextualize why the "always" assertion fails. No factual errors, but this structural difference (less exhaustive coverage) warrants the deduction.
