**Score: 8.0**

**Assessment:**

The LLM answer correctly answers "No", and provides a clear, specific justification by correctly citing Case C002 and Case C004, showing for each why the FACT is inaccurate. It concisely points out the intervening activities (Pack_Items, Check_Fraud) and their positions in the sequences, which directly addresses the claim in the FACT.

However, compared to the ground truth answer, there are several notable omissions:

- The LLM answer does not provide a case-by-case breakdown including positive examples (C001 and C003), where "Validate_Payment" *does* immediately follow "Receive_Order".  
- The ground truth gives a table structure, making it easier to cross-check each case's sequence. The LLM answer only includes the negative examples, potentially missing the full scope of evidence.
- The explicit mention of "2 out of 4 cases violate..." in the ground truth is not present in the LLM answer, which makes the strength of the justification somewhat weaker.
- The ground truth is explicit about the fact that the "always" is disproven owing to only partial complianceâ€”an important nuance not emphasized in the LLM response.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is correct, specific, and selects relevant evidence, but it lacks the full balanced review and the explicit, systematic structure of the ground truth. These omissions warrant a notable penalty, so a score of 8.0 is appropriate.
