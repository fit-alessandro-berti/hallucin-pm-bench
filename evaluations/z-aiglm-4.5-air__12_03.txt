9.0

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in both reasoning and accuracy.

**Strengths:**
- The answer gives the correct "No" verdict.
- It explicitly cites both C002 and C004 as counterexamples and clearly describes the intervening activities, which correctly disproves the universal claim in the FACT.
- It also briefly acknowledges that C001 and C003 do exhibit the immediate succession, matching the structure of the ground truth justification.

**Minor Omissions:**
- The LLMâ€™s justification is slightly less comprehensive than the ground truth. The ground truth uses a table to systematically assess all four cases, providing a clear and exhaustive checklist (including explicit checkmarks for each case, and short notes for every row).
- The LLM only overtly justifies C002 and C004, and very briefly alludes to C001 and C003. A more complete answer would list the sequences or explicitly mention all cases, providing symmetry and full coverage.

**No incorrect statements are present, but the answer would be improved with the thoroughness and clarity of the ground truth table. That small lack of detail deducts 1 point.**

**Score: 9.0**
