The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in content, structure, and reasoning: both correctly answer "No," identify the exact violating cases (C002 and C004) with precise sequences (Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment for C002; Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment for C004), acknowledge the compliant cases (C001 and C003), and conclude that the "always" claim fails due to these violations. Justification cites relevant CaseIDs and sequences as required, with no factual errors or omissions.

Minor deduction (-0.5) for presentation differences: the LLM uses concise paragraphs with timestamps (accurate but extraneous to the task), while the ground truth employs a structured table for case-by-case analysis, providing a more systematic visual breakdown. Under utmost strictness, this format variance reflects a slight deviation in meticulousness, though it does not impact the core validity.
