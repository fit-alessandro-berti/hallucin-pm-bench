The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, identifying the exact three decision points (**Underwriter Alignment Gate**, **Amount Threshold Decision**, **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**) with nearly identical descriptions and listing all required documents completely. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Format/structure differences** (major deduct): Bulleted list with bold headers vs. ground truth's numbered list with "####" headers, italicized sub-bullets, and "⇒" arrows; lacks contextual positioning ("branch after the Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check").
- **Phrasing differences in decision points** (moderate deduct): Minor rewordings e.g., "differ by ≤ 2 points" vs. "differ by ≤ 2"; "proceed to" vs. "send to"; "approve or reject" (lowercase) vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**"; omits "the board votes".
- **Phrasing differences in documents** (significant deduct per strictness, 3 instances): "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)". Lacks ground truth's "(complete list)" subheader and closing note.
- No omissions or additions, uses exact activity names, no standard terminology introduced.

These small-but-noticeable differences warrant a strong penalty, preventing a perfect score.
