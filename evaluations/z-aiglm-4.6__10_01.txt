The LLM answer correctly adheres to the vocabulary policy by using "KYC Review," "Order Vetting," and "Payment Clearance" without any forbidden terms. However, it introduces significant unwarranted content, including an introductory paragraph, a title, a detailed legend, and a separator line, none of which appear in the ground truth. More critically, the RACI allocations deviate substantially from the ground truth in multiple rows, violating the correctness criteria (e.g., not reflecting the narrative's implied responsibilities, lacking exactly one Responsible per activity in several cases, and incorrect Consulted roles). Specific mismatches include:

- **Receive Application**: Compliance Officer marked as I (should be C).
- **KYC Review**: All roles incorrect (Account Manager as C instead of A; Compliance Officer as A/R instead of R; Finance Clerk as I instead of C).
- **Order Vetting**: Compliance Officer as I (should be C).
- **Payment Clearance**: Account Manager as I (should be A); Compliance Officer as I (should be C); Finance Clerk as A/R (should be R, with no dual A/R).
- **Record Update**: Finance Clerk as I (should be C); IT Support as A/R (should be R only).
- **Notify Customer**: Matches ground truth.

Additionally, column headers include abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") not present in the ground truth, and formatting differences (e.g., consistent bolding of all activities vs. selective in ground truth; A/R notation vs. R/A or separate). These cumulative errors and additions result in a poor match, warranting a low score under strict evaluation.
