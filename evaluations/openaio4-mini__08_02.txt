**Score: 8.5**

The LLM answer is fundamentally correct for both questions:

- **Q1:** The LLM correctly answers "Yes."
- **Q2:** The LLM provides the correct minimal firing sequence: T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5.

**Strengths:**
- The firing sequence is correct and minimal.
- There are no critical conceptual errors.

**Weaknesses:**
- The answer omits any direct explanation as to why T3 cannot fire after T5, or how T5 disables T3 by consuming the token in P2. The ground truth specifies that T3 is disabled by T5, which the LLM omits; this is an important detail.
- The answer gives only the sequence, not the transitions' effects or markings for each step (unlike the ground truth).
- The step-by-step marking updates are missing.

Given these omissions, especially the lack of an explicit explanation regarding why T3 cannot fire after T5, the answer loses 1.5 points from a perfect score.
