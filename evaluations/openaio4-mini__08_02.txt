The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) for Q2, with a concise explanation matching the ground truth's core logic (using the P2 token and alternative path to P5 before T3). It stays under 120 words. Minor deduction for lacking explicit markings and the confirmatory note on T3 disablement, reducing evidential detail slightly, though not required by the prompt.
