GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES  
Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel  
Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel

**Reasoning**:  
- All functional changes are identified correctly.
- However, the required formatting (list item hyphens “-” at the start of each line, and name in parentheses immediately following the id with a space after the hyphen) is not adhered to. The answer omits the hyphens in lists and does not align the formatting of the GROUND TRUTH.
- The answer also omits indentation, and in GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES lacks space/alignment (“- Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel”).
- Task and gateway listing order matches, but the answer does not list items as per GROUND TRUTH, missing requested presentation specificity.
- Minor deviation in style leads to a significant penalty as requested. No relevant functional errors detected; penalties are for formatting/strict adherence to the instructions.
