The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks, the removed task, and the two gateway type changes, with exact IDs, names, and change descriptions matching the ground truth content and prompt specifications (e.g., "id (name)" format and "id: old â†’ new" without extraneous commentary). No unchanged elements are mentioned, adhering strictly to instructions. However, deducting 1.0 point for minor formatting discrepancies: absence of bullet points ("- ") before each list item and lack of alignment spacing in the second gateway entry, which slightly deviates from the ground truth's presentation despite not being explicitly mandated by the prompt.
