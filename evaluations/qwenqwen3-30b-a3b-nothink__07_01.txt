3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: The LLM answer incompletely identifies additions, listing only `generate_qr` (using the ID alone) while entirely omitting `check_vip`, a clear factual addition present in BPMN_v2 XML (`<task id="check_vip" name="Check Customer VIP Status"/>`) and absent in v1. The ground truth correctly includes both with full names and IDs. This is a critical factual error, as the prompt requires listing *all* factual differences using element names from the XML (which include both `id` and `name` attributes).
- **Removed tasks (moderate deduction: -1.5 points)**: Correctly identifies `send_rma_label` as removed (present in v1, absent in v2), but uses only the ID instead of the full element details like the ground truth (`Send RMA Label (id = `send_rma_label`)`). This deviates from using "element names exactly as they appear," treating the `name` attribute as integral.
- **Gateway type changes (minor deduction: -1.0 point)**: Captures the core change for `gw_valid` from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`, matching the XML (`<exclusiveGateway id="gw_valid"...>` in v1 vs. `<inclusiveGateway id="gw_valid"...>` in v2). However, phrasing and formatting differ slightly from the ground truth (e.g., no version labels "(v1)" and "(v2)", uses quotes instead of bolding), and does not use backticks for the ID.
- **Overall structure and adherence (minor deduction: -0.5 points)**: Headings match the prompt's specified format with bullets (â€¢), but the response lacks the exhaustive detail and precise presentation of the ground truth (e.g., no italics for names, incomplete specificity). No speculation or extras, which is positive, but strictness demands exact fidelity to XML elements.

Total: Starting from 10.0, deductions yield 3.0. The missing task alone warrants a failing-level score under utmost strictness, as it halves the accuracy of a key category.
