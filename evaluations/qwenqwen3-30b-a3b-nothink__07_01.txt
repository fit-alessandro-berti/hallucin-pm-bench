4.5

• Added tasks  
- "generate_qr" is correctly identified, but "check_vip" is missing. The added task "Check Customer VIP Status" (`check_vip`) is not listed, which is a significant omission.

• Removed tasks  
- Correct: "send_rma_label" is listed.

• Gateway type changes  
- Correct: "gw_valid" change is reported, with both gateway types.

Further issues:
- The LLM answer omits the element names and ids as they appear in the XML, while the ground truth shows both name and id for each addition/removal. The LLM uses only the id for generate_qr and send_rma_label, and includes neither id nor name for check_vip.
- There is no extra information given, so no points lost there.
- The formatting of headings is sufficient, but the instructions specify using element names "exactly as they appear in the XML," which for the "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks" is not strictly adhered to (e.g., "generate_qr" instead of "Generate RMA QR Code (id = `generate_qr`)").

Major point losses:
- Missing "check_vip" in Added tasks. (-4)
- Not showing both id and name together for listed tasks (-0.5)

Therefore, this response scores 4.5.
