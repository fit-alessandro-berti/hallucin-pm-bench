The LLM answer is highly accurate and comprehensive, correctly identifying the "No" compliance verdict and providing a clear, rule-by-rule justification that aligns closely with the ground truth. All rules are addressed with correct assessments (satisfied for 1, 2, and 4; violated for 3), and the violation reasoning for rule 3 is precise and equivalent in substance (NA precedes RA's completion, breaching the "after both QE and RA" requirement). Minor deductions for: (1) not explicitly stating "once each" for rule 1 (though implicitly correct via the trace), (2) using a list instead of a table format, and (3) adding extraneous elements like step numbering, a boxed final answer, and section headers not present in the ground truth, which slightly deviates from the "short justification" prompt while remaining concise overall.
