9.5

The LLM answer is correct in its overall judgment (No; the trace is non-compliant) and provides an analysis corresponding closely to the gold standard. The answer explicitly references all four rules, gives the required justification, and accurately identifies that rule 3 is violated because `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.

The only very minor deviations are:
- It does not use the precise tabular or mark-based breakdown of the gold standard answer; instead, it summarizes in paragraph/bullet format.
- The wording sometimes varies slightly (e.g., "before both QE and RA are complete" rather than "before RA is completed"), but this does not impact correctness.

Because the content is essentially accurate and all requirements are addressed with clear references to each rule, I deduct only half a point for the slightly less structured justification compared to the gold standard.

Final score: **9.5**
