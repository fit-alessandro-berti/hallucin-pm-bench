### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated vocabulary terms (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) without synonyms or leaks, earning partial credit for strict adherence to the vocabulary policy. However, it fails significantly in several areas with utmost strictness applied:

- **Activities (major errors, -4.0 points impact)**: The prompt requires covering "every activity" without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM adds unauthorized rows ("Schedule Payment" and "Release Funds and Notify"), which do not match the ground truth's structure. It splits/renames the final process step (ground truth merges into "Release Funds"), introducing extras beyond the four core activities plus "Compliance Officer Approval". This violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities".

- **RACI Assignments (major errors, -3.0 points impact)**: Assignments diverge substantially from ground truth across all rows. Examples:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM gives Front-Office Analyst only "R" (others "I"); ground truth specifies "R, A" for Front-Office, "C" for Compliance Analyst, dash for Officer, "I" for Treasury Ops.
  - **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**: LLM has Compliance Analyst as "R" (others "I/C"); ground truth has "R, A" for Compliance Analyst, "C" for Officer, dash for Front-Office, "I" for Treasury Ops.
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM has Front-Office "C", Compliance "R" (others "I"); ground truth has Compliance "R", Officer "A", Front-Office "C", Treasury "I".
  - Added rows have no ground truth equivalents, making them invalid.
  These are not minor; they misrepresent roles (e.g., no "A" combined notations, no dashes for non-involvement, over-assigning "I"/"C" to irrelevant roles).

- **Formatting and Structure (minor errors, -0.5 points impact)**: Markdown table is present and roles are correctly listed, but lacks bolding on activity names (ground truth uses **), no combined "R, A" notation, and no dashes (â€“). All roles are assigned something in every row, inflating involvement incorrectly.

Overall, while vocabulary is flawless (a strength), the core matrix content (activities and RACI) shows extensive deviations, warranting a low score. No criminal/jailbreak issues present.
