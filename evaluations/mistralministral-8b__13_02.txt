5.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Fully correct (1 time). No issues.
- **Question 2a**: Major error. Incorrectly states 4.17% (1/24 events), but ground truth is 2.08% (1/48 events). Fundamental miscount of total events (48, not 24) leads to wrong percentage. This is a deterministic numeric error, warranting severe deduction.
- **Question 2b**: Fully correct (8.33%, 1/12 cases).
- **Question 3**: Partially correct but superficial. Mentions rarity and non-representativeness leading to inaccuracy, touching on generalization risks, but fails to explicitly address single-occurrence vulnerability (e.g., noise/skewing averages, instability/variance, wide confidence intervals) as required. Lacks depth for full credit under strict criteria.

Overall: Strong on basics but undermined by critical counting/percentage error in 2a (core to the prompt) and shallow explanation in 3. Strict scoring penalizes factual inaccuracies heavily.
