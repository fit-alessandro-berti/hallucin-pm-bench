**4.0**

**Justification:**

1. **Question 1:** Correct. The answer states "1 time," matching the ground truth.

2. **Question 2a:** INCORRECT and critical. The LLM answered "4.17% of all events (1 out of 24 events)."  
  - The correct denominator is **48** events, not 24 (the log excerpt has 12 cases × 4 events each = 48 events, which matches the explicit list).
  - Correct percentage: **2.08%** (1/48 × 100).  
  - The LLM reports 4.17% (which is 1/24 × 100), a significant factual error demonstrating incorrect event counting.
  - This question is fully deterministic; the error demands major deduction.

3. **Question 2b:** Correct. "8.33% of unique cases (1 out of 12)" matches the ground truth.

4. **Question 3:** PARTIAL.  
    - The LLM mentions the rarity ("exceptional case", "may not be representative"), but does not clearly state the specific dangers: that with only one observation, any performance or predictive metric is unstable or unreliable.
    - The reference to possible inaccuracy is present but vague; it lacks mention of instability/variance or confidence interval.
    - It cautions against generalization but without required specific technical warning about the impact on metric calculation and inference.  
    - Does not touch on "skew," variance, or the unreliability of mean/cycle time/statistics based on a single case (all essential points as specified).

**Summary:**
- Factual error in 2a (almost double the real value).
- 3 is only partially aligned: caution is too generic/not technically sharp.
- Both errors are significant: **major deduction required.**

**Final score: 4.0**
