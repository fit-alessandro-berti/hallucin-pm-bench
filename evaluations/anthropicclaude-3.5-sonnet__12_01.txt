10.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and fully aligned with the ground truth in verdict, structure, and evidence. It correctly identifies the fact as false, examines all relevant cases (1001, 1002, 1003), notes the reversed ordering where both activities appear, highlights the absence in Case 1002 to disprove "always," and explicitly addresses the "immediately before" claim in its conclusion. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., "INCORRECT" vs. "inaccurate"; no line citations, though not required by the prompt) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as the justification strictly cites case IDs and activities without fabrication or omission.
