5.5

The LLM answer scores a 5.5/10.0. Here is the breakdown for strict evaluation:

**Strengths:**
- The mandated vocabulary terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) are used exclusively, as required.
- Activity names and role names in the table match the authorized values and instructions.

**Major errors:**
1. **Activities deviating from ground truth or adding/omitting**:  
   - The LLM answer adds non-authorized activities: “Approve Escalated Case”, “Schedule Payment”, and “Notify Originator”, which are **not** listed in the ground truth. “Compliance Officer Approval” should have been the only approval-step activity.
   - The LLM omits “Compliance Officer Approval” (with that exact name).
   - “Schedule Payment” is not included in the ground truth or process narrative as an independent, authorized activity.
2. **Misassignment of RACI values**:  
   - Many assignments disagree significantly with the ground truth:
     - In “Intake Vetting”, the Compliance Analyst is “C” in the ground truth but only “I” in the LLM answer; Treasury Ops is “I” in ground truth but omitted in LLM.
     - “KYC Review”: Compliance Officer is “C” in ground truth, but “A” in LLM; Treasury Ops should be “I” (ground truth), but is omitted.
     - “AML Screening”: Compliance Officer is “C” in ground truth, but “A” in LLM; Treasury Ops again missing “I”.
     - “Risk Scoring”: Compliance Officer is “A” (ground truth), but “A” is with Compliance Analyst in LLM; Front-Office Analyst is “C” (ground truth), but omitted in LLM.
     - “Compliance Officer Approval” is replaced by non-standard “Approve Escalated Case”.
     - “Release Funds”: Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer should both be “C” according to ground truth, but are omitted in LLM answer; Front-Office Analyst should be “I”, but marked as “I” in another (non-standard) activity.
3. **Extraneous activities:**  
   - Non-authorized activities break the “do not add activities” instruction (e.g., “Schedule Payment”, “Notify Originator”).
4. **Markup:**  
   - The LLM answer omits the "dash (—)" for non-involved roles, instead leaving cells blank. This is specifically called out in judging notes.

**Minor Issues:**
- Formatting (dashes in empty cells), though secondary, is still not perfect.

**Summary:**  
The LLM answer followed the vocabulary rules and basic structure, but made substantial process errors by adding, renaming, and omitting activities; and by misassigning responsibilities, especially Accountable/Consulted roles, per the ground truth. Per instructions, even small errors reflect in a significant points loss, but this answer fundamentally mishandles core RACI and process mapping requirements, meriting only a middle score.
