### Evaluation Rationale
- **Core Correctness (High Weight)**: The LLM answer ultimately reaches the correct conclusion ("YES") and provides a valid, concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) that matches the ground truth up to the point of demonstrating T5 firing before T3. This is the essential requirement of the prompt. No factual errors in the final sequence or enabling conditions (p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0 via inhibitor arc).
  
- **Differences and Errors (Significant Deduction)**: 
  - The answer includes an initial incorrect conclusion ("NO") with a flawed proof attempt, followed by a self-revision. This introduces unnecessary confusion and demonstrates incomplete initial reasoning, violating strictness—small errors like hesitation or partial wrong analysis warrant substantial point loss (deduct ~2.0 points).
  - The justification is basic and accurate but lacks depth: it doesn't explain the permanence of T5's disablement after T3 (as in ground truth) or the "must fire before T3 if it occurs" nuance. The ground truth emphasizes that T5 is *only* reachable before T3, which the LLM omits, making it less comprehensive (deduct ~0.5 points).
  - Sequence is shorter; ground truth extends it to show post-T5 behavior (T3 → T4), highlighting broader implications, but the prompt only requires a sequence up to T5 before T3, so minor deduction.

- **Overall Strictness**: Under utmost strictness, the flawed reasoning process and incomplete depth prevent a perfect score, but the final output satisfies the prompt's core ask (possibility + sequence + brief justification).
