4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Correctness (Major Issue)**: The LLM correctly identifies non-compliance ("No") and pinpoints the core violation in Rule 3 (NA occurring too early, specifically before RA). However, it fabricates a violation of Rule 1 by incorrectly claiming the QE → RA order is "broken" due to NA intervening—Rule 1 only requires QE before RA (which holds true), not that nothing else can occur between them. This is a significant factual error, as the ground truth explicitly marks Rule 1 as satisfied.
- **Factual Inaccuracies (Penalty)**: In Rule 3 justification, the LLM wrongly states NA occurs "even before QE" (it actually follows QE in the trace), introducing an unnecessary and incorrect detail that misrepresents the trace sequence.
- **Completeness (Penalty)**: The prompt requires referencing *each rule* (satisfied or violated). The LLM ignores Rules 2 and 4 entirely, while the ground truth assesses all four explicitly (correctly finding 2 and 4 satisfied). This omission makes the justification incomplete and less rigorous.
- **Structure and Clarity (Minor Credit)**: The response is concise and structured as a short justification, but lacks the comprehensive, rule-by-rule breakdown of the ground truth (e.g., no assessment of satisfaction for non-violated rules).
- **Strictness Applied**: Per instructions, these errors (one major misassessment, one factual misstatement, and incompleteness) warrant substantial deduction from a potential 10.0. The partial accuracy on the primary violation prevents a failing score below 4.0.
