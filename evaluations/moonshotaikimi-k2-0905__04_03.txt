6.0

- The LLM answer accurately concludes "No," correctly determining non-compliance.
- The justification finds that Rule 3 is violated, which is correct, as "Notify_Authorities" occurs before "Regulatory_Affairs_Review" is complete.
- The LLM also asserts a violation of Rule 1, which is incorrect â€“ in the trace, "Quality_Engineer_Review" does precede "Regulatory_Affairs_Review" and both occur once. Rule 1 is satisfied.
- The LLM does not comment on Rule 2 or Rule 4 at all, omitting necessary justification per instructions.
- Lack of explicit reference to rules that are satisfied, as required; important context about "severity = High" and VP_Safety_Approval position is missing.
- Overall, the answer reaches the correct conclusion with partial but incomplete and erroneous rule analysis. Multiple small but significant errors warrant a strict penalty.
