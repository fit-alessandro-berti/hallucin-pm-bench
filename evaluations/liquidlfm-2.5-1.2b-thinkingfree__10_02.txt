**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically on every criterion: 
- No comprehensive coverage of all 6 tasks from the source text (only a generic single-row table with no task mappings).
- Invalid Markdown table structure (incomplete, fragmented, non-functional with repeated failed attempts).
- Exposes internal reasoning, confusion, and self-corrections ("Wait, but...", "Hmm stuck.", "Final attempt"), violating clean output expectations.
- Does not properly map informal steps to mandated terms (e.g., no "**KYC Review**" for step 3, no distinct handling of screening/logging/release vs. approval/archiving).
- Introduces redundancy and illogic (repeating "Transaction Analyst" inappropriately across columns without task context).
- Ground truth is a complete, accurate RACI with per-task rows, mandated vocabulary integrated (e.g., "**KYC Review**"), logical role assignments (including necessary non-mandated roles like IT Support), and legend—LLM matches ~0% of this structure/content. Even minor adherence (e.g., using mandated terms) is undermined by total structural collapse.
