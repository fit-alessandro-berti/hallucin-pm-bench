**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary policy violations (critical failure, -4.0)**: Forbidden terms "Customer Due Diligence" and "Order Validation" appear explicitly in row headers (even with mandated terms in brackets), directly contravening the **STRICT** policy ("never mention the forbidden terms, even in brackets or quotes"). "Payment Clearance" is used correctly, but this does not offset the violations.
- **RACI correctness (total mismatch, -3.0)**: Allocations deviate substantially from ground truth:
  | Activity | Key Errors |
  |----------|------------|
  | Receive Application | Missing CO=C, FC=I, IT=I; AM only R (GT: R/A). |
  | KYC Review | Missing AM=A, FC=C, IT=I; simplistic CO=R only. |
  | Order Vetting | Two **R**s (AM, FC) violates "exactly one Responsible"; missing CO=C, FC=I, IT=I; GT has AM R/A only. |
  | Payment Clearance | Missing AM=A, CO=C, IT=I. |
  | Record Update | All blanks except IT=R; missing AM=C, CO=I, FC=C. |
  | Notify Customer | IT=A invented; missing all I's; GT has only AM R/A. |
  - No full RACI spectrum (C/I omitted, blanks misused as "not involved").
- **Format/structure (-1.0)**: Extra full role names in headers (GT abbreviated); inconsistent bolding; non-standard table styling (e.g., em-dashes).
- **Unwarranted content (-1.0)**: Extensive notes invent details (e.g., FC "updates records"; IT "technical support for email"; AM "end-to-end owner"), adding unsupported narrative. Extra "Key" and closing statement bloat response.
- **No partial credit**: Ground truth notes demand *exact* alignment (one R/activity, mandated terms pure, no extras). LLM fails on all rubric points despite partial mandated term usage. Zero alignment justifies minimum score.
