4.0

**Reasoning:**

- The LLM answer gets the general approach to the RACI format correct, but there are several major issues and numerous minor ones compared to the strict ground truth, warranting a low score:

**Major Errors:**
1. **Omission of Operations Manager:** The table is missing the "Operations Manager" role entirely, which is present and **accountable** for every activity in the ground truth. This is a critical omission (deduct at least 2 points).
2. **Accountability Misassignments:** The Regulatory Liaison is frequently marked as both Responsible and Accountable ("R, A") in the same cell, which doesn't reflect the division of duties set in the ground truth.
3. **Incorrect RACI Assignments:**  
   - The Transaction Analyst is solely “Responsible” for steps they should only be “Consulted” or “Informed” about (e.g., KYC Review).
   - "Regulatory Liaison" is not *Accountable* in relevant steps (e.g., “Screen Against Sanctions”), while the ground truth says otherwise.
   - "IT Support" roles are conflated and not matched to the correct RACI assignments per activity.
4. **Non-mandated Activities Added:** Extra activities (like a line for "Notify Regulatory Liaison upon archiving") are introduced that are not listed as separate steps in either the source or ground truth (deduct for introducing steps).

**Minor Errors:**
- Some task names aren't strictly mapped to the mandated terms as shown in the ground truth (e.g., "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" instead of just "KYC Review"), reflecting lack of strict adherence (deduct at least 1 point).
- Formatting: The legend is included, but table formatting omits bolding mandated terms and doesn't match the precision of the ground truth (minor deduction).
- Role columns: There is an unnecessary "Customer" column that is nowhere in the ground truth and not instantiated in the RACI assignments.

**Summary:**  
While the LLM answer does create a Markdown RACI table and uses mainly the right mandated terms for roles, the structural errors, omission of the Operations Manager, inaccuracies in RACI attributions, and extra/unfaithful activities show substantial divergence from the ground truth. Even small deviations weighed heavily. Hence: **4.0/10**.
