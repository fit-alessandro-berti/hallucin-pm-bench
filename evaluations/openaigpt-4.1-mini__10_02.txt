### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Columns/Roles**: LLM introduces an unnecessary "Customer" column (absent from source or mandated terms) and omits "Operations Manager" (present in ground truth, implying an accountability layer). This violates the prompt's emphasis on using *only* mandated terms for roles while mapping the source, and alters the RACI structure fundamentally. Ground truth sticks to relevant roles including an oversight one, making LLM's setup incomplete and extraneous.

- **Task Mapping and Wording**: LLM's tasks are wordy and not fully aligned with mandated vocabulary or concise phrasing in ground truth (e.g., LLM: "Receive customer transfer instruction and log in system" vs. GT: "Receive Payment Instruction"). LLM splits step 5 into two rows ("Release approved payment" and "Ensure SWIFT message is sent") and step 6 into two ("Archive case file" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison upon archiving"), creating 7 rows with duplicate numbering. Ground truth consolidates into 6 efficient tasks, integrating SWIFT/send into "Release Payment" and notification into "Archive Record" via RACI (e.g., RL as I). This results in omissions (e.g., no explicit SWIFT handling in GT's combined task) and inventions (separate notify row), failing to "cover every task... without omissions or substitutions."

- **RACI Assignments**: Almost no alignment. For example:
  - Screening (task 2): LLM assigns only TA R (blanks elsewhere); GT has TA R, RL A, Ops M I, IT C.
  - KYC Review (task 3): LLM only RL R,A; GT has C for TA, R for RL, A for Ops M, I for IT.
  - Similar mismatches across all tasks (e.g., release: LLM TA R only; GT TA R, RL I, Ops M A, IT C). No task has identical assignments even in overlapping columns. LLM lacks any "C" (Consulted) assignments despite including it in the legend, underutilizing RACI.

- **Vocabulary and Mandates**: LLM correctly uses "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst" where applicable, but fails to fully enforce by introducing unmandated elements (Customer column) and not mirroring ground truth's precise, mandated-focused phrasing (e.g., GT specifies "**KYC Review**" as a bolded activity header).

- **Overall Structure and Clarity**: LLM's table is mostly clear but cluttered with blanks, duplicate numbers, and an unused legend entry (C). Ground truth is more organized with bolded R/A for emphasis, a descriptive header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), and integrated coverage. LLM's expansions (e.g., "upon archiving" in notify) add unsubstantiated details not in the source.

These errors—structural, content, and fidelity to source/mandates—represent major failures in replicating the ground truth, with small issues (e.g., wording inconsistencies) compounding the loss. A perfect match would score 10.0; this is closer to minimal effort despite some correct vocabulary usage.
