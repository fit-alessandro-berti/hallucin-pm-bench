The LLM answer is concise and correctly identifies both sets of parallel tasks in Process B, following the order they appear. It accurately lists the pairs as concurrent under each parallel split, and provides no extraneous information about Processes A or C, as required.

However, there are some notable differences from the ground truth that warrant loss of a full point:

- The LLM does not explicitly label which set corresponds to which parallel block (e.g., "first parallel block," "second parallel block"). This lack of explicit mapping, while it can be inferred from the order, is less precise than the ground truth.
- The use of a comma instead of the parallel notation (‖) further diverges from the format in the ground truth.
- The ground truth also explicitly repeats that “No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel,” which the LLM omits. This is additional confirming information absent from the LLM answer.

These differences, while not critical to factual correctness, show less rigor and detail in following both the content and format of the ground truth, justifying a significant score reduction.
