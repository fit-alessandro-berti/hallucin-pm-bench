5.5

### Rationale:

Applying strict grading, reflecting not only what is missing or inaccurate, but also whether wording and explicitness match the expectations set by the Ground Truth:

#### Added Tasks:
- The LLM omits **Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`), which is a significant error. This is a clear and concrete added task in v2.
- The LLM says:  
  - "Task_RequestDocs (previously unnamed step for requests)": The "previously unnamed step" is inaccurate and unnecessary speculation.  
  - "Task_FinalReject (formerly handled by standalone Reject Loan task)": This is not the correct way to describe adding a task; the Ground Truth simply lists the task and its ID.
- The heading is present, but only 2 of the required 3 tasks are correctly identified.

#### Removed Tasks:
- Correctly identifies "**Task_RejectLoan**", although the LLM adds speculative commentary ("task logic partially replaced by new rejection path"), which is unnecessary per the instructions.

#### Gateway-Type Changes:
- The LLM accurately notes the change from **exclusive** to **inclusive** gateway at "Gateway_Decision", which matches the Ground Truth.
- However, it adds: "Adjusted **Gateway_Decision** output flow structure (now includes multiple outgoing paths)". This is not required according to the question, which asks only for gateway *type* changes, not flow changes.

#### Other Considerations:
- The LLM does not precisely follow the required explicit style, and occasionally adds unnecessary justifications/speculations, violating instructions for strict summarization.
- The "formerly handled by..." and "previously unnamed step for requests" comments are not called for.
- Omits a factual, "added task".

#### Summary of main discrepancies:
- Misses a key added task (**Verify Identity**).
- Adds speculative or unnecessary details.
- Partially diverges from the concise, direct reporting style of the key.

**Deductions:**
- Omission of one out of three "Added tasks": −2
- Inclusion of unnecessary and slightly misleading commentary/speculation (in two sections): −1
- Minor error in mentioning output flow structure under gateway-type, which does not count as a gateway-type change per instructions: −1
- Strictness applied to formatting and style against explicit ground truth expectation: −0.5

**Final Score: 5.5**
