5.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer partially identifies changes but contains significant omissions, inaccuracies, and deviations from the strict requirements, warranting a moderate-to-low score under utmost strictness.

- **Added tasks**: Major deduction for missing the key addition of "Verify Identity" (Task_VerifyIdentity), which is a clear new task in v2 (after StartEvent). Only two of three are listed, and the inclusion of speculative/incorrect commentary (e.g., "previously unnamed step" – there was no such unnamed step; "formerly handled by standalone Reject Loan task" – this misattributes origins) introduces errors not present in ground truth. Format uses bullets instead of numbered list, but this is minor.

- **Removed tasks**: Correctly identifies the sole removal (Task_RejectLoan), but adds interpretive commentary ("task logic partially replaced") that goes beyond plain summarization and isn't in ground truth, violating strictness.

- **Gateway-type changes**: Correctly notes the core change (exclusive to inclusive), including the gateway ID. However, adds an extraneous point about "output flow structure" (multiple paths), which is a flow/structural change, not a "gateway-type" change (per prompt example: e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive). This misplaces content and inflates the section unnecessarily. Ground truth keeps it concise and explanatory (XOR/OR) without extras.

Overall, the answer covers ~70% of the factual content accurately but misses a critical addition, adds unsupported/misleading details, and slightly deviates in categorization and format, leading to substantial point loss per strict criteria. No mention of "no other changes," which ground truth includes for completeness.
