The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps or duration data, aligning closely with the ground truth's core reasoning (no timestamps/durations, only counts, missing start-completion intervals). Wording is nearly identical in substance ("cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; both cite lack of timestamps/durations and event counts/frequencies). Minor deductions for: (1) exceeding the prompt's "one concise sentence" instruction by adding a bold statement + separate explanation paragraph (ground truth is a single sentence); (2) slight phrasing variations (e.g., "cycle time (i.e., the time from 'start' to 'complete')" adds elaboration not in ground truth); (3) unnecessary bolding/structure absent in ground truth. These are small format/content expansions but warrant point loss under utmost strictness.
