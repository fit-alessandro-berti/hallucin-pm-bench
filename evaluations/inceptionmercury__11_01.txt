7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (Supporting Higher Score)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quoting exact figures from the table (e.g., 36.5/120.0, 12.2/44.0, 7.8/16.4 hours) without any deviations. No unwarranted content (e.g., no service times, throughput, or other activities) is included. The memo format is crisp, professional, and under 150 words (~120 words). Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for document delays), and explicitly target ≥20% reductions.

- **Weaknesses (Causing Deduction)**: Significant differences from ground truth include format (full memo with subject/greeting/sign-off vs. concise bullets) and action specificity. LLM actions are relevant but less "data-driven" (generic suggestions like "implement automated system" without references to pilots, tests, or quantified estimates >20%, e.g., no "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%"). Ground truth actions are more precise and evidence-based, making LLM's feel underdeveloped. Minor stylistic variances (e.g., spelling out "hours" vs. "h"/"p95" abbreviations) add slight polish gaps. Under utmost strictness, these content and depth differences warrant a meaningful deduction from a perfect score.
