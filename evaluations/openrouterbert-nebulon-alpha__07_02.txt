**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (core accuracy, ~90% match)**: Correctly identifies all added tasks (3/3: VerifyIdentity, RequestDocs, FinalReject), removed task (1/1: RejectLoan), and sole gateway change (Exclusive → Inclusive for Gateway_Decision). No factual errors or misses; ignores irrelevant flows/reordering as required.
- **Penalties (significant for strictness, -1.8 total)**:
  - **Format/structure differences (-0.6)**: Uses bullet lists and ID-first order (`ID` ("name")) vs. ground truth's numbered lists and name-first (**name** (`ID`)); headings with ### vs. *; adds unrequested intro ("Here is the summary...") and no closing "(No other...)".
  - **Extra content violating "ignore cosmetic renamings" (-0.6)**: Includes gateway name change ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check") under gateway section, despite explicit instruction to ignore renamings.
  - **Unrequested analysis (-0.6)**: Adds explanatory text on inclusive gateway behavior ("now allows multiple... mutually exclusive in practice"), beyond strict summarization.
- **Overall**: Semantically precise but deviates in presentation/extras; small errors (per strict criteria) deduct notably from 10.0, yet not low enough for major content flaws (e.g., no 1.0-5.0).
