**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (max ~5.0 points possible)**: Ground truth identifies exactly **2** decision points/gates: (1) the post-Tri-Color conditional skip (risk Low/Medium **AND** ≤ €250 000), (2) TriVote (≥2/3 approvals). LLM correctly identifies the 2 real ones with accurate rules/phrasing (~80% match), but erroneously adds a **3rd** ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome" as a "decision point"), which is just a step producing an input, not a gate/branch (-1.5 pts). Minor phrasing diffs (e.g., "€250,000 or less" vs. "≤ €250 000"; "passes if at least two" vs. "advance only when at least two") are close but not identical (-0.3 pts). **Score: 3.2/5.0**.
- **Part (b) - Documents (-5.0 points possible)**: Ground truth lists **9** items in precise first-appearance order, including **3 Scorecards** (explicit step 3 inputs/documents) and **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (distinct in step 8). LLM lists only **5**, **omitting all 3 Scorecards** (critical; they appear before Deck Memo) and **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (separate from unsigned in step 7) (-3.0 pts for omissions). Listed items are in relative order but incomplete/inaccurate set (-1.0 pt); no hallucinations (good, but doesn't offset). **Score: 1.0/5.0**.
- **Overall Structure/Completeness**: Matches bolded sections/headings; concise sentences per prompt. But strict policy: "small errors... significant loss"; major omissions/extra content = large deductions. No policy violations. **Total: 3.2/10.0** (weighted average; b) drags down heavily due to ~44% missing docs).
