The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and directly fulfills the task requirements with no errors, omissions, or deviations from the evidence. It correctly answers "No" and provides precise justification citing the exact relevant CaseIDs (C002, C004) and activity sequences with timestamps, directly disproving the "always" claim via counterexamples. While the ground truth uses an exhaustive case-by-case table (including compliant cases C001/C003 for completeness), the task only requires justification via *relevant* CaseIDs and sequences—counterexamples alone suffice to refute "always," making the LLM response equivalently correct and more concise without sacrificing rigor. No differences impact factual accuracy, adherence to the prompt, or evidential reliance.
