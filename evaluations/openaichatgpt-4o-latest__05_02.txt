The LLM's answer is nearly identical to the ground truth, proposing the correct and minimal XML change (reducing the due date for "Collect Equipment" from 5 to 2 days in a single diff hunk). The diff format and content are exactly correct.

The rationale is clear and directly references the effect on downstream delays and SLA compliance. However, the rationale wording is slightly different from the ground truth: the LLM does not specifically cite the "3-day SLA" or use the phrase "without introducing any new activities." Also, the mention of "aligning with tight SLA windows for system access provisioning" is less precise than referencing the explicit contractual SLA.

Because the prompt calls for "utmost strictness" and small errors should significantly affect the score, this lack of explicit reference to the actual SLA timeframe (3 days) and the less specific wording constitute a small but notable deviation. Therefore, a 1-point penalty is applied.
