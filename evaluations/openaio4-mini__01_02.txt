7.5

The LLM answer accurately identifies and describes the three key decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with correct logic and terminology from the process flow, without introducing forbidden standard loan terms. It also lists all six required documents completely and in the correct order. However, it loses points for strictness due to: (1) incomplete specification of flow positions (omits "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for the Amount Threshold Decision and "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for the Underwriter Alignment Gate); (2) minor phrasing variances in decision points (e.g., "> 2 points" vs. "else"; "proceed to" vs. "continue/send to"; "approve or reject" lowercase vs. "**Approve** or **Reject**" emphasized; added "skips the Micro-loan Board" and "the application" not in ground truth); (3) wording differences in three document descriptions (extra "old" in Proof of Address; extra "single" and "or" vs. "/" in Latest Income Statement; extra "template" in Community Impact Statement); and (4) structural differences (bullets vs. numbered list; no extra clarifying note on non-required documents, though this is minor as the task focuses on listing requisites). These small but cumulative deviations prevent a perfect score under utmost strict evaluation criteria.
