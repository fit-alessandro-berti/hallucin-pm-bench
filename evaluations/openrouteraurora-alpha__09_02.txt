The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps as the reason the average cycle time cannot be calculated, and it adheres to the prompt's requirement for a single concise sentence. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be calculated" vs. "impossible to compute"; omission of explicit "for 'Dual Authorization'" and "event counts" phrasing, though contextually implied and not erroneous).
