9.5

- The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all factual points.
- The format is concise bullets, as requested (though bullets are Unicode "â€¢" instead of "*", but that's a negligible stylistic deviation).
- The names and capitalization are consistent with the prompt.
- The only minor deviation is that the wording for "distinct cases" is not 100% identical ("There are 3 distinct cases (C123, C456, C789)" vs "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"), but this does not affect factual correctness and follows the concise bullet requirement.
- The LLM answer correctly avoids extraneous or verbose text.

Only a minor stylistic difference (using a full sentence for the first bullet) prevents a perfect score.
