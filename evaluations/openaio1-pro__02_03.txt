The LLM answer is factually correct and uses bullet points as required, with no errors in content or analysis of the event log. However, it deducts points for minor differences in conciseness and phrasing compared to the ground truth: Q1 adds unnecessary "There are 3 distinct" verbiage; Q2 and Q3 use full explanatory sentences instead of the minimal direct responses (just the counts/names); and formatting lacks the exact "A1/A2/A3" labeling. Under strict evaluation, these stylistic deviations warrant a deduction despite perfect accuracy.
