The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence matching the ground truth, including the same path (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) and key reasoning about preserving the P2 token without firing T3. Markings and explanations align closely, confirming T5 precedes T3 by consuming P2, disabling T3 afterward. Minor deductions for excessive verbosity (exceeds 120-word limit by ~300% in Q1 explanation, adding redundant case analysis despite accurate content) and formatting variations (e.g., LaTeX vs. plain text subscripts), but no factual errors or omissions.
