9.2

The LLM answer is nearly perfect, correctly identifying every added and removed task and precisely summarizing the gateway-type change.

**Positives:**
- All added tasks are properly listed by both name and ID.
- The removed task is correctly named and placed.
- Gateway-type change is identified, explained, and the IDs and types mapped precisely.
- The answer does **not** include irrelevant categories or cosmetic/structure changes.

**Minor deductions (for utmost strictness):**
- The LLM answer adds detail (e.g., “after the Start Event…”) that, while correct, was not requested. The grading prompt demands *strict* alignment and penalizes even small deviations in format or wording.
- For “Gateway-type changes,” the LLM uses explanatory phrasing (“reflecting a shift from an XOR decision (one path only) to an OR decision (multiple paths possible)”). The ground truth is strictly factual and terse — more explanation than required is a minor deviation.
- In the “Added Tasks” and “Removed Tasks” lists, the LLM titles each item with the technical ID first (e.g., **Task_VerifyIdentity**), followed by the label, while the ground truth uses natural-language names first, then IDs in parentheses. This is a very minor formatting mismatch.

For these minor format and brevity issues — not content accuracy — I deduct 0.8 points.

**Final score:** 9.2
