9.0

The LLM answer accurately identifies all added tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), the single removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the gateway-type change (exclusive to inclusive) without omissions or inaccuracies in content. It ignores irrelevant cosmetic changes (e.g., task name updates like "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan", gateway name changes) as required. However, it deducts points for minor differences: unnecessary descriptive details about task positions and flow outcomes (e.g., "added after the Start Event and before...", "as an outcome of the decision gateway"), which exceed the concise summary style of the ground truth; slightly verbose gateway explanation (e.g., "reflecting a shift from an XOR decision..."); and formatting variances (e.g., full sentences and bolded IDs vs. ground truth's numbered list with name then (ID)). These small deviations from strict conciseness result in a 1.0-point loss under utmost strict evaluation criteria.
