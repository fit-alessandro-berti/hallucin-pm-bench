9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes: 3 added tasks, 1 removed task, and 2 gateway type changes, matching the ground truth content exactly. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs deductions for format deviations from the ground truth:
- Extra "-" prefixes before each of the 3 headings.
- Use of backticks around all IDs (absent in ground truth).
- Indented plain lines instead of bulleted lists with "-" (6 list items affected).
- Minor lack of alignment spacing in gateway changes (e.g., ground truth pads the second gateway line).

These are small but consistent formatting errors, warranting a significant but not drastic deduction from a perfect score, as content is flawless and closely follows prompt examples.
