6.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the "No" verdict and provides an accurate justification for one key counter-example (C003, with proper line citations), which alone disproves the "always" claim. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs significant point loss for incompleteness: it omits the equally critical C005 counter-example (Validate_Payment at line 11 without any Receive_Order in that case), which the ground truth explicitly includes as a second violation. This partial coverage represents a meaningful difference from the comprehensive ground truth, reducing the score despite the paragraph format and citation adherence.
