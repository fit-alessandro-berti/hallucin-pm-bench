The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and cites case C003 (lines 6 and 7), which is a valid counter-example to the claim. However, it fails to mention the second, critical counter-example provided in the ground-truth: case C005, in which *Validate_Payment* (line 11) occurs without any *Receive_Order* event at all in that case. Omitting this example is a significant omission, as it demonstrates the claim's falsehood in an additional, distinct way. According to the instruction for utmost strictness, this missing evidence and the lack of completeness incurs a significant penalty, though the answer is otherwise clear and correct for the example given.
