**3.5**

### Evaluation Breakdown (for transparency, not part of output format):
- **Correct identification of issue/element (major partial credit)**: Both target the same `Task_CollectEquipment` and `camunda:dueDate="P5D"` bottleneck (+3.0).
- **Diff content error (major deduction)**: Changes to `P1D` instead of exact `P2D` match (-2.0); format is superior (line numbers, headers) but content mismatch dominates.
- **Diff format (minor credit)**: Proper unified diff hunk with files/line numbers (+0.5).
- **Rationale error (major deduction)**: Different value (1D vs. 2D), invented "business-week SLA" vs. ground truth's "3-day SLA", altered reasoning (-2.0); still one sentence.
- **Strictness adjustment**: Single character/value diff (`1` vs. `2`) treated as significant error per instructions, no other violations. Total reflects ~65% match but penalized heavily for mismatches.
