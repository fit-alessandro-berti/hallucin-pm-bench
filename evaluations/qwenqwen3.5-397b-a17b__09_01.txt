The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in core conclusion (cannot compute/derive the value), primary reasoning (missing timestamps/durations), and adherence to instructions (refuse unsupported metrics, explain clearly). Stylistic differences (e.g., formatting, explicit benchmark mention, phrasing like "derived" vs. "computed") are negligible and do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as both fully and accurately address the two-part query without fabrication.
