10.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly aligns with the ground truth in verdict ("not accurate"/"false" vs. "inaccurate"/"false"), key evidence (reversed order in cases 1001/1003, absence in 1002), and overall reasoning (disproving the "always immediately before" claim via counterexamples). It cites relevant cases and activities without errors, omissions, or extraneous details, fully satisfying the prompt's requirements for a short, evidence-based justification. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., bolding, no line references) do not impact correctness.
