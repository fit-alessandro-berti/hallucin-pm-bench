**9.2**

The LLM answer excels in correctness (exact match on top 3 activities ranked by avg waiting time, verbatim quotes of both avg and 95th-percentile values from table). No unwarranted content (no service times, throughput, or other activities). Format is a crisp executive memo (<100 words) with professional header. Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting times (e.g., reminders for customer delays in #1, batching for internal #2), and explicitly promise ≥20% cut (summary statement).

Minor deductions (-0.8 total): 
- Actions differ from ground truth in specifics/wording (e.g., LLM #2 batched generation vs. GT e-signatures; #3 triage/prioritize vs. pre-classify bypass—LLM's arguably less optimal for average wait reduction).
- Lacks per-action "data-driven" phrases like GT's "pilot tests"/"estimated %" (general summary instead, slightly less explicit).
- Formatting variances (bold headers, pipes vs. em-dashes; full header vs. plain list).

Strict but high score: core requirements perfectly met, differences stylistic/minor.
