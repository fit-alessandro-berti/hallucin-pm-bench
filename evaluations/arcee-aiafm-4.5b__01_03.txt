3.5

### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Part (a): Decision Points
- **Core Issues**: The LLM incorrectly identifies and lists several non-decision points (e.g., Assignment of Deck Officer, Prepare-Binding-Offer, Request-Applicant-Confirmation, Finalize-Agreement) as "decision points," which they are not— these are linear steps without conditional branches or gates. It only partially captures the two actual decision points from the ground truth.
  - The "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check" is misrepresented: The LLM folds it into the Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself (Step 3) and the Manual Underwriting-Review (Step 5), but omits the key conditional rule involving *both* risk rating (Low/Medium) *and* requested amount ≤ €250,000. It vaguely says "Risk rated Medium/High" for Step 5, inverting the logic and missing the full rule.
  - The "“TriVote” approval gate" is partially correct (mentions "any two of three approvals pass"), but lacks specificity on the approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) and the exact rule phrasing ("at least two... record 'Approve'"). It also incorrectly states the requirement as "all three" in the prompt's description but then says "any two suffice," but the LLM simplifies without full accuracy.
- **Strictness Impact**: This shows fundamental misunderstanding of what constitutes a "decision point (gate or conditional branch)." Listing extraneous steps bloats the response with irrelevant items, and the incomplete/misstated rules for the actual points indicate poor fidelity to the process description. Significant point loss for inaccuracy and extraneous content.

#### Part (b): Documents List
- **Core Issues**: The list is incomplete and out of order where applicable, missing several explicitly required documents from the process:
  - Misses the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are clear inputs/documents in Step 3's Tri-Color-Risk-Check.
  - Lists "Offer Sheet 77" but omits the "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document in Step 8.
  - Misses "Loan Dossier 2025" from Step 9.
  - Includes "ID Matrix Declaration" correctly, but the overall sequence skips early scorecards, jumping to Deck Memo (Step 5).
  - The added note on "No credit bureau pulls" and "KYC/AML checks are outsourced" is factually aligned with the process note but unnecessary and slightly hallucinatory in phrasing (e.g., it implies credit bureau pulls are absent entirely, which is true but not responsive to the query). No major hallucination of non-existent docs like KYC reports, but the incompleteness is a major flaw.
- **Strictness Impact**: The ground truth emphasizes *all* documents in first-appearance order, including inputs like scorecards. Omitting 4 out of 9 items (scorecards x3, Loan Dossier) is a critical shortfall, warranting heavy deduction. Small errors like not distinguishing signed vs. unsigned Offer Sheet compound this.

#### Overall Score Rationale
- Strengths (partial credit): Captures the two real decision points in spirit, lists some core documents (Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration) correctly, and avoids fabricating non-existent elements.
- Weaknesses: Widespread inaccuracies in identification, incomplete rules, extraneous listings, and major omissions in the document list. Under strict evaluation, this is a low-fidelity response with multiple small-to-medium errors that cascade into significant deviations from the ground truth. A score around 3.5 reflects ~35-40% alignment, penalizing incompleteness harshly.
