**9.2**

The LLM answer fully identifies and ranks the correct three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes both metrics verbatim from the table, avoids all prohibited content, and stays under 150 words (~105 words). Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting times (e.g., portal for docs delays, real-time for batching, routing for queues), and reference a ≥20% cut (projected collectively, implying per activity).

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Stylistic/format differences from GT (memo headers/intro/closing absent in GT; numbered list vs #1 style).
- Time phrasing (e.g., "Avg 36.5h (95p 120.0h)" vs GT's "avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h" – casing, "95p" vs "p95", decimal/kept .0).
- Actions differ entirely (creative element, but GT specifies per-action % with invented "data" like pilots; LLM generalizes projection, no per-item %).
- Slightly less "data-driven" phrasing (no pilots/estimates cited, though logical/uninvented).

Strict but high: core correctness perfect per scoring notes; differences mostly cosmetic/creative.
