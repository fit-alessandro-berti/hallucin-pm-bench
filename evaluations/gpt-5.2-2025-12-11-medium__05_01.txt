**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Major flaw (attachment point)**: LLM attaches timer to `Task_RequestDocs` (late in process, only covers "missing" branch; risks SLA violation if branch starts post-submission delay). Ground truth uses `Task_Receive` (earlier, closer to submission). This core difference invalidates the suggestion's fidelity (-4.0 points).
- **Technical inaccuracies**: LLM implies absolute timing ("48 hours after submitted, using Start_Claim timestamp") requiring unmentioned data/variable setup; adds unneeded "escalated=true" flag/data (GT omits, simple bypass suffices). No timer ID or XML snippet (-1.5).
- **Minor mismatches**: References `f6` (irrelevant); assumes "waiting indefinitely" not in GT. Structure similar (interrupting timer + flow to `Task_Triage`), but extras diverge (-1.5).
- **Strengths**: Correct BPMN type (interrupting boundary timer, PT48H), no new tasks, concise English (~75 words), addresses SLA conceptually (+1.0).

Total strict deduction leaves low score; not identical or equivalent.
