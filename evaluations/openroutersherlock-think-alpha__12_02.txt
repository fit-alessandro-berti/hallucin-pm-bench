The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false with "No" and provides a solid justification citing relevant cases and lines, mirroring the ground truth's core counterexamples (C003 and C005). It accurately notes the absence of Receive_Order before Validate_Payment in both cases, disproving the "always" claim. Minor deductions for slight phrasing differences—e.g., emphasizing precedence over Cancel_Order in C005 rather than explicitly stating "never contains Receive_Order at all," and including extraneous details about compliant cases (C001, C002, C004), which add length without enhancing the core argument—result in a small loss under strict evaluation, though no factual errors are present.
