7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h 95th; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h), quotes the times verbatim, stays within 150 words (149), and avoids any discussion of service times, throughput, or other activities—matching the ground truth on core correctness and no unwarranted content.

However, under strict evaluation, significant point deductions apply for differences from the ground truth:
- **Actions**: Completely different recommendations (e.g., LLM proposes SMS/email automation, system integration, and AI tools; ground truth specifies automated reminders with pilots, e-signature replacement with estimates, and rules-engine pre-classification). While both are concrete and promise ≥20% reductions, the LLM's lack explicit "data-driven" elements like pilot tests or quantified estimates, making them less aligned (major deviation, -2.0 points).
- **Format/Structure**: LLM uses a full executive memo header (To/From/Date/Subject) and narrative wrap-up, expanding to 149 words, whereas ground truth is a concise, bullet-style list without headers or extras (minor bloat, -0.5 points).

Overall, it fulfills the prompt's requirements effectively but diverges notably in action specificity and brevity, preventing a perfect score.
