9.5

The LLM answer fulfills the essential requirements of the prompt: it accurately identifies both parallel task sets, numbers them in order, uses the correct task names, and provides no excess information about Processes A or C.

The only very minor imperfection is the lack of explicit labeling of the sets as "first parallel block" or "second parallel block" (as in the ground truth), and somewhat less visual clarity (no bolding or code formatting), though this is stylistic rather than semantic.

Given the focus is on strictness and close adherence to the ground truth, this minor formatting/detail difference justifies a slight deduction. Otherwise, the answer is factually complete and precise.

Final score: 9.5
