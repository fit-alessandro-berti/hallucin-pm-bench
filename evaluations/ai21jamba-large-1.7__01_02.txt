3.5

### Evaluation Explanation
- **Decision Points Section (Major Errors, ~60% of the response weight)**: The ground truth strictly identifies only three true decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval), focusing on branching logic where choices/escalations occur. The LLM answer incorrectly expands this into a full process summary, labeling non-decision steps (e.g., Quick KYC Verification, Community Impact Assessment, Dual Underwriter Split, Neighbourhood Feedback Check, Disburse Funds) as "decision points." This introduces extraneous content, violates the "summarise the decision points" instruction by bloating the list, and ignores the prompt's emphasis on exact activity names without adding interpretive steps. The correct points are included but diluted and misrepresented in sequence/context. Significant point loss for misinterpretation and lack of conciseness.
  
- **Required Documents Section (Minor Errors, ~30% of the response weight)**: The list is complete and matches the ground truth in all items. However, small wording deviations reduce accuracy: "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "(e.g., single pay-stub or tax slip)" adds "e.g., single" not in ground truth (though prompt-supported, ground truth simplifies); " (CIS) template" includes "template" omitted in ground truth. No extra or missing docs, but these strict mismatches deduct points. The extra closing sentence in LLM ("This structure ensures...") is irrelevant and introduces unrequested commentary.

- **Overall Structure and Adherence (10% weight)**: LLM uses bolding and sub-bullets effectively but fails the prompt's "use exactly the activity names" by framing non-decisions. No standard loan terminology introduced, which is positive. Ground truth's format (e.g., italicized conditions, parenthetical note on exclusions) is more precise and prompt-aligned; LLM's is overly verbose.

This strict scoring reflects substantial deviation in the core "decision points" summary (hallmark of the task), with documents nearly salvaging a passing grade but not enough to offset.
