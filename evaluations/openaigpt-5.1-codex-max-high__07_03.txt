The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (3), the removed task (1), and gateway changes (2) with exact IDs, names, types, and change descriptions matching the ground truth content and order. No extra or missing changes, no commentary.  

However, strict deductions for formatting differences:  
- Missing leading "- " bullets/dashes before all 6 items (present in ground truth).  
- Extra empty lines (double newlines) after each heading (3 instances).  
- No column alignment in gateway changes (ground truth aligns "exclusive → parallel" with extra spaces on second line).  

These are small but consistent textual mismatches, warranting significant point loss per evaluation criteria (perfect content: 10; deduct 2.0 total for format).
