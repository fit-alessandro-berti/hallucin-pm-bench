6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities and metrics)**: Fully accurate. The three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability) are correctly identified and ranked. Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table (e.g., 36.5h/120.0h). No extraneous activities, service times, or throughput metrics are mentioned. (+3.0 points)
- **Format and Structure**: The response is a crisp memo under 150 words (~100 words), addressed appropriately to the COO. It ranks clearly (#1–#3) and focuses solely on waiting times. However, it deviates from the ground truth's ultra-concise, bullet-style structure by adding a formal header and introductory phrasing, which, while professional, introduces minor unnecessary fluff not in the ground truth. (-0.5 points)
- **Recommendations**: Each action is concrete and logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for delays), and the overall claim of ≥20% reduction is stated. However, the actions are not sufficiently "data-driven" as required by the prompt and exemplified in the ground truth (e.g., no references to pilots, tests, estimates, or specific data backing the ≥20% cut per action—instead, generic suggestions with a blanket claim at the end). This is a significant shortfall, as the ground truth provides evidence-based specifics (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%"). Actions feel speculative rather than data-supported, leading to major divergence. (-2.0 points)
- **Overall Strictness**: No criminal/irrelevant content, but the lack of data-driven depth in recommendations creates substantial differences from the ground truth, warranting a mid-tier score despite factual accuracy. Small formatting variances compound the loss.
