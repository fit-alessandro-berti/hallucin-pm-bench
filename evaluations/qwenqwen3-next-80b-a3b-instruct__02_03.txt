9.5

- The LLM Answer is almost identical to the ground truth answer. 
- Minor flaw: The LLM answer did not precisely match the ground truth formatting, omitting some underscores in "Pack_Items". 
- Otherwise, all answers are correct and concise. As per the instruction to be extremely strict, the lack of the underscore in "Pack_Items" (answer 2) merits a small penalty.
