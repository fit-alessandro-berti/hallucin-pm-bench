The LLM answer correctly identifies that the statement is false and cites case-id C003, explaining that *Validate_Payment* occurs before *Receive_Order*, which is a valid counterexample. However, it does not mention the more egregious example: case C005, which contains *Validate_Payment* but does not contain *Receive_Order* at all. Citing all pertinent counterexamples—as shown in the ground truth—demonstrates thorough analysis.

Additionally, the LLM answer could be clearer by explicitly referencing the relevant line numbers, as in the ground truth. The brevity (only mentioning one case) and incompleteness (missing C005) warrant a significant point deduction per instructions to grade strictly. However, the LLM answer does answer correctly and gives some justification that is precise and relevant, so it is not a failing answer.
