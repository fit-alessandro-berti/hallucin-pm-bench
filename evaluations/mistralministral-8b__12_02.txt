The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a valid counter-example with case C003, where Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order, which disproves the "always follows" claim. However, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits the significant counter-example in case C005 (Validate_Payment without any Receive_Order), fails to cite specific line numbers (e.g., lines 6 and 7 for C003, line 11 for C005), and does not explicitly address the "always" aspect with multiple instances as in the ground truth. The justification is concise but lacks the full evidentiary detail and structure of the gold-standard response, reflecting partial alignment under strict evaluation.
