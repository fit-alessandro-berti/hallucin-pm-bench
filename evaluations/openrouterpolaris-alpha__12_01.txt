The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and fully aligned with the ground truth in verdict, structure, and evidence. It correctly identifies the inaccuracy across all three cases, cites relevant cases/activities/timestamps (adding precision via timestamps where ground truth uses line numbers), addresses the "always" and "immediately before" aspects without errors or omissions, and provides a short, data-driven justification as prompted. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., phrasing, bolding, explicit concluding sentence) do not constitute errors and do not warrant deduction under strict evaluation.
