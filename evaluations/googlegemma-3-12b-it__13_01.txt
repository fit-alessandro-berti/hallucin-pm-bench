9.2

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Exact match in substance (correct count of 1), but slightly verbose phrasing compared to the concise ground truth ("1 occurrence"). Minor deduction for not being as succinct.
- **Question 2**: Near-perfect match, including accurate calculation and rounding to 5.56%. The added explanatory steps are helpful but not in ground truth; no significant loss.
- **Question 3**: Correct identification of A1002, but phrasing omits "only" and bolding/formatting from ground truth, making it slightly less precise (prompt allows plural "identifier(s)", but ground truth emphasizes singularity explicitly). Small deduction for incomplete emphasis.
- **Question 4**: Selects two valid reasons (small sample size and temporal bias/"Time Bias") that align directly with ground truth options. Explanations are clear and derived from the log (e.g., 18 events, single day), but lack the deeper specifics in ground truth examples (e.g., variance calculation or Â±5.56 pp.). Minor deduction for somewhat shallower detail, though still accurate and non-inferential.

Overall, the response is highly faithful with no hallucinations or unjustified inferences, sticking strictly to the log data. Strict scoring penalizes minor phrasing and depth differences, but it remains excellent.
