8.0

- The LLM answer correctly identifies that the trace is **not compliant** and gives an accurate, concise explanation for each rule—matching the ground truth on the key points.
- The LLM at first glance mistakenly writes “Violated” for Rule 1, but then immediately clarifies by saying the rule is, in fact, “Satisfied” and gives the correct explanation in parentheses. This error in editing/formatting should result in a deduction: it's ambiguous for a reader skimming answers.
- The justification is otherwise correct and clear for Rules 2, 3, and 4, closely matching the reasoning in the ground truth with no substantive mistakes.
- The format differs from the tabular style of the gold standard, but this is not a content issue.
- Minor deduction for the brief initial confusion under Rule 1—it demonstrates a momentary lack of precision deserving of a significant, but not severe, penalty given the requirement for utmost strictness.
