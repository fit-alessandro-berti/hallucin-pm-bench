8.0

The LLM answer accurately identifies and ranks the three worst-performing activities by waiting time, quoting both their average and 95th-percentile waiting times, with no extraneous mention of other activities or non-waiting metrics. The concrete, data-driven actions per activity are also relevant and plausibly promise ≥ 20% reduction, matching the requirements closely.

However, there are a few minor deviations that should be penalized under strict grading:
- The LLM answer uses slightly different wording for waiting time statistics (e.g., "Avg wait" instead of "avg", "95th" instead of "p95" or "95th-percentile"), which is a small but concrete divergence from the ground truth's requirement to quote numbers "verbatim."
- The recommendations are not strictly phrased as pilots or with "estimated" reductions, but as targets or prescriptive actions; while logical, they lack the explicit empirical phrasing of the ground truth.
- The mention of "target 95th ≤96 h" and similar statements in action recommendations, while a reasonable interpretation, slightly depart from the ground truth’s way of expressing targeted improvement.

These small but clear differences, per your strict criteria, warrant a deduction. Otherwise, the core logic and all major requirements are met.
