7.2

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, numbers)**: Perfect match to table and prompt (9.0/10). All three activities correctly identified and ranked by average waiting time; both avg and 95th-percentile times quoted accurately (minor formatting differences like "Avg wait" vs. "avg" or "95th" vs. "p95" are negligible here, but strictness deducts slightly for non-verbatim phrasing).
- **Structure and constraints**: Strong adherence—crisp, under 150 words (~80 words), no discussion of service-time/throughput/other activities (10/10). Added title is a minor extraneous element not in ground truth, but not violating rules (slight deduction).
- **Action relevance and requirements**: Logically tied to waiting times, concrete, and each promises ≥20% cut via calculated targets (e.g., 120h to ≤96h is precisely 20%). Data-driven via logical inference/percentages, no unsupported inventions (8.0/10). However, actions differ substantially from ground truth (#1 thematically similar but details vary; #2 automation-focused but not e-signature/batch printing; #3 priority queue vs. pre-classification rules—major content divergence, costing points under strict difference-based grading).
- **Overall fidelity to ground truth**: High similarity in core elements, but action variations and minor phrasing/format tweaks prevent a top score (composite: 7.2/10).
