10.0

The LLM answer is an excellent match to the ground truth, with no substantive errors, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. It directly derives all responses from the provided log lines.

- Question 1: Exact match ("1" vs. "1 occurrence").
- Question 2: Identical calculation and result (5.56%).
- Question 3: Functionally equivalent phrasing; both correctly identify A1002 as the sole case without extras.
- Question 4: Provides two clear, sampling-related reasons that align precisely with two of the ground truth options ("Small sample size" and "Temporal bias"), without deviation or addition of ungrounded details.
