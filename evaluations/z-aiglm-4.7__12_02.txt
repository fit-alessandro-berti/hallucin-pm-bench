The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides a precise, one-paragraph justification citing the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11 with no preceding Receive_Order), fully disproving the "always follows" claim with no factual errors. Minor deductions for: (1) slightly less emphatic phrasing (e.g., "without any preceding... in that trace" vs. ground truth's "never contains... at all"); (2) single sentence structure without bullets or introductory "The claim is false because there are clear counter-examples"; (3) lacking the explicit concluding proof sentence; (4) plain "No." vs. bolded "**No**". These are small stylistic/content density differences under utmost strictness.
