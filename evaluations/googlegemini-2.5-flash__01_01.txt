### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortcoming, ~60% of Deduction)**: The ground truth identifies **three explicit decision points** with detailed branching logic (eligibility validation in Step 2, amount threshold post-Step 3, and final approval/rejection in Steps 3/4). The LLM answer only summarizes **one** (the amount threshold), omitting the eligibility check (which inherently decides continuation vs. rejection) and the approval/rejection at pre-approval/auditor stages (critical per constraints, as processes can end without payment). This incompleteness violates the prompt's requirement to "summarise **every** decision point," resulting in a severe loss of points. The LLM's description of the single point is partially accurate (correctly notes progression after PreApprove) but lacks the ground truth's precision on outcomes like rejection paths.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Strengths, ~20% Credit)**: The list matches the ground truth's catalogue exactly (all 7 items, no introductions of undefined artefacts). The LLM correctly qualifiers AuditTrail as "required for Senior_Auditor_Review" (aligning with the ground truth's "only for claims > â‚¬1 000, but still part of the catalogue"). No errors here, but the section is presented less structured than the ground truth's numbered list with caveats.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor Deduction, ~20%)**: The response is concise and avoids introducing non-defined elements (e.g., no legacy activities), adhering to the prompt. However, it lacks the ground truth's tabular format, comprehensive branching logic, and explicit note on process completeness, making it less thorough. Small phrasing issues (e.g., "directly proceeds" assumes no rejection paths) compound the incompleteness.

This strict assessment penalizes the critical omission of 2/3 decision points heavily, as even partial coverage of "every" implies exhaustiveness; minor alignments prevent a floor score.
