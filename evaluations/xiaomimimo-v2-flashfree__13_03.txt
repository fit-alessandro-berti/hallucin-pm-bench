**4.2**

### Rationale (strict evaluation):
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Exact match ("Once" ≡ "1"). +5.0/5.0.
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Major deviations/losses (-4.8/5.0):
  | Issue | Impact | Points Lost |
  |-------|--------|-------------|
  | Misses core ground-truth points: sample stats (14 events/3 cases/<2h), frequency swing (0-7%), wide CI, rare-event sampling error, need for larger/random sample. | Fundamental omission of quantitative reasoning on small-sample bias. | -1.5 |
  | Adds speculation (backlogs/policy changes/merging in full log/manual Send Offer)—violates "no speculation" rule. Misreads data (1001 not manual; only 1/3 cases manual, not 2/3). | Introduces unsupported claims, conflates "manual work" w/ "manual fraud checks." | -1.8 |
  | Partial overlap: Mentions small temporal scope, string variants (but inaccurately—variants are automatic, not manual; no fuzzy over-inclusion warning). Word count OK (98). | Weak credit for partial theme match. | +0.5 |
  
Holistic: Factually imprecise, speculative, misses statistical insight. Small errors (e.g., case count) compound to major gap.
