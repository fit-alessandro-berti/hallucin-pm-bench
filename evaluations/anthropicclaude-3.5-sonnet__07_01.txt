8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), with no speculation or extraneous details, aligning with the prompt's requirements. However, under strict evaluation against the ground truth:

- Task listings reverse the order (id first, then name in parentheses) compared to ground truth (name first, then "id = `id`" format), a formatting inconsistency that deducts points for not matching presentation.
- Gateway change lacks bolding on gateway types, version specifiers "(v1)" and "(v2)", and uses quotes instead of backticks for the ID.
- Introductory sentence ("Here are the factual differences...") is unnecessary and deviates from ground truth's direct start with headings.
- Bullet styles differ slightly (• and - vs. **headings** and *), though the prompt specifies • for headings, which the LLM follows.

These are small but noticeable differences in structure and styling, warranting a deduction despite perfect factual accuracy. No categories are incorrectly marked as "(none)" since all have items, and no other differences (e.g., flows) are reported, which is correct.
