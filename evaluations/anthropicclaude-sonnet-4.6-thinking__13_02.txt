**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth: exact counts (1), percentages (2.08%, 8.33% with correct calculations and two-decimal rounding), and explanation (≤100 words at ~92; covers single occurrence, statistical unreliability/instability via overfitting/noise/rarity, and explicit caution on over-generalization to full population). No errors, inventions, or omissions; format enhances clarity without deviation.
