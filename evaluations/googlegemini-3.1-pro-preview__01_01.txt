### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Decision Points (major discrepancies, ~50% of prompt weight)**: Ground truth identifies **3 explicit decision points** (#1: Triage eligibility validation with reject/continue; #2: amount threshold branch; #3: final approval at PreApprove/Auditor with approve/reject). LLM identifies **only 1** (matching #2 accurately in detail and paths), explicitly claims "exactly **one** formal routing decision point" (direct contradiction), and omits #1 and #3 entirely (no mention of triage eligibility decision or approval/rejection at PreApprove/Auditor). No table format; uses singular heading and paths. **Severe incompleteness and factual error → 2.0/10**.
- **Required Documents (minor differences, ~50% of prompt weight)**: Lists all **7 identical documents** in same order/sequence, with equivalent notes on high-value (AuditTrail) and no legacy steps. Phrasing nearly identical (e.g., "only for high-value" implied vs. explicit). **Near-perfect → 9.5/10**.
- **Overall Structure/Compliance**: Follows prompt (no extras introduced); adds interpretive phrasing ("formal routing") not in GT/process (minor deduction). Notes match intent.
- **Strict Scoring**: Weighted average adjusted down for omissions/contradiction (not "every decision point"); small format/phrasing diffs penalized heavily per instructions. Total reflects ~40% match on core decisions despite docs perfection.
