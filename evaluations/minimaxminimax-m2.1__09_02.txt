The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in reasoning, structure (one concise sentence), and key phrasing ("no timestamps or duration data/information", "only ... occurrence/event counts", focus on absence of start-completion timing data). Minor wording variations ("cannot be calculated" vs. "impossible to compute"; "were released" vs. "are provided"; explicit "interval between ... start and completion events" vs. "start-to-completion intervals") are stylistic synonyms with no impact on accuracy, conciseness, or completeness.
