9.0

**Assessment:**

**a) Decision Points**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies both decision points: (1) the conditional branch after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check, specifying both conditions ("Low or Medium" and "€250,000 or less"), and (2) the TriVote approval gate, correctly noting that two out of three approvals are required. Language is nearly identical in meaning and accuracy to the ground truth.

**b) Required Documents**
- The document list is in correct order and complete, with no extraneous additions, matching the ground truth exactly.

**Minor Issues Noted:**  
- The LLM uses "process advances only if..." for TriVote, which is slightly less explicit than "loan may advance only when at least two of three approvers record 'Approve.'"  
- The LLM answer does not mention "bypass" language—you could argue the word "skip" is a slightly less precise synonym than "bypass," but this is a negligible difference and does not result in incorrect meaning.
- LLM does not reiterate that no KYC/AML/credit-bureau documents are present, but this is not required since that was a negative requirement.

**Strictness Justification:**  
Even these near-synonymous wordings (e.g., "skip" vs "bypass", "process advances only if" vs "loan may advance only when...") are not quite as precise as the exact rule language, which—given your strictness instruction—prevents a perfect 10.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is accurate and faithful with only extremely minor, wording-related differences. 9.0 is justified under strict grading.
