### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth, correctly identifying the two decision points and their rules, as well as listing all documents in the exact first-appearance order without hallucinations (e.g., no improper mentions of KYC/AML). However, under utmost strictness, minor deductions are warranted for small phrasing differences: (1) the first decision point omits explicit mention of the "otherwise proceeds" branch, making it slightly less comprehensive than the ground truth's single-sentence rule; (2) the TriVote description uses "approvals are obtained" instead of precisely mirroring "record 'Approve'" from the process; and (3) naming conventions differ slightly (e.g., "Post-Tri-Color..." vs. "Risk-based skip..."), which subtly deviates from the ground truth's structure without fully capturing the intent. These are small errors but result in a significant point loss per instructions, preventing a perfect score.
