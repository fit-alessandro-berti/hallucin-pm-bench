2.0

The LLM answer has substantial discrepancies and errors relative to the ground truth, failing strict adherence to both the vocabulary policy and process details:

- Most critically, **it invents multiple unauthorized activities** (“Approval Escalation (>70)” and “Approval Escalation (≤70)”, “Payment Scheduling”, “Notification”) that are not present or named in the ground truth. This violates the instruction to not rename, merge, or add activities.
- **The LLM fails to use the required activity names faithfully:** “Compliance Officer Approval” is replaced with ambiguous “Approval Escalation”, and “Release Funds” is split into multiple steps.
- The marking of RACI assignments is inconsistent and inaccurate:
  - Does not use “R, A” together even when roles are both, nor the “–” for uninvolved roles.
  - Assigns “C” and “I” to almost every role in nearly every row, which is not supported by the process narrative or ground truth.
  - Fails to correctly distinguish when Treasury Ops, Compliance Officer, or Analyst are “R” or “A”, compared to the ground truth.
- **Redundant or invented activities** (eg. “Notification”, “Payment Scheduling”) are not justified or mapped from the process, and pollute the matrix.
- No unauthorized synonyms leak into the final output, but the creation and unpermitted naming of activities overshadows this.

Due to the scope and seriousness of misalignments—especially the unauthorized activity structure, which greatly undermines process governance discipline—a very strict penalty is required. This is a failing answer: 2.0.
