3.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly adheres to the strict vocabulary policy by using only the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without any synonyms or leaks from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment" or "risk rating"). This earns partial credit. However, it fails significantly in other areas, leading to a low score under strict criteria:

- **Added and incorrect activities (major deduction, -4.0 points)**: The prompt instructs to cover *every activity* described without renaming, merging, or *adding* activities. The LLM adds unauthorized activities (e.g., "Approval Escalation (â‰¤70)", "Approval Escalation (>70)", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Notification") and splits escalation into two invalid variants. This merges/splits narrative elements (e.g., escalation, scheduling, release, notification) incorrectly, deviating from the ground truth's precise activities ("Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"). Small errors in activity fidelity compound to show poor process mapping.

- **Inaccurate RACI assignments (major deduction, -2.0 points)**: Assignments do not align with the narrative or ground truth. Examples:
  - Intake Vetting: LLM assigns R to Front-Office Analyst (partial match) but incorrectly adds C to Compliance Analyst (narrative shows Front-Office handles it alone initially).
  - KYC Review/AML Screening/Risk Scoring: LLM assigns R to Compliance Analyst and C to Officer (oversimplifies; ground truth differentiates, e.g., A for Officer in Risk Scoring).
  - New activities like Approval Escalation: Wrong roles (e.g., A to Analyst instead of Officer; no distinction for low-risk path).
  - Payment-related: LLM overloads Treasury Ops with R for multiple added activities, ignoring ground truth's C consultations and combined "Release Funds".
  Even minor mismatches (e.g., excessive I assignments) reflect sloppy interpretation.

- **Formatting and completeness (minor deduction, -1.0 points)**: Markdown table is basic but lacks ground truth's bolding for clarity (e.g., **R, A**) and uses dashes inconsistently (LLM uses none). Does not fully cover roles/activities without bloat.

Overall, while vocabulary compliance prevents a 1.0, the structural deviations and errors make this ~70% mismatched, warranting a low score. A perfect match would require exact activity naming/assignment fidelity.
