The LLM answer is accurate, complete, and closely aligns with the ground truth in content, sequence, and reasoning. It correctly identifies the possibility (Q1: yes) and provides an identical minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5). The explanation is concise, valid, and within the word limit, emphasizing T3's unfired status without errors. Minor stylistic differences (narrative vs. marking lists) do not detract from correctness.
