9.0

The LLM answer is correct in substance and provides a valid minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) that matches the ground truth, both in order and logic. The explanation is clear and the reasoning is sound, accurately describing the token flow and why T5 can fire before T3.

**Minor issues for point deductions:**
- The answer misses specifying the intermediate markings as explicitly and precisely as the ground truth does, e.g., not writing M₁ = {P1, P2}, etc.
- The explanation for Q2 could clarify that after T5, T3 becomes disabled since P2 is now empty (this step is emphasized in the ground truth).
- A slightly different phrasing ("T3 never fires - it remains enabled but unfired") might cause a shade of ambiguity; T3 is not actually enabled once P2 is gone.

These are small errors, as requested by the strictness criteria, so the answer is nearly perfect, but not as precise and explicit as the ground truth—hence 9.0.
