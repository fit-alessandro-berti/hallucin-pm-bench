9.0

### Evaluation Notes:
- **Correctness of Answer**: The LLM correctly answers "No", matching the ground truth. It accurately identifies the counterexamples (C002 and C004) and confirms the pattern holds in C001 and C003, directly addressing why the "always" claim fails.
- **Justification Quality**: The explanation cites relevant CaseIDs and sequences as required. Sequences are factually accurate (e.g., C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment; C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment). It effectively highlights violations, similar to the ground truth's case-by-case analysis.
- **Differences from Ground Truth**: 
  - Structure: LLM uses bullet points with ✅/❌ for clarity, while ground truth uses a table—both effective, no major deduction.
  - Completeness: Covers all four cases explicitly, like the ground truth.
  - Minor Phrasing Error: In C002, "Receives a payment check after packing" is imprecise (should clearly state "Validate_Payment after Pack_Items" without implying a new "receive" action). This is a small inaccuracy, warranting a deduction under strict criteria (e.g., -1.0 point). No other errors.
- **Strictness Applied**: High fidelity overall (95% alignment), but the phrasing flaw reflects a significant loss for precision in a meticulous analysis task.
