### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials with Schedule_Machines, and Quality_Check with Create_Documentation), matching the ground truth content and rationale. However, under strict evaluation, it fails on multiple precise requirements:

- **Alphabetical order within pairs (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: The first pair ("Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines") is correctly ordered (P before S). The second pair ("Quality_Check — Create_Documentation") is reversed; it should be "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" (C before Q). This directly violates the instruction for intra-pair sorting.

- **Alphabetical order in overall list (major deduction: -1.5 points)**: Due to the reversed second pair, the list starts with "P" (Procure_Materials) then "Q" (Quality_Check), but correctly it should start with "C" (Create_Documentation) followed by "P". This makes the list unsorted by the first task in each pair.

- **Output format (moderate deduction: -1.0 point)**: The instruction specifies "one pair per line, using the format `Task_X  —  Task_Y`" with no additional numbering or prefixes. The LLM adds "1." and "2.", altering the exact format. Minor alignment differences (e.g., spacing) are overlooked, but the numbering is a clear deviation.

No other pairs are invented or omitted, and Process A is ignored as required. The core identification is accurate (70% alignment), but formatting/ordering errors prevent higher scores, reflecting the strictness for even small instructional violations.
