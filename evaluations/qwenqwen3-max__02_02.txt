The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content across all questions: Q1 correctly identifies 3 distinct cases; Q2 provides the precise sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"; Q3 lists the two distinct preceding activities ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") alphabetically, one per line, with no extras, omissions, or errors. Explanatory text in the LLM answer is supplementary and does not introduce inaccuracies or hallucinations.
