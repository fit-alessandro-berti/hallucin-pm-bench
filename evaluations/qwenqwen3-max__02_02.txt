The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, sequence, and ordering for all questions. Q1 is identical. Q2 is identical in wording and structure (minor escaping in ground truth is a presentation artifact, not a content error). Q3 lists the correct distinct activities alphabetically, one per line as prompted, with no additions, omissions, or hallucinationsâ€”formatting aligns with the instruction despite ground truth's HTML bullets. No penalties apply.
