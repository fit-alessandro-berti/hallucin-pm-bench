**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on both questions. Q1 claims "No," directly contradicting the ground truth "Yes." The explanation for Q2 misinterprets the net structure: P4 (and thus P5) can be reached via T1→T2→T7→T4 without firing T3, leaving P2 available for T5 (as shown in ground truth sequence). LLM falsely assumes T3 is required for P5 and invents a "structural conflict" preventing T5 before T3. No partial credit for format; core answer and reasoning are entirely wrong, warranting minimum score under strict evaluation.
