**1.0**  
The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: wrong overall verdict (Yes vs. No), misreads trace by claiming NA absent (it occurs after QE/before RA, violating Rule 3), and falsely states CC "not invoked" (it is last). Rule 3 assessment inverted; Rule 4 wrong. Zero credit for accuracy despite partial Rule 1/2.
