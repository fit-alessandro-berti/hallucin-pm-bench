4.0

Rationale:
- R1: Correctly marked Compliant, with correct justification.
- R2: Marked Compliant, but this is incorrect. The LLM failed to recognize that the "last required approval" after the Change_Request is the second Manager_Approval on 07-Mar, but Ship_Goods occurred 05-Mar, so this should be **Violated**. This is a major error.
- R3: Incorrectly marked Compliant. Pay_Invoice occurred 06-Mar, Receive_Goods occurred after that, 07-Mar. Should be **Violated**. Major error.
- R4: Correct, Not Applicable with correct justification.
- R5: Correctly identified as Violated, and correct justification (but could have been more explicit about Pay_Invoice too).
- R6: Correct, Compliant.

Summary: The LLM answer made two critical errors by missing violations of R2 and R3 and gave an incorrect overall count of violated rules (two missed). Despite the correct overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion, the analysis is seriously flawed and would mislead an auditor on the true reasons. The LLM did offer rational justifications, but material misunderstandings of event sequencing and approval rules reflect substantial loss of points.
