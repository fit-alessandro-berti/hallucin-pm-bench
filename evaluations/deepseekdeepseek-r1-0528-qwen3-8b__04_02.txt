### Evaluation Rationale:
- **R1**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, correct reasoning). Full points.
- **R2**: Major error—incorrectly marked Compliant; ground truth is Violated due to timing mismatch after change request resets approval timeline (Ship_Goods on 05-Mar vs. final approval 07-Mar). Significant deduction.
- **R3**: Major error—incorrectly marked Compliant; ground truth is Violated (Pay_Invoice 06-Mar before Receive_Goods 07-Mar). Dates reversed, critical factual mistake. Significant deduction.
- **R4**: Matches ground truth (Not Applicable, correct). Full points.
- **R5**: Partially correct (Violated status matches), but justification incomplete—mentions only Ship_Goods, omits Pay_Invoice occurring before new approval (as in ground truth). Partial deduction for insufficient detail.
- **R6**: Matches ground truth (Compliant, correct). Full points.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by errors in 2/6 rules leading to incomplete violation identification.
- **Format**: Roughly follows prompt (status + short justification), but lacks table structure of ground truth; minor deduction.
- **Strictness Applied**: Two full rule misclassifications (R2, R3) are severe factual errors, warranting ~50% score loss despite partial matches elsewhere. Justifications exceed ideal brevity in places but stay under 20 words.
