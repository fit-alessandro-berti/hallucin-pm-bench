3.0

**Evaluation:**

- **A1 (Q1):**  
  LLM answered: There are 3 distinct cases: "C001", "C002", "C003".  
  **Score:** Correct. (No deductions)

- **A2 (Q2):**  
  LLM answered: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
  Ground truth: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
  **Issues:**  
  - Missing "Arrange_Delivery" step: This is a major factual error, omitting a key activity present in the log for C002.
  - Only three activities listed instead of four.
  **Score:** Major error, severe deduction.

- **A3 (Q3):**  
  LLM answered:  
    1. Check_Stock  
    2. Receive_Order  
  Ground truth:  
    - Arrange_Delivery  
    - Check_Stock  

  **Issues:**  
  - "Receive_Order" never immediately precedes "Ship_Order" for any case.
  - Missing "Arrange_Delivery", which does immediately precede "Ship_Order" for C002.
  - Out of 2 required items, only 1 is correct, and 1 is a hallucination.
  **Score:** Major error, severe deduction.

**Summary:**  
Only Q1 is correct. A2 omits a required step; A3 both fabricates and omits required answers.  
=> (One correct answer; two major errors.)  
Thus, score: **3.0** (only 1/3 correct, with strictness for detail and accuracy per instruction).
