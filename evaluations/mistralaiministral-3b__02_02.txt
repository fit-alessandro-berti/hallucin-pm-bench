4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Perfect match to ground truth (3 distinct cases). Full credit.
- **Q2**: Major error—omits "Arrange_Delivery" entirely, resulting in an incomplete and inaccurate sequence. This is a significant factual omission, treated as a hallucination of the trace. No credit.
- **Q3**: Partial match—correctly identifies "Check_Stock" as one predecessor but fabricates "Receive_Order" (which does not immediately precede "Ship_Order" in any case) and fails to include "Arrange_Delivery." List is neither complete nor alphabetically ordered as required (should be "Arrange_Delivery" first, then "Check_Stock"). Minimal credit for the one accurate item.

Overall score reflects strict penalization for omissions, fabrications, and non-compliance with formatting/instructions, with Q1 providing the only uplift. Total differences from ground truth are substantial across two questions.
