### Evaluation Rationale:
- **XML fragments**: Functionally identical and correct (interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H` routing to existing `Activity_AMReview` via sequence flow). Minor differences in IDs (`Timer_SLA48h` vs `Boundary_LateCreate`), names (`48h SLA` vs `48h breach`), and attribute order are cosmetic and valid BPMN; no deduction beyond trivial. Absence of ground truth's explanatory comments (`<!-- ❶ -->`) is acceptable as not required.
- **Justification**: Major deduction for factual BPMN error—calls it "non-interrupting" despite `cancelActivity="true"` making it *interrupting* (direct contradiction showing imprecise knowledge); contradicts ground truth's correct "interrupting". Wording otherwise similar (references escalation to existing review), but lacks ground truth's precision (e.g., bolded task names, "pre-existing", explicit "without introducing any new activities"). This error alone warrants ~2.5-point loss under strict criteria.
- **Overall compliance**: Fully adheres to task (no new activities, only added elements + 1-sentence justification, enforces SLA correctly using unused path). High marks for solution correctness, tempered by justification flaw.
