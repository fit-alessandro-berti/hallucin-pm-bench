### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies and describes the three core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) using exact terminology, with correct conditions and outcomes matching the ground truth. It also lists all required documents completely and without introducing extraneous terms. However, under strict evaluation:

- **Decision Points (minor deductions: -1.0 total)**: The summary omits precise process flow context, such as the Underwriter Alignment Gate occurring "after the Dual Underwriter Split" and the Amount Threshold Decision following "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check." This reduces precision in summarizing the process sequence. Phrasing differences (e.g., "within the acceptable range (≤ 2 points difference)" vs. ground truth's direct "differ by ≤ 2"; lowercase "approve or reject" vs. capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**") are small but warrant point loss for exactness. The casual introductory phrase ("Okay, here's a summary...") is unnecessary and slightly deviates from a clean, professional summary.
  
- **Required Documents (minor deductions: -0.8 total)**: The list is exhaustive and faithful, but phrasing inconsistencies include "≤ 3 months old" (adds "old" not in ground truth's "≤ 3 months"); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (adds "single" and uses "or" vs. ground truth's concise "pay-stub/tax slip"); and "(CIS) template" (adds "template" not in ground truth's "(CIS)"). The ground truth includes a clarifying note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*") emphasizing the non-standard nature, which the LLM omits, missing an opportunity to fully align with the prompt's intent to avoid standard terminology.

Overall, the answer is highly faithful (core content ~90% match) but loses points for flow omissions and phrasing tweaks, which are significant under utmost strictness despite being minor in isolation. Structure (bullets vs. numbered lists) is functionally equivalent, so no deduction there.
