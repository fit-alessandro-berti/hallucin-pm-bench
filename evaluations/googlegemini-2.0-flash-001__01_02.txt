8.5

The LLM answer is quite strong and aligns closely with the ground truth, but there are a few notable deductions required for strictness:

**Decision Points:**
- It lists all three correct decision points with their proper names.
- However, it omits explicitly referencing the **branching logic** (the conditional pathways within the Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with the precision of "if/else" statements as shown in the ground truth. The LLM answer is accurate but less explicit about process flow and conditionality.
- It does not clarify that the Underwriter Alignment Gate is “after the Dual Underwriter Split” or that the Amount Threshold Decision is “after Neighbourhood Feedback Check” (location in process missing).

**Required Documents:**
- The LLM’s list is complete and uses the correct terminology, matching both the names and conditions.

**Minor Errors:**
- In the required documents, the LLM says “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template,” which is slightly more verbose than “Community Impact Statement (CIS)” but not incorrect.
- In its summary of Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA), the wording “loans with amounts ≥ €15 000” is clear and correct.
- "Single pay-stub or tax slip" is a slight variation from "(pay-stub/tax slip)" but conveys the same meaning.

**Positives:**
- No standard loan terminology was introduced.
- No extra/irrelevant decision points or documents were added.

**Strictness Deductions:**
- Lacks slightly in explicit clarity of the process flow and placement of decision points.
- Does not add clarifying notes such as “No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.”

**Conclusion:**  
Small infidelities to the exact process specifics and lack of process-position descriptors mean this is not a perfect 10.0, but as it is very close and error-free regarding essentials and terminology, a score of **8.5** is warranted.
