6.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s)—core matching ground truth. Quantifies breaches precisely. Uses bullets exclusively for recommendations, which are concrete and data-driven (citing waiting times, cases, inflows). Stays grounded in table data (no absent activities/metrics). ~190 words ≈150 target.
- **Major deductions (significant point loss per strictness)**:
  - No executive memo format/header (To/From/Subject, date/sample ref like "April 2025 sample" or total cases ~4,805)—(-1.5).
  - Intro phrasing/structure differs substantially (no "Analysis of... highlights", no bold consistency, adds unrequested volume emphasis for Credit)—(-1.0).
  - **All three recommendations completely different** from ground truth (e.g., LLM: capacity addition/routing/througput increase; ground: bypass/pre-checks/analyst addition/heuristic with €25k invention)—each mismatch deducts heavily as 1/3 of memo content (-1.5 total).
  - No "**Recommended actions**" subheader or closing projection/impact estimate—(-0.5).
  - Minor: Slight over-wording, inconsistent bolding.

Overall: Core analysis matches (50% credit), but structural/format/recs divergences prevent higher score under "utmost strictness/small errors significant loss."
