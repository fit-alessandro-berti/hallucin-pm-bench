### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortcomings, ~60% of Score Impact)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points inferred from the process (eligibility validation with reject/continue, amount threshold with branch/skip, and approval/rejection before payment with approve/end). The LLM answer only covers one (the amount threshold) and omits the other two entirely, including critical rejection paths (e.g., ineligible claims rejected during triage; approvals failing to end the process without payment). This is a significant omission of "every decision point," as required by the prompt, leading to a severe accuracy deficit. The LLM's summary also incorrectly implies direct progression to payment without approval failures, contradicting the process constraints.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Match, ~30% of Score Impact)**: The list is complete and accurate, matching all seven documents from the ground truth, including associations to activities and the "signed" detail for BankTransferAuthorization (from the description). Minor positives: The table format aids clarity without introducing extras. However, the ground truth qualifies AuditTrail as "only for claims > â‚¬1 000, but still part of the catalogue," which the LLM omits, a small but notable gap under strict criteria.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (Minor Deductions, ~10% of Score Impact)**: The response is well-organized and adheres to the "do not introduce" rule (no extras). However, extras like "Total documents: 7" and "Total decision points: 1" are inaccurate (mismatches ground truth counts) and not requested, introducing minor noise. No legacy activities mentioned.

This score reflects utmost strictness: The incomplete decision points alone warrant a failing grade on that core element, partially offset by perfect documents, but small errors (e.g., missing qualifiers, wrong totals) deduct further.
