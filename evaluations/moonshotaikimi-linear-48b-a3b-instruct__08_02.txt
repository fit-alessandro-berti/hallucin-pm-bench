The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 with accurate reasoning on the alternative path to P5 via T2-T7-T4 without consuming P2, matching the ground truth. For Q2, it provides the exact minimal sequence [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5] and justifies its minimality, aligning closely with the ground truth's demonstration (though without explicit markings M1-M5 or the note on T3 disabling post-T5). Minor deductions for excessive verbosity (exceeds 120-word limit by including redundant simulations and alternatives), lack of structured Q1/Q2 formatting, and absence of marking details, but core content is precise with no factual errors.
