**4.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Part (a): 9.0/10** – Identifies both decision points correctly with accurate rules in one sentence each. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "grant their approval" vs. "record 'Approve.'"; "or" in official list; step labels added) are small but deduct points under strictness. No hallucinations.
- **Part (b): 0.0/10** – Major failures: Omits **three critical documents** (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow), which first appear in Step 3 as bolded **inputs** and are explicitly required per ground truth. Lists only 6/9 items, disrupting order (Deck Memo incorrectly #2 instead of #5). Treats Signed Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration correctly as separate, but incompleteness is disqualifying.
- **Overall: 4.0/10** – Weighted average reflects near-perfect (a) dragged down by catastrophic incompleteness in (b) ("list **all** documents"). Strict policy demands significant deduction for this omission of 33% of items, even if non-bolded "Document:" phrasing misled; ground truth confirms inclusion. No policy violations or extras.
