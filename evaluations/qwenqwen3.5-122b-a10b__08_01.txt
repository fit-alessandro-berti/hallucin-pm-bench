**9.2**

The LLM answer is highly accurate and fully addresses the prompt: correctly states "Yes" with the exact minimal concrete firing sequence ⟨T1, T2, T5⟩ demonstrating T5 firing before T3, and provides a brief, correct justification matching the enabling condition (p3 ≥ 1 ∧ p4 = 0 after T2, since T3 unfired). Markings are correctly described up to T5. No factual errors or invalid sequences.

Minor differences from ground truth (strictly penalized):
- Misses deeper insight ("indeed must fire before T3 if ever"; permanence of disablement post-T3; inhibitor details on p4 never emptied without p3).
- Shorter sequence (stops correctly at T5; ground truth extends to T3/T4 unnecessarily for the question).
- Slightly less precise formatting/markings (no inline post-T5 marking like `p2=1, p6=1`; no full proof-like explanation).
- Phrasing less emphatic ("possible" vs. "can, and indeed must").

These are small omissions of non-essential depth (prompt asks only for "brief" justification if yes), but per strictness, deduct 0.8 total. Perfect match would be 10.0.
