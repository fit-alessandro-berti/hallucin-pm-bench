5.5

The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the requirements and the ground truth, but exhibits several notable errors and deviations that warrant point deductions:

**Vocabulary Adherence:**  
- The LLM uses only the authorized terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) in the activity names, and does not use forbidden synonyms. ✔️  
- However, it introduces additional activities not in the ground truth (“Escalation of High-Risk Cases”, combines “Notification of Payment Release” with “Release of Funds”, etc.) and omits or renames required ones (“Compliance Officer Approval” is split/renamed, “Release Funds” vs. “Release of Funds”/“Notification...”).  
- The individual cell values use only the authorized four RACI terms, not synonyms.

**Process Conformance & Matrix Structure:**  
- Activity names should match the process narrative, but the LLM answer invents activities (“Escalation of High-Risk Cases”, “Notification of Payment Release”) and splits/merges actions not present in the ground truth. Strict policy: activities may not be renamed, merged, added, or omitted. ❌ (-2)
- The correct mapping of RACI roles to activities is not followed. For example:
  - “Intake Vetting” does not mark the Front-Office Analyst as Accountable (“R, A”), only “R”.
  - “KYC Review” and “AML Screening” do not give “R, A” to Compliance Analyst.
  - “Risk Scoring”: Compliance Officer should be Accountable (“A”), not merely “I”.
  - The “Compliance Officer Approval” row is split (“Escalation...”, “Approval...”), and the role assignments and notations differ from the ground truth.
  - “Release Funds” is split into “Release of Funds” and “Notification...”, and assignments do not match.
- The ground truth requires combined “R, A” indications where appropriate; the LLM splits these into R vs. A in each activity, which is not as per instruction. ❌ (-1)
- The dash (“–”) to indicate no involvement is missing; instead, the LLM uses empty cells or fills them incorrectly. ❌ (-0.5)
- Overall, nearly every row contains at least one role assignment that differs from the ground truth.

**Summary (Deduction):**  
- Strictly following the rubric, not merging/adding/splitting activities is crucial. LLM splits and adds to the list (major deduction).
- R, A are split, rather than combined when appropriate; further minor deduction.
- The role assignments are, in most rows, not matching the ground truth (major deduction).
- Dash indicator missing (minor, but required per instructions).

**Conclusion:**  
On a 1.0–10.0 scale under utmost strictness, this answer merits a 5.5  
- Significant process fidelity and vocabulary conformance are observed, but multiple major deviations in activity structure and RACI mapping, plus several minor formatting errors, make it far from a perfect or nearly perfect submission.
