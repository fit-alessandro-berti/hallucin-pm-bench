4.2

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Strong, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses only the four authorized terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without any synonyms or leaks from the narrative (e.g., no "Preliminary Assessment", "CDD", or "risk rating"). This matches the ground truth exactly on terminology.
- **Structure and Format (Partial, +1.0 point)**: Presented as a Markdown table, with clear roles and RACI codes. Includes a helpful key, which isn't in the ground truth but doesn't violate instructions. However, it adds an unnecessary title ("NimbusPay - Wire Transfer Process RACI Matrix"), and uses bolding inconsistently compared to the ground truth.
- **Activities Covered (Major Violation, -3.0 points)**: The prompt strictly forbids adding, renaming, or merging activities, yet the LLM adds four unauthorized ones ("Escalation of High-Risk Cases", "Approval of High-Risk Cases", "Release of Funds", "Notification of Payment Release"). The ground truth adds only two implied ones ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds") to cover "every activity," but the LLM over-expands (e.g., splitting escalation and notification, which aren't explicitly separate activities in the narrative). This is a significant deviation, as the core four should dominate without extras.
- **RACI Assignments (Poor Accuracy, -2.8 points)**: Numerous mismatches even on the shared activities, evaluated cell-by-cell with strictness for small errors:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office Analyst (R vs. ground truth **R,A**; minor but loses distinction of accountability). Compliance Officer (I vs. –; incorrectly implies involvement). Partial match on Compliance Analyst (C) and Treasury Ops (I).
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office Analyst (C vs. –; wrongly consulted). Compliance Analyst (R vs. **R,A**; misses accountability). Compliance Officer (A vs. C; reverses roles). Treasury Ops match (I).
  - **AML Screening**: Similar to KYC—Front-Office Analyst (C vs. –), Compliance Analyst (R vs. **R,A**); Compliance Officer and Treasury Ops match (C, I).
  - **Risk Scoring**: Major errors—Front-Office Analyst (R vs. C; incorrectly responsible). Compliance Analyst (C vs. R; role reversal). Compliance Officer (I vs. **A**; misses accountability). Treasury Ops match (I).
  - For added activities: Even if extras were allowed, they mismatch ground truth (e.g., "Approval" has Treasury Ops as I vs. –; "Release" has Compliance Analyst/ Officer as I vs. C; no ground truth equivalents for "Escalation" or "Notification").
  - Overall: No use of combined **R,A** notation or dashes (–) for no involvement; defaults to I, inflating involvement (e.g., multiple I's where ground truth uses –).
- **Comprehensiveness and Fidelity to Prompt/Narrative (Weak, -1.0 point)**: Covers roles but distorts the process (e.g., assigns Risk Scoring to Front-Office Analyst, contradicting the narrative's Compliance Analyst derivation; adds notification with dual R on Front/Treasury Ops, which is interpretive overreach). Fails to precisely map "every activity" without addition, unlike the ground truth's tighter interpretation.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: With utmost strictness, the additions and ~70% cell-level errors (across 8 activities x 4 roles = 32 cells, ~22 mismatches) warrant a low score. Partial credit for vocabulary and table format prevents a 1.0, but this isn't a faithful reproduction.

Total: Starts at 10.0 baseline, deductions yield 4.2. The answer is functional but violates core constraints, making it substantially divergent from the ground truth.
