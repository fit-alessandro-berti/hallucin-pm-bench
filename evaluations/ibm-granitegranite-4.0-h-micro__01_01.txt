2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in structure, content accuracy, and fidelity to the prompt, warranting a very low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Decision Points Summary (Major Mismatch, -4.0 points deduction)**:  
  The ground truth precisely identifies **3 explicit decision points** via a table focusing on branching logic/outcomes (e.g., eligibility check with eligible/rejected branches; amount threshold post-pre-approval; final approval leading to payment or end). The LLM incorrectly frames **5 process activities** (including non-decisions like Process_Refund_Payment and Issue_Confirmation_Letter) as "decision points" in a table, without describing branching logic (e.g., no mention of rejection outcomes or the exact post-pre-approval threshold check). This inflates and mischaracterizes decisions, ignoring the prompt's focus on "every decision point" with implicit branching from the process description.

- **Required Documents List (Significant Errors, -3.0 points deduction)**:  
  The ground truth provides a **single, complete, numbered list** of **7 documents**, noting conditional use (e.g., AuditTrail only for >â‚¬1,000) and explicitly excluding others/legacy. The LLM scatters documents across its table (repeating references like FlightManifest/WeatherReport unnecessarily), does not consolidate into a complete list, and introduces inaccuracies:  
  - Attributes BankTransferAuthorization to Senior_Auditor_Review ("if payment is to be initiated"), which is undefined and incorrect (it's only for Process_Refund_Payment).  
  - Lists "Senior_Auditor_Review (if applicable)" and "All previously approved documents" as quasi-documents in later steps, blurring artifacts.  
  - Includes extraneous "references" (e.g., prior forms in every row) not required per the process.  
  All documents are mentioned somewhere, but the format and precision fail the prompt's "list all required documents" directive.

- **Overall Adherence and Strictness Adjustments (-1.0 points deduction)**:  
  The LLM adds a verbose summary and table headers/descriptions not in the ground truth, expanding beyond summarization. It correctly avoids undefined activities/artifacts and notes the legacy exclusion, but small errors (e.g., misattribution, lack of branching) compound into major structural flaws. No hallucinations of new elements, but the response is ~70% divergent in organization and detail, justifying minimal credit.
