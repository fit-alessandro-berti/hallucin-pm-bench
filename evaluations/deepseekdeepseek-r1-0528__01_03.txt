7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a)**: Strong match to ground truth in identifying and summarizing the two decision points accurately (risk-based skip and TriVote gate), with rules described concisely in one sentence each. Minor deductions for unnecessary step numbering/references (ground truth omits them for brevity) and a formatting typo in the TriVote rule ("**at least two out** (** (**" â€“ extraneous parentheses and bolding disrupt clarity), which counts as a small error under strict criteria.
- **Part (b)**: Lists all documents correctly in first-appearance order except for omitting "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct entry (ground truth separates it from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" based on process description; LLM notes the signing but fails to include it separately in the numbered list, making the list incomplete at 8 items vs. 9). No hallucinations (correctly excludes KYC/AML), and extra notes are accurate but not required. This omission is a significant error, as it underrepresents the full set of required documents.
- **Overall**: High fidelity (no major deviations or inventions), but strict scoring penalizes the document gap and minor formatting issue heavily, preventing a perfect score.
