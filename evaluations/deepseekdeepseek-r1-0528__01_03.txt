7.2

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision points:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies both key decision points. The rules are clearly articulated but contain very minor weaknesses:
    - In the Step 6 “TriVote” rule, the wording is slightly confusing due to a typo: "at least two out (** (** (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve the application." This is less concise, and the parenthetical syntax is odd—it should simply state "at least two of the three (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve".
    - The answer could also be a bit crisper and avoid unnecessary restatement (e.g., "Proceed to Prepare-Binding-Offer" is not as directly tied to the process step as just stating the approval rule).
    - The answer omits reiteration that all three roles participate in "TriVote," as emphasized in the process description.
    - Nonetheless, no factual errors and core logic is intact.

**b) List of Documents:**
- The LLM lists all but one required document: it omits **"Signed Offer Sheet 77"** as a separate document (combines it with Offer Sheet 77, only mentioning it's “signed” at a later step in a note).
- The "Offer Sheet 77" is correctly included, and the note acknowledges that its signed form is required, but the full, proper identification of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as its own required deliverable (per the process description) is missing from the list (the ground truth explicitly separates steps 7 and 8: “Offer Sheet 77” → “Signed Offer Sheet 77”).
- All other documents and orderings match the ground truth.
- The “Deck Memo” conditionality is accurately noted.
- No hallucinated documents, which is good.

**Penalty Reasoning:**
- A significant error is the omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a required document in the main list; this is an explicit requirement and should be listed in the ordered sequence.
- Minor loss for less precise wording and odd formatting in the "TriVote" rule.
- Clarity and conciseness could be improved slightly, and the list should strictly match the formatted ground truth.

**Summary:**  
Both decision points are found, rules are substantially correct, and most documents are listed in the right order. However, the omission/misclassification of “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is a non-trivial error in a context demanding utmost precision, and the “TriVote” parenthetical is suboptimal.

**Strict score:** 7.2
