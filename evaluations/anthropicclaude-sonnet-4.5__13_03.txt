7.0

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Question 1**: Perfect matchâ€”exact count of 1 is correct and directly from the data. No errors. (Full points)
- **Question 2**: The response is concise (under 120 words) and identifies valid issues like labeling inconsistencies and sampling bias, aligning broadly with ground truth themes (small sample, variant names). However, it introduces speculation (e.g., unmentioned variants like "Manual Fraud Review," clustering in shifts/outages, mid-month rule changes), violating the "no speculation" rule and diverging from ground truth's data-strict, statistical focus (e.g., no emphasis on frequency swings, confidence intervals, or random sampling needs). This reflects significant content differences and loose adherence, warranting a deduction. Ground truth is more precise and analytical without extras.
