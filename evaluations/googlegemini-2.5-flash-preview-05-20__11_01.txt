The LLM answer gets the following points right:
- Identifies and ranks the correct three activities (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability) purely by waiting time, matching the data.
- Quotes the correct average and 95th percentile waiting times for each activity, in almost verbatim wording.
- Proposes concrete, data-driven actions for each activity, plausibly aiming for ≥ 20% reductions.

However, deductions are due to:
- **Automated document request generation for Request_Documents** is reasonable, but the action in the ground truth (customer reminders with 24h escalation) is sharper and directly data-driven. “System integration” is vaguer and lacks an explicit data reference.
- **Send_Closure_Letter**: The suggestion of "automated email trigger" is close to the reference (“same-day e-signature letters generated on claim closure”), but not as precise, and doesn't mention replacing batch printing.
- **Assess_Liability**: “Triage team to pre-sort and allocate by complexity” is logical, yet “rules-engine pre-classification to bypass senior queue for simple cases” is crisper and more automation-driven (less resource-intensive).
- **Lacks explicit evidence or percentage reductions** in the recommendations (e.g., “pilot tests show…” or “estimated 25% decrease”); the reference does this.
- **158 words**: slightly over limits if strict on word count.

**Summary**: The answer is highly functional, accurate in hard data, and on-point regarding activities, but remedies show less specificity and lack explicit quantification or data anchor, and wording is slightly less sharp. Loss of 2 points for these factors.
