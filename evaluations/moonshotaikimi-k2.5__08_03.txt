The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" and the key mechanism (T2b shortcut to enable pd without T3), and provides a valid prefix sequence (T1, T2b, T4, T5) reaching a marking after T5 fires without prior T3. However, under utmost strictness, it has major flaws vs. ground truth:

- **Sequence mismatch**: Provides a 4-step sequence stopping at T5 *without firing T3 at all*, explicitly framing it as "without ever firing T3". Ground truth requires demonstrating T5 *before* T3 (implying T3 fires later via feedback T6→pc→T3), giving a 6-step sequence 〈T1, T2b, T4, T5, T6, T3〉. This misinterprets "before T3" as "without T3" rather than ordering both in a full trace.
- **Shortest claim error**: Asserts 4 steps as "shortest" for the demonstration, ignoring the +2 steps (T6, T3) needed for proper ordering; ground truth proves 6 is minimal for T5 before T3 while acknowledging 4-step lower bound only for T5-enabling.
- **Missing elements**: No mention of feedback loop (T6→pc enabling post-T5 T3); incomplete explanation of why T3 is possible *after* T5. Ground truth details this, markings through T3, and full minimality proof.
- **Minor format/explanation diffs**: Abbreviated markings; alternative sequence order (T1,T4,T2b,T5) not in ground truth; less precise structure (no arrowed markings, no "why this works" section, no final 〈...〉 list).

These are substantive differences (core sequence/demo half-missing, altered intent), not small errors—major point loss despite partial overlap on "yes" + T2b path.
