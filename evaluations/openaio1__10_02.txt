5.0

**Assessment:**

**Positives:**
- The LLM uses the mandated role vocabulary ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison") and "KYC Review" correctly, never defaulting to non-allowed variants.
- Steps/tasks appear in the correct process order and are granularly separated according to the source text.
- Most steps are mapped to the correct roles as Responsible/Accountable (RA) or Consulted/Informed (CI).

**Major Errors:**
- **Missing "Operations Manager" Role:** The ground truth includes “Operations Manager” as a key role with Accountable (A) responsibility for every task, but the LLM omits this role entirely. This is a substantial divergence from the ground truth.
- **Task Wording:** Some task descriptions in the LLM answer are paraphrased or combined ("Release payment & ensure SWIFT transmission" for two steps; "Archive case file & notification"), where the ground truth separates “Release Payment” and “Archive Record”. The wording for activities does not always strictly follow the ground truth or mandated style.
- **R/A Conflation:** The LLM uses "R/A" in several cells, meaning it claims the same person is both Responsible and Accountable, whereas the ground truth is much clearer and distinguishes these roles, especially with Accountable (A) typically mapped to "Operations Manager".
- **Consulted and Informed Gaps:** For several steps, the proper distribution of Consulted and Informed parties does not match the ground truth (for example, omission of Transaction Analyst as C for KYC Review, and IT Support as C for screening and releasing payment).
- **Tracking Notification:** The LLM answer combines "archive" and "notification" as a single task for IT Support, whereas the ground truth separates roles in notification versus archive.
- **Legend:** The LLM reproduces the RACI explanations, but they are not as precise as the ones in the ground truth.

**Minor Errors:**
- "SWIFT transmission" is not mentioned in the ground truth. The LLM chooses this phrase, loosely paraphrasing "IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent."
- The LLM puts dashes ("–") for roles not involved in a task, while the ground truth does not.

**Overall:**
- Missing a whole role, conflation of responsibilities, and lack of strict task and vocabulary fidelity create a substantial gap versus the ground truth.
- The answer is better than a fail, but major process management and compliance faults leave it at 5.0. Tight strictness, as requested, means a lower score for each infraction.
