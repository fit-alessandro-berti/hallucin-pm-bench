3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment with significant point deductions for multiple deviations from the ground truth, as required. The LLM answer attempts a valid structure but diverges substantially in key areas, leading to a low rating despite some alignments.

#### Major Deductions (High Impact, ~4.0 points lost total):
- **Role Columns (Critical Structural Error)**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" column entirely, using only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support. The ground truth explicitly includes Operations Manager as a core role with assignments (e.g., A in most tasks). This omission affects ~80% of RACI assignments, making the table incomplete relative to the ground truth. (-2.5 points)
- **RACI Assignments (Core Content Mismatch)**: Assignments differ in nearly every cell across all tasks, invalidating the functional equivalence of the table:
  - Task 1: LLM (TA: R/A) vs. Ground (TA: R, RL: I, OM: A, ITS: C) – Wrong for all roles.
  - Task 2: LLM (TA: R/A) vs. Ground (TA: R, RL: A, OM: I, ITS: C) – Misses RL A and adds erroneous TA A; ignores OM/ITS.
  - Task 3: Partial match (TA: C, RL: R/A), but ground splits R/A (RL: R, OM: A) and adds ITS: I. LLM's combined R/A on RL deviates.
  - Task 4: LLM (TA: I, RL: R/A) vs. Ground (TA: C, RL: R, OM: A, ITS: I) – TA I vs. C; misses OM A and ITS I.
  - Task 5: LLM combines "Release payment & ensure SWIFT transmission" with TA: R/A, RL: I, ITS: R vs. Ground's singular "Release Payment" (TA: R, RL: I, OM: A, ITS: C). Erroneous TA A and ITS R; ignores OM and SWIFT handling.
  - Task 6: LLM combines "Archive case file & notification" with ITS: R/A, RL: I vs. Ground's "Archive Record" (TA: C, RL: I, OM: A, ITS: R). Adds erroneous ITS A and RL I placement; misses TA C and OM A; notification not explicitly covered.
  Overall, <30% cell-level accuracy, with consistent errors in accountability (A) placement and inclusion of all roles. (-1.5 points)

#### Minor Deductions (Cumulative, ~2.0 points lost total):
- **Task Wording and Coverage**: Phrasings are similar but not identical, introducing small inaccuracies or extras:
  - LLM adds details like "(sender and beneficiary)" in Task 3 (not in ground truth's concise "KYC Review").
  - Task 5 combines release and SWIFT (from informal text) but ground truth separates implicitly, leading to incomplete mapping.
  - Task 6 includes "& notification" explicitly, but ground truth implies it via I assignments without wording it.
  - Minor phrasing diffs: e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Approve high-risk transaction" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions" (singular/plural mismatch). Covers all informal steps but reorganizes (e.g., combining), deviating from ground truth's granularity. (-1.0 point)
- **Formatting and Presentation**:
  - Uses "–" for blanks vs. ground truth's explicit letters or implied empties – minor but inconsistent with ground truth's approach.
  - No bolding on R/A (ground truth bolds them for emphasis).
  - Legend: LLM provides verbose explanations; ground truth uses a simple "Legend" line. Extra bullet points and intro sentence in LLM add unsolicited content.
  - Header: LLM's "Task" vs. ground truth's "Task / Activity (mandated wording)" – misses mandated wording emphasis. (-0.5 point)
  - Post-table Notes: LLM adds a bullet list explaining R/A/C/I (helpful but not in ground truth); ground truth has a separate note on vocabulary adherence, which LLM implies but doesn't state. (-0.5 point)

#### Partial Credits (+1.0 points added from base 1.0):
- Correctly uses all mandated vocabulary: "KYC Review" (Task 3), "Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison". No forbidden terms like CDD or Compliance Officer.
- Produces a valid Markdown table covering all 6 informal steps without omissions.
- Appropriate roles from informal text (IT Support retained); no extraneous inventions beyond mandated.

This results in a low score due to the strict criteria emphasizing fidelity to the ground truth—structural and assignment differences dominate, reflecting significant overall deviation despite basic compliance.
