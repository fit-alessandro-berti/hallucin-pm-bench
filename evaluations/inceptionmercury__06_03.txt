The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two concurrent task sets in the exact order, with precise task names matching the ground truth. It adheres to the prompt by focusing solely on Process B and avoiding extraneous information. Minor deductions for stylistic differences (e.g., introductory sentence, labeling as "Parallel Split #1" instead of "Set 1 – first parallel block," bullet formatting versus inline with ‖ symbol, and absence of the closing statement), but these do not alter the factual accuracy or completeness.
