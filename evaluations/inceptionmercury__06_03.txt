9.5

The LLM answer identifies the two sets of tasks that can execute concurrently in Process B, names them in the correct order, and lists exactly the correct tasks for each set, matching the ground truth. The only small deviation is in format: the LLM uses headings "**Parallel Split #1:**" and "**Parallel Split #2:**" rather than explicitly numbering them as "Set 1" and "Set 2" with the extra clarification included in the ground truth's phrasing. This is a minor stylistic difference and does not alter the substantive correctness, but per instructions, even small errors warrant a loss in points. Therefore, the answer receives a 9.5.
