The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b are exact matches in values (minor formatting differences like spacing before '%' or absence of explicit calculations do not warrant deduction, as the prompt does not require showing work). For question 3, the response is within word limit (89 words), explicitly addresses the single occurrence ("only one instance"), highlights instability/variance ("overfitting to noise," "skewed by this single outlier," "lack sufficient training examples"), and cautions against over-generalization ("generalising is statistically unsound," "non-representative benchmarks," "undermining... accuracy and robustness"). It covers all required elements but uses broader phrasing (e.g., predictive models) rather than the ground truth's specific examples (e.g., cycle time, confidence intervals), which introduces a slight interpretive variance under strict evaluation, justifying a minor deduction from perfection.
