**6.2**

### Rationale:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Perfect match (exact count of 1). +5.0.
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Core idea of small-sample bias captured (+2.0), but major omissions vs. ground truth: no quantification (14 events/3 cases/<2h), no frequency swing example (0%-7%), no confidence interval/rare-event error emphasis, **no mention of near-synonyms** ("Automatic Fraud Check"/"Fraud Check (Automatic)") causing string-matching distortion—a key reason for misestimation of *manual* specifically (+1.2 total). Underdeveloped; word count compliant but lacks precision/depth. Significant losses for incompleteness. 

Strict deduction applied per instructions.
