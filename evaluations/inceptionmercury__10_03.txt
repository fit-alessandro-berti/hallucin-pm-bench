3.5

The answer has several significant issues compared to the ground truth, especially considering your request for utmost strictness and vocabulary compliance:

1. **Vocabulary Compliance & Activity Naming**:
   - The mandated vocabulary terms (“Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”) are present, and disallowed synonyms do not appear in the output. This is correct.
   - However, the LLM introduces and merges process steps not authorized in the input:
     - “Approval (if needed)” is not an allowable or existing activity in the original narrative or ground truth. The ground truth specifies “Compliance Officer Approval”.
     - The activities “Payment Scheduling”, “Fund Release”, and “Notification” are not an exact match for any authorized activities. The ground truth uses “Release Funds” and omits “Payment Scheduling” and “Notification” as explicit steps.
   - Capitalization and activity order are not the biggest problem, but “Notification” and “Approval (if needed)” represent noncompliance with the explicit instruction to not rename/merge/add activities. This is a major error.

2. **Role Assignments (RACI errors)**:
   - Fails to assign dual roles (R,A) where required. For example:
     - For “Intake Vetting”, the Front-Office Analyst should be both R and A, but only R is marked.
     - For “KYC Review” and “AML Screening”, the Compliance Analyst is only R, not R,A.
     - For “Risk Scoring”, Compliance Officer should be A, but is only C.
     - “Release Funds” (or “Fund Release” in their table), Treasury Ops should be R, A (only R given).
   - The assignments do not always align with the narrative. For instance, everyone except Treasury Ops is marked Informed (“I”) for some steps where ground truth indicates no involvement.

3. **Matrix Structure and Completeness**:
   - The “Notification” activity is incorrect and not present in the ground truth.
   - There is no use of the dash (–) method for explicitly marking non-involvement.
   - The matrix does not preserve all activities exactly as requested (“do not rename, merge, or add activities”), violating this key instruction repeatedly.

4. **Format**:
   - Markdown formatting is fine. But missing the R,A and – conventions is a notable loss.

**Summary of Major Deductions:**
- -3 for introducing/merging/renaming activities and ignoring explicit instructions.
- -2 for missing the R,A assignments and using only single letters for roles.
- -1.5 for incomplete role mapping, missing explicit non-involvement (–).
- -1 for adding “Notification” and “Payment Scheduling,” which are not in the process list.
- -2 for failing to capture the escalation and approval logic via activity clarity.

**Final Score:** 3.5

If the LLM had simply copied the activity names, respected the role assignments in the narrative, and followed formatting/policy exactly, the score would be much higher. The main reason for severe loss of points is repeated, explicit disregard for instructions to not rename/add/merge activities, as well as sloppy RACI coding.
