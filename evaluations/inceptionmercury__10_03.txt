The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a very low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key failures include:

- **Added and renamed activities**: The LLM introduces unauthorized activities ("Approval (if needed)", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release", "Notification") beyond the four mandated terms and the ground truth's consolidation (e.g., no separate "Notification" or "Payment Scheduling"; ground truth uses "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds"). This violates the prompt's instruction to "do not rename, merge, or add activities" and cover *every* described activity without expansion, resulting in 8 rows instead of 6.

- **Incorrect RACI assignments**: Numerous mismatches, such as:
  - "Intake Vetting": Misses "A" for Front-Office Analyst; incorrectly assigns "I" to Compliance Officer (ground truth uses "–" for no involvement).
  - "KYC Review" and "AML Screening": Misses "A" for Compliance Analyst; treats them identically but omits Front-Office as "–".
  - "Risk Scoring": Wrongly assigns "R" to Compliance Analyst with "C" to Compliance Officer (ground truth has Compliance Analyst "R" only, Compliance Officer "A", and Front-Office "C"); misses Front-Office involvement.
  - No accurate mapping for approval/release: LLM's fragmented rows lack ground truth's "I"/"C" involvements (e.g., no "I" for Front-Office in approval; misses "A" for Treasury Ops in release and "C" from others).

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Empty cells are left blank instead of using "–" for no involvement; lacks bolding (** **) on activities and key R/A cells as in ground truth; no explanatory notes despite ground truth's "*Key points*".

- **Vocabulary adherence**: While the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") are used correctly without leaks, the addition of non-standard activity names indirectly undermines the "using only the authorized vocabulary" rule by fabricating terms not derived from the narrative.

These errors collectively misrepresent the process, inflate the matrix with extraneous content, and ignore precise role involvements, justifying severe point deduction even for smaller issues like missing "A" designations or improper blanks.
