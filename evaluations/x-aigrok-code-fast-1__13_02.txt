The LLM answer is fully correct, with no deviations from the provided data or the requirements:

1. **Occurrence count** is correct: 1.
2. **Percentage calculations:**

   - b) Unique cases: 1/12 = 8.33% — correct to two decimals.
3. **Explanation**:
   - *Single occurrence issue* is highlighted (“appearing in only 1 of 12 cases and 1 of 48 events”).
   - *Variance/instability* is mentioned (“may appear insignificant in this small excerpt, misleading analyses by suggesting it rarely happens”, “Generalizing could underestimate its true frequency”, “flawed performance metrics... missing fraud detection needs”).
   - *Caution against over-generalization* is explicit (“Generalizing could underestimate...”, “not fully captured here”).
   - Well under 100 words.

There are no factual, mathematical, or interpretive errors and all grading criteria are satisfied with appropriate strictness.
