8.5

The LLM answer is nearly perfect on questions 1 and 2, matching the ground truth exactly in values (1; 2.08%; 8.33%) with no errors in calculation or presentation, though it omits the explicit "%" symbol and parenthetical explanations—minor issues under strict criteria, warranting a small deduction (e.g., 9.5/10 for these). For question 3, it stays within 100 words, addresses the single-occurrence issue (i), and cautions against over-generalization (iii) by noting risks in extrapolating from the excerpt to the full log. However, it only partially covers variance/instability (ii), focusing more on frequency underestimation and pattern disruption rather than explicit noise vulnerability, skewing of statistics, or wide confidence intervals as emphasized in the ground truth—resulting in a notable shortfall (7/10 for this part). Overall, high fidelity but strict deduction for incomplete alignment in the explanatory depth required.
