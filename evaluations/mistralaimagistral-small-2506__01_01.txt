4.2

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Major Omissions (Severe Deduction: -4.0 points)**: The LLM answer completely fails to "list all required documents," which is explicitly required in the prompt. The ground truth provides a comprehensive, exhaustive list of 7 documents with notes on conditional usage (e.g., *AuditTrail* for high-value claims) and emphasizes no others. This half of the prompt is ignored, representing a fundamental non-compliance with the task. Strict policy: Total omission of a core required element warrants massive point loss.
  
- **Decision Points Accuracy (Partial Credit but Significant Errors: +1.2 points base, -2.8 net)**:
  - Covers eligibility check (LLM point 2) somewhat accurately but adds "implicit" denial phrasing not in ground truth ("claim rejected/returned"), and introduces unnecessary speculation ("ELSE branch → Claim denied (implicit, as not specified)"). Ground truth is precise without speculation.
  - Misplaces amount threshold decision: LLM incorrectly locates it *inside* **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** (as a decision within that step), while process description and ground truth place it *after* PreApprove as a branching point leading to **Senior_Auditor_Review**. This distorts the flow.
  - Entirely misses ground truth point 3: The "final payment approval" decision (Approved → payment; Rejected → ends), which is implied in constraints (e.g., PreApprove must succeed, and for high-value, Auditor Review completed). Process description emphasizes approvals as gateways, but LLM skips this critical implicit decision.
  - Introduces extraneous "decision point" at **Customer_Submit_Claim** (claiming "no explicit decision"), which is not a decision at all per process (it's linear start). Ground truth omits it entirely, focusing only on true branches. This violates "Do not introduce any activities... not defined above" indirectly by fabricating structure.

- **Structure and Fidelity (Minor Credit: +0.5; Penalty: -0.5 net)**: LLM uses a numbered list, which is clear but less tabular/precise than ground truth. It avoids undefined elements (good), but phrasing like "proceeds to validation" minorly deviates from exact process naming. No introduction of legacy activities (compliance), but overall lacks ground truth's completeness and note on no other elements.

- **Overall Strictness**: With utmost rigor, even partial coverage of decisions is undermined by inaccuracies and the total documents failure. Differences are substantive (not minor), aligning with "more differences... lower grade." Base for partial decisions: ~5.0; deductions yield 4.2. No leniency for implicit assumptions—strict adherence to ground truth required.
