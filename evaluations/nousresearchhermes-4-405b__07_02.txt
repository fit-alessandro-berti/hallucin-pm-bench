### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Added tasks**: Partial accuracy (identifies 2 out of 3 tasks correctly: "Verify Identity" and "Request Additional Documents"). Misses the critical addition of "Final Reject" (`Task_FinalReject`), which is a major omission as it must summarize *all* changes. Excessive extraneous details (e.g., positions, new sequence flows like Flow_1, Flow_2, Flow_5, Flow_8) violate the strict heading focus and ignore instruction to exclude flow changes or cosmetics. This alone warrants a severe deduction.
- **Removed tasks**: Fully accurate on the single removal ("Reject Loan" / `Task_RejectLoan`). However, includes irrelevant details about associated flows (Flow_4, Flow_6), diluting the strict summary and introducing noise not in ground truth.
- **Gateway-type changes**: Correctly identifies the core change (exclusive to inclusive for `Gateway_Decision`). Minor alignment with ground truth's XOR/OR notation, but adds unrelated content: name change ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check," which should be ignored as cosmetic), new flow additions (Flow_6), and flow target/name updates (Flow_4). This misplaces flow-related diffs under the wrong heading, expanding beyond "gateway-type changes" (e.g., Exclusive â†’ Inclusive) and contradicting the "exactly these headings" rule.
- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: Fails to mirror ground truth's concise, bullet-point format without extras. Introduces off-topic elements (flows, implications like "flexible branching logic") that inflate and distort the summary. No evidence of reordered XML ignorance. Strict evaluation penalizes incompleteness (missing task) and irrelevance heavily, despite partial hits on core facts.
