6.0

**Justification and error breakdown:**

**Added Tasks:**
- The LLM correctly identifies "Verify Identity" and "Request Additional Documents" as added tasks.
- However, it **misses "Final Reject" (`Task_FinalReject`)**, which is clearly visible as a new task in v2 but is not mentioned in the "Added tasks" section. This is a major error.

**Removed Tasks:**
- The LLM correctly identifies "Reject Loan" (`Task_RejectLoan`) as removed.
- The explanation regarding sequence flows is **extraneous** (the prompt says to ignore flows and only focus on tasks and gateway type). This distracts from the crispness required. However, the main removed task is given, so partial credit is warranted.

**Gateway-type changes:**
- The LLM correctly notes that "Gateway_Decision" changed from exclusive to inclusive.
- However, it provides **extra, incorrect, or out-of-scope details**: it discusses renaming the gateway, which should be ignored as per the prompt ("Ignore cosmetic renamings"), and mentions changes to sequence flowsâ€”**neither of which are relevant** under this heading.
- The LLM references a "change" involving the gateway's outgoing flows ("Flow_6" and "Flow_4"), which is not a "gateway-type change" per the requested category, but rather a process structure change or simple routing difference, which the prompt explicitly tells the model to disregard.
- It does not mention any non-existent gateway-type changes (so it doesn't introduce inaccurate changes), but it dilutes the answer with details the prompt says to skip.

**General formatting:**
- The headings are correct and strictly followed.
- Some sequence flow explanations creep into all sections, violating the instruction to focus strictly on tasks and gateway-type only.

**Summary:**
- **Biggest deduction:** Missing a whole added task ("Final Reject") and extra content on sequence flows and cosmetic renaming.
- **Smaller deduction:** Some muddying of categories.
- **What is correct:** Correct tasks and gateway change are generally given, and no invented removals or changes are introduced.

Considering these issues and the instruction to be strict, a score of **6.0** is fair. Even a single missing task is a major error per strict grading, and the extra discussion about sequence flows/cosmetic changes is a significant additional flaw.
