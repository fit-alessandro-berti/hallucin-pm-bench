**7.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Strengths (high alignment, preserving ~75% fidelity)**:
  - Correctly identifies the exact same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times (+0 deduction).
  - Precise quantification of SLA exceedances for each (+300s Legal, +300s Risk, +60s Credit) and inclusion of waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s), matching GT exactly (+0 deduction).
  - Uses only table data (e.g., cases like 465, 480, 1 175; compares to Draft Offer's 30s wait), no inventions (+1.0 vs. GT's invented "4805 cases", "€25k", "35% reduction").
  - Bullet points exclusively for recommendations, as required (+0 deduction).
  - ~150 words, executive tone, grounds in data (+0 deduction).

- **Differences/Deductions (strict, significant loss for each)**:
  - **Structure/Format (-1.0)**: Missing formal memo header (To: COO, From:, full Subject with context like "April 2025 sample"); only partial Subject. GT has full professional memo layout; LLM plain para vs. GT's bolded/activity-structured list.
  - **Introduction (-0.5)**: Reworded ("severe SLA breaches and excessive waiting" vs. GT's "materially breach... largest queues"); no total cases or "4 805 completed cases" mention (GT invents, but difference noted).
  - **Recommendations (-1.0)**: Bullets present but each offers **two actions** ("A or B", violating "one concrete action"); content entirely different from GT's single actions (e.g., LLM "add reviewers or parallel pre-screening" vs. GT "rule-based pre-checks bypass"; no GT matches). Data-driven but not matching.
  - **Closing/Extras (-0.0)**: LLM omits GT's invented projection sentence (advantage, per prompt rules, no deduction).
  - **Minor polish (-0.0)**: "1 175" spacing typo; less bold/emphasis; jumps to bullets without "Recommended actions" header.

Overall: Core facts identical (75-80% match), but structural omissions, dual recs, and phrasing/content divergences warrant deduction from 10.0. No criminal/policy issues.
