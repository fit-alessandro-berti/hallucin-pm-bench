**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content, sequence, distinct elements, and ordering:

- Q1/A1: Identical ("3").
- Q2/A2: Identical sequence and separators ("Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order"), ignoring markdown escapes in ground truth.
- Q3/A3: Identical distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered. Formatting (plain lines vs. bulleted HTML) aligns with prompt's "one per line" instruction and does not affect factual precision. No extras, misses, or hallucinations.
