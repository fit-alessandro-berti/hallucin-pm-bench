The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets in Process B, matching the ground truth in substance and order. However, it deducts points for stylistic and formatting deviations under strict evaluation: unnecessary introductory sentence (not in ground truth), use of "and" instead of "‖" for parallelism notation, bolding of entire phrases rather than structured labels like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**", addition of explanatory parentheticals referencing split names (extra detail not in ground truth), and omission of the closing statement affirming no other parallel tasks. These differences, though minor, reflect imperfect alignment with the ground truth's precise structure.
