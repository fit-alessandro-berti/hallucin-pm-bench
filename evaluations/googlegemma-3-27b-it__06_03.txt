9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of tasks in Process B that can execute concurrently, matches the order of appearance, gives the task names accurately, and clearly links each set to its respective parallel split. The answer refrains from discussing Processes A or C, as required.

However, the scoring must be strict:  
- The LLM answer does not use the exact "Set 1/Set 2 – [description]" phrasing (it numbers without the 'Set' label and omits the summary--"No other tasks...")  
- The use of wording ("following the first parallel split") is an informative touch but diverges from the minimal, specific format provided in the ground truth.  
- The task separator is "and" (not ‖), which is less precise than the ground truth's symbol.  

These small differences, while minor, are sufficient for a full point deduction per the strict grading requirement. Thus: 9.0.
