1.0

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Table structure and format**: The LLM uses an inverted, non-standard RACI format (tasks as rows, but R/A/C/I as columns filled with full role names instead of abbreviations like R/A/C/I). The ground truth correctly uses tasks as rows, roles as columns, and single-letter entries in cells, with a proper Markdown header and legend. This is a fundamental error in representing a RACI matrix.
- **Roles**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role entirely (present as the primary Accountable role in every ground truth row) and limits to only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support. This ignores the ground truth's role distribution.
- **Tasks/Activities**: The LLM includes 8 rows with verbose, source-derived phrasing (e.g., "Receive the customerâ€™s transfer instruction and log it in the system", separate "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" and "Notify the Regulatory Liaison"), adding unsubstantiated splits and an extra notification task. The ground truth has exactly 6 concise rows (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", "**KYC Review**" with mandated bolding), omitting SWIFT sending and combining archiving/notification. No row matches precisely.
- **Cell contents and assignments**: The LLM fills cells with full role names (e.g., Responsible: "Transaction Analyst"), not abbreviations, and assignments partially align but differ (e.g., ground truth has Analyst as R for screening with Liaison as A; LLM matches this but in wrong format; archive row in ground truth has Analyst as C and IT as R, but LLM splits and alters). Empties use "-" instead of leaving blank or assigning I/C as in ground truth.
- **Vocabulary and presentation**: While the LLM correctly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst"), it lacks the ground truth's header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), bolding for "KYC Review", and legend. The LLM also introduces inconsistencies like self-notification (Regulatory Liaison informed about their own notification).
- **Completeness**: The LLM adds unsubstantiated elements (separate notify row) and covers source details like SWIFT (missed in ground truth), but this creates divergence rather than fidelity. No omissions in mandated vocabulary, but overall output does not "organise the RACI matrix clearly" as required, violating the prompt's intent mirrored in ground truth.

Even minor phrasing differences (e.g., "Approve the transaction if flagged as high-risk" vs. "Approve High-Risk Transactions") compound the losses. The answer fails to replicate the ground truth's exact structure, content, and precision.
