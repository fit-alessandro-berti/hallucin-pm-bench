3.0

**Rationale for score:**

The LLM answer shows some understanding of the task, but contains several critical errors and omissions compared to the ground truth, each significantly impacting the score:

**Major issues:**

1. **Missing "Operations Manager":** The ground truth assigns "Accountable" roles to "Operations Manager", a role omitted entirely in the LLM answer. This is a significant deviation, as RACI tables must reflect all involved roles.
2. **Use of Correct Vocabulary:** While the answer consistently replaces forbidden terms (e.g., uses “KYC Review” instead of “Customer Due Diligence”), it invents a task (“Notify the Regulatory Liaison”) not present in the ground truth or source text.
3. **Task Wording/Mapping:** The LLM answer splits and rewords activities (e.g., “Ensure the SWIFT message is sent”, “Notify the Regulatory Liaison”), whereas ground truth consistently maps steps to mandated vocabulary with high precision.
4. **Incorrect Role Assignments:** "Accountable" (A) roles are frequently misaligned—e.g., Regulatory Liaison is made Accountable in several steps, rather than assigning this to the Operations Manager.
5. **Imprecise assignment of "Consulted"/"Informed":** The ground truth gives more granular coverage, including “Consulted” and “Informed” roles, which the LLM answer largely ignores or misassigns (often leaving these columns blank).
6. **Redundant steps:** E.g., “Notify the Regulatory Liaison” is an unnecessary step duplicating “informed” status, rather than reflecting a real process activity.

**Summary:**  
- Maintains required vocabulary, but inaccurately applies it.  
- Fails to include all required parties (“Operations Manager”).  
- Does not accurately reflect all process steps or role assignments from the informal description and ground truth.  
- Omits “Consulted” and “Informed” roles where they are essential.  
- Task mapping is imprecise.

Given the combination of missing a major process role, role assignment errors, step mapping issues, and omission/errors in “Consulted”/“Informed,” a **score of 3.0** reflects strict, criteria-based evaluation.
