3.5

The LLM answer displays several significant shortcomings when compared to the ground truth:

**Vocabulary:**
- The four mandated activity names (**Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring**) are correctly used in the activity column.
- The answer *correctly* does not output any synonyms for those activities in the matrix itself.
- However, brief mention of non-authorized synonyms appears in footnotes (“there is no activity named ‘Informed’ directly ...”). Footnote contains minor infraction, but is a gray area.

**Structure & Coverage:**
- The LLM answer *adds* a “Notify Originating Analyst” activity not present in the process narrative or ground truth, which is not allowed according to prompt instructions (“do not rename, merge, or add activities”). This is a major error.
- The answer splits "Release Funds" and "Notify Originating Analyst" (latter should not exist). The ground truth states only "Release Funds."
- The “Compliance Officer Approval” activity is inconsistently represented; “Notify Originating Analyst” with the Compliance Officer as “Consulted” and Treasury Ops as “Accountable” is inaccurate and not in the ground truth.

**RACI Assignments:**
- For **Intake Vetting**, only “R” (not “R, A”) is assigned to the Front-Office Analyst—incorrect, as ground truth is “R, A” (major error).
- For **KYC Review** and **AML Screening**, again only “R” to Compliance Analyst—should be “R, A” (moderate error for both).
- For **Risk Scoring**, Compliance Analyst is “R,” but Compliance Officer is left blank where it should be “A.” The Front-Office Analyst is omitted, even though they should be “Consulted.”
- “Compliance Officer Approval” gives “A” to Compliance Officer and “C” to Compliance Analyst, but Front-Office Analyst should be “I.”
- For “Release Funds,” Treasury Ops gets “R,” not “R, A;” Compliance Officer and Analyst should be “C,” Front-Office Analyst should be “I.” Instead, only Treasury Ops is assigned any responsibility at all.
- Role assignments have major mismatches with the ground truth for almost every activity.

**Formal Markdown/Table Issues:**
- The answer includes a table in Markdown format as required.
- Key/legend for RACI is supplied, as is suitable.

**General:**
- No roles or activities are renamed or merged (aside from unauthorized addition).
- Mild infraction with mention/clarification footnote outside the strict vocabulary context.

**Summary:**  
Significant errors include: unauthorized activity, widespread incorrect/omitted role assignments, repeated missing “A”s, and missed “C”s and “I”s. Vocabulary inside table is correct. Given the cumulative gravity, the answer must score low: 3.5.
