The LLM answer correctly uses the four authorized vocabulary terms without synonyms or leaks, which aligns with the strict policy. However, it fails significantly in several critical areas under utmost strict evaluation:

- **Added an unauthorized activity**: The inclusion of "Notify Originating Analyst" as a separate row violates the instruction to "not ... add activities." The ground truth integrates notification implicitly via "I" (Informed) roles across activities, without a dedicated row. This alone warrants major deduction.
  
- **Incomplete and inaccurate RACI assignments**: Nearly every cell differs from the ground truth, with sparse or missing roles. Examples:
  - Intake Vetting: Misses A for Front-Office Analyst, C for Compliance Analyst, and I for Treasury Ops.
  - KYC Review and AML Screening: Misses A for Compliance Analyst, C for Compliance Officer, and I for Treasury Ops.
  - Risk Scoring: Misses C for Front-Office Analyst, A for Compliance Officer, and I for Treasury Ops.
  - Compliance Officer Approval: Misses R for Compliance Officer, I for Front-Office Analyst.
  - Release Funds: Misses A for Treasury Ops, C for Compliance Analyst and Compliance Officer, and I for Front-Office Analyst.
  These omissions and inaccuracies represent pervasive differences, not minor errors.

- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses blank cells instead of "â€“" for no involvement (as in ground truth). Lacks bolding on activities and key cells. Adds an explanatory legend and note, exceeding the "return the matrix as a Markdown table" instruction. While not the largest issues, they compound the violations under strictness.

- **Overall coverage**: Fails to cover "every activity and role" accurately, with under-assigned involvements (e.g., no I roles except implicitly in the note) and no comprehensive escalation logic reflected.

The correct vocabulary prevents a total failure, but the additions, mismatches, and incompleteness result in a low score reflecting substantial deviation from the ground truth.
