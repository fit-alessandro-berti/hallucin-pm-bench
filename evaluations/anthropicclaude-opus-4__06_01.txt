7.5

The LLM answer is almost correct: it lists both and only the correct pairs, ignores Process A as instructed, and explains its reasoning.
However, it slightly deviates from the expected output format:

1. The pairs are given in code format (\`...\`) rather than strictly following the user's requested format:  
   `Task_X  —  Task_Y`  
   but with *two* spaces before and after the em dash.
2. There is an inconsistent number of spaces around the em dash, not matching the ground truth's two spaces per side.
3. The pairs are otherwise in correct alphabetical order, both within the pair and across the list.

These seemingly small formatting mismatches should incur a significant penalty due to the instruction to grade with utmost strictness—even small errors must reflect in significant point loss. Therefore, a 2.5 point deduction is applied for non-adherence to the exact formatting requested.

Final grade: **7.5**
