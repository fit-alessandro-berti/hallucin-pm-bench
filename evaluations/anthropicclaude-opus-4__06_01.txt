The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs of parallel tasks from Process B ("Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" and "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines"), with proper alphabetical ordering both within pairs and in the overall list, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it deducts points for minor formatting deviations under strict evaluation: inclusion of unsolicited explanatory text before the list (not present in the ground truth output format), enclosing pairs in backticks (unnecessary and not specified), and lack of alignment spacing in the second pair (ground truth uses extra spaces for columnar alignment). These small extraneous elements violate the prompt's strict output instructions, warranting a significant but not total deduction.
