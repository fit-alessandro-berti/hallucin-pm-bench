### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Deductions: ~50% weight)**: The LLM answer identifies the correct three decision points but provides superficial summaries lacking the precise branching logic from the prompt (e.g., no mention of "≤ 2 points" difference, escalation to "Harmonisation Committee," or tie-break for Underwriter Alignment Gate; no outcomes like "system auto-approves" vs. "proceed to step 8" or positioning after "Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for Amount Threshold Decision). Critically, it incorrectly states the Amount Threshold as "<= €15,000" (prompt and ground truth specify "< €15 000" for auto-approval), introducing a factual error on the core condition. Final Micro-loan Board Approval omits "(MBA)" abbreviation and exact vote terminology ("Approve" or "Reject"). These omissions and the inequality error represent substantial deviations, warranting severe point loss for incompleteness and inaccuracy.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Deductions: ~50% weight)**: The list is complete and uses exact terminology, matching all six items closely (e.g., includes "single pay-stub or tax slip" and "(CIS) template," which align better with the prompt than the ground truth's abbreviations). However, small phrasing issues (e.g., bullet format vs. numbered, adding "old" to Proof of Address though it's in the prompt, and no explanatory note like ground truth's) reflect minor inconsistencies. No major errors, but strictness requires deduction for not perfectly mirroring the ground truth's structure and precision.

Overall score reflects high fidelity in document listing but critical failures in decision point details and accuracy, resulting in a low-mid range grade under utmost strict evaluation.
