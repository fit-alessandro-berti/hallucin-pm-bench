7.2

The LLM answer largely covers the key decision points and all required documents and uses the correct activity names, which is good. However, there are significant deviations and omissions when compared with the ground truth, leading to a notable but not drastic point reduction:

**Positives:**
- Lists all the required documents and uses the correct names.
- Identifies the three required decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval).
- Mostly avoids standard loan terminology.

**Errors and Omissions:**
- Does not specify that the "Amount Threshold Decision" happens after the Neighbourhood Feedback Check or that system auto-approval occurs if the amount is less than â‚¬15,000, as in the ground truth.
- Fails to mention that "Underwriter Alignment Gate" leads to escalation to the "Harmonisation Committee" in case of a score discrepancy, which is a notable omission.
- Omits step order/context (e.g., missing the process flow clarifications such as "after the Dual Underwriter Split").
- For required documents, loses some precision (e.g., "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs "Community Impact Statement (CIS)"), though this is minor.
- Does not explicitly state that no other standard loan documents are needed (negative confirmation).
- Section headings ("Decision Points" and "Required Documents") are added, but this doesn't directly violate instructions.

**Conclusion:**
While the answer is accurate on the essentials, it omits subtle but important details about decision logic and flow, and is less precise than the ground truth. Strict grading per your instruction brings the score to 7.2.
