3.0

Rationale:
- **R1:** Correct – marked Compliant, correct justification.
- **R2:** Incorrect – LLM marked Violated, BUT citation is wrong. The rule requires Ship_Goods within 2 days after *the last required approval*, and after the Change_Request (which occurred after approvals), a new Manager_Approval was required (per R5), so the last required approval is on 2025-03-07, but Ship_Goods was on 2025-03-05. The LLM incorrectly treats the last required approval as before the Change_Request. Ground truth is correct; LLM is factually wrong here. This is a critical rule-misreading error.
- **R3:** Correct – marked Violated and correct reasoning (Pay_Invoice before Receive_Goods).
- **R4:** Correct – Not Applicable, correct justification.
- **R5:** Incorrect – LLM marked Compliant, but as per rule, after Change_Request, new Manager_Approval is required before further processing (here, Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice), but Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred BEFORE the new Manager_Approval. Missed violation.
- **R6:** Correct – marked Compliant; correct.
- **Overall:** LLM claims only two violations (R2, R3) when there are three (R2, R3, R5).

Majority of rules evaluated correctly, but two significant factual/methodological errors (R2 and R5: key misreading of compliance logic) that are central to compliance assessment. These are serious errors in process auditing and understanding of the rules in context. Justified points for correct identifications, but heavy deductions for misunderstanding process dependencies and chronology.

**Deduction summary:**
- -3 for R2 incorrect logic and result
- -3 for R5 missed violation
- -1 for overall completeness (summary incorrect)
- -0.5 for R2/R5 justifications (not tight to logic)
- +1 for R1, R3, R4, R6 correct

Final: **3.0**
