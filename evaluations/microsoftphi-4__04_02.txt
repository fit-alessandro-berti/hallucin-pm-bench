### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially matches the ground truth but contains critical errors in rule assessments and justifications, warranting a mid-low score under strict criteria:

- **Format Deviation**: The required output specifies a clear structure (status in bold/all-caps, ≤20-word justification per rule, all-caps overall result). The LLM uses a narrative header style with plain-text statuses and some justifications exceeding 20 words (e.g., R2 ~25 words), losing ~1 point.
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant); justification similar and concise (~10 words). Full credit here.
- **R2**: Status correct (Violated), but justification fundamentally wrong—misidentifies last approval as 03-04 (ignoring change-induced re-approval on 07-03) and miscalculates timing ("2 days exactly" is actually ~1.5 days from 03-04 but irrelevant; true violation is ship before final approval). Significant deduction (~1.5 points).
- **R3**: Status correct (Violated); justification accurate and concise. Full credit.
- **R4**: Status correct (Not Applicable); justification concise. Full credit.
- **R5**: Status incorrect (says Compliant vs. ground truth Violated); justification fails to recognize that Ship_Goods (05-03) and Pay_Invoice (06-03) are "further processing steps" post-Change_Request but pre-new Manager_Approval (07-03), directly violating the rule. Major error (~2 points loss).
- **R6**: Status correct (Compliant); justification concise. Full credit.
- **Overall Result**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but explanation omits R5 violation (lists only R2/R3), reducing completeness (~0.5 points).

Total: ~5/10, reflecting accurate status on 5/6 rules but substantive errors in reasoning, one outright status mismatch, and format issues. Even minor timing misinterpretations (e.g., R2 "implies 'before end of second day'") amplify deductions per strictness directive.
