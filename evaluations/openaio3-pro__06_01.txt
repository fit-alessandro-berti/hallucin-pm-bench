The LLM answer correctly identifies both parallel pairs as required and lists them in the right alphabetical order. There are only minor deviations:

- The LLM does not preserve the specific spacing in the pair "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines" (number of spaces before and after the em dash). The ground truth has extra spacing between the task names and the em dash, which is not matched exactly.
- The response does not use the code block formatting in the output like the ground truth, although the user prompt did not strictly demand this formatting for the answer—just the pair-per-line in the specified format.

Given the "utmost strictness," the formatting discrepancies (spacing and lack of code block) should be penalized, though core content is fully correct. 1 full point is deducted for not matching the output formatting to the ground truth sample.
