The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, identifying the correct and only two parallel pairs from Process B, in proper alphabetical order within pairs and overall (sorted by first task: "Create_Documentation" before "Procure_Materials"). The format adheres to the specified "Task_X  â€”  Task_Y" structure, with one pair per line. Minor spacing variations (e.g., alignment of dashes) do not constitute errors, as the prompt does not require monospaced alignment, and the semantic output is identical. No reference to Process A, no extraneous pairs.
