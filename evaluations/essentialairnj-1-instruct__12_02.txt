**8.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a valid counterexample (C003, lines 6-7) with precise timestamps and case ID, disproving the "always" claim in a single paragraph as required. However, it deducts points for incompleteness by omitting the equally critical C005 counterexample (line 11 with no Receive_Order), which strengthens the justification; minor deductions for extraneous phrasing ("The fact is not accurate."; "Academically:") violating the "Answer **“Yes” or “No” only**" instruction; and lacking the ground truth's structured bullet points for clarity. Under utmost strictness, these omissions and extras represent notable differences despite core accuracy.
