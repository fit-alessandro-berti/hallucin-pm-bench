**10.0**

The LLM answer is substantively identical to the ground truth: both correctly state the value cannot be derived/computed, both explain the absence of timestamps/durations (directly referencing the redacted fields noted in context), and both adhere to the system policy by refusing unsupported claims. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be derived" vs. "cannot be computed"; explicit "duration each instance" vs. "temporal value per event") are stylistic and do not alter meaning or introduce errors. Structure perfectly matches the numbered query. No fabrication, no use of irrelevant benchmarks, utmost fidelity under strict criteria.
