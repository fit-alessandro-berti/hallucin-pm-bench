The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth. It correctly lists both sets of parallel tasks in Process B, in order, and matches the corresponding tasks. However, it omits the explicit block naming ("first parallel block", "second parallel block") and the statement "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." These are minor omissions, but per the instruction to be strict and punish even small errors, this costs a full point. 

Otherwise, the core content is accurate and properly organized, with correct task groupings.
