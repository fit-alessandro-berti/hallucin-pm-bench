### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Vocabulary Policy (STRICT)**: Perfect (10/10). All mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") used exactly; no forbidden terms. Activities match exactly.
- **Correctness of RACI Allocations**: Major failures (1/10). Must reflect ground truth precisely per narrative mapping.
  | Activity | Matching Cells | Issues |
  |----------|----------------|--------|
  | Receive Application | 4/4 | Minor format (**R/A** vs **R / A**), but content matches. |
  | KYC Review | 0/4 | AM: C vs A; CO: **R/A** vs **R**; FC: I vs C; no split R/A. Bold/activity mismatches. |
  | Order Vetting | 4/4 | Matches (minor format). |
  | Payment Clearance | 1/4 | AM: C vs A; CO: I vs C; FC: **R/A** vs **R**; IT matches. No split; wrong consults. |
  | Record Update | 2/4 | FC: I vs C; IT: **R/A** vs **R**. AM/CO match. No A allocation. |
  | Notify Customer | 4/4 | Matches. |
  - Total: ~11/24 cells differ. No single Responsible per row violated, but assignments/self-accountability mismatch narrative/ground truth. AM not A where specified.
- **Unwarranted Content**: Minor issues (7/10). Extra abbreviations "(AM)", "(CO)", etc. in headers (ground truth uses full names only). No extra rows/columns/tasks.
- **Formatting/Markdown**: Poor (3/10). No bold on activity names (**KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**); **R/A** lacks spaces (**R / A**); inconsistent bolding/cells; header spacing/padding differs.
- **Overall**: Basics (vocab/rows) solid, but core RACI (50%+ divergence) + small errors (headers/format) warrant severe deduction. 3 rows perfect, 3 severely flawed → averaged down harshly per "utmost strictness/small errors significant loss".
