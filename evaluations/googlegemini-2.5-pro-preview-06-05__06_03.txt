The LLM answer faithfully lists both sets of concurrent tasks in the correct process, in the right order, and includes no information about the other processes as required by the prompt. It matches the ground truth for both content and sequencing, but omits explicit labels/names for each set and the clarifying note ("No other tasks..."). Also, the set elements are not delimited with clear parallel syntax or formatting (e.g., "â€–"). These are minor errors, but, per the instruction to be strict, they warrant a deduction.
