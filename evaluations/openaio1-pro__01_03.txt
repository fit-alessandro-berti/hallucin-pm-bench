7.2

### Explanation
- **Part (a) Evaluation (major deductions here)**: The ground truth identifies exactly two decision points (the risk-based skip conditional branch and the TriVote gate), with precise phrasing emphasizing the bypass logic (including the "otherwise" clause) and the minimal approval threshold without implying a need for all three inputs upfront. The LLM correctly identifies the skip branch and TriVote but erroneously treats the Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3) as a separate "decision point," which it is not under the prompt's definition of "gate or conditional branch"—it's merely an input step producing an outcome for the true branch in Step 4. This adds an extraneous item (60% match in count/structure, not 100%), and phrasing diverges slightly (e.g., no "otherwise proceeds" in the skip description; TriVote includes misleading "requires all three" language from the process description, which the ground truth clarifies and simplifies). Strict deduction for the extra point and incomplete rule fidelity: -2.0 base, further -0.8 for phrasing gaps.
- **Part (b) Evaluation**: Near-perfect match—lists all documents in exact first-appearance order, with no additions, omissions, or hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML inventions). Minor deduction only for superfluous step parentheticals not present in ground truth (-0.2).
- **Overall**: Strong on (b) and core content of (a), but the decision-point miscount and phrasing differences are significant errors under strict criteria, preventing a higher score.
