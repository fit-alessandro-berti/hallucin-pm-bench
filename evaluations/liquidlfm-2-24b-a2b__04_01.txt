**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and violates utmost strictness criteria:

- **Wrong overall verdict**: Declares "Compliant" vs. ground truth "Non-compliant" (major discrepancy).
- **Rule 2 error**: Falsely claims `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) precedes `Ship_Goods` (event 8); it's reversed (-2.0 impact).
- **Rule 3 error**: Falsely claims `Three_way_match` (event 10) is within ≤2 activities after `Goods_Received` (event 6); distance=4 events (6→7→8→9→10), exceeding window (-2.0 impact).
- Minor format issues: Adds extraneous "Final Answer" and inconsistent numbering vs. ground truth.
- Only Rules 1, 4, 5 correct (partial credit insufficient under strictness).

No tolerance for such critical factual/reading errors; score reflects total non-alignment.
