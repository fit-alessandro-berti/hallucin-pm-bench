8.0

The LLM answer closely adheres to the required vocabulary, using only the preferred terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") and never mentioning the forbidden terms. The activities and roles correspond correctly to the process and there are no extraneous entries.

However, a number of errors merit the loss of points:

- **Format**: The answer does not provide a true RACI matrix table as requested, instead using a list format. While the information is clear, the format is a significant deviation.
- **RACI Assignments**:
  - "KYC Review": The ground truth assigns **R** to Compliance Officer and A to Account Manager, whereas the LLM answer gives R/A (Responsible, Accountable) to CO, and AM is only Consulted (reverse the correct assignment).
  - "Order Vetting": In the ground truth, AM is R/A; LLM reflects this correctly. CO is Consulted in both.
  - "Payment Clearance": The ground truth makes Finance Clerk "R", AM "A", but the LLM assigns both R/A to FC, AM and CO as Consulted. This slightly overstates the AM/CO involvement compared to ground truth.
  - "Record Update": The ground truth gives R to IT Support and Consulted to AM and FC; LLM only gives R/A to IT and Informed to everyone else.
  - "Notify Customer": The LLM answer matches the ground truth.

- **Consulted vs. Informed**: The LLM uses "Informed" for roles that in the ground truth are either C (Consulted) or I (Informed). Some nuances in the designations are lost (e.g., "Record Update" should have AM & FC as Consulted, not just Informed).

- **Accountable/Responsible Assignments**: In some cases the LLM doubles up with "Responsible, Accountable" for single roles, which is not how the ground truth is laid out (e.g., "Receive Application", "Order Vetting", etc.).

Due to these moderate but cumulative deviations in RACI assignments and the expected matrix format, a score of 8.0 is assigned.
