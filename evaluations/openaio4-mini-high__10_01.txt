### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Terminology Adherence (Perfect, 10/10)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere.
- **Format and Structure (Partial, 4/10)**: The prompt specifies a "RACI matrix (activities as rows, roles as columns)". The LLM provides a bulleted list that approximates rows (activities) and sub-bullets (roles as columns), but it is not a true matrix or table like the ground truth. It uses full words (e.g., "Responsible, Accountable") instead of abbreviations (R/A, R, etc.), lacks the tabular layout, and omits bolding/formatting highlights present in the ground truth. This is a structural mismatch, deducting significantly under strictness.
- **Content Correctness (Low, 2/10)**: Major differences in RACI assignments compared to the ground truth, violating the "reflect the narrative" and exact matching expectation. Each activity should have exactly one Responsible (both do), but Accountable placements and Consulted/Informed roles diverge in 4/6 activities:
  - **Receive Application**: CO is I (LLM) vs. C (ground truth) — 1 mismatch.
  - **KYC Review**: AM is C vs. A; CO is R/A vs. R; FC is I vs. C — 3 mismatches (swaps Accountable from AM to CO, misses FC consult).
  - **Order Vetting**: Exact match — 0 mismatches.
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM is C vs. A; FC is R/A vs. R — 2 mismatches (swaps Accountable from AM to FC).
  - **Record Update**: AM is I vs. C; FC is I vs. C; IT is R/A vs. R — 3 mismatches (misses two Consulteds, adds unwarranted A to IT).
  - **Notify Customer**: Exact match — 0 mismatches.
  - Total: 9/24 role assignments differ (counting combined R/A as one). No unwarranted extras (e.g., no new tasks/roles), but these errors misalign with the process narrative's implied accountabilities (e.g., AM as primary Accountable in most steps per ground truth).
- **Overall**: With perfect terminology but flawed format and substantial content errors (small ones like extra A's or missed C's compound under strictness), the score reflects ~40% alignment to ground truth. Deductions are severe per instructions, as even minor RACI shifts alter process responsibilities significantly.
