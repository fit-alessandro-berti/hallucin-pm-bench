**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary mandate (critical, partial credit):** LLM correctly and exclusively uses “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst” (10/10 here). No violations like “CDD” or “Compliance Officer”.
- **Table structure & coverage (-4.0 penalty):** Markdown table present, covers all 6 source tasks in 6 rows. However, columns deviate entirely: introduces unmandated “Informed Stakeholders” (misplaces “I” for Task 6), omits “Operations Manager”, retains “IT Support” but mismatches ground truth columns. Task 5 incorrectly combines “Release payment” + “SWIFT message” into one row (ground truth separates “Release Payment”).
- **Task wording (-1.5 penalty):** Minor rephrasing (e.g., “Receive and log customer transfer instruction” vs. “Receive Payment Instruction”; “Archive case file” vs. “Archive Record”; “Approve high-risk transaction (if flagged)” vs. “Approve High-Risk Transactions”). Not exact matches, violating "organise the RACI matrix clearly" tied to source.
- **RACI assignments (-2.5 penalty):** Fundamentally inaccurate vs. ground truth. Zero rows fully match:
  | Task | Key Mismatches |
  |------|----------------|
  | 1    | Missing Ops Mgr **A**, IT **C** (LLM has IT **I**). |
  | 2    | Liaison **C** vs. **A**; missing Ops Mgr **I**, IT **C**. |
  | 3    | Analyst none vs. **C**; missing Ops Mgr **A**. |
  | 4    | Analyst none vs. **C**; Liaison **A** vs. **R**; missing Ops Mgr **A**. |
  | 5    | Combined row; Liaison **I** matches but IT **R** (shared) vs. **C**; missing Ops Mgr **A**. |
  | 6    | Analyst none vs. **C**; Liaison in wrong column; missing Ops Mgr **A**. |
- **Extra content (-0.5 penalty):** Unnecessary intro, **Key**, **Notes** (ground truth has only **Legend** + concise note). Violates "Put the table in Markdown" implication of minimalism.
- **Overall fidelity:** ~20% alignment (vocab + format basics); ignores ground truth RACI logic, roles, and precision. Strictness demands near-exact match for 10.0; this is a divergent interpretation.
