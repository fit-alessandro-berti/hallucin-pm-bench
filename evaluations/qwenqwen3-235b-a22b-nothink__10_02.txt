6.0

**Rationale for scoring:**

- **Role & Vocabulary Usage:** The LLM answer follows the vocabulary mandate correctly: it never uses forbidden synonyms and employs only “KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, and “Transaction Analyst” for activities and roles, as required. This is crucial.
- **Non-Mandated Roles:** The LLM answer *omits* “Operations Manager,” which is present in the ground truth and appears to be expected for an accountable role in every task. This is a significant omission.
- **Task Mapping & Detail:**
    - The LLM’s tasks generally align, but not perfectly, with the ground truth:
        - “Log transfer instruction” ≈ “Receive Payment Instruction” (wording is close but not as per the ground truth).
        - It lists “Sanctions list screening” and “Screen Against Sanctions List” (wording is non-mandated).
        - Uses “Conduct KYC Review” (fine).
        - “Approve high-risk transaction” (fine).
        - “Release payment”, “Ensure SWIFT message transmission”, “Archive case file”, “Notify Regulatory Liaison of case archiving” – last two are more granular than ground truth.
    - The LLM makes some tasks overly granular (e.g., notification of archiving) and misses the explicit “Accountable” separation for Operations Manager.
- **RACI Assignment Errors:**
    - The LLM frequently conflates Responsible and Accountable (“R/A”) for several tasks, but the ground truth (correctly) separates these responsibilities, e.g., Transaction Analyst is Responsible but not Accountable—a major RACI deviation.
    - Consulted and Informed are mapped differently or omitted compared to the ground truth, causing further divergence.
- **Formatting:** Markdown table is clean and legible.

**Significant Deductions:**
- Omission of “Operations Manager” accountability, which the ground truth includes for every row. (Major process/control oversight.)
- “Sanctions list screening” and “Log transfer instruction” are not using the mandated activity nomenclature as precisely as the ground truth.
- Responsible/Accountable distinctions are sometimes merged, not separated; this risks confusion in process documentation.
- Consulted and Informed assignments deviate in some rows.

**Summary:** Strictly, the LLM stays within the enforced vocabulary **but** omits a key role (Accountable party), merges R/A responsibilities inappropriately, and doesn’t match the ground truth’s precise wording/role assignment for activities. Errors are significant, and per instructions, small deviations are penalised. Thus, the answer is functional and not incorrect in vocabulary, but the structural/process mapping errors justify a substantial deduction.
