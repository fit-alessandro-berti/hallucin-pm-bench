4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment where the LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, leading to substantial point deductions despite some partial alignments. Key differences include:

- **Structure and Columns (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: The ground truth includes an "Operations Manager" column, which is assigned roles (often "A" for Accountable) across all tasks. The LLM omits this entirely, using only three roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support). This creates a fundamentally different RACI matrix, ignoring a core element of the ground truth. While the prompt mandates only specific terms (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison), the evaluation criterion is fidelity to the provided ground truth, not the original prompt.

- **Task Coverage and Naming (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: The LLM includes eight activities, adding rows for "Ensure SWIFT message transmission" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case archiving," which are derived from the source but absent in the ground truth (which has only six tasks and omits SWIFT sending and notification entirely). Task names also differ: e.g., LLM's "Log transfer instruction" vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Conduct KYC Review (sender and beneficiary)" vs. "**KYC Review**" (extra details and wording); "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record." These are not exact matches, violating strict mapping to ground truth phrasing. Small naming variances (e.g., "Sanctions list screening" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List") compound the issue.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.5 points)**: Assignments are almost entirely mismatched. For example:
  - KYC Review: LLM has Transaction Analyst (C), Regulatory Liaison (R/A); ground truth has Transaction Analyst (C), Regulatory Liaison (**R**), Operations Manager (**A**), IT Support (I).
  - Release Payment: LLM has Transaction Analyst (R/A); ground truth has Transaction Analyst (**R**), Regulatory Liaison (I), Operations Manager (**A**), IT Support (C).
  - Similar mismatches across all rows, with LLM combining "R/A" (not used in ground truth) and leaving many blanks, while ground truth separates R/A with bolding for emphasis. The extra rows in LLM have no ground truth equivalent, making comparisons impossible.

- **Formatting and Presentation (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points, but amplified by strictness)**: LLM uses a combined "R/A" notation and a "Notes" section for explanations, while ground truth uses separate **bold** R/A entries, a simple "Legend," and no notes. Headers differ slightly ("Activity" vs. "Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), and ground truth mandates exact vocabulary integration in headers. LLM's Markdown is clear but not identical.

- **Strengths (Partial Credit: +2.5 points base)**: The LLM correctly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") without substitutions, covers the source text more comprehensively than the ground truth (e.g., including SWIFT and notification), and produces a valid Markdown table. No outright violations of the prompt's vocabulary, but this is outweighed by ground truth divergences.

Overall, the LLM answer is a reasonable interpretation of the prompt but shows low fidelity to the ground truth (approximately 45% alignment in core elements), justifying a mid-low score under utmost strictness. Even minor phrasing errors (e.g., activity names) incur deductions as specified.
