4.0

**Explanation:**

**Strengths:**  
- The answer uses the mandated synonyms KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance correctly, with no use of forbidden terms.
- No extra roles or tasks are introduced.
- The structure (table, columns) matches the RACI matrix and uses the right roles.

**Major Weaknesses:**  
- The RACI matrix is incomplete and incorrect:
    - Only "R" (Responsible) is assigned. No A (Accountable), C (Consulted), or I (Informed) allocations are present at all. The ground truth clearly contains many cases of A, C, and I in the table, which are completely omitted.
    - For each row, only the single executing party gets "R"; in the ground truth, some activities (e.g., Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer) have the AM as R/A, which is missing.
    - Other roles' correct involvement (Consulted/Informed) is missing in all activities.
- Role naming in column headers is abbreviated (AM, CO, FC, IT) instead of fully written (Account Manager, Compliance Officer, Finance Clerk, IT Support), as in the ground truth. While not strictly forbidden, this is a nontrivial deviation.

**Other Issues:**  
- Minor: The answer contains extra narrative text offering to extend to full RACI; but this was required by the prompt, and failure to do so is a material shortcoming.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer captures only the absolute basics (just the responsible party per step, with right activity terms). Omission of nearly all RACI detail called for by the prompt and provided in the ground truth means this answer cannot merit more than a 4.0. Points are saved for not violating the strict vocabulary policy and for basic table structure, but it's very far from satisfactory.
