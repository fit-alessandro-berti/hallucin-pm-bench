### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Strength, +1.5 points)**: The LLM correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere. Bold formatting is applied to some mandated terms, aligning partially with ground truth.
  
- **RACI Completeness and Assignments (Major Flaw, -4.0 points)**: The prompt specifies a "RACI matrix," implying full Responsible/Accountable/Consulted/Informed assignments. The LLM only assigns Responsible (R) based on a simplistic reading of the process description (one R per activity, matching performers: AM for Receive/Order Vetting/Notify; CO for KYC; FC for Payment; IT for Record Update). This ignores Accountable (e.g., AM's frequent R/A in ground truth), Consulted (e.g., CO's C in multiple rows), and Informed (widespread I assignments). All rows differ substantially from ground truth (e.g., Receive Application lacks C/I; KYC Review misses AM's A and FC's C). This is a core failure to reflect the "narrative" nuance in ground truth notes (one R per activity but accountable where appropriate). Even small mismatches (e.g., no I for IT in Payment Clearance) compound to show incompleteness.

- **Structure and Formatting (Partial Match, +1.0 point)**: Activities as rows and roles as columns is correct. Table uses markdown. However, columns use abbreviations (AM/CO/FC/IT) instead of full names (Account Manager/etc.), deviating from ground truth and the prompt's role listing. Bold R is minorly present but inconsistent with ground truth's emphasis (e.g., no bold on activities like Payment Clearance where implied).

- **Unwarranted Content (Flaw, -1.0 point)**: Includes extraneous introductory text ("Got it — I’ll replace...") and an offer to "extend to full RACI," violating the ground truth notes' emphasis on no extra tasks/roles/columns or unsolicited additions. Legend is unnecessary and not in ground truth. No new tasks introduced, but the extras dilute focus.

Overall, the answer captures basic structure and vocabulary but fundamentally fails as a full RACI matrix, with pervasive differences in assignments leading to low alignment (only ~30% match in content per row). Strictness applied: even partial correctness doesn't excuse missing RACI elements or extras.
