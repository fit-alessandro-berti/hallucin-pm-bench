The LLM answer correctly identifies the FACT as inaccurate (No), with a precise and factual justification citing the exact violating CaseIDs (C002 and C004) and their intervening activities, directly addressing the "always" claim. This aligns closely with the ground truth's core conclusion and evidence. However, under utmost strictness, it loses a full point for lacking the ground truth's exhaustive case-by-case verification of all instances (e.g., omitting confirmation of compliance in C001 and C003), which provides fuller transparency on the "always" scope without adding extraneous details. No factual errors or deviations in cited evidence.
