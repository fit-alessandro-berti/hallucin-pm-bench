8.0

The LLM correctly answers "No," provides the appropriate CaseIDs (C002 and C004), and accurately cites the sequences demonstrating violations of the stated FACT. The core reasoning is clear and precisely mapped to the log evidence, matching the essence of the ground truth explanation.

However, compared to the ground truth, there are notable omissions:

- The LLM does not systematically review all cases (C001 and C003 are omitted), while the ground truth delivers a comprehensive, case-by-case justification.
- The LLM does not explicitly mention that *in two of four cases* the rule fails, nor does it state that in other cases the activity does follow immediatelyâ€”both present in the ground truth.
- The LLM slightly paraphrases ("These deviations show...") instead of quantifying or tabulating case-wise results as the ground truth does.

While the answer is factually correct and identifies the most relevant violations, the lack of completeness and thoroughness warrants a significant point reduction. Thus, 8.0 reflects these important but not critical shortcomings.
