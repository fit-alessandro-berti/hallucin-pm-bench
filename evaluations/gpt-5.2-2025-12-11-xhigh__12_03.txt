The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and directly matches the task requirements (Yes/No + justification citing relevant CaseIDs and sequences). It correctly identifies the same counterexamples (C002, C004) with precise sequences, notes the compliant cases (C001, C003), and refutes the "always" claim equivalently to the ground truth. Differences are only in presentation (bullets vs. table) and minor extraneous sequence detail in C004 (irrelevant Pack_Items after Validate_Payment, but harmless). No factual errors, omissions, or deviations under strict evaluation.
