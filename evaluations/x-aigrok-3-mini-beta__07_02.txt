8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (contributing to higher score)**: The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all added tasks (3 total: Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), the single removed task (Task_RejectLoan), and the exact gateway change (Exclusive to Inclusive for id="Gateway_Decision"). It uses the exact required headings without adding extraneous categories, ignores irrelevant changes (e.g., names, flows, XML ordering), and focuses strictly on structural diffs as prompted. No factual errors in content identification.
- **Weaknesses (deducting points)**: 
  - Presentation of added/removed tasks uses only IDs in bullet points, omitting the descriptive names (e.g., "Verify Identity") that the ground truth emphasizes first with bolding and parentheses for IDsâ€”this reduces clarity and human-readability, a small but notable deviation under strict scrutiny.
  - Gateway description lacks the ground truth's explicit "from exclusive (XOR) in v1 to inclusive (OR) in v2" phrasing, using a more generic "Exclusive Gateway... changed to Inclusive Gateway" without the abbreviations or version references, which adds minor imprecision.
  - Includes an unnecessary introductory paragraph (explaining adherence), which violates "strictly under the three requested headings" by adding unrequested prose; ground truth has none.
  - Formatting differs (bullets vs. numbered lists; no bolding), but this is minor compared to content gaps.
- **Overall**: High fidelity to core changes (95% match in substance), but strict deduction for detail omissions, extra text, and format mismatches results in a strong but imperfect score. No evidence of hallucination or missing changes.
