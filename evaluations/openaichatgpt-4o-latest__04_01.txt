8.2

The LLM answer accurately identifies the case as "Non-compliant" and gives correct, detailed explanations for the rules in question, closely matching the ground truth. However, a few issues cause a notable deduction:

- The LLM initially claims "Rule 3 satisfied" before self-correcting, even though it quickly amends this. In a strict evaluation, this kind of confusion, even if fixed, suggests a lack of precision.
- For Rule 3, the LLM first says "within the next four events" before correctly stating the rule ("distance ≤ 2"), and only afterwards points out the violation. The answer could be clearer and more directly state the rule is violated from the outset.
- The order of reporting in the justification (“Correction:”) is a little less crisp than the model ground truth answer.
- Minor formatting and answer structuring differences from the ground truth are visible (e.g., check-mark/emoji use, the phrase "Corrected summary," etc.), which while not substantive, do impact strictness under your guidelines.

Content-wise, the key compliance violations and rule satisfaction points are all correctly identified and explained, matching the ground truth logic and referencing the right evidence.

Overall: strong answer with small clarity/formatting faults and momentary confusion in the Rule 3 section.
