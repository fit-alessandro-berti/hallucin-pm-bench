7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Compliance and Core Accuracy (8/10)**: The LLM correctly determines "Non-compliant" and accurately identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event citations matching the ground truth. Assessments for Rules 1, 4, and 5 are also correct and align closely with the ground truth's explanations.
- **Format and Structure (5/10)**: Significant deviation from the specified format ("Non-compliant" followed by a numbered justification citing relevant rules). The response uses a disorganized numbered list (out of rule sequence: starts with Rule 2 as #1, Rule 1 as #2), incorporates unnecessary ✅/❌ icons, includes an initial incorrect assessment for Rule 3 followed by an in-line "correction," and adds extraneous sections ("Final determination" and "Corrected summary") that rephrase only the violations, rather than a clean, sequential per-rule justification like the ground truth.
- **Precision and Minor Errors (7/10)**: Mostly precise, but small errors impact strict scoring: (1) Initial miscalculation for Rule 3 ("within the next four events," implying incorrect distance assessment before self-correcting), and (2) slight discrepancy in distance phrasing ("four activities later" vs. ground truth's "distance = 3"), though the violation conclusion is identical. These reflect sloppiness under utmost strictness.
- **Completeness (8/10)**: Covers all five rules, unlike the "Corrected summary" which omits satisfied ones, but this redundancy highlights inconsistency.

This score reflects strict penalties for structural messiness and the self-corrected error, despite substantive alignment.
