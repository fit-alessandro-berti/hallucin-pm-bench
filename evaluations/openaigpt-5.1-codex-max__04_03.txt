The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in conclusion (No), overall assessment (non-compliant due to Rule 3), and per-rule justifications (all rules correctly evaluated with matching reasoning: Rule 1 satisfied as QE once before RA; Rule 2 satisfied as VP after both for High severity; Rule 3 violated as NA before RA; Rule 4 satisfied as CC after NA/VP). Format differences (paragraph vs. table) are stylistic and not required by the prompt, which requests only "Yes/No, and give a short justification referencing each rule." No errors or violations present.
