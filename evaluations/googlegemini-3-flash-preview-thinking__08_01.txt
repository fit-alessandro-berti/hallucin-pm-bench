8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
**Strengths (supporting high score):**
- Correctly answers **Yes** with a valid, minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 fires before T3 in a reachable marking, directly matching the prompt's requirement.
- Accurate markings implied (e.g., p3=1, p4=0 post-T2) and correct inhibitor arc explanation (enabled only if p4=0).
- Brief justification captures the core reason: parallel branches allow T2 before T3, keeping p4 empty—aligns with ground truth's enabling condition.

**Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness, ~2pt loss):**
- **Conceptual/terminology errors** (major for Petri nets): States "**p0 fires**" and "**p1 fires**" (twice)—places do *not* fire; *transitions* (T1/T2) do. Ground truth avoids this entirely, using precise "**T1** (p0 → p1 + p2)". Basic mistake, not "small."
- Incomplete sequence: Stops at T5 without showing T3 afterward (ground truth extends to T3/T4, confirming T3 fires later and disables T5).
- Misses deeper insight: Ground truth proves T5 "**must**" fire before T3 (p4 never empties post-T3 except with T4), with permanence noted. LLM implies but doesn't state/explain.
- Style/precision diffs: Partial markings (vs. ground truth's explicit `p1=1, p2=1`); different notation (xrightarrow vs. → `markings`); no continuation path.

Substance is 90%+ aligned (correct yes + sequence), but strict policy on *any* differences/errors (esp. terminology) warrants deduction to 8.0. Identical answer would be 10.0.
