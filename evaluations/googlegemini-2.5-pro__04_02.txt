**Justification:**

- **R1:** Correct, matches ground truth.
- **R2:** LLM answer incorrectly assesses as "Compliant" and justifies using the pre-change approvals; however, per ground truth, it should be "Violated" because the last required approval after Change_Request is the new Manager_Approval (07-Mar-07), and Ship_Goods happened before this (05-Mar-05), more than 2 days earlier.
- **R3:** Correct, matches ground truth.
- **R4:** Correct, matches ground truth.
- **R5:** Correct judgment ("Violated") and reasonable justification that matches ground truth.
- **R6:** Correct, matches ground truth.
- **Overall result:** Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).

**Core issue**: The LLM inappropriately interprets R2 in the context of the approval following a Change_Request, which is a critical process rule, thus it's a significant error. However, all other rules are correctly assessed, including the main logic for R5 ("Violated") with adequate reasoning. The response is clear and follows the required format.

**Score heavily penalizes the critical compliance error for R2.**
