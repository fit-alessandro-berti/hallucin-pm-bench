The LLM answer is mostly accurate in format and status for R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6, with justifications under 20 words and overall conclusion correct (NON-COMPLIANT due to violations). However, R2 has a major error: incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated) and flawed justification ignoring the new approval after Change_Request, which delays the 2-day shipping windowâ€”significant deduction for misinterpreting the rule and event sequence. Minor difference in R5 justification (mentions Receive_Goods unnecessarily) warrants slight further loss under strict criteria.
