The LLM answer fails to adhere to the required output format (no proper unified diff with hunk markers like @@ and -/+ lines; instead, it provides raw XML snippets), proposes two separate attribute modifications (changing dueDates on *Task_CreateRecord* and *Task_PrepareContract*) instead of exactly one improvement as mandated, does not address the evident SLA breach in *Task_CollectEquipment* (P5D exceeds a presumed 3-day total SLA), and provides an inaccurate rationale that misinterprets deadline mechanics without aligning to the ground truth's focused fix.
