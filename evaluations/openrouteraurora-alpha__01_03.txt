**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Part (a) – Decision Points (Major Errors: -4.0 impact)**  
- Ground truth identifies **exactly 2** decision points: (1) the post-Tri-Color conditional skip (risk + amount), (2) TriVote gate (2/3 approvals).  
- LLM incorrectly lists **5**, fabricating non-decisions:  
  - #1: Tri-Color-Risk-Check is a *step producing input*, not a "decision point (gate or conditional branch)."  
  - #4: Applicant Confirmation (step 8) is linear "request," not a gate/branch.  
  - #5: Finalization (step 9) is not a decision.  
- LLM's #2 and #3 are mostly accurate but use suboptimal phrasing/naming vs. ground truth (e.g., "Risk-and-Amount Branch" vs. "Risk-based skip"; table format adds noise).  
- Over-inclusion + misidentification = incomplete/wrong summary.

**Part (b) – Documents (Major Errors: -1.8 impact)**  
- Ground truth: **9 items** in precise first-appearance order, including **3 Scorecards** (step 3 inputs, explicitly "required").  
- LLM lists only **5**, **missing all 3 Scorecards** (hallucinatory omission; they precede Deck Memo).  
- Minor issues: Merges "Offer Sheet 77" + "Signed Offer Sheet 77" into one; ID Matrix correct but list incomplete. Order wrong (Deck Memo before scorecards).  
- No KYC/AML hallucination (neutral).

**Overall:** Partial credit for capturing the 2 real decisions + some docs (~40% accurate), but strict penalties for extras, misses, and distortions yield 4.2. Small errors (phrasing/order) deduct further per instructions.
