The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a valid counterexample (C004) with the precise sequence and timestamps, directly refuting the "always" claim. However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it claims "one case" (C004) but misses the second counterexample (C002, where Pack_Items intervenes), fails to analyze all cases exhaustively as a "meticulous process-mining analyst" would (per ground truth's case-by-case table), and uses simpler prose without the structured, comprehensive verification or explicit conclusion on multiple violations. This partial coverage introduces a meaningful difference from the ground truth, warranting deduction despite logical sufficiency of one counterexample.
