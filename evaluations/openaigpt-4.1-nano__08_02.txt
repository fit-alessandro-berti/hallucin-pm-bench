The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it wrongly concludes "No" for Q1 (ground truth is "Yes"), provides an invalid firing sequence for Q2 (T1 → T2 → T4 skips T7, making T4 impossible as P4 lacks a token after T2, resulting in {P2, P3}), and offers flawed reasoning (claims T3 is essential before T5, ignoring the parallel path via T2-T7-T4 that preserves P2's token for T5 without T3). This mismatches the ground truth entirely, demonstrating no understanding of the net's behavior.
