6.0

**Analysis:**

- The LLM answer makes a credible effort but has several notable shortcomings compared to the ground truth:
  - It incorrectly lists **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** as a decision point, even though it's a process task, not a branching decision.
  - It fails to specify that the **Underwriter Alignment Gate** comes after the **Dual Underwriter Split**, and omits details about escalation to the **Harmonisation Committee** if needed.
  - Does not clarify that the **Amount Threshold Decision** occurs after the **Neighbourhood Feedback Check**, and omits details about what happens for each possible outcome (system auto-approve vs. proceeding to board).
  - The rationale and precise conditions at each decision point (as done in the ground truth with “if/else” statements) are not included.
  - While the process step names are used mostly as provided, the answer is less explicit about flow and conditional logic.
  - The required documents list is correct and complete, but the wording for “Community Impact Statement (CIS) template” and very minor variations (“Digital Application Form” vs “Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)”) are beneath the strictness threshold but are very minor.
  - The answer does not introduce unallowed “standard loan terminology,” which is good.

Given the prompt’s demand for utmost strictness and correct flow, as well as inclusion of all specified details and exact terminologies/branching logic, these issues should result in a significant penalty. However, the LLM answer is not wholly incorrect: all core decision points (except misplacing KYC and omitting escalation/Harmonisation Committee details) and all documents are present.

**Therefore, a 6.0 is given.**
