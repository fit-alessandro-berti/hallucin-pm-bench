### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major errors, significant deduction)**: The ground truth identifies exactly three branching decisions (Underwriter Alignment Gate with full conditional details, Amount Threshold Decision with context and conditions, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval with approve/reject outcome). The LLM answer incorrectly includes a fourth point (Quick KYC Verification), which is a linear verification step, not a decision branch—this is a fundamental misinterpretation of "decision points," warranting a large penalty. Additionally, the LLM's descriptions are overly brief and lack key ground truth details (e.g., no mention of the Dual Underwriter Split as the precursor to Alignment Gate, no post-Neighbourhood Feedback Check context for Amount Threshold, no capitalization or exact phrasing for MBA outcomes). This results in incomplete and inaccurate summarization.
  
- **Required Documents (minor errors, moderate deduction)**: The list is nearly complete and uses exact terminology (e.g., ML-APP-01, CIS). However, small wording variances reduce precision: "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; includes "template" for CIS where ground truth omits it. The ground truth includes a clarifying note on exclusions (e.g., no credit bureau), which the LLM omits, missing nuance. These are small but, per instructions, incur significant loss.

- **Overall Structure and Adherence (minor deduction)**: The LLM uses exact activity names and avoids standard terminology, which is positive. However, it adds an unsolicited clarification question, introducing extraneous content not in the prompt or ground truth.

Strict scoring reflects the core inaccuracies in decision points, leading to a low-mid range despite partial correctness in documents.
