The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt. Substance is a perfect match (no extraneous info on A/C, no errors in parallelism detection). Deduction of 1.0 point for minor formatting/presentation differences vs. ground truth (lacks bolding, descriptive labels like "Set 1 – first parallel block:", `backticks`, ‖ symbol, and closing sentence), treated strictly as small errors per evaluation criteria.
