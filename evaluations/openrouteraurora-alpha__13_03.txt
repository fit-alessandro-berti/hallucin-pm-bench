**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (40% weight)**: Correct count (1), but adds extraneous details (case ID, timestamp) beyond ground truth's minimal "1". Minor deduction for verbosity (-0.5 from 10).
- **Part 2 (60% weight)**: Significant differences. Misses core ground truth points: tiny sample quantification (14 events/3 cases/<2h), frequency swing (0%-7%), wide CI, rare-event sampling error, near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) & matching pitfalls. Instead, speculates invalidly (bias to "quick" cases, seasonal variations—violates "no speculation" rule). Generic representativeness lacks precision. Word count compliant (~95), but content diverges sharply (-6.5 from 10).
- **Overall**: Strict per instructions; speculation & omissions warrant heavy penalty despite partial overlap on non-representativeness.
