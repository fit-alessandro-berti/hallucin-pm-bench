### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, Significant Deduction)**: The LLM incorrectly includes **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** as a decision point with a "stop if verification fails" condition, which is not identified as a decision point in the ground truth (or explicitly in the process flow; it's a verification step without branching specified). This adds unsubstantiated content, violating strict adherence to the prompt's focus on actual branches. Additionally, treating **Harmonisation Committee** as a standalone decision point deviates from the ground truth, which integrates it directly into the **Underwriter Alignment Gate** description. The LLM's list format and phrasing (e.g., "> 2 points" vs. precise "≤ 2" threshold with escalation details) introduce minor inaccuracies. Ground truth limits to exactly three core branches with precise integration and numbering. These additions and restructurings represent over-interpretation and structural mismatch, warranting a heavy penalty (base ~4/10 for this section).
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors, Moderate Deduction)**: The list matches the core items exactly in content and order, which is positive. However, small phrasing differences accumulate penalties under strictness: "≤ 3 months old" vs. ground truth's concise "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (unnecessary "single" and "or" elaboration); "CIS template" vs. "CIS" (extra word not in ground truth). Critically, the LLM omits the ground truth's closing note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"), which reinforces the "complete list" and ties to the prompt's warning against standard terminology. No other extras, but these lapses reduce completeness (base ~7/10 for this section).

- **Overall Structure and Adherence**: The LLM uses exact activity names (good), avoids standard terminology (good), and provides a clear summary format. However, the prompt demands a faithful summary without extras, and the ground truth's concise, numbered structure with integrated details is not replicated—leading to broader misalignment. Total score reflects ~55% fidelity: core accuracy but undermined by additions, omissions, and phrasing tweaks.
