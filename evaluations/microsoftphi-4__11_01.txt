### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities and metrics: 10/10)**: The three worst activities by average waiting time are accurately identified and ranked (#1 Request_Documents, #2 Send_Closure_Letter, #3 Assess_Liability). Both average and 95th-percentile waiting times are quoted verbatim from the table, with no mention of service times, throughput, or other activities.
- **No unwarranted content (8/10)**: Sticks to waiting times only; no extraneous metrics. However, includes unnecessary memo formatting (e.g., "To:", "From:", subject line, closing signature, and an extra advisory sentence: "Immediate implementation is advised..."), which adds ~30 words and deviates from the ground truth's crisp, header-free structure. This bloats the response slightly (total ~140 words vs. ground truth's ~100).
- **Action relevance and data-driven quality (4/10)**: Actions are logically tied to waiting-time issues and each promises ≥20% reduction, fulfilling the basic requirement. However, they are generic (e.g., "automated document request system," "automated letter generation," "decision-support tools") and lack the concrete, data-driven specificity of the ground truth (e.g., no references to pilots, escalations, e-signatures, or rules-engines; uses vague "expected/predicted" instead of evidence-based estimates like "pilot tests show ≥25%" or "estimated 30%"). This represents significant differences, failing the "data-driven" mandate and introducing unsupported speculation.
- **Overall strictness adjustment**: Under 150 words and executive-memo style, but format extras and action vagueness create notable divergences from the ground truth's concise, precise blueprint. Small format errors compound with major action shortcomings for a mid-range score.
