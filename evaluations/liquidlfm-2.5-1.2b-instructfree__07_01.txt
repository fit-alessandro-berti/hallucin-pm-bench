**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth and prompt:

- **Added tasks**: Incorrectly lists "None"; ground truth has two specific tasks with names and IDs.
- **Removed tasks**: Incorrectly lists "(none)"; ground truth has one specific task with name and ID.
- **Gateway type changes**: Partially detects the `gw_valid` change but incorrectly phrases as "Added Gateway type change: `inclusiveGateway` to `gw_valid`" (wrong direction, not "added," misses v1/v2 types explicitly).
- Ignores "use element names exactly as in XML" (e.g., task IDs/names).
- Uses wrong format for empty categories ("- None", "- (none)" vs. "(none)").
- Adds extraneous chit-chat ("Certainly!... Let me know...") violating "list **only** the factual differences."
- Headings not exactly as specified (prompt: "• Added tasks" etc.; uses **bold** with dashes).

Zero correct categories, multiple violations = minimum score.
