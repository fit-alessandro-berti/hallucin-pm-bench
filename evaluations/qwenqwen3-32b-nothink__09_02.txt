The LLM answer is semantically identical in core reasoning (impossibility due to absent timestamps/temporal data) and follows the prompt's format for an undeterminable value with a single concise sentence. It loses a minor half-point for slightly less precise phrasing that omits explicit references to "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals" present in the ground truth, per the strict evaluation criteria.
