The LLM answer is factually accurate, correctly identifies the non-compliance due to Rule 3 (NA before RA), and references all rules with appropriate OK/VIOLATION labels. However, under utmost strictness: (1) Rule 3 justification omits explicit reference to the "both QE and RA" requirement from the rule (ground truth emphasizes this for completeness), a small but notable gap in precision; (2) Rule 1 phrasing slightly abbreviates "once each and in that order" compared to ground truth's explicit "precedes"; (3) lacks the ground truth's structured table, overall summary statement, and minor rephrasing for rule restatement, introducing minor stylistic differences. These deduct 0.8 points from a perfect 10.0.
