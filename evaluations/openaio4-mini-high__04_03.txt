9.0

The LLM answer is concise, identifies the correct verdict ("No"), and references each rule, specifying which are satisfied and which are violated. The justification for the violation of Rule 3 is correct and clearly stated.

However, there are minor differences from the ground truth:
- The LLM answer does not provide as much structured detail or reasoning as the ground truth, which uses a table format and gives slightly more explicit explanations per rule.
- The gold standard explains for Rule 3 that NA occurs before RA is completed, while the LLM answer only states “Notify_Authorities occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review (VIOLATION)”—the core reasoning is present, but not elaborated as explicitly as in the ground truth.
- The answer does not restate the verdict in a full sentence as the ground truth does.

These are minor, but under very strict grading, they merit a deduction. Thus, 9.0.
