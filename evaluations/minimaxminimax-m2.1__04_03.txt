**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate, complete, and directly matches the ground truth in conclusion (No), rule-by-rule assessments (1/2/4 satisfied, 3 violated), and reasoning (NA before RA violates rule 3 despite QE prior; all positions and requirements correctly referenced). No factual, logical, or interpretive errors. Minor stylistic differences (text list vs. table; no redundant summary sentence) do not constitute errors under the prompt's requirements for a short justification per rule.
