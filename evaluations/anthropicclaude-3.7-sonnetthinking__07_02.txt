### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all added tasks (Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents, Final Reject), the single removed task (Reject Loan), and the gateway change (from exclusive to inclusive) under the required headings, aligning with the ground truth content. Formatting variations (e.g., bullet points vs. numbered lists, quotes vs. bold/backticks) are minor but deduct points for not matching precisely. The gateway description lacks the semantic precision of "exclusive (XOR)" and "inclusive (OR)" with version references, warranting a deduction. Most critically, the extra introductory title and concluding paragraph provide unrequested interpretation (e.g., flow modifications and renaming acknowledgment), violating the "strictly under the three requested headings" instructionâ€”this is a significant deviation, as the ground truth remains concise and bounded to the headings with only a closing note on completeness. No other errors, but strictness demands substantial penalty for extraneous content.
