9.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth in substance but suffers noticeable point loss for not using the required exact formatting and element name representation. Specifically:

- The LLM mixes presentation styles by using bullet points (•) in headings and not bolding them per the ground truth.
- Task listings omit the id=... notation required by the prompt (they show the names, then ids in parentheses, but not id=...)—the prompt requires using the "element names exactly as they appear" and the ground truth uses the syntax "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)".
- Gateway change heading is slightly less precise in phrasing compared to the ground truth.

No factual errors are present, but these deviations in format and precision deserve a significant penalty under strict grading.
