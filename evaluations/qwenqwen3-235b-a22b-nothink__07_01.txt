The LLM answer is factually accurate in identifying the changes (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway: gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive). However, under utmost strictness, deduct points for minor formatting inconsistencies with the ground truth: bullet styles (- vs *), id presentation ((id) vs (id = `id`)), unnecessary inclusion of the gateway's "name" attribute ("Warranty Valid?") not present in the ground truth, and omission of version specifiers ((v1) to (v2)). These small deviations from exact structure and phrasing warrant a significant but not total deduction.
