**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correct elements (+ points)**: Overall verdict "Non-compliant" matches (major +). Correctly identifies violations in Rule 2 (Risk_Assessment after Ship_Goods) and Rule 3 (Three_way_match distance >2) (+1.5 total).
- **Major errors (- significant points)**:
  - Rule 1: Falsely claims violation ("only one approval"); ignores Procurement_Officer approval at #2. Ground truth: satisfied (-1.5).
  - Rule 3: Wrongly labeled "Rule 10" (non-existent); lacks precise distance/event citation (-0.5).
  - Rule 4: Falsely claims violation; misstates rule (Intern follows Warehouse_Clerk, not CFO; no CFO proximity). Ground truth: satisfied (-1.5).
  - Rule 5: Correct but incomplete (no event citation); format lists as compliant amid wrong violations (-0.3).
- **Format/Completeness issues (- points)**: No per-rule "Satisfied/Violated" labels; no event citations; no summary of *which* rules cause non-compliance; extra fabricated violations obscure true issues (-0.7).
- **Overall**: ~40% alignment (2/5 rules correct + verdict); strictness demands near-perfect match → low score despite partial accuracy.
