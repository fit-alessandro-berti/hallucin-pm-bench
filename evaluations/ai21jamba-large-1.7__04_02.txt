6.0

Reasoning:
- **R1**: The LLM answer incorrectly marks R1 as Violated, arguing that a new Finance Approval is required after a Change_Request. The ground truth correctly states R1 is Compliant: only Manager and Finance Approval are needed before any further step if total_amount > €10 000, and nothing in R1 refers to further Finance_Approval after a Change_Request, so the LLM made a significant error here. (-2 pts)
- **R2**: The LLM answer gives the wrong result here (Compliant) while it is actually Violated in the ground truth. After the Change_Request, a new Manager_Approval (07-Mar) occurs, so the 2-day window should be counted from that event, and Ship_Goods happened before this approval. (-2 pts)
- **R3**: Correct—both the LLM and ground truth say Violated. (+0)
- **R4**: Correct—Not Applicable in both answers. (+0)
- **R5**: Correct reasoning and status: Violated in both answers. (+0)
- **R6**: Correct—Compliant in both answers. (+0)
- **Overall result**: NON-COMPLIANT both in LLM and ground truth, appropriate based on the violated rules. (+0)
- **Justifications**: On R1 and R2 the justifications are flawed due to the misinterpretation of rules, and these are significant errors.

Summary:
Two major errors on R1 and R2 impact the reliability of the assessment. The rest (R3, R4, R5, R6, overall) are correct, but the answer cannot be rated higher than 6.0 due to inaccuracies on two of the most important compliance rules.
