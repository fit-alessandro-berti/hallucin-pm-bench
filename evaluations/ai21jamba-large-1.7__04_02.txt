The LLM answer has critical errors: R1 incorrectly marked as Violated (should be Compliant; misinterprets rule as requiring post-change Finance_Approval, which R1 does not), with flawed justification exceeding 20 words and irrelevant details. R2 incorrectly marked as Compliant (should be Violated; ignores new Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07 as the last required approval, making Ship_Goods timing non-compliant), with incorrect justification. R5 status correct but justification imprecise (focuses on approval timing without clearly stating further steps preceded it). R3, R4, R6 correct. Overall status matches but justification adds unneeded details. Format deviates slightly from strict per-rule bold status + â‰¤20-word justification. Two major rule misclassifications and justification issues warrant severe deduction under strict criteria.
