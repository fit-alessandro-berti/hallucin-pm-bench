8.0

The LLM answer is quite accurate, adhering to the required terminology and listing the correct decision points and submission documents. Here is a breakdown of the evaluation:

**Positives:**
- The answer uses the exact activity names as instructed (e.g., "Underwriter Alignment Gate", "Amount Threshold Decision", "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)").
- The answer correctly identifies and briefly explains each decision point.
- Every required document is listed by the right name.
- The answer does not introduce any standard loan terminology.

**Errors and Omissions:**
- The "Underwriter Alignment Gate" description omits the explicit mention that it occurs after "Dual Underwriter Split." While implied by order, this is less precise than the ground truth.
- The "Amount Threshold Decision" does not specify it is "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check." Again, the ordering implies this, but explicitness was required.
- The document list includes "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" and "(CIS) template" instead of matching ground truth's exact parenthetical wording. While close, this is a small but noted deviation.
- The answer does not include the negative clarification given in the ground truth: "(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)"
- Formatting is not an exact match, though clarity is preserved.

**Scoring justification:**  
The deviations are minor in terms of meaning but, following "utmost strictness," these explicitness, wording, and completeness issues merit a notable deduction, resulting in a score of 8.0.
