**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: LLM correctly states "1 time" with evidence (CaseID 1002), aligning precisely with ground truth's "1" and case reference. Full points here.
- **Q2 (major partial credit, significant deductions)**: 
  - Strengths: Notes small sample (3 cases), short timeframe, risk of overgeneralization—core ideas overlap (~60% alignment).
  - Weaknesses (strict deductions: -2.8 total):
    - Misses quantification (14 events, <2 hours, frequency swing 0%-7%, wide confidence interval, sampling error for rare events: -1.2).
    - Omits critical synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and strict/fuzzy matching distortion (-1.0).
    - Minor inaccuracy: "1 out of 3 cases, suggesting rare" misframes (33% not "rare"; snippet could overestimate): -0.3.
    - Slight speculation ("e.g., flagged for review") edges against "no speculation" rule: -0.3.
  - Word count compliant (68 vs. ≤120).
- Overall: Strong but lacks ground truth's precision/depth; strictness demands near-exactness.
