The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without any forbidden variants, and it accurately identifies the Responsible (R) roles based on the process narrative. However, it significantly deviates from the ground truth in several critical ways, warranting a low score under strict evaluation:

- **Incomplete matrix population**: The ground truth fully assigns R, A, C, and I across all roles for each activity, reflecting inferred process interactions (e.g., consultations and notifications). The LLM leaves most cells blank, implying no involvement, which ignores widespread C and I assignments (e.g., all roles as I for Notify Customer; CO as C for Receive Application).
- **Incorrect Accountable (A) assignments**: For KYC Review, A is wrongly placed on CO instead of AM; for Payment Clearance, A on FC instead of AM; for Record Update, an unwarranted A is added to IT (ground truth has no explicit A, but the LLM's addition conflicts).
- **Formatting and presentation differences**: Uses separate **R**, **A** instead of **R / A**; includes unnecessary preliminary mapping, RACI code explanations, and post-matrix justifications, which constitute unwarranted content not present in the ground truth.
- **Partial matches only**: Headers include abbreviations in parentheses (unneeded); Rs match exactly, but this is insufficient given the holistic differences.

These errors, even if rooted in a simplified interpretation of the narrative, result in a matrix that does not reflect the expected comprehensive RACI structure, leading to substantial point deduction for inaccuracy and extraneous material.
