5.0

- **Strict Adherence to Vocabulary Policy**: Fully satisfied. The LLM correctly uses “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, and “Payment Clearance” exclusively, never mentioning the forbidden terms; exact spellings and capitalization are maintained.

- **RACI Allocations**: This is the major source of point loss.
  - The LLM answer assigns both R and A (Responsible and Accountable) to a single role for each activity and leaves the rest blank, *except* for an appropriate Responsible/Accountable for the role performing the action.
  - The ground truth contains more nuanced RACI assignments: 
      - Many activities have C (Consulted) and I (Informed) roles assigned in addition to R/A. 
      - For example, "Receive Application" gives C to Compliance Officer, and I to Finance Clerk and IT Support.
      - "KYC Review" gives A to AM, C to FC, I to IT, etc.
      - The LLM omits these, only giving dual R/A to the main actor and leaving others blank.
      - This is a significant deviation: the ground truth expects a full RACI assignment with clear communication, consultation, and information flows—critical in real process-mapping context.

- **Matrix Format and Activities**: All six activities are present, and roles as columns are consistent.

- **Unwarranted Content**: No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced.

- **Explanation and Rationale**: The LLM provides a reasoning section, which is clear but does not make up for the factual inaccuracy regarding RACI allocation.

- **Score Justification**: 
    - Vocabulary and activities: +2
    - Matrix structure adherence: +1
    - No extra/unwarranted content: +1
    - Major penalization for missing C/I assignments per ground truth: -5

**Final: 5.0/10** — The answer respects the strict vocabulary policy and includes all required activities, but severely fails to replicate the ground truth RACI allocations, omitting essential Consulted and Informed assignments and failing to reflect process-mapping best practices expected in a professional setting.
