**9.2**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" with a valid, minimal concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 firing before T3, complete with precise markings in a clear table, accurate enabling conditions (p3=1, p4=0), and brief justification focused on the inhibitor arc and independent enabling of T3/T5. This fully satisfies the prompt requirements without errors.

### Key matches to ground truth (+ points):
- Core answer: Yes, T5 before T3 possible.
- Identical critical sequence steps 0-3 (initial → T1 → T2 → T5), same markings, same justification rationale (p3 enabled, p4=0 inhibitor satisfied, T3 not yet fired).
- Brief proof via reachable marking after T2.

### Strict deductions for differences (-0.8 total):
- **Wording/content depth (-0.3)**: LLM says "can fire before"; ground truth adds "and indeed must... if it is ever to occur" with analysis of permanent disablement post-T3 (true insight, but unrequired for prompt).
- **Sequence presentation/completeness (-0.3)**: LLM uses detailed table, stops correctly at T5 (sufficient); ground truth uses abbreviated list, extends unnecessarily to invalid T4 firing (p3=0 post-T5 prevents T4 despite p4=1, minor ground truth flaw unnoticed by LLM).
- **Explanation style (-0.2)**: LLM emphasizes choice ("we may choose to fire T5 now") and T3 independence; ground truth focuses on necessity and p4 semantics. Minor phrasing variances (e.g., "p3>0" vs. "≥1", negligible in safe net).

No factual errors, overkill, or omissions in LLM; high fidelity despite stylistic/presentation differences. Stricter penalty avoided as LLM avoids ground truth's sequence invalidity and sticks precisely to prompt.
