The LLM answer correctly identifies the core differences (added tasks: check_vip and generate_qr; removed: send_rma_label; gateway change for gw_valid from exclusive to inclusive), but loses significant points for multiple strict violations: (1) Uses only task IDs instead of exact element names (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" with ID), as shown in ground truth and XML name attributes; (2) Includes forbidden speculation (e.g., commentary on sequence flows and "traffic-wise" analysis); (3) Adds irrelevant structure (intro summary, incomplete markdown repetition, and nonsensical \boxed{BPMN_v2}); (4) Minor formatting deviations (e.g., bullet styles, lack of version specifics in gateway description); (5) No note on "no other differences," per ground truth. These errors compound to show incomplete adherence to the prompt's exact requirements.
