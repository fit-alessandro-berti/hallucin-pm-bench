9.2

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth, presenting all required changes under the exact requested headings, and listing the correct tasks and the gateway-type change. However, there are *very* minor deviations in the way the gateway-type change is phrased (it gives the XML tag names and id, rather than a more descriptive text as in the ground truth, e.g., "Gateway_Decision changed from exclusive (XOR) in v1 to inclusive (OR) in v2"). Also, the LLM answer formats task entries as "Task_ID (Task Name)" instead of "**Task Name** (`Task_ID`)", which is a minor presentation difference.

Additionally, it does not explain or clarify that the other tasks present are unchanged (though the ground truth includes a parenthetical clarifying this). 

Given the instructions to be "utmost strict" and penalize even small errors significantly, but considering that all meaningful content is correct and the answer is strictly grouped, these presentational and minor explanatory differences deduct ~0.8 points. 

Final score: **9.2**
