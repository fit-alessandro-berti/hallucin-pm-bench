6.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel in Process B. However, it makes two significant formatting errors relative to the very explicit requirements of the prompt and ground truth:

1. **Pair Formatting**: The pairs are output as `Create_Documentation — Quality_Check` and `Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines`—that is, without the required double space padding on either side of the em dash (—), as evidenced in the ground truth (which uses exactly two spaces before and after the dash).

2. **Output Alignment**: The answer does not align the em dashes as the ground truth does, with padding to ensure visual alignment.

3. **Order within pairs**: The pairs themselves are output in the correct overall order (alphabetical by first task), and task order within the pairs is also correct (alphabetical order: Create_Documentation then Quality_Check, Procure_Materials then Schedule_Machines).

While the logical content is 100% correct, the absolute strictness requested for **even small errors** must be respected. Since the required answer format is not followed exactly—particularly the two spaces around the em dash and the visual alignment—the answer must lose substantial points, despite the correctness of its selections. 

Therefore, a score of **6.0** is appropriate—crediting the correct logic, but significantly penalizing the formatting and not strictly following the user's requested answer specification.
