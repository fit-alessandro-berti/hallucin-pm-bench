The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two pairs from Process B that can execute in parallel, in the required alphabetical order both within pairs and in the list, using the correct task names with underscores. The content matches the ground truth perfectly, with no additions, omissions, or errors in logic. However, under utmost strictness, there are minor formatting differences: the LLM uses single spaces around the em dash (â€”) per line, while the ground truth uses double spaces for alignment across lines (e.g., indenting the second pair to align the dashes). This small deviation in precise spacing and list alignment warrants a slight deduction, but the response is otherwise exemplary.
