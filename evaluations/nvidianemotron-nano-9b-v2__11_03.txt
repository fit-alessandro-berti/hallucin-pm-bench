The LLM answer identifies the correct three activities (matching the ground truth) and accurately quantifies throughput SLA exceedances for each, grounding those in the table data. However, it invents non-existent waiting time targets (e.g., Risk Review waiting vs. 300s target; Legal Approval waiting "exactly on target" at 600s; Credit Assessment waiting "under target"), violating the core instruction to avoid unprovided metricsâ€”this alone warrants major deduction under strict evaluation. Structure deviates: it uses bullet-like dashes for activity descriptions (prompt specifies bullets *only* for recommendations), lacks a full header (To/From/Subject as in ground truth), and omits total cases or projections. Recommendations are concrete but less data-driven and specific than the ground truth's (e.g., no ties to case volumes, risk levels, or quantifiable projections like 35% cycle time reduction), introducing vague actions like "parallel processing" without table grounding. Overall, core matches are offset by multiple factual inventions and structural errors, leading to low alignment.
