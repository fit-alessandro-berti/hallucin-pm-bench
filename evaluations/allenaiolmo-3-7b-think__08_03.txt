**4.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies "yes" and the key shortcut path via T2b to enable T5 without prior T3, providing a valid prefix sequence (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5) with accurate step-by-step markings up to that point. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs **major deductions** for:

- **Incomplete/wrong sequence**: Provides only 4 steps where T3 *never fires*, failing to demonstrate "T5 before T3" (requires both in sequence with order). Ground truth correctly gives full minimal sequence of 6 (T1, T2b, T4, T5, **T6, T3**) proving the order.
- **Factual errors in explanation**: Wrongly claims "`pc` ... is **never produced**" and "**T3 never fires**", ignoring T6 (pf → pc) feedback loop that enables T3 *after* T5. This misrepresents the net.
- **Wrong "shortest" claim**: Calls length-4 "shortest", but ground truth proves 6 is minimal for achieving the order (lower bound 4 for T5, +2 for post-T5 T3 via T6; detailed proof absent in LLM).
- **Missing details**: No per-step markings format, no proof of minimality, no explanation of why T6/T3 enables post-T5 firing or shortcut's role fully.

These are substantial differences (not small errors), halving the score from a potential "yes + path" baseline.
