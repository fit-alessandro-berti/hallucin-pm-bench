8.5

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM answer correctly identifies both decision points and succinctly summarizes the rules behind each:
    - For the risk-based skip condition, it clearly outlines the risk and amount criteria, with a clear description.
    - For the TriVote, it accurately reports that two out of three approvals suffice for the loan to be approved.
- The language used is slightly more verbose than the ground truth ("The loan is approved if at least two out of three reviewers... approve it" versus "the loan may advance only when at least two of the three approvers... record 'Approve'."), but this is a minor wording difference, not a factual or structural error.
- It does not misstate any rules or omit any part of the conditional logic.

**b) List of Required Documents**

- The LLM’s list is in the correct order and matches the ground truth.
- No hallucinated documents are added.
- It explicitly includes all three scorecard documents, as required.

**Minor Flaws / Losses:**

- In the decision-point summaries, the LLM uses "the loan is approved" for TriVote, whereas technically, passing TriVote means the process *can* advance — "approved" could be construed as a slightly premature conclusion. However, this is arguably minimal and does not misconstrue the step sequence in context.
- The answer could be a touch more precise in mirroring the exact format and brevity of the ground-truth summary sentences.

**Conclusion:**
No factual/content errors, no omissions, minor deviation in phrasing of decision outcomes justifies a small but significant deduction (reflecting strictness). Therefore, 8.5 is appropriate for an otherwise nearly-perfect answer.
