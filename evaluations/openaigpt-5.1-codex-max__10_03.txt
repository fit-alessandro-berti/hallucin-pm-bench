**1.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +0.5)**: Correctly uses **Intake Vetting**, **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, **Risk Scoring** exactly; no disallowed terms leak. However, added activities ("Compliance Officer approval", "Schedule payment", "Release funds and notify originating analyst") use unauthorized phrasing/casing deviating from ground truth ("**Compliance Officer Approval**", "**Release Funds**").
- **Structure & Coverage (major deductions, -4.0)**: 7 rows vs. ground truth's 6; adds "Schedule payment" (merges/adds invalidly, violating "do not rename, merge, or add"); renames final activity; no bolding on activities/cells; "R/A" shorthand ≠ "**R, A**"; blanks ≠ "–".
- **RACI Accuracy (catastrophic failure, -4.3)**: Near-total mismatch across cells:
  | Activity | Key Mismatches |
  |----------|----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Misses CA=C, CO=–, TO=I |
  | KYC Review | Misses FOA=–, CO=C, TO=I |
  | AML Screening | Misses FOA=–, CO=C, TO=I |
  | Risk Scoring | Wrong: CA="R/A" (GT: R only), misses FOA=C, CO=**A**, TO=I |
  | Compliance Officer Approval | Misses FOA=I, TO=–; partial CA=C, CO="R/A" |
  | Extras ("Schedule payment", "Release...") | Non-existent in GT; wrong assignments (e.g., GT "Release Funds": CA=C/CO=C vs. I/I) |
- **Overall**: ~80% cell deviation; fails "every activity and role"; small errors (formatting/shorthand) compound massively. Unusable vs. ground truth.
