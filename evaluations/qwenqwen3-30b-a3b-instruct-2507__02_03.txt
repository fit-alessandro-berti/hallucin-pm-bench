- The LLM answer matches the ground truth on all points, with only minor formatting issues (lack of case count in A1 and not listing the actual case IDs). The answers to questions 2 and 3 are fully correct. This small omission in A1 should reflect in a minor loss of points, given the instruction for utmost strictness.
