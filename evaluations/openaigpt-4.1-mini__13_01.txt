9.0

1. The LLM answer accurately states that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time, matching the ground truth.

2. The LLM gives the correct calculation and percentage (1/18 × 100 = 5.56%), which matches the ground truth's value and calculation.

3. The LLM correctly identifies only case A1002 contains the activity, as in the ground truth.

4. The LLM gives two correct sampling-related reasons: (a) fragment covers a single day, and (b) only 4 cases (small sample size). Both are appropriate selections from the correct list in the ground truth.

Minor deviation: The LLM writes “the fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01)...” rather than using the phrase “temporal bias.” However, it is clear and grounded in the log data, and corresponds to the same reasoning point. Similarly, for small sample size, the copy is accurate. The calculation is presented both as a rounded floating number and as a calculation, exactly as in the ground truth.

All information is derived directly from the log; no hallucinatory or unjustified inferences are present.

Because the LLM answer is correct in substance and calculations, and only marginally less concise/structured than the ground truth, a slight deduction is merited for not using the explicit technical term “temporal bias,” but otherwise is maximally faithful and accurate.

Final strict score: **9.0**
