The LLM answer perfectly identifies and lists the two correct concurrent task sets in the exact order, using proper numbering and no extraneous information about other processes, fully complying with the prompt. Task names match precisely (including underscores). Minor deductions for formatting differences: comma separators instead of ‖ (less visually indicative of parallelism), absence of descriptive labels ("Set 1 – first parallel block"), backticks, bolding, and the confirmatory final sentence—stylistic variances under utmost strictness, but content is semantically identical with no factual errors.
