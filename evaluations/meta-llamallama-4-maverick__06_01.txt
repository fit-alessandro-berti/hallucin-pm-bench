The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines and Create_Documentation — Quality_Check), with no additions or omissions. Alphabetical ordering is accurate both within pairs (C before Q; P before S) and overall (C pair before P pair). Content matches the ground truth rationale perfectly, confirming these are the only pairs with explicit parallelism and no unintended overlaps inferred.

Minor deduction for including unnecessary explanatory text before the required output format (prompt specifies "Output one pair per line" without requesting reasoning), which deviates slightly from the minimal expected response structure. The code-blocked output itself has near-identical formatting to the ground truth, with only trivial spacing inconsistencies in rendering (e.g., alignment of dashes), but these are negligible under strict evaluation.
