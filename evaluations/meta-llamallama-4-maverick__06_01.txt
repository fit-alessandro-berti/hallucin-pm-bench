9.0

The LLM answer is nearly perfect with only a very minor deviation: the spacing between "Procure_Materials" and "—" is just a single space, whereas the ground truth uses multiple spaces to align the dashes vertically. There are no content or ordering mistakes—the answer lists exactly the correct pairs, correctly alphabetized both at the pair level and overall, and the explanatory reasoning is precise. However, per the instruction to grade with utmost strictness and count even small errors, the output format isn't a character-for-character match to the required formatting in the ground truth (which uses additional spaces for alignment). This warrants a deduction, so I assign a score of 9.0.
