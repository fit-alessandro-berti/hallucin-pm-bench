The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3) and quotes the exact average and 95th-percentile figures from the table. It adheres to the ≤150-word limit (approximately 120 words), avoids any discussion of service times, throughput, or extraneous activities, and provides one concrete, logically relevant, data-driven action per activity, each promising a ≥20% reduction without unsupported inventions. Minor deductions for format deviations (full memo header vs. ground truth's abbreviated list) and differing action specifics (e.g., automated portal/escalation vs. ground truth's reminders/escalation; same-day letters vs. e-signature replacement; pre-assignment dashboard vs. rules-engine pre-classification), which introduce non-identical phrasing and recommendations despite meeting all criteria.
