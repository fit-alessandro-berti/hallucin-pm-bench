3.5

The LLM answer diverges significantly from the ground truth in several key aspects, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Major differences include: (1) proposing three boundary timers (on Task_Receive, Task_Check, Task_RequestDocs) instead of one (only on Task_Receive); (2) using a complex timeDate expression referencing processStartTime(Start_Claim) + PT48H, rather than the simple <bpmn:timeDuration>PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration; (3) lacking specific XML-like details or an assigned ID (e.g., "Timer_48h") for the timer and new flow; (4) not explicitly mentioning bypassing "outstanding document requests" as a targeted outcome. While the LLM achieves the SLA goal conceptually and stays within word limits, these structural and specificity mismatches indicate substantial deviation, resulting in major point loss. Minor positives (e.g., referencing relevant IDs, plain English) prevent a floor score.
