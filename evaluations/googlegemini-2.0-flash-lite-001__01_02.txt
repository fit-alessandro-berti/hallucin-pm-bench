8.2

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, faithfully summarizing the decision points using exact activity names from the prompt (no introduction of standard loan terminology) and listing all required documents verbatim from the prompt. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth warrant point deductions:

- **Decision Points (deduction of 1.2 points)**: 
  - Core content matches (three key decisions, precise thresholds like "≤ 2" implied in LLM's "more than 2 points" inversion, amount split, and MBA voting), but omits contextual details for completeness: no mention of "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" for the Underwriter Alignment Gate, nor "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" for the Amount Threshold Decision. Phrasing also differs slightly (e.g., LLM uses "auto-approve" without "system"; "proceed to" vs. ground truth's "send to"; lowercase "approve/reject" vs. bolded/capitalized **Approve**/**Reject**). Structure uses bullets without the ground truth's descriptive branches (e.g., "⇒ continue; else ⇒ escalate").

- **Required Documents (deduction of 0.6 points)**:
  - List is complete and matches the prompt exactly (no omissions or additions), but minor phrasing variances: "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. ground truth's shortened "(≤ 3 months)"; "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. ground truth's condensed "(pay-stub/tax slip)"; "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" includes extra "template" not in ground truth's "(CIS)". Uses bullets instead of numbered list. Notably, omits the ground truth's parenthetical note emphasizing "(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)", which reinforces the prompt's non-standard focus.

These omissions and phrasing tweaks reduce fidelity, though the response remains concise, on-topic, and error-free in substance. A perfect 10.0 requires identical structure, phrasing, and inclusions to the ground truth.
