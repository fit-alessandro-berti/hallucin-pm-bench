8.0

The LLM answer is generally correct, but there are several notable issues, especially when judged with "utmost strictness":

**Strengths:**
- Decision points and required documents are mostly accurate and correspond in content to those in the ground truth.
- Exact activity names (especially for documents) are preserved.
- No extraneous document is introduced.

**Deficiencies and Strictness Deductions:**
- The LLM answer omits the placement of the decision points in relation to process steps (e.g. fails to say "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which is more precise in the ground truth.
- It fails to note specifically that the Underwriter Alignment Gate happens after the Dual Underwriter Split or that the Amount Threshold Decision happens after the Neighbourhood Feedback Check.
- The LLM answer does not explicitly state that the Harmonisation Committee makes a "tie-break decision, then continue", as per the prompt (this is implicit, but not stated).
- The answer does not mention, as the ground truth does, that no credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard documents are needed.
- The phrase "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" instead of just "CIS" is a minor terminology deviation.
- The CIS description is "template" vs "Community Impact Statement (CIS)"â€”this is a slight mis-specification, as ground truth does not specify "template".
- For the "Latest Income Statement," the LLM specifies "(single pay-stub or tax slip)", which is essentially correct, but the ground truth says just "(pay-stub/tax slip)". The addition of "single" is not required but is not a significant error.

**Conclusion:**
Small deviations from precise process placement, less explicit detail about the Harmonisation Committee, and minor terminology drift result in roughly a 2.0 point deduction for strict grading.

**Score: 8.0**
