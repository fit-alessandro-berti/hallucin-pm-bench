The LLM answer correctly identifies the impossibility of calculation due to missing time data and remains concise, but loses a full point for minor phrasing differences (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute"; "time duration data for the transition" vs. explicit mention of "start-to-completion intervals") that do not perfectly align with the ground truth under strict evaluation.
