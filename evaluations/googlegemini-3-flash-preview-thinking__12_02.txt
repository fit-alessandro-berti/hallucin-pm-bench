The LLM answer correctly identifies "No" and provides a one-paragraph justification citing the exact same two counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11) as the ground truth, accurately disproving the "always follows" claim with precise case and line references. Minor deductions for: (1) unnecessary inclusion of timestamps (not required by prompt and absent in ground truth, adding extraneous detail); (2) phrasing like "corresponding Receive_Order activity appearing earlier in the case sequence" and "independently of or before a recorded order receipt" which is correct but less concise/direct than ground truth's "never contains Receive_Order at all" and explicit "does not always follow"; (3) informal "order receipt" instead of consistent activity name. These are small stylistic/precision issues under utmost strictness but do not introduce factual errors.
