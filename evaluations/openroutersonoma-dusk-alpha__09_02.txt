The LLM answer is nearly identical in intent and conciseness to the ground truth, correctly identifying the impossibility due to missing timestamps and adhering to the prompt's requirement for a single explanatory sentence. The minor differences in phrasing (e.g., "cannot be determined" vs. "impossible to compute," and slightly less detail on event counts and intervals) are stylistic rather than substantive, warranting only a small deduction under strict evaluation.
