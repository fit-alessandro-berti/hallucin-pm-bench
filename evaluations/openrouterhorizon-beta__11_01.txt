6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (activities, ranking, metrics)**: Fully accurate. The three worst activities are correctly identified and ranked by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1 at 36.5h avg/120.0h p95; Send_Closure_Letter #2 at 12.2h/44.0h; Assess_Liability #3 at 7.8h/16.4h). All waiting-time figures are quoted verbatim from the table, with no service-time or throughput mentions.
- **Structure and Conciseness**: Memo format is crisp and under 150 words (~120 words excluding notes), with clear ranking and one action per activity. However, the added header (To/Subject) deviates from the ground truth's direct listing style, introducing minor unnecessary formality.
- **Actions**: Concrete and logically tied to waiting times, with data-driven elements (e.g., A/B tests, pilots, expected reductions ≥20%). They promise the required ≥20% cut without fabricating unsupported data, aligning well in intent but differing in specifics from ground truth (e.g., reminders/escalations vs. automated reminders; event-driven dispatch vs. e-signature replacement).
- **Unwarranted Content**: Significant deduction here—the "Notes" section explicitly discusses other activities (e.g., Initial_Screening, Approve_Payment) with their waiting times, violating the prompt's focus on only the three worst and the ground truth's explicit rule to "mention only these three activities." This adds irrelevant details, bloating the response beyond a pure executive memo.
- **Overall**: Strong core compliance but penalized strictly for the extraneous notes (a clear rule break, warranting ~3-point loss) and format/action phrasing differences (minor, ~0.5-point loss each). No criminal/jailbreak issues.
