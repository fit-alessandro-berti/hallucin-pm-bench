**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Decision points (major mismatches, ~50% of task weight; severe deductions)**:
  - #1: LLM vaguely describes "evaluates... to decide if meets basic criteria" without explicit branching logic/outcomes (*Eligible → continue; Not eligible → rejected*). Misses "claim rejected/returned." Uses "external data" instead of specific *FlightManifest*/*WeatherReport*. Renames to "Eligibility Validation (Triage)" vs. ground truth's precise "*Eligibility check* during **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**." Significant inaccuracy.
  - #2: Mostly matches (threshold after pre-approval, correct branches), minor wording ok. No deduction.
  - #3: **Critical error** – Introduces undefined "Payment Authorization" as a "final verification... within the finance team," implying a new decision/activity not in process (violates "Do not introduce any activities"). Ground truth correctly attributes to defined **Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review** with *Approved → payment; Rejected → ends*. LLM misplaces/expands into *Process_Refund_Payment* precondition as separate "decision."
  - Structure: Informal list vs. ground truth's precise table with columns (#, point, logic/outcomes). No bolded activity names.
  - Overall: Misses/invents key details; only 1/3 fully accurate.

- **Required documents (minor strengths, ~50% weight; partial credit)**:
  - Lists all 7 exactly (*RefundRequestForm*, *FlightManifest*, *WeatherReport*, *EligibilityChecklist*, *AuditTrail*, *BankTransferAuthorization*, *RefundConfirmationPDF*).
  - Correctly notes *AuditTrail* conditional/high-value (matches "only for >€1000, part of catalogue").
  - Minor extras: Unasked descriptions ("Used by...", "Completed by..."); counts "seven (7)"; no closing note "(No other documents or legacy...)." Still close, but adds unrequested content.

- **General strictness penalties**:
  - ~30% content divergence (inaccurate/invented decision #1/#3).
  - Format/precision gaps (no table, loose naming).
  - Inferences border on introducing undefined elements (e.g., "logical gateway," "final verification").
  - No adherence to ground truth's structure/wording despite "summarise every decision point and list all."

Total reflects strict rubric: perfect documents offset partial decisions, but errors in half the task + rule violations drop below 5.
