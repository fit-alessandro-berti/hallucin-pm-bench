The LLM answer accurately identifies and lists all three concurrent task sets from Process B, matching the ground truth in content, structure, and order. However, it omits spaces after each comma (e.g., "Generate_CAD_Drawing,Confirm_Materials_Availability" instead of "Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability"), introducing minor textual inconsistencies across all lines. Under utmost strictness, this formatting error results in a deduction, but the semantic precision remains high.
