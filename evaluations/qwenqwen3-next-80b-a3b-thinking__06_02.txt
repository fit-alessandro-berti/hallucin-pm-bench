9.0

The LLM answer matches the ground truth in content—listing exactly the same sets of concurrent tasks per parallel block. However, it omits the space after the comma separating tasks in each line (“Generate_CAD_Drawing,Confirm_Materials_Availability” instead of “Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability”), which is a small but clear formatting error. As per strict grading, this warrants a notable point deduction, resulting in a 9.0. The information and sequence are otherwise correct.
