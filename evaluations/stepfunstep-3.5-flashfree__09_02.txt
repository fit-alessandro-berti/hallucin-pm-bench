The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifying the impossibility due to absent timestamps/duration data in a single concise sentence as required. Minor deductions for: (1) slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., "supplied data lacks... making it impossible" vs. direct "It is impossible... because"); (2) omission of "only event counts" and explicit "start-to-completion intervals absent," which add clarifying detail in the ground truth without exceeding conciseness.
