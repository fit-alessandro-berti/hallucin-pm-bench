10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth across all questions, with no deviations, hallucinations, or unjustified inferences. Question 1 correctly identifies the count as 1. Question 2 accurately computes and rounds to 5.56%. Question 3 properly lists the single case (A1002), aligning with the ground truth's phrasing and intent despite minor singular/plural wording variation in the prompt. Question 4 provides two valid, clearly stated sampling-related reasons (temporal bias and small sample size) that directly correspond to the ground truth examples, with explanations emphasizing unreliability without exceeding the log data.
