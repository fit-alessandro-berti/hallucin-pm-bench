9.5

1. The LLM answer for question 1 is correct: "1 time" (matches "1 occurrence").
2. The answer for question 2 is correct: "5.56%" with the correct calculation shown in both the model answer and the ground truth.
3. Question 3 is answered correctly: case "A1002".
4. For question 4, the LLM provides "Temporal bias" and "Sample size." Both are included in the acceptable sampling-related issues in the ground truth (“Temporal bias” and “Small sample size”), and their explanations are consistent with the ground-truth guidance.

The only minor issue is the answer to #4 could have mentioned more explicitly that "small dataset" refers to "cases" or "case-mix," but the overall explanation is clear, and "sample size" and "temporal bias" are direct matches to acceptable answers from the rubric.

There are no additional or unsupported assumptions, and there is no hallucination. However, according to the strictest standards mentioned in your instructions, the answer could have been more precise in the rationale for the small sample size (mentioning cases or indicating sensitivity to single events), as seen in the ground truth. This is a very small stylistic gap, not a substantive one.

Thus, I deduct 0.5 points for not stating explicitly that the sample size refers to "cases" and for not quantifying the sensitivity of the statistic (which the ground truth does: "a single extra occurrence would change the percentage by ±5.56 pp"). Otherwise, this is a near-perfect answer.

Final score: **9.5**
