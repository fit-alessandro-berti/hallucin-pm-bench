The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth by correctly identifying the impossibility of computations due to redacted data (headers only, no timestamps or events), addressing all task elements (average, std dev, CI, and precise reason), and emphasizing the absence of necessary "Approve Invoice" specifics. Minor deductions for slight phrasing variations (e.g., "event-duration data" vs. explicit "start_time / complete_time" timestamps; structured numbering vs. single paragraph) and adding "complete case-level information" (not precisely mirrored), which introduce negligible but detectable differences under strict evaluation.
