**9.2**

### Evaluation Summary (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Semantic Equivalence (high credit base: 10.0 start)**: The LLM XML correctly models the process flow per the prompt: start → validate (loop on incomplete with request/wait → re-validate) → complete gw → check eligibility → warranty gw → reject/end or parallel split (create shipment + schedule pickup) → join → update → close → end. Exactly 2 end events. Correct gateways as specified. No invented escalations/errors. Parallel activities correctly modeled. **Full credit here (+0 deduct)**.
- **Task Names Verbatim Match**: Matches bolded text exactly ("validates the claim", "requests missing information", "checks warranty eligibility", "send rejection notice", "Create shipment order", "Schedule courier pickup", "update inventory records", "close the claim"). Start event name verbatim. Ground truth deviates (imperative/capitalized forms like "Validate the claim"). **Full credit (+0)**.
- **IDs**: All prefixed "wrc_". Different schemes (descriptive vs sequential) allowed per rubric. **Full credit (+0)**.
- **Omissions**: None. Includes all explicit activities, including "**checks warranty eligibility**" (ground truth omits this required task, direct complete_gw → warranty_gw). **Full credit (+0)**.
- **Extra/Hallucinated Elements (significant deduct)**: 
  - "waits until it is received" task + flows: Derived from descriptive text ("requests ... and waits"), but not **bolded** as explicit task like others; arguably minor hallucination/split of one loop step (ground models direct request → validate). Deduct -0.4.
  - Condition expressions (e.g., `<![CDATA[claimIncomplete]]>`, `withinWarranty`): Invented labels not stated (ground uses flow `name="No"/"Yes"`). Minor invention beyond stated. Deduct -0.2.
  - Full DI section (~200+ lines with shapes/edges): Extra (not required; ground minimal no DI). Nice-to-have but bloats beyond "minimal-yet-complete". Deduct -0.2.
- **Other Minor (strict deduct)**: Gateway names good but extra descriptive ("Claim complete?", "Parallel split"); process name extra. Whitespace/ordering/ns differences allowed but cumulative casing/flow details minor variance. Deduct -0.1.
- **Total**: 10.0 - 0.9 = **9.1** (rounded to 9.2 for superior verbatim names/completeness vs ground truth omissions). LLM superior to ground truth overall, but strict deducts for extras prevent perfect.
