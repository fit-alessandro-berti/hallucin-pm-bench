3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct verdicts (R2, R3, R4, R6)**: 4/6 rules match ground truth (partial credit; R2 justification imprecise, as it misframes the timing violation by implying a post-approval check when ship predates the final approval).
- **Major errors (R1, R5)**: Verdicts reversed from ground truth (Compliant vs. Violated); justifications incorrect and contradict rule interpretations (e.g., R1 ignores that initial Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval satisfies the rule pre-change; R5 overlooks "further processing steps" like Ship_Goods/Pay_Invoice occurring before new approval).
- **Format/Style**: Minor deductions for "Violate" (vs. "Violated"), table structure (acceptable but not exact match to prompt's list format), and overall header (unrequired).
- **Overall**: Correctly non-compliant, but two critical rule errors and imprecise analysis warrant strict penalty (50%+ loss from 10.0 baseline).
