8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies **all factual changes** matching the ground truth: added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, and `gw_valid` type change from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`. No incorrect items or speculation.

**Strengths (high score basis)**:
- Exact element IDs from XML.
- Correct categories with no extras or misses.
- Concise, factual phrasing per prompt ("only the factual differences").

**Weaknesses (deductions)**:
- Uses only IDs, omitting task `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status"), which ground truth includes as primary descriptors with `(id = ...)`. This is a content omission (~1.0 deduction).
- Headings formatted as markdown lists (`* Added tasks`) rather than bold (`**Added tasks**`) or exact `• Added tasks`. Minor but visible difference (~0.3 deduction).
- Gateway phrasing shorter/misses "(v1)" and "(v2)" and exact wording "changed from ... to" (~0.2 deduction).

Strict grading applied: perfect facts = base 10.0; content/format diffs = -1.5 total. No other errors (e.g., no hallucinated changes, correct "none" handling N/A).
