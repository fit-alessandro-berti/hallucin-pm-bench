**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Correct overall verdict**: +2.0 (both identify "Non-compliant").
- **Major flaws in completeness**: -3.0 (Misses **Rule 2 violation** entirely — `Risk_Assessment` (9) after `Ship_Goods` (8) despite `Expedite_Flag` (4); ground truth explicitly flags this as reversed order. Fails to assess **all rules** as ground truth does with numbered 1-5 breakdown, citing only "relevant" ones per format but incompletely).
- **Factual errors in cited rule**: -2.0 (Rule 3: Claims "**four** subsequent activities" listing #7-10, incorrectly including `Three_way_match` (#10) itself; actual intervening activities are three (#7-9, distance=3 per ground truth), sloppy and wrong).
- **Structural/Format issues**: -1.0 (Lacks comprehensive numbered justification mirroring ground truth's rule-by-rule analysis; prompt requires "numbered justification that cites the relevant rules," but LLM is minimal/single-rule only).
- **No credit for unmentioned satisfied rules**: 0.0 (Strictness: ground truth verifies Rules 1,4,5 explicitly; omission implies unverified).

Total reflects partial credit for verdict but heavy penalties for incompleteness, errors, and lack of thoroughness (far from ground truth).
