**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major flaw (target of timeout flow, -5.0+ points)**: LLM routes boundary event to `End_Rejected` (immediate rejection), ignoring the explicitly commented "*Unused but existing escalation activity*" (`Activity_AMReview`) and failing to create an "escalation path" as referenced in the business context. Ground truth correctly routes to `Activity_AMReview` (`Flow_LateEscalation` sourceRef="Boundary_LateCreate" targetRef="Activity_AMReview"`), utilizing the pre-existing task without adding new activities.
- **Medium flaw (timer duration notation, -1.5 points)**: LLM uses `P2D` (2 calendar days, imprecise for exactly 48 hours); ground truth uses precise `PT48H`. BPMN favors explicit durations like PT48H for SLAs.
- **Small flaws (-1.0 total)**: Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `timeDuration` (required for formal expressions in BPMN 2.0); different IDs/names/comments; justification generic and omits "pre-existing **Account-Manager Review**" and "without introducing any new activities" phrasing.
- **Partial matches (+0.5)**: Correctly adds interrupting boundary timer on `Activity_CreateAccount`; one-sentence justification format; no new activities added.
- **Overall**: Fundamentally deviates from ground truth's escalation-focused solution, violating "utmost strictness" on differences. Equivalent technical validity doesn't excuse mismatches.
