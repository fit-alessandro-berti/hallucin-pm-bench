The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Create_Documentation — Quality_Check and Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified one-pair-per-line format. However, it includes an unnecessary introductory sentence, lacks the exact spacing/alignment in the second pair (e.g., no padding spaces for alignment as in ground truth), and omits the explanatory rationale present in the ground truth. These deviations from the precise output format and structure warrant a deduction, though the core content is accurate and complete.
