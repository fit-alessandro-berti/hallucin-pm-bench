7.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel in Process B, and outputs them, one per line. However, there are errors concerning formatting:

- The pairs are not formatted with the required double-space alignment around the em-dash (i.e., not `Task_X  —  Task_Y` but e.g. `Create_Documentation — Quality_Check` with single spaces and a regular dash). 
- There is no code block or clear monospaced formatting: the ground truth presented the pairs in a clearly formatted code block maintaining column alignment between left and right tasks; the LLM answer dropped this.
- "Alphabetical order within each pair" is maintained, but the "overall list" is only correct incidentally (since the pairs themselves are already alphabetically sorted).
- The LLM also adds an unnecessary introductory explanatory sentence, which is not instructed or wanted.

These small but significant formatting/precision issues are grounds for notable point deduction. The factual content is, however, entirely correct and complete. Therefore, a strict but fair score is 7.0.
