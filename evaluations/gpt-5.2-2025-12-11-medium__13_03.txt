**8.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (40% weight)**: Exact match ("1 time"), precise and correct. Full points.
- **Q2 (60% weight)**: Strong on core ideas (tiny sample of 3 cases/small events = non-representative; naming inconsistencies with exact examples like “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”). Under 120 words (~105). However, strict deductions for omissions/mismatches vs. ground truth:
  - Misses key quantifications: 14 total events, <2-hour span, frequency swing (0%→7%), wide confidence interval, rare-event sampling error.
  - No specific location (case 1002, 09:07:13).
  - Slight speculation drift: "if full log contains additional naming variants" (ground truth sticks to snippet's existing variants + strict/fuzzy risks).
  - Less statistical rigor (no % or interval); good but not "senior analyst" depth.

Total reflects ~82% alignment; strict per instructions.
