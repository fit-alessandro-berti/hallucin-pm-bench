The LLM answer is exceptionally aligned with the ground truth in core reasoning (impossibility due to absent temporal data) and conclusion, with no factual errors or fabrications. Minor differences include slightly more elaboration on historical benchmarks (accurate but not in ground truth) and phrasing variations ("derived" vs. "computed"; "lacks timestamps or elapsed-time data" vs. "lacks any timestamps, durations or ordering information"), which introduce negligible divergence under strict evaluation but do not warrant deep point loss given the overall fidelity.
