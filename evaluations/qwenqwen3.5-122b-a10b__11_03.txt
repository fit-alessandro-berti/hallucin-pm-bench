**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst-performing jointly on SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s). Accurately quantifies all breaches using Avg_Throughput_Time vs. Target_SLA. Proper memo structure with bullet points *only* for recommendations. Grounds all claims in table data (no invented metrics/activities). Word count ≈150. No extraneous content.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: 
  - Headers/subject differ (e.g., "From" mismatches prompt persona slightly vs. GT; bland subject lacks specificity like "Loan-Origination" or sample period).
  - Intro omits total cases (~4805 per GT) and "queues" framing; vaguely ties to "throughput data" instead of joint wait/SLA emphasis.
  - Activity descriptions include cases (not in GT) but rephrase awkwardly (e.g., "recording 900 seconds throughput").
  - Recommendations differ entirely: LLM's are numeric but generic/vague ("increase capacity", "reduce throughput") and one inaccurate (Risk Review: -180s wait → throughput 420s >300s SLA, fails "align"). GT's are concrete/process-specific despite inventing ungrounded details (e.g., "€25k"). Closing invents ungrounded benefits (no data for "restore compliance").
  - Minor: Asterisks vs. bullets; no bolding/formatting; Risk rec misaligns data logic (-1.8 pts deduction).
- **Overall**: Core facts match (80% alignment), but stylistic/content diffs (recs, framing) and small errors warrant deduction from 10.0.
