9.5

The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth and accurately identifies compliance status ("Non-compliant") and the justification for each rule. The LLM:

- Correctly identifies violations of Rule 2 and Rule 3, accurately citing the activities and their positions.
- Correctly finds Rules 1, 4, and 5 to be satisfied, with suitable justifications.
- Properly numbers and cites the rules involved.

The only (very minor) difference is phrasing:
- The LLM answer omits the word "Justification" as a header.
- The explanations are slightly more concise and not as formally structured as the ground truth (e.g., not using **bold** rule labels).
- LLM directly lists rules by number rather than using a heading with rule and outcome (e.g., "Rule 1 — Satisfied").

These are negligible issues but, per your request for strictness—with "even small errors should reflect in significant loss of points"—the absence of clearly labeled justification headers and formalism (such as explicit "Justification" and bold text for rules) constitutes a very small deduction.

Final score: **9.5**
