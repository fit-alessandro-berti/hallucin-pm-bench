**10.0**

The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in conclusion ("No"), case analysis (all four cases correctly identified with sequences and violations in C002/C004), citation of evidence (CaseIDs and exact intervening activities), and reasoning ("always" disproven by counterexamples). Stylistic differences (e.g., table columns, arrows vs. text, emojis, phrasing like "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate") are superficial and do not alter content, structure, or adherence to the task—no errors or omissions. Perfect match under strict evaluation.
