7.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment vs. ground truth):
- **Decision Points (major partial match, -1.8 total)**:
  - Correctly identifies all 3 decision points with accurate conditions and activity names (strong).
  - #1: Close but more verbose ("system compares", explicit NFC continue); GT is concise with "branch after Dual Underwriter Split" and ⇒ notation (-0.5).
  - #2: **Critical omission** – fails to specify "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)", distorting process flow/position; ordering implies direct sequence post-Alignment (-1.0).
  - #3: Minor diffs ("formal vote", lowercase "approve/reject" vs. **Approve**/**Reject**) (-0.3).
- **Required Documents (near match, -0.7 total)**:
  - Lists all 6 exactly, no extras/missing (strong).
  - Phrasing diffs: "must be ≤ 3 months old" (extra "must be", vs. GT "(≤ 3 months)") (-0.2); "single pay-stub or tax slip" (extra "single", "or" vs. "/") (-0.2); "(CIS) template" (extra "template", vs. GT "(CIS)") (-0.2); bullets vs. numbered (-0.1).
  - Missing GT's closing note (-0.0, optional but stylistic).
- **Overall Structure/Style (-0.3)**: Extra intro sentence, ### headers, verbose sub-bullets/*If* vs. GT's #### concise format with ⇒; no invention but deviates from GT brevity.
- **Strengths (+ full base)**: No factual errors, uses exact terminology, no standard loan terms introduced.
- **Strictness applied**: Significant deductions for flow omission (process integrity) and cumulative small phrasing/structure diffs (per instructions). Content fidelity high but not identical.
