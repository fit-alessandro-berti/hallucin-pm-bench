8.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the factual content of the ground truth precisely (Quality_Check with Update_Inventory; Generate_Replenishment_Report with Notify_Procurement). No extraneous information about Processes A or C is included, and the order is correct.

However, under utmost strictness:
- **-0.5**: Unnecessary introductory sentence ("Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment features two sets..."), which adds non-prescribed verbiage.
- **-0.5**: Formatting deviations—uses bold **Set 1**/**Set 2** with bullet lists instead of numbered list "1. **Set 1 – first parallel block:**" style; lacks descriptive phrases ("first parallel block", "second parallel block"), backticks for task names, and ‖ symbol for parallelism.
- **-0.5**: Missing confirmatory closing statement ("No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel."), which explicitly fulfills completeness despite being implicit in the prompt.

Core compliance with prompt (listing numbered sets of concurrent tasks from same parallel construct) is excellent, but stylistic and completeness mismatches deduct points.
