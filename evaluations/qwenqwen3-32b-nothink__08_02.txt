The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on Q1 (claims "No" when ground truth is "Yes") and provides a flawed explanation ignoring the T2-T7 path to P5 without T3. It fails Q2 by not providing a valid sequence, instead offering an invalid rationale. This constitutes a complete mismatch with the ground truth, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation.
