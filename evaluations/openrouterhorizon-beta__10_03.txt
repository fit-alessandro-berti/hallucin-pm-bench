4.5

The LLM answer demonstrates good effort in using the authorized vocabulary and maintaining the required activity names. However, there are several significant discrepancies compared to the ground truth, as detailed below:

**Vocabulary Compliance & Activity Naming:**
- All mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") are indeed used, with no synonyms present—this is a strong point.
- However, two unauthorized activities appear: "Schedule the payment", and "Notify the originating analyst." The prompt specifically commands not to add, merge, or rename activities; thus, these represent major policy breaches.

**Activity List Alignment:**
- The matrix contains eight activities, but the ground truth has only six (no "Schedule the payment" or "Notify the originating analyst", and combines "Release Funds"/notification). This is a severe process issue.

**RACI Assignments:**
- The Responsible (R) and Accountable (A) roles do not fully align with the ground truth:
    - The ground truth uses "R, A" for roles like "Intake Vetting" (Front-Office Analyst) and "KYC Review"/"AML Screening" (Compliance Analyst), whereas the LLM assigns only "R" or sometimes just "R" and never "R, A".
    - In "Risk Scoring", ground truth splits "R" (Compliance Analyst) and "A" (Compliance Officer); LLM assigns "R" to Compliance Analyst, "C" to Compliance Officer, never "A".
    - For "Compliance Officer approval", ground truth assigns "R, A" to Compliance Officer, but LLM shows "A/R".
    - “Release funds” incorrectly has C to Compliance Officer in both versions, but LLM splits into "Release the funds" and "Schedule the payment", mis-allocating A/R.

**Symbol Usage:**
- The dash (–) indicating no involvement is not used at all; instead, the LLM always puts I or leaves as blank, which is not process-compliant.

**Formatting:**
- The LLM does use Markdown tables correctly, as required.

**Overall:**
- No vocabulary errors, but the output is undermined by process compliance issues (adding/merging activities, not following strict role assignments, wrong usage of RACI markers). These are all serious issues.

**Conclusion:**  
Because the LLM refrains from forbidden vocabulary, the answer avoids the lowest marks, but the output fundamentally fails to comply strictly with process, activity naming, and RACI role assignments.

**Deduction summary:**  
- -4 points: For extra & merged activities.
- -0.5 point: RACI ("R, A" not used, dashes missing, "A/R" is not accepted format) and incorrect assignments.
- -1 point: Activity involvement not matching ground truth.

**Final Score:** 4.5
