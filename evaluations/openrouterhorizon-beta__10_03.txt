4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Positive, but minor weight)**: The LLM answer correctly uses only the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") exactly as specified, with no synonyms or leaks. This matches the ground truth and policy strictly (+1.0 point baseline).
- **Structure and Formatting**: Markdown table is used, but lacks bolding on activities and key RACI cells, uses combined "A/R" instead of separate "R, A", and omits dashes ("–") for no involvement (uses "I" incorrectly in places). Ground truth is more precise and standardized; these are small but strict-worthy errors (-0.5 points).
- **Activities Coverage (Major Deduction)**: Covers the four core activities correctly without renaming/merging. However, adds unauthorized extras ("Compliance Officer approval (for scores >70)", "Schedule the payment", "Notify the originating analyst") not in the ground truth, violating "do not add activities". Ground truth limits additions to two derived activities ("Compliance Officer Approval", "Release Funds"), interpreting the narrative conservatively. The extras and parenthetical detail inflate the scope incorrectly (-3.0 points).
- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction)**: Significant mismatches across all rows compared to ground truth, even for shared activities:
  - **Intake Vetting**: LLM (R/I/I/I) vs. GT (R,A/C/–/I) – Wrong: Misses A for Front-Office, uses I instead of C for Compliance Analyst and – for Officer (-1.0).
  - **KYC Review**: LLM (I/R/C/I) vs. GT (–/R,A/C/I) – Wrong: I vs. – for Front-Office; R vs. R,A for Compliance Analyst (-0.8).
  - **AML Screening**: LLM (I/R/C/I) vs. GT (–/R,A/C/I) – Identical errors to KYC (-0.8).
  - **Risk Scoring**: LLM (I/R/C/I) vs. GT (C/R/A/I) – Wrong: I vs. C for Front-Office; C vs. A for Officer (-0.8).
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Partial match (I/C/A-R/I) vs. GT (I/C/R,A/–), but I vs. – for Treasury Ops and combined A/R vs. separate (-0.5); still penalized as added/misnamed.
  - **Release Funds**: Partial (I/I/C/A-R) vs. GT (I/C/C/R,A) – Wrong: I vs. C for Compliance Analyst (-0.5).
  - Added rows ("Schedule", "Notify"): No ground truth equivalents, introducing unsupported RACI (-1.0).
- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt and Narrative**: Attempts to cover "every activity" but over-interprets by adding unsubstantiated rows (e.g., "Schedule" and "Notify" are mentioned but not distinctly matrixed in GT). Fails strict "do not add" rule, and RACI logic deviates (e.g., overuses "I" for non-involved roles, ignores accountability nuances). Strict evaluation demands near-exact match; cumulative errors (8+ differences) justify low score, but partial core accuracy prevents 1.0. Total: Starts at 5.0 baseline for table/vocab, deducts to 4.0.
