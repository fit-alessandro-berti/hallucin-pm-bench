The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content and intent across all questions: Q1 is identical (3); Q2 is identical in sequence and separators; Q3 lists the two correct distinct preceding activities (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock) one per line in alphabetical order, with no extras, omissions, or fabrications. Minor formatting differences (e.g., absence of dashes or <br> tags in Q3) do not impact factual precision and align with the prompt's "one per line" instruction.
