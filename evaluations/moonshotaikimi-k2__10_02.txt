3.5

**Justification:**

**Strengths:**
- The answer faithfully uses the mandated terms: “KYC Review,” “Regulatory Liaison,” and “Transaction Analyst.” Nowhere does it use forbidden vocabulary, which is critical.
- The answer breaks down most process steps accurately and matches them with the new vocabulary.
- Presents tasks in a Markdown table as required.

**Significant Issues:**
1. **Major Role Omission:** The answer completely omits the “Operations Manager” role, which is present in the ground truth answer (as “Accountable” on almost all tasks). This is a **critical error**; the instructions were to cover all roles per the ground truth, and its omission fundamentally alters role clarity and RACI logic.

2. **Incorrect RACI Assignments:**
   - In the ground truth, accountability **never sits with the same role as responsibility** (e.g., “Transaction Analyst” is responsible for several steps, but “Operations Manager” is accountable). In the LLM answer, “Responsible” and “Accountable” are usually given to the **same role**, contradicting best RACI practice and the ground truth.
   - Minimal use of “Consulted” and “Informed”; several “—” entries ignore the ground truth, which thoughtfully covers secondary and tertiary stakeholders. The ground truth designates “Consulted” and “Informed” far more precisely.
   - Step 5a (“Ensure SWIFT message is sent”) – “Transaction Analyst” as Consulted is not present in ground truth and is not justified.

3. **Task Wording Issues:**
   - Some task phrasings are inconsistent: e.g., “Notify case-file completion” (6a) is not a standalone task in the ground truth, but a notification event.
   - There are some invented tasks/steps (“Notify case-file completion”), which diverge from the source/ground truth.

4. **Granularity and Structure:**
   - The LLM answer divides some steps (like 5/5a and 6/6a), not matching the ground truth's organization and sometimes inventing columns.
   - Task wording deviates slightly from mandated vocabulary (“Receive transfer instruction and log in system” vs “Receive Payment Instruction”).

**Summary:**
Omitting a whole key role, frequently co-assigning R/A, and failing to match secondary responsibility role assignments—the answer fails to deliver a faithful, process-accurate, and vocabulary-compliant RACI as required. The only reason it does not score even lower is strict adherence to mandated vocabulary and format, and because the process sequencing is basically correct. Multiple serious errors justify a **3.5**.
