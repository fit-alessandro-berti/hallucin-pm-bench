3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt by using the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and covering all source steps in a Markdown RACI table. However, it deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, task formulation, and RACI assignments, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Structure and Format (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: 
  - The LLM uses a row-per-task format with separate columns for R/A/C/I and numbering/sub-numbering (e.g., 5a, 6a), while the ground truth uses a transposed format (tasks as rows, roles as columns) without numbering or sub-tasks. This alters clarity and organization, ignoring the ground truth's cleaner, consolidated layout. No legend is included, unlike the ground truth.

- **Task Naming and Coverage (moderate deduction: -1.5 points)**:
  - Tasks are more verbose and not aligned (e.g., LLM: "Receive transfer instruction and log in system" vs. ground truth: "Receive Payment Instruction"; LLM splits step 5 into "Release payment once approved" and 5a "Ensure SWIFT message is sent", while ground truth combines into "Release Payment"). LLM adds an unmandated sub-task 6a "Notify case-file completion", altering the source's integrated notification in step 6. Ground truth uses precise, mandated wording (e.g., bolded "**KYC Review**", "Archive Record") without extras.

- **Roles Used (moderate deduction: -1.0 points)**:
  - LLM sticks to source-derived roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), but omits the ground truth's "Operations Manager" (used as Accountable for all tasks). This creates a mismatch, as the prompt mandates specific terms but the ground truth expands roles for full RACI delegation.

- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Assignments differ substantially, with the LLM oversimplifying (e.g., doer role as both R and A for most tasks, sparse C/I) versus the ground truth's distributed responsibilities (e.g., Operations Manager as A everywhere; broader C/I across roles like TA consulting on KYC/Approve). Examples:
    - Receive: LLM (TA: R/A only) vs. GT (TA: R; Ops: A; IT: C; RL: I).
    - KYC Review: LLM (RL: R/A only) vs. GT (RL: R; Ops: A; TA: C; IT: I).
    - This ignores the ground truth's emphasis on consultation, accountability layers, and information flow, core to effective RACI.

Small errors (e.g., no bolding on "KYC Review", inconsistent capitalization in tasks) compound the issues, but the foundational mismatches in RACI logic and fidelity to the source mapping (as noted in ground truth) prevent a higher score. The LLM covers the basics but fails to match the ground truth's precision and best-practice distribution.
