10.0

**Evaluation Reasoning (strict line-by-line):**
- **Q1/A1**: Exact match ("3"). No differences.
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order). Escapes in ground truth (\_) are non-semantic (markdown/LaTeX artifact); factual content identical. No extras/missing.
- **Q3/A3**: Exact distinct activities (Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock), one per line, alphabetically ordered (A→C). Dashes (<br>/\-) and escapes in ground truth are extraneous formatting not required by prompt ("one per line, alphabetically ordered"). LLM precisely follows prompt instruction without hallucination, extras, or omissions.

No factual errors, hallucinations, or deviations; formatting variances do not penalize as they are non-prescribed and content matches perfectly. Full score under strict criteria.
