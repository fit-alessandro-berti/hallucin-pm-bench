**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the deterministic ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and rounding. For question 3, the response is ≤100 words (78 words), explicitly notes the single occurrence ("only one of twelve cases"), highlights instability/bias from low support ("extremely low... over-estimate... biased risk scores"), and cautions against over-generalisation ("mistakenly treated as representative... obscuring the true dynamics"). It directly addresses misleading performance/predictive analyses without invention, fully aligning with the criteria. No errors or deviations.
