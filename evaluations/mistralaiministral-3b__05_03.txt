The LLM answer fails entirely to address the SLA by omitting any timer mechanism (essential for the 48-hour enforcement), incorrectly modifies unrelated sequence flows with irrelevant conditions that do not relate to time or escalation, alters the core process logic (e.g., rerouting Flow_06 to AMReview without justification or timeout), ignores the unused escalation path's proper integration, and provides a justification that falsely claims time enforcement without implementing it, resulting in zero alignment with the ground truth's precise, compliant solution.
