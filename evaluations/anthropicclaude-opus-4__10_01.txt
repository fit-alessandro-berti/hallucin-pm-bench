4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (strong match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" as mandated, with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere. All activity names align with the required synonyms where applicable, and legacy terms are avoided.
  
- **Structure and Format (partial match, +1.0 point)**: The matrix format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns, no extra tasks/roles/columns introduced. However, minor deviations include an added header ("# RACI Matrix for Order-to-Cash Process"), a legend (unwarranted per ground truth's simplicity), and inconsistent bolding/styling (e.g., LLM bold-bolds the column header "Activity"; ground truth bolds specific activities like "**KYC Review**"). This adds slight extraneous content without enhancing accuracy.

- **RACI Allocations (major mismatches, -3.0 points from potential)**: This is the core failure, with 18 out of 24 cells differing from the ground truth (75% error rate). While the LLM correctly identifies the single *Responsible* (R) per activity based on the narrative (e.g., AM for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Notify Customer; CO for KYC Review; FC for Payment Clearance; IT for Record Update), it errs significantly elsewhere:
  - **Accountable (A) assignments**: LLM bundles A with R for all primary performers (e.g., CO as R,A for KYC Review; FC as R,A for Payment Clearance; IT as R,A for Record Update), but ground truth separates A for AM in non-AM-led activities (e.g., AM as A for KYC Review and Payment Clearance without R). This adds unwarranted A's (e.g., extra A for CO/FC/IT).
  - **Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments**: Widespread under-specification or swaps (e.g., Receive Application: CO as I vs. C; FC/IT as - vs. I; KYC Review: AM as I vs. A, FC as - vs. C, IT as C vs. I; Payment Clearance: AM as I vs. A, CO as - vs. C, IT as C vs. I; Record Update: AM as I vs. C, CO/FC as - vs. I/C; Notify Customer: CO/IT as - vs. I). These fail to "reflect the narrative" per the rubric, assuming broader involvement (e.g., more I/C across roles in ground truth).
  - No activity has more than one R (adheres to rubric), and AM is accountable where "appropriate" in some cases, but inconsistencies (e.g., missing AM A in KYC/Payment) and over-additions reduce fidelity.
  
- **Overall Correctness and Strictness Penalty**: Per rubric, RACI must precisely reflect the narrative/ground truth with exactly one R per activity and appropriate A'sâ€”LLM achieves ~50% on R's but fails on ~75% of other assignments, introducing errors that alter involvement (e.g., roles marked uninvolved with - instead of I/C). Small errors (e.g., single-cell swaps like IT in Order Vetting) compound with larger ones (e.g., missing AM A in two rows), warranting significant deduction. No self-awareness issues, but the response isn't a near-exact replica.

Total score reflects correct terminology/structure as a baseline, heavily penalized for RACI inaccuracies.
