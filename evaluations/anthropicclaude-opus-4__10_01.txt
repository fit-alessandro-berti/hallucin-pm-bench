6.0

**Rationale for Score:**

- **Terminology:**  
  The LLM answer strictly uses only the permitted terms (“KYC Review,” “Order Vetting,” “Payment Clearance”), complying fully with the vocabulary policy. No forbidden terms appear even in notes.

- **Structure:**  
  The matrix rows and columns are correct, and no unwarranted activities/roles are introduced. Formatting and legend are appropriate.

- **RACI Allocations:**
  - **Significant issues:**
    - **Incorrect RACI for several roles/activities:**  
      The LLM answer often misassigns roles as "Informed" (I), "Consulted" (C), "Responsible" (R), and "Accountable" (A) compared to the ground truth.
        - For example:
          - **Receive Application:** LLM says "R, A" for Account Manager (correct), but Compliance Officer gets "I" (should be C), Finance Clerk and IT Support are blank ("-"), which is incorrect (should be I, I)
          - **KYC Review:** LLM assigns "I" to Account Manager (should be A), "R, A" to Compliance Officer (should be just R), IT Support as "C" (should be I)
          - **Order Vetting:** LLM puts "C" for Compliance Officer (correct), "I" for Finance Clerk (correct), but omits IT Support (should be I)
          - **Payment Clearance:** LLM omits Account Manager’s "A" (only gives "I"), omits Compliance Officer’s "C"
          - **Record Update:** LLM has "I" for Account Manager (should be C), "R, A" for IT Support (OK), but omits other roles who should be C/I

      - Overall, the LLM’s RACI assignments frequently *omit* expected inform/consult roles, often give only the main roles for each activity, and sometimes make the AM "I" where it should be "A" or "C".
      - The ground truth distributes "I" and "C" consistently, whereas the LLM underreports those assignments for "peripheral" roles.

- **Loss of Points:**  
  - Not using forbidden terminology: no penalty.
  - Multiple minor and moderate RACI allocation mismatches—especially underuse of "I" and "C", and some misaligned "A" assignments—cause a significant loss, per instruction.
  - Formatting/structure are compliant.

**Summary:**  
The LLM handled terminology and structure entirely correctly, but made several moderate errors in RACI assignments (many missed "I/C", a few misapplied "A/R"), impacting the reliability of the matrix. Thus, a score of 6.0 reflects these substantial, but not catastrophic, deviations.
