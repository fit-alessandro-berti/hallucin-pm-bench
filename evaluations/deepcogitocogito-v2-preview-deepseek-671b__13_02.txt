The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b are exact matches in content and calculations (minor formatting differences, like spacing after %, do not warrant deduction). For Question 3, the response meets all criteria: (i) explicitly notes single occurrence in the concise summary; (ii) addresses instability/variance through overfitting, skewing, and misrepresentation of metrics; (iii) cautions against over-generalization via sampling bias and scaling risks. The explanation stays under 100 words in the provided summary, though the initial elaboration adds reasoning (not penalized as it derives solely from data). Minor deduction for not mirroring the ground truth sample's exact focus on statistical specifics (e.g., cycle time, confidence intervals) despite covering the core ideas.
