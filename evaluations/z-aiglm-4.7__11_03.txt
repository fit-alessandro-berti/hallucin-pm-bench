8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times, with exact matching quantifications of excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and wait times grounded in the table data. No inventions or extraneous metrics. Structure is a memo to COO with bullets exclusively for recommendations, as required.

Deductions for:
- Incomplete header (lacks From, Subject; plain vs. GT's formatted version): -0.5
- Introductory phrasing and data presentation in prose rather than GT's bolded, structured list format: -0.5
- Shorter length (~110 vs. ~150-180 words): -0.3
- Recommendations concrete and data-driven (tied to specific wait times) but generic/vague ("investigate," "prioritize resources") vs. GT's highly specific (e.g., "add one risk analyst"): -0.5
- Lacks GT's closing projection and minor styling (e.g., "s" spacing, bullet type): -0.2

Core requirements fully met with high fidelity to data and instructions, despite stylistic divergences.
