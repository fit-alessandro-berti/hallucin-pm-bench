The LLM answer identifies the correct and only two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines and Create_Documentation — Quality_Check), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format of one pair per line with "Task_X  —  Task_Y". No extraneous pairs or references to Process A.

However, under utmost strictness, there are small but noticeable formatting differences from the ground truth:
- Second pair lacks the extra padding spaces before the em dash (—) for column alignment ("Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines" vs. LLM's "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines").
- Potential minor trailing whitespace after the first pair ("Quality_Check  ").
- No enclosing code block or initial blank line as presented in ground truth (though not explicitly required by prompt).

These whitespace discrepancies constitute small errors, warranting a significant deduction (~1.0 point) despite perfect content accuracy.
