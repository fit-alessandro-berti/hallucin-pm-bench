The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all three parallel blocks from Process B with exact task names, order, and comma separation matching the ground truth. No extraneous or incorrect tasks are included, fully adhering to the "only Process B" and "exclude sequential tasks" constraints. Minor deductions for the unnecessary introductory sentence (violating the strict "Return your answer as numbered lines" format) and potential minor whitespace/formatting differences (e.g., trailing spaces in ground truth), treated strictly as format deviations despite semantic perfection.
