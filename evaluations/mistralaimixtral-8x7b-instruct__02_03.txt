9.2

- **A1 match**: Correct count and cases listed (minor deduction for different order and extra wording vs. ground truth's exact phrasing/order).
- **A2 match**: Correct activity, but wordier full sentence vs. ground truth's single term (conciseness violation).
- **A3 match**: Correct activity, but wordier vs. ground truth.
- **Format**: Numbered list close to "bullet-point" but not identical (* bullets with **A#** labels); prompt specifies "concise, bullet-point answers only" – minor format deviation.
- Overall: Semantically perfect, but strict conciseness/format differences prevent 10.
