8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the trace as "Non-compliant" and accurately cites the two relevant violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event references, matching the ground truth on those points. Phrasing is nearly identical (e.g., Expedite_Flag at #4, Ship_Goods at #8, Risk_Assessment at #9; Goods_Received at #6, Three_way_match at #10 beyond next two activities). No factual errors.

However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions for incompleteness:
- Fails to systematically evaluate **all 5 rules** as in ground truth (omits Rules 1, 4, 5, which are satisfied).
- Lacks comprehensive structure (GT numbers justifications by rule ID 1-5 with "Satisfied/Violated" status, case attribute citations like PO_Amount, and explicit overall conclusion tying violations to non-compliance).
- Justification is partial/concise rather than full audit, representing a key difference in thoroughness for a "senior process-audit bot" (covers ~40% of GT's justification content).
- Minor phrasing diffs (e.g., no "order is reversed" or "distance=3"; no bolding or summary).

Perfect match would require identical full coverage; this is strong but incomplete, warranting deduction from 10.0.
