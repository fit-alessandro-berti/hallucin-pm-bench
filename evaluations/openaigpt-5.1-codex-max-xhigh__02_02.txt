8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown (strict line-by-line assessment):
- **Q1/A1**: Factual match on "3", but extra redundant phrasing ("distinct cases") and fabricated addition of case list "(C001, C002, C003)" not in ground truth. Significant deduction for extras (-1.5).
- **Q2/A2**: Exact sequence match (ignoring irrelevant \_ escaping in ground truth, as LLM matches prompt's plain text). Minor prefix extra ("C002 activity sequence: "). Small deduction (-0.5).
- **Q3/A3**: List content, order, and "one per line" format exact match (LLM's newlines equivalent to <br>). Minor intro extra ("Activities immediately preceding..."). Small deduction (-0.5).

**Total**: Perfect facts (no missing/fabricated elements), but consistent extras treated as minor hallucinations per instructions. 10.0 - 2.0 = 8.5.
