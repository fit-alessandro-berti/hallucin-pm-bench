5.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides accurate details for Cases 1001 and 1003, including the reversed order. However, it omits Case 1002 entirely, where "Update_Inventory" is absent despite "Authorize_Refund" occurring, which directly disproves the "always" claim (as highlighted in the ground truth). This is a significant omission in a comprehensive justification, as all cases must be considered to fully evaluate universality. The LLM's qualification ("where both activities are present") narrows the scope incorrectly, avoiding the absence issue. Under strict evaluation, these errors warrant a substantial deduction from a full score.
