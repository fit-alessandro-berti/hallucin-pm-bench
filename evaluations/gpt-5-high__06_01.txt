The LLM answer correctly identifies both valid pairs:

- Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
- Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

However, it loses significant points for formatting:

- It does **not** properly align the pairs (second pair should match spaces in the ground truth: "Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines").
- The instructions say “return the pairs in alphabetical order, both *within* each pair and in your overall list”: within-pair order is correct, and the overall order matches the ground truth, so that part is fine.
- The formatting differs slightly (no code block, spaces).
- There are no extra or missing pairs; content is otherwise correct.

Overall, the mistakes are minor formatting issues (mainly spacing/alignment), not the substance or logic, but given the instruction for “utmost strictness,” these small formatting deviations incur a notable penalty.
