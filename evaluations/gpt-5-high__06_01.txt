The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B, lists them in proper alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format with one pair per line. The tasks are accurately named and spaced as per the prompt's example ("Task_X  â€”  Task_Y" with double spaces around the em dash). However, it lacks the monospaced alignment of the dashes seen in the ground truth (extra leading spaces on the second line to vertically align the em dashes), which is a minor formatting discrepancy warranting a small deduction under strict evaluation criteria. No other errors or omissions.
