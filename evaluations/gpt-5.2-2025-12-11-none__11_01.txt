**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (perfect, full marks)**: Top 3 activities ranked correctly by avg waiting time (Request_Documents 36.5 > Send_Closure_Letter 12.2 > Assess_Liability 7.8). Quotes match table verbatim (e.g., 36.5, 120.0; 12.2, 44.0; 7.8, 16.4), including decimals ground truth omits (120.0 vs. 120).
- **No unwarranted content (minor deduction)**: No service-time, other activities, or throughput *times/rates*. Executions (275/255/310) mentioned as scale justification—arguably borderline "throughput volume" but tied data-driven to actions, not discussed as metric. No other extras violate.
- **Action relevance (strong)**: Each concrete, logically tied to waiting (e.g., automation for docs/letters, queuing for assess), promises ≥20% cut explicitly. Data-driven via table data/executions (no unsupported invention like ground truth's "pilot tests"/"30%"). Creative but valid alternatives.
- **Format/memo style (minor diffs)**: Crisp (<150 words), executive tone with intro/context (improves on ground truth's abrupt start). Structure mirrors ground (#1–#3, metrics then action), but bolder formatting, fuller phrasing ("95th pct" vs. "p95"), added "h". Strictness deducts slightly for non-identical style/content divergence.
- **Overall**: Extremely close adherence to prompt/scoring notes; superior to ground truth in precision (decimals), no invention. Differences stylistic/creative (actions, intro, executions)—not errors—warrant minor loss under utmost strictness.
