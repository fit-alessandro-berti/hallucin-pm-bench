**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: it claims "Yes" despite clear counterexamples (e.g., line 6 Validate_Payment before line 7 Receive_Order in C003; C005 line 11 Validate_Payment with no prior Receive_Order). It misidentifies Validate_Payment occurrences (falsely lists line 7, which is Receive_Order) and preceding events (line 4 is Check_Inventory, not Receive_Order; line 10 is Pack_Items). These multiple factual errors in answer and justification yield the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria.
