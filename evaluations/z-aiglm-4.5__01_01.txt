4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Shortfall, ~40% of Score)**: The LLM answer identifies only 1 decision point (the amount threshold/branch), missing 2 critical ones from the ground truth: (1) the eligibility check in **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** (with explicit branching to rejection) and (2) the final approval in **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** / **Senior_Auditor_Review** (with approval/rejection outcomes). The process description implies these validations involve decisions (e.g., "validate eligibility" and "pre-approve"), as interpreted in the ground truth. The LLM's claim of "only explicit decision point" is overly narrow and ignores implicit branching, leading to a severe incompleteness. Structure (prose vs. table) and failure to fully summarize "every" point further deduct points under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents (Full Match, ~60% of Score)**: The LLM lists all 7 documents identically to the ground truth, including conditional notes for **AuditTrail** and adherence to the "no other documents" constraint. No errors here, but this alone cannot compensate for the decision points' deficiencies.

Overall, the answer is partially correct but critically incomplete on the primary task component, warranting a low score despite strictness. Small additions (e.g., note on legacy activity) are irrelevant and do not mitigate issues.
