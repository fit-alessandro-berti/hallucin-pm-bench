**Score: 8.0**

The LLM answer is correct in its conclusion ("No") and generally accurate in its justification:

- It lists the activity sequences for all four cases, correctly reflecting the ordering of activities.
- It highlights CaseID C002 as a counterexample, explicitly stating that "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment", which directly contradicts the FACT.
- The answer structure is clear and cites the relevant case sequences.

However, compared to the ground-truth answer, it is missing some aspects:

1. **Depth of Explicit Justification**:  
   - The ground truth gives an explicit, systematic case-by-case breakdown and clearly labels which cases conform and which do not, using tick/cross icons for clarity.
   - The LLM answer, while listing all sequences, only explicitly calls out C002 as a violation, and only implicitly (by showing) that C004 is also a violation. Better rigor would have called out both C002 and C004 as explicit counterexamples.

2. **Coverage of Evidence**:  
   - The LLM answer does not make it explicitly clear which cases do conform to the rule, unlike the ground-truth table which says C001 and C003 match and C002/C004 don't.

3. **Clarity and Rigor**:  
   - The ground-truth answer uses a table for easier verification; the LLM's prose, though correct, requires more effort to verify and is slightly less rigorous.

Given these gaps—especially the failure to explicitly mention both C002 and C004 as counterexamples and to state which cases conform—2 points are deducted for strictness, resulting in an 8.0.
