The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides accurate sequences for all four cases, fulfilling the task's requirements for justification via CaseIDs and activity sequences. It effectively uses C002 as a clear counterexample to disprove "always," and the listed sequences implicitly reveal the violation in C004 (Check_Fraud intervenes). However, under utmost strictness, it loses 1.0 point for not explicitly analyzing immediacy across *all* cases (e.g., no per-case yes/no markers or notes on C001/C003 compliance, unlike the ground truth's comprehensive table), making the justification slightly less thorough despite being factually sound and sufficient.
