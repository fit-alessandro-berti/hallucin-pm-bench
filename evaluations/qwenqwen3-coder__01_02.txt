### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (major issues, ~50% match)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the first two decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with accurate terminology, conditions, and flows, closely aligning with the ground truth. However, it completely omits the third decision point—the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA) as a voting decision (Approve or Reject)—which is explicitly listed in the ground truth as a core decision point. It also lacks the ground truth's contextual details on sequencing (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). These omissions and reduced detail represent significant inaccuracies, warranting a substantial point deduction under strict criteria.
  
- **Required Documents (minor issues, ~85% match)**: The list is complete and uses exact names/abbreviations from the prompt (e.g., ML-APP-01, CIS, NFF). However, there are small but notable deviations from the ground truth: phrasing differences (e.g., "not older than 3 months" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; adding "(CIS) template" where ground truth has just "(CIS)"); unnumbered bullets vs. ground truth's numbered list; and omission of the ground truth's closing note ("*(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)*"). Even these minor wording and formatting inconsistencies result in point loss per the strict evaluation guidelines.

Overall, the response is helpful and on-topic but undermined by the critical missing decision point and cumulative small errors, preventing a higher score.
