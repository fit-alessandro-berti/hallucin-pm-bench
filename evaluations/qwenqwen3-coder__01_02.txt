7.3

The LLM answer is mostly accurate in both listing the required documents and summarizing the decision points using the specified terminology. However, there are several small but significant shortcomings compared to the provided ground truth:

**Decision points:**
- **Omission:** The LLM answer omits the explicit mention of the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** step as a decision point. The ground truth lists this as its own third and final decision point, stating “the board votes Approve or Reject,” which is missing in the LLM answer.
- **Sequencing/Ambiguity:** The LLM answer gives the impression that the process may end at Amount Threshold Decision if under €15,000, but does not clearly mention what happens if over €15,000 besides “proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).” It doesn’t specify the actual board decision, which is itself a critical decision point.

**Required documents:**
- **Correctness:** The LLM answer clearly lists all the required documents, including their correct names and details, matching the ground truth almost exactly.
- **Slight Issue:** The LLM answer writes “Proof of Address (not older than 3 months)” (vs “≤ 3 months”). This is a minor detail but still slightly different from the strict wording in the ground truth.
- **Formatting:** Some minor differences in the formatting (e.g., missing the list numbering), but this isn’t substantial for content accuracy.

**Terminology:**
- The activity names and the terms used in the LLM summary are mostly as specified, with minimal deviation.

**Scoring Rationale:**
- Omitting the explicit MBA decision point is a critical miss.
- Not including the final affirmative/negative board decision (“Approve or Reject”) reduces clarity and completeness.
- Small detail loss in document description.

Given the requirement for “utmost strictness” and considering that even small errors should result in a notable loss of points, these shortcomings cumulatively warrant a significant reduction from a perfect score.

**Overall: 7.3**
