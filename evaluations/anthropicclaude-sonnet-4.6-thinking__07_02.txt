**7.0**

### Evaluation Reasoning (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer correctly identifies **all** required changes matching the ground truth:
- **Added tasks**: Exact match (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject).
- **Removed tasks**: Exact match (Task_RejectLoan).
- **Gateway-type changes**: Exact match (Gateway_Decision: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway).

No missed changes, no incorrect additions/removals. Ignores cosmetic renamings (e.g., Task_ApproveLoan name, gateway name) correctly.

**Penalties for differences (utmost strictness, significant deductions for any deviation):**
- **Extra content & analysis** (-1.5): Unrequested explanations (e.g., insertion locations, "replaced by more granular tasks", XOR/OR semantics details, "fundamentally changing routing"). Violates "**strictly** under the three headings" – ground truth is purely listing, no interpretation.
- **Structural/format differences** (-1.0): Tables vs. numbered lists; ID-first vs. name-first; "###" headings + separators + title vs. "**bold**" headings; code blocks/backticks unnecessary.
- **Misplaced/irrelevant details** (-0.5): Gateway table includes unrequested "Name Change (non-cosmetic implication)" column – name change is cosmetic (to ignore), not a "gateway-type change"; wrongly labels as "non-cosmetic".
 
Core accuracy is excellent (9.5/10 equivalent), but extras deviate substantially from ground truth's concise format, warranting deductions. Total: 10.0 - 3.0 = 7.0.
