The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines and Quality_Check — Create_Documentation), with no additions or omissions, aligning with the ground truth content. However, it fails the strict alphabetical ordering requirements: (1) within the second pair, "Quality_Check" (Q) precedes "Create_Documentation" (C), reversing the correct order; (2) the overall list order is incorrect, starting with "Procure_Materials" (P) instead of the "Create_Documentation" (C) pair first; (3) minor formatting inconsistencies, such as inconsistent spacing around the em dash and lack of alignment in the second pair. These violations of explicit instructions warrant a significant deduction under strict evaluation criteria, resulting in partial credit for content accuracy but substantial loss for non-compliance.
