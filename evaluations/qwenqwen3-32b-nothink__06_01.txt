The LLM answer correctly identifies the two parallel-eligible pairs, and the task names are both exactly as used in the process description. However, it does not fully adhere to the requested output format:
- The answer omits the required alphabetical ordering of pairs both **within each pair** (tasks in each pair should be alphabetized) and **overall** (the two pairs should be alphabetized by their first task).
- The pair "Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines" is listed before "Quality_Check  —  Create_Documentation", but since "Create_Documentation" comes before "Procure_Materials" alphabetically, this order is incorrect.
- Within the pair "Quality_Check  —  Create_Documentation", the tasks should be swapped as "Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check" to satisfy within-pair alphabetical order.

For these (not minor) format issues—even though the substantive content is correct—I deduct 2 full points for lack of strict adherence to explicit instructions.
