**8.5**

Statuses for all rules and overall result match ground truth perfectly (100% accuracy). Justifications are correct in substance, ≤20 words each, and identify key violations accurately. Minor deductions for:
- Missing bold formatting on statuses (e.g., **Compliant** vs. plain "Compliant").
- R1 omits explicit "amount > €10 000" trigger.
- R2 lacks dates, "Expedited", and "> 2 days" specificity (focuses on "before approval" vs. time delta).
- R5 mentions only "shipping" (omits Pay_Invoice example).
- List format with "R# –" prefixes vs. ground truth table (minor).
- R1/R6 slightly verbose vs. ground truth conciseness.

Core logic sound; no factual errors. Strict grading reflects phrasing/precision gaps.
