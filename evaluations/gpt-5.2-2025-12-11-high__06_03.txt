9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, in the correct order, with precise task names matching the source description. It adheres strictly to the prompt by focusing solely on Process B, numbering the sets sequentially, and providing no extraneous information. Semantic content is identical to the ground truth.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for:
- Different header phrasing ("Parallel Split #1" vs. "Set 1 – first parallel block"), though LLM's matches the process description more literally.
- Set notation ({comma-separated} vs. `‖`), both valid but not identical.
- Absence of the ground truth's closing sentence ("No other tasks..."), which adds explicit completeness (not required by prompt but present in benchmark).
- Formatting variances (bold vs. backticks).

No content errors; strict evaluation still yields high score due to perfect functional match.
