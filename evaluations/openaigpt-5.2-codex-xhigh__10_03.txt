**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth):
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, ~+1.0)**: All four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") used exactly. No leaks of disallowed synonyms. However, additional activity names deviate (e.g., "Compliance Officer approval" vs. "**Compliance Officer Approval**"; "Release the funds" vs. "**Release Funds**"; extras like "Schedule the payment" and "Notify the originating analyst" not matching GT).
- **Structure and format errors (major deduction, ~-3.0)**: 8 rows vs. GT's 6 (added unauthorized rows for "Schedule the payment" and "Notify the originating analyst", violating "do not rename, merge, or add activities"). No bolding on activities or R/A as in GT (**R, A** vs. R/A). Dashes inconsistent (— vs. –). Column headers match but lack GT's spacing/alignment.
- **RACI assignments (catastrophic mismatch, ~-5.0)**: Nearly every cell differs:
  | Activity | Matching Cells | Key Errors |
  |----------|----------------|------------|
  | Intake Vetting | FO only | Comp: I vs. C; Treas: — vs. I |
  | KYC Review | Comp only | CO: — vs. C; Treas: — vs. I |
  | AML Screening | Comp only | CO: — vs. C; Treas: — vs. I |
  | Risk Scoring | None | All wrong (FO — vs. C; Comp R/A vs. R; CO — vs. A; Treas — vs. I) |
  | Compliance Officer approval | Comp & CO only | FO: — vs. I; Treas: I vs. – |
  | Release the funds | Treas only | FO: — vs. I; Comp: — vs. C; CO: — vs. C |
  | Extras (Schedule, Notify) | N/A | Unauthorized additions |
- **Overall**: ~25% cell accuracy on shared rows, but extras, renames, and pervasive RACI errors make it non-compliant. Strict policy demands near-exact GT match; small errors (e.g., no bold, dash variant) compound to fail.
