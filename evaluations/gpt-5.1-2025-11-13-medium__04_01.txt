8.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness of core conclusion and violations (high marks):** Both identify "Non-compliant" status accurately, with identical detection of violations in Rules 2 and 3 (correct citations to events, precise reasoning on timing/order/distance). Satisfied rules (1, 4, 5) are also correctly assessed with no factual errors.
- **Structural and formatting differences (moderate deduction):** The LLM answer uses a numbered list that prioritizes violations (Rules 2 and 3 as points 1-2) before satisfied rules (1, 4, 5 as points 3-5), disrupting sequential rule order (ground truth follows Rules 1-5 strictly). No "Justification" header, and lacks the ground truth's concluding summary sentence explaining overall non-compliance due to specific rules. These are small but notable deviations from the implied structured format.
- **Wording and minor phrasing (minor deduction):** Slight rephrasing (e.g., LLM's Rule 4 focuses on CFO's follower vs. ground truth's focus on Intern's predecessor; no bolding or exact phrasing matches) introduces subtle inconsistencies, warranting a strict penalty per instructions.
- **Overall strictness:** Content is 95% aligned, but structural/formatting mismatches and absence of summary reduce from a perfect score; no major errors, but small ones cost ~1.5 points total.
