6.0

- The LLM answer consistently uses the mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"), which is good.
- However, it has significant inaccuracies in RACI assignments:
    - It omits the distinction between "Responsible" and "Accountable" (R/A or A). For example, in "Receive Application," the AM is both Responsible and Accountable in the ground truth, but only marked as "Responsible" in the LLM answer.
    - There is inconsistent or missing use of "Consulted" (C) and "Informed" (I); several roles listed as C or I in ground truth are marked as "Not Involved" in the LLM answer.
    - For "KYC Review," the LLM wrongly assigns "Consulted" to AM (should be "A") and omits "C" for FC; similar issues exist across the other activities.
    - The distinction between "Responsible" and "Accountable" is generally lost throughout.
- Formatting is clear, roles are all present, activities are all present with the correct terms, and forbidden phrases are not mentioned.
- No unwarranted content.

Given the strictness requirement and that core RACI detail is missing or misapplied for almost every row, the answer deserves a significant penalty. It demonstrates partial understanding but repeatedly fails on required RACI rigor. Thus, 6.0 reflects good terminology adherence, but large content fidelity issues.
