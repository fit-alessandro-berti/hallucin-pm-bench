2.5

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Vocabulary Adherence (Positive, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere.
- **Structure and Content Completeness (-1.5 points)**: Activities match the six required steps without additions or omissions. No extra tasks, roles, or columns. However, column headers differ (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)" vs. ground truth's "Account Manager" without abbreviations), and the table lacks bolding on mandated terms (**KYC Review**, etc.) and key RACI entries (e.g., **R / A**).
- **RACI Correctness (Major Deduction, -4.0 points)**: This is the core failure. Allocations do not reflect the process narrative or ground truth:
  - Misses multiple Accountable (A) roles for Account Manager (e.g., Receive Application should be **R / A**, not just "Responsible"; similar for Order Vetting and Notify Customer).
  - Incorrectly uses "Not Involved" instead of standard RACI codes (e.g., no "I" for Informed in places like IT for multiple rows; omits "C" for Consulted entirely in rows like KYC Review, where FC should be C, and Payment Clearance, where AM and CO should be A/C).
  - Specific mismatches per row:
    - Receive Application: Misses CO as C; FC/IT as I.
    - KYC Review: AM as "Consulted" (should be A); misses FC as C; IT as I.
    - Order Vetting: CO as "Consulted" (correct for C), but AM as "Responsible" (should be **R / A**); misses I for others.
    - Payment Clearance: Misses AM as A, CO as C; IT as I.
    - Record Update: Misses AM/FC as C; CO as I.
    - Notify Customer: AM as "Responsible" (should be **R / A**); misses I for others.
  - While each row has one Responsible (aligning with narrative), it ignores consultations/informations and all accountability, making the matrix incomplete and non-standard (uses words like "Not Involved" instead of R/A/C/I).
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, even minor formatting differences (e.g., no **R / A** notation, inconsistent role wording) compound with substantive errors, warranting severe point loss. The answer is ~70% divergent from ground truth cells, failing to "reflect the narrative" fully. Self-awareness N/A, no unwarranted content.
