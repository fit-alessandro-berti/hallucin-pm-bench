4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Rubric Application)
- **Terminology Correctness (max +3.0 points)**: Full credit. The LLM uses exactly "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere, adhering strictly to the vocabulary policy.
- **RACI Allocations Accuracy (max +5.0 points)**: Severe deductions (-4.5 total). Assignments must precisely match the ground truth, reflecting the process narrative with exactly one Responsible (R) per activity, appropriate Accountable (A) roles (often AM), and full specification of Consulted (C)/Informed (I). 
  - Correct elements: Primary R and A for some activities align loosely (e.g., AM R/A for Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer; CO R for KYC Review; FC R for Payment Clearance; IT R for Record Update).
  - Major errors (each causing -0.5 to -1.0 deduction):
    - Omits or blanks C/I roles entirely in most cells (e.g., no CO:C in Receive Application/Order Vetting/Payment Clearance; no FC:C in KYC Review; no IT:I across nearly all activities; no CO:I/FC:I/IT:I in Notify Customer; no CO:I in Record Update). Blanks ("-") imply absence, violating full RACI specification.
    - Wrong roles: AM C instead of A in KYC Review/Payment Clearance (-0.5 each); CO R,A instead of R (with A on AM) in KYC Review (-0.5); FC R,A instead of R (with A on AM) in Payment Clearance (-0.5); IT R,A instead of R in Record Update (-0.5); IT C instead of I in Notify Customer (-0.5).
    - No activity has zero R (good), but multiple have misplaced/incorrect A, failing "AM accountable where appropriate" from notes.
  - Only ~30% of the 24 cells (6 activities × 4 roles) are fully accurate; the rest are wrong or omitted.
- **Format and Structure (max +1.5 points)**: Partial credit (+0.5). Attempts rows (activities) and columns (roles: AM, CO, FC, IT) as specified, with a list-based matrix approximation. However, deduct -1.0 for not using a proper table (ground truth is markdown table); blanks ("-") instead of explicit I/C; inconsistent formatting (e.g., no bolding or clear delimiters like ground truth).
- **Unwarranted Content (max +0.5 points)**: Minor deduction (-0.2). Introductory text ("Here’s the RACI matrix...") is extra and unneeded (ground truth has none). No added tasks/roles/columns, so not total loss.
- **Overall Strictness Adjustment**: Even small omissions (e.g., single blank vs. I) warrant significant loss per instructions. The LLM captures the basics but fundamentally misinterprets RACI by ignoring consultative/informational roles and shifting A inappropriately, diverging sharply from ground truth narrative inference. Self-awareness N/A as noted. Total reflects ~40% fidelity.
