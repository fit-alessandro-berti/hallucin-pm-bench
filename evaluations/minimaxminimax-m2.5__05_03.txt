### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Functional correctness (major weight)**: Perfect match—both add an interrupting boundary timer event (cancelActivity="true") on `Activity_CreateAccount` with `PT48H` duration, connect it via sequenceFlow to the existing unused `Activity_AMReview`, and provide a one-sentence justification enforcing the SLA using only existing elements. No new activities added. (+10/10)
- **XML fidelity to ground truth (high weight, strict)**:
  - Missing `xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"` on `<bpmn:timeDuration>` (required for consistency with original XML style and BPMN FormalExpression handling; significant schema/style error). (-1.0)
  - No `name="48h breach"` attribute on boundaryEvent (omits descriptive labeling present in ground truth). (-0.4)
  - Lacks explanatory comments (e.g., `<!-- ❶ -->`, `<!-- ❷ -->`) and code block formatting (```xml). (-0.2)
  - Different arbitrary IDs (`Timer_48h`/ `Flow_09` vs. `Boundary_LateCreate`/ `Flow_LateEscalation`); acceptable but deviates. (-0.1)
- **Justification fidelity (high weight, strict)**:
  - Core idea identical, but wording less precise: omits "pre-existing", "**Create Account**" bold/exact task name, "timeout", and explicit "without introducing any new activities" (task requirement echoed in ground truth). No "*Justification (1 sentence):*" header. Uses "account‑creation task" (imprecise) and "48 hours" (minor typography). (-0.1)
- **Overall compliance**: Concise, only added/changed elements, no full model repeat. No extraneous content. Total deductions reflect small but cumulative differences under utmost strictness.
