2.5

The LLM answer demonstrates serious non-compliance with the process’s requirements. Details:

**Vocabulary accuracy:**  
- The matrix correctly uses only the authorized terms: “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, “Risk Scoring”.  
- Does NOT introduce any forbidden synonyms.  
- However, it omits the activities “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”, both explicitly contained in the ground truth, and thereby renames/merges items in violation of the prompt.

**Activity coverage:**  
- The LLM matrix collapses several activities from the narrative into single lines (“Payment Release” for “Release Funds”, omitting an explicit “Compliance Officer Approval” activity).
- “Intake Vetting” is present, but its responsibility/accountability is incomplete: Front-Office Analyst is marked only Responsible (R), missing Accountable (A); missing Consulted (C) and Informed (I) assignments.
- “Compliance Officer Approval” is completely missing from the matrix, as is “Release Funds” (replaced by the unsanctioned and too-generic “Payment Release”).

**Role coverage:**  
- The RACI allocation within activities deviates from the ground truth. For example:  
  - “KYC Review”, “AML Screening” lack ICT consulting/information roles (the LLM assigns only R, missing A and all other stakeholders).
  - “Risk Scoring” incorrectly makes Compliance Analyst only R and Compliance Officer A, but omits the C/I involvement.
  - “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”—both crucial escalation/authorization steps—are not even present.

**Other significant errors:**  
- The number and names of activities are incorrect; required activities are both omitted and merged (“Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”).
- The LLM answer fails to indicate specific roles are both Responsible and Accountable where the ground truth makes that explicit (using “R, A”); instead it gives just “R” (e.g., “Intake Vetting”).
- The LLM answer offers no dash (–) for out-of-scope roles, compromising readability and completeness per ground truth.

Given the multiple and serious structural, naming, and responsibility assignment issues, despite reasonable adherence to vocabulary, the answer deserves a very low score. Minor vocabulary compliance prevents a 1.0, but the omissions, mergers, and lack of RACI completeness demand a severe penalty.
