### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially aligns with the ground truth but exhibits significant deviations in structure, completeness, and accuracy, warranting a moderately low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Activities (major deduction: -3.0 points)**: The prompt requires covering **every activity** without renaming, merging, or adding. The LLM correctly identifies and uses the four authorized terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) exactly as specified, with no disallowed synonyms leaking in. However, it merges the escalation/approval process into Risk Scoring (with an improper parenthetical note) and adds an unauthorized "Payment Release" activity, while omitting the distinct "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" from the ground truth. This alters the process flow and violates the "no merge/add" rule, creating incomplete coverage of the narrative's escalation, release, and notification elements.

- **RACI Assignments (major deduction: -2.0 points)**: Basic responsibilities (R) are often correct (e.g., Front-Office Analyst R for Intake Vetting; Compliance Analyst R for KYC/AML/Risk Scoring; Treasury Ops R for release). However, it misses critical accountabilities (A, e.g., Front-Office A for Intake Vetting; Compliance Analyst A for KYC/AML), consultations (C, e.g., Compliance Officer C for KYC/AML; Front-Office C for Risk Scoring; Compliance Analyst C for Approval/Release), and informeds (I, e.g., Treasury Ops I across multiple; Front-Office I for Approval/Release). The conditional note in Risk Scoring introduces extraneous text not in the ground truth, and empty cells imply no involvement where ground truth uses explicit "–" or assigns roles (e.g., no C/I for Compliance Analyst in Intake Vetting).

- **Format and Presentation (minor deduction: -0.5 points)**: Markdown table is used, but bolding is inconsistent (single **R** vs. ground truth's **R,A** combined), and the parenthetical in Risk Scoring disrupts table purity. Dashes (–) are absent where needed for no involvement.

Overall, the answer captures the core authorized vocabulary and some R assignments (earning partial credit), but structural omissions and incomplete RACI mappings deviate substantially from the ground truth's detailed interpretation of the process narrative, reflecting ~50% fidelity at best. Small errors like missing C/I amplify the loss due to strictness.
