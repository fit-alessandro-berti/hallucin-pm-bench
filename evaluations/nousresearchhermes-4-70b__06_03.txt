2.0

The LLM answer is significantly incomplete and does not follow instructions:

- It only lists tasks from the first parallel block (`Quality_Check` and `Update_Inventory`), completely omitting the second set of concurrently executable tasks (`Generate_Replenishment_Report` and `Notify_Procurement`) which are required by the prompt.
- It fails to present the information as numbered sets corresponding to *each* parallel construct in order, as explicitly required.
- The output format does not reflect the grouping of concurrent tasks per parallel split, as the ground truth answer does (listing them as sets).
- By providing single tasks as individual points rather than as sets of tasks per parallel block, the model misrepresents the concurrency structure of the process.
- There is no mention that no other tasks in Process B run concurrently, as the ground truth specifies.

Thus, only a minimal score is warranted for correctly identifying the tasks in the first parallel block, but with incorrect format, grouping, and incompleteness, leading to a 2.0.
