The LLM answer correctly identifies the answer as "No" and provides a valid justification by citing the two counterexample cases (C002 and C004) with accurate sequences, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns with the task's requirements for citing relevant CaseIDs and sequences. However, under utmost strictness, it loses points for incompleteness: it omits analysis of C001 and C003 (where the sequence holds true), failing to provide the comprehensive case-by-case coverage seen in the ground truth, which explicitly verifies all instances and quantifies the violations (e.g., "two out of four"). This makes the justification less meticulous and exhaustive, warranting a significant deduction despite the core accuracy.
