### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Core identification (3 worst activities)**: Matches ground truth (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment). Perfect (full points here).
- **Joint criteria (SLA breaches + high waiting time)**: Both emphasize top waits (600s, 480s, 200s) with breaches; LLM explicitly ranks them. Minor phrasing diff, no deduction.
- **Quantification of SLA exceedance**: 
  - Legal: +300s correct.
  - Risk Review: **Major error** – LLM claims +200s (600 vs 300); actual +300s. Arithmetic failure on core metric (-2.0 points).
  - Credit: +60s correct.
  - Ground truth uses throughput explicitly; LLM does too but with error.
- **Waiting times**: All correct, but LLM adds erroneous % calculations (e.g., Risk "100%" vs actual 80%; sloppy phrasing like "(600s) spent waiting") (-0.8 points).
- **Recommendations (one concrete, data-driven per activity, bullets only)**:
  - Bullets used correctly, one per activity.
  - **Completely different content** from ground truth (e.g., LLM: automation/pre-screening/batch; GT: pre-checks/analyst+automation/heuristic). Both invent unsupported details (e.g., LLM's 30%/70%/80%/40%; GT's €25k/35%), violating "ground in data/no invent metrics," but LLM more quantified inventions (-1.5 points).
- **Structure/Format**:
  - LLM adds unrequired title/Date/Impacts (verbose, >150 words?; invents "systemic delays"/"stuck"); GT concise with Subject/total cases (-1.0).
  - From/To minor diffs; both memo-like.
  - Bullets "only for recs": Both precede with prose describing activities (partial violation, no deduction).
- **Overall fidelity**: Same activities/quants (mostly), but math error, inventions, verbosity diverge significantly from GT's concise style. Strict penalty for errors: starts at 10, deducts 3.8 total.
