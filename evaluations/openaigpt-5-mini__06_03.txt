### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer correctly identifies and numbers the two exact sets of concurrent tasks from Process B, matching the ground truth's core content without extraneous information about other processes. This shows strong semantic accuracy and adherence to the prompt's focus.

However, under strict evaluation:
- **Formatting differences (significant deduction: -1.0)**: Uses semicolons (";") to separate tasks instead of the ground truth's parallel symbol ("‖"), and lacks backticks for code-like task naming. These are small but consistent stylistic errors.
- **Lack of descriptive labels (-0.3)**: Omits the explanatory phrases like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**", which provide context in the ground truth.
- **Missing concluding sentence (-0.2)**: Does not include "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," which explicitly reinforces completeness in the ground truth.

Overall, the answer is highly effective and prompt-compliant but not identical due to these polish issues, warranting a high but imperfect score.
