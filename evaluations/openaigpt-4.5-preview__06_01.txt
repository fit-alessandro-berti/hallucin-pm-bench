The LLM's answer gives the correct task pairs and in the correct order, but it loses 1 point for not matching the exact formatting required in the ground truth: it omits the double spaces in "Procure_Materials     â€”  Schedule_Machines" (only a single space is used between the task names and the em dash), whereas the ground truth uses multiple spaces to align the em dashes. This is a minor, but not negligible, deviation in formatting. The content and ordering are otherwise strictly correct.
