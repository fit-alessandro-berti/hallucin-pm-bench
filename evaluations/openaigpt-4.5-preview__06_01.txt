The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content, identifying the correct and only two parallel pairs from Process B, with proper alphabetical ordering within pairs and overall. Output format adheres to the specified one-pair-per-line structure using the exact delimiter. Minor visual alignment differences in spacing (e.g., leading spaces in the ground truth for columnar display) are not required by the prompt and do not constitute an error.
