**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary compliance (partial credit, +1.5)**: Correctly uses all four mandated terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring"). No disallowed synonyms leak. However, added activities use unauthorized names ("Approval", "Payment Scheduling", "Fund Release") vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds" – violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities".
- **Activities coverage (+0.5)**: Covers the four core activities + extras to match "every activity", but adds/merges incorrectly (7 rows vs. 6; invents "Payment Scheduling" with no ground truth equivalent; renames others).
- **RACI assignments (major errors, -5.0+)**: ~70% of cells mismatch:
  | Activity (LLM vs. GT) | Mismatches |
  |-----------------------|------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Comp (I vs. C), Treas (- vs. I) |
  | KYC Review | Front (C vs. –), Off (I vs. C), Treas (- vs. I) |
  | AML Screening | Same 3 as KYC |
  | Risk Scoring | All 4 cells: Front (I vs. C), Comp (R/A vs. R), Off (I vs. A), Treas (- vs. I) |
  | Approval (~GT Approval) | Treas (I vs. –) |
  | Payment Scheduling | Entire extra row invalid |
  | Fund Release (~GT Release) | Comp (I vs. C), Off (I vs. C) |
- **Formatting (-1.0)**: R/A vs. **R, A** or **R,A**; - vs. –; no bolding on activities/roles; minor header spacing diffs.
- **Overall**: Good intent/structure but pervasive factual/RACI errors, additions/renames, and format issues demand severe deduction under "utmost strictness" (small errors = significant loss; here, many large ones). Equivalent to ~30% accuracy.
