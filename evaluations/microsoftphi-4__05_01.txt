3.0

The LLM answer misplaces the timer (intermediate catching between Task_Check and GW_Docs delays flow instead of enforcing timely progression), confuses boundary event usage on Task_Check (too late post-submission), and adds extraneous modifications to f3 with signals/messages (implying new event types, violating "no new activities" spirit). It fails to bypass directly to Task_Triage for auto-escalation, exceeding 120 words (~140), and doesn't ensure SLA compliance via interruption from submission (Start_Claim/Task_Receive). Ground truth is precise, reusing elements correctly; this is conceptually flawed with multiple errors.
