### Evaluation Rationale
- **Alignment with Ground Truth (Strict Assessment)**: The LLM answer partially captures the core elements but introduces significant deviations, expansions, and unsubstantiated inferences that violate the prompt's instruction to "not introduce any activities or artefacts that are not defined." The ground truth is concise, with exactly 3 decision points in a structured table format, focusing on branching logic without speculative questions, actors, or additional outcomes. The LLM expands to 5 decision points, adding details like specific "questions" (e.g., “Does the audit confirm the finance pre-approval?” for Senior_Auditor_Review), rejection/correction paths (e.g., "return for correction"), and an "implicit gate" for payment readiness—none of which are explicitly defined in the process description or reflected in the ground truth. This over-interpretation (e.g., treating Senior_Auditor_Review as a full approval decision rather than a required completion step) creates differences in content and structure, warranting a major deduction. The high-value branch is correctly identified but fragmented across points 3 and 4, mismatching the ground truth's integrated #2 point.
  
- **Documents List**: This section is a strong match (both list the exact 7 required documents: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail [with high-value caveat], BankTransferAuthorization, RefundConfirmationPDF). Minor differences in formatting (alphabetical vs. numbered) and phrasing (e.g., LLM omits the explicit "catalogue" note and closing disclaimer) are small but deduct points under strictness, as they slightly alter emphasis without adding extras.

- **Overall Fidelity and Errors**: Covers ~70% of the ground truth's essence (eligibility, threshold, approvals) but inflates with non-canonical details (e.g., consulting RefundRequestForm in decisions, "system rule" actor, "hold" outcomes), leading to noticeable divergence. No hallucinations of new artefacts, but the elaborations (e.g., who decides, detailed outcomes) exceed summarization. Strict scoring reflects this as a moderate failure: functional but not precise. Small errors like inconsistent € symbol formatting (minor) contribute to the sub-5.0 adjustment.
