The LLM answer correctly identifies that it is impossible to calculate the average cycle time for "Dual Authorization" due to the absence of timestamps. However, it contains a minor imprecision: the event log header does not "explicitly state that no timestamps were released"; rather, this is inferred from the absence of timestamp data in the artefacts provided. In contrast, the ground truth answer is clearer in specifying that only event counts are available and explains that the required intervals are absent.

This small error or lack of precision (misattributing the absence of timestamps to the event log header's explicit statement) results in a slight deduction. The answer is otherwise concise and correct.
