9.0

- For all three questions, the LLM answer provides the correct information.
- Only slight differences in formatting: punctuation (colon vs. no colon), and the LLM uses asterisks and markdown emphasis for activities, while the ground truth is a bit plainer.
- "Pack_Items" is returned for Q2 (correct), and "Cancel_Order" for Q3 (correct).
- The answer is concise and bullet-pointed, as requested.

**Penalty justification:**  
Despite perfect correctness, minor markdown-styling and punctuation deviates from the ground truth, and per "utmost strictness" and "Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," a small deduction is warranted.

**Final score:** 9.0
