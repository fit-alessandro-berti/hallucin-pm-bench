The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and structure: correct count of 3 distinct cases (with the same unique values, despite a non-alphabetical listing order, which is not an error as the question asks only for the count and implies uniqueness); exact match for the preceding activity ("Pack_Items"); and exact match for the unique activity ("Cancel_Order"). Minor formatting variations (e.g., backticks vs. parentheses, listing order) do not constitute errors under strict evaluation, as they preserve semantic equivalence and conciseness.
