7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Strengths (supporting higher score)**: Correct overall verdict ("Non-compliant"). Accurately identifies the two key violations (Rules 2 and 3) with precise event citations (#8 before #9 for Rule 2; #6 to #10 for Rule 3). Citations match ground truth. Format aligns with prompt ("Non-compliant" followed by numbered justifications citing relevant rules).
- **Weaknesses (deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Incompleteness (-1.5 points)**: Does not evaluate *all* rules as in ground truth (omits Rules 1, 4, 5, which are satisfied). Ground truth provides a full audit (1-5), noting satisfactions and a summary. This is a structural difference, reducing thoroughness.
  - **Factual error in Rule 3 (-1.0 point)**: States "distance is 4" (10-6=4); ground truth states "distance = 3" (likely activities between: 7,8,9). Small numerical mismatch reflects incorrect distance calculation per ground truth, warranting significant deduction per instructions.
- **No other major issues**: Rule 2 justification identical in substance. No hallucinations or wrong violations. Total deductions from 10.0 yield 7.5.
