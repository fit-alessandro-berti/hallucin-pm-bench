6.0

**Justification:**

- The LLM answer correctly lists the majority of the required documents, using almost verbatim naming, with minor variation ("Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" instead of the ground truth's "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months)"). This is minor but still a deviation.
- It omits the explicit point made in the ground truth that **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** itself is a decision point. The LLM answer only lists two decision points and omits this explicit step even though it is one of the process's critical approvals.
- It describes the *decision points* accurately for the two provided, but fails to strictly use the exact activity names and sequence specified in the process for the third (MBA).
- The bullet formatting for documents is fine, but in the "Latest Income Statement" item, the LLM answer says "single pay-stub or tax slip," while the ground truth lists "pay-stub/tax slip," a minor difference in wording (the required "single" isn't strictly necessary and could introduce confusion).
- The LLM answer contains some unnecessary meta-discussion (e.g. "Let's start by understanding what the user needs..."), when the question explicitly requested just the summary and list.
- The LLM answer omits the clarifying note present in the ground truth about what is *not* required. While not strictly required, its absence slightly reduces completeness.

**Major errors:** Omission of the third decision point ("Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)") is significant and should result in a substantial point loss.

**Minor errors:** Small deviations in document naming and sequencing; small ambiguity in paraphrasing; extra meta-discussion.

Hence, a 6.0 reflects: contains most requirements, but fails a key process requirement (omission of a decision point) and minor strictness issues in phrasing.
