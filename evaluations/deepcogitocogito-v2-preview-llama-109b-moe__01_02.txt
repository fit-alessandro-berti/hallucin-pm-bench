6.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Partial Credit, but Significant Omission - Deduction of 3.5 points)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the first two decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with accurate terminology and conditions, closely aligning with the ground truth's content and structure. However, it completely omits the third decision point (Final Micro-loan Board Approval/MBA), which is explicitly a binary decision (approve/reject) in the ground truth. This is a critical gap, as the prompt requires summarizing *all* decision points, and the process flow includes this as a key branch. The ground truth emphasizes its role post-threshold. Small structural differences (e.g., no mention of process branches like "after Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check") add minor inaccuracies, warranting strict penalty under the guidelines.

- **Required Documents (High Fidelity with Minor Phrasing Errors - Deduction of 0.5 points)**: The LLM lists all six required documents exactly as specified in the original prompt, using precise terminology without introducing extras. This matches the ground truth's complete list in content and order. However, the ground truth slightly rephrases three items (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" → "≤ 3 months"; adds "single" is dropped in income statement; "template" omitted from CIS) and includes an explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") that the LLM lacks. These small differences (fidelity to prompt vs. ground truth) result in a notable but not severe deduction, per strictness rules. No additions of standard loan terms, which is correct.

Overall, the LLM answer is structured clearly and adheres to the prompt's instructions (exact activity names, no standard terminology), but the missing decision point creates a substantive incompleteness, preventing a higher score.
