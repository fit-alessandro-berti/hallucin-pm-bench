### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment) as the ground truth, accurately quantifies SLA excesses (+300s for Risk Review and Legal Approval; +60s for Credit Assessment), and includes waiting times grounded in the table data. It uses bullet points solely for recommendations, as required, and stays within ~150 words while returning primarily memo text (minor extras like the footnote and "[Insert Date]" are small deductions but violate "only the memo text").

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Structure and formatting differences (significant penalty, -2.0)**: LLM uses a numbered list for activities and a generic title/To/From/Date, while ground truth employs bolded paragraphs for analysis, a specific Subject line referencing "Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)", and frames the intro around "4 805 completed cases" (an invention not derivable from the table, as case volumes are per-activity and cumulative starts at 1200). Order of activities differs slightly (LLM starts with Risk Review; ground truth with Legal Approval, arguably the joint worst due to highest wait time).
- **Recommendations mismatch (major penalty, -2.0)**: All three actions are entirely different from ground truth—e.g., LLM suggests parallel processing/cross-training for Risk Review vs. ground truth's added analyst/automation; NLP automation for Legal Approval vs. rule-based pre-checks; pre-screening/30% to juniors for Credit Assessment vs. straight-through heuristic for <€25k loans. While both attempt data-driven concreteness (e.g., LLM references volumes like 480 cases implicitly), they invent unrelated specifics (zones, NLP, €25k threshold) not grounded in the table, but the lack of alignment with ground truth's exact actions is a core failure.
- **Additional inventions and phrasing (-0.5)**: LLM's closing "Data indicates these actions directly address operational bottlenecks without altering target SLAs" mirrors ground truth's projection spirit but invents "bottlenecks" and SLA non-alteration phrasing without data support, unlike ground truth's specific "35% cycle time reduction" (also inventive, but the divergence counts).

Core identification and quantification earn baseline points, but deviations in recommendations, structure, and minor inventions prevent a higher score. Overall fidelity to ground truth is moderate at best.
