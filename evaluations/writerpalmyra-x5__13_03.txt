7.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (40% weight)**: Correct count (1). Matches ground truth factually (9.5/10), but verbose formatting deviates slightly from ground truth's minimal "1" (minor deduction).
- **Part 2 (60% weight)**: Under 120 words (good). Identifies core issue (small sample, 3 cases) but lacks ground truth's precision: no exact event count (14), time span (<2 hours), frequency swing (0%-7%), confidence interval, rare-event sampling error math, or data-specific near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and string-matching pitfalls. Introduces mild speculation ("system-wide triggers", "threshold-based routing") violating "no speculation" rule. Generic vs. data-tied (5.0/10).
- **Overall**: Strong on Q1, incomplete/shallow on Q2 despite ≤120 words constraint. Strict deduction for omissions and extras.
