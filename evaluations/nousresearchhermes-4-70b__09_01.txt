The LLM answer is concise, accurate, and strictly supported by the data. It correctly states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps or elapsed-time data, matching both the logic and spirit of the ground truth answer. The answer avoids speculation, gives an explicit reason for not being able to compute the requested value, and adheres to the requirement for a clear explanation. There are no differences or errors relative to the ground truth response.
