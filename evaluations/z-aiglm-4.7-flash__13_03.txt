**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Correct count (1). Minor deduction (-0.5) for unnecessary extra details (case reference, bolding/formatting slightly deviates from ground truth's minimal "1"), but strictly accurate. Partial: 9.5/10.
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Major deviations. Factual error: excerpt does **not** "focus specifically on Case 1002" (events mixed across 1001-1003). Misses core ground truth points (tiny sample=14 events/3 cases/<2hrs; frequency swing 0-7%; wide CI; sampling error for rares; synonyms/"Automatic" variants; strict/fuzzy matching risks). Adds forbidden speculation ("likely rare exception"). Explanation pushes wrong bias (overestimates commonality via "focus") vs. statistical unreliability. Overly narrative, not analytical. Partial: 2/10 → weighted failures drop score.
- **Overall**: Strict per instructions—cumulative differences (errors, omissions, speculation) yield low score despite Q1 strength. Word count compliant (~75 vs. ≤120).
