3.5

Rationale:

- R1: Correct.
- R2: Incorrect—LLM ignored that Change_Request after approvals mandates a new final approval, which shifts the "last required approval" to the *second* Manager_Approval, thus Ship_Goods is too early.
- R3: Correct.
- R4: Correct.
- R5: Incorrect—LLM failed to notice Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occur before new Manager_Approval after Change_Request.
- R6: Correct.
- Overall result: The LLM missed two major rule violations (R2, R5).

**Major errors in two rules, so severe deductions are warranted. Strictness and deduction for minor justification expansion as well.**
