4.0

### Evaluation Notes (for transparency, not part of score):
- **Strengths**: Correct status and overall conclusion for R1, R3, R4, R6. Justifications concise and mostly under 20 words. Overall NON-COMPLIANT is accurate due to at least one detected violation.
- **Weaknesses (major deductions for strictness)**: 
  - R2: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated); fails to recognize the new Manager_Approval (2025-03-07) as the "last required approval" post-Change_Request, making Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) untimely/non-compliant. This is a substantive misinterpretation of sequence and rule timing.
  - R5: Incorrect status (Compliant vs. Violated); overlooks that Ship_Goods (2025-03-05) and Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) are "further processing steps" occurring after Change_Request (2025-03-04) but before new Manager_Approval (2025-03-07). Justification ignores this sequence, missing the rule's core requirement.
- **Other**: Minor format alignment (table vs. list) but content-focused evaluation prioritizes accuracy. Two out of six rules have fully erroneous statuses and justifications, representing ~33% error rateâ€”severe under strict criteria, leading to significant point loss despite partial correctness.
