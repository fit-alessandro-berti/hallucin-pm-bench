3.5

The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in key aspects, warranting a low score under strict evaluation. Major differences include: (1) multiple non-interrupting timers (on three tasks) vs. a single interrupting timer (only on Task_Receive); (2) routing to a new Escalation End Event (prematurely ending the process without reaching Task_Triage) vs. direct flow to existing Task_Triage to enforce progression; (3) complex dynamic timeDate configuration with process variables vs. simple timeDuration PT48H; (4) failure to ensure the claim reaches Triage within 48 hours (escalation bypasses it entirely) vs. bypassing delays to meet the "must reach" requirement. These alter the core logic and add unnecessary elements, introducing errors in SLA compliance. Minor similarity in using boundary timers and referencing IDs provides minimal credit.
