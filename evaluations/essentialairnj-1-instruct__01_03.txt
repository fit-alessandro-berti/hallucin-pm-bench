**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Part (a) – Major failures (contributes ~60% penalty)**:
  - Identifies **7 items** as "decision points" vs. ground truth's **exactly 2** (Risk-based skip and TriVote). Fabricates non-decisions (e.g., Receive-Application, Assign-Deck-Reviewer, Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself, Request-Applicant-Confirmation, Finalize-Agreement) – this is hallucination/inaccurate interpretation of "decision point (gate or conditional branch)".
  - **Risk-based skip rule inverted and misphrased**: LLM states "Decision to proceed [to Manual-Underwriting-Review] only if risk is Low or Medium AND ≤ €250,000" – exactly opposite of ground truth ("bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review" if condition true). This is a critical logical error.
  - TriVote partially correct ("any two out of three" matches "at least two"), but diluted by extraneous list.
  - Fails "one sentence each" strictly (some are not sentences; overly verbose).

- **Part (b) – Significant incompleteness and errors (contributes ~35% penalty)**:
  - Lists **5 documents** vs. ground truth's **9**. Misses **Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow** (explicit "inputs" in step 3, first appearance order critical).
  - Fails to distinguish **Signed Offer Sheet 77** (step 8) as separate from **Offer Sheet 77** (step 7).
  - Order incorrect due to omissions (scorecards must precede Deck Memo).
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML), but incompleteness is a severe violation of "all documents... in the order they first appear".

- **Overall**: Partial credit for correctly naming real elements (e.g., TriVote rule gist, some docs like Form 14B/Deck Memo), but strictness demands near-perfect match. ~70% inaccuracy warrants low score; not 1.0 only due to no external fabrications.
