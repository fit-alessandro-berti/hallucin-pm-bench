**1.0**

The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth and strict rules: it modifies **three** `<bpmn:sequenceFlow>` elements (Flow_4, Flow_5, Flow_6) exceeding the "reverse the direction of **one**" limit; produces a multi-line diff instead of a **single hunk**; deviates entirely from the ground truth's attribute-only change (dueDate="P5D" to "P2D"); adds unrequired headers; and offers a different rationale, resulting in zero alignment.
