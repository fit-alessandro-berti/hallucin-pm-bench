**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Major errors (significant deductions)**: R1 status **wrong** (Violated vs. Compliant) + incorrect justification (R1 does not require re-approval for changes; misapplies R5). R2 status **wrong** (Compliant vs. Violated) + incorrect justification (ignores post-Change_Request Manager_Approval on 2025-03-07 as "last required approval"; Ship_Goods on 03-05 violates 2-day rule post-final approval).
- **Minor/partial matches**: R3, R4, R6 fully match status + justification similar/adequate (≤20 words). R5 status correct, but justification incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice before new approval).
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), format close (bolded status, concise), but 2/6 rules critically mismatched (33% accuracy on statuses), violating "utmost strictness" for even small errors. Equivalent to ~3/10 for rule-level precision.
