**8.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Part 1 (exact count)**: Perfect match (both identify 1 occurrence of “Manual Fraud Check”). No deduction.
- **Part 2 (explanation)**: Strong overlap in key ideas (tiny sample of 3 cases/1 day; unrepresentative of month-long log; 1 manual vs. automatic variants; label variations distorting estimates). Under 120 words. However, strict deductions for:
  - Missing precise quantification (GT: 14 events, <2 hours, 3 cases; swings 0%-7%; wide confidence interval; extreme sampling error for rare events).
  - Less statistical rigor (no % swing, confidence, or "one extra/missing line" volatility emphasis).
  - Slightly vaguer on time scope ("single day" vs. GT's "<2 hours"); no exact case/time reference (minor but noted).
  
Overall: High fidelity but lacks GT's analytical precision/depth (-2.0 points).
