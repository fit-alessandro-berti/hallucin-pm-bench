The LLM answer correctly lists all and only the parallel blocks from Process B, with accurate grouping of tasks. The only (minor) deviation from the ground truth is the absence of a space after the comma separating tasks (e.g., "Generate_CAD_Drawing,Confirm_Materials_Availability" rather than "Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability"). While this is a formatting/spacing issue and not a substantive error, it is a deviation from instructions and expected output formatting. As per the strict grading criteria requested, this warrants a loss of 1 point.
