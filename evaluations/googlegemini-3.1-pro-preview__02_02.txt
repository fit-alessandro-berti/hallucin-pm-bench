10.0

**Evaluation Reasoning** (strict line-by-line factual comparison):
- **Q1**: LLM "3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003)" vs. GT "**3**". Numerically exact; parenthetical list is correct (no fabrication) and responsive to "distinct cases" phrasing. No loss.
- **Q2**: Exact sequence match (Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order). GT escaping (\_) is formatting artifact; LLM matches prompt verbatim. No loss.
- **Q3**: Exact distinct activities ("Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"), one per line, alphabetically ordered (A→C). Matches GT content; minor GT formatting (-<br>) irrelevant to factual precision. No loss.

No extras, misses, hallucinations, or errors. Perfect fidelity.
