3.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") but contains major errors in the justification that deviate significantly from the ground truth: it incorrectly claims Rule 1 is violated (RA before QE, when QE precedes RA); misapplies Rule 2 as "not applicable" despite it being satisfied; and wrongly states Rule 4 is violated (CC before NA, when CC follows NA and VP). Only Rule 3 is accurately assessed as violated. These factual misreadings of the trace sequence warrant a low score for inaccuracy and lack of fidelity to the ruleset analysis.
