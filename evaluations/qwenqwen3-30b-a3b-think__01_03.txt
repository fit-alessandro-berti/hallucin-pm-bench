### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part (a) - Decision Points (Strong Match, ~9/10):** The LLM accurately identifies and summarizes the two key decision points with precise rules, closely aligning with the ground truth in content and structure. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "skip" vs. "bypasses"; "at least two approvals" vs. "at least two ... record 'Approve'") are present but do not alter meaning. The LLM's step references add clarity without contradicting the process. However, strictness deducts slightly for not exactly mirroring the ground truth's wording (e.g., no explicit "after Tri-Color-Risk-Check" context in the first point).

- **Part (b) - Documents List (Poor Match, ~2/10):** Major omissions and errors significantly diverge from the ground truth. The LLM misses the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), which are explicitly required as inputs/documents in Step 3 and listed separately in the ground truth's order (items 2â€“4). This is a critical failure, as the prompt requires *all* documents "required anywhere," and the ground truth treats these as such. The listed items (Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025) match 6/9 ground truth items in content and approximate order of first appearance, but the incomplete list (only 6 items vs. 9) and incorrect exclusion of Scorecards result in substantial loss. The LLM's notes justify the omission but contradict the ground truth's inclusion, further indicating misinterpretation.

**Overall Score Calculation:** Weighted average (a: 50%, b: 50% of prompt), strictly penalizing incompleteness and deviations. No hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC docs), but omissions are treated as equivalent to errors under strict criteria.
