The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall NON-COMPLIANT status and gets 5/6 rule statuses right (R1, R3, R4, R5, R6), with justifications mostly concise and under 20 words. However, it critically errs on R2 by deeming it Compliant and basing the justification solely on the initial Finance_Approval (ignoring the new Manager_Approval as the last required approval post-Change_Request, per R5 interplay), missing a key violation. This flaw in analysis, plus minor justification divergences (e.g., R5 less precise than ground truth), deducts significantly under strict evaluation.
