6.0

R1: Correct (Compliant, justified well).  
R2: Incorrect—marked as Compliant, but should be Violated, because Ship_Goods occurs before the required new Manager_Approval after Change_Request (final approval is 07-Mar but Ship_Goods is 05-Mar). This is a significant conceptual error.  
R3: Correct (Violated, correct justification).  
R4: Correct (Not Applicable, correct justification).  
R5: Correct (Violated, correct justification and correct explanation).  
R6: Correct (Compliant, correct justification).  
Overall: Correctly identifies NON-COMPLIANT.

Errors:  
- The answer misjudges R2, producing a substantive compliance analysis error.  
- Some justifications are correct but R2’s is not precise after change approval (should state final approval after change, not just initial approvals).

Strict penalization for a major error (R2) drops the score significantly, but other rules are handled with correct reasoning.
