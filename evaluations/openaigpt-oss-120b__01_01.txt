### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in completeness and fidelity to the process description—it correctly identifies all required documents without introducing extras and covers the core decision logic without fabricating activities. However, under utmost strictness, several differences from the ground truth (GT) warrant significant deductions:

- **Decision Points Structure and Content (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: 
  - GT uses a concise table focused on branching logic/outcomes (e.g., "Eligible → continue; Not eligible → claim rejected/returned"), emphasizing process flow. The LLM instead uses a more verbose table incorporating "what is decided" and per-point documents, which adds unrequested details and deviates from GT's format/logic-only focus. This introduces extraneous elements (e.g., documents table within decisions), bloating the response beyond a pure summary.
  - GT's #3 ("Final payment approval" combining PreApprove and Senior_Auditor_Review with explicit reject → end) is a unified decision point on approval leading to payment. The LLM fragments this: #2 covers only PreApprove's approve/reject, #3 is just the "high-value branch" (framed as implicit after PreApprove), and the note vaguely implies gating without listing it as a distinct point. This misses GT's holistic "final approval" framing, creating incomplete branching coverage (e.g., no explicit rejection at Auditor level).
  - Wording differences: LLM's "Is the claim eligible? (Yes / No)" and "Approve / Reject" are close but not identical to GT's outcome-oriented phrasing (e.g., no explicit "claim rejected/returned"). The "implicit decision" label for #3 is interpretive, not in GT.

- **Documents List (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**:
  - Both list all 7 exact documents without additions, and both note no legacy activities. However, LLM expands into a table with "when created or used" (e.g., specifying AuditTrail as "produced/attached" or BankTransferAuthorization as "required before"), adding interpretive details not present in GT's simple numbered list. GT only qualifies AuditTrail as "only for claims > €1 000, but still part," which LLM echoes but embeds in a fuller description. This is extra elaboration, not a bare "list."

- **Overall Adherence and Strictness (Minor Deduction: -0.3 points)**:
  - The LLM's note and closing statement are accurate summaries but introduce phrasing like "gated by the outcomes" and "These lists capture every... no additional," which go beyond GT's succinct "(No other documents or legacy activities...)"—mild over-explanation.
  - No hallucinations, but the response is not a near-verbatim match in structure, brevity, or precision, leading to noticeable divergence. Total alignment ~72% (strong on facts, weaker on format and unification).

A perfect 10.0 requires near-identical structure, wording, and separation of concerns; this is a solid but imperfect match.
