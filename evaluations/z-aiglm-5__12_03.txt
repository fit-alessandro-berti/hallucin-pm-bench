The LLM answer is factually perfect, fully accurate, and directly fulfills the task requirements (Yes/No answer + justification citing relevant CaseIDs C001–C004 and precise activity sequences with timestamps for evidence). It correctly identifies the two counterexamples (C002, C004) refuting "always," notes compliance in the other cases (C001, C003), and relies solely on the log. Stylistic differences (text list vs. table, minor phrasing) are superficial and do not impact correctness, completeness, or adherence to the prompt under strict evaluation—content matches ground truth in substance with no errors or omissions.
