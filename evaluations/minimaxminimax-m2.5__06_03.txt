The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B in the correct order, with precise task names matching the prompt's description. It adheres strictly to the user instructions by focusing solely on Process B and providing no extraneous information.  

**Strict deductions (total -0.8):**  
- Minor formatting deviation: Uses "**Parallel Construct #1**" headers with bullets instead of exact "1. **Set 1 – first parallel block:**" numbered list style (-0.3). Prompt specifies "Number the sets," which is satisfied by #1/#2 but not identically to ground truth.  
- Lacks `backticks` around task names and ‖ parallel symbol (-0.3).  
- Omits descriptive phrases like "first parallel block" and closing "No other tasks..." sentence (-0.2), though not explicitly required by prompt.  

Semantically perfect; deductions only for stylistic mismatches under utmost strictness.
