9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, with all answers matching the ground truth in substance and detail:

- **Q1:** The answer "3 distinct cases" is correct.
- **Q2:** The sequence "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order" is perfectly accurate and formatted as requested.
- **Q3:** The response lists "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock", one per line, alphabetically ordered—correct as per the ground truth.

**Minor Issues Noted:**
- Some explanatory text (e.g., the sentences describing reasoning or citing line numbers) is present, whereas the ground truth is strictly concise answers. While this doesn't alter the factual correctness, it is extra and was not requested, and strict grading should penalise for verbosity that could potentially introduce noise or distraction.
- In Q3, the phrase "alphabetically ordered: 'Arrange_Delivery' comes before 'Check_Stock'", while true, is a redundant explanatory comment that is not in the ground truth.

**No actual errors in the answers provided**; only small format/explanation issues. This justifies a slight deduction, resulting in **9.0**.
