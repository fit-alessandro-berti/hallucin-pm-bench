3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology (perfect, +2.0 base)**: Uses exact "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance" with correct capitalization; no forbidden terms. Matches ground truth and policy.
- **Structure & Unwarranted Content (-3.0)**: Introduces extra title ("RACI Matrix — Order-to-Cash..."), legend, column labels with abbreviations "(AM)" etc., "(row)" note. Ground truth has clean headers (no abbrevs/parentheticals), no title/legend. Bold formatting mismatches (no activity bolds on mandated terms; **R/A** vs **R / A** or **R**).
- **RACI Correctness (major failures, -4.0)**: Core mismatches vs. ground truth (narrative reflection per notes):
  | Activity | Diff Count | Details |
  |----------|------------|---------|
  | Receive Application | Minor (1) | **R/A** vs **R / A** (formatting only). |
  | KYC Review | Major (3) | AM: C vs A; CO: **R/A** vs **R**; FC: I vs C. |
  | Order Vetting | Match | - |
  | Payment Clearance | Major (4) | AM: I vs A; CO: I vs C; FC: **R/A** vs **R**; IT: C vs I. |
  | Record Update | Minor (1) | IT: **R/A** vs **R** (unwarranted A). |
  | Notify Customer | Match | - |
  - Total: 9 cell differences (30%+ of matrix). Violates "exactly one Responsible" nuance (extra A's); ignores specified consults/accountables (e.g., AM as A for manager-led steps).
- **Overall**: 40% matrix accuracy; small formatting/header issues compound under strictness (-significant per error). No self-awareness issues. Final: 3.0 (partial credit for terms/structure/3 matching rows; heavy deductions for RACI errors).
