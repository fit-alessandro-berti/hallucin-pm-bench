**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in structure, content, and accuracy: correct "No" verdict, exhaustive case-by-case analysis of all 4 cases (C001-C004), precise sequences citing intervening activities (*Pack_Items* in C002, *Check_Fraud* in C004), and valid conclusion that "always" fails due to counterexamples. Stylistic differences (e.g., table headers, bolding, extra summary phrasing, markdown headers) are superficial and do not alter facts, citations, or compliance with the task's "Answer Yes/No + Justify with CaseIDs/sequences" requirements. No errors or omissions.
