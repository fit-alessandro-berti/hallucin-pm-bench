9.2

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment against ground truth):
- **Q1**: Matches exactly in substance (`1` occurrence/time). Minor deduction (-0.1) for extra verbose phrasing not matching GT's concise "`1` occurrence".
- **Q2**: Correct calculation and value (5.56%). Minor deductions (-0.2 total): no space before `%` (GT: `5.56 %`), lacks inline calculation formula (GT: `$1 ÷ 18 × 100 = 5.56$ %`), extra explanatory parenthetical.
- **Q3**: Exact match in substance (only A1002). Negligible phrasing difference ("Case(s) containing... **A1002**" vs. "Only case **A1002** contains..."); no deduction.
- **Q4**: Provides exactly two clear, sampling-related reasons aligning with GT options (small sample size + temporal bias in first; non-random sampling akin to case-mix bias in second). Significant deductions (-0.5 total): lacks GT's specific details/examples (e.g., variance "±5.56 pp.", "morning of 1 May 2025", "high-risk segments", "survivorship/truncation"); reasons combine concepts without precise matching bullets; introduces "across days" redundancy.

Overall: Excellent fidelity (no hallucinations, all derivable from log), but strict penalties for conciseness, formatting, and Q4 specificity yield 9.2 (very high, yet not perfect).
