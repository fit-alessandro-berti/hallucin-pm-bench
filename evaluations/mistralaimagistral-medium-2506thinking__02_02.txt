The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth content exactly for all three questions: distinct cases (3), sequence for C002 (correct activities in order), and preceding activities for Ship_Order (Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock, alphabetically ordered). No hallucinations, missing elements, or factual errors. However, under strict evaluation, minor differences include extraneous summary text (e.g., listing all cases unasked), additional boxed formatting not in the ground truth (e.g., isolated \boxed{3}, comma-separated Q3 variant), and slight format deviations in Q3 presentation (plain lines vs. bulleted<br> in ground truth), warranting a small deduction for unnecessary extras and non-exact alignment.
