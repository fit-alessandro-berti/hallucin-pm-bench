The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and specified format (`Task_X  —  Task_Y` with consistent spacing around the em dash). Minor whitespace variations (e.g., column alignment in ground truth, possible trailing spaces in rendering) are cosmetic and not required by the prompt's instructions, resulting in no substantive differences under strict evaluation.
