**2.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Vocabulary compliance (perfect, +2.5/2.5)**: Uses exactly the 4 mandated terms ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") with no synonyms, leaks, or alternatives. Matches policy strictly.
- **Completeness of activities (-3.0/3.0)**: Covers only 4/6 activities from ground truth (misses "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds", both explicitly described in narrative: escalation/approval for high-risk, Treasury Ops scheduling/release/notifies). Fails "covering **every activity**"; does not infer/expand as required without "renaming/merging/adding" violation.
- **RACI assignments (-2.5/2.5)**: Major errors across all rows vs. ground truth:
  | Activity | Key Differences |
  |----------|-----------------|
  | Intake Vetting | Missing Compliance Analyst "C"; Front-Office not "A"; no Compliance Officer. |
  | KYC Review | Compliance Analyst "R" only (not "R,A"); Officer "A" (should be "C"). |
  | AML Screening | Same as KYC (swapped R/A vs. ground truth). |
  | Risk Scoring | Missing Front-Office Analyst "C". |
  No coverage of missing rows exacerbates.
- **Format/Structure (-1.5/2.0)**: Markdown table OK, roles complete, but adds unauthorized title ("### RACI Matrix..."); spells out full words (e.g., "Responsible") instead of standard R/A/C/I abbreviations + multiples (e.g., "R, A"); blanks cells instead of "–"; minor bold/header inconsistencies.
- **Overall fidelity**: ~40% match (vocab saves it from 1.0); small errors (e.g., cell fillings, missing "C"/"I") compounded by incompleteness = significant deductions. Utmost strictness applied.
