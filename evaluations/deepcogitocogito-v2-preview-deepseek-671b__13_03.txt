7.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Question 1 (50% weight)**: Perfect match. LLM correctly identifies exactly 1 occurrence in case 1002, with no errors or speculation. (10/10)
- **Question 2 (50% weight)**: Partial match. LLM captures core ideas like small sample size (3 cases), unrepresentative 33% rate, lack of patterns/triggers, and distinction from automatic checks (e.g., near-synonyms). However, it exceeds ideal conciseness with redundant listing (>120 words in full response), adds speculation (e.g., "seasonal variations," "policy changes," "high-risk triggers") violating "no speculation" rule, and omits key ground truth elements: event count (14), time span (<2 hours), percentage swing (0% to 7% per event), confidence intervals, and fuzzy matching risks. These omissions and extras cause significant deviation. (5/10)

Overall: Strong on facts but weaker on precision and adherence, per strict criteria.
