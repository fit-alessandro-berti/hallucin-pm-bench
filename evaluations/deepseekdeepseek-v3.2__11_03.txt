### Evaluation Rationale
**Strengths (driving high score):**
- Perfect match on core requirement: identifies **exact same three activities** (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as worst-performing based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times.
- Perfect quantification of SLA exceedances: identical calculations and phrasing structure (e.g., Legal Approval +300s on 900s throughput vs. 600s SLA, waits cited precisely from table).
- Compliant structure: Memo format with headers, paragraph analysis, **bullets only for recommendations** (one per activity, data-driven by explicitly targeting measured waiting times as breach drivers).
- No inventions: Stays 100% grounded in table data (no fabricated totals, dates, projections, or external details like "€25k loans").
- Word count ≈170 (close to 150 target).

**Weaknesses (point deductions, strict per instructions):**
- Headers/subject differ (e.g., "COO" vs. "Chief Operating Officer"; "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. "Process Performance Office"; subject less specific, -0.3).
- Lacks derived total cases (~4805 from summing Cases column, emphasized in GT intro, -0.4).
- Intro phrasing/structure less punchy/formatted (no bold metrics/activity names, no "queues" synonym for waits, -0.5).
- Recommendations **qualitatively similar** (target waits driving breaches) but **textually divergent** and less concrete/specific (-0.8): LLM generic ("reallocate resources," "queue management," "streamline workflow") vs. GT's actionable ("rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst + automate," "straight-through heuristic").
- Minor: No closing projection/impact summary (-0.3); slight over-wordiness.

**Overall:** 80%+ alignment on facts/requirements, but stylistic, phrasing, and rec specificity gaps deduct ~2.3 points under utmost strictness. Core fidelity high; recs fulfill "concrete, data-driven" minimally but not matching GT.
