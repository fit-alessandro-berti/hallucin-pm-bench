### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correct identification of changes (high marks)**: The LLM accurately detects the added tasks (`check_vip`, `generate_qr`), removed task (`send_rma_label`), and gateway type change for `gw_valid` (from exclusive to inclusive). No extraneous or speculative differences are included, aligning with the prompt's focus on factual XML differences.
- **Deductions for format and detail mismatches (significant loss per strictness)**: 
  - Task listings use only IDs, omitting the full `name` attributes (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status" instead of just `check_vip`), which are factual elements in the XML and explicitly included in the ground truth. This is a notable omission, reducing clarity and fidelity.
  - Gateway description is concise but lacks the ground truth's explicit "changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)" phrasing, including version references for context.
  - Headings use "###" markdown instead of the prompt's implied plain/exact text (matching ground truth's "**bold**" style), a minor but strict formatting deviation.
- No other errors (e.g., no hallucinated changes), but the incomplete task descriptions prevent a perfect score. Overall, core accuracy is strong, but strict comparison to ground truth warrants deductions.
