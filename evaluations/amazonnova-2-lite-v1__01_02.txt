6.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Issues, ~60% match)**: LLM correctly identifies and describes 2/3 ground truth decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) with high fidelity to terminology and logic, including exact phrasing like "≤ 2 points", "Harmonisation Committee", "< €15 000", "≥ €15 000", "system auto-approves", and "Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)". However:
  - **Critical omission**: Entirely misses the 3rd decision point (**Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – board votes *Approve* or *Reject*). This is a core branch/decision in the process flow (step 8), explicitly listed in ground truth. -3.0 points.
  - Minor inaccuracy in Amount Threshold: Specifies "proceeds to **Disburse Funds**" for < €15 000 (introduces non-decision step 9, not in ground truth phrasing) and omits context "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check". -0.5 points.
  - Adds extra details like "continue to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**" (accurate per process but not in ground truth summary style). Neutral.
  - No mention of positions/contexts like "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split". -0.5 points.
- **Required Documents (Near-perfect, ~95% match)**: Complete list of all 6 items with exact matches to prompt terminology (e.g., "Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet", "Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)"). Minor phrasing deviations from ground truth:
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" vs. "(≤ 3 months)" – unnecessary "old". -0.2.
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" vs. "(pay-stub/tax slip)" – adds "single ... or". -0.2.
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" – retains "template" from prompt, ground truth omits. -0.1.
  - Omits ground truth's extra note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*") – not required by prompt, but adds distinctiveness. Neutral.
- **Overall Structure/Style**: Uses bullet-like formatting with bolding (functional but differs from ground truth's "####" headers and italics). Follows prompt's "exactly the activity names" and avoids standard terminology. No major hallucinations.
- **Strict Scoring**: Starts at 10.0, deduct for incompleteness (-3.0), inaccuracies/context omissions (-1.0), phrasing diffs (-0.5), structure variance (-0.5) → 5.0 base, partial credit for precision/completeness of covered elements (+1.0) = 6.0. Small errors amplified per instructions; missing core decision point prevents higher score.
