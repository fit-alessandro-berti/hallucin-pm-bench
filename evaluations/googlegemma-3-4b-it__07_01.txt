7.5

The LLM answer is close to the ground truth, but not fully BPMN-XML precise: 

- It gives the correct new tasks but omits the element IDs, as required ("use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML"); this is a notable error as per instructions.
- Similarly, under "Removed tasks" it lists only the name, not the XML element name/id.
- The "Gateway type changes" does not name the specific element (`gw_valid`), as the ground truth answer does.
- Headings do not match required styling (**bolded**) but appear clear enough.

Numerous small precision errors as above merit points off, but the factual differences are otherwise identified and no speculations or extraneous claims are introduced. Thus, a 7.5 reflects solid factual identification but with meaningful docstring/exactness issues.
