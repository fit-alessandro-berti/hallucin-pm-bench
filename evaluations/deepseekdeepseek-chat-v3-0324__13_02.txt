The LLM answer is nearly perfect: questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly in content, calculation, and formatting (including rounding and percentages). For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (68 words), explicitly addresses low support via "rare instances" (implying the single occurrence from Q1), notes instability/variance through skew in metrics and sampling bias/outliers, and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., overestimating impact, false associations). It loses 0.5 points for not directly stating "single occurrence" (as in ground truth) or referencing specific stats like cycle time/confidence intervals, though requirements are substantively met.
