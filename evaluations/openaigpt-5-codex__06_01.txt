The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (both within pairs and overall list), and core format (one pair per line with the specified em dash separator). Minor whitespace variations (e.g., lack of vertical alignment of the em dashes) do not constitute an error under the prompt's specified format, as alignment is not required.
