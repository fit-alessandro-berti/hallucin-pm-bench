A1: Perfect. "There are 3 distinct cases: C001, C002, and C003." Exactly matches the ground truth.

A2: The LLM answer (“Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order”) is the correct chronological sequence for case C002. The format is as requested.

A3: The LLM answer:
• Arrange_Delivery
• Check_Stock

These are the correct distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order", and are alphabetically ordered. However, there is a minor formatting issue: the prompt specifically requested to use underscores (as found in the raw event log and the ground truth), e.g., Arrange_Delivery not Arrange Delivery. However, in the LLM's output, the underscores are omitted. This is a small, but material, formatting error.

Since the instruction is to grade with the utmost strictness, and small errors should reflect in a significant loss of points, this formatting deviation warrants a 1-point deduction.

Final score: 9.0
