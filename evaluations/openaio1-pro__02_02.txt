The LLM answer is factually precise and matches the ground truth exactly in content for all three questions, with no missing, extra, or fabricated elements. Minor differences are limited to phrasing (e.g., introductory text like "There are 3 distinct cases" for A1 or "the activities in chronological order are" for A2) and bullet formatting (â€¢ vs. -), which do not alter the core answers. Alphabetical ordering for A3 is correct (Arrange_Delivery before Check_Stock). No deductions are warranted under strict evaluation, as there are no errors, hallucinations, or deviations in the required outputs.
