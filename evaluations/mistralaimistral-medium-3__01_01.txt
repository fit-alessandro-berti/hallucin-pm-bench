7.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in structure and completeness for the documents list, which matches the ground truth exactly (all 7 items listed, with appropriate conditional note for *AuditTrail* and disclaimer on no legacy activities). It correctly identifies the two primary explicit decision points (eligibility validation and high-value threshold branch) with similar outcomes and branching logic. However, under utmost strictness, significant point deductions are warranted for the following errors and differences in the decision points summary:

- **Misplacement and misrepresentation of the third decision point (major error, -1.5 points)**: The LLM incorrectly frames a "decision" at *Process_Refund_Payment* as checking prerequisites (which is merely a conditional gate per the process constraints, not an active decision activity). This introduces a non-decision step as a decision point, diverging from the ground truth's accurate placement of the final approval/rejection logic at the core approval activities (*Finance_Controller_PreApprove* / *Senior_Auditor_Review*). The ground truth correctly ties approval outcomes directly to process progression/end, aligning better with implied success/failure in "signs off" and "review." This alters the process flow interpretation.

- **Minor inaccuracies in phrasing/outcomes (small errors, -0.5 points each, total -1.0)**: 
  - First decision: Adds specific documents (*FlightManifest*, *WeatherReport*) not emphasized in the ground truth's concise "eligibility check," slightly over-interpreting beyond pure summary (though not introducing undefined elements).
  - Second decision: Uses "route to" and "proceed directly" vs. ground truth's "include" and "skip," which is semantically close but less precise in reflecting the linear process with optional step. Also implies direct post-branch payment without reiterating approval success, unlike ground truth's integrated approval logic.
  - Outcomes include unprompted rejection details at triage (matches ground truth intent but phrased as "rejected" vs. "rejected/returned," a trivial variance but still a difference).

- **Structural and completeness differences (minor, -0.5 points)**: Uses a bulleted list instead of a table for decisions, making branching logic less tabular and comparable. While comprehensive, it doesn't as tightly mirror the ground truth's "Branching logic / outcomes" format, reducing fidelity.

The answer adheres to the prompt by not introducing undefined activities/artefacts and covers all elements, avoiding a lower score. Overall, it's 75% aligned (strong on facts/documents, weaker on precise decision framing), but strict criteria penalize the core discrepancies in decision analysis as the prompt's focus.
