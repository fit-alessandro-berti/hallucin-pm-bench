**7.2**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (40% weight)**: Exact match on count (1). Minor deduction (-0.2) for unsolicited CaseID detail (accurate but extraneous, deviates from ground truth's brevity).
- **Q2 (60% weight)**: Partial alignment (small sample, non-representative, high apparent rate). Covers ~60% of ground truth concepts (tiny size/time, sampling bias). Significant deductions for:
  - Missing core data-driven point: near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”) causing strict/fuzzy matching distortion (-1.5).
  - Divergent metrics (33% cases vs. ground truth's 7% events/wide CI) (-0.6).
  - Speculative additions (peaks, fraud patterns, incomplete traces) violating "no speculation" (-0.4).
  - Less precise stats (no event count 14, CI, rare-event error) (-0.3).
- Total: Strong on basics but strict loss for omissions/errors yields 7.2 (good but flawed vs. ground truth). Under 120 words: compliant.
