5.0

**Evaluation:**

### a) Decision Points

- The LLM answer correctly identifies both decision points:
    1. The conditional skip/bypass based on risk rating and amount,
    2. The TriVote approval gate.
- The explanations are accurate and match the ground truth, including correct logical conditions and the meaning of "at least two of three" approvals.

**Minor issues:**
- Wording is slightly less precise than the ground truth (e.g., "Pass to Prepare-Binding-Offer" versus "the loan may advance").
- The LLM does not as clearly tie the "otherwise" path (i.e., rejection at TriVote, or moving to Manual-Underwriting) in the most explicit possible way.
- There is no explicit statement that the Sustainability Officer's vote is always required (which is important context but not strictly the decision rule).

**Loss: -0.5**

### b) Required Documents

- **Major error:** The LLM omits the three Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) entirely, but these are formally "documents" per the process and listed in the ground truth.
- **Major error:** The LLM omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77," which is a distinct document (not just a signed version, but a collected artifact per the process step); ground truth lists it.
- The ordering for those that *are* listed matches for the included ones (Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025).
- The LLM provides commentary about "Scorecard inputs" not counting as documents, which is a misreading of the process description and contradicts the ground truth.

**Loss: -2.5 (scorecards) -1.0 (signed offer sheet)**

---

### Other Observations:

- The LLM follows instructions about not including KYC/AML documentation, which is correct.
- The answer formats and labels its components clearly.

### Total Deductions: -4.0 (Documents) -0.5 (Decisions) = -4.5  
### Starting from 9.5 for format/completeness, but the major document omissions are significant.
