### Evaluation Rationale
- **Part a) (Decision Points)**: The LLM accurately identifies and summarizes the two decision points in one sentence each, closely mirroring the ground truth in content, phrasing, and rules (e.g., Low/Medium risk + ≤ €250,000 skips step 5; at least two approvals in TriVote to pass). Minor deductions for unnecessary step numbering (not in ground truth), specifying "proceed to step 5" (ground truth uses "proceeds to that review"), and adding "otherwise, reject" (implied but not explicit in process or ground truth, which focuses on advancement condition). This is ~90% match, but strictness requires point loss for these additions/omissions.
- **Part b) (Documents)**: Severe inaccuracies. The LLM lists only 5 documents, omitting the three Scorecards (explicitly named as inputs/documents in Step 3, included in ground truth) and treating "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as non-new (ground truth lists it separately as a distinct document in Step 8). Order is mostly correct for listed items, but the exclusions are unjustified (Scorecards are "Documents" per prompt structure; signing creates a new required item). The LLM's explanatory note correctly avoids KYC/AML but hallucinates Scorecards as "data sources" and merges signed offer—major errors, reducing to ~50% match.
- **Overall**: Strong on a), but b)'s omissions (4/9 items missing) dominate as a core requirement, warranting heavy penalty under strict criteria. No hallucinations beyond exclusions, but completeness is critical.
