The LLM answer correctly identifies the "No" verdict and provides a valid, accurate counterexample from case C003 (lines 6-7), fully disproving the "always" claim with precise citations including timestamps. However, under utmost strictness, it loses significant points for incompleteness: it omits the equally critical counterexample in case C005 (line 11, Validate_Payment without any Receive_Order in that case), which the ground truth explicitly highlights as a second clear violation. This partial justification, while logically sufficient, deviates from the ground truth's more comprehensive coverage of counterexamples, resulting in a non-exact match. Minor formatting differences (e.g., no bolding, single paragraph vs. bullets) contribute minimally to the deduction.
