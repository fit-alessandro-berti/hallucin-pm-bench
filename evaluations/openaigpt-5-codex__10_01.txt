The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without forbidden variants and maintains the core process steps as rows and roles as columns, with no extra content introduced. However, it fails significantly on correctness of RACI allocations, which must reflect the narrative and ground truth: multiple rows lack the exact one Responsible per activity, include incorrect assignments (e.g., AM as C for KYC Review instead of A; AM as I for Payment Clearance instead of A), and leave numerous blanks where Consult (C) or Informed (I) roles are required (e.g., no C/I for CO/FC/IT in Receive Application; missing FC C and IT I in Payment Clearance). Formatting deviates (e.g., A/R vs. **R / A**; role abbreviations in headers; no bolding on key activities or R/A entries), introducing unwarranted variations. These errors, even if partially inferable from the sparse narrative, result in a matrix that is incomplete and mismatched to the ground truth in over 60% of cells, warranting a low score under strict evaluation.
