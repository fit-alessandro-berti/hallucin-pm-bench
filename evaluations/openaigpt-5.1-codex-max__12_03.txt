**9.5**

The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides accurate justification citing the two relevant counterexample CaseIDs (C002 and C004) with precise activity sequences and timestamps, directly addressing the task requirements and disproving the "always" claim via evidence from the log. This is fully sufficient and error-free.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for:
- Lack of exhaustive case-by-case analysis of *all* cases (omits confirming C001 and C003 as compliant, unlike ground truth's comprehensive table).
- Simpler format without the tabular structure or explicit summary of violation count ("two out of four"), reducing meticulousness slightly despite matching the task's "relevant CaseIDs" focus.
