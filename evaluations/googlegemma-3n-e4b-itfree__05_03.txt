3.0

- The LLM answer misapplies BPMN semantics by attempting to directly add a timer onto a sequence flow via a non-standard `<bpmn:timerRef>`. This is not allowed in BPMN 2.0; timers cannot be attached to sequence flows, only as intermediate catch events or boundary events.
- The correct solution is a boundary timer event attached to the "Create Account in Core System" task, as in the ground truth answer.
- The LLM fails to leverage the pre-existing escalation activity ("Activity_AMReview"), instead providing an inadequate enforcement mechanism with no escalation path on expiration.
- The justification references enforcement of the SLA, but the actual XML would not work in a BPMN engine, and does not guarantee escalation or SLA tracking as required.
- The LLM violates the instruction to use only valid BPMN constructs, misuses timer logic, and does not connect to escalation; these are not minor errors.
- There is no evidence of the required 48-hour boundary enforcement in a manner compatible with BPMN tools.

Points are awarded for targeting the correct area (between verification and account creation) and for noting the purpose of a timer, but the technical application is fundamentally wrong and non-functional in real BPMN 2.0. Thus, a severe penalty is warranted.
