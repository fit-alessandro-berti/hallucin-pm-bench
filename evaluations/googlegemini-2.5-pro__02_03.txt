9.0

- The LLM answer is nearly correct and concise.
- For Q1, it says "3" instead of specifying "3 cases" and listing (C123, C456, C789) as in the ground truth. This lack of explicitness costs it 1 point.
- Q2 and Q3 match the ground truth exactly.
- No significant factual mistakes, but strict grading did require more precision/explicitness in Q1.
