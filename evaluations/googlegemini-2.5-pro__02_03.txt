10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct, concise, and matches the ground truth content exactly in bullet-point format as instructed, with no factual errors or omissions in the required responses. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., no labels or case listing in A1) do not constitute errors, as the question only asks for the count, and the prompt emphasizes conciseness.
