The LLM answer correctly identified the two valid parallel pairs from Process B, and put each pair in alphabetical order internally. The pairs are output in the right order. However, the answer uses asterisks (*) to create a bullet-point list, rather than strictly following the specified format of one pair per line without bullets. The ground truth expects:

```
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines
```

But the LLM writes:

* Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
* Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

Additionally, the spacing between the task names and the "—" differs from the ground truth, and the output format explicitly requires alignment and no bullets. According to the instructions ("utmost strictness. Also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points"), this error, though minor in content, is significant in format compliance.

Thus, the answer is very close but does not exactly match on output format, so a point is deducted: **9.0**.
