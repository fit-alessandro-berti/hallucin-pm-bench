The LLM answer correctly answers Q1 ("Yes") and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) as the ground truth, demonstrating T5 firing before T3 by preserving the P2 token via the alternative path. The explanation accurately captures the key mechanism (retaining P2 token while reaching P5), staying under 120 words. Minor deductions for lacking explicit markings (M₁ to M₅) and detailed post-T5 disablement of T3, plus slight formatting integration of Q2 under Q1, but no factual errors or substantive deviations.
