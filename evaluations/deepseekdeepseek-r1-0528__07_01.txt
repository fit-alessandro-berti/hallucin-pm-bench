6.5

### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), aligning with the XML snippets and ground truth content. No speculation or extra items are included, which is strong.

However, under strict evaluation criteria:
- **Headings mismatch (major deduction, -2.0 points)**: The prompt requires exact headings like "â€¢ Added tasks", but the LLM uses "#### Added tasks" under an extraneous "### Changes Summary". This deviates from the specified structure.
- **Item formatting inconsistencies (moderate deduction, -1.0 point)**: The ground truth presents names first (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"), while the LLM reverses this to IDs first (e.g., "- `check_vip` (Check Customer VIP Status)"). Bullet styles differ (dashes vs. asterisks), and the gateway description omits version labels "(v1)" and "(v2)" for explicitness.
- **Minor omissions (slight deduction, -0.5 point)**: No inclusion of the ground truth's closing note, though not strictly required; phrasing for gateway is less precise without bolding or version tags.

These formatting and exactness issues, while not altering facts, warrant significant point loss per the instructions, resulting in a score below perfect. A higher score would require pixel-perfect adherence to heading style, order, and phrasing.
