The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth answer in facts and structure. All substantive differences present between the two XML snippets are accounted for, grouped under the correct exact headings, and using correct element names as in the XML.

Minor issues:
- The LLM omits the explicit id ("id = ...") notation next to each task in the lists for "Added tasks" and "Removed tasks," whereas the ground truth provides this for extra clarity. According to the prompt, "Use the element names exactly as they appear in the XML." While the id is present in the element name in the LLM answer, the format does not match the ground truth as strictly as possible, so a minor but significant deduction is warranted.

Overall, the answer is factually complete and correct, but per the specified demand for utmost strictness and even small errors resulting in loss of points, a small deduction is necessary.

Final score: **9.5**
