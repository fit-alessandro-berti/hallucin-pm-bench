The LLM answer correctly identifies the "No" response and provides a valid counter-example from case C003 with precise line citations and timestamps, directly contradicting the "always follows" claim in a concise paragraph as required. However, it omits the second key counter-example in case C005 (lines 11-12), where Validate_Payment occurs without any prior Receive_Order, which the ground truth explicitly highlights as additional proof of the claim's falsehood. This incompleteness represents a notable difference in thoroughness and coverage of evidence, warranting a deduction despite the partial accuracy; under strict evaluation, full alignment with the ground truth's comprehensive justification would be necessary for a higher score.
