### Evaluation Rationale
With utmost strictness, the LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in the core requirement of summarizing **decision points**, which are explicitly the branching or final verdict steps (only three in the process: Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval). The LLM incorrectly expands this to include non-decisionary steps (e.g., Quick KYC Verification, Community Impact Assessment, Dual Underwriter Split, Neighbourhood Feedback Check), treating linear activities as "decision points" despite the prompt's emphasis on exact terminology and flow. This introduces extraneous content, dilutes focus, and mismatches the ground truth's precise, numbered structure with positional context (e.g., "after Dual Underwriter Split"). Phrasing also varies slightly (e.g., "send to" vs. "proceed to" in Amount Threshold), compounding errors.

The required documents section is stronger but not flawless: it matches completeness and uses prompt-exact phrasing (e.g., "single pay-stub or tax slip," "(CIS) template"), but omits the ground truth's helpful disclaimer ("No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed"), which reinforces the non-standard process per the system prompt. Minor wording tweaks (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months") are allowable as negligible, but the absence of the disclaimer shows incomplete fidelity.

Overall differences: ~70% mismatch in decision points (major conceptual error), ~90% alignment in documents (minor omissions). This warrants a low score; even partial accuracy in one section cannot offset fundamental inaccuracies in the other, per strict evaluation criteria.
