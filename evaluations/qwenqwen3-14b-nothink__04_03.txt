4.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately flags the violation of Rule 3 (NA occurring before RA). However, it contains significant errors that deviate from the ground truth: it incorrectly claims Rule 1 is violated (QE does precede RA, satisfying the order requirement, despite the intervening NA); it erroneously describes Rule 2 as "violated indirectly" (VP actually occurs after both QE and RA, satisfying it); and it misstates Rule 4 as "partially violated" (it is fully satisfied). These factual inaccuracies in rule assessments, including self-contradictory phrasing on Rule 1, represent major deviations, warranting a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria. The justification is overly verbose and speculative where it should be precise, further reducing alignment with the ground truth's clear, tabular structure.
