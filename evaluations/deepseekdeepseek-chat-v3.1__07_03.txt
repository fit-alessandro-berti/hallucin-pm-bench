6.5

ADDED TASKS  
The LLM answer lists all added tasks correctly regarding both id and name.

REMOVED TASKS  
The LLM answer lists the removed task correctly regarding both id and name.

GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES  
The LLM answer correctly lists the change for Gateway_ReviewNeeded but fails to mention the type change for Gateway_Payment, which is present in the ground truth.

FORMAT  
The LLM omits the dash bullet style (“- ”) used in the ground truth and instead lists items without bullets. This is a (minor but clear) formatting error.

STRICTNESS  
Omitting one entire gateway type change (Gateway_Payment), which is a concrete, easily verifiable functional change, is a significant error. The minor formatting differences (lack of bullet points) warrant a further reduction.

Therefore, the combined omissions and formatting differences bring the score to 6.5.
