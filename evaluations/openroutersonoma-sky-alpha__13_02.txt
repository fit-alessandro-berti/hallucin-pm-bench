The LLM answer fully matches the ground truth for questions 1, 2a, and 2b, with exact numeric values and calculations. For question 3, the response adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (68 words), explicitly addresses the single-occurrence issue (low support: 1 event, 1 case), notes instability/variance (underrepresenting role, skewing metrics/models), and cautions against over-generalization (mislead by generalizing from slice, biased insights). No factual errors, inventions, or deviations from the log data.
