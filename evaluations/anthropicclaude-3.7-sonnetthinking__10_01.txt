6.0

**Breakdown of score:**

**Adherence to Vocabulary Policy (Strict):**  
- The LLM answer correctly uses only the allowed terms (“KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”) and does not mention forbidden ones. (No deduction.)

**RACI Allocations:**  
- The answer merges *Responsible* and *Accountable* (RA) in several places, instead of distinguishing them as in the ground truth (e.g., "R / A").
- The answer does not consistently follow the ground truth for role assignments. For example:
  - "Receive Application": Ground truth assigns Account Manager as "R/A", LLM writes "RA" (ambiguous), and also marks Compliance Officer and Finance Clerk as "I", but the LLM uses "I" for both Compliance Officer and Finance Clerk (matches only in part). The LLM omits "C" for Compliance Officer.
  - "KYC Review": Ground truth assigns Compliance Officer as "R", Account Manager as "A", Finance Clerk as "C", IT Support as "I", but LLM puts "RA" for Compliance Officer and "C" for Account Manager, which doesn't precisely match.
  - "Order Vetting": LLM puts "RA" for Account Manager, "C" for Compliance Officer, no involvement for others. Ground truth is "R/A" for Account Manager, "C" for Compliance Officer, "I" for both Finance Clerk and IT Support.
  - Other rows also show mismatches in RACI assignments.

**Formatting / Structure:**  
- LLM uses "RA" (Responsible/Accountable combined) instead of clearly delineating "R" and "A" (as the ground truth does as "R / A"), resulting in significant information loss.
- The RACI legend provided is correct, but the matrix does not apply the rules as per the ground truth, notably not adhering to the "one Responsible" rule (RA is ambiguous).

**No Unwarranted Content:**  
- No extra activities, roles, or columns are added—a positive.

**Summary:**  
The answer has:
- **No terminology breaches** (no direct deduction),
- **Significant deviations in RACI assignments and notation** (major deduction—each instance of incorrect RACI assignment is severe, especially combining R/A throughout rather than specifying as the ground truth does),
- **Format errors** (e.g., ambiguity of "RA"),
- **No extra/unwarranted content** (minor positive).

**Therefore:**  
Strictly graded, this is a 6.0—well below perfect due to multiple mis-assignments and failure to deliver the specific RACI granularity demonstrated in the ground truth, but not lower because the core steps/terms are all correct and forbidden terms are avoided.
