4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Terminology (strong match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exclusively, with proper capitalization and no forbidden terms (e.g., no "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", or "Payment Processing"). This fully adheres to the vocabulary policy.
- **Structure and Format (partial match, +1.0 point)**: The RACI matrix is produced with activities as rows and roles as columns, using a clear table format. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are added (unwarranted content avoided). However, headers include unnecessary abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") not present in the ground truth, and there's no bolding on key cells (e.g., **R / A**, **R**). The added title, legend, and closing note introduce extraneous content not in the ground truth, slightly detracting from strict adherence.
- **RACI Assignments (poor match, -6.0 points for errors)**: This is the core failure, with ~16/24 cells differing from the ground truth (strict counting per cell, including directionality of I/C/A/R). Key issues:
  - Missing or incorrect I/C entries across most activities (e.g., Receive Application: CO as I vs. C, IT as - vs. I; Notify Customer: all others as - vs. I).
  - Misplaced accountability (A): LLM often combines RA on the wrong role (e.g., KYC Review: RA on CO vs. R on CO and A on AM; Payment Clearance: RA on FC vs. R on FC and A on AM).
  - Incomplete consultations/informations (e.g., KYC Review: FC as - vs. C, IT as - vs. I; Record Update: AM as I vs. C, FC as I vs. C).
  - While each activity has exactly one Responsible (matching the rubric), the allocations do not reflect the process narrative's implied accountabilities (e.g., AM as A in multiple steps) or flow-based interactions (e.g., CO consulted in Receive Application).
  Even small per-cell errors (e.g., I vs. C, - vs. I) compound strictly, leading to major loss.
- **Overall Correctness and Self-Awareness (neutral, +0.5 bonus for partial intent)**: The matrix covers all activities from the process without invention. No self-awareness issues apply. However, the LLM's claim of "maintaining clear role assignments" is overstated given the mismatches.
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Per instructions, small errors (e.g., single - vs. I) incur significant deductions; cumulative mismatches justify a low score despite terminology success. A perfect match would be 10.0; this is ~40% aligned on content.
