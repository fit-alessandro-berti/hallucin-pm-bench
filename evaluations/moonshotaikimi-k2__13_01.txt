9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate, nearly matching the ground truth on all specifics:

1. Correctly states 1 occurrence for “Manual_Fraud_Check”.
2. Accurately computes 5.56% (the calculation and rounding are correct).
3. Correctly identifies “A1002” as the only relevant case.
4. Provides two clear and appropriate reasons for sampling unreliability:
   - The first (“small temporal sample”) matches “temporal bias” and “small sample size.”
   - The second (“subset of distinct cases... risking a selection bias...”) aligns with “case-mix bias” or “selection bias.”
   
MINOR DEFICIENCY: The answer does not word-for-word recapitulate the note in the ground truth about how a single extra case would greatly affect the frequency (variance). It also does not explicitly mention “survivorship/truncation bias” as an available alternative, though the reasons it gives are solid and well-connected to the fragmented/biased sampling issues.

Small deductions:
- The LLM states “fragment likely captures only a subset of distinct cases,” which is more slightly speculative than directly cited, though still rooted in the fragment provided.
- The phrase “risking a selection bias if those cases are not representative of the entire month’s population” introduces the possibility of unrepresentativeness, but does so in general terms without reference to risk-based subgroups or omission of cancelled/rejected orders.

However, as per the instructions, even small deviations lower the score, so a 1-point deduction is appropriate. Final: 9.0.
