10.0

The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in structure, content, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt's constraints (e.g., deriving only from the 18 log lines, no inferences beyond the data). 

- Question 1: Exact match (1 occurrence/time).
- Question 2: Exact match, including calculation and rounding.
- Question 3: Exact match (identifies A1002; minor phrasing difference like "only" is absent but implied and non-substantive).
- Question 4: Provides two clear, sampling-related reasons that directly align with two ground truth options (temporal bias via "small slice of a single day"; case-mix/selection bias via "subset of distinct cases... not representative"). No hallucinations or extraneous inferences.

No errors or deviations warrant point deduction under strict evaluation.
