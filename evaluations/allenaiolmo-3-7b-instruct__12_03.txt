**4.2**

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Criteria):
- **Correctness of Answer ("No")**: Matches ground truth (10/10).
- **Justification Accuracy**:
  - Fails to accurately represent **C001**: LLM incorrectly claims "Receive_Order → Pack_Items (with Validate_Payment ... not immediately after)", misreading timestamps (09:12 → 09:15 Validate_Payment → 10:00 Pack_Items). Ground truth correctly identifies as immediate (✅). **Major factual error** (-3.0).
  - **C002**: Correctly identifies Pack_Items intervening (❌) (8/10, phrasing slightly unclear).
  - **C003**: Acknowledges no intervention but hedges poorly ("not immediately after — there is no other activity"); contradicts own partial admission. Ground truth clear ✅ (-1.5).
  - **C004**: Correctly identifies Check_Fraud intervening (❌) (10/10).
- **Comprehensiveness**: Cites all relevant CaseIDs but not systematically (no full case-by-case like ground truth). Misses explicit "2/4 violate" quantification (-1.0).
- **Fidelity to Log/Prompt**: Misinterprets timestamps/sequences, violating "meticulous" reliance on evidence. Phrasing like "not ... even most cases" is imprecise (50% violate, not "most") (-0.8).
- **Structure/Clarity**: Informal bullet examples vs. ground truth's precise table; adequate but inferior (-0.5).

**Total**: High-level match on conclusion but significant errors in evidence citation/accuracy warrant major deduction under "utmost strictness" (small errors = significant loss; these are not small).
