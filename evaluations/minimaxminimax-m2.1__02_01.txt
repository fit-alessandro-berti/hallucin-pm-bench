**8.0**

Q1-Q4 match the ground truth exactly (perfect). Q5 has a significant error: includes "Quality_Check" (which appears as the first event in case C-77), resulting in an incorrect list with an extraneous item (4 instead of 3). Order differences are irrelevant per schema ("unsorted list is fine"), but the factual inaccuracy warrants a strict deduction. Overall: high fidelity with one clear content error.
