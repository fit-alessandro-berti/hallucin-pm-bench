8.5

- The LLM answer provides the correct values for all three questions, but it omits the actual case identifiers (A1: just "3", missing the explicit listing of "C123, C456, C789") and precise formatting ("Pack_Items" and "Cancel_Order" are correct for A2 and A3, but A1 loses detail). 

- According to the instruction for utmost strictness, the omission of the case identifiers, which are explicitly present in the ground truth, is a notable lack of precision, leading to a notable penalty. 

- Content-wise, the answers are correct, but the lack of explicitness in A1 costs 1.5 points under strict marking.

- Therefore, 8.5/10.
