- The LLM answer correctly identifies the number of cases (3) for Q1 but omits the explicit listing of cases (C123, C456, C789) present in the ground truth, representing a minor but notable incompleteness under strict evaluation criteria.
- Q2 is an exact match: "Pack_Items".
- Q3 is an exact match: "Cancel_Order".
- Format is concise bullet points as prompted, but lacks the ground truth's labeling (e.g., **A1:**), which is a small formatting discrepancy. Overall, high accuracy with deductions for omissions.
