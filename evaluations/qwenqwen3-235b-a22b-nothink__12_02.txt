9.5

The LLM correctly answers "No" and cites the relevant counter-examples, referencing both C003 (lines 6-7) and C005 (lines 11-12), as in the ground truth. Its justification is factually correct, concise, and clearly points to the evidence in the log. There are only small differences in phrasing: e.g., the LLM specifically mentions "*Cancel_Order*" in C005, though the core point is that *Receive_Order* never appears for that case. This mention does not introduce inaccuracy, but is a subtle shift in emphasis compared to the ground truth, which only stresses the absence of *Receive_Order* in C005. As per strictness, this small extraneous detail and very slight shift in focus warrants a minor deduction, leading to 9.5.
