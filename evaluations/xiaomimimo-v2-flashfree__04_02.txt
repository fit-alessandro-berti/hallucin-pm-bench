4.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **R1**: Completely incorrect (Violated vs. Compliant; wrong justification confusing R5 with R1). Major error (-2.5 points).
- **R2**: Status correct, but justification factually wrong (Ship_Goods was not "more than 2 days after" any plausible "last approval"; it precedes the post-change approval). Significant error (-1.5 points).
- **R3**: Correct status and justification. Full credit.
- **R4**: Correct status and justification. Full credit.
- **R5**: Correct status; justification accurate but incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice example). Minor deduction (-0.5 points).
- **R6**: Correct status and justification. Full credit.
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT).
- **Format**: Matches prompt structure (list format, ≤20 words), but lacks bolding on statuses as specified (**Compliant**, etc.). Minor deduction (-0.5 points).

Base 10.0, deductions total -5.0 for strict adherence; two rule errors outweigh similarities.
