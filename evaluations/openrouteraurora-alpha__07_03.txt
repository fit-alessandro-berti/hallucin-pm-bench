The LLM answer is semantically perfect, identifying all correct added tasks (3), removed task (1), and gateway changes (2) with exact IDs, names, and type transitions matching v1 to v2 and the prompt's format specification. No extra content, commentary, or unchanged elements mentioned—fully compliant with instructions.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for small formatting differences vs. ground truth:
- Missing bullet prefixes ("- ") on all 6 list items (-0.5).
- Extra blank lines after each heading (-0.2).
- Missing alignment spaces on second gateway line (-0.1).

These are trivial textual variances not mandated by the prompt (which specifies no bullets or alignment), but strict grading against ground truth requires penalization.
