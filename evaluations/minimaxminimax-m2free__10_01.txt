### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Compliance (Partial Credit, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with proper capitalization and bolding where emphasized. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This matches the ground truth and prompt policy exactly.
- **Structure and Format (Low Credit, +1.0 point)**: The table format is present with activities as rows and roles as columns, no extra tasks/roles/columns introduced. However:
  - Column headers use abbreviations (e.g., "Account Manager (AM)") vs. ground truth's full names without abbreviations—minor but strict deduction.
  - Activity names match except for minor bolding inconsistencies (e.g., "Receive Application" not bolded in LLM but plain in ground truth).
  - Combined "A/R" notation used where ground truth separates (e.g., **R / A**) or assigns to distinct roles—formatting deviation.
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, -6.0 points overall, strict penalty for mismatches)**: The core of the evaluation is RACI correctness against ground truth, reflecting the narrative (one Responsible per activity, Accountable to AM where appropriate). The LLM answer has significant deviations in 4/6 rows, violating strict comparison (even small per-row errors deduct heavily):
  - **Receive Application**: CO is "I" (LLM) vs. "C" (GT)—error in consultation.
  - **KYC Review**: AM "C" vs. "A"; CO "A/R" vs. "R"; FC "I" vs. "C"—multiple errors; combines A/R incorrectly when GT assigns A to AM and R to CO separately.
  - **Order Vetting**: Matches closely (minor "A/R" vs. "R / A" formatting).
  - **Payment Clearance**: AM "C" vs. "A"; CO "I" vs. "C"; FC "A/R" vs. "R"—multiple errors; incorrect A assignment to FC.
  - **Record Update**: FC "I" vs. "C"; IT "A/R" vs. "R"—errors in consultation and combined A/R.
  - **Notify Customer**: Matches closely (minor formatting).
  - Each activity should have exactly one Responsible per narrative/ground truth; LLM adheres to "one R" but misassigns roles/Accountables, failing narrative reflection.
- **Unwarranted Content (Penalty, -1.0 point)**: Includes title ("RACI Matrix – Order-to-Cash (FinCo)"), legend, and note on terminology—extra elements not in ground truth, violating "no unwarranted content" (even if helpful, strict rubric disallows).
- **Overall Strictness**: With 4/6 rows having errors (some multi-faceted), plus formatting/extras, this is a substantial deviation despite terminology success. Small errors (e.g., per-role mismatch) compound to major loss; score reflects ~50% alignment but penalized heavily for inaccuracies.
