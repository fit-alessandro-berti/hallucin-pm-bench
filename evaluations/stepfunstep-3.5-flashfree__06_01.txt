**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (full credit)**: Correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines; Create_Documentation — Quality_Check). Correct alphabetical ordering within each pair (C<Q, P<S) and across the list (C before P). Ignores Process A entirely. Uses correct task names and em dash "—".
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - Adds unrequested introductory sentence (~20% penalty: violates "Output one pair per line" instruction).
  - Uses numbered list ("1. ", "2. ") instead of plain lines (~20% penalty: format violation).
  - Lacks column alignment (e.g., no padding spaces like "Procure_Materials     —"; first pair missing extra spaces after "Documentation") (~10% penalty: small formatting error, but strict deduction).
  - Missing rationale/explanation section present in ground truth (~10% penalty: reduces fidelity to provided ground truth).
  - Minor spacing inconsistencies around dashes (single vs. multiple spaces) (~5% penalty).
- **Overall**: Content accuracy 100%, but format/output structure deviations are multiple and non-trivial, warranting deductions under "utmost strictness" and "small errors reflect in significant loss." Exact match would be 10.0; this is strong but flawed.
