6.7

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Correct (identifies 3 distinct cases, matching ground truth). Full credit.
- **Question 2**: Correct (identifies "Pack_Items" as the immediate predecessor for C456's Ship_Order). Minor formatting difference (no escape in underscores) but substantively accurate. Full credit.
- **Question 3**: Incorrect (claims "Create_Order", which appears 3 times; ground truth is "Cancel_Order", which appears exactly once). Complete mismatch, major error under strict criteriaâ€”significant deduction.
- **Overall**: Two of three answers accurate (66.7% alignment), but strict policy demands heavy penalty for the substantive error in Q3, preventing a higher score. Response format is concise and bullet-pointed as requested, which avoids further deduction.
