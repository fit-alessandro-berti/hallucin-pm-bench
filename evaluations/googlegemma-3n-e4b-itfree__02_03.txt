3.5

- The answer is in bullet-point format, as requested.
- Question 1 is correctly answered as "3", matching the ground truth.
- Question 2 is answered correctly as "Pack_Items", matching the ground truth.
- Question 3 is incorrectly answered as "Create_Order" instead of the required "Cancel_Order". This is a major error, as Q3 requires careful counting of all concept:names in the fragment.

Given that two of three questions are correct, but the third answer is entirely wrong, the grade must be significantly penalized per your criteria. Additionally, the answer for Q1 is just the number "3", instead of enumerating the actual case identifiers as in the ground truth, which should also slightly reduce the score per your "utmost strictness." Thus, a score of 3.5 is fair, reflecting correct bullet-point format and correctness for Q1 and Q2, but serious failure for Q3 and minor incompleteness for Q1.
