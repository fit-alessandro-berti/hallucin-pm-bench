The LLM answer fails catastrophically against the ground truth and prompt requirements. It repeatedly violates the strict vocabulary mandate by using "Payment Clerk" (forbidden; must be "Transaction Analyst") in rows 1, 2, 5, and indirectly in informed/consulted cells, and "compliance officer" in row 8 (must be "Regulatory Liaison"). It introduces non-mandated and inaccurate extra tasks (rows 6-8: splits "ensure SWIFT message is sent" into a separate row and fabricates a notification task with wrong responsible party, exceeding the source text's 6 steps without faithful mapping). Role assignments are incorrect (e.g., row 3 assigns "KYC Review" to Transaction Analyst as Responsible, but source and ground truth map it to Regulatory Liaison; approvals wrongly consulted/informed). The table structure inverts the standard RACI format (roles in cells instead of letters under role columns), adds extraneous title/subtitle ("as practiced in the clearing and settlement area"), and omits the legend while fabricating consultations/informations not in the source. No faithful coverage of tasks without omissions, additions, or substitutions—total deviation from ground truth's exact mapping, mandated wording, and clean 6-task structure.
