**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Factual error. "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **exactly once** (case 1002, 09:07:13Z). LLM incorrectly claims 2 (likely confuses with "Manual Review"). -5.0 points.
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Vague, speculative (e.g., assumes full log has "numerous manual reviews"—violates "no speculation"). Misses key ground truth points: tiny sample size (14 events/3 cases/<2h), sampling error (0-7% swing), wide CI, rare-event volatility, near-synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). Word count OK (≤120), but superficial. -4.0 points.
- **Overall**: Strict deduction for errors; partial credit for format/attempt at reasoning.
