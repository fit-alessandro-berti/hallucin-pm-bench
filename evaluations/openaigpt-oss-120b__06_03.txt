The LLM answer correctly identifies the two concurrent task sets in the exact order and with the precise task names, aligning with the ground truth's core content. However, it incurs deductions for formatting and stylistic differences: use of an unnecessary bold title, bullet-point lists instead of inline notation with backticks and the ‖ symbol, subheadings phrased as "Parallel Split #1:" rather than "Set 1 – first parallel block:", and omission of the explicit statement "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." These deviations from the ground truth's concise and specific presentation warrant a significant but not total loss of points under strict evaluation criteria.
