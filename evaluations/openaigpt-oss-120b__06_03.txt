9.5

The LLM answer precisely identifies both sets of concurrently executable tasks in Process B and numbers them in process order, matching the ground truth exactly in substance. Task names, parallel structure, and order are all correct.

Differences:
- The LLM uses slightly different headings (“**Parallel Split #1:**”) and formatting, while the ground truth explicitly labels as “Set 1,” “Set 2,” and gives symbolic notation (`‖`), and includes an extra clarifying statement (“No other tasks... parallel”).
- The LLM omits this clarifying final sentence, but as it gave no information about any further parallelism, that is a very minor omission—still, the more explicit statement in the ground truth arguably helps remove potential ambiguity.

Thus, due to the small differences in phrasing and explicitness, but perfect technical correctness, the score is 9.5.
