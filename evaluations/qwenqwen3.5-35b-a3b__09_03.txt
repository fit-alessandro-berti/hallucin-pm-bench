The LLM answer is highly accurate and precise, correctly identifying the impossibility due to absent data in Artefact A (no rows or timestamps), explicitly linking to start_time/complete_time for cycle time computation, and covering all metrics (average cycle time, std dev via variance reference, 95% CI). It adheres to "one short paragraph," plain text, no guessing. Minor deductions for slight verbosity (extra detail on Artefact B's irrelevance, though factually correct and helpful for precision; "current audit" phrasing), longer length vs. ground truth's conciseness, and "variance" instead of direct "standard deviation" (though equivalent). No factual errors, but strict diff in wording/structure prevents perfect score.
