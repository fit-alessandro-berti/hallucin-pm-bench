**2.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Vocabulary (mandated terms)**: Perfect match (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance used exactly; no forbidden terms). +2.0 points.
- **Structure & Content Completeness**: Correct rows/activities (no extras). RACI format present, one Responsible per row. However, column headers abbreviated (AM/CO/FC/IT vs. full "Account Manager" etc.) – unwarranted deviation. IT cell blank in Row 1 (not "I"). -1.5 points.
- **RACI Allocations**: Major differences vs. ground truth (core failure criterion). Exact cell mismatches:
  | Activity | Mismatches (LLM vs. GT) |
  |----------|--------------------------|
  | Receive Application | CO: I vs. C; IT: blank vs. I (2/4 wrong) |
  | KYC Review | AM: C vs. A; CO: R/A vs. R; FC: I vs. C (3/4 wrong) |
  | Order Vetting | None (perfect) |
  | Payment Clearance | AM: I vs. A; CO: I vs. C; FC: R/A vs. R (3/4 wrong) |
  | Record Update | AM: I vs. C; FC: I vs. C; IT: R/A vs. R (3/4 wrong) |
  | Notify Customer | None (perfect) |
  - ~12/24 cells differ (50% error rate). R/A vs. R or A not equivalent; ignores GT's distributed A/C. Does not "reflect narrative" as precisely as GT (e.g., GT assigns C/A beyond primary handler). Significant loss: -4.0 points.
- **Formatting**: No bolds (**R / A**, **KYC Review**, etc.), inconsistent spacing (R/A vs. **R / A**), misaligned table. Small but strict deductions: -1.0 point.
- **Overall**: Terms/structure save it from 1.0, but RACI/formatting errors dominate (high difference count). Unintuitive GT RACI followed strictly for grading.
