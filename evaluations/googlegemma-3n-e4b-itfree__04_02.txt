### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer matches the ground truth on R1, R4, R6 statuses and overall result (both NON-COMPLIANT). However, it has critical errors: 
- R3 status incorrectly marked Compliant (should be Violated; Pay_Invoice on 06-Mar precedes Receive_Goods on 07-Mar, and justification is factually wrong).
- R5 status incorrectly marked Compliant (should be Violated; Ship_Goods and Pay_Invoice occurred before new Manager_Approval post-Change_Request, violating "before any further processing step").
- R2 status correct but justification flawed (ignores reset of approval timeline due to Change_Request; cites wrong trigger for 2-day violation, using original Finance_Approval instead of final post-change approval on 07-Mar).

These are major compliance misassessments (two rules wrongly cleared), leading to under-detection of violations despite correct overall (strict deduction for errors in core analysis). Format is mostly adherent, but content accuracy is poor.
