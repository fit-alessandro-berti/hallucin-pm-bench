4.0

Rationale for scoring:

- R1: Correct (Compliant, correct justification).
- R2: Correctly marked Violated, but justification is inaccurate. The LLM says Ship_Goods occurred 3 days after Finance approval, but ignores that the required approval is the new Manager_Approval after the change. This is a conceptual error and misses the true reason for violation.
- R3: Incorrect. LLM says Compliant, but Pay_Invoice occurs before Receive_Goods (Pay_Invoice 06-Mar, Receive_Goods 07-Mar) which is a direct violation.
- R4: Correct (Not Applicable, correct justification).
- R5: Incorrect. Marked Compliant, but actually violatedâ€”Pay_Invoice and Ship_Goods occur before the new Manager_Approval after Change_Request.
- R6: Correct.

Justification quality: 
- Justifications for R2, R3, and R5 show incomplete/incorrect analysis.
- Only 3/6 rules are fully correct; two are clear errors (R3, R5). R2 is only half-correct due to a misleading explanation.

Formatting and conciseness are adequate, and the overall conclusion is correct, but fundamental reasoning errors drastically reduce the score. 

Therefore, strict evaluation yields a 4.0.
