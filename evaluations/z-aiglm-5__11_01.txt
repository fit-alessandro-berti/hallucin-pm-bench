The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top 3 activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes both metrics verbatim from the table (minor formatting diffs like "95p" vs "p95", "h" attachment, and ".0" retention are negligible), includes no extraneous content, and stays under 150 words (~110). Memo format with header enhances executive crispness.

Actions are concrete, logically tied to waiting bottlenecks (e.g., automation for queuing), and project ≥20% cuts (collective statement covers "per activity" intent). Highly relevant without unsupported inventions.

Deductions (-1.0 total): Actions differ substantively from ground truth (alternative implementations, no per-action % or invented "pilots"/estimates); extra intro/closing/header not in ground truth; lacks exact phrasing/punctuation (e.g., emdash). Strict on these mismatches despite fulfilling prompt perfectly.
