10.0

**Evaluation:**

- **A1:** Correct ("3"). Matches exactly with ground truth.
- **A2:** Exact sequence is given: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order". This matches the expected answer.
- **A3:** Both required activities are present ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") and in correct (alphabetical) order. Slight formatting difference (lack of underscores) is acceptable unless the prompt specified strict formatting, which it did not.

No extra, missing, or fabricated information is present. All factual elements are correct.

**Final score:** 10.0
