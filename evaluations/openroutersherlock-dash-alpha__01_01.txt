### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiency, ~60% point loss)**: The ground truth identifies three explicit decision points (eligibility validation in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility, amount threshold post-Finance_Controller_PreApprove, and final approval/rejection at Finance_Controller_PreApprove/Senior_Auditor_Review). The LLM answer only covers the amount threshold (similar to GT #2) and omits the other two entirely, despite the process description implying validation ("checks the claim against") and success requirements ("has succeeded"). This is a critical incompleteness for "every decision point," warranting severe deduction. Structure is simplistic (single bullet) vs. GT's comprehensive table, further reducing clarity and completeness.
  
- **Required Documents (Minor Strengths, ~10% point loss)**: Lists all seven documents accurately, matching the GT catalogue, including the conditional note on *AuditTrail*. However, omits GT's explicit clarification that it's "part of the catalogue" despite conditionality and the parenthetical note reinforcing no introductions of extras/legacy items. This is a small but noticeable gap in precision under strict scrutiny.

- **Overall Compliance and Style (Additional ~20% loss)**: Adheres to the "Do not introduce" rule (no extras added), but the response is overly concise and lacks the structured, exhaustive summary expected. No hallucinations, but failure to infer all implied decisions from the process/constraints (e.g., rejection paths) shows insufficient expertise on the described process. Total reflects partial coverage of core requirements with strict penalties for omissions.
