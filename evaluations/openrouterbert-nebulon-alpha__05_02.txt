The LLM answer proposes an invalid modification (changing `targetRef` of `Flow_2` to a non-adjacent task, breaking process reachability, dangling flows, and violating BPMN validity without true "reversing direction"), completely differs from the ground truth's precise `dueDate` attribute change on `Task_CollectEquipment`, fails to address SLA correctly, and mismatches both diff content and rationale entirely.
