9.0

- Q1: Correct (no loss of points).
- Q2: Correct sequence and format (no loss of points).
- Q3: The activities are correct and in the correct order, but the answer omits the underscores (e.g., "Arrange_Delivery" vs. "Arrange_Delivery"); the LLM answer uses "Arrange_Delivery", which is correct, so no issue here. The LLM answer uses the correct underscores.

Upon careful comparison, the LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in both factual content and format: proper case names, underscores present, correct sequence and order, correct separator and bullet list for Q3.

Therefore:  
No errors detected. The answer deserves a 10.0.

Correction: The prompt says "also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points". Since the LLM puts Q3 as a vertical list but not as a markdown list, while the **ground truth** answer uses a markdown bullet list format, if strictness applied to this presentation, there could be a -0.5 point deduction for not using markdown bullets. However, since the prompt says "one per line", the LLM's approach is acceptable.

Adjusted score: 10.0

(If being strictly formal about markdown bullet, subtract 0.5.)
