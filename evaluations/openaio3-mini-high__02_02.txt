The LLM answer is factually precise across all questions, with no deviations, omissions, additions, or formatting errors relative to the ground truth content and prompt requirements. Q1 matches exactly in substance (explicit listing of cases is accurate and non-conflicting). Q2 reproduces the exact sequence with correct activity names (underscores intact) and separator. Q3 lists the two distinct predecessors alphabetically, one per line, without extras or misordering.
