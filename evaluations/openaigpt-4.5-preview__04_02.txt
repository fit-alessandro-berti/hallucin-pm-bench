The LLM answer has a critical error in R2 (incorrectly marked Compliant instead of Violated, failing to recognize the new Manager_Approval as the final approval post-Change_Request, which invalidates the timing analysis). R5 justification is incomplete (omits Pay_Invoice as a prohibited step). Other rules match status but have minor justification variances; overall result correct but undermined by per-rule inaccuracies. Strict evaluation penalizes substantive analytical flaws heavily.
