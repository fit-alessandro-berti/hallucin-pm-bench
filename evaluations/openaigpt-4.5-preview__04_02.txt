R1: Correct.  
R2: Incorrect — LLM missed that, after the Change_Request, the “last required approval” becomes the new (second) Manager_Approval (2025-03-07), and Ship_Goods took place before this, not after, exceeding 2 days from that last approval. LLM incorrectly used Finance_Approval as the reference point ([GROUND TRUTH]: Violated, [LLM]: Compliant).  
R3: Correct.  
R4: Correct.  
R5: Justification is correct, but LLM omits that Pay_Invoice (not just Ship_Goods) also violated the reapproval rule; still, it marks as Violated, which aligns with ground truth, so only a small deduction.  
R6: Correct.

The overall result and most reasoning are sound, but the significant R2 error and incomplete R5 justification (though the status is correct) should lose substantial points.

**Strict deduction applied for the major R2 misjudgment and incomplete R5 justification despite correct status.**
