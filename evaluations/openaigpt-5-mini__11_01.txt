The LLM answer fully matches the required activities, rankings, and verbatim waiting-time quotes (including precise decimals from the table). It stays under 150 words, omits all prohibited content, and provides concrete, relevant actions logically tied to waiting times, each promising ≥20% reduction via data-driven methods (e.g., A/B testing) without unsupported inventions. Minor deductions for slight phrasing variances from ground truth (e.g., "95th =" vs. "p95"; more detailed but equivalently valid actions; added title) and "worst → best" wording, which is semantically accurate but not identical.
