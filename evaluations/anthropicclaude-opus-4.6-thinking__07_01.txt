The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip` and `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway change: `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive), using exact names and IDs from the XML, with no extras or speculation. Deductions for: non-identical heading format (### vs **, missing •); inconsistent list styling/markers (- vs *); minor phrasing variances in task ID presentation (`id` vs `(id = `id`)`); gateway entry reorders name/id and alters phrasing (→ vs "to (v1/v2)"); absent closing note. Semantically perfect, but textual/format diffs prevent 10.
