### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in overall accuracy and fidelity to the process description, with no hallucinations (e.g., no invented KYC/AML elements) and correct identification of decision points and most documents. However, under utmost strictness, the following differences from the ground truth warrant deductions:

- **Part (a)**: Minor phrasing variances reduce perfection slightly. The LLM correctly summarizes both decision points in one sentence each and captures the rules accurately (e.g., "Low or Medium" risk AND ≤ €250,000 skip, and "at least two approvals" for TriVote). However, the ground truth uses more concise, process-oriented naming ("Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check" and "“TriVote” approval gate") without step references, and specifies "record 'Approve'" for TriVote—LLM's addition of "any two approvals suffice to pass" echoes the rule but introduces slight redundancy not in the ground truth. The explicit "otherwise, proceed to step 5" is precise but less elegantly phrased as "otherwise it proceeds to that review" in ground truth. These are small stylistic/structural differences, but per instructions, they reflect a 0.5-point loss from a potential 10.

- **Part (b)**: This is the primary weakness, causing a significant deduction (2.0 points total). The list is mostly correct in order and completeness for 8 of 9 items, accurately sequencing first appearances (e.g., scorecards in Step 3, Deck Memo in 5). However, it omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document (first appearing in Step 8, separate from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in Step 7), resulting in only 8 items instead of 9. The ground truth explicitly treats the signed version as required and separate, making this an substantive error in completeness. Adding step references is extra but not incorrect, though it deviates from the ground truth's clean list format—another minor deduction (0.5 points).

No other errors (e.g., order is perfect, no extras), so the score balances high fidelity against these gaps. A perfect match would require exact phrasing, structure, and full document inclusion.
