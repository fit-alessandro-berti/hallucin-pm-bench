7.0

**Rationale:**

**a) Decision points**
- The LLM answer precisely identifies both decision points and accurately summarizes them with nearly identical wording to the ground truth.  
- There is *very* minor imprecision in step 6: the phrase "the loan passes only if at least two of three roles approve" is clear and complete; "any two approvals suffice to pass" matches the process description and ground truth.
- The summary for the conditional branch (step 4) is also accurate and concise.
- No significant omissions or errors in this section.

**b) Required documents (order of appearance)**
- The LLM correctly lists:
  1. Form 14B  
  2. Scorecard–Cyan  
  3. Scorecard–Magenta  
  4. Scorecard–Yellow  
  5. Deck Memo  
  6. Offer Sheet 77  
  7. ID Matrix Declaration  
  8. Loan Dossier 2025

- **Critical Miss:** The LLM omits **"Signed Offer Sheet 77"** from the list; the ground truth explicitly includes this as a required document upon Request-Applicant-Confirmation.
- This is a substantial error: "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is a distinct required document; omitting it signals insufficient attention to specific document requirements as per the ground truth.
- The rest of the listed documents and their order are otherwise correct.

**Conclusion:**  
The LLM answer is **substantially** correct in logic and sequencing, except for the omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77," which is a serious but singular mistake.  
There are no hallucinated documents or steps, and no other factual errors.  
Per strict grading instructions, this omission results in a **significant loss of points, yielding 7.0/10.**
