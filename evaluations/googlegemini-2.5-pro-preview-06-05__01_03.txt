**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM answer includes the two main decision points:  
  1. The conditional underwriting (risk-based skip)  
  2. The TriVote approval gate  

- However, it *improperly adds* a third decision point (“Applicant Confirmation”), which is not a true process gate per the process description but rather a procedural/consent step. This is a significant error, demonstrating a misunderstanding of what constitutes a decision point versus a procedural requirement.

- The LLM’s phrasing is less precise than the ground truth (e.g., “Conditional Underwriting” is not the process step name, and rules are not always given as one-clear-sentence logic statements). The LLM also fails to be explicit that the skip/bypass happens *after* risk rating and that the alternative is Manual-Underwriting-Review.

**b) Documents**

- The LLM omits several required documents explicitly present in the ground truth:
  - It misses the three distinct scorecards (Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow).
  - It omits “Signed Offer Sheet 77,” which is explicitly distinct from “Offer Sheet 77” in the process.
- It lists “Deck Memo,” “Offer Sheet 77,” “ID Matrix Declaration,” and "Loan Dossier 2025" correctly (albeit “Deck Memo” only appears conditionally).
- It does not list the documents *in the exact full order of first appearance* as in the process.

**Other observations**

- The LLM answer follows instructions about hallucinations, not introducing any extraneous documents (e.g., no KYC/AML/credit-bureau mention).
- There are no major factual hallucinations, but important omissions and a minor but strictly instructed mischaracterization of a process gate.

**Scoring rationale**

- Large penalty for omitting three required documents and one distinct step/document (scorecards, signed offer sheet).
- Penalty for adding a non-existent decision gate.
- Partial credit retained for correct inclusion of most real decision points and some documents.
- Minor penalties for lack of precise one-sentence logic and naming mismatches.

**Final score:**  
**5.2/10.0**
