**8.0**

The LLM answer is factually perfect across all three questions, correctly identifies the 3 cases (minor wording diffs like "distinct" and "and" are negligible), accurately names "Pack_Items" as preceding "Ship_Order" for C456, and correctly identifies "Cancel_Order" as appearing once. Bullet-point format matches the prompt. However, strict deduction for lack of exact ground truth format (no "**A1:**"/"**A2:**"/"**A3:**" labels, no backslash escape in "Pack\_Items"), extra unnecessary explanatory text in Q2/Q3 violating "concise ... only", and minor Q1 phrasing variance (-2.0 total).
