**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect and fails all criteria:
- Q1: Claims 0 occurrences (actual: 1 in C05, explicitly marked).
- Q2a/b: No percentages computed (ignores 48 events/12 cases; correct: 2.08%, 8.33%).
- Q3: Wrong premise (zero vs. single occurrence); generic text lacks required elements (single-occurrence issue, variance/instability, over-generalisation caution); exceeds intent without data fidelity.
Complete deviation from ground truth; no partial credit under strict evaluation.
