The LLM answer is nearly perfect: questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the ground truth exactly in values and calculations. For question 3, it adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (92 words), addresses the single-occurrence issue (explicitly notes "a single occurrence"), highlights variance/instability (e.g., "insufficient statistical evidence," underweighting in models), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "inaccurate process maps and unreliable predictions," unrepresentative sample). Minor deduction for slightly broader phrasing (e.g., emphasizing "triggers" and "outcomes" over ground truth's statistical noise specifics), but it fully covers required elements without invention or errors.
