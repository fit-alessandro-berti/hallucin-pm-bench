**9.0**

The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, with perfect correctness on Q1 (exact count of 1, matching ground truth detail). For Q2, it stays under 120 words (~105), identifies core issues (tiny sample, naming inconsistency with data examples), and structures clearly. Minor deductions for: (1) lacking ground truth's precise statistical insight (e.g., 14 events, 0%-7% swing, confidence intervals, rare-event sampling error); (2) mild speculation ("likely contains... e.g., 'Fraud Check (Manual)'" not directly evidenced, vs. ground truth's data-tied near-synonyms); (3) slightly less quantitative rigor on sample volatility. Still excellent fidelity to data and prompt, no major errors.
