The LLM answer incorrectly concludes "No" for Question 1, missing the alternative path via T2-T7-T4 that fills P5 without firing T3, while preserving the P2 token for T5. This is a fundamental error in analyzing reachable markings and dependencies, invalidating the entire response. No correct sequence is provided, and the explanation misstates prerequisites (e.g., claiming T3 is required for P5). Even minor attempts at structure fail to compensate for the core inaccuracy.
