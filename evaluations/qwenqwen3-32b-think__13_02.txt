The LLM answer is nearly perfect: questions 1 and 2 (a/b) match the ground truth exactly in content, calculations, and formatting (deterministic and precise). For question 3, the response is concise (under 100 words), grounded in the log, and addresses the required elementsâ€”single occurrence (explicitly noted), variance/instability (via underrepresentation and small samples hindering reliability), and caution against over-generalization (direct mention). Minor deduction for not emphasizing statistical noise/skewing or confidence intervals as in the sample, shifting focus slightly to predictive/training and automation implications, which, while valid, diverges from the ground truth's core statistical framing.
