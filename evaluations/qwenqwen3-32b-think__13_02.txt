**9.0**

- Question 1: Correct ("1 time").
- Question 2a: Correct ("2.08%").
- Question 2b: Correct ("8.33%").
- Question 3: The explanation correctly mentions that the activity occurs in only one case, links this to limitations in analytics and predictions (variance, exclusion from metrics, "small samples hinder accurate generalization," etc.), and satisfactorily covers (i), (ii), and (iii) from the rubric. There’s a minor lack of explicit labeling about variance/instability—language like "underrepresented" and "small samples" implies but does not precisely state issues of variance or confidence intervals. However, it is still technically sufficient.

- Minor deduction (−1.0) for not directly mentioning the term “variance” or “instability,” as in the ground truth, and not being as explicit about the statistical unreliability.

All calculations and logic are correct otherwise, so the answer is highly accurate and complete.
