**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Failures, ~60% weight)**: Ground truth identifies **exactly 3 precise decision points** (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) with correct branching logic, positions in flow, and terminology. LLM incorrectly expands to **7 items**, fabricating unsubstantiated "halts/stops/blocks" (e.g., KYC failure "stops", CIA "negative halts", NFC "blocks") not in the process description. Includes non-decisions (KYC, CIA, NFC, Disburse Funds). Buries correct 3 amid extras. Significant invention of failure modes violates "exact terminology and flow"; loses ~7 points.
- **Required Documents (~40% weight)**: Near-match (all 6 listed correctly), but minor phrasing deviations from process (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" → "≤ 3 months old" ok, but GTA shortens further; "CIS template" → "CIS"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" → shortened). No disclaimer note. Minor deductions (~0.5 points).
- **Overall Structure/Formatting**: LLM uses bold headers, numbered/bullets inconsistently with GTA's "####" and numbered lists. Introduces unrequested details (e.g., "branch after...", but wrong branches). Strictness demands zero extras/inventions: total score reflects ~70% mismatch on core content.
