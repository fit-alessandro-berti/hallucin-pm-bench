9.0

### Evaluation Notes:
- **Strengths**: All rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) match the ground truth exactly. Justifications are concise (all â‰¤20 words) and factually accurate in identifying key violations. Overall result is correct (NON-COMPLIANT).
- **Weaknesses (deductions applied strictly)**: 
  - R2 justification imprecisely blends R5's Change_Request requirement into R2's core timing rule ("within 2 days after last approval"), focusing on pre-approval occurrence without explicitly addressing the post-approval timing delta (e.g., no mention of dates or ">2 days" as in ground truth). This is a small but notable interpretive error (-0.5).
  - Format includes unnecessary markdown headers (# and ##) not specified in the prompt, deviating slightly from the required simple per-rule structure (e.g., ground truth uses a clean table for clarity, though not mandated) (-0.5).
- No other errors in R1, R3, R4, R5, or R6. Overall high fidelity, but strictness penalizes imprecision and extras.
