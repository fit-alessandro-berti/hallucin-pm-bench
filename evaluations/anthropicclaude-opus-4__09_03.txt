The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth: both correctly identify the absence of event data and timestamps in Artefact A as the core reason for impossibility, emphasizing that no calculations (average, std dev, CI) are feasible without raw times for "Approve Invoice." The explanation is precise, concise, and avoids guessing, fully addressing task 3 in a short paragraph format. Minor deductions for slight elaboration on cycle time formula and Artefact B (which, while correct and relevant for completeness, adds non-essential detail not present in the ground truth's more streamlined phrasing) and the use of bold formatting (mild deviation from "plain text," though not a table). No factual errors or omissions that undermine the response.
