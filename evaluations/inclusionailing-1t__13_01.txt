9.8

### Evaluation Breakdown
This evaluation is based on a strict, line-by-line comparison to the ground truth, penalizing even minor deviations in wording, completeness, or extraneous details. Total score reflects near-perfect alignment (content is accurate and derived solely from the log), with a tiny deduction for slight phrasing inconsistencies and unnecessary additions (e.g., approximations or extra explanations) that deviate from the concise ideal format.

1. **Exact count of “Manual_Fraud_Check”**: LLM says "1 time"; ground truth expects "1 occurrence". Minor wording difference (0.1 point loss). Fully accurate.

2. **Percentage**: LLM provides "5.56%" with correct calculation and total events count. Matches ground truth exactly in value and math, but the "≈" symbol is an unnecessary approximation (exact is 5.555...%, but rounded correctly); extra "Total events = 18" is helpful but not in ground truth format (0.1 point loss). Otherwise perfect.

3. **Case identifiers**: LLM lists "A1002", which is correct. Ground truth adds phrasing like "Only case **A1002** contains “Manual_Fraud_Check”" for emphasis. LLM is concise but omits the full explanatory sentence, missing a touch of completeness (no major loss, as the identifier is the core).

4. **Two sampling-related reasons**: LLM provides two valid reasons: (1) single-day coverage (aligns with "Temporal bias" in ground truth), (2) small sample size (4 cases, 18 events; directly matches ground truth example). Phrasing is clear and sampling-focused, with no hallucinations. Minor deduction (0.0 total here) as it exactly covers "any two" from the provided options without deviation.
