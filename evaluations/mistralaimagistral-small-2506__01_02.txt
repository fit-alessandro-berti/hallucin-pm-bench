7.0

The LLM answer is fairly accurate but contains two notable issues that warrant significant point deductions given the instructions for strict grading:

**Strengths:**
- The answer uses all the exact activity names from the process and does not introduce standard loan terminology.
- Both the decision points and required documents are clearly and correctly listed overall.
- The answer captures the logic (≤ 2 for scores, < or ≥ €15,000 for Amount Threshold Decision).

**Errors/Omissions:**
1. **Missed Decision Point:**  
   - The answer omits the third formal decision point:**Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**, described in the ground truth as "the board votes Approve or Reject."  
   - This is a significant omission because it is an explicit decision step depicted separately in the ground truth answer and in the process, not just a subcondition of the Amount Threshold Decision.

2. **Wording/Detail Issues:**  
   - In the Required Documents section, the answer does not note the specific formats (“single pay-stub or tax slip”) as concisely as the ground truth, but this is minor.
   - The answer does not explicitly clarify “complete list” or reiterate the exclusion of standard documents (though not strictly necessary, the ground truth does this).

**Conclusion:**
- **Major point loss** is for omitting “Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)” as an explicit, standalone decision point.
- Minor point loss for slightly looser wording on document details.

**Strict scoring justification:** Even small omissions are to be reflected in significant point loss. The omission of a primary decision node is **not** a small error.

**Final score:** 7.0 (missing one out of three key decision points; otherwise, well formatted and accurate).
