### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Partial Match, Major Omission – 5/10)**: The LLM correctly identifies and describes the first two decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate and Amount Threshold Decision) using the exact activity names and core logic from the prompt, with minor phrasing differences (e.g., "proceed" vs. "continue"; "> 2 points" vs. exact "differ by ≤ 2"). However, it strictly omits the third decision point (Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)), where the board explicitly votes "approve" or "reject" – a key branch in the process flow. The ground truth includes this as a distinct decision point, and its absence represents a significant incompleteness in summarizing *all* decision points. Additionally, the LLM lacks contextual flow details (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" or "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which the ground truth provides for clarity and accuracy.
  
- **Required Documents (Strong Match, Minor Phrasing Issues – 8/10)**: The list is complete and uses exact terminology from the prompt (e.g., "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)", "Community Impact Statement (CIS) template"). Phrasing is nearly identical, but small discrepancies include "≤ 3 months old" (matches prompt exactly) vs. ground truth's abbreviated "≤ 3 months"; and "single pay-stub or tax slip" (matches prompt) vs. ground truth's shortened "pay-stub/tax slip". The LLM omits the ground truth's explanatory note ("*(No credit bureau report...)*"), which reinforces the non-standard process but isn't explicitly required by the prompt – still, it adds value to the completeness.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity (7/10)**: The response follows the prompt's structure (summarizing decision points then listing documents) without introducing forbidden standard loan terminology. Formatting is clear but deviates slightly from ground truth (e.g., bolding and numbering style). No major additions or inventions, but the omission of one decision point and lack of flow context prevent a higher score. Under strict evaluation, these gaps (especially the missing decision point) warrant a deduction, as they alter the comprehensiveness of the summary.
