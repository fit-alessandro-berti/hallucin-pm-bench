3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Alignment on Core Identification (Positive, but limited):** The LLM correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as the worst-performing based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth. This earns partial credit (+2.0 points base).
- **Quantification Errors (Major Deduction):** The task requires precise quantification of SLA excesses. The LLM incorrectly invents "total time" by adding throughput + waiting (e.g., Legal: 1500s exceeding 600s by 900s; actual throughput excess is +300s per ground truth). Similar errors for Risk (+780s vs. +300s) and Credit (+260s vs. +60s). This core mismatch, fabricating metrics not in the data, deducts -4.0 points for inaccuracy and violation of "ground in data" rule.
- **Recommendations (Partial Match, Significant Differences):** All three recommendations are present and data-driven (tied to waiting times/cases), but content and specificity diverge entirely from ground truth (e.g., LLM suggests resource allocation/triage/investigation; ground truth proposes pre-checks/analyst addition/heuristic). LLM embeds them as sub-bullets under activities, violating "bullet points only for recommendations" (ground truth uses a separate bulleted section). Deduction of -2.5 points for differences and structural non-compliance.
- **Structure and Format (Minor Issues, but Strict Penalty):** Memo headers differ (LLM adds date and formal subject; ground truth is simpler). Intro text mismatches (LLM's "1175 cases or more" is imprecise vs. ground truth's case total). No ending projection in LLM (present in ground truth). Word count ~180 (close to ~150). Deduction of -1.0 point for format deviations.
- **Overall Strictness:** Even with correct activity selection, pervasive errors in quantification (central to prompt), recommendation content, and structure justify a low score. No inventions beyond basics, but failures in fidelity to ground truth amplify deductions.
