The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and reasoning, providing a concise single-sentence explanation of why the average cycle time cannot be determined due to the absence of timestamps and durations (with only event counts available). The minor phrasing variations (e.g., "Cannot determine" vs. "It is impossible"; explicit mention of "start/complete events" and "per-trace durations" vs. "event counts" and "start-to-completion intervals") do not introduce any errors, inaccuracies, or deviations from the required response format or intent.
