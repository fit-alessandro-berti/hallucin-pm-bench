8.0

- The LLM answer is largely accurate and well structured.
- **R1**: Correct (Compliant), justification matches the ground truth.
- **R2**: Marked as Violated (correct), but the LLM says “shipped before new mandatory Manager re-approval” as the reason. The real violation is that Ship_Goods was not within two days after the last required approval (which was 7-Mar), so the justification only partially captures the rule—it is not the “mandatory re-approval,” but the time window after the last approval. **-1**
- **R3**: Correct (Violated), with clear date references.
- **R4**: Correct (Not Applicable), matches.
- **R5**: Correct (Violated), justification is clear (events after Change_Request occurred before new approval).
- **R6**: Correct (Compliant), matches.
- **Overall**: Correct, matches.

Main loss of points is for R2: the LLM suggests that the violation is due to “shipped before new mandatory Manager re-approval” rather than “not shipped within 2 days after the last required approval,” which, though related, is not the precise reason based on the rule. Otherwise, the answer is concise and complete. For utmost strictness, this misidentification requires a reduction.

**Final Strict Score: 8.0**
