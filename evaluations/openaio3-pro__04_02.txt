8.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Statuses**: All rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) match the ground truth exactly (6/6 correct), which is the core requirement.
- **Justifications**: Generally concise and under 20 words, with accurate reasoning for R1, R3, R4, and R6 (minor wording differences but no factual errors). However:
  - R2: Justification correctly identifies the sequencing issue tied to expedited timing but omits explicit reference to dates or the "2 days" threshold, differing from ground truth's precise timing detail—small deduction for lack of specificity.
  - R5: Justification is incomplete; it mentions only Ship_Goods as a violating step but omits Pay_Invoice (and implicitly Receive_Goods) as further processing steps before new approval, per the trace and ground truth—significant deduction for this omission under strict criteria.
- **Overall Result**: Matches exactly (NON-COMPLIANT).
- **Format**: Follows prompt closely (rule-by-rule with status and justification, all-caps conclusion), though lacks ground truth's table structure (not required by prompt).
- **Strictness Adjustment**: Perfect status alignment merits high base score, but justification gaps (especially R5 incompleteness and R2 imprecision) warrant a 2.0-point deduction for fidelity to ground truth details. No other errors (e.g., word limits, chronology, or rule interpretation).
