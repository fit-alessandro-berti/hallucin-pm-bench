7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and accurately assesses each rule: Rule 1 satisfied (QE once and before RA), Rule 2 satisfied (VP after both QE and RA given high severity), Rule 3 violated (NA before RA), and Rule 4 satisfied (CC after NA and VP). This matches the ground truth substance. However, significant deductions for excessive verbosity and rambling (far from the prompt's "short justification"), disorganized structure (prose with internal monologues instead of a clean table or bullets throughout), and minor errors/typos (e.g., "QA" for QE, "eaten satisfied," "RP states" for ruleset). These flaws reduce clarity and adherence to the prompt's format, warranting a strict penalty despite core accuracy.
