### Evaluation Rationale
- **Question 1**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence). Full points.
- **Question 2a/2b**: Exact match to ground truth calculations and formatting (2.08%, 8.33%). Full points.
- **Question 3**: Covers single-occurrence issue (explicitly notes "only one case") and cautions against over-generalisation (risks "inaccurate" analyses and "misleading" optimisations). However, it only weakly implies variance/instability (via "dominated by... auto-check path," but lacks explicit discussion of noise, skewing, or confidence intervals as required). Critically, it contains a factual inaccuracy: generalising from this low-support slice (1/12 cases) would risk *under*estimating prevalence/impact of Manual_Fraud_Check if the full log shows higher frequency, not "overestimating" as stated—this misdirection undermines the explanation's validity. Word count (85) is compliant, but content flaws warrant ~40% deduction for this section.
- **Overall**: Strong on quantitative accuracy (70% of evaluation weight), but qualitative error in (3) significantly impacts under strict criteria. No extraneous information invented; adheres to log-only rule.
