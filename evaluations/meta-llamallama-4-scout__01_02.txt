8.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate in identifying and describing the core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing all required documents without introducing extraneous terminology. However, under strict evaluation, it incurs point deductions for the following differences from the ground truth:

- **Decision points context and phrasing**: Omits precise positioning (e.g., "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split" and "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"), which provides essential flow summary; uses lowercase/unbolded "approve" or "reject" instead of bolded/capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**"; lacks arrow notation (⇒) for branches. These are small but meaningful omissions/alterations in summarization detail (-1.0 point).
- **Required documents wording**: Minor but exact mismatches include "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months" (#2); "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip" (#3, extra "single" and "or" vs. "/"); "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)" (#4, extra "template"). These are small phrasing errors (-0.5 point total).
- **Missing note**: Ground truth includes an explanatory note on absent standard documents, reinforcing the non-standard process; LLM omits this (-0.5 point).

The response adheres closely to the prompt's terminology and structure but falls short of ground truth precision, warranting these deductions from a potential 10.0.
