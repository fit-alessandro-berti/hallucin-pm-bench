3.0

**Justification:**  
The LLM answer shows reasonable effort to use the mandated terms, but significant errors and omissions require a very strict penalty according to your grading instructions:

1. **Misses a Role**: The LLM omits the "Operations Manager" role present in the GROUND TRUTH—this is a serious failure in completeness and strict vocabulary compliance.
2. **Task Naming**: While most activities use (or attempt to use) correct terminology, activities such as "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case closure" do NOT appear in the source text or Ground Truth—adding extraneous steps not requested.
3. **Consulted/Accountable Assignments**: Incorrect RACI role assignments for several steps, e.g. "Release the payment" makes Regulatory Liaison consulted (should be just Transaction Analyst and Operations Manager), and "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent" is not a distinct Ground Truth activity.
4. **Extraneous Activities**: The last two rows ("Archive the case file" and "Notify Regulatory Liaison...") are inaccurate/over-split: the notification is not required, and "Case file" vs "Record" is a minor but cumulative deviation.
5. **Formatting and Table Structure**: The Ground Truth groups under strict activity names—several LLM step descriptions diverge unnecessarily, e.g. "Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary" vs concise "**KYC Review**".
6. **RACI Role Mapping**: LLM uses "A/R" (Accountable/Responsible) combined, which is not in the Ground Truth and is ambiguous; in a strict evaluation, this is a notable error.
7. **Missed "Regulatory Liaison" Consistency**: Uses the correct mandated term, but sometimes in extraneous places or not as primary in the task flow.

**In summary:**  
The LLM answer does not maintain full fidelity to required vocabulary, drops a role, splits/merges steps incorrectly, invents non-existent steps, and muddles RACI assignments. All these warrant a severe reduction in score under your "utmost strictness" requirements.
