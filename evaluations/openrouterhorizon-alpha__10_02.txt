### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and fidelity to the prompt's mandates, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

- **Role Columns**: The LLM uses 3 roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), while the ground truth uses 4 (adding Operations Manager, which is unmandated and introduces extraneous elements). This structural mismatch alone deducts points, as the prompt emphasizes using *only* mandated terms (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison) plus necessary ones from the text (IT Support)—no additions like Operations Manager.

- **Tasks and Coverage**: The LLM expands to 8 tasks, inventing an 8th ("Notify Regulatory Liaison of case closure") by splitting the original step 6, which the ground truth condenses into 6 tasks without a separate notification row. Task wording in the LLM retains informal phrasing (e.g., "Receive customer’s transfer instruction and log it in the system") instead of the ground truth's mandated, concise versions (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction"). This violates the "mandated wording" requirement and adds unsubstantiated content.

- **RACI Assignments**: Assignments differ in nearly every row, showing poor alignment with the source text and ground truth:
  - Receiving: LLM (R-TA, A-RL, I-IT) vs. Ground (R-TA, I-RL, A-OM, C-IT)—wrong accountable (RL vs. OM) and consulted/informed roles.
  - Screening: Partial match (R-TA, A-RL) but IT as I vs. C.
  - KYC Review: LLM (C-TA, A-RL, I-IT) vs. Ground (C-TA, R-RL, A-OM, I-IT)—RL role (A vs. R) and extra OM.
  - Approval: LLM (C-TA, A/R-RL, I-IT) vs. Ground (C-TA, R-RL, A-OM, I-IT)—inaccurate dual A/R and missing OM.
  - Release: LLM (R-TA, A-RL, C-IT) vs. Ground (R-TA, I-RL, A-OM, C-IT)—wrong RL (A vs. I).
  - SWIFT Sending: LLM treats as separate task (C-TA, I-RL, A/R-IT) vs. Ground's implied integration in Release; mismatched assignments.
  - Archiving: LLM (I-TA, I-RL, A/R-IT) vs. Ground (C-TA, I-RL, A-OM, R-IT)—wrong IT (A/R vs. R), missing OM, and TA (I vs. C).
  - Notification: Entirely extra in LLM, absent in ground truth.

- **Vocabulary and Formatting**: Partial compliance with mandates (e.g., "KYC Review" used once correctly, roles like Transaction Analyst and Regulatory Liaison applied). However, inconsistencies like "A/R" notation (not in ground truth), verbose task descriptions, and an added title/legend that doesn't match the ground truth's simpler format reduce fidelity. Bold emphasis and exact phrasing (e.g., "**KYC Review**") are missing or inconsistent.

- **Overall Fidelity to Prompt/Source**: The LLM covers the informal description but introduces errors/expansions (e.g., assuming IT accountable for notification), failing to "map every step... without omissions or substitutions." Small errors (e.g., unmandated task splitting, imprecise wording) compound into major deviations, justifying severe point loss. A perfect score would require near-identical structure, assignments, and wording; this is a rough approximation at best.
