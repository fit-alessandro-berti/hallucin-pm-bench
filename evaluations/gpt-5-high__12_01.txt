10.0

The LLM answer is fully accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt by providing a clear "No" verdict with evidence-based justification citing case IDs and activity sequences. It correctly identifies the reversed ordering in Cases 1001 and 1003, notes the absence in Case 1002 (disproving "always"), and emphasizes the "immediate predecessor" aspect to counter the claim precisely. No factual errors, omissions, or deviations from the ground truth's core content; minor stylistic differences (e.g., no line citations, but activities are cited instead) do not detract from fidelity to the data or prompt requirements.
