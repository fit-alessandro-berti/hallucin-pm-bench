8.0

The LLM answer correctly judges the fact as inaccurate and provides evidence for each relevant case. Specifically:

- It notes that in Case 1001 and 1003, Update_Inventory is not immediately preceded by Authorize_Refund, correctly mapping the event order.
- In Case 1002, it observes the absence of Update_Inventory, which indeed disproves an "always" claim.

However, the LLM answer has two shortcomings compared to the ground truth:
1. The LLM's justification is less explicit about the *directionality* (that Update_Inventory is actually before Authorize_Refund, i.e., the claimed order is not only absent but *reversed*).
2. It lacks a succinct final sentence stating that in none of the cases does Authorize_Refund immediately precede Update_Inventory, making it less clear-cut and focused than the ground truth.

Additionally, the ground truth makes explicit reference to the relevant line numbers for clarity and provides more detail per case.

These omissions and lower explicitness warrant a deduction of 2 full points for strictness, resulting in a score of 8.0.
