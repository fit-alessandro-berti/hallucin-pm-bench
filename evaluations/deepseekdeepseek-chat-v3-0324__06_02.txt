The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in terms of content and formatting of the sets (all tasks in each parallel block are included, in correct groupings, no extraneous content or errors regarding Process A or C, and sequential tasks are omitted). Any minimal extra commentary ("Each line represents...") is not prohibited by the prompt and does not detract from correctness, as the explicit instruction was about enumerating the sets per numbered line, which is followed exactly.
