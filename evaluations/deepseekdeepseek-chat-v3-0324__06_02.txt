The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists all three concurrent task sets from Process B with exact task names and order, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it deviates by adding an unrequested introductory sentence, bold formatting on tasks and process name (altering presentation), and an explanatory paragraph at the end, which violates the prompt's strict instruction to "Return your answer as numbered lines" without extras. Under utmost strictness, these additions represent minor but clear formatting and content bloat, warranting a deduction from a perfect score.
