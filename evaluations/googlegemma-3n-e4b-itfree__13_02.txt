2.5

1. The answer to question 1 (**1**) is correct.

2. The answer to 2a is **incorrect and very substantially so**: The LLM wrote "8.33%" (1/12), but the correct computation is 1/48 (since there are 48 events), which equals **2.08%**. The LLM’s answer is off by a factor of four, which is a major numerical error.

3. The answer to 2b is correct: "8.33%" (1/12).

4. The explanation for (3) is decent: it addresses the rare event, warns about over-generalization, and describes how such rare activity might mislead analyses. However, it’s less precise than the ground-truth and omits explicit mention that statistics (e.g., means) based on a single data point are extremely unstable; it only generally mentions "not reflect typical..." and "overemphasize". It does not mention volatility, confidence, or the dangers for statistics like cycle time as explicitly as required by the rubric. It is a "generic" warning rather than the highly specific one in the ground-truth.

**Main errors:**
- Severe and precise error for 2a (quantitative).
- (3) is a bit too generic and misses “variance/instability” and specific risks to metrics/statistics.

**Scoring:**   
- One of three numeric items is significantly wrong. The freeform item is only partially correct.
- Given strict grading (as per instruction), this merits a low score.

**Score:** 2.5
