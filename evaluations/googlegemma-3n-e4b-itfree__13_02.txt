4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1**: Correct (1 occurrence). Full accuracy here.
- **Question 2a**: Major error. Incorrectly calculates as 8.33% using 12 events instead of 48 total events (actual: 1/48 â‰ˆ 2.08%). This is a fundamental misreading of the log's event count, leading to a wholly inaccurate percentage. Severe deduction.
- **Question 2b**: Correct (8.33%, 1/12 cases). Matches ground truth.
- **Question 3**: Partially aligns but misses key ground truth elements like single-occurrence vulnerability to noise, instability in statistics (e.g., cycle time, probabilities), and wide confidence intervals. The response is generic about "skewing models" and overemphasis but lacks the required depth on variance and over-generalization risks from one data point. Moderate deduction for incomplete coverage.

Overall, the critical error in 2a (a deterministic numeric) dominates, warranting a low score despite partial successes elsewhere. Strict evaluation penalizes factual inaccuracies heavily.
