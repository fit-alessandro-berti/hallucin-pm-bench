4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
This evaluation strictly compares the LLM answer to the ground truth, penalizing all differences in structure, content, roles, tasks, RACI assignments, and adherence to implied formatting. Even minor variances (e.g., phrasing, omissions, additions) result in significant deductions, as per instructions. Starting from 10.0 and deducting proportionally:

- **Roles (Columns) [-3.0]**: LLM includes only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support (3 roles), matching the prompt's mandated terms and informal description. Ground truth adds an unmentioned "Operations Manager" (now 4 roles), which LLM omits entirely. This is a major structural mismatch, as all ground truth assignments (especially A's) rely on this role. No credit for "correctly" avoiding an undefined role—fidelity to ground truth is paramount.

- **Tasks (Rows and Wording) [-2.0]**: LLM covers 7 tasks, mapping closely to the informal description (e.g., separates "Log transfer instruction" from receiving, adds "Send SWIFT message" to cover step 5 explicitly, uses "Conduct KYC Review" with bolding mandated term). Ground truth has 6 tasks with different phrasings (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" combines steps 1; omits "Send SWIFT message"; "Archive Record" vs. "Archive case file"; "KYC Review" is shorter and lacks "Conduct...on sender and beneficiary"). This introduces extras/omissions and wording variances (5/6 tasks differ), violating "map every step without omissions or substitutions" noted in ground truth. Small phrasing errors (e.g., "flagged transaction" vs. "High-Risk Transactions") compound deductions.

- **RACI Assignments [-2.0]**: Nearly every cell differs due to missing role and varying interpretations. Examples:
  - Screening: LLM (R Analyst, C Liaison) vs. GT (R Analyst, A Liaison, I Operations, C IT)—mismatches on Liaison (C vs. A), adds extra uninvolved cells.
  - KYC Review: LLM (C Analyst, R Liaison) vs. GT (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Operations, I IT)—missing A and I.
  - Approve: LLM (I Analyst, R Liaison) vs. GT (C Analyst, R Liaison, A Operations, I IT)—Analyst I vs. C; missing extras.
  - Release: Similar but missing A Operations.
  - Archive: LLM (— Analyst, I Liaison, R IT) vs. GT (C Analyst, I Liaison, A Operations, R IT)—Analyst — vs. C; missing A.
  LLM also hides A's (when =R) per its legend, while GT explicitly shows all A's— a formatting deviation.

- **Structure and Formatting [-0.5]**: LLM adds a title (# header) and verbose legend (explains A hiding, includes uninvolved "—"), not in ground truth. Ground truth uses a detailed header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), simpler legend, and boldens only "**KYC Review**" without extras like "Conduct...". Markdown table is present but not identical (e.g., bolding on tasks/roles in both, but inconsistent).

- **Vocabulary and Overall Fidelity [-0.5]**: LLM strictly uses mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") with no forbidden ones (e.g., no "CDD" or "Compliance Officer"). Ground truth does the same but notes it explicitly. Minor plus, but outweighed by above. Covers "every task" per prompt but diverges from ground truth's mapping.

**Total Deduction**: -8.0 → **Final Score: 4.0**. The LLM answer is a reasonable but flawed attempt at the prompt (uses mandated vocab, covers informal steps), but it fails to match ground truth's roles, tasks, and assignments closely enough under strict criteria—resulting in a low-mid score rather than failing entirely (no complete invention of content or violation of core rules).
