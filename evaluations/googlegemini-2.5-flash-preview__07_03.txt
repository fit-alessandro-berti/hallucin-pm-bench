Reasoning:
- The LLM answer contains accurate content and identifies all changes, but it does not precisely follow the required format. 
- The headings are out of order: "REMOVED TASKS" is first instead of "ADDED TASKS", contrary to explicit instructions.
- The task and gateway differences are listed without dashes (the ground truth uses "- " before each item).
- The required parentheses for task names are present, but the lack of dashes is a formatting error.
- Gateway changes omit the dash and indentation seen in the ground truth.
- The content itself is correct, but the prompt required "verbatim" adherence to headings and order, which was not followed.
- All these formatting issues together represent significant loss of points per strict evaluation criteria.
