### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the process but deviates significantly from the ground truth in both sections, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria. Key differences include:

#### Decision Points
- **Major Errors (Heavy Point Deduction)**: The ground truth strictly limits decision points to three true branching gates (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, and Final Micro-loan Board Approval), focusing on conditions that alter the flow. The LLM incorrectly expands this to seven items, treating non-branching assessments (e.g., Quick KYC Verification, Community Impact Assessment, Dual Underwriter Split, Neighbourhood Feedback Check) as "decision points." This introduces extraneous content not present in the ground truth or prompt, violating the instruction to summarize only the actual decision points using exact terminology. Even the correct ones (e.g., Underwriter Alignment Gate) have slight rephrasing (e.g., "> 2 points" vs. exact "differ by ≤ 2"; "send to" vs. "proceed to"), which counts as small errors per the strictness guideline.
- **Minor Issues**: The structure uses numbered lists and bolding, but the content inflates the summary beyond the ground truth's concise, targeted format.

#### Required Documents
- **Moderate Errors (Point Deduction)**: The list includes all six required items with exact names (e.g., "Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)"), which is accurate. However, the LLM adds interpretive phrases not in the ground truth or prompt (e.g., "dated within the last 3 months" vs. concise "≤ 3 months"; "either a single pay-stub or a tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "using the provided template"; "includes scores from both underwriters"; "documenting at least 3 local references"). These are small but unnecessary expansions, leading to significant point loss as instructed. The ground truth's closing note on excluded documents is omitted, further reducing fidelity.
- **Positive Aspect (Minimal Credit)**: No introduction of standard loan terminology, and the list is complete.

Overall, the answer is over-elaborated and misidentifies core elements, resulting in only partial alignment (about 40% fidelity). A higher score would require near-exact matching of the ground truth's brevity and precision.
