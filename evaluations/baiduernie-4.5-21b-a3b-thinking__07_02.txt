### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially captures the structure and some correct elements but introduces significant errors by failing to ignore cosmetic renamings (e.g., treating the name change from "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan" as a removal and addition of separate tasks, which inflates both lists incorrectly). This violates the prompt's explicit instruction to ignore renamings. The added tasks list includes 1 extraneous item (out of 4 total), removed tasks includes 1 extraneous item (out of 2 total), and the gateway change mixes in ignored name details ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check") while omitting precise terminology like XOR/OR. Ground truth is concise and accurate, with no such confusions. Under strict evaluation, these core misinterpretations warrant a substantial deduction from a perfect score, despite partial accuracy in identifying new elements like "Verify Identity" and the gateway type shift.
