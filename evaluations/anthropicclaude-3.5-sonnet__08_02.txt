7.0

**Evaluation:**
- **Correctness:** The LLM’s answer is correct in both the direct answer (“Yes”) and in providing a plausible firing sequence showing T5 before T3. The transition sequence and the step-by-step marking changes are essentially correct.
- **Clarity:** The explanation is generally clear.
- **Conciseness:** Slightly wordy, but not excessive.
- **Fidelity to prompt constraints:** The answer keeps within the 120-word limit.

**Point deductions:**
- **Missing marking annotations:** The ground truth specifies stepwise markings after each transition. The LLM only describes states in prose, omitting explicit marking notation (e.g., M₁ = {P1, P2}). This is a significant gap, as markings are crucial in Petri net analysis.
- **Less precise about disabling T3:** The ground truth mentions explicitly that after T5 fires, T3 is disabled, which is an important subtlety about the net’s behavior and was omitted.
- **Sequence clarity:** The LLM doesn't number the firing steps nor does it state the final marking after T5.
- **Small imprecision:** The LLM’s phrase “T3 is on a parallel path but isn't required for T5's firing conditions” is a bit vague and misses the point that T3 is actually *disabled* once T5 fires.

For these reasons, the answer is nearly correct but loses 3 points for lack of marking clarity, insufficient discussion of T3’s disabled state, and less rigor than the ground truth demands.
