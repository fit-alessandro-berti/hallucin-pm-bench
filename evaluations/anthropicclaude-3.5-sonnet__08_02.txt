The LLM answer correctly identifies "Yes" for Q1 and provides the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) as the ground truth for Q2, with a step-by-step explanation that accurately traces markings implicitly and confirms T5 fires before T3. It stays under 120 words and notes T3's parallel irrelevance for T5, which aligns with the concept. Minor deductions for lacking explicit markings (e.g., M₁ = {P1, P2}), not mentioning T5's consumption of P2 disabling T3 afterward (a confirmatory detail in ground truth), and slightly informal formatting (e.g., "Answer 1" vs. "**Q1**"), but no factual errors.
