The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in multiple critical areas, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:  
- **Table structure and format**: LLM uses a task-first format with R/A/C/I as separate columns and names entries explicitly, while ground truth uses roles as columns, tasks as rows, abbreviated R/A/C/I entries with bolding for key elements (e.g., **R**, **KYC Review**), and includes a legend. This is a fundamental mismatch.  
- **Roles included**: LLM limits to Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support (no Operations Manager), violating the implied distribution in ground truth, which introduces and assigns Operations Manager as Accountable for most tasks.  
- **Task coverage and naming**: LLM splits and covers 8 tasks (e.g., separate "Log Transfer Instruction," "Ensure SWIFT Message is Sent," "Notify Regulatory Liaison"), exceeding and differing from ground truth's 6 consolidated tasks (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" instead of logging, "Archive Record" omitting SWIFT and notification, no detail on sender/beneficiary for KYC). This results in omissions relative to ground truth (e.g., no equivalent to Operations Manager's role) and extraneous entries.  
- **RACI assignments**: Completely divergent; LLM often assigns the same role as both Responsible and Accountable with empty Consulted/Informed (except one), while ground truth distributes across roles with specific I/C for Transaction Analyst/Regulatory Liaison/IT Support and Accountable to Operations Manager (e.g., Transaction Analyst is R only for receive/screen/release, C elsewhere).  
- **Additional elements**: LLM lacks the ground truth's header ("Task / Activity (mandated wording)"), bolding, legend, and post-table explanatory note on vocabulary adherence/mapping.  
- **Vocabulary adherence relative to ground truth**: While LLM correctly uses mandated terms (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst), it does not match ground truth's exact phrasing/integration (e.g., no bold **KYC Review** or mandated wording annotation). Minor naming variances (e.g., "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record") compound differences.  

Every aspect shows substantial divergence, with no core alignment beyond basic Markdown and mandated term usage, justifying maximal point loss.
