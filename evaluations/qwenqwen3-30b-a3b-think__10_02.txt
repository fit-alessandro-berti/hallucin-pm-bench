The LLM answer demonstrates some understanding of the enforced vocabulary but falls short in several critical aspects, meriting a strict deduction per the instructions:

**Major Issues:**
- **Omission of "Operations Manager":** The ground truth includes an "Operations Manager" role that is central to the RACI (as most Accountable), but the LLM answer omits it entirely. This is a significant deviation.
- **Missing Consulted/Informed assignments:** The LLM answer is extremely sparse—most entries for C/I are empty, failing to reflect the comprehensive stakeholder roles of the ground truth.
- **Task Vocabulary Drift:** While most activities are close to the correct wording, terms like "Log Transfer Instruction," "Screen Payment Against Sanctions List," and "Notify Regulatory Liaison" deviate from the ground truth’s mandated activity language (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction," "Screen Against Sanctions List," etc.) and don’t always strictly follow the vocabulary mandate.
- **Excess Step:** The inclusion of "Notify Regulatory Liaison" as a task is not present as a standalone step in the ground truth and seems to artificially inflate the process.

**Minor Issues:**
- **No Legend:** The ground truth provides a legend and clear role-activity assignments; the LLM answer omits this, slightly impeding clarity.

**Partial Correctness:**
+ Correctly uses "KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," and "Transaction Analyst" (when those roles/terms appear).
+ Assigns R/A with some alignment to the described tasks.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer lacks strict adherence to the ground truth in role assignment, comprehensive mapping of C/I roles, and some aspects of enforced task vocabulary, causing substantial loss of marks as per required strictness. This warrants a significant reduction, but not a failing mark, as basic terminology is not universally incorrect and the structure is present.

**Score:** 4.0
