**8.0**

The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in core requirements: correctly identifies the same three worst activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based jointly on SLA breaches (+300s, +300s, +60s) and high waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s), quantifies overruns precisely, uses bullet points exclusively for the three recommendations, and delivers a concise executive memo (~135 words) grounded primarily in table data without extraneous metrics or activities.

Minor deductions (-2.0 total) for:
- Missing formal memo header (To/From/Subject: -1.0).
- Slightly different activity order (Risk Review before Legal Approval, despite tie in breach but Legal's superior wait/throughput: -0.5).
- Minor inventions ("delays cascade, inflating overall cycle times, eroding customer experience": -0.5), though less severe than ground truth's 4805 cases and 35% projection.

Recommendations differ in content but fulfill "one concrete, data-driven action each" equivalently (tied to high wait/throughput per activity). Overall high fidelity despite small structural/phrasing variances.
