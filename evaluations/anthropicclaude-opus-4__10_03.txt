4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer partially adheres to the prompt's vocabulary policy by correctly using the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms or leaks. However, it fails in several critical ways against the ground truth, warranting a low score under strict evaluation:

- **Activity Coverage and Naming (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: The prompt specifies "do not rename, merge, or add activities," but the LLM adds an unauthorized "Notification" row (absent in ground truth) and renames additional activities ("Approval (high-risk cases)" vs. ground truth's "Compliance Officer Approval"; "Payment Release" vs. "Release Funds"). This violates the instruction to cover *every activity* without additions or renames, introducing extraneous content while missing precise phrasing.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**: Significant mismatches across rows:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Analyst is "-" (no involvement) vs. ground truth "C" (consulted).
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office Analyst "I" vs. "–"; Compliance Officer "-" vs. "C"; Treasury Ops "-" vs. "I".
  - **AML Screening**: Compliance Officer "-" vs. "C"; Treasury Ops "-" vs. "I".
  - **Risk Scoring**: Entirely incorrect—LLM assigns "R, A" solely to Compliance Analyst with all others "-", but ground truth distributes as Front-Office Analyst "C", Compliance Analyst "R" (not "A"), Compliance Officer "A", Treasury Ops "I". This is a core process inaccuracy.
  - **Approval**: Minor naming issue aside, assignments match closely (Front-Office Analyst "I", Compliance Analyst "C", Compliance Officer "R, A", Treasury Ops "-"), but Treasury Ops uses "-" vs. ground truth "–".
  - **Payment Release**: Front-Office Analyst "C" vs. "I"; Compliance Analyst "-" vs. "C"; Compliance Officer "-" vs. "C".
  - **Notification**: Unauthorized addition with no ground truth equivalent; assignments (e.g., Front-Office Analyst "A", Treasury Ops "R") are speculative and incorrect.

- **Formatting and Presentation (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**: Uses plain "-" instead of ground truth's em dash "–" for no involvement. Lacks bolding on activity names and key RACI cells (e.g., **R, A**). Table structure is Markdown-compliant but not identical.

These errors compound to show incomplete fidelity to the process narrative's roles and activities, with the Risk Scoring row alone being a substantial deviation. No credit for correct vocabulary use offsets the pervasive inaccuracies in RACI logic and additions. A perfect match would score 10.0; this is roughly 45% aligned.
