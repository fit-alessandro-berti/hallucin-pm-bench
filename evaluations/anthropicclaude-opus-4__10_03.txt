5.0

- **Vocabulary:** The LLM answer strictly adheres to the vocabulary policy—only “Intake Vetting”, “KYC Review”, “AML Screening”, and “Risk Scoring” are used, and prohibited synonyms do NOT appear. Full points on this aspect.
- **Activity Names:** “Approval (high-risk cases)”, “Payment Release”, and “Notification” are used as activity names, whereas ground truth requires “Compliance Officer Approval” and “Release Funds”; “Notification” is *not* a required activity. This violates the instruction “do not rename, merge, or add activities”, and is a significant error.
- **Roles/Responsibility Assignments:** Many RACI assignments differ from ground truth:
    - **Intake Vetting:** Marked as I for “Treasury Ops” and does not show C for Compliance Analyst.
    - **KYC Review:** No consultation of Compliance Officer or information to Treasury Ops.
    - **AML Screening:** Same issue.
    - **Risk Scoring:** Fails to make Compliance Officer Accountable (A), and marks Compliance Analyst as both R, A (should only be R).
    - **Approval (high-risk cases):** Merged with “Compliance Officer Approval”, but labels C for Compliance Analyst (correct), but leaves out I for Front-Office Analyst. Also, splitting high-risk/otherwise is not allowed as per instructions.
    - **Release Funds:** Called “Payment Release”, fails to mark all correct C/I assignments.
    - **Notification:** Added activity—NOT present in prompt or ground truth—should not have been included.
- **Table Structure:** Did not maintain exact column/activity names as specified by ground truth (Crucial strictness point).
- **Completeness:** There is an extra row (“Notification”) and an inexact match for other activities.
- **Other Issues:** No use of em-dash (–) for “no involvement”, instead uses “-”. Small point off.

**Conclusion:**  
The submission is free from prohibited vocabulary and most role names are correct, but there are serious structural errors: unauthorized activity names (renaming/adding activities), mismatched/omitted RACI assignments, and incomplete fidelity to the process narrative. These are significant failures under a “utmost strictness” rubric, warranting removal of half or more of the available points. The most egregious flaw is in activity naming and alignment, followed by multiple smaller assignment errors. Thus: **5.0**.
