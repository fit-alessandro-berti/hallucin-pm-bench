The LLM answer is generally correct and identifies the violation of the claimed FACT in both C002 and C004, with accurate references to activity sequences for those cases. Its answer section is concise ("No"), which is correct.

**Areas of Strength:**  
- Correct final verdict ("No").
- Explicitly cites C002 and C004 as counterexamples.
- Quotes the relevant activity sequences and explicitly identifies the non-immediate occurrence in these cases.

**Areas for Point Deduction:**  
- **Misses C003**: The LLM’s justification omits C003 entirely, whereas the ground truth considers each case and confirms immediate succession for both C001 and C003. Full, meticulous process-mining analysis should include positive as well as negative examples.
- **No tabular or systematic per-case format**: The ground truth uses a tabular layout that presents all cases and explicitly confirms for each whether the condition is met or not. The LLM answer fails to provide a complete per-case breakdown, which is crucial to full transparency and rigor in this analytic context.

Because of these omissions—especially failure to mention C003 at all—2 points are deducted.
