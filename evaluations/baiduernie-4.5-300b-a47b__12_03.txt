### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer correctly answers "No" and provides a valid justification by identifying the key counterexamples (C002 and C004) with accurate sequence citations, directly disproving the "always" claim. This aligns well with the ground truth's core logic. However, under utmost strictness:
- **Omission (significant deduction)**: The LLM fails to address C003, where "Validate_Payment" *does* follow immediately after "Receive_Order" (a supporting case). The ground truth exhaustively covers *all* cases (C001–C004) in a case-by-case analysis, which is more meticulous and complete for verifying an "always" rule against the full log evidence. This omission reduces thoroughness, warranting a -1.0 deduction.
- **Minor differences (smaller deductions)**: 
  - Format is less structured (simple list vs. ground truth's table), making it slightly less clear for quick reference (-0.5).
  - C001 citation is accurate but phrased casually ("but this is not universal" instead of explicit ✅/notes), and it doesn't quantify "two out of four" violations (-0.5).
No factual errors in sequences or timestamps; the justification relies only on log evidence. Overall, 90% alignment in content and accuracy, but strict criteria penalize incompleteness.
