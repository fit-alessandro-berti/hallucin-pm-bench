The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the prompt's constraints. All facts derive directly from the log (1 occurrence in A1002, 1/18 â‰ˆ 5.56%). Question 4 provides two valid sampling-related reasons (small sample size and temporal bias) that align precisely with the ground truth's suggested options, stated clearly without inference or hallucination. Minor formatting differences (e.g., "%" spacing) are negligible and do not warrant deduction under strict evaluation.
