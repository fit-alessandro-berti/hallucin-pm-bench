The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists **all** required changes with perfect accuracy—no additions, removals, or gateway changes missed or hallucinated. Content matches ground truth 100% (3 added tasks, 1 removed task, 1 gateway change from exclusive to inclusive). It adheres strictly to the 3 headings, ignores renamings/flows/XML order as instructed.

Minor deductions (-0.5 total) for stylistic differences from ground truth:
- Item format: ID-first with ("name") vs. name-first with (`ID`).
- Bullets vs. numbered lists.
- Gateway phrasing: "Exclusive Gateway (v1)" vs. "exclusive (XOR) in *v1*" (omits acronyms, minor capitalization/wording variance; still factually precise to XML).
- Intro/heading markdown and lack of final note (cosmetic, but strict comparison notes divergence).

Semantically and functionally perfect; differences are presentational only.
