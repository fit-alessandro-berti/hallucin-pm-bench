**4.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment):
- **Decision Points (major failures, ~60% weight)**: Ground truth strictly identifies **exactly 3 decision points** (branching gates): Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA). LLM incorrectly lists **6 points**, fabricating 3 non-decisions (Quick KYC Verification, Community Impact Assessment, Neighbourhood Feedback Check) as "decision points" with invented details (e.g., CIA "determines eligibility based on community benefit" – absent in prompt/GT; KYC/NFC "proceeds only after/before advancing" – not branching decisions). Omits precise positioning ("branch after Dual Underwriter Split", "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"). Phrasing mismatches (e.g., "system triggers auto-approval" vs. "system auto-approves"; extra bolding/embellishments). This is a fundamental misinterpretation – severe deduction (2.0/10 for this section).
- **Required Documents (minor issues, ~40% weight)**: List is complete and accurate (all 6 items match). Phrasing near-identical to prompt, but deviates from GT (e.g., "≤ 3 months old" vs. "≤ 3 months"; "single pay-stub or tax slip" vs. "pay-stub/tax slip"; "(CIS) template" vs. "(CIS)"; bullets vs. numbering; missing "(complete list)" header and explanatory note). No introduction of extras – small errors, but strictness requires deduction (7.0/10 for this section).
- **Overall**: Weighted average reflects core mismatch on decision points (primary prompt focus). Structure/headers differ (GT uses "####"; LLM uses "**"). No standard terminology introduced. Total differences too extensive for higher score.
