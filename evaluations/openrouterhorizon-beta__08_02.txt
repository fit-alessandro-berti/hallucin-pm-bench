3.5

The LLM answer incorrectly states "No" for Question 1, directly contradicting the ground truth's "Yes," which is a critical error requiring significant deduction. While Question 2 provides the correct minimal firing sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4, T5) matching the ground truth and demonstrates understanding via the self-correction, the initial "Impossible" claim and contradictory structure introduce confusion and inconsistency. This halves the score despite the accurate sequence, as strict evaluation penalizes major factual misalignment in the primary response. Minor issues like unclear phrasing further reduce points, but the core insight partially salvages it from a lower rating.
