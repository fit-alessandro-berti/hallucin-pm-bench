**9.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1 (perfect match)**: Exact count "1" stated clearly. +2.5/2.5
- **Q2 (minor deduction)**: Correct final value "5.56%" and total events "18". However, parenthetical "(0.55 rounded to two decimal places)" is a clear error (1/18 ≈ 0.0556 or 5.56%; "0.55" misstates the proportion/percentage). Small but factual inaccuracy → significant deduction. +2.0/2.5
- **Q3 (perfect match)**: Correctly identifies sole case "A1002" (singular phrasing fine given one case; matches "identifier(s)" intent). +2.5/2.5
- **Q4 (strong but not exemplary)**: Provides exactly two valid sampling reasons directly tied to log (small sample/limited cases ≈ "small sample size"; short daytime window ≈ "temporal bias"). Themes align precisely with ground truth examples, no hallucinations/inferences beyond log (e.g., "few cases" derives from 4 cases/18 events; "specific hours" from 09:00–14:05 span). However, lacks ground truth's precision/specificity (no "18 events/four cases", "high variance/±5.56 pp.", "morning of 1 May 2025"; "daylight/days of week" slightly vaguer). +2.2/2.5
- **Overall**: Highly faithful to log/ground truth (no unjustified inferences, answers all questions). Minor issues prevent perfection under utmost strictness. Total differences minimal but penalized heavily per instructions.
