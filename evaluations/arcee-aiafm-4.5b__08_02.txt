The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect on both questions, directly contradicting the ground truth. It wrongly claims "No" for Q1, ignoring the parallel path (via T2-T7-T4) that enables T5 to fire using the P2 token without T3 consuming it first. The provided "explanation" for Q2 is flawed and unsubstantiated, failing to recognize the valid sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5). No credit for structure or word limit adherence, as the core analysis is entirely erroneous.
