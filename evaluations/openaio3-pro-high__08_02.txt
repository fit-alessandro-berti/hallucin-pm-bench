The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in answering "Yes" to Q1, providing the identical minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5) that reaches the key marking {P2, P5} enabling T5 before T3. The explanation correctly describes the token flow and explicitly notes T3 has not occurred, demonstrating the point within the word limit.

Minor deductions (-0.5) for lacking intermediate markings (M1–M4) and the post-T5 detail on T3 disabling (which adds confirmatory depth but is not strictly required). No factual errors.
