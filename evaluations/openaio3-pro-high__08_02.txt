**Score: 9.5**

**Justification:**  
The LLM answer matches the ground truth both in conclusion and in reasoning. The answer correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3 and gives an accurate minimal firing sequence (⟨T1, T2, T7, T4, T5⟩). The marking evolution is described in both. The explanation conveys that T5 can be enabled without T3 and clarifies why T3 can be skipped.

**Minor errors (justifying 0.5-point deduction):**
- The LLM answer’s phrase "Because both input places of T5 now hold a token..." is slightly imprecise versus the ground truth’s clarity in showing at each step which tokens are present.
- The LLM answer does not explicitly state the marking after every step, nor does it state that after T5, T3 will be disabled, which adds confirmation in the ground truth.
- The ground truth provides stepwise markings (M₁, M₂, ...) and an explicit final confirmation, while the LLM’s answer is a little less formal and omits this.

Despite these minor omissions in rigor or explicitness, the substantive logic, sequence, and conclusions align with the ground truth exactly.
