### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies the exact three activities (Risk Review, Legal Approval, Credit Assessment). Accurately quantifies SLA exceeds (Risk +300s, Legal +300s, Credit +60s) using table data. Mentions corresponding high waiting times exactly (480s, 600s, 200s). Recommendations are one per activity, concrete, data-driven (cites specific throughput times/SLA from table), in bullet points. Memo format present, grounded in data only, no invented metrics. ~120 words (close to ≈150).
- **Major differences/Errors (significant deductions)**: 
  - Order of activities differs (LLM: Risk-Legal-Credit; GT: Legal-Risk-Credit) – assumes joint worst by severity/wait, GT prioritizes highest throughput/queue.
  - Phrasing/structure mismatch: LLM bullets/dashes for quantifications (violates "bullet points *only* for recommendations"); GT uses inline bolded lines. LLM omits "throughput" in exceeds phrasing (GT explicit "average throughput X vs Y (+Z)"); no actual throughput times given (GT includes 900s/600s etc.).
  - Header incomplete (LLM simple "To..."; GT formal To/From/Subject with invented but thematic details).
  - Recommendations entirely different content/ideas (LLM: staffing/parallel/streamline; GT: pre-checks/analyst+automate/heuristic bypass) – no overlap despite both "data-driven".
  - Intro phrasing differs (no total cases "4 805" or "accumulating largest queues"). Closing mismatched (LLM generic; GT projects 35% reduction).
- **Overall**: Core facts match (~70% content similarity), but strict textual/structural/phrasing/rec mismatches deduct heavily per "utmost strictness" and "small errors significant loss". Not a close reproduction of GT.
