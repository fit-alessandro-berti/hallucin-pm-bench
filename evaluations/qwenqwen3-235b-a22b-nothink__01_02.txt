### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer is strong in identifying the core decision points (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval) and listing all required documents accurately in substance. It adheres to the prompt's instruction to use exact activity names without introducing standard loan terminology. However, under utmost strictness, several small but notable differences from the ground truth warrant deductions:

#### Decision Points (扣分: -1.0 total)
- All three points are correctly identified and summarized with branching logic.
- Minor inaccuracies:
  - Point 1 omits the ground truth's explicit "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split," reducing precision in process flow context.
  - Point 2 omits "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check," missing sequential placement; also phrases outcome as "escalation to the Micro-loan Board" instead of "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval," slightly altering terminology flow.
  - Point 3 adds "for applications with amounts ≥ €15 000," which is implied but not in ground truth, introducing redundancy.
- Unnecessary addition of step numbers (e.g., "Step 5") not present in ground truth, deviating from exact flow summarization.
- Minor formatting quirks (e.g., brackets around thresholds like ["< €15 000"]) differ from ground truth's clean bullets.

#### Required Documents (扣分: -0.8 total)
- All six documents are listed completely and in near-identical order.
- Small phrasing errors:
  - "Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)" adds "old," not in ground truth's "(≤ 3 months)."
  - "Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)" inserts "single" and uses "or" instead of ground truth's concise "(pay-stub/tax slip)."
  - "Community Impact Statement (CIS) Template" adds "Template," which is not in ground truth's "Community Impact Statement (CIS)."
  - Omits ground truth's parenthetical note "(No credit bureau report, collateral forms, or other standard loan documents are needed.)," which provides clarifying context aligned with the prompt's emphasis on non-standard process (though not explicitly required, its absence is a minor completeness gap).
- Extra closing sentence ("All documents above are mandatory...") adds interpretive content not in ground truth, violating strict adherence to listing "every required document" without elaboration.

The answer is comprehensive and faithful overall (~85% match), but these cumulative minor deviations (phrasing, omissions of contextual ties, extraneous details) prevent a perfect score. No major errors or hallucinations, but strict evaluation penalizes precision lapses significantly.
