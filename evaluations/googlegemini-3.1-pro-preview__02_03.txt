The LLM answer is factually perfect across all three questions, correctly identifying 3 cases (with matching list), Pack_Items as the immediate predecessor for C456's Ship_Order (verified by sorting timestamps: Create_Order 09:10 → Validate_Order 09:20 → Pack_Items 09:35 → Ship_Order 09:40), and Cancel_Order as the unique activity (appears once; all others appear 2–3 times). Bullet-point format matches the prompt's requirement.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for:
- Lack of explicit **A1**/**A2**/**A3** labels as in ground truth (structural difference, though 1:1 mapping is clear).
- Slightly verbose Q1 ("distinct cases" vs. "cases"; negligible).
- Conciseness violations via helpful but unrequested parentheticals in Q2/Q3 (timestamps/case details; ~10 extra words each, against "concise...only").

No factual/content errors; extras demonstrate analysis without harm. Under utmost strictness, not 10.0 due to format/verbosity diffs.
