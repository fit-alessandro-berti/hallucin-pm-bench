The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt's requirements with a correct explanation (no timestamps, only counts), matching the ground truth's core reasoning and conclusion. Minor deductions for slightly less precise phrasing (e.g., omits explicit mention of "start-to-completion intervals" and "duration information") under utmost strictness.
