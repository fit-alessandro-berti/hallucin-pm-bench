The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two concurrent task sets from Process B, matching the core content and order of the ground truth with no factual errors or extraneous information. It adheres to the prompt by numbering sets (via "Set 1", "Set 2") in appearance order and referencing the process description's "Parallel Split #1/#2" terminology precisely. Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for: stylistic formatting differences (Markdown headers/bullets vs. numbered list/inline `backticks` + ‖ symbol;  -0.4), lack of bolding and exact phrasing like "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**" (-0.2), absence of closing "No other tasks..." sentence (-0.2). Under utmost strictness, these cosmetic variances prevent a perfect score despite semantic equivalence.
