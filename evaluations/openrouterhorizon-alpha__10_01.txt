7.0

The LLM’s answer is quite good and strictly follows the vocabulary (using “KYC Review”, “Order Vetting”, “Payment Clearance”, and never mentions the forbidden terms or even hints at them). The structure and order of activities/roles are correct, and no unwarranted content is present.

However, upon close inspection, there are several significant deviations from the ground truth RACI allocation for some roles and activities:

**Errors / Loss of points:**

1. **KYC Review**:  
   - Ground truth: AM = A, CO = R, FC = C, IT = I  
   - LLM: AM = I, CO = R/A, FC = I, IT = I  
   - Mistake: LLM makes CO both R & A instead of just R; AM is I but should be A (Accountable); FC is I but should be C.

2. **Order Vetting**:  
   - LLM gives AM both R/A (correct); but FC is I (OK), IT is I (OK), but CO is C (correct).

3. **Payment Clearance**:  
   - Ground truth: AM = A, CO = C, FC = R, IT = I  
   - LLM: AM = I, CO = I, FC = R/A, IT = C  
   - Mistake: FC is both R/A but should be R only; IT is C but should be I; AM & CO are both I, but AM should be A, CO should be C.

4. **Record Update**:  
   - Ground truth: AM = C, CO = I, FC = C, IT = R  
   - LLM: AM = I, CO = I, FC = C, IT = R/A  
   - Mistake: AM should be C but is I; IT should be just R but is R/A.

5. **Notify Customer**:  
   - Ground truth: AM = R/A, others = I  
   - LLM: AM = R/A (OK), CO = I (OK), FC = I (OK), IT = C (wrong; should be I).

**Summary of issues:**  
While the forbidden terms are never used and the structure adheres to instructions, there are substantial misallocations of R, A, C, I values when compared strictly with the ground truth, especially for KYC Review, Payment Clearance, Record Update, Notify Customer (for IT), and so on.

**Strictness adjustment:**  
Since the vocabulary was flawless but RACI specifics had several errors, a significant deduction is warranted—thus, 7.0 is justified. These are not trivial errors, as RACI misallocations can have major implications in process mapping.

If not for those discrepancies, the answer would have scored 10.0.
