The LLM answer correctly uses the mandated terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) without forbidden variants and lists the activities and roles without extras. However, it fails significantly in RACI accuracy against the ground truth, with mismatches in at least 4 out of 6 activities (e.g., KYC Review: AM I vs. A, CO R/A vs. R, FC I vs. C; Payment Clearance: AM I vs. A, CO I vs. C, FC R/A vs. R, IT C vs. I; Record Update: AM I vs. C, IT R/A vs. R; Notify Customer: IT C vs. I). This violates the rubric's correctness criterion for RACI allocations reflecting the narrative (e.g., inconsistent Responsible/Accountable assignments, missing Consulted roles). The format is a semi-structured list rather than a proper matrix/table, further deviating from the ground truth presentation. Under strict evaluation, these multiple errors (even small per row) warrant substantial point deduction from a perfect score.
