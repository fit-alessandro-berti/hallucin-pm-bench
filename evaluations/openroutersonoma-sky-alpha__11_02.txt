7.2

**Justification:**

Strengths:
- The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities: Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment.
- It references relevant metrics from the table for each activity (wait time, throughput, processing time, SLA breach, rework rate, etc.).
- The recommendations are data-driven and plausible.
- The memo is concise, well-structured, and stays under the word limit.

Critical Differences/Errors:
1. **Metric Precision:**
   - The LLM exaggerates a little (though not grossly) on Request_Documents: "cutting rework by 50% based on similar industry benchmarks"—this is not strictly data-based in this context (the prompt prohibits outside data/supposition).
   - It claims actions could boost process efficiency by 15-20%. This is an unsupported and speculative statement (ground truth only forecasts ≈10%).
   - The recommendation for Initial_Assessment – "Allocate additional staff during peak hours" – is generic; the ground truth is more directly tied to the table (automation/rules-engine for routing).
   - Review_Documents: measure focuses on checklist standardization, which may not as directly address speed/variability as "AI-assisted classification plus a rotating specialist squad" in the ground truth. Ground truth proposals are more tailored and robustly reasoned, closely mapping recommendations to the precise issues identified.
2. **Interpretation:**
   - The LLM infers "throughput drops" for Request_Documents. While it does drop, the ground truth more directly anchors the interpretation to the queue and rework data, not just throughput.
   - For Initial_Assessment, the LLM says "contributing to downstream throughput drops." This link is plausible but not explicitly present in the table—ground truth more cautiously frames congestion as a consequence.
   - It mentions "if numbers do not differentiate, say so". The LLM does not comment on places where this might apply (though numbers are relatively clear here).

3. **Actionability:**
   - The LLM actions, while reasonable, lack some of the concrete specificity (file-format validation, AI-assistance, rule-engine) present in the ground truth.
   - LLM occasionally generalizes (e.g., “allocate additional staff”) rather than recommending a more nuanced, process-based intervention.

**Summary:**  
The LLM mostly gets the correct answers and identifies the right numbers, but loses points for:
- Extrapolating impacts without clear basis from the data provided,
- Offering slightly less targeted recommendations,
- Making some minor inferences not strictly grounded in the table.

Thus, **7.2** reflects a solid, mostly accurate answer with clear room for improvement in adherence to the data and prompt constraints.
