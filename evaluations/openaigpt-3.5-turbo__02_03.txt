9.2

### Evaluation:
- **Q1**: Correct count (3), but lacks the explicit list of cases (C123, C456, C789) present in ground truth; phrasing is more verbose ("There are 3 distinct cases present in the fragment" vs. "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)"). Minor deduction for not matching detail and conciseness (-0.4).
- **Q2**: Correct ("Pack_Items"), but full sentence restates question unnecessarily, reducing conciseness vs. ground truth's direct "Pack\_Items" (-0.2). Escaped underscore minor difference.
- **Q3**: Correct ("Cancel_Order"), same issue with verbose phrasing vs. direct "Cancel\_Order" (-0.2).
- **Overall**: Perfect factual accuracy and bullet-point format matching prompt instruction. Strong match to ground truth content, but strict penalties for phrasing verbosity, missing case list, absent A1/A2/A3 labels, and minor formatting (quotes, no bold/escapes). High score reflects near-exact semantic match despite small presentational differences.
