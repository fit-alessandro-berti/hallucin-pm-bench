6.0

**Justification:**

**a) Decision Points**

- The LLM correctly identifies the two main decision points:
  1. The conditional skip after the Tri-Color-Risk-Check;
  2. The TriVote approval gate.
- However, it erroneously lists two additional "decision points":
    - The Tri-Color-Risk-Check itself (which is an input/gate but not a *decision*; it's the *output* of this step that serves as the basis for the conditional);
    - Applicant confirmation—receiving the signed Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix—is procedurally required but is not a *decision point/conditional branch* in the approval process, but merely a required completion before finalization.
- Each true branch is described acceptably in a sentence, but the presence of extraneous "decision points" is a significant deduction.

**b) Required Documents (in-order):**

- The answer lists:
    1. Form 14B
    2. Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow (grouped, but correct in order)
    3. Deck Memo *(notes conditional)*
    4. Offer Sheet 77
    5. ID Matrix Declaration *(but omits explicit “Signed Offer Sheet 77” as a listed document, and places ID Matrix Declaration after Offer Sheet 77 instead of as its own subsequent item)*
    6. Loan Dossier 2025
- Key problems:
    - “Signed Offer Sheet 77” is missing as a distinct document in the list.
    - ID Matrix Declaration is present, but not strictly in perfect order if one accepts “signed Offer Sheet 77” as distinct.
    - Scorecards are grouped, but they do appear individually in the ground truth answer, so some penalty needed.
    - The note about which documents are applicant-supplied is inessential, but not harmful.

**Other Considerations:**

- No hallucinated KYC/AML/credit-bureau documents or steps are introduced (good).
- All documents mentioned in the process are listed, none invented.
- The spirit of the two real decision points is captured, even if padded with unnecessary ones.

**Scoring Summary:**
- Major errors (extraneous “decision points”, not all documents perfectly listed and ordered, missing “Signed Offer Sheet 77”) keep it below 7.0.
- The answer is comprehensive and careful, not misleading, contains no hallucinations, and captures the high-level logic of the process; thus, above 5.0.

**Strict, detail-focused grading yields a 6.0 for this response.**
