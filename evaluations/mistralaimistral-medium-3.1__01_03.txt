3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Evaluating with utmost strictness, the LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, completeness, and accuracy, warranting a low score. Small errors (e.g., added notes, grouping) compound into major losses.

**Part a) Assessment (major deductions: ~50% weight)**:
- Ground truth identifies exactly **two** decision points: (1) the risk-based skip (conditional branch in step 4), and (2) TriVote (approval gate in step 6). Both are described concisely as rules.
- LLM incorrectly lists **four** items, inflating the count:
  - Item 1 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check): This is not a decision point/gate/branch; it's an input-generating step (step 3). Ground truth treats it as the precursor to the actual decision, not the decision itself—complete mismatch.
  - Item 2 (Conditional Skip): Mostly accurate but omits the implicit "otherwise proceed" clause, reducing precision.
  - Item 3 (TriVote): Accurate, but phrasing ("any two approvals out of three suffice to pass" vs. ground truth's "at least two... record 'Approve'") is a minor reword, yet strictness demands exact rule mirroring.
  - Item 4 (Applicant Confirmation): Not a decision point, gate, or conditional branch in the process—step 8 is a linear request/wait, not a branch. This is a hallucinated addition, violating the "every decision point" scope.
- Overall: Extraneous items, incorrect categorization, and verbosity (e.g., bullet formatting) stray from ground truth's tight, numbered summary. Significant loss for over-inclusion and misidentification.

**Part b) Assessment (major deductions: ~50% weight)**:
- Ground truth lists **nine** distinct documents in strict first-appearance order, without notes, classifications, or grouping: Form 14B → three scorecards separately → Deck Memo → Offer Sheet 77 → Signed Offer Sheet 77 → ID Matrix Declaration → Loan Dossier 2025.
- LLM lists only **six** items, with errors:
  - Groups Scorecard–Cyan, Magenta, Yellow as one bullet (vs. separate lines 2–4 in ground truth)—this merges distinct items, losing granularity.
  - Lists Deck Memo correctly but adds "(only if not skipped)", which is interpretive and absent from ground truth (process implies it's required when not skipped, but list is unconditional first-appearance).
  - Lists Offer Sheet 77 once (step 7), but ground truth separates it from "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (step 8) as a distinct required document—LLM's "signed alongside" note conflates them, omitting the signed version as a separate entry.
  - ID Matrix Declaration is listed, but tied to the signed offer note, disrupting pure order.
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC mentions), which avoids further deduction, but incompleteness (missing signed version as separate; only 6 vs. 9 items) is a critical gap.
- Overall: Incomplete enumeration, added qualifiers ("Note: These are inputs...", "internal bank document"), and grouping deviate from ground truth's plain, exhaustive list. Strictness penalizes this as failure to match format and content precisely.

**Total Score Justification**: Core requirements unmet in both parts (wrong count/completeness in a); incomplete/merged list in b)). No perfect alignment, even in phrasing—3.5 reflects substantial but not total failure (e.g., no outright fabrications beyond extras).
