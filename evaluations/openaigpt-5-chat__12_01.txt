The LLM answer accurately identifies the fact as **inaccurate**, matches the verdict of the ground truth, and provides precise references, noting for each case the correct order (including absence of `Update_Inventory` in Case 1002 and the reversed/concurrent order in the others). 

**Small discrepancies:**
- The LLM answer states for Case 1003 that `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund`, with `Quality_Check` in between, and underscores that the two are not immediately consecutive and the order is reversed. This is correct and indeed goes into detail.
- However, unlike the ground truth, it does not cite specific "line numbers". Also, although it correctly stresses the reversal of ordering, it does not clarify, as the ground truth does, that the fact is also trivially false because in Case 2 the activity pair never even both occurs ("so 'always' is already disproved"). This is a subtle nuance: the ground truth points out the logical threshold for disproof more explicitly.

**Overall:**  
The answer is thorough, fully correct, and very explicit in its justification. The missing explicit reference to line numbers and the subtlety about the logical standard means a small deduction, but this is a strong answer.

**Score: 9.0**
