**4.0**

### Evaluation Summary (strict criteria applied):
- **R1**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification acceptable but omits explicit reference to `total_amount > €10 000` (minor deduction; -0.2).
- **R2**: Status **wrong** (Compliant vs. ground truth Violated). Justification fundamentally incorrect—fails to recognize post-Change_Request Manager_Approval (03-07) as the "last required approval," making Ship_Goods (03-05) non-compliant with "within 2 days **after**" timing (major error; -3.0).
- **R3**: Status correct (Violated). Justification matches closely (no deduction).
- **R4**: Status correct (Not Applicable). Justification equivalent (no deduction).
- **R5**: Status correct (Violated). Justification partially incomplete—mentions Ship_Goods but omits Pay_Invoice as further processing before new approval (small error; -0.5).
- **R6**: Status correct (Compliant). Justification matches (no deduction).
- **Overall**: Correct (NON-COMPLIANT), but undermined by per-rule inaccuracies.
- **Format**: Matches prompt (per-rule status + ≤20-word justification + all-caps conclusion).
- **Total**: Base 10.0 minus deductions for differences (esp. major R2 error) = 4.0. Strictness applied: wrong status/justification on even one rule warrants heavy penalty; incompletenesses compound loss.
