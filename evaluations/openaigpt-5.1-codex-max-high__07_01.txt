The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual changes (added `check_vip` and `generate_qr`, removed `send_rma_label`, `gw_valid` type change from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway), with no extras or speculation, matching the core content of the ground truth. However, under utmost strictness:

- Headings are not exactly matched: missing the specified "•" prefix and lacking **bold** formatting as in ground truth.
- Task listings use only bare IDs (e.g., "- check_vip") instead of full descriptive names with ID details (e.g., "* Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"), deviating significantly from ground truth detail and potentially misinterpreting "element names" (XML has both `id` and `name` attributes).
- List bullets use "-" instead of "*".
- Gateway change phrasing is concise ("gw_valid: exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway") but lacks ground truth's verbose structure, bolding, and version labels ("`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)").
- No trailing note, but this is minor as not required.

These formatting, phrasing, and detail omissions (especially names) are small errors but warrant significant deduction per instructions (~3 points off perfect).
