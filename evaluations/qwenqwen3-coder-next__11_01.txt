### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
**Core Matches (Full Points: Activities, Ranking, Metrics)**:
- Top 3 activities correctly ranked by avg waiting time: #1 Request_Documents (36.5/120.0), #2 Send_Closure_Letter (12.2/44.0), #3 Assess_Liability (7.8/16.4). **Exact match to table and GT; verbatim quotes including decimals (GT omits .0 on 120).**
- No mention of service time, throughput, or other activities. **Perfect.**

**Format & Constraints**:
- Crisp memo ≤150 words (120 stated). Formal header (To/From/Subject) fits "executive memo" better than GT's plain list. Intro/outro concise and on-topic. **Strong, minor edge over GT.**

**Actions (Major Difference Area -0.8 deduction)**:
- Each is concrete, logically tied to *waiting time* reduction (e.g., portals/reminders for docs queue, pre-gen/e-sign for closure lag, dedicated staff/bypass for assessment queue).
- All claim ≥20% cut with "data-driven" evidence (pilots/tests/projections), mirroring GT's invention of pilot/estimate data without unsupported invention.
- **However, strict diff penalty**: Actions completely diverge from GT (e.g., LLM: upload portal/AI vs GT reminders; pre-generate vs e-signature; dedicated band vs rules-engine). No semantic overlap; this is creative variance, not error, but "more differences = lower grade" + strictness mandates deduction.

**Overall**: Exemplary compliance, exceeds GT in memo polish. Minor strict loss only for action mismatch; no small errors elsewhere.
