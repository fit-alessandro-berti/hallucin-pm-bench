The LLM answer is correct in both the Yes/No component and its justification. It identifies and clearly explains the relevant cases (C002 and C004) where "Validate_Payment" does not follow "Receive_Order" immediately, accurately refuting the FACT. The answer also acknowledges that C003 is a compliant case, though the explanation is a bit wordy compared to the ground truthâ€™s more systematic approach.

**Loss of 1 point:**  
- The justification is slightly less rigorous than the ground truth: the ground truth gives a clear tabular, case-by-case analysis, directly answering for all four cases, and explicitly marks "Immediate successor?" for each.
- The LLM answer mentions C003, but does not explicitly mention C001; instead, it omits the explicit statement about C001, which, for strict grading, is a significant gap given the prompt ("small errors should reflect in significant loss").
- The LLM does not confirm all cases in a structured manner; instead, it focuses mainly on those that violate the statement. Full coverage is required for maximum points.

Overall, the response is technically correct and well-justified, but lacks the exhaustive, structured enumeration found in the ground truth.
