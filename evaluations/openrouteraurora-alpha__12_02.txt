The LLM answer is nearly identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and accuracy: both correctly answer "No" and cite the exact same counterexamples (C003 lines 6-7; C005 line 11 with no prior Receive_Order), using one-paragraph justification per the prompt. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., plain "No" vs. "**No**"; "no preceding Receive_Order for that case" vs. "never contains Receive_Order at all"; continuous paragraph vs. bulleted list) do not introduce errors or omissions, fully matching the factual requirements under strict evaluation.
