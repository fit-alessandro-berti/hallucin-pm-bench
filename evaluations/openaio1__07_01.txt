7.0

• Added tasks  
  - The LLM answer lists only the task IDs ("check_vip", "generate_qr") rather than both the name and ID as in the ground truth ("Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)", etc.). This is a significant omission.

• Removed tasks  
  - Same as above, the LLM only lists the ID ("send_rma_label") rather than including the name and ID ("Send RMA Label (id = `send_rma_label`)"). 

• Gateway type changes  
  - The LLM answer is correct on content, but the format is less clear and omits bold type names and the explicit version notation.

Other aspects:
- The LLM correctly reported only the strictly factual differences and fit the required headings, though the formatting and level of detail do not match the ground truth standard.
- No extra/incorrect information is included.

Penalties:
- Omission of task names and ID formatting: -2
- Gateway type change description lacks formatting and clarity found in the ground truth: -1

Final score: 7.0
