6.0

**Reasoning:**

**Strengths:**  
- The answer strictly uses the mandated vocabulary: "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance"â€”never the forbidden terms.  
- Only the requested roles and activities appear; no unwarranted content.

**Errors / Deviations from Ground Truth:**  
1. **RACI Allocations Incorrect or Incomplete:**  
    - The matrix uses single "R" or "A" marks per cell, but omits crucial *multiple designations* (e.g., "R/A" for Account Manager).
    - Some roles lack correct C (Consulted) or I (Informed) status per the ground truth:
      - e.g., Compliance Officer should be "C" or "I" on many steps, not just blank.
      - Finance Clerk and IT Support are entirely absent (all blanks) for certain steps where ground truth mandates at least "I" or "C".
2. **Notify Customer:** Misses the multiple involvement ("R/A") for Account Manager, lacks proper designations for others.
3. **Legend Slight Mismatch:** The legend omits "C" and "I", which the ground truth includes and is standard on strict RACI matrices.
4. **Formats:** The matrix aesthetic is acceptable but not ground truth-aligned (ground truth bolds key cells and displays multiple designations per role, which the LLM answer does not).

**Impact:**  
- The answer gives a plausible RACI, but its Roles/Activities assignments are materially incomplete and inexact compared to the ground truth: several stakeholders are missing as C/I, and the dual "R/A" assignments are not captured wherever needed.
- Each missed or oversimplified designation represents a significant error given the explicit instruction for strictness.

**Final Justification:**  
Because:
- The vocabulary is perfect (no penalty for synonyms).
- The RACI assignments are **materially** but not **catastrophically** wrong (missing many Cs/I's and joint R/A's).
- No unwarranted content was added.

A score of 6.0 reflects a notable but not failing performance under strict evaluation.
