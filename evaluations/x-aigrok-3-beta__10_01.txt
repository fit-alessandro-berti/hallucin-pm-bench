4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology (partial credit, +2.0)**: Correctly uses all mandated terms ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms appear. However, lacks bolding/formatting emphasis on these terms as in ground truth, which is a minor but noticeable deviation under strict scrutiny (-0.5 implied in overall).
- **Structure and Format (partial credit, +1.5)**: Activities and roles are correctly listed as rows/columns, no extras introduced. Uses abbreviations (AM, CO, etc.) not present in ground truth, and includes unwarranted legend/explanatory text ("Below is the RACI matrix..."), violating "unwarranted content" in rubric (-1.0). Dashes (-) imply "not involved" without distinguishing C/I, unlike ground truth's explicit R/A/C/I usage.
- **RACI Assignments (major errors, -3.5 from base)**: Core failures here. Each activity has one Responsible (matches rubric), but assignments diverge significantly from ground truth and narrative:
  - Omits Consulted (C) and Informed (I) roles entirely (e.g., Receive Application has C for CO, I for FC/IT in ground truth; LLM uses - for all except AM).
  - Unwarranted Accountable (A) assignments for AM (e.g., A in KYC Review and Payment Clearance; ground truth has them but with broader involvement).
  - Misses combined R/A in cells (e.g., ground truth has R/A for AM in Receive Application, Order Vetting, Notify Customer).
  - Inaccurate per-activity details (e.g., Record Update lacks C for AM/FC in LLM; Payment Clearance omits C for CO and I for IT). These are not "small errors"â€”they fundamentally alter responsibility mapping, contradicting the narrative's implied oversight/involvement and rubric's emphasis on exact reflection.
- **Overall Correctness and Fidelity (low, +1.0)**: Adheres to no extra tasks/roles, but the matrix does not "reflect the narrative" fully due to sparsity and mismatches. No self-awareness issues (N/A). Total reflects strict deduction for pervasive differences, especially in RACI core.
