**8.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies all changes: 3 added tasks (by ID), 1 removed task (by ID), and the exact gateway type change (using XML element names). No extraneous changes are listed, aligning with instructions to ignore cosmetics/reordering. However, under utmost strictness:

- **Significant deductions (-1.0 total)**: Lists only task IDs without names in bold + `(ID)` format as in ground truth (e.g., "**Verify Identity** (`Task_VerifyIdentity`)"); this makes summaries less descriptive/readable.
- **Moderate deductions (-0.5 total)**: Unnumbered bullets instead of numbered lists; gateway description uses XML tags (`exclusiveGateway`) instead of semantic BPMN terms ("**exclusive** (XOR)" → "**inclusive** (OR)"); lacks "in *v1* to *v2*" specificity and closing note.
- **Minor deductions (-0.5 total)**: Headings use "###" markdown vs. "* **" style; no introductory "## **Expected Answer Key**".

Core content is accurate and complete (9.5/10 equivalent), but presentation/style differences vs. ground truth warrant deductions per strict criteria.
