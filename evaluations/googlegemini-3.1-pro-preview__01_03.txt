**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a) [~4.5/5.0]:** Accurately identifies both decision points with rules closely matching the process and ground truth (e.g., Low/Medium + ≤ €250k skip; any two approvals suffice). Minor deductions for phrasing ("€250,000 or less" vs. "≤ €250 000"; "any two... suffice to pass" vs. "at least two... record 'Approve'") and format (bullets with step refs vs. numbered plain), but content is precise—no extras/misses.
- **Part (b) [~2.5/5.0]:** Lists all unique documents correctly identified (no hallucinations), in proper first-appearance order up to Deck Memo. **Major errors:** (1) Combines "Offer Sheet 77" (first at step 7) and "Signed Offer Sheet 77" (first at step 8) into one slashed entry (#6), failing to treat them as distinct documents as per process/ground truth; (2) Results in only 8 items vs. ground truth's 9, shifting subsequent order (#7 ID vs. #8; #8 Loan vs. #9); (3) Adds extraneous step notes/parentheticals (*e.g.*, skip note on Deck Memo; steps on all), deviating from "list... in the order they first appear" simplicity. These are not small—direct mismatches in completeness/structure.
- **Overall:** High fidelity but b)'s document distinction/count error warrants ~30% penalty (strict per instructions). No policy violations or unrelated issues.
