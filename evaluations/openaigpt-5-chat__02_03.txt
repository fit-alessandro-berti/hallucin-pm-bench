9.5

- The LLM answer is almost entirely correct and closely matches the ground truth answer.
- The only (minor) difference is a stylistic one: for question 1, the LLM explicitly lists the case values in parentheses (with backticks), whereas the ground truth lists them as plain text without code formatting. The question did not request a specific output format for the listing.  
- For questions 2 and 3, the LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in content and order.

Per the strict grading guidelines, even very small deviations (such as output format unless explicitly required) merit a visible penalty. Thus, the answer is graded at 9.5.
