9.2

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Correctness (full marks here)**: Both answers correctly identify **No** as the verdict. LLM accurately cites the two counterexamples (C002 with "Pack_Items"; C004 with "Check_Fraud") with precise activity sequences, directly disproving "always" (sufficient per task: "citing the relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences"). No factual errors; relies only on log evidence.
- **Completeness (minor deduction -0.5)**: LLM focuses on *relevant* (violating) cases only, which is logically minimal to refute "always." Ground truth adds exhaustive case-by-case table (including C001/C003 affirmatives and 2/4 count), providing fuller verification. Strictness penalizes lack of this comprehensiveness.
- **Format & Presentation (minor deduction -0.3)**: LLM uses clean bullets (bolded for readability); ground truth uses structured table with ✅/❌, sequences, and notes. Task doesn't mandate table, but ground truth's polish is superior; small stylistic gap.
- **Conciseness & Clarity (neutral)**: LLM is succinct yet clear; no verbosity or fluff.

Overall: Extremely close match (98% alignment), but strict per-instruction differences in exhaustiveness/format warrant slight deduction from 10.0. No significant errors.
