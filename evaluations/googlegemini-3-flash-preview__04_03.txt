The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance ("No") and the key violation (Rule 3: NA before RA), with accurate assessments for Rules 2 and 4. However, it deductibly errs by incorrectly labeling Rule 1 as "Violation" (despite acknowledging QE precedes RA and both occur once), misattributing the NA interleaving issue to Rule 1 instead of Rule 3. This substantive analytical error, inconsistent self-hedging ("satisfied but..."), and non-tabular format deviate from the ground truth's precise, error-free rule-by-rule breakdown, warranting a strict deduction despite strong overall alignment.
