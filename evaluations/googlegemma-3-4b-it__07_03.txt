7.0

**Comments:**  
The LLM answer gets most of the information correct, including all gateway type changes and all added tasks. However, it incorrectly omits a removed task: "Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)", which is present in v1 but not in v2. It also lists "None" under REMOVED TASKS, which is inaccurate. The grouping and naming otherwise show close adherence to the requirements. This is a significant error (missed removal), warranting a reduction to 7.0 despite partial accuracy elsewhere.
