The LLM answer correctly identifies all added tasks (though in a different order) and the gateway type changes (with minor formatting differences, such as lack of extra spaces in the second gateway entry). However, it fails critically by missing the removal of Task_ManualReview entirely, incorrectly stating "None" under REMOVED TASKS, which omits a verifiable functional change present in v1 but absent in v2. This is a major error under the strict requirement to summarize *all* changes without omission. Additionally, the use of bold headings and bullet points deviates from the plain-text, verbatim format implied by the ground truth and prompt instructions, warranting further point deduction for non-compliance with output structure.
