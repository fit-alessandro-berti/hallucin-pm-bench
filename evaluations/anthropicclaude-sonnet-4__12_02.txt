The LLM answer is highly accurate, correctly identifying both key counterexamples (C003 and C005) with precise citations to lines and case-IDs, mirroring the ground truth's focus on why the "always" claim fails. It appropriately structures as "No" followed by a single-paragraph justification and adds no factual errors. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs a minor deduction for including extraneous details about positive cases (C001, C002, C004) not present in the ground truth, which slightly deviates from the concise, counterexample-only emphasis, and for referencing line 12 in C005 (irrelevant to the specific claim but not incorrect).
