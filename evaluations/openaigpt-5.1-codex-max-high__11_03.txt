### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment)**: Correctly identifies the exact same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times. Precisely quantifies SLA excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and references waiting times (600s, 480s, 200s) identically. Uses bullets **only** for recommendations. Stays grounded in table data (no invented totals like ground truth's "4 805 cases", no projections, no non-data specifics like "€25k"). Memo length ≈150 words. Returns only memo text.
- **Weaknesses (significant deductions for strictness)**: Header incomplete (no "From", shorter "To", different subject without date/sample reference). Identifies activities in paragraph vs. ground truth's bolded list format. Introductory phrasing/style differs (e.g., "significantly breaching SLAs while incurring the highest waiting times" vs. "materially breach service targets while accumulating the largest queues"). Recommendations differ entirely in content/specificity (LLM: generic capacity/wait-focused; ground truth: invented rule-based/analyst/heuristic actions) – major divergence despite both being "concrete/data-driven." No closing projection sentence. These stylistic/content mismatches deduct heavily under "utmost strictness" and "small errors reflect in significant loss." 

Overall: Excellent core content match (9.5/10), but format/phrasing/recs differences drop to 8.0.
