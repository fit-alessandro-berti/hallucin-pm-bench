**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Q1**: Completely incorrect (says "4 distinct cases" but lists only 3; ground truth is exactly 3). Major factual error → full deduction.
- **Q2**: Second bullet matches "Pack_Items" correctly → partial credit.
- **Q3**: Fourth bullet "Create_Order" is wrong (appears 3x; ground truth is "Cancel_Order" which appears exactly 1x). Third bullet is nonsensical/irrelevant (misinterprets events, adds unasked explanation) → full deduction.
- **Format/Conciseness**: Violates "concise, bullet-point answers only" (4 misaligned bullets, extra rambling explanation). Not matching ground truth structure → significant deduction.
- Overall: Only ~1/3 correct with severe formatting/factual deviations; strict policy demands heavy penalties for all errors.
