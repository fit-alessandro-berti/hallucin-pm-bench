3.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies overall non-compliance ("No"), but contains major factual errors in the justification that misrepresent multiple rules, diverging significantly from the ground truth. Specifically:

- Rule 1 is incorrectly flagged as violated (claiming RA must follow QE "immediately" and cannot be after NA); ground truth confirms it is satisfied, as the rule only requires order (QE before RA), not immediacy.
- Rule 2 is incorrectly flagged as violated (claiming VP is not after both QE and RA); ground truth confirms it is satisfied, as VP follows RA (which follows QE).
- Rule 3 is correctly identified as violated, matching ground truth.
- Rule 4 is incorrectly dismissed as "not applicable" due to upstream issues; ground truth confirms it is satisfied (CC after NA and VP).

These errors invert the assessment of three out of four rules, undermining the justification's accuracy and reliability. No credit for formatting or brevity, as the core analysis is substantively flawed.
