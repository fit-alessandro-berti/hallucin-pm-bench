The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed task, and gateway type changes) with accurate IDs and names, matching the ground truth content precisely. However, it deviates in formatting: headings include unnecessary "###" markdown (violating "verbatim" requirement), all task and gateway elements use extraneous backticks not present in the ground truth, and the gateway lines lack the alignment spacing seen in the ground truth (e.g., extra spaces before the second gateway's change). These small but consistent formatting errors warrant a deduction under strict evaluation criteria, though the core output is highly faithful.
