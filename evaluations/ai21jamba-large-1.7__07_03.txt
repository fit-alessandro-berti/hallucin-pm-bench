The LLM answer contains all required information, but its formatting does not match the verbatim section headings stipulated in the prompt and present in the ground truth answer (e.g., "### ADDED TASKS" instead of "ADDED TASKS" without extra formatting). Additionally, tasks are listed with backticks and parentheses rather than the simple format required by the instructions (e.g., `Task_FraudCheck` (`Automated Fraud Check`) instead of Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)). These small formatting and presentation discrepancies amount to significant point deductions per the instruction to be utmost strict. However, factually, all differences are complete and correct, so the answer remains high.
