7.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (high alignment, justifying base above 5.0)**: Perfect match on the three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment—in same order), exact quantification of SLA exceedances (+300s, +300s, +60s), and inclusion of waiting times. Structure mirrors GT closely (header, intro summary, bulleted activity list, bolded recommendations header + bullets, closing). Memo format followed, ~180 words (near ~150 target). No extraneous data/metrics invented beyond data grounding; recommendations are concrete and tied to observed high waits/breaches (e.g., % reductions derived from wait/throughput gaps).
- **Weaknesses (deductions for differences, per strictness)**: 
  - Headers/subject/from/date diverge significantly (invented date "12 February 2026"; "Senior Process-Performance Analyst" vs. GT's "Process Performance Office"; different subject phrasing)—1.0 deduction.
  - Intro phrasing/content differs (no total cases "4 805" or "queues"/"loan-origination"; "performance gaps" vs. "breach service targets")—0.5 deduction.
  - Activity descriptions rephrased ("throughput time is X s, exceeding by Y s" vs. "throughput X s vs. Z s SLA (+Y s)") with minor formatting diffs (e.g., em-dashes, thin spaces, bold placement)—0.5 deduction.
  - **Recommendations entirely different actions** despite both being inventive/data-tied (parallel workflow/30% vs. pre-checks bypass; auto-scoring/150s vs. add analyst; dashboard/20% vs. straight-through €25k)—major content divergence on core requirement, -2.0 deduction.
  - Closing diverges ("grounded in bottlenecks... SLA envelope" vs. "projected 35% end-to-end... compliance")—0.5 deduction.
  - Minor formatting (full bold **To:** vs. *To:*; - vs. • bullets)—0.5 deduction.

Net: Strong factual/core compliance (9/10) offset by textual/creative diffs (-2.0 total), yielding 7.0. Lower would undervalue semantic match; higher ignores strict "differences" mandate.
