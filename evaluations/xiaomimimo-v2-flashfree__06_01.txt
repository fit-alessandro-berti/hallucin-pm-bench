8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B: (Create_Documentation, Quality_Check) and (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines), with correct alphabetical ordering *within* each pair. This matches the ground truth content and rationale perfectly.

However, under utmost strictness:
- The **overall list order is reversed** (Procure_Materials first instead of Create_Documentation), directly violating the explicit requirement to "Return the pairs in **alphabetical order** [...] in your overall list." This is a significant error (-1.5 points).
- **Formatting differences**: No column alignment (ground truth pads "Procure_Materials     —" to align the "—" symbols); inconsistent or fewer spaces around "—". While the per-line format is close, it does not precisely match (-0.5 points).

Semantically perfect (10.0 base), but deductions for clear violations result in 8.0. Smaller lists amplify order errors.
