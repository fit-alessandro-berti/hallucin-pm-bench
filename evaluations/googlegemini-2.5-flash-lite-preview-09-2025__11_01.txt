8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (9/10)**: The three activities (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability) are accurately identified and ranked by average waiting time (36.5 > 12.2 > 7.8), matching the table. Both average and 95th-percentile times are quoted verbatim for each.
- **Format and Constraints (8/10)**: Crisp memo style with table is executive-appropriate and under 150 words (~120). No discussion of service-time, throughput, or other activities. Minor deduction for extraneous closing sentence on "lead time," which borders on unwarranted (though not explicitly prohibited).
- **Actions (7/10)**: Concrete and logically tied to waiting issues (e.g., reminders for document delays, staff dedication for queues, triage for prioritization). However, they lack explicit "data-driven" elements (e.g., no references to pilots, estimates, or analysis justifying â‰¥20% reduction, unlike ground truth). Percentages are not stated, reducing precision against prompt.

Overall, strong on core facts but differences in action specificity and evidence (vs. ground truth's quantified, sourced recommendations) warrant deductions under strict criteria.
