9.5

- The LLM answer is completely correct in substance, and all three answers match the ground truth in meaning.
- The only minor deviation is stylistic: the LLM uses slightly more verbose formatting (e.g., "There are 3 distinct cases:") instead of the strict bullet form requested, and one extra space after the colon; also, it bolds some terms.
- Since the instruction was to be "concise, bullet-point answers only," and these go a bit beyond conciseness and bullet form, a very small deduction is warranted.
- No factual or logical errors detected.

Final score: 9.5
