4.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the three worst-performing activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, matching the ground truth exactly. Quantification of SLA excesses (+300s, +300s, +60s) and waiting times is precise and similarly phrased, grounding both in the table data without invention.

However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions apply for multiple deviations:
- **Structure and format (major loss: -2.0 points)**: Lacks formal memo elements like To/From/Subject line and introductory context (e.g., total cases of 4,805, even if approximate). Ground truth frames it as a professional executive memo; LLM starts abruptly without this, violating the "executive memo" intent. Bullets are used correctly for recommendations, but no subheader ("**Recommended actions**") and no closing projection on impact.
- **Content length and completeness (moderate loss: -1.0 point)**: ≈180 words vs. ground truth's ≈150; includes an extra explanatory sentence on selection criteria (helpful but not in ground truth) while omitting holistic summary (e.g., end-to-end cycle time reduction).
- **Recommendations (major loss: -2.5 points)**: Bullets are data-driven (referencing specific waiting/SLA reductions), concrete, and tied to table metrics, but differ entirely in substance from ground truth. LLM's are generic (e.g., "priority lane," "queue policy") without tailored, inventive details like "rule-based pre-checks," "add one risk analyst," or "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k." This represents a complete mismatch in the action specifics, a core prompt requirement, despite both being "data-driven."
- **Minor issues (small but penalized strictly: -0.0 additional, as covered)**: No invention of absent metrics/activities, but phrasing lacks ground truth's emphasis (e.g., bolding, "+ notation") and polished tone.

Overall, strong alignment on core analysis (≈70% match) but failures in memo professionalism, recommendation specificity, and completeness justify a mid-low score.
