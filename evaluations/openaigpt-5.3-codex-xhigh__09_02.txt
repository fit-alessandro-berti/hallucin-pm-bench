**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth, correctly identifying the absence of timestamps (phrased as "timestamp pairs" for precision on cycle time calculation) versus only counts, in a single concise sentence matching the prompt's requirements. Minor stylistic differences (e.g., "cannot be calculated" vs. "impossible to compute"; "artefacts" vs. none; "elapsed minutes" tying to units) do not introduce errors or omissions under strict evaluation.
