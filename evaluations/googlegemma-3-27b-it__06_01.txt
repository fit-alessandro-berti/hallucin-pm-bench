The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth in content, pairs identified, alphabetical ordering (within pairs and overall list), and required format. The only minor variation appears to be whitespace alignment in presentation (e.g., extra spaces in the ground truth for visual alignment), but this is not mandated by the prompt's specified format and does not constitute an error. No deductions apply.
