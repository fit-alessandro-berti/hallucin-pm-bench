9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies both pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel and lists them in the required format. However, there is a minor formatting discrepancy: the LLM answer uses single spaces throughout, whereas the ground truth aligns the dashes using extra spaces (specifically, a gap after "Procure_Materials" to align the columns).

While the meaning and content are correct, the strictness criterion demands a significant point deduction for any discrepancies, even minor formatting ones. Therefore, the LLM answer receives a 9.0.
