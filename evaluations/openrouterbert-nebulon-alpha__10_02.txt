**1.0**

The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting the minimum score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Roles/Columns**: Missing "Operations Manager" column (present in ground truth with consistent accountability assignments). Uses only 3 columns vs. ground truth's 4.
- **Tasks**: 8 tasks vs. ground truth's 6. Introduces unsubstantiated extras ("Ensures the SWIFT message is sent", "Notifies the Regulatory Liaison of completion"). Task phrasings differ significantly (e.g., "Receives and logs the customer’s transfer instruction in the system" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Performs the KYC Review..." vs. "**KYC Review**").
- **RACI Assignments**: No row matches ground truth exactly. All assignments differ (e.g., KYC Review: LLM has only R for Regulatory Liaison vs. ground truth C/TA, R/RL, A/OM, I/IT; similar mismatches everywhere).
- **Formatting**: No bolding on R/A/C/I (ground truth uses **R** etc.). No legend. Blank cells unformatted (ground truth uses explicit entries). No post-table notes or "mandated wording" header phrasing.
- **Coverage/Fidelity**: While mandated vocabulary (KYC Review, Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison) is used correctly, the table fails to mirror ground truth's exact structure, mappings, and distributions, introducing inventions and omissions relative to the benchmark.

These are not minor discrepancies but wholesale structural, content, and assignment failures.
