9.0

The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth. It correctly lists the two sets of tasks that can execute concurrently, preserving the correct order, grouping, and naming. The answer is concise and contains only the information required by the prompt.

There are, however, two minor omissions that justify a one-point deduction due to the maximal strictness requested:
- The LLM answer does not explicitly label the sets as "first parallel block" and "second parallel block" (as in the ground truth).
- The LLM answer omits the sentence "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel," though this was not strictly required by the prompt.

Overall, the answer is accurate and faithful, but given the rubric of "also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points," these minor issues lead to a score of 9.0.
