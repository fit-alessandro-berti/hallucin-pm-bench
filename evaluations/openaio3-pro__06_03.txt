The LLM answer correctly identifies the two sets of concurrent tasks from Process B's parallel constructs, matching the core content of the ground truth without extraneous information. However, it loses points for minor formatting differences: using commas instead of the ‖ symbol to denote parallelism, lacking descriptive headers (e.g., "**Set 1 – first parallel block:**"), no backticks around task names, and omitting the closing sentence about no other parallel tasks—resulting in a less precise stylistic match under strict evaluation criteria.
