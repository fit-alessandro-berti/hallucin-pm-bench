The LLM answer correctly determines "Non-compliant" and identifies the exact two violating rules (2 and 3) with accurate descriptions of the violations, matching the ground truth's key reasons for non-compliance. Format aligns with the prompt (status + numbered justifications citing rules). Minor deductions for: (1) small numerical error in Rule 3 distance (4 vs. ground truth's 3, though violation correctly identified); (2) lack of comprehensive check/explanation for all 5 rules (ground truth explicitly confirms Rules 1, 4, 5 satisfied, providing fuller audit); (3) slightly less verbose phrasing without overall summary recap. Semantically strong but not identical, warranting strict deduction per criteria.
