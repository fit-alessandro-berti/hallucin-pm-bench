1.0

The LLM answer is an incomplete, malformed JSON (truncates mid-array, invalid syntax), uses an entirely different schema/structure (full bpmn-js BPMN 2.0 with lanes, messages, laneSets, etc.) versus the ground truth's custom simplified "elements"/"flows" format, introduces extras like lanes/pools not present in ground truth (hallucination penalty), incompletely models flows/elements (e.g., no full process definition, missing key nodes like resolution fork/join, timer/reply logic, cancel handling), and fails to faithfully replicate the exact element IDs/names/flows/conditions. No matching content justifies any higher score under strict criteria.
