The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists the two sets of concurrent tasks in the exact order they appear, matching the semantic content of the ground truth without extraneous information about other processes. Minor deductions for formatting differences (e.g., use of curly braces and commas instead of backticks and â€– symbol; lack of descriptive labels like "first parallel block" and the closing sentence), which deviate from the ground truth's presentation under strict evaluation criteria.
