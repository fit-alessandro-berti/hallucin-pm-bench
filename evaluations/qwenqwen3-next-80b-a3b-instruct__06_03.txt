The LLM answer is factually correct: it identifies both sets of concurrent tasks in Process B, numbers them in order, and includes only information about Process B. The separation of concurrent tasks in curly braces is clear and unambiguous.

However, points are deducted for the following minor differences:

- The ground truth includes a short description for each set, labeling the parallel block ("first parallel block", "second parallel block"). The LLM answer omits this explanatory parenthetical.
- The ground truth uses a slightly different formatting style (`â€–` between task names instead of a comma, and backticks around task names). The LLM answer instead just lists the task names separated by commas and uses curly braces.
- The ground truth also adds an explicit note: "No other tasks in Process B can run in parallel." The LLM answer omits this (though the prompt does not strictly require it).

While these are mostly stylistic and minor missing clarifications, they represent small but real differences from the ground truth, which according to strict criteria merit a non-perfect score.
