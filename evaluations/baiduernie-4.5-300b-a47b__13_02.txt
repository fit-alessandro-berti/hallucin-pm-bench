**9.7**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect:

1. **Count (Q1):** Correctâ€”states that "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs once, specifying the case (C05).
2. **Percentages (Q2a, Q2b):** Calculations are correct to two decimal places, match the ground truth exactly.
3. **Short explanation (Q3):** Meets all three criteria:
   - Notes the "1 occurrence."
   - Explains the risk of overfitting/statistical instability due to rare data.
   - Explicitly warns about generalisation and misguiding model insight.
   
**Minor issue:**  
The explanation could have more explicitly mentioned instability in statistics (like averages or variances), and the phrase "overfitting to noise," while reasonable, is slightly less specific in the statistical sense than "wide confidence intervals" or "skewed averages." It's still solid and concise and covers all core points, but lacks the depth of the model answer.

**Hence, only a small deduction: 9.7.**
