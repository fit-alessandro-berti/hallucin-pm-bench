The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Questions 1 and 2 match the ground truth exactly, including calculations and rounding. For question 3, the response (78 words) addresses the required elements: it explicitly notes the single occurrence, highlights risks of instability (e.g., overfitting to noise, undue importance), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., not statistically representative, unreliable insights), aligning with the ground truth criteria without invention or excess.
