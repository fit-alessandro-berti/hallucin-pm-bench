### Evaluation Breakdown

#### Part (a): Summary of Decision Points
The LLM answer fails to strictly adhere to the prompt by not clearly identifying and summarizing *every* decision point (gate or conditional branch) as discrete items with one-sentence rules each. Instead, it provides a narrative overview of the process steps, incorrectly framing non-decision elements (e.g., receiving Form 14B, assigning the Deck Officer, performing the Tri-Color-Risk-Check) as bullet points, which dilutes focus and introduces inaccuracies. 

- It vaguely captures the risk-based skip (first ground truth point) but buries it in a run-on structure: "If risk is Low or Medium and requested loan amount ≤ €250,000, the process skips further review." This matches the rule but lacks the precise phrasing and context (e.g., "bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise it proceeds to that review").
- It partially captures the TriVote gate (second ground truth point) with "requiring at least two out of three approvals," which aligns with the rule ("any two approvals out of three suffice"), but incorrectly ties it to the Manual-Underwriting-Review as "producing a Decisional TriVote" (the process separates them: step 5 is review producing Deck Memo, then step 6 is TriVote). 
- Additional errors: Mentions finalizing Loan Dossier 2025 "upon TriVote approval, including the Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration," which conflates steps 7–9 (TriVote leads to preparing Offer Sheet, then confirmation, then finalization). The applicant confirmation (step 8) is not a decision point but is listed as one ("Finally, the applicant confirms... to close"). No mention of the "all three" roles being mandatory participants.
- Overall: Misses the "one sentence each" format, adds extraneous non-decision content, and introduces step-sequence errors. This is a significant deviation from the ground truth's concise, numbered list of exactly two decision points. Strict deduction for incompleteness and structural inaccuracy: ~3/10.

#### Part (b): List of All Required Documents
The LLM answer drastically underperforms by listing only 3 documents in order of first appearance, omitting 6 out of the 9 ground truth items. It ignores key documents integral to the process:

- Misses Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow (explicit inputs/documents for step 3's Tri-Color-Risk-Check).
- Misses Deck Memo (produced in step 5's Manual-Underwriting-Review).
- Misses Signed Offer Sheet 77 (distinct from unsigned Offer Sheet 77; required in step 8).
- Misses Loan Dossier 2025 (produced in step 9's Finalize-Agreement).

The listed items (Form 14B at step 1, Offer Sheet 77 at step 7, ID Matrix Declaration at step 8) are correct in sequence but incomplete. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML inventions), but the omissions alone represent a failure to "list **all** documents... in the order they first appear," per the prompt and ground truth. Strict deduction for major incompleteness: ~1/10.

#### Overall Score Rationale
Averaging the parts (weighted equally), the response shows partial grasp of core rules but is undermined by narrative fluff, step conflations, and egregious omissions in (b), violating the prompt's precision requirements. Under utmost strictness, even minor formatting/structural issues compound with content gaps for a low score; no partial credit for "no hallucinations" as the core task is unmet.
