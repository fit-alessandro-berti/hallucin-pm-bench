The LLM answer is fully accurate and aligns precisely with the ground truth. Question 1 is correct (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match the calculations and rounding exactly (2.08% and 8.33%). For question 3, the explanation is concise (78 words), highlights the single-occurrence issue, discusses instability (e.g., skewing averages and associations), and warns against over-generalization (e.g., non-representative path), fulfilling all required elements without invention or deviation from the log.
