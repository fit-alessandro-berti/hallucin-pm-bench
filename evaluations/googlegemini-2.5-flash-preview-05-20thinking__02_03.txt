- The LLM answer is fully correct in substance (all answers match the ground truth), but is missing the explicit enumeration of the distinct cases for Question 1 ("C123, C456, C789"), which is shown in the ground truth. Consistent with the stated grading policy, this omission (even if minor) results in a significant deduction.
