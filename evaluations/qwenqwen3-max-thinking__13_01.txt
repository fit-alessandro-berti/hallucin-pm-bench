**10.0**

The LLM answer is an exact match to the ground truth in content, accuracy, and adherence to the log data:
- Q1: Identical (1 occurrence).
- Q2: Identical calculation and result (5.56%).
- Q3: Correctly identifies the sole case (A1002); phrasing is equivalent ("the case identifier that contains" lists it precisely, matching "Only case A1002").
- Q4: Provides exactly two clear, sampling-related reasons directly matching two ground truth examples ("Small sample size" with equivalent detail on insufficiency; "Temporal bias" / "Limited time window" with equivalent focus on single-day coverage and variability). No hallucinations, inferences, or deviations. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., formatting, "≈") are stylistic and do not alter meaning.
