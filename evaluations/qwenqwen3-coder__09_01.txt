The LLM answer fully matches the ground truth response. It explicitly states that the requested value cannot be derived, cites the absence of timestamp/duration data as the core reason, and provides additional clarity regarding why the historical benchmark is not applicable, as well as what would be needed to compute the value. No significant or minor errors are present; the answer is complete, precise, and strictly aligns with the instructions and ground truth.
