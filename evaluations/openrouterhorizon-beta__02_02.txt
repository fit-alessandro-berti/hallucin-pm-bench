The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, structure, and ordering: A1 is correct (3 distinct cases); A2 lists the precise sequence for C002; A3 identifies the two distinct predecessors ("Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock") without duplication, listed one per line and alphabetically ordered. No hallucinations, omissions, or errors in activity names, sequencing, or formatting as required by the prompt.
