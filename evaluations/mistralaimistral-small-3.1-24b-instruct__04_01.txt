### Evaluation Rationale
- **Overall Correctness (High Weight)**: The LLM correctly concludes "Non-compliant," matching the ground truth. It identifies two actual violations (Rules 2 and 3), which are central to non-compliance. However, it fabricates a third violation (Intern directly following CFO under "Rule 5"), which is factually incorrect—event #7 (Intern) follows #6 (Warehouse_Clerk), not #3 (CFO), with events #4–#6 intervening. This invention significantly undermines accuracy, as Rule 4 (the actual Intern-CFO rule) is satisfied per ground truth.
  
- **Rule Coverage and Justification Quality**: Ground truth systematically evaluates all 5 rules (1–5), clearly stating satisfied/violated with precise event citations. LLM only addresses 3 "rules" but mislabels them: the Intern claim is wrongly assigned to Rule 5 (which is actually about ending with `Archive_Record`, satisfied here) instead of Rule 4; it ignores Rule 1 (approvals, satisfied) and doesn't confirm Rule 5. Justifications are numbered but lack the exhaustive, rule-by-rule structure of ground truth, leading to incomplete analysis.

- **Factual Errors and Precision (Strict Deduction)**: 
  - Rule 2 justification is mostly accurate (correctly notes `Risk_Assessment` after `Ship_Goods`), but phrasing is slightly off ("after the first occurrence" is redundant since there's only one).
  - Rule 3: Major counting error—claims "5th position after" (#6 to #10), but it's actually the 4th activity after (#7=1st, #8=2nd, #9=3rd, #10=4th); ground truth specifies "distance=3" (exceeding ≤2). This imprecise math reflects sloppy analysis.
  - No mention of optional `Quality_Check` under Rule 2 (trace skips it post-`Expedite_Flag`, which is allowed but unnoted).
  - Small format issues: Bolded rule headers are fine, but lacks ground truth's comprehensive numbering (e.g., no explicit "Rule X — Satisfied").

- **Strictness Applied**: Even minor issues (e.g., rule misnumbering, distance miscount) deduct heavily, as instructed. The fabricated violation is a critical error equivalent to ~2-3 points off alone. Score reflects partial credit for correct conclusion and partial violation spotting, but heavy penalties for inaccuracies and incompleteness (vs. ground truth's thorough, error-free breakdown). A perfect match would be 10.0; this is ~45% aligned due to flaws.
