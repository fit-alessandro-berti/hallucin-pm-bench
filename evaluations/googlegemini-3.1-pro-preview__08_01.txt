The LLM answer is highly accurate, correct, and fully responsive to the prompt: it affirms possibility ("Yes"), provides a minimal concrete firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T5) demonstrating T5 fires before T3 (T3 unfired), and offers a brief, step-by-step justification with precise markings and inhibitor arc explanation. No factual errors, safe net semantics respected perfectly.

Strict deductions (-0.6 total) for differences from ground truth:
- Phrasing: Lacks the "must fire before T3 if it occurs" insight (-0.2; extra analysis in GT).
- Sequence: Shorter (stops at T5 vs. GT's extension to T3/T4; sufficient but less illustrative) (-0.2).
- Justification: More concise, omits GT's bullet-point depth on permanent disablement and p4 emptying (-0.1); minor structural variance (integrated steps vs. separate sections) (-0.1).

LLM superior in avoiding GT's sequence error (T4 impossible after T5→T3 due to p3=0). Overall, excellent match on core requirements with minor omissions in elaboration.
