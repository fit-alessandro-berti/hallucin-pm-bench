a) The LLM answer correctly identifies both key decision points (the risk-based skip and the TriVote approval), states the conditions appropriately, and summarizes their rules with decent accuracy. However, in the first decision point, it omits the explicit “otherwise proceeds to that review” clause (though this is implicit), and in the second point, while it says “any two approvals out of the three suffice to pass”, it could more explicitly state the at-least-two-to-advance rule (the ground truth wording is superior).

b) In the list of required documents, the LLM omits “Signed Offer Sheet 77”, which is a distinct document required for applicant confirmation (not just “Offer Sheet 77”). This is a notable omission because “Signed” indicates a necessary transformation in the process, and its absence demonstrates an incomplete list. Otherwise, all other documents are listed in the correct order and are correctly named.

Strictly speaking, the omission of “Signed Offer Sheet 77” and the slight imprecision in decision-point phrasing are significant enough, by your instructions, to warrant a deduction of about three points from an otherwise solid answer.
