**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict scoring):
- **Correct overall verdict (Non-compliant)**: +1.0 (matches ground truth binary).
- **Major errors in justification** (-8.0 total penalty):
  - **Rule 2 misinterpretation** (-4.0): LLM incorrectly states Rule 2 *requires* `Quality_Check` before `Ship_Goods` (exact opposite: Rule 2 makes `Quality_Check` *optional* with `Expedite_Flag`, and mandates `Risk_Assessment` before `Ship_Goods`). Fails to identify actual violation (`Risk_Assessment` at #9 *after* `Ship_Goods` at #8).
  - **Factual trace error** (-2.0): Misidentifies #7 as `Quality_Check` (actual: `Move_to_Quality`); no `Quality_Check` exists in trace.
  - **Misses Rule 3 violation** (-1.0): Ground truth flags `Three_way_match` at #10 (distance=3/4 > ≤2 after #6); LLM ignores entirely.
  - **Incomplete rule coverage** (-1.0): Ground truth systematically checks *all 5 rules*; LLM skips Rules 1, 3, 5 (only partial on 2 & 4).
- No credit for Rule 4 mention (correct but superficial; ground truth is more precise).
- Strictness applied: Small errors (e.g., activity name) compounded by core misreading = outsized penalty; justification diverges substantially from ground truth's accuracy/completeness.
