8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely aligns with the core requirements of the prompt by identifying the correct three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, accurately quantifying excesses (+300s for Legal and Risk, +60s for Credit), and providing one concrete action per activity in bullet points only. It grounds all statements in the table data (e.g., throughput times, waiting times, SLAs) without inventing metrics, activities, or unrelated details, and adheres to the ~150-word limit while returning only memo text.

However, under utmost strictness, significant deductions are warranted for the following differences from the ground truth (resulting in a non-perfect score):
- **Structure and formatting (major deduction: -1.0)**: Lacks a formal memo header (e.g., To/From/Subject), which the ground truth includes for executive polish. The LLM uses a simple bold title and inline descriptions, while the ground truth employs concise, bulleted-style activity summaries.
- **Order of activities (minor deduction: -0.5)**: Presents Risk Review first instead of Legal Approval (which has the highest joint breach/wait metrics), diverging from the ground truth's logical prioritization by severity.
- **Recommendations (moderate deduction: -0.5)**: Actions are concrete and tied to data (e.g., addressing high waits via balancing or standardization), but less specific/data-driven than the ground truth's tailored suggestions (e.g., referencing risk levels, peak times, or loan thresholds). The LLM's are more generic, missing the ground truth's implied projections or broader impact statements.
- **Overall completeness and tone (minor deduction: -0.0 additional, as balanced)**: No extraneous inventions, but omits the ground truth's closing projection (e.g., 35% cycle time reduction), which adds executive value without violating rules.

Total differences reflect strong fidelity to the prompt but subtle lapses in professional framing and recommendation depth, justifying an 8.0.
