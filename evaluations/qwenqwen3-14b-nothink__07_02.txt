### Evaluation Reasoning
The LLM answer captures the core changes (three added tasks, one removed task, and the gateway type change) but introduces significant deviations from the ground truth and the prompt's strict requirements. These errors include extraneous and misplaced information, which violates the instruction to summarize changes *strictly* under the headings and ignore cosmetic renamings. Below is a breakdown:

- **Added tasks**: Correctly identifies the three new tasks (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject). However, it incorrectly appends a note about Task_ApproveLoan being renamed, which is irrelevant here (it's neither added nor a task change—it's cosmetic and should be ignored entirely). This adds unnecessary noise under the heading, reducing accuracy.

- **Removed tasks**: Correctly identifies Task_RejectLoan as removed but erroneously includes Task_ApproveLoan (stating it "was not removed"), which misplaces it under this heading and confuses the summary. Additionally, the phrase "replaced by Task_FinalReject" implies an unrequested interpretation (replacement is not equivalent to separate addition/removal; the prompt demands strict categorization without such commentary).

- **Gateway-type changes**: Correctly notes the type change from exclusive to inclusive. However, it adds an irrelevant note about the gateway's name change ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check"), which the prompt explicitly instructs to ignore. This extraneous detail dilutes the focus.

Overall, while the essential facts are present, the additions of irrelevant/cosmetic details and incorrect placements under headings introduce distortions that prevent a clean, strict match to the ground truth. No other changes (e.g., flow additions) are mentioned, which aligns, but the strictness criterion demands near-perfect adherence—resulting in a mid-range score with deductions for each infraction (approximately -1.0 to -2.0 per heading error). Structure (bullets vs. numbering) is a minor cosmetic difference but contributes to non-exactness.
