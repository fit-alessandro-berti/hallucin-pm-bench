• The LLM answer gives all true changes and makes clear distinctions, but loses points for:
  - Slight redundancy (repeat mention of the “rename” of `Task_ApproveLoan` under both “Added” and “Removed” tasks, even though it correctly recognizes that it is not a true addition or removal and that the name change is cosmetic).
  - While the answer notes that the name change for the gateway is cosmetic, it still lists it under gateway-type changes (it should have omitted this entirely, per instructions).
  - Over-verbalization slightly detracts from strictness/conciseness.
  - *No incorrect changes are listed*, but these small procedural lapses mean a strict evaluation cannot give full marks.
