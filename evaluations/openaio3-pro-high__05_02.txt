The LLM answer correctly identifies and implements the exact same XML modification (changing the `camunda:dueDate` from "P5D" to "P2D" for the `Task_CollectEquipment`), adheres to the rules by modifying only an existing attribute without adding/deleting elements or altering flows, and follows the required output structure with a single-hunk diff and a one-sentence rationale. However, it loses points for minor format issues in the diff (unnecessary and inaccurate file name headers like "OnboardingProcess.bpmn," which are not present in the provided XML, and an incomplete @@ line reference) and for rationale wording that diverges from the ground truth (e.g., "equipment-pickup deadline" and "biggest bottleneck" instead of precise phrasing like "Collect Equipment due-date" and "contractual 3-day SLA," with generic SLA reference rather than the specific 3-day detail, introducing unsubstantiated claims).
