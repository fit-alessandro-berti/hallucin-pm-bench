The LLM answer correctly identifies the possibility ("Yes"), provides a minimal but sufficient firing sequence (T1, T2, T5) that demonstrates T5 firing before T3 in a reachable marking, and offers a brief, accurate justification aligned with the prompt's requirements. Markings are precisely described without errors. It closely matches the ground truth's core content (affirmation, sequence up to T5, enabling conditions via inhibitor arc) but omits the deeper "must" necessity explanation and the extended (but factually erroneous) sequence including T3 and impossible T4 firing, resulting in minor differences in depth and completeness. Under strict evaluation, this lack of full alignment deducts a small amount, but no factual errors in the LLM answer prevent a high score.
