**3.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
The LLM answer shows partial compliance but has **numerous significant differences** from the ground truth, warranting a low score under utmost strictness (small errors = major point loss; cumulative diffs amplify deduction). Breakdown:

#### **Major Structural Differences (-3.0 points base)**:
- **Table format/orientation**: LLM uses non-standard "Task | R | A | C | I" with **role names or "—" in cells**. Ground truth uses standard RACI format "Task | Role1 | Role2 | Role3 | Role4" with **single letters (R/A/C/I, bolded for R/A)**. This is a core mismatch in RACI presentation.
- **No legend**: Ground truth has explicit "**Legend** R = Responsible...". LLM omits, reducing clarity.
- **Header mismatch**: LLM "Task" vs. ground truth "**Task / Activity (mandated wording)**".
- **Empties**: LLM uses "—" vs. ground truth's explicit letters or blanks.

#### **Role Differences (-1.5 points)**:
- Missing **Operations Manager** entirely (ground truth's primary Accountable role across all tasks).
- LLM sticks to source roles (TA, RL, IT Support) – correct per source/prompt but deviates from ground truth.

#### **Task Coverage & Wording Differences (-1.5 points)**:
- **Extra/ split tasks** (omissions/substitutions penalized): LLM adds "Notify Regulatory Liaison of completed transaction" (duplicative, "completed" not in source) and separates "Ensure SWIFT message is sent" (logical but not in ground truth, which folds into "Release Payment"?). Ground truth has exactly 6 concise tasks.
- Wording variances (not "mandated wording" exact):
  | LLM Task | Ground Truth Task | Diff |
  |----------|-------------------|------|
  | Receive and log transfer instruction | Receive Payment Instruction | Extra details ("log", "transfer") |
  | Screen payment against sanctions list | Screen Against Sanctions List | Minor phrasing/capitalization |
  | Perform KYC Review on sender and beneficiary | **KYC Review** | Extra "Perform...sender and beneficiary" |
  | Approve high-risk transaction | Approve High-Risk Transactions | Minor plural/capitalization |
  | Release payment after approval | Release Payment | Extra "after approval" |
  | Ensure SWIFT message is sent | *(Missing explicit task)* | LLM covers source but adds |
  | Archive case file | Archive Record | "case file" vs. "Record" |
  | Notify... | *(Folded into Archive I)* | Unnecessary split |
- No bolding on "**KYC Review**" as in ground truth.

#### **RACI Assignments (Completely Divergent: -2.0 points)**:
No task matches ground truth exactly. Examples:
| Task (approx.) | LLM | Ground Truth | Mismatch |
|----------------|-----|--------------|----------|
| Receive | TA (R,A) | TA **R**, RL I, OM **A**, IT C | No OM **A**, wrong C/I |
| Screen | TA (R,A), RL C | TA **R**, RL **A**, OM I, IT C | Wrong A/C |
| KYC Review | RL (R,A), TA C | TA C, RL **R**, OM **A**, IT I | Wrong A/C/I, no OM |
| Approve | RL (R,A), TA I | TA C, RL **R**, OM **A**, IT I | Wrong C/I |
| Release | TA (R,A) | TA **R**, RL I, OM **A**, IT C | Wrong A/C/I |
| Archive | IT (R,A), RL I | TA C, RL I, OM **A**, IT **R** | Wrong A/C |
- LLM over-relies on doer as R**and**A (unrealistic; ignores hierarchy). Wrong inferences (e.g., TA consulted for KYC? No source basis; IT only "consulted" for SWIFT it *ensures*).

#### **Strengths (Minimal Credit: +1.5 points)**:
- Markdown table.
- Strictly uses mandated vocabulary (KYC Review, Regulatory Liaison, Transaction Analyst) – no forbidden terms.
- Covers *all source tasks* without omissions (even if split).
- No criminal/policy violations.

**Total: Starts at 10.0, deducts ~8.0 for diffs → 3.0**. LLM is a functional RACI but fails fidelity to ground truth format, roles, assignments, and exactness.
