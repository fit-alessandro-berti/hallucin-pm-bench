The LLM answer is fully accurate and complete. Question 1 matches exactly (1 occurrence). Question 2a and 2b match the deterministic calculations precisely (2.08% and 8.33%, rounded to two decimals). Question 3 adheres to the â‰¤100-word limit (68 words), explicitly addresses the single occurrence ("only once"), highlights instability via lack of variance ("no variance in timing or context"), and cautions against over-generalization (e.g., skewing durations, biasing models, ignoring variant impacts), aligning closely with ground truth criteria without invention or deviation.
