9.0

1. The answer correctly identifies the count (1).
2. Both percentages (2.08% for events, 8.33% for cases) are exactly correct to two decimal places.
3. The explanation in (3) is concise, notes the single occurrence ("occurs only once"), mentions lack of variance/instability ("no variance in timing or context"), and warns about misleading generalization. However, it could be stronger by explicitly stating that any statistic is based on a single observation and thus highly unstable; it does mention "skew average durations" and "bias predictive models," but does not reference the instability/confidence issue as directly as in the ground truth.

Minor shortfall in the nuance of (3) keeps it from a perfect 10, but all essential elements are present and the quantitative answers are flawless.
