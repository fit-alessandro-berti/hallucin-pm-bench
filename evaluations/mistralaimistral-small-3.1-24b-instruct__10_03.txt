2.5  
The LLM answer correctly uses the four mandated terms (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) without synonyms leaking, which avoids a total failure on vocabulary policy. However, it fails severely on multiple fronts with strict deduction: (1) Incorrect activity names for additional steps—e.g., "**Approval**" instead of "**Compliance Officer Approval**", "**Fund Transfer**" instead of "**Release Funds**", and adds an unauthorized "**Notification**" row (merging or adding prohibited); this alone warrants major loss as it violates "do not rename, merge, or add activities." (2) RACI assignments are largely inaccurate or incomplete—e.g., Intake Vetting omits A for Front-Office Analyst, C for Compliance Analyst, I for Treasury Ops; KYC Review and AML Screening miss A for Compliance Analyst, C for Compliance Officer, I for Treasury Ops; Risk Scoring wrongly assigns only R to Compliance Analyst, C to Compliance Officer, I to Treasury Ops (vs. ground truth's C for Front-Office Analyst, R for Compliance Analyst, A for Compliance Officer, I for Treasury Ops); invented rows compound errors. (3) Format deviations—full words ("Responsible") instead of abbreviations (R, A, C, I); blanks instead of dashes (–) for no involvement; inconsistent bolding; extra explanatory text post-table (not in ground truth or authorized). These cumulative differences (even small formatting ones) result in low fidelity to the ground truth, justifying a minimal score above 1.0 only for partial vocabulary adherence.
