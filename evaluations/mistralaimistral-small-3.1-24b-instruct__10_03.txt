4.0

- Vocabulary: The LLM answer correctly uses only the authorized vocabulary for the four activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring) and does not leak synonyms in the activity names. This is a major compliance point.
- Activities: The matrix introduces activities that are either renamed (e.g. "Approval", "Fund Transfer", "Notification") or merged, which was prohibited: it did not retain the activity names or granularity from the process narrative or ground truth. For example:
  - “Intake Vetting” is present (good).
  - "KYC Review" is present (good).
  - "AML Screening" is present (good).
  - "Risk Scoring" is present (good).
  - But instead of "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds", it lists "**Approval**" and "**Fund Transfer**", and "Notification" for the final step. These are not exact matches.
- Role Assignments:  
  - The RACI assignments are incorrect or incomplete:
    - The ground truth often has dual roles (e.g., R,A for both Responsible and Accountable on the same activity), which is not reflected.
    - "Consulted" and "Informed" assignments are missing or wrong for most activities relative to the ground truth.
    - Specifically, "Risk Scoring" lists Compliance Officer as “Consulted”, but in ground truth they are “A” (Accountable).
    - "Notification" step is not present in ground truth as an explicit line item.
    - "Fund Transfer" is not the same as "Release Funds", but more importantly, the RACIs don't match ground truth at all.
    - "Approval" does not specify which officer/role—should be "Compliance Officer Approval".
    - Consulted and Informed are misassigned in almost all activities.
- Format issues: RACI keys are not bolded or comma-delimited as in ground truth. Dashes (–) were required for no involvement, but are missing.

Summary:
- While the vocabulary is strictly adhered to for the four terms (avoiding synonyms), the matrix's activity names and structure depart significantly from the process steps and RACI assignments in the ground truth. The roles and involvement are not as granular or correct.
- For the introduction of unauthorized activity names, loss of structure, and major RACI assignment mismatches, the output loses substantial credit and should not score higher than 4.0.
