9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the three worst activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents #1, Send_Closure_Letter #2, Assess_Liability #3), quotes the exact average and 95th-percentile waiting times verbatim, and stays within 150 words (149). It avoids all prohibited content (no service times, throughput, or other activities). Actions are concrete and logically tied to waiting-time bottlenecks, with an explicit aim for ≥20% reduction, but they are slightly less "data-driven" than the ground truth's (lacking specific pilots, estimates, or targets like "≥25%" or "30%"). The added memo formatting and closing sentences provide polish without violation, but introduce minor extraneous content. Strict deduction for action specificity reduces from a perfect score.
