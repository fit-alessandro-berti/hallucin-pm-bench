**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (50% weight)**: Perfect match (count=1, exact string verified). Minor deduction for unasked Python code (adds ~20 lines irrelevant to prompt). **9.5/10**
- **Q2 (50% weight)**: Major deviations from ground truth. Fails to address core issues: tiny sample (14 events/3 cases/<2hrs), rare-event sampling volatility (0-7% swing, wide CI), fraud-check near-synonyms (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), need for larger/random sample. Instead, speculates unsupported analyst errors (grouping “Manual Review”—occurs equally once; “smooth paths”/“unnecessary” inference violates "no speculation"). Factual error: claims “Manual Fraud Check” less frequent than “Manual Review” (both 1x). Word count OK (92), but content ~80% mismatch. **-2.5/10**

Strict holistic score reflects "utmost strictness": correct count saves it from <3.0, but Q2 errors/omissions/speculation dominate.
