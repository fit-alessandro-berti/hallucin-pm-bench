2.0

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Vocabulary Compliance (Perfect, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" with exact spelling and capitalization. No forbidden terms ("Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear anywhere.
- **Structure and Content Basics (Partial, +1.0 point)**: Activities match the process steps without extras. Roles are correctly listed as columns. Markdown table format is used, though the ground truth has minor formatting differences (e.g., **R / A** vs. **R, A**; this is a small inconsistency but deducts slightly under strictness).
- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, -1.0 point adjustment from base)**: This is the core failure. The narrative implies primary handlers as Responsible (R), with Account Manager (AM) as Accountable (A) where appropriate, one R per activity, and inferred Consulted (C)/Informed (I) roles. The LLM answer has:
  - Multiple activities with wrong A (e.g., Compliance Officer as A for KYC Review instead of AM; Finance Clerk as A for Payment Clearance instead of AM; IT Support as A for Record Update, where none is explicitly A but AM should be appropriate per notes).
  - Missing or incorrect C/I: No use of "I" (Informed) at all—uses "—" which ignores distinctions (e.g., Receive Application misses CO C, FC I, IT I; KYC Review misses FC C; Payment Clearance misses CO C; Record Update misses FC C; Notify Customer incorrectly adds IT C instead of I).
  - Only ~40% alignment with ground truth assignments (e.g., correct R/A on Order Vetting and Notify Customer partially; full misses elsewhere). Each mismatch is a significant error per strict rubric, leading to heavy deduction.
- **Unwarranted Content (Minor Deduction, -0.5 points)**: Adds a title ("# Order-to-Cash RACI Matrix") and explanatory "Key" section, which introduces extra elements not in the ground truth or prompt. No new tasks/roles, but this violates "no extra" strictly.
- **Overall Strictness**: With ~60% deviation in core RACI logic (the prompt's main deliverable), plus format/involvement gaps, the score reflects severe inaccuracies despite vocabulary adherence. Small errors (e.g., no I, extra key) compound to significant loss. Total base adjusted to 2.0.
