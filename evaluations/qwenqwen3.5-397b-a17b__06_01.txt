The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B (ignoring A), lists them in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall, with Create_Documentation... preceding Procure_Materials...), uses one pair per line, and follows the specified format with spaces around " — ". No extraneous pairs or content. The only differences are minor whitespace variations in the second pair (lacking the precise padding spaces for column alignment present in the ground truth), which under utmost strictness warrants a 1-point deduction despite perfect semantic accuracy.
