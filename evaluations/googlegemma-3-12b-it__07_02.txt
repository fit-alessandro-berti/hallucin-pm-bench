### Evaluation Rationale
- **Added tasks**: Partial match (3 out of 4 items correct: `Task_VerifyIdentity`, `Task_RequestDocs`, `Task_FinalReject`). However, incorrectly includes `Task_ApproveLoan` as "added" despite it existing in v1 (only a name change, which must be ignored per prompt). This is a major factual error, misclassifying an existing task and violating the "strictly" ignore renamings rule. Significant deduction.
- **Removed tasks**: Exact match (only `Task_RejectLoan`). No issues.
- **Gateway-type changes**: Partial match for the core change (exclusiveGateway → inclusiveGateway, akin to Exclusive → Inclusive). However, erroneously includes the gateway's name change ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check"), which is a cosmetic renaming explicitly to be ignored and does not fit "Gateway-type changes" (e.g., the prompt's example focuses on type like Exclusive → Inclusive). This pollutes the section with irrelevant content. Significant deduction for specificity violation.
- **Overall**: The response follows the headings and structure but introduces clear inaccuracies and extraneous details, deviating from the ground truth's precise, minimal summary. Under utmost strictness, these errors (misclassification and inclusion of ignored elements) warrant a middling score despite some alignment. No other unmentioned changes (e.g., flows) are appropriately omitted by both.
