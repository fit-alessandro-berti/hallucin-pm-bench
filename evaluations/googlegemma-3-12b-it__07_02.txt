6.0

**Rationale:**

- **Added tasks:**  
  - Correctly identifies the three genuinely new tasks.
  - **Error:** Incorrectly lists `Task_ApproveLoan` (with a name change to "Auto-Approve Loan") as an added task. This is not an addition—it is a cosmetic renaming, which was explicitly told to be ignored.

- **Removed tasks:**  
  - Correctly identifies only `Task_RejectLoan` as removed.

- **Gateway-type changes:**  
  - Correctly identifies the change from `exclusiveGateway` to `inclusiveGateway`.
  - **Minor issue:** Mentions the gateway's *name* change ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check"). Cosmetic renaming was to be explicitly ignored.

**Penalties:**
- Listing a non-added task under "Added tasks" is a significant error (-2).
- Mentioning a purely cosmetic name change as a gateway-type change (when instructed to ignore such) is a notable but less severe error (-1).
- All truly structural changes are correctly identified, no missing items. No misattribution of removals.

**Conclusion:**  
The answer demonstrates general understanding but makes two notable mistakes (one major, one mild), resulting in a **6.0**.
