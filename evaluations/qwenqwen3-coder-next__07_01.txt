7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies all factual differences (added tasks: `check_vip`, `generate_qr`; removed: `send_rma_label`; gateway change on `gw_valid` from exclusive to inclusive). No extra or missing items, adhering to the prompt's categories.

However, strict evaluation against ground truth reveals significant differences:
- **Task listings**: Uses only IDs (e.g., `check_vip`) vs. full names + IDs (e.g., "Check Customer VIP Status (id = `check_vip`)"). Missing names is a notable omission (-1.0).
- **Gateway phrasing**: Concise "gw_valid: changed from exclusiveGateway to inclusiveGateway" vs. "`gw_valid` changed from **exclusiveGateway** (v1) to **inclusiveGateway** (v2)". Lacks backticks, bolding, and version labels (-0.5).
- **Formatting**: 
  - Headings use "• Added tasks" (matches prompt exactly) vs. "**Added tasks**" (no leading bullet).
  - Bullets: "–" with indentation vs. "*" without.
  - No final note "(No other differences should be reported.)" (-0.5 for style mismatches).
- No "(none)" needed, correctly omitted.

Semantically perfect (10.0 base), but textual/presentation diffs deduct 2.5 for utmost strictness on exact matching.
