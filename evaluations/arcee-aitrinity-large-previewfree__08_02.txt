**1.0**

The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect: Q1 wrongly claims "No" (ground truth: "Yes"), providing a flawed explanation that ignores the P1→P2 split enabling P4/P5 via T2-T7-T4 while P2 remains marked. Q2 wrongly dismisses with "Not applicable" instead of providing the required sequence (T1→T2→T7→T4→T5). No alignment with ground truth facts, markings, or reasoning; complete reversal of truth warrants minimum score.
