The LLM answer is extremely close to the ground truth answer. Only a very minor formatting inconsistency is found, specifically in the "GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES" section:

- The ground truth aligns the second gateway entry with extra spaces before "exclusive → parallel":  
  Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel

- The LLM answer removes those spaces, listing:  
  Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel

All the content is strictly correct: all and only the verifiable differences are listed, in the right structure and order. The difference in spacing, while very minor, is a formatting mismatch, so the score is docked accordingly given the request for "utmost strictness."
