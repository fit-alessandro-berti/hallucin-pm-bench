The LLM answer is functionally identical to the ground truth in content, structure, and adherence to instructions (correct added/removed tasks and gateway changes, using the specified format from the example without extras). The only difference is minor spacing for alignment in the ground truth's second gateway line, which is not required by the prompt's example and does not constitute an error warranting deduction under strict evaluation.
