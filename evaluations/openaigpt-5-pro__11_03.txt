### Evaluation Rationale
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as the worst-performing based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times. Quantification of SLA excesses is accurate (+300 s, +300 s, +60 s) and grounded in table data, including references to throughput, waiting times, and cases (which adds detail without invention). The use of bullet points exclusively for recommendations complies with instructions.
- **Major Weaknesses (significant deductions)**: 
  - **Structure and Format**: Lacks executive memo elements like "To/From/Subject" header, introduction referencing total cases (ground truth uses "4 805 completed cases," even if approximate), and closing projection (e.g., "reduce end-to-end cycle time by roughly 35 %"). Starts abruptly, resembling a fragment rather than a ~150-word memo (LLM is ~120 words, incomplete feel).
  - **Recommendations**: Completely different from ground truth—LLM's are generic (e.g., "priority queue," "dedicated windows," "prioritize intake") and loosely data-driven by tying reductions to exact waiting excesses, but lack the concrete, scenario-specific actions in ground truth (e.g., "rule-based pre-checks for bypass," "add one risk analyst," "straight-through heuristic for loans under €25k"). This is a core mismatch, as recommendations are a primary prompt requirement.
  - **Content Fidelity**: Omits bolding/formatting for activities, subject line details (e.g., "Loan-Origination (April 2025 sample)"), and holistic impact statement. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., LLM says "throughput 900 s vs 600 s SLA" vs. ground truth's "**900 s** vs. 600 s SLA") accumulate under strictness.
- **Overall**: High fidelity on identification/quantification (~70% match) but low on format, recommendations, and completeness (~30% match), yielding a mid-low score. Strict penalty for deviations, even if LLM avoids inventions better than ground truth in some areas.
