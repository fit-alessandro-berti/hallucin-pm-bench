### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Q1 (Distinct cases)**: The LLM correctly identifies "3" as the count, matching the core fact in the ground truth. However, under utmost strictness, it omits the explicit listing of cases (C123, C456, C789) provided in the ground truth, which adds verification detail. This is a minor omission but warrants a deduction for not fully aligning with the expected elaboration (e.g., -0.5 points from perfect).
- **Q2 (Activity preceding Ship_Order for C456)**: Exact match ("Pack_Items"), no deduction.
- **Q3 (Activity appearing exactly once)**: Exact match ("Cancel_Order"), no deduction.
- **Overall Format and Conciseness**: The LLM adheres to the prompt's "concise, bullet-point answers only" instruction effectively, with clear labeling. Minor deduction solely for Q1 completeness.
