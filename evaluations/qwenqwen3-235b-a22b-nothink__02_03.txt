9.5

- The LLM answer is virtually identical to the ground truth, correctly answering all three questions.
  - Q1: "3" (vs "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)") — The LLM omits explicitly listing the cases, which is a very minor omission, but it does technically leave out information contained in the ground truth.
  - Q2: "Pack_Items" — Correct.
  - Q3: "Cancel_Order" — Correct.
- The omission of the specific case IDs for question 1 is a slight deviation, so a small deduction is warranted per "utmost strictness." Otherwise, the answer is correct and concise.
- Final score: 9.5.
