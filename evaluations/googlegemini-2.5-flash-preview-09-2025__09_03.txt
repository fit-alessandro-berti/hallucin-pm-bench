The LLM answer is an excellent match to the ground truth, fully addressing the task's requirements with precise, non-speculative reasoning. It correctly identifies the data absence (no rows, no timestamps) as the barrier to all computations, structures the response to mirror the three-part task while providing a single explanatory paragraph as instructed, and avoids any external assumptions or tables. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "removed for privacy" vs. "redacted"; separate "cannot" statements vs. combined) do not constitute errors, as both maintain factual accuracy and brevity without introducing discrepancies.
