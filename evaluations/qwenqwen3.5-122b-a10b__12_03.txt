**9.0**

The LLM answer is factually correct, correctly identifies "No" with precise counterexamples (C002 and C004), cites exact CaseIDs, timestamps, and intervening activity sequences as required, and follows the prompt's exact 1./2. structure perfectly. It efficiently disproves "always" via relevant evidence.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for:
- Not exhaustively verifying all cases (omits C001/C003 confirmations, unlike ground truth's case-by-case table).
- Less structured presentation (plain text vs. ground truth's comprehensive table with all cases, successor column, notes, and quantification of violations).
- Slightly less meticulous completeness, per the "meticulous process-mining analyst" role, though sufficient for disproof.

No factual errors; high alignment in core content.
