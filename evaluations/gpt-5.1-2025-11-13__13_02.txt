10.0

The LLM answer is an exact match for questions 1 and 2, with precise counts and percentages rounded to two decimals as required. For question 3, the explanation (72 words) fully addresses the ground truth criteria: (i) single-occurrence issue ("single, rare... instance"), (ii) variance/instability ("no statistical basis... dominated by noise or idiosyncrasies"), and (iii) caution against over-generalisation ("wrongly treat... as typical, miscalibrate models, or overfit rules"). No inventions, adheres to log data only, and stays under 100 words. No errors or deviations.
