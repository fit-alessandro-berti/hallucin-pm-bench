- Q1: Exact match (1). Perfect.
- Q2a/b: Exact matches (2.08%, 8.33%), with correct calculations shown. Perfect.
- Q3: ≤100 words (73). Covers (i) single occurrence explicitly; (iii) cautions over-generalization (inaccurate representations/decisions). Implies (ii) instability via misrepresentation of "role, timing, or impact" in metrics/models, with relevant process-mining context (rare deviation, performance/predictive risks). Minor phrasing oddity ("falsely suggest...standard" – low count implies rarity, not standardcy; overlooks explicit variance/skew/CI). Strict deduction for imperfect (ii) explicitness and logic nit. Overall excellent fidelity.
