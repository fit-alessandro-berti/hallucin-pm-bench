The LLM answer matches the ground truth on R1, R3, R4, R5, and R6 statuses and justifications (minor phrasing differences, all â‰¤20 words). However, it incorrectly marks R2 as Compliant with flawed justification, missing the impact of the Change_Request requiring a later final approval (per R5), resulting in a clear violation of the "within 2 days after last required approval" timing. This single major error (misjudging a key rule and its linkage) warrants a significant deduction under strict evaluation, though the overall NON-COMPLIANT conclusion remains correct due to other violations. Format fully adheres to the prompt.
