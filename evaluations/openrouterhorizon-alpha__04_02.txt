7.0

R1: Correct.
R2: LLM says “Compliant”; ground truth says “Violated.” This is a serious logic error: it failed to recognize that after the Change_Request, the required approvals restarted the 2-day window for Ship_Goods. The LLM instead checked the time after Finance_Approval, not after the new Manager_Approval.
R3: Correct.
R4: Correct.
R5: Correct (justification equivalent).
R6: Correct.
Overall: Correct.

The main error is on R2. This is a major rule misunderstanding. Loss of points for:
- Factual error affecting compliance assessment for R2 (minus 2 points minimum).
- Minor justification length and minor wording difference elsewhere (small deduction).

R3 and R5 could be slightly more explicit, but are not wrong.

Thus, significant deduction for major compliance misjudgment: 7.0.
