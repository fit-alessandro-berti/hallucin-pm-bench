The LLM answer matches the ground truth in all rule statuses and overall result. Justifications are accurate, under 20 words, and capture the violations correctly, with minor phrasing differences (e.g., R2 emphasizes sequence over explicit 2-day calculation; R1 adds extraneous but correct details like dates). No factual errors, but strict deduction for R2's incomplete focus on the time limit and slight format inconsistencies (e.g., no bolding as in prompt).
