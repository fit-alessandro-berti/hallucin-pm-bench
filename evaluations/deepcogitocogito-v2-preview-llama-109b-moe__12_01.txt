8.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides evidence-based justifications for all three cases, mirroring the ground truth's core structure, verdict, and key observations (reversed ordering in 1001 and 1003, absence in 1002 disproving "always," non-immediate sequence in 1003). It cites case IDs and activities accurately, with logical sequencing per case. However, deductions for: (1) unnecessary verbosity (e.g., initial explanatory listing of all activities and chain-of-thought phrasing like "Okay, so I need to check," violating the "short justification" request); (2) a confusing/ imprecise wording in Case 1002 ("impossible for Authorize_Refund to follow it," which misuses "follow" relative to the claim's "before" ordering, unlike the ground truth's clear "never appears, so 'always' is disproved"); (3) relative line numbering per case instead of global lines matching the ground truth (e.g., 1003 as lines 3-5 vs. 11-14), introducing citation differences despite correct intent; (4) slightly less concise summary phrasing without the ground truth's explicit "in none of the three cases" closure. These are small but notable deviations under strict evaluation, warranting a high but not perfect score.
