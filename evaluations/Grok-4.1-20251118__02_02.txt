8.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Q1**: Perfect match to ground truth (exact count and no extras). Full points.
- **Q2**: Exact sequence match, including order and separator. Full points.
- **Q3**: Correct distinct activities identified (no hallucinations, extras, or omissions). However, the list is not alphabetically ordered as explicitly required ("Arrange_Delivery" should precede "Check_Stock"). This is a clear formatting/ordering error, treated as a significant deviation under strict criteria, deducting 1.5 points overall. The ground truth confirms the expected alphabetical order.
