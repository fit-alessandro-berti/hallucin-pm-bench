**7.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Part (a)** (~4.5/5): Identifies both decision points correctly. Rules summarized in one sentence each, with accurate logic and roles listed. Minor deductions for: non-identical naming ("Conditional Skip Rule" vs "Risk-based skip after Tri-Color-Risk-Check"; "TriVote Approval Rule" vs "“TriVote” approval gate"); imprecise phrasing ("Approve the loan" vs "advance only when... record 'Approve'"; omits "otherwise proceeds"); formatting tweaks (italics, €250,000 comma vs space); header differences.
- **Part (b)** (~2.5/5): Order of first 6 documents exact; scorecards separated correctly. Major error: omits "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as distinct document (step 8 lists it separately from "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7), resulting in incomplete list (8 vs 9 items) and shifted numbering for ID Matrix Declaration/Loan Dossier 2025. Additional deductions for: parenthetical "(step X)" additions (absent in ground truth); bolding/formatting variances.
- **Overall structure/extras** (~0/0, neutral but penalized indirectly): Unrequested "--- Explanation" section introduces interpretation (e.g., justifying omission of Signed Offer Sheet 77 as "same document"), diverging from concise ground truth format. No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML). Total reflects multiple differences, with document omission as primary strictness trigger for significant loss.
