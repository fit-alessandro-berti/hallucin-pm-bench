The LLM answer fails to match the ground truth by proposing invalid structural changes (e.g., modifying sequence flows to imply parallelism without adding required gateways, multiple conflicting diffs instead of a single valid hunk, and adding a non-existent flow), ignores the core rule against adding/deleting activities, and provides an incorrect rationale focused on reordering rather than the precise dueDate adjustment needed for 3-day SLA compliance.
