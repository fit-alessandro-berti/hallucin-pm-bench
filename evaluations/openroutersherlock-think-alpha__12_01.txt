The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and directly addresses the prompt's requirements with evidence from all relevant cases, correctly identifying the reversed ordering and absence that disprove the fact. Minor deductions for slightly less structured formatting (no explicit "verdict" phrasing or line references) and not reiterating the "immediately precede" aspect verbatim, though these do not introduce errors.
