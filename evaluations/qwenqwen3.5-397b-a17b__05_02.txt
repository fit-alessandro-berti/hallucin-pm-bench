**3.0**

The LLM answer correctly identifies and modifies the same task (`Task_CollectEquipment` dueDate) without adding/deleting elements, uses a valid single-hunk unified diff with proper context and line numbers, and provides a one-sentence rationale following the format. However, under utmost strictness, it incurs major point loss for: (1) incorrect value change to `"P3D"` instead of ground truth `"P2D"` (core content mismatch in the diff hunk); (2) rationale lacks specificity on "5 days to 2 days," "3-day SLA," or "no new activities," making it semantically different and less precise; (3) extraneous diff headers (`--- a/onboarding.bpmn` etc.) absent in ground truth. These differences prevent a match, with the value error alone warranting severe deduction.
