The LLM answer correctly states that the average cycle time cannot be determined due to a lack of timestamps. However, it omits mentioning that only event counts are provided, and does not explicitly reference the absence of start-to-completion intervals as in the ground truth answer. The answer is correct and concise, but minor details found in the ground truth are missing, resulting in a small deduction.
