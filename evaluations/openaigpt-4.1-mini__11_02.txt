8.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer closely aligns with the ground truth in core structure (memo format, ≤200 words, identifying the exact three worst activities: Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment) and factual adherence to the table (all explanations cite verifiable metrics like wait times, processing times, rework rates, and SLA breaches; no hallucinations or external activities mentioned). Recommendations are concrete and data-driven, each tied to specific issues (e.g., reducing queues/rework for Request_Documents).

However, under strict criteria, deduct points for:
- **Minor omissions in explanations (1.0 deduction)**: Misses throughput drop (190 cases/day) for Request_Documents (emphasized in GT); omits 30-min wait for Review_Documents; lacks systemic "upstream congestion" tie-in for Initial_Assessment.
- **Less precise recommendations (1.0 deduction)**: GT's actions are more measurable/innovative (e.g., "halve rework," "≈10% throughput lift," AI/triage specifics) with projected impacts; LLM's are vaguer (e.g., "investigate and streamline" vs. "automatic same-day digital requests").
- **Structural/flavor differences (0.0 major deduction, but noted)**: Adds unnecessary header details; closing emphasizes "balanced metrics" without GT's forward-looking projections, slightly diluting executive tone.

Total: High fidelity but not identical, warranting an 8.0 for strong but imperfect match.
