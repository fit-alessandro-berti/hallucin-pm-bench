8.5

### Evaluation Rationale:
- **Core Content (9.0/10):** Perfect identification of the two exact sets of concurrent tasks (Quality_Check & Update_Inventory; Generate_Replenishment_Report & Notify_Procurement), numbered correctly in process order. No extraneous info on A/C or other tasks.
- **Completeness (-0.5):** Missing explicit "No other tasks..." confirmation, though implied.
- **Formatting & Precision (-1.0):** 
  - Unnecessary introductory sentence not in ground truth.
  - "and" instead of "‖" symbol for parallelism notation.
  - No backticks around task names.
  - Lacks descriptive "– first/second parallel block:" phrasing.
- Strict deduction for all stylistic/structural differences per instructions, but high score retained as semantic accuracy is flawless.
