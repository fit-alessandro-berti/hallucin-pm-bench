4.0

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies the same three activities (Legal Approval, Risk Review, Credit Assessment) as the worst-performing based on joint SLA breaches and high waiting times, and accurately quantifies the SLA exceedances using throughput time differences (e.g., +300s for Legal Approval). These core elements align closely with the ground truth, grounding responses in the provided table data without inventions.

However, significant differences reduce the score under strict criteria:
- **Structure and Format (major deduction)**: Lacks "From," "Subject," and formal memo elements present in ground truth; intro paragraph is less precise (e.g., no mention of total cases like "4 805 completed cases" or "largest queues"). Bullet points are used correctly for recommendations only, but the overall memo feels informal and shorter (~120 words vs. ~150 target and ground truth length).
- **Content Phrasing (moderate deduction)**: Breach quantifications are correct but less explicit (e.g., omits "average throughput X s vs. Y s SLA" format; doesn't bold activities or tie waiting times as directly to "accumulating queues"). Intro redundantly lists waiting times after already stating "high waiting times," unlike ground truth's concise integration.
- **Recommendations (major deduction)**: Completely different from ground truth's concrete, data-driven actions (e.g., LLM's generic "process automation" vs. ground truth's specific "rule-based pre-checks for low-risk files"; no ties to data like case volumes, loan thresholds, or projections). LLM's suggestions are vague and not explicitly "data-driven" (e.g., no reference to cases, times, or metrics), violating the prompt's emphasis despite avoiding inventions.
- **Minor Errors (additional loss)**: No end-to-end projection or cycle time impact (present in ground truth); activity order differs (Legal-Credit-Risk vs. Legal-Risk-Credit).

Even small phrasing and completeness gaps warrant substantial point loss per instructions, resulting in a mid-low score for partial alignment on essentials but divergence on execution, specificity, and polish.
