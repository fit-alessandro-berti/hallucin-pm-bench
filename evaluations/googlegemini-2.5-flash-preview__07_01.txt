9.5

The LLM answer is very close to the ground truth and strictly factual. Task names and IDs are preserved and correctly listed under the proper headings. The style difference (using XML attribute notation for tasks) is a minor formatting difference, not a content error. Gateway type change is correctly noted, though the ground truth highlights the IDs/bold types, the LLM's description is also acceptably precise.

However, small penalty (0.5) for:

- Task entries: LLM writes out "task (id=..., name=...)" rather than the more concise format in ground truth (just Name and id). According to the “utmost strictness” instruction, this is a small deviation.
- The gateway type line in LLM says "The gateway with id ...", while ground truth gives "*gw_valid* changed from ...". The factual content is present, but slightly less concise.

There are **no factual errors or extraneous information**. This output is very strong but not perfect in format, hence 9.5.
