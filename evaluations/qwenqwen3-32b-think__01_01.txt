6.5

**Evaluation:**

**Decision Points:**
- The LLM answer only explicitly identifies the high-value branch (amount > â‚¬1,000) as a decision point.
- It misses two crucial decision points from the ground truth:
  1. **Eligibility check** at Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility (whether the claim is eligible or not).
  2. **Final payment approval** (approval or rejection at Finance_Controller_PreApprove / Senior_Auditor_Review).
- Therefore, the summary of decision points is incomplete. The LLM describes only the amount threshold; it does not summarize the eligibility validation or final approval/rejection, as explicitly required.

**Required Documents:**
- The LLM lists all required documents and accurately assigns them to the correct steps.
- It also makes clear the connection between process steps and the required artefacts.
- The LLM correctly avoids introducing non-existent artefacts or legacy activities.

**Strictness/Errors:**
- **Major deduction** is appropriate for omitting two of three essential decision points (missing eligibility check, missing approval/rejection at the final stage).
- The document list is complete, so no deduction needed there.
- Wording, structure, and reasoning are otherwise correct and faithful to constraints.

**Score Justification:**  
- -4.0 points for omitting two out of three key decision points.
- No penalty needed for documents section.
- The answer would score higher if *all* decision points were included and explained as in the ground truth.

**Final score: 6.5**
