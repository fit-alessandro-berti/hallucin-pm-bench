### Evaluation Rationale
- **Decision Points (Major Deficiencies, ~30% Match)**: The LLM answer identifies only one decision point (the high-value amount threshold after Finance_Controller_PreApprove), which partially aligns with ground truth point #2. It correctly notes the branching logic (> €1,000 → Senior_Auditor_Review with AuditTrail; ≤ €1,000 → direct to Process_Refund_Payment) but frames it as the sole decision, ignoring rejection outcomes. It completely misses ground truth point #1 (eligibility check in Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility, with explicit eligible/rejected branches) and point #3 (final approval/rejection at Finance_Controller_PreApprove or Senior_Auditor_Review, which could end the process without payment). This omission of two out of three required decision points, plus failure to summarize rejection paths, constitutes a critical failure to "summarise every decision point" as prompted. Strict deduction for incompleteness and introduction of implied flow (e.g., "continues directly") without evidence of other validations.
  
- **Required Documents (Full Match, 100%)**: The list is identical to the ground truth, including all seven documents with correct associations, the conditional note on AuditTrail (> €1,000), and the exclusion of undefined elements (e.g., no legacy activities). No extras introduced, aligning perfectly with the prompt's constraints.

- **Overall Structure and Fidelity**: The response is concise and avoids introducing undefined activities/artefacts, which is positive. However, the table format in ground truth is not required (prompt doesn't specify), so no penalty there. The note on no other decision points is accurate but undermined by the substantive misses. Total score reflects ~70% overall shortfall due to incomplete core content (decision points), evaluated strictly as instructed—major omissions like these warrant severe point loss despite strong document section.
