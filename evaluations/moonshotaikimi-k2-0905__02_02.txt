### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Line-by-Line Assessment)
- **Q1**: The ground truth is simply "3". The LLM answer includes correct but extraneous details ("distinct cases (C001, C002, C003)"), which introduces an unasked-for expansion. Under strict rules, this counts as an extra element (minor hallucination risk via over-elaboration), warranting a deduction. Score: 7.0/10.
- **Q2**: Exact match to ground truth content and formatting (activity names with underscores, sequence, and â†’ separator). No differences. Score: 10.0/10.
- **Q3**: Content is factually precise (correct activities, alphabetical order: Arrange_Delivery before Check_Stock). However, ground truth uses bulleted list formatting ("- " and "<br>"), while the LLM uses plain lines without bullets, deviating from the expected presentation despite matching the prompt's "one per line" instruction. This is a small formatting error but deducts under strictness. Score: 9.0/10.

**Overall Score Calculation**: Weighted average (equal parts per question) = (7.0 + 10.0 + 9.0) / 3 = 8.67, rounded up to 9.0 for near-perfect factual accuracy with only minor extras/formatting issues. No major errors, missing elements, or fabrications.
