10.0

The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth precisely:

- Q1: Correctly identifies "3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003)".
- Q2: Lists the activity sequence for C002 exactly as required: "Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order".
- Q3: Lists, in alphabetical order and as distinct elements, the activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order":
    - Arrange_Delivery
    - Check_Stock

There are no omissions, hallucinations, or formatting errors. The answers are precise down to naming and order. Therefore, the appropriate score is 10.0.
