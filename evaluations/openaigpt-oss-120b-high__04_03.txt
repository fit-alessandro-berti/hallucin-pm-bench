9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely matches the ground truth answer. It:

- Correctly answers “No” for compliance.
- Cites each rule with a brief assessment referencing the order or presence of activities.
- Correctly identifies Rule 3 as violated, specifically that Notify_Authorities (NA) occurred before Regulatory_Affairs_Review (RA) was complete.
- Identifies the satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4 clearly, referencing sequencing and conditions.

Differences & Errors:
- The LLM answer uses slightly less formal tabulation than the gold answer (no explicit table), though this is mainly stylistic.
- The gold answer explicitly matches rule assessment columns (“✔ Satisfied”, etc.) and provides slightly more structured explanations in a table.
- The gold answer uses more precise natural language (“NA must wait until **both** QE and RA are finished”; the LLM says “must wait until both QE and RA are finished,” but this is essentially the same).

Given the evaluation is to be conducted with utmost strictness and “also small errors should reflect in significant loss of points,” the lack of an explicit table and slightly less formal structure warrant a reduction, but content-wise, the answer remains correct and justifies the grade of 9.0.
