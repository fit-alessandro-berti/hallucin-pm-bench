The LLM answer is substantively accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth in content, correctly identifying "No" compliance, the violation in Rule 3 (NA before RA), and satisfaction of Rules 1, 2, and 4, with precise referencing to each rule. Minor deduction for format difference (bullets vs. table structure in ground truth) and slightly more explicit wording in LLM for Rule 1 (mentioning both QE and RA appear once, while ground truth omits explicit "RA once" despite implication), reflecting strict evaluation of presentation and completeness nuances.
