**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (partial credit)**: Correctly uses all four mandated terms exactly ("Intake Vetting", "KYC Review", "AML Screening", "Risk Scoring") without synonyms. Covers roles. Markdown table format.
- **Major Errors (heavy deductions)**:
  - **Added unauthorized activity**: "Payment Scheduling" (not in narrative or mandated; GT merges into "Release Funds"). Violates "do not ... add activities" → -1.5.
  - **Renamed activities incorrectly**: "Approval" (vs. GT's "Compliance Officer Approval"); "Fund Release" (vs. "Release Funds") → -1.0.
  - **RACI assignments differ in ~70% of cells** (e.g., KYC/AML: Front-Office C vs. –; CompO empty vs. C; Treas empty vs. I; Risk Scoring: CompA R/A vs. R, CompO I vs. A, Treas empty vs. I; Approval: CompA R wrongly added, Front empty vs. I; Release: misses CompA/CompO C; Intake Vetting: CompA I vs. C, Treas empty vs. I) → -2.5.
  - **Formatting inconsistencies**: No **bold** on activities/R,A; "R/A" vs. "R, A"; empty cells vs. explicit "–" → -1.0.
  - **Incomplete coverage**: 7 activities vs. GT's 6; misses nuances like Officer accountability in Risk Scoring; over/under-assigns involvement → -0.8.
- **Total**: Starts at 10.0, deducts 6.8 for cumulative differences. Small errors (e.g., cell blanks, phrasing) amplify losses per instructions.
