9.0

The LLM answer is highly accurate overall, closely mirroring the ground truth in structure (Non-compliant verdict + numbered justifications for all 5 rules), content (correct compliance status per rule, accurate violation identifications for rules 2 and 3, proper citations), and reasoning (detailed event references, correct order analysis). Minor deductions for:
- Numerical discrepancy in Rule 3 distance (LLM: "4 activities away" vs. ground truth: "distance = 3"), a small but specific calculation/phrasing error warranting ~0.5 point loss under strictness.
- Slight phrasing variations (e.g., "Met"/"Violated" vs. "Satisfied"/"Violated"; "Step" vs. "event"; extra "Conclusion" section and bolding not in ground truth), ~0.3 point loss.
- Less explicit listing of "next two activities" (7/8) in Rule 3 explanation, ~0.2 point loss.

No major factual errors, omissions, or incorrect compliance calls; violations and satisfactions align perfectly.
