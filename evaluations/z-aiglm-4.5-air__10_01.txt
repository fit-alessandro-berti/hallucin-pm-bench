4.0

### Evaluation Breakdown (Strict Assessment)
- **Terminology Adherence (Perfect Match, +2.0 points)**: The LLM answer correctly uses "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" exactly as mandated, with proper capitalization. No forbidden terms (e.g., "Customer Due Diligence", "Order Validation", "Payment Processing") appear. This aligns fully with the ground truth and prompt vocabulary policy.
  
- **Structure and Format (+1.0 point)**: The matrix has activities as rows and roles as columns, with clear headers (full names vs. ground truth's abbreviations, but functionally equivalent). It includes numbering in activity names (e.g., "1. Receive Application"), which is a minor addition but not a major deviation. No extra tasks, roles, or columns are introduced, satisfying the "unwarranted content" criterion.

- **RACI Allocations (Major Errors, -4.0 points)**: This is the core failure. The ground truth specifies a full RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) with exactly one Responsible per activity, distributed Accountable roles (often AM as A even when not R), and specific C/I assignments (e.g., CO as C for Receive Application; FC as C for KYC Review and Record Update; multiple I's across roles). The LLM simplifies to only R/A for the primary handler (correctly identifying the Responsible based on the process description) and "-" (not involved) for all others, explicitly stating in notes that no C/I are required. This omits ~70% of the ground truth's cell content:
  - Misses AM as A for KYC Review and Payment Clearance.
  - No C/I entries (e.g., CO C for Receive Application/Order Vetting/Payment Clearance; FC I for multiple steps; IT I broadly).
  - For Record Update, ground truth has AM C and FC C, but LLM has only IT R/A and "-" elsewhere.
  - Each activity thus has 3-4 mismatched cells per row. Even small inferences from the "linear handoffs" narrative (which ground truth elaborates) are contradicted by the LLM's assumptions.
  - Strictness: These are not minor; they fundamentally alter the matrix's completeness and accuracy against the ground truth benchmark.

- **Additional Content (Minor Deduction, -1.0 point)**: The LLM adds a "Key" section (explaining R/A/-) and "Notes" (elaborating roles and justifying no C/I), which are unwarranted as the prompt requests only the matrix. The ground truth has no such extras. This introduces self-justification that conflicts with ground truth implications (e.g., claiming "no roles... Consulted or Informed" directly opposes the C/I presences).

- **Overall Correctness and Reflection of Narrative (-2.0 points)**: While the LLM correctly maps the basic "handled by" Responsibilities to the process description (each activity has one R), it fails to reflect the ground truth's fuller interpretation (e.g., AM's overarching Accountability, implied consultations in a workflow). No self-awareness issues, but the output ignores potential handoff nuances, leading to an incomplete RACI.

**Total Score Rationale**: Base of 10.0, with deductions for pervasive cell-level differences (primary flaw) and extras. The terminology and basic R mappings prevent a 1.0, but strict rubric demands near-exact matchâ€”resulting in a low-mid score.
