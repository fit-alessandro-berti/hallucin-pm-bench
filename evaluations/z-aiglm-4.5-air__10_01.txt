6.0

The LLM answer fulfills the vocabulary requirements and does not use or reference any forbidden terms, which is critical. It presents clear rows with the correct preferred terminology (*KYC Review*, *Order Vetting*, *Payment Clearance*) and assigns precise roles for each activity with no additional extraneous content.

However, there are **notable errors** relative to the ground truth that must significantly reduce the score:

1. **RACI assignments are over-simplified**:
    - The LLM answer assigns only R/A (Responsible/Accountable) for each activity to a single role (occasionally both to the same role), and completely omits any *Consulted* (C) or *Informed* (I) entries, although the process lists these role involvements. The ground truth matrix carefully specifies C and I assignments for each step, which are essential for clarity and process accuracy.
2. **Specific assignment errors**:
    - *Receive Application*: The ground truth lists AM as R/A, CO as C, FC and IT as I, but LLM marks only AM as R/A.
    - *KYC Review*: Should be CO as R, AM as A, FC as C, IT as I. LLM lists only CO as R/A.
    - *Order Vetting*: Should be AM as R/A, CO as C, FC and IT as I. LLM lists only AM as R/A.
    - *Payment Clearance*: Should be FC as R, AM as A, CO as C, IT as I. LLM lists only FC as R/A.
    - *Record Update*: Should be IT as R, AM and FC as C, CO as I. LLM lists only IT as R/A.
    - *Notify Customer*: Should be AM as R/A, all others as I. LLM lists only AM as R/A.

3. **Loss of nuance**:
    - The key and notes misleadingly assert that only R/A are needed, when the process is explicitly expected to capture C/I as well.

4. **Formatting**:
    - The matrix layout and terminology are fine, but the departure from the ground truth structure (use of "/" for combined roles, concise I/C allocations) diminishes direct comparability.

**In summary:** While the answer is compliant in wording and structure, it misses critical role attributions, especially for C and I. Each omission is significant and justifies a substantial point deduction. Scoring stricter for process mapping accuracy and RACI completeness, a 6.0 is appropriate.
