7.5

The LLM answer correctly identifies the occurrence (1) and percentages (2a: 2.08%; 2b: 8.33%), matching the ground truth exactly for these deterministic parts. However, the explanation for question 3 is incomplete and only partially meets the criteria: it implies rarity ("low-support," "uncommon") but does not explicitly mention the single-occurrence issue (e.g., no reference to "only once" or its implications); it vaguely notes bias/overfitting as a form of instability but omits specifics like variance, noise, skewing statistics, or wide confidence intervals; and while it cautions against over-generalization (e.g., "may not generalize well," "biased or misleading insights"), it focuses too narrowly on predictive models and overfitting without addressing broader performance analyses or the unreliability of n=1 estimates. This results in a strict deduction for lacking precision and key elements in the explanation, despite staying under 100 words and being thematically relevant.
