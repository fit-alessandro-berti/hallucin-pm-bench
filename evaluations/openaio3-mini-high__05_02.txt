The LLM answer provides an identical diff hunk to the ground truth, correctly modifying only the dueDate attribute as required without adding or deleting elements, but the rationale loses points for lacking specificity on the exact day reduction (5 to 2 days), the 3-day contractual SLA context, and the explicit note on avoiding new activities, making it less precise and explanatory under strict evaluation.
