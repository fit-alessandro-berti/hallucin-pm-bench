The LLM answer is almost identical to the ground truth. The unified diff is correct (it reduces the due date for "Collect Equipment" from P5D to P2D) and in the prescribed single-hunk style. The rationale is concise and accurate, stating that this shortens the overall process duration and improves SLA compliance. 

However, it slightly falls short on full precision:  
- The rationale lacks the explicit mention of the "contractual 3-day SLA," a key detail in the ground truth.  
- It does not clearly state that the change "keeps the overall onboarding cycle inside the SLA," focusing instead on general improvement.

These small but important omissions merit a full point deduction for strictness per your instructions.
