9.0

The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate ("No") and provides a valid justification by citing relevant sequences from C001 (supporting immediate succession), C002, and C004 (counterexamples with intervening activities), which is sufficient to disprove the "always" claim. No factual errors in the sequences or timestamps are present, and the explanation aligns with the log evidence.

However, under utmost strictness, the answer loses 1.0 point for incompleteness: it omits C003 (another case of immediate succession, like C001), failing to provide a fully exhaustive case-by-case analysis as in the ground truth. This reduces thoroughness, though it does not alter the correctness of the disproof. The bullet-point format is clear but less structured than the ground truth's table, warranting a minor deduction for presentation differences.
