**9.7**

The LLM answer is highly accurate, concise, and evidence-based, correctly identifying the fact as inaccurate via precise counterexamples from all three cases, using timestamps from the data. It strictly adheres to the event log without guessing.

Minor deductions for:
- Unnecessary detail in Case 1002 (mentioning "after Inspect_Item", irrelevant to the claim about "Authorize_Refund" before "Update_Inventory").
- Slightly interpretive phrasing ("the opposite is more common"), which is factually true (2/3 cases reversed) but less neutral/precise than ground truth's strict "in none... immediately precede"; introduces mild subjectivity on a tiny dataset.
- Stylistic differences (no explicit line citations, "not accurate" vs. "inaccurate", no "Short verdict" header), reducing exactness under utmost strictness.

No factual errors; differences are trivial but warrant small point loss per instructions.
