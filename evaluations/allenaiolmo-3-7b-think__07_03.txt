3.0

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Headings**: Matches verbatim (minor formatting whitespace differences ignored as negligible).
- **ADDED TASKS**: IDs correct (3/3), but **all entries use task *type* (e.g., "serviceTask") instead of *name* (e.g., "Automated Fraud Check") as explicitly required ("the `name` in parentheses")**. This is a fundamental format violation across every line (-2.5 pts per section equivalent). Extra type info is unrequested and deviates from "concrete differences" spec.
- **REMOVED TASKS**: ID correct (1/1), but **uses type ("userTask") instead of name ("Manual Review")** — same format violation (-1.5 pts).
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: Format correct for listed item, but **misses verifiable Gateway_Payment change (exclusive → parallel)**, present in both XMLs (-3.0 pts for incompleteness; only 1/2 changes listed).
- **Overall**: Detected most tasks correctly but zero adherence to name-in-parentheses rule (all 4 task lines invalid); missed 1/2 gateways. No extraneous commentary (minor +). Strict policy: these are not "small errors" — they violate core output spec, warranting major deduction from 10.0. Effective accuracy ~30%.
