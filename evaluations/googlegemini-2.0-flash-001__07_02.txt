### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer correctly identifies all key changes: three added tasks (by ID), one removed task (by ID), and the exact gateway type change (Exclusive → Inclusive, matching the prompt's example phrasing). No extraneous changes are invented, and it adheres to the required headings without discussing ignored elements like renamings (e.g., "Review Application" name unchanged but "Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check" ignored properly) or flows.

However, under strict criteria:
- **Missing task names**: Lists only IDs, omitting descriptive names (e.g., "Verify Identity" instead of just `Task_VerifyIdentity`), which reduces clarity and differs from the ground truth's bolded name + ID format. This is a significant omission for a "meticulous" summary, as names convey semantic intent.
- **Formatting inconsistencies**: Uses simple bullets (*) without numbering, bolding, or backticks for IDs, unlike the ground truth's structured numbered list. Headings lack bolding or markdown emphasis.
- **Extra text**: Includes an unnecessary introductory sentence ("Okay, here's..."), violating the "strictly under the three requested headings" instruction.
- **Gateway detail**: Concise but lacks ground truth's added precision (e.g., "XOR" and "OR" explanations, version references), making it slightly less comprehensive.

These differences (content gaps and non-strict adherence) warrant a deduction from a perfect score, but the core accuracy prevents a lower rating.
