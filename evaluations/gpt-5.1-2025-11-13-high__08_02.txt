The LLM answer is factually identical to the ground truth in content, sequence, and reasoning. It correctly identifies that T5 can fire before T3 via the provided minimal firing sequence (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), with accurate marking transitions and the key insight that T5 consumes the P2 token, disabling T3 afterward. Stylistic differences (e.g., labeling as "Answer 1/2" vs. "Q1/Q2", bolding, and phrasing of confirmation) do not introduce errors or deviations, fully aligning with the prompt's requirements and word limit.
