The LLM answer closely matches the ground truth in content, structure, and intent: both correctly state that the average cycle time cannot be computed due to the absence of timestamps or durations in the provided log, and both provide a clear reasoning explanation tied to the data limitations. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., "redacted" vs. "lacks" and explicit mention of fields) do not constitute errors, as they align with the prompt's details without introducing inaccuracies or extraneous information. The response adheres strictly to the system's guidelines by declining unsupported computation.
