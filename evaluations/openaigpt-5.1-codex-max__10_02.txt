**2.0**

The LLM answer has substantial differences from the ground truth across multiple dimensions, warranting a low score under strict evaluation criteria:

- **Table structure/format**: LLM uses traditional RACI columns (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) with tasks as rows. Ground truth uses roles as columns with R/A/C/I letters in cells, task/activity header with mandated wording note, and a legend. This is a fundamental mismatch.
- **Roles**: LLM uses Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support. Ground truth uses Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, Operations Manager, IT Support. LLM omits Operations Manager (present as Accountable in nearly all ground truth rows) and lacks full role coverage per row.
- **Tasks**: LLM has 8 rows with detailed phrasing (e.g., "Receive transfer instruction and log it in the system", separate "Ensure the SWIFT message is sent", "Notify Regulatory Liaison of case completion"). Ground truth has exactly 6 concise rows (e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction", no separate SWIFT/notify, "Archive Record" combines elements). LLM adds unsubtle splits/inferences not in ground truth.
- **RACI assignments**: Almost no exact matches even for overlapping tasks. Examples:
  | Task (approx match) | LLM | Ground Truth |
  |---------------------|-----|--------------|
  | Receive | TA (R/A) | TA (**R**), RL (I), OpsM (**A**), IT (C) |
  | Screen | TA (R), RL (A) | TA (**R**), RL (**A**), OpsM (I), IT (C) |
  | KYC Review | RL (R/A), TA (C) | TA (C), RL (**R**), OpsM (**A**), IT (I) |
  | Approve high-risk | RL (R/A), TA (C), IT (I) | TA (C), RL (**R**), OpsM (**A**), IT (I) |
  | Release | TA (R/A), RL (C), IT (I) | TA (**R**), RL (I), OpsM (**A**), IT (C) |
  Partial overlaps (e.g., screening R/A), but consistent divergence on Accountable (often self vs. OpsM), and extras like IT Informed where not matching.
- **Other**: LLM uses "—" for blanks (incomplete coverage); ground truth fills every cell with a letter. No legend or explanatory note in LLM. Task phrasings differ (e.g., no "on sender and beneficiary", "Payment Instruction" vs. source-like detail). While LLM adheres to vocabulary mandate perfectly, it introduces extra content not in ground truth.

These are not small errors—core content (assignments, roles, tasks, structure) diverges significantly, justifying major point loss. LLM covers source but doesn't replicate ground truth.
