### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Strengths (driving high score)**: Identical three activities (Request_Documents, Review_Documents, Initial_Assessment), correctly selected as worst by key metrics (wait, throughput drop, processing time, stdev, rework, SLA breaches—all strictly from table). Explanations cite exact table values accurately (e.g., 150 min wait, 22% rework, 25 min processing, 12.4% SLA). Each has **one concrete, data-driven action** with specific, measurable targets (e.g., "rework from 22% to <10%", "stdev from 9 to ~5", "wait from 18 to <10 min")—matches GT's precision. Concise (<200 words), no absent activities, no guessing on unclear metrics. Format is executive-memo-like (To:/Subject/numbered issues/actions).
- **Deductions (strict penalties for differences/errors, -0.8 total)**:
  - Minor factual inaccuracy (-0.4): #3 claims Initial_Assessment has "**highest throughput shortfall vs upstream (270 vs 280/day)**"—false; table shows larger drop before Request_Documents (270→190, -80 vs -10). GT avoids this, focusing on wait/processing/SLA.
  - Structural/style diffs (-0.2): Lacks GT's intro ("data isolate three clear performance hotspots") and closing projection (10% throughput lift, 40% SLA reduction); more email-like vs pure memo.
  - Emphasis gaps (-0.2): #2 omits Review_Documents' 30 min wait (cited in GT); interpretive phrasing like "primary bottleneck" vs GT's neutral tone.
  
Near-perfect match (92% alignment), but strict rubric demands zero variances—small issues cost dearly. No hallucinations, fully table-bound.
