The LLM answer correctly identifies the exact two parallel pairs from Process B, in the required alphabetical order (both within pairs and overall), and uses the specified format with one pair per line. The content matches the ground truth perfectly. However, the ground truth includes precise alignment spacing (extra spaces before "Procure_Materials" on the second line to vertically align the em dashes in a monospace-style output), which is absent hereâ€”deducting 0.5 points for this minor formatting discrepancy under strict evaluation.
