9.0

The LLM answer provides both required pairs, with no extra or incorrect pairs, and aligns with the order requested. However, the formatting differs slightly from the ground truth: the LLM answer lacks the exact alignment and spacing between task names and the en dash (e.g., two spaces on each side of the en dash in the ground truth), and does not wrap the output in code block formatting as in the ground truth. 

These are minor but explicit formatting differences, which should yield a deduction per the "utmost strictness" instruction. However, the content is otherwise perfect and there are no substantive errors.

Final score: 9.0
