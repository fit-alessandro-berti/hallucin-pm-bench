- A1: Correct (Distinction in formatting/wording only; content is correct.)
- A2: Correct
- A3: Correct

The LLM's answer is accurate in all three answers. All substantive information matches the ground truth. The only (very minor) deviations are slight differences in formatting ("â€¢ Distinct cases: 3 (C123, C456, C789)" vs "3 cases (C123, C456, C789)") and use of en-dash instead of colon, which do not impact the correctness or clarity of the response.

**Deduction:** 1 point for not strictly following the instruction "concise, bullet-point answers only"; the first bullet provides case values in parentheses, slightly exceeding pure conciseness, and deviates from ground truth's numbering/labelling.

**Summary:** Substantially perfect, but minor loss of strict conciseness/format consistency as requested.
