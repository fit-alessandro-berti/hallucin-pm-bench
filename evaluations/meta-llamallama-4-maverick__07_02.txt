**Score: 9.0**

**Justification:**
- The LLM answer correctly identifies every change strictly under the requested headings with no extraneous or missing items.
- Formatting is very close to ground truth, and item ordering is preserved.
- **Small issues:**
  - "Task_ApproveLoan" appears renamed in v2 ("Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan"), but as per instructions, cosmetic renamings are to be ignored, so this is appropriately omitted.
  - The gateway-type change is correctly identified; however, it would be ideal to clarify the full transition ("exclusive" (XOR) → "inclusive" (OR)), mirroring the ground truth's explicit notation.
  - The gateway's name change ("Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check") is cosmetic and rightly ignored.
  - The minor reduction is due to the gateway-type change being stated as "Exclusive Gateway to Inclusive Gateway" instead of the slightly more explicit ("exclusive (XOR)" to "inclusive (OR)"). This reflects a small loss of precision/detail.

**There are no logical, factual, or grouping errors.**  
**One point is subtracted to reflect lack of perfect explicitness in describing the gateway-type change.**
