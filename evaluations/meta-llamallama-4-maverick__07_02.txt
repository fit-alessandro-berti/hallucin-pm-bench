### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer accurately identifies all key changes: three tasks added (Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject), one task removed (Task_RejectLoan), and the correct gateway-type change (exclusive to inclusive for Gateway_Decision). It adheres strictly to the three required headings and ignores irrelevant aspects like renamings (e.g., "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan") or flow modifications, matching the ground truth content precisely.

Minor deductions (-1.0 total) for small formatting and stylistic differences, evaluated strictly as per instructions:
- Uses bullet points (*) instead of numbered lists (1., 2., etc.), including for the single removed task.
- Reverses presentation in added/removed tasks (ID first, then name in quotes) vs. ground truth (bold name first, then ID in backticks).
- Adds an unrequested overall title ("Changes between BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2").
- Omits the ground truth's explanatory details in the gateway change (e.g., "(XOR)" and "(OR)", version specifics "*v1* to *v2*") and the closing note "(No other... present.)", though these are not required by the prompt.
- Uses "####" subheadings and italicized name in gateway (minor inconsistency vs. ground truth's bold/escaped formatting).

No factual errors or omissions; differences are cosmetic and do not alter meaning or completeness.
