7.5

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment Against Ground Truth):
- **Decision Points (Core Match: Strong, but Minor Omissions and Additions Deduct Points)**: The three decision points are correctly identified and described in substance (Underwriter Alignment Gate, Amount Threshold Decision, Final Micro-loan Board Approval). However, strict comparison reveals deductions for: (1) LLM adds unrequested step numbers (e.g., "Step 5", "Step 6"), which GT omits; (2) Point 1 in LLM uses generic "risk scores" without naming "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B" inline (GT includes this explicitly); (3) Point 2 in LLM lacks GT's precise context "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check" and says "Proceed to Step 8" vs. GT's "send to Final Micro-loan Board Approval"; (4) Point 3 in LLM adds "the loan" and lowercase "approve or reject" vs. GT's capitalized "**Approve** or **Reject**" without extras. These small structural/contextual differences cause a ~1.5 point loss from perfection.
  
- **Required Documents (Core Match: Good, but Wording Inconsistencies Deduct Heavily)**: All six documents are listed correctly in order. However, per strictness on even small errors: (1) Item 2: LLM's "≤ 3 months old" adds "old" vs. GT's concise "≤ 3 months" (-0.5); (2) Item 3: LLM's "(single pay-stub or tax slip)" expands with "single" and "or" vs. GT's abbreviated "(pay-stub/tax slip)" (-0.5); (3) Item 4: LLM's "(CIS) template" includes extra "template" vs. GT's "(CIS)" (-0.5). These precise phrasing mismatches reflect significant loss as instructed.

- **Overall Structure and Extras (Further Deductions)**: LLM introduces unrequested "Key Notes" section with restatements (e.g., no credit-bureau, underwriter details, board role), which deviates from GT's clean format and closing note on standard docs absence. Headers use "###" vs. GT's "####", and bullet styles differ slightly (e.g., LLM's sub-bullets vs. GT's italicized prose). No introduction of forbidden terminology, but extras inflate beyond the prompt's "summarise... and list" scope (-1.0 total).

- **Total Score Justification**: Near-perfect content fidelity (90%+ alignment), but strict policy on small errors (wording, omissions, additions) justifies dropping below 8.0 to 7.5. No major factual errors, but cumulative minor deviations prevent higher.
