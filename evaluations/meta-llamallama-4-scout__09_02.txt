The LLM answer correctly identifies that the average cycle time cannot be calculated due to the absence of timestamps, aligning with the ground truth's core reasoning. However, it deviates significantly by providing an unnecessary multi-step explanation (violating the prompt's instruction for "one concise sentence" if undetermined), resulting in verbosity and non-conciseness that inflate the response beyond the expected format. Minor phrasing differences (e.g., omitting explicit mention of "duration information," "event counts," and "start-to-completion intervals") further reduce precision, warranting a substantial deduction under strict evaluation criteria.
