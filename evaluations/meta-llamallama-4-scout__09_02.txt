9.0

The LLM answer is accurate, well-structured, and explicitly states the correct reason: that the calculation is impossible because no timestamps or temporal information are supplied, only counts. The answer is more verbose and walks through several steps to arrive at this, but does not introduce any incorrect information.

However, per the instruction to grade with utmost strictness and penalize for even small deviations:  
- The answer is needlessly elaborate given the prompt’s instruction for "one concise sentence,” whereas the ground truth is a single direct sentence.  
- The final sentence repeats the explanation, slightly reducing conciseness.

Thus, while the logic and information are fully correct, the minor verbosity and lack of direct succinctness compared to the ground truth merits a deduction.

**Final score: 9.0**
