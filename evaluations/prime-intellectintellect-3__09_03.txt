The LLM answer correctly identifies the core issue (redacted event log lacking timestamps prevents computation of cycle time, average, std dev, and CI) and structures it as one short paragraph per instructions, without guessing or using external knowledge. It precisely references Artefact A and ties the explanation to the missing data needed for "Approve Invoice". Minor deductions for slightly less granular phrasing (e.g., "entirely redacted" vs. explicitly noting "only column headers; all event rows...every timestamp (start_time / complete_time)"; no mention of "dispersion" or "additional raw log entries required"), which reduces perfect fidelity under utmost strictness.
