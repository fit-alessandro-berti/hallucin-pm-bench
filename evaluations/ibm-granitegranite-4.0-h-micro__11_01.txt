3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (major deduction: -4.0 points)**: Activities and waiting-time figures (avg and 95th percentile) are accurately quoted verbatim from the table for the correct three activities. However, the ranking is fundamentally incorrect—#1 (worst) should be Request_Documents (36.5h avg), not Send_Closure_Letter (12.2h avg). This swaps #1 and #2, violating the strict "by waiting-time" ranking requirement. Initial_Screening (2.1h) is correctly excluded.
- **No unwarranted content (full credit: +2.0 points)**: No discussion of service-time, throughput, or extraneous activities. Stays focused.
- **Action relevance (partial credit: +1.5 points)**: Each action is concrete, logically tied to waiting-time issues (e.g., automation for delays), and explicitly targets ≥20% reduction. However, they lack the "data-driven" depth of the ground truth (e.g., no pilots, estimates, or evidence-based specifics like "24h escalation triggers" or "30% reduction"), making them more generic than required.
- **Format and constraints (partial credit: +1.0 point)**: Memo is crisp, professional, and under 150 words (~120 words). Includes all required elements but adds unnecessary framing (subject, greeting, sign-off) not in ground truth, slightly diluting executive crispness.
- **Overall strictness**: The ranking error is a critical failure in core prompt compliance, warranting severe penalty despite partial alignment elsewhere. Small formatting flourishes and action vagueness compound minor losses.
