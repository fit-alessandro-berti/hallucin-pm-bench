**5.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)
- **Decision Points (Major Errors, ~40% of score deduction)**: LLM lists **4 points** vs. ground truth's **3 exact points**. Adds non-ground-truth **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** as #1 (speculative failure implication not in flow; omitted in GT as not a branching "decision point"). Omits GT specifics: "branch after the Dual Underwriter Split"; names "Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B"; "after Neighbourhood Feedback Check"; "**Approve**/**Reject** capitalization. LLM's descriptions are close but not verbatim/positional matches. Significant addition + omissions = large deviation.
- **Required Documents (Minor Errors, ~20% deduction)**: Lists all 6 correctly but not verbatim: "≤ 3 months **old**" (extra word); "**single** pay-stub **or** tax slip" (extra "single", "or" vs "/"); "**CIS** **template**" (extra "template"); bulleted vs. numbered; omits GT's excluding note. Small phrasing/formatting diffs count heavily under strictness.
- **Overall Structure/Terminology**: Uses exact activity names (good), no standard loan terms (good), but headers "##" vs. "####"; bolding/capitalization mismatches. Total differences too numerous for high score despite ~70% content overlap.
