**10.0**

The LLM answer is fully correct and complete. Questions 1, 2a, and 2b match the deterministic ground truth exactly in values, calculations, and explanations (minor formatting like "%" spacing or "×100" omission is negligible under strict evaluation, as math is precise). For 3, it is ≤100 words (65 words), explicitly addresses single occurrence ("single occurrence"), variance/instability ("outlier rather than a stable pattern"; "low-support"), and over-generalization ("distorting"; "overfitting"; "misrepresent"), fully satisfying criteria without invention or deviation from the log. No errors.
