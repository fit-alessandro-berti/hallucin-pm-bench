**2.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict criteria):
- **Partial credit (+2.0)**: Correctly identifies timer on `Task_Receive` with 48-hour duration; references IDs; plain English, concise (<120 words); no new tasks.
- **Major deductions (-8.0)**:
  - **Invalid new element**: Introduces non-existent "Escalation" gateway (violates "reconnect existing flows" + "uses existing elements" claim).
  - **Wrong logic/SLA compliance**: Diverts to escalation *instead of* ensuring reach `Task_Triage` (GT bypasses to Triage); misinterprets SLA as optional reach vs. enforced arrival.
  - **Imprecise/inaccurate BPMN**: Vague "timer event at activity" (GT specifies *interrupting boundary* + `PT48H` + ID `Timer_48h`); calls `Task_Triage` an "event"; no new sequenceFlow specified.
  - **No bypass explanation**: Ignores doc request loop; doesn't ensure "within 48 hours of submission."

Solution is fundamentally divergent and non-compliant.
