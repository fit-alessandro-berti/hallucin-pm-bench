8.0

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Question 1 (50% weight)**: Exact match to ground truth (1 occurrence, CaseID 1002). Full points: 5/5.
- **Question 2 (50% weight)**: Strong coverage of small sample size (3 cases, ~2 hours vs. full month) and naming inconsistencies/synonyms (e.g., automatic variants implying risks for manual). However, deducts for: (1) lack of precise quantification (e.g., frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence interval, sampling error for rare events); (2) added speculative elements (e.g., variations by "applicant risk profiles, system changes, peak hours, weekends, policy updates") not strictly tied to the excerpt, violating the "no speculation" rule; (3) minor phrasing shifts (e.g., "temporal bias" vs. explicit "extreme sampling error"). Partial points: 3/5.
- **Overall**: Concise (under 120 words), structured response aligns directionally but has notable differences in depth, precision, and adherence, warranting deductions under strict criteria.
