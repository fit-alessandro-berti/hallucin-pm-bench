The LLM answer correctly identifies that the calculation cannot be performed due to the lack of timestamp information. However, it omits the explicit mention of the missing duration information and the absence of start-to-completion intervals, which are stated in the ground truth answer. The LLM answer is concise and accurate, but lacks the additional detail present in the ground truth. Therefore, it loses 1 full point for brevity and slightly less explicit reasoning.
