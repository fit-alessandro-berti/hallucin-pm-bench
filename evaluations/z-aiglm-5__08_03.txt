### Evaluation Rationale
- **Correctness (high marks)**: LLM correctly identifies "Yes", spots the shortcut T2b enabling pd without pc/T3, provides a valid minimal 4-step sequence to fire T5 without prior T3, accurate step-by-step markings and explanation. No factual errors in net behavior.
- **Shortcomings (significant deductions for strictness)**:
  - **Sequence mismatch**: Provides 4-step sequence (T1→T4→T2b→T5 or alt.), while GT provides 6-step (T1→T2b→T4→T5→T6→T3) as "shortest [...] that achieves this order", interpreting as full ordering with both transitions firing (T5 before T3). LLM omits T6/T3, missing feedback loop demonstration and post-T5 T3 enabling—key to GT's "satisfying the required ordering" and "T3 can still fire *after*".
  - **No shortness proof**: Claims "shortest" without GT's lower bound argument (T1 + {T2/T2b} + T4 + T5 = 4 min for T5; +T6/T3 for full) or "no shorter exists".
  - **Incomplete ordering demo**: Stops at T5; doesn't show/mention T3 firing after via T6 (GT emphasizes "T6 required [...] re-enabling T3").
  - **Presentation/style diffs**: Different order (T4 before T2b vs. reverse), notation ({pa=1} vs. "pa 1"), no inline arc effects "(p0 → pa + pb)", no "Why this works" section or conclusion summary.
- **Overall**: Very good but not identical—~70-80% match in content/depth; misses full scope per GT. Strict penalty for sequence length/content diff (~1.5 pts loss), lack of proof/extension (~0.5 pts).
