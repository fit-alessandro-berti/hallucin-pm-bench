**3.2**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Verdict correctness (weight: high)**: Correctly states "inaccurate/No" (+2.0). Matches ground truth.
- **Overall structure & brevity**: Provides short justification with case citations and activities, as prompted (+0.8). Similar to ground truth's bullet format.
- **Factual accuracy & evidence**:
  - Case 1001: Correctly identifies reversed order ("Update_Inventory ... first, followed ... by Authorize_Refund") (+0.5), but **major error**: Wrong timestamps (08:30:02 for Update instead of 08:25:55; 08:45:12 for Authorize instead of 08:30:02) (-1.5). Misreads log.
  - Case 1002: Notes absence correctly but weakly ("no evidence"), missing strong disproof of "always" (-0.5 vs. ground truth's explicit point).
  - Case 1003: Accurate order and timestamps (+0.6).
  - Summary: **Critical error**: Claims "`Update_Inventory` occurs *after* `Authorize_Refund`" -- exactly backwards vs. data (Update *before* Authorize) and own per-case analysis (-2.0). Supports claim's order if true; undermines justification. Ignores "immediately" fully.
- **Precision & no extras/guesses**: Sticks to data but adds unnecessary dates; no hallucination (+0.3). Ground truth uses line refs for precision (LLM lacks).
- **Strict penalty for errors**: Timestamps (small but data-based: -1.0), conclusion inversion (major logical flaw: -1.5), weaker 1002 handling (-0.3). Total deductions exceed credits.

Net: Major differences in accuracy/details justify low-mid score despite right verdict.
