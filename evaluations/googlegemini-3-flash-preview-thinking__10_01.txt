The LLM answer correctly uses all mandated terminology ("KYC Review", "Order Vetting", "Payment Clearance") with exact spelling and capitalization, and avoids forbidden terms entirely—full credit here (+2.0 points potential). Activities match exactly, and no extra tasks, roles, or columns are added.

However, the RACI allocations differ substantially from the ground truth in 15 of 24 cells (62.5% mismatch rate), including:
- Frequent incorrect use of "-" (not involved) where GT specifies "I" (Informed) or "C" (Consulted), e.g., IT Support as "-" in 5/6 rows vs. "I" in GT.
- Misplacement of "A" (Accountable), often combining "R/A" on the wrong role (e.g., KYC Review: CO "R/A" vs. GT CO "R" + AM "A"; Payment Clearance: FC "R/A" vs. FC "R" + AM "A").
- Specific errors like CO "I" vs. "C" (Receive Application), AM "I" vs. "A" (KYC Review), AM "I" vs. "C" (Record Update).

Headers include unwarranted abbreviations "(AM)", "(CO)", etc., absent in GT. Formatting differs (e.g., "R/A" vs. "**R / A**"; inconsistent bolding). Unwarranted intro text and legend added.

Under utmost strictness, these are not small errors—core matrix content fails to match, warranting major deductions (-6.0 total). Structure/terminology salvage partial credit.
