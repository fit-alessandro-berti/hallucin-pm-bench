The LLM answer exactly matches the ground truth answer. Each numbered line correctly lists the tasks of one parallel block (P1, P2, P3) separated by commas, and there are no extraneous or missing tasks. Tasks from Process B only are mentioned, and only the concurrent (not sequential) ones are enumerated. No errors are present.
