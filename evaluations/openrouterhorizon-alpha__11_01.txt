8.0

The LLM answer is accurate in terms of identifying and ranking the three activities with the longest average waiting times, quoting the correct average and 95th-percentile figures exactly as in the source table. It also strictly avoids mentioning any service-time, throughput, or non-required activities/metrics, as requested.

Minor but notable shortcomings affecting the score:

- **Prescriptive Actions**: While the recommendations are reasonable and clearly target waiting-time reduction, they are more generic and less tightly linked to the ground truth than required. For example:
  - For #1, the LLM action includes “…prioritize cases with ≥48 h idle…” and “…daily backlog queue,” which, while plausible, is not mentioned in the ground truth, and the specific “pilot tests” support or quantified impact is absent.
  - For #2, batch-sending every hour and “SLA alerts at 24 h” differs slightly from ground truth’s explicit switch to e-signature and immediate generation at closure.
  - For #3, “skill-based routing” and “next-best-case pull” is more process/balancing-oriented, compared to the ground truth’s explicit pre-classification so that simple cases bypass senior adjuster queues.

- **Action Impact Evidence**: The ground truth specifies that pilots/estimates support ≥20% (or exact) impact, whereas the LLM answer asserts a “≥20% cut” as a target, but does not justify it as clearly or reference observed data.

- **Verbatim Quotation**: The ground truth says waiting figures should be quoted “verbatim.” The LLM answer rounds units slightly (“Avg wait 36.5 h; 95th pct 120.0 h” vs “avg 36.5 h, p95 120 h”) – though not a significant error, this is a minor deviation from strict verbatim quoting required.

- **Economy of Words**: The LLM answer slightly exceeds the factual and concise style by adding redundant phrases (e.g., “Target: ≥20% cut by…” per item).

Overall, the answer fulfills the prompt requirements well but demonstrates small deviations and lack of precise, evidence-backed recommendations as per the ground truth, resulting in a two-point penalty.
