The LLM answer correctly identifies and ranks the top three activities by average waiting time (Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, Assess_Liability), quotes the exact waiting-time figures from the table (including decimals), and provides concrete, relevant actions logically tied to waiting issues while promising ≥20% reductions without extraneous content (no service times, other activities, or throughput). It stays under 150 words (approx. 120) and maintains a crisp executive format.

Minor deductions for differences from ground truth: slightly more verbose action descriptions (e.g., LLM's multi-part suggestions vs. ground truth's concise, single-focus remedies) and invented reduction specifics in ground truth (e.g., "pilot tests show ≥25%") are absent in LLM, but action wording diverges entirely, reducing exact match. No major errors, but strict alignment to ground truth phrasing/format warrants a small loss.
