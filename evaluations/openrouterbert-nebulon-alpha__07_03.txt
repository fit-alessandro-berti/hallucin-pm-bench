The LLM answer correctly identifies all functional changes (added tasks, removed task, and both gateway changes) with exact IDs and names matching the ground truth and XML. However, under utmost strictness:

- Extra leading `-` before each of the 3 headings (not present in ground truth).
- List items lack leading `-` bullets (present in ground truth for all 6 items) and use 2-space indentation instead.
- Unnecessary backticks around all 6 IDs (absent in ground truth).
- Missing column alignment spaces on the second gateway line (present in ground truth for "Gateway_Payment:     exclusive → parallel").

These are multiple small formatting deviations (9+ specific differences), causing a significant but not catastrophic deduction from a perfect content match.
