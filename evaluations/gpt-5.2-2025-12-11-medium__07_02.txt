The LLM answer correctly identifies and lists **all** required changes with 100% accuracy in content (added: 3 tasks; removed: 1 task; gateway: exclusive to inclusive), matching the ground truth facts precisely. No misses, extras, or errors in detection.

Minor deductions (-0.8 total) for strictness on:
- Presentation order reversed (ID first vs. name first in ground truth).
- Bullets vs. numbered lists.
- Slight phrasing variance in gateway ("exclusiveGateway (v1)" vs. "exclusive (XOR) in v1").
- Markdown/quoting differences (### headings with (e.g.) vs. * **; quotes vs. no quotes).
- Missing intro "## **Expected Answer Key**" and final note (though not required by prompt).

Semantically and functionally identical to ground truth; differences are cosmetic/stylistic only.
