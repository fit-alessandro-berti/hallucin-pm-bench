The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as false ("No") and provides a accurate justification in one paragraph, citing relevant case-IDs (C001, C002, C003, C004, C005) and line numbers to support both confirming instances and the critical counterexamples in C003 (Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order) and C005 (no Receive_Order at all). This aligns closely with the ground truth's focus on disproving the "always" claim via the same counterexamples. Minor deductions for including unnecessary details on positive cases (C001, C002, C004, which the ground truth omits) and the irrelevant mention of Cancel_Order in C005, as these add extraneous content without error but deviate slightly from the concise structure of the ground truth.
