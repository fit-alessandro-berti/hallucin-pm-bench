**7.0**

### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Q1-Q4**: Perfect match (identical to ground truth) → full points.
- **Q5**: Significant error. LLM incorrectly includes `"Quality_Check"` (which *does* appear as the first event in case C-77) and omits `"Validate_Order"` (which never appears first). Only 2/3 items correct ("Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"). This is a factual misunderstanding of "first event per case," warranting major deduction under strict criteria.
- **Overall**: 80% of questions exact; Q5 ~67% accurate. Strict penalty for the key list error reduces from 10.0. JSON format, timestamps, etc., are flawless.
