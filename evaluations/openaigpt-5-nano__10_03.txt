### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer violates the prompt in multiple critical ways, leading to a very low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Addition of unauthorized activities**: The prompt explicitly forbids adding activities ("do not rename, merge, or add activities"). The LLM introduces four extra rows ("Compliance Officer approval", "Treasury Ops scheduling the payment", "Treasury Ops releasing the funds", "Treasury Ops notifying the originating analyst") not present in the ground truth or strictly mandated. While the ground truth infers some post-scoring steps, the LLM over-expands and splits them unnecessarily, creating a matrix with 8 activities instead of 6. This alone warrants severe deduction.

- **Inaccurate RACI assignments**: Numerous differences from ground truth, even for core activities:
  - **Intake Vetting**: Compliance Officer is "I" (LLM) vs. "–" (ground truth, indicating no involvement).
  - **KYC Review**: Front-Office Analyst is "C" vs. "–"; Compliance Officer is "I" vs. "C".
  - **AML Screening**: Same as KYC—Front-Office "C" vs. "–"; Officer "I" vs. "C".
  - **Risk Scoring**: Compliance Analyst is "R, A" vs. "R" only; Officer is "I" vs. "A" (accountable for escalation decision).
  - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Front-Office is "C" vs. "I"; Treasury Ops is "I" vs. "–".
  - Added rows have no ground truth equivalent, so all assignments are extraneous errors.
  These are not minor; they misrepresent role responsibilities per the narrative (e.g., Officer should be accountable for scoring/escalation, consulted on screening).

- **Formatting and style deviations**:
  - No use of dashes ("–") for no involvement, as in ground truth—instead uses "I" incorrectly in several spots.
  - Missing bolding (**R, A**) for primary responsibilities, which ground truth uses for emphasis.
  - Activity names for extras are verbose and prefixed ("Treasury Ops ..."), unlike ground truth's concise "Compliance Officer Approval" and "Release Funds". Core names match policy (e.g., "Intake Vetting"), earning minimal credit, but no disallowed synonyms appear, so no further penalty there.
  - Table structure is mostly Markdown-compliant but lacks the aligned, padded formatting of ground truth (e.g., longer activity column).

- **Overall fidelity to narrative and policy**: The matrix covers roles but fails to "cover every activity ... described above" without addition or alteration. It uses authorized vocabulary for the four core terms exactly (positive), but the expansions and errors dilute accuracy. Small issues (e.g., "approval" lowercase vs. "Approval") compound with major ones, per strict instructions for significant point loss even on minor errors.

This results in a fundamentally flawed response—about 30-40% alignment at best with ground truth structure and content—hence the low score. A perfect match would be 10.0; here, violations dominate.
