The LLM answer correctly judges the fact as inaccurate and provides case-based evidence (Case 1001 and 1003) showing that “Update_Inventory” occurs before “Authorize_Refund” (not after as the claim suggests). It also correctly notes that the observed ordering contradicts the claim.

However, a strict evaluation reveals the following issues leading to point deductions:

- **Omission of Key Evidence:** The LLM answer does not mention Case 1002 at all, missing an important point: “Update_Inventory” does not even occur in that case. The ground truth appropriately highlights this as crucial evidence, since the claim of “always” is falsified if there is any case missing the activity in question.
- **Missed Explicit Refutation of "Always":** The LLM answer implies the "always" is inaccurate based on sequence, but doesn't explicitly note that in some cases “Update_Inventory” is absent entirely (Case 1002), which strongly refutes the claim.
- **Formatting and Clarity:** The justification could have more clearly referenced line numbers and explicitly named the missing activity for completeness (as the ground truth does).

For these reasons, despite having the correct verdict and generally good evidence, the response lacks completeness and misses a key falsifying detail, justifying a reduction in score.
