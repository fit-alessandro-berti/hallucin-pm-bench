The LLM answer correctly identifies the fact as inaccurate and provides accurate evidence from Cases 1001 and 1003, reversing the claimed order without speculation. However, it deducts points for not explicitly addressing Case 1002 (where `Update_Inventory` is absent, directly disproving the "always" claim) and for slightly less structured, comprehensive coverage of all cases as in the ground truth. The justification remains evidence-based and concise but omits a key counterexample, warranting a strict deduction.
