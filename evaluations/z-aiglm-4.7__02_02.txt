The LLM answer matches the ground truth exactly in factual content, sequence, distinct items, alphabetical order, and adherence to instructions (one per line for Q3). No extras, omissions, hallucinations, or errors detected. Minor formatting differences (e.g., bold headers vs. table, plain lines vs. Markdown bullets) do not affect precision.
