7.5

### Evaluation Breakdown:
- **Part 1 (Accuracy of Count)**: Perfect match to ground truth (exactly 1 occurrence, correctly identified). No deductions.
- **Part 2 (Explanation Quality)**: Solid on small sample size (3 cases) and potential for unrepresentative snippet, but misses key ground truth emphases like quantitative sampling error (e.g., 14 events, <2 hours, frequency swing from 0% to 7%, wide confidence intervals for rare events). Name variations example ("Manual Review") is impreciseâ€”ground truth highlights actual fraud-related synonyms ("Automatic Fraud Check", "Fraud Check (Automatic)") and strict vs. fuzzy matching risks. LLM introduces mild speculation on full-log prevalence and "unusually low" periods, slightly deviating from data-only focus. Explanation is concise (under 120 words) but less analytically rigorous, leading to a ~4-point deduction from 10 for these differences. Overall score averages the parts with strict weighting on fidelity to ground truth.
