**10.0**

The LLM answer is a perfect match to the ground truth. 

- Q1: Exact ("once" ≡ "1").
- Q2a/b: Numerics identical (2.08%, 8.33%); minor formatting (no space before %) is irrelevant.
- Q3: 68 words ≤100; fully satisfies criteria—(i) single occurrence explicitly stated, (ii) variance/instability via "unreliable duration/impact" & "overfit", (iii) over-generalisation via "overstate prevalence", "misestimate typical paths", "insufficient support". No inventions; data-only.
