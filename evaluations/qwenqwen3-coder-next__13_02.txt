**9.5**

The LLM answer is nearly perfect, with exact matches on Q1 (1 occurrence), Q2a (2.08%, with calculation), and Q2b (8.33%, with calculation). Minor formatting nit (no space before % vs. ground truth's "2.08 %"), but insignificant. Q3 is strong: ≤100 words (~72), mentions single occurrence (i), cautions over-generalization/need broader data (iii), and implies instability via overstating frequency/importance leading to flawed models. However, strict deduction (-0.5) for not explicitly noting variance/instability (e.g., no skew, noise, CIs, single-obs unreliability as in sample) and substituting "process models" for "performance analyses" (question-specified), shifting emphasis slightly from ground truth's stats focus. No invention, data-only.
