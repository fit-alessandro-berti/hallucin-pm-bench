10.0

The LLM answer is functionally and format-wise identical to the ground truth in all verifiable aspects required by the prompt (content, structure, headings verbatim, exact phrasing per instructions and example, no extras). The minor whitespace difference in the ground truth's second gateway line (extra alignment spaces) is not mandated by the prompt's example or rules (`Gateway_X: exclusive → parallel` uses single space) and does not constitute an error in the LLM output. Under strict evaluation, zero differences in required elements yield maximum score.
