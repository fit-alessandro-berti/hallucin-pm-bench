**3.5**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment)
- **Core correctness (partial credit)**: Correctly identifies "Yes" and provides the right minimal prefix sequence (T1 → T2b → T4 → T5) to fire T5 without T3 having fired, matching the enabling logic via shortcut (T2b skips pc).
- **Major errors (heavy deduction)**:
  - Factual inaccuracy: Claims sequence "achieves this state (marking `pc=1, pe=1`)", but actual state before T5 is `pd=1, pe=1` (pc=0). pc=1 + pe=1 does **not** enable T5 (requires pd+pe), making the description technically false/misleading.
  - Mismatch in description: Lists **4 transitions** but references a pre-T5 state (after 3); post-T5 is `pf=1` (pc=0).
- **Significant incompleteness (deduction)**:
  - No step-by-step markings (GT has precise ones after each transition).
  - Sequence stops at T5; does not include T3 (GT provides full minimal 〈T1,T2b,T4,T5,T6,T3〉 proving order with both firing).
  - No proof of minimality (GT proves lower bound of 4 for T5 + extras for T3 via feedback/T6 necessity).
  - Minimal "why it works" (GT explains shortcut, feedback loop, impossibility of shorter paths).
- **Style/format differences (minor deduction)**: Less structured, no verification of full reachability/post-T5 T3 enabling in sequence form.
- **Overall**: Correct conclusion/sequence core (~50% match), but errors + omissions create substantial differences from GT's precise, complete, verified answer. Strict policy applied: ~65% point loss for errors/incompleteness.
