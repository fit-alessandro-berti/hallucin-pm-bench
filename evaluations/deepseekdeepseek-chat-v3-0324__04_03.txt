3.5

### Evaluation Notes
- **Overall Correctness (Major Deduction)**: The LLM correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant ("No") and pinpoints the core violation (Rule 3: NA before RA). However, it fabricates violations for Rules 1 and 4, which are explicitly satisfied in the ground truth. This is a significant error, as it misrepresents the ruleset compliance and introduces false reasoning (e.g., claiming Rule 1 is violated despite QE preceding RA correctly; arguing Rule 4 is violated due to "premature NA" when the rule is purely positional and CC follows NA/VP as required).
- **Justification Accuracy**: Ground truth uses a structured table assessing each rule individually. LLM's justification conflates rules (e.g., injects Rule 3 into Rule 1's assessment), incorrectly labels satisfied rules as violated, and ends with a wrong summary of violated rules (1, 3, 4 vs. only 3). This shows poor rule-by-rule fidelity.
- **Strictness Applied**: Per instructions, these are not minorâ€”misclassifying multiple rules is a critical deviation, warranting heavy point loss (e.g., from a potential 10.0 baseline for correct overall answer, deduct ~6.5 for factual errors in assessments and reasoning). Minor positives (correct overall verdict and Rule 2/3 handling) add limited credit.
