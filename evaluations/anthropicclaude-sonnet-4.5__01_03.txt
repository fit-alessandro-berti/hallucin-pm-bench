7.0

### Evaluation Notes
- **Part (a)**: The summary captures both decision points accurately in substance, with rules closely matching the process description (e.g., the conditional skip logic and the 2/3 approval threshold). However, under strict evaluation, minor phrasing differences deduct points: unnecessary step numbering ("Step 4"), slight rewording ("otherwise it is performed" vs. "otherwise it proceeds to that review"), and less precise language for TriVote ("required approvals... are obtained" vs. "approvers... record 'Approve'"). No hallucinations, but not a verbatim match to ground truth. Score impact: -1.0 from perfect.
- **Part (b)**: The list is mostly correct in order and content, identifying all unique documents without extras or hallucinations. However, a clear and significant error: omission of "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct required document explicitly listed in step 8 (ground truth treats it separately from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7, resulting in 9 items total vs. LLM's 8). This is not a small error, as it undercounts a named document output, violating "all documents... in the order they first appear." Score impact: -2.0 from perfect, outweighing minor additions like step references.

Overall, the response is strong but penalized heavily for the omission in (b) per strict criteria.
