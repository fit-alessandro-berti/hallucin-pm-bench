4.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Assessment)

#### Part (a): Decision Points Summary
- **Ground Truth**: Identifies exactly two decision points: (1) the post-Tri-Color-Risk-Check conditional skip (precise rule: Low/Medium risk *and* ≤ €250,000 bypasses step 5), and (2) the TriVote gate (requires at least two "Approve" from the three specific roles).
- **LLM Answer Issues**:
  - Introduces four decision points, exceeding the ground truth by inventing two extraneous ones. This is a major hallucination/overinterpretation.
    - Item 1 ("Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome"): Incorrectly frames the risk assignment itself as a "decision point" rather than the conditional branch *after* it. The process description treats the check as an input step, not a gate/branch.
    - Item 4 ("Applicant Confirmation Step"): Fabricates a decision gate with "stalls or loops back (implied by requirement)," which is not described as conditional or a branch in the process; it's a linear request step. No such implication exists in the prompt.
  - Item 2: Mostly accurate rule but minor phrasing deviation (omits explicit "bypasses Manual-Underwriting-Review" for "skips... otherwise proceeds," and no emphasis on the exact threshold formatting like ground truth's bolding/italics).
  - Item 3: Close to ground truth but slight inaccuracy—says "at least two... to approve" vs. ground truth's "at least two... record 'Approve'" (misses the specific "record" language, implying a formal logging not captured).
- **Impact**: Core errors in identification (only 50% of items match; extras dilute accuracy) and additions violate strict fidelity to the process description. Significant point loss for hallucinations and incompleteness in structure/content.

#### Part (b): Documents List
- **Ground Truth**: Lists exactly nine documents in first-appearance order, distinguishing "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a separate required item (step 8) from the unsigned "Offer Sheet 77" (step 7). Includes all inputs/outputs without qualifiers like "conditional."
- **LLM Answer Issues**:
  - Lists only eight items, missing "Signed Offer Sheet 77" as a distinct document. Treats the signed version as identical to the prepared "Offer Sheet 77," collapsing two process stages into one—directly contradicts the prompt's separation (unsigned prepared in step 7; signed required in step 8 alongside ID Matrix Declaration).
  - Ordering is mostly correct up to the scorecards and Deck Memo but shifts post-Offer Sheet 77 due to the omission: ID Matrix Declaration becomes #7 (should be #8), Loan Dossier 2025 #8 (should be #9).
  - Minor positives: Correctly includes scorecards as separate inputs and notes Deck Memo's conditionality (though ground truth lists it unconditionally in sequence, as it first appears in step 5 regardless of branch).
  - No hallucinations (e.g., no KYC/AML inventions), but the omission is a critical fidelity error, as the signed document is explicitly named and required.
- **Impact**: Incomplete list (one key document missing) and resulting ordering inaccuracy represent a substantial deviation. Even small distinctions like "signed" vs. unsigned warrant significant deduction under strict rules.

#### Overall Score Justification
- Strengths: No policy-violating additions (e.g., no KYC hallucinations); core elements of the two real decision points and most documents are captured.
- Weaknesses: Major structural errors in (a) (extras/misclassifications) and factual omission in (b) make the response unreliable as a summary. Under utmost strictness, this equates to ~40-50% fidelity, penalized heavily for even nuanced misses like phrasing and distinctions.
- Final: 4.0 reflects partial accuracy with critical flaws preventing higher marks.
