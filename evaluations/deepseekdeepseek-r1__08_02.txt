The LLM answer correctly answers "Yes" to Question 1 and provides the exact minimal firing sequence as the ground truth (T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5), demonstrating T5 firing before T3 by avoiding T3 entirely. The explanation accurately describes the token flow (P2 retained while P5 produced) without errors, concisely within the word limit. Stylistic differences (e.g., no explicit markings) do not impact correctness, as they are not required.
