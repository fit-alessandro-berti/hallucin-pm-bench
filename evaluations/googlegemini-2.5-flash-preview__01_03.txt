8.0

**Evaluation:**

**a) Decision points**

- The LLM answer captures both decision points: the conditional branch after the risk check and the TriVote approval gate.
- The rules are stated accurately, although in point 2 ("determines whether the application proceeds after the reviews"), it would have been more precise to specify that "at least two of three must approve", as in the ground truth, rather than "any two ... suffice" (the wording could be a little tighter). However, the substance is correct.
- Minor deduction because the LLM in point 2 says, "The application passes if any two of the three required officers ... provide approval." The ground truth additionally clarifies the three explicit officer titles at this point and states, "the loan may advance only when at least two ... record 'Approve'," which is a bit more precise and emphasizes the minimum threshold required. This is only a small difference.
- Both points combine the essence of the rules from the process.

**b) Required documents**

- The document list is full and in correct order with correct titles. No hallucinations are present.
- The list matches the ground truth exactly.
- "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is separated from "Offer Sheet 77," which is correct per the process.
- The Scorecards are included as documents.

**Summary:**  
There is a very minor lack of precision in summarizing the TriVote step—the ground truth's language is tighter and more explicit about the threshold ("at least two of three..."), and a tad more explicit about the necessary officer titles in the decision gate. However, all major information is correct and precise; document order and naming are accurate. No steps or requirements are missing.

**Strict grading, per instructions:**  
- Small language imprecision in the decision point summary: −1.0
- No errors in documents: −0
- No hallucinations: −0
- No detail is missing, only minor wording issues.

**Final score:** 8.0
