8.0

### Evaluation Rationale:
The LLM answer correctly identifies the overall non-compliance and pinpoints the exact same violations (Rules 2 and 3) as the ground truth, with accurate citations to events and rule requirements. It also correctly affirms compliance for Rules 1, 4, and 5. The step-by-step structure adds clarity, and the final format adheres to the prompt's requirement for "Non-compliant" followed by numbered justifications citing relevant rules (though more concise than the ground truth's exhaustive per-rule breakdown).

However, under utmost strictness:
- **Minor but significant errors deducted points**: In Rule 3 analysis, the LLM miscalculates distance as "4 - 6 = 3" (arithmetically incorrect; likely a typo intending 10 - 6 = 4 or position-based distance=3 as per ground truth), despite correctly noting it's the 4th activity after and exceeding the limit (>2). This is a small factual inaccuracy in explanation.
- **Format deviation**: The ground truth provides a comprehensive numbered justification for *all* rules (satisfied or violated), while the LLM only numbers violations in the summary (omitting explicit affirmations for compliant rules in the final section). This makes it less thorough, though still responsive to the prompt.
- No other major differences; inclusion of Quality_Check optionality in Rule 2 is accurate and supplementary, not erroneous.

Overall, the answer is highly aligned (90%+ match in substance), but the calculation error and slightly abbreviated format warrant a deduction from a perfect 10.0.
