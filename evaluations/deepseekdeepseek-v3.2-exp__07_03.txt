The LLM answer correctly identifies all added and removed tasks, matching the required format of "id (name)". It also correctly captures one gateway type change. However, it omits the second verifiable gateway type change (Gateway_Payment: exclusive â†’ parallel), which is a significant factual error given the instruction to summarize *all* functional changes with utmost strictness. Minor formatting differences (e.g., lack of bullet points, which are not explicitly required but present in ground truth) contribute to a slight deduction, but the content omission dominates the loss.
