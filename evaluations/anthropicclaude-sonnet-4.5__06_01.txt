### Evaluation Notes (for transparency, not part of core response)
- **Correct elements (partial credit)**: The LLM correctly identifies the only two parallel pairs from Process B (Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines and Create_Documentation — Quality_Check). Within-pair alphabetical ordering is correct, and the format uses the specified "—" separator.
- **Major errors (significant deductions)**: 
  - Overall list is not in alphabetical order (starts with "Procure_Materials" [P] before "Create_Documentation" [C], reversing the ground truth order). This directly violates the prompt's explicit requirement for alphabetical ordering of the overall list, warranting a large penalty under strict evaluation rules.
  - Includes unrequested introductory text ("Based on **Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder** only..."), which deviates from the prompt's output format (straight list of pairs, one per line).
  - Lacks the explanatory *Rationale* section present in the ground truth, which justifies the pairs and confirms no others apply—omitting this reduces completeness against the ground truth.
  - Minor formatting mismatch: Ground truth shows alignment (e.g., extra spaces in the second pair for visual consistency), while LLM's spacing is less precise, but this is secondary to the above.
- **Strictness applied**: Even though the core pairs are accurate, the ordering error alone (a clear instruction violation) and deviations from ground truth structure result in substantial point loss (starting from 10.0, deduct ~6.0 total). No criminal/jailbreak issues apply here.
