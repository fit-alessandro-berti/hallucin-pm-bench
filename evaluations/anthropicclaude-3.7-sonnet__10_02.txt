3.5

### Evaluation Rationale
This score reflects a strict assessment with significant deductions for multiple deviations from the ground truth (GT), as even minor mismatches (e.g., wording, row structure, RACI assignments) warrant substantial point loss per the instructions. The LLM answer correctly adopts the mandated vocabulary ("KYC Review", "Regulatory Liaison", "Transaction Analyst") and covers all source tasks without omissions, earning baseline credit. However, it falls short in fidelity to the GT in key areas:

- **Structural Differences (Major Deduction: -3.0 points)**: 
  - Missing "Operations Manager" column, which is central to GT's RACI assignments (e.g., as "A" for nearly every task). This fundamentally alters the matrix, making ~70% of RACI entries non-matching.
  - 7 rows vs. GT's 6: Extra "Send SWIFT message" row (not present in GT, which folds this into "Release Payment"). This introduces unnecessary fragmentation not aligned with GT's consolidation.
  - Combined "R/A" notations in single cells vs. GT's separate, bolded single letters (e.g., **R** or **A**) in distinct columns—deviates from GT's precise formatting.

- **Content and Wording Mismatches (Moderate Deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Row labels differ: e.g., "Receive and log transfer instruction" vs. GT's concise "Receive Payment Instruction"; "Screen payment against sanctions list" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List"; "Archive case file" vs. "Archive Record". These are small but accumulate as strict errors.
  - No separate handling of sender/beneficiary in "KYC Review" row, though source implies it—GT omits but still matches source closely.

- **RACI Assignment Errors (Major Deduction: -1.0 point)**:
  - Inconsistent across nearly all rows due to missing column (e.g., GT assigns "A" to Operations Manager in 5/6 rows; LLM overloads "R/A" on Analyst or IT). Specific mismatches:
    - Receive: GT has C for IT (LLM has "-"); I for Liaison matches, but overall diverges.
    - Screen: GT has A for Liaison and I for Ops Mgr (LLM has C for Liaison, no Ops).
    - KYC Review: Matches C/R for Analyst/Liaison but misses A for Ops and I for IT (LLM has "-").
    - Approve: GT has C for Analyst (LLM has I); misses Ops A and IT I.
    - Release: Matches R/I/C broadly but misses Ops A; extra Send row has no GT equivalent.
    - Archive: GT has C for Analyst and A for Ops (LLM has "-" for Analyst, R/A for IT only).
  - No bolding or emphasis on R/A as in GT.

- **Minor Formatting/Extras (Minor Deduction: -0.5 points)**:
  - Added title ("# AtlasRemit...") and legend positioning not in GT.
  - Legend wording differs slightly (e.g., LLM's "performs the work" vs. GT's simple "Responsible"; uses "-" for empty vs. GT's blank cells).
  - GT includes a post-table note on vocabulary adherence, absent in LLM.

Overall similarity: ~40-50% (strong on mandated terms and core coverage, weak on structure/assignments). A 10.0 would require near-identical table, columns, rows, wording, and RACI; this is a partial match with critical gaps.
