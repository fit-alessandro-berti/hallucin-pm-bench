5.0

The LLM answer demonstrates partial adherence to the prompt but also contains significant errors and omissions, as compared to the ground truth. Here’s a breakdown:

**Positives:**
- The LLM uses the mandated vocabulary (“KYC Review”, “Regulatory Liaison”, “Transaction Analyst”) and never uses forbidden terms.
- Markdown formatting of the table is present.

**Major Issues:**
1. **Role Omission:** The “Operations Manager” role is entirely missing. In the ground truth, this role is Accountable (A) for multiple steps.
2. **Task Naming:** Some task descriptions do not align with the ground truth’s mandated wording. For example, “Receive and Log Transfer Instruction” differs from “Receive Payment Instruction,” “Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission” is not in the ground truth, "Archive Record" wording is different.
3. **Mapping Issues:** The LLM splits certain tasks from the source text differently (e.g., separates “Release Payment” and “Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission” when the ground truth treats IT as consulted, not responsible/accountable, for this step).
4. **Responsibility Attribution Errors:** The LLM often conflates Responsible and Accountable, giving both to the same individual for most steps, whereas the ground truth differentiates these roles more distinctly (for example, Transaction Analyst is R, Operations Manager is A).
5. **Consulted/Informed Omissions:** Some C/I relationships from the ground truth are omitted or misassigned. For example, the Consulted (C) assignments for IT Support are missed; many I assignments are incomplete.
6. **Task Count/Mapping:** The LLM expands the process into 7 tasks versus ground truth’s 6, sometimes combining or extending tasks inappropriately.

**Minor Issues:**
- The LLM presents an explanatory section before the table, which is acceptable, but not all elements use mandated titles and wording rigorously.
- The legend is clear, but some mapping to RACI categories is inconsistent with the strict mapping of the ground truth.

**Conclusion:** The answer is halfway correct: It observes the vocabulary mandate and the general table structure. However, it commits role omission, mapping inconsistencies, granularity differences, and misallocates several RACIs, as well as not matching the enforced step names.

**Strict grading justifies a 5.0**. A substantially lower score is avoided only because the core mandated vocabulary is used and the general table structure is present. If the vocabulary or formatting were incorrect, the score would be markedly lower.
