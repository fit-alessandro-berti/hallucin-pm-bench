2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates significantly from the ground truth in structure, content, and fidelity to the prompt's requirements, warranting a low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Roles**: The LLM uses only three roles (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, IT Support), omitting the critical "Operations Manager" present in the ground truth. This introduces a fundamental mismatch, as the ground truth distributes accountability (A) heavily to Operations Manager, altering the entire RACI logic. Even though the prompt mandates specific substitutions, the ground truth explicitly includes this role, and failure to match it is a major error (-2.0 points baseline penalty).

- **Tasks/Activities**: 
  - Seven tasks in LLM vs. six in ground truth, with an extraneous split of step 5 into "Release Payment" and "Ensure SWIFT Message Transmission." The ground truth merges release/SWIFT under one task ("Release Payment"), making the LLM's addition non-compliant and inflating the matrix unnecessarily (-1.5 points).
  - Task wording differences: e.g., "Receive and Log Transfer Instruction" vs. "Receive Payment Instruction" (omits "log" specificity); "Screen Payment Against Sanctions List" vs. "Screen Against Sanctions List" (extra "Payment"); "Archive Case File" vs. "Archive Record" (different phrasing, missing "case file" detail). "KYC Review" is correctly mandated and bolded in ground truth, but LLM's "Perform KYC Review" adds unnecessary verbiage (-0.8 points total for inconsistencies).

- **RACI Assignments**: Core mismatches across nearly all cells, undermining the matrix's purpose. Examples:
  - "Receive Payment Instruction": LLM (TA: R,A) vs. GT (TA: R; RL: I; OM: A; IT: C) – misses consultations/informing and shifts accountability incorrectly.
  - "Screen Against Sanctions List": LLM (TA: R,A; RL: I) vs. GT (TA: R; RL: A; OM: I; IT: C) – wrong A placement and misses IT consultation.
  - "KYC Review": LLM (TA: C; RL: R,A) vs. GT (TA: C; RL: R; OM: A; IT: I) – similar but misses OM A and IT I.
  - "Approve High-Risk Transactions": LLM (TA: I; RL: R,A) vs. GT (TA: C; RL: R; OM: A; IT: I) – TA role wrong (I vs. C).
  - "Release Payment": LLM (TA: R,A; RL: I; IT: I) vs. GT (TA: R; RL: I; OM: A; IT: C) – accountability and IT role mismatched.
  - No equivalent for LLM's extra SWIFT task in GT.
  - "Archive Record": LLM (TA: I; RL: I; IT: R,A) vs. GT (TA: C; RL: I; OM: A; IT: R) – TA wrong (I vs. C), misses OM A (-2.0 points for pervasive inaccuracies).

- **Structure and Formatting**:
  - LLM includes unnecessary introductory prose, role descriptions, and a header ("AtlasRemit: Cross-Border Payment Process RACI Matrix"), which the ground truth avoids for conciseness. Legend placement is similar but LLM's is more verbose.
  - Ground truth specifies "(mandated wording)" in the header and has notes on vocabulary compliance; LLM lacks these, failing to emphasize enforcement (-0.5 points).
  - Markdown table is functional in both, but LLM's empty cells are less explicit than GT's filled ones.

- **Vocabulary and Prompt Fidelity**: LLM correctly substitutes mandated terms (e.g., "KYC Review," "Transaction Analyst," "Regulatory Liaison") and avoids forbidden ones, earning partial credit (+1.0 point). However, it doesn't fully "cover every task" without additions/omissions matching the ground truth's exact mapping.

Overall, while the LLM captures the informal description's essence and mandated vocabulary, the deviations in roles, task count/wording, and RACI assignments create a substantially different matrix. Under utmost strictness, this reflects ~75% divergence, justifying the low score. Minor alignments (e.g., vocabulary) prevent a 1.0 floor.
