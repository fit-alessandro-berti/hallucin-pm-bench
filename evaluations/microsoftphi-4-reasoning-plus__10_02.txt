2.5

### Evaluation Rationale
Under utmost strictness, the LLM answer scores low due to substantial deviations from the ground truth in structure, content, roles, task coverage, RACI assignments, and presentation. Small errors (e.g., lack of legend, use of "R/A" shorthand instead of explicit **R**/**A** bolding, blank cells without explicit "N/A" or involvement) compound into major failures, as the ground truth emphasizes complete, clear mapping with no omissions or inventions.

#### Key Differences and Point Losses
- **Structure and Format (Severe Deduction: -4.0 points base, total impact -3.5)**: 
  - LLM output is a verbose, leaked internal monologue (e.g., "We are Phi. I see a conversational query...") rather than clean documentation. Ground truth is a direct, professional Markdown table with legend. LLM's table is incomplete (cuts off mid-explanation) and lacks a legend, bolding (e.g., **R**), or code block formatting.
  - LLM uses 7 rows with "R/A" shorthand and blanks; ground truth uses 6 rows with explicit **R**, **A**, **C**, **I** per cell, no blanks.

- **Roles (Severe Deduction: -2.5 points)**:
  - Ground truth includes "Operations Manager" as a key accountable role across tasks (e.g., **A** in nearly all rows). LLM omits this entirely, using only Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support—failing to infer or add oversight roles for accountability.
  - This leads to incomplete RACI distribution; ground truth spreads responsibilities (e.g., IT Support often "C" or "I"), while LLM isolates "R/A" to the primary doer and leaves others blank.

- **Task Coverage and Wording (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - LLM expands to 7 tasks, including a separate "Send SWIFT Message" (from informal step 5) and combined "Archive Case File & Notify Regulatory Liaison" (step 6). Ground truth condenses to 6 tasks, omitting explicit SWIFT (likely folded into "Release Payment" or ignored), rewording e.g., "Receive Payment Instruction" (omits "Log"), and "Archive Record" (combines archive/notify without "Notify Regulatory Liaison").
  - Minor wording mismatches: LLM uses "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction" (closer to informal text) vs. ground truth's "Receive Payment Instruction" (slight variation). LLM's extra row for SWIFT makes it over-granular, not matching ground truth's exact mapping. Both use mandated "KYC Review," but LLM separates "Approve High-Risk Transaction" fully, while ground truth treats it as distinct but tied to KYC.

- **RACI Assignments (Major Deduction: -2.0 points)**:
  - Assignments diverge completely. E.g.:
    - Ground truth: "Screen Against Sanctions List" has TA **R**, RL **A**, OM I, IT C (emphasizes oversight/consultation).
    - LLM: TA R/A only, others blank (no consultation/informing).
    - Ground truth: "KYC Review" has RL **R**, OM **A**, TA C, IT I.
    - LLM: RL R/A only, others blank (ignores TA consultation, IT informing).
    - Similar mismatches in all rows: Ground truth always assigns A to OM, C/I to others for cross-role involvement; LLM silos R/A to one role, ignoring broader consultations (e.g., no TA C in approval tasks, no RL I in release).
  - Small errors like blanks (implying no involvement) vs. ground truth's explicit I/C amplify this, as RACI requires full coverage of interactions.

- **Vocabulary and Fidelity to Prompt (Minor Deduction: -1.0 point)**:
  - Both adhere to mandated terms ("KYC Review," "Regulatory Liaison," "Transaction Analyst") without using forbidden ones (e.g., no "Payment Clerk," "CDD"). No omissions in mapping steps.
  - However, LLM's explanatory notes (e.g., "Explanation of the assignments") add unmandated text, while ground truth sticks to table + concise notes.

Overall, while LLM correctly uses vocabulary and attempts comprehensive coverage, the messy presentation, invented task granularity, missing oversight role, and mismatched assignments make it fundamentally non-equivalent. A perfect match would require identical roles, tasks, assignments, and polish—resulting in this low score.
