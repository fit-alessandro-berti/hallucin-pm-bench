5.0

**Justification:**

**Major Strengths:**
- The answer converts the informal steps into a RACI table using the mandated synonyms ("Transaction Analyst", "Regulatory Liaison", "KYC Review").
- The answer avoids banned terms (no "Payment Clerk", no "Customer Due Diligence", etc.).
- Markdown table structure is used.
- Task naming generally reflects the source process steps.

**Major Issues and Point Deductions:**

1. **Omission of “Operations Manager” (Major):**
   - The ground truth includes **Operations Manager** as a role with *Accountable* responsibilities across all steps.
   - The LLM answer omits this required role entirely, which is a serious process documentation error. In a RACI table for process governance, omitting the “A” role from almost all tasks is not acceptable.
   - -3 points

2. **Misassignment of R/A (Major):**
   - In the ground truth table, *Responsible* and *Accountable* are split between the performing individual and the oversight role; the LLM answer often marks a single role as both R/A for a task. For example:
     - “KYC Review” should have *Regulatory Liaison* as Responsible, and *Operations Manager* as Accountable, but the answer marks *Regulatory Liaison* as R/A, omitting “A” from the correct managerial role.
     - This error is consistent across nearly all activities. Lack of distinction between R/A in a RACI is a significant flaw for rigorous process controls.
   - -1.5 points

3. **Missed Consulted & Informed Assignments (Significant):**
   - The ground truth table consistently assigns *Consulted* or *Informed* for cross-functional communication (e.g. Transaction Analyst consulted on KYC Review, IT informed, etc.), ensuring every relevant party is reflected per task. The LLM answer mostly leaves “Consulted” and “Informed” empty or omits them.
   - This means the answer fails to convey full communication lines, which is crucial for process clarity.
   - -1 point

4. **Task Wording Deviations (Minor):**
   - Several tasks differ in title from the mandated wording in the ground truth (e.g., "Receive & Log Transfer Instruction" instead of "Receive Payment Instruction"). The ground truth’s wording is more concise and standardized.
   - -0.5 point

5. **Granularity and Task Mapping:**
   - The LLM answer has an extra row (“Approve High-Risk Transaction”), while the ground truth folds this into “KYC Review” and “Approve High-Risk,” but keeps overall steps matched. This is a minor deviation only.

**Summary Table of Errors:**
| Type         | Deduction |
|--------------|-----------|
| Missing Operations Manager | -3      |
| R/A assignments wrong     | -1.5    |
| Consult/Inform missing    | -1      |
| Wording differences       | -0.5    |
| Total                    | **-6**  |

**Final Score: 5.0/10**

**Conclusion:**  
The answer is structurally correct for a basic RACI and follows the vocabulary mandate, but **fails critically in rigor** due to the omission of the “Accountable” (Operations Manager) role, widespread omission of “Consulted” and “Informed” assignments, and not adhering strictly to the ground truth’s task labels and full matrix coverage. This would be a passable rough draft for internal use, but unacceptable as strict documentation in a regulated context.
