9.0

### Evaluation Rationale (Strict Line-by-Line Comparison):
- **Q1/A1**: LLM adds extra correct but unrequested list "(C001, C002, C003)" and descriptive header. Ground truth is solely "**3**". Extra elements violate "no extra" rule → significant deduction (-0.5).
- **Q2/A2**: Exact content match (ignoring markdown escaping of underscores, as both convey identical sequence). Perfect (+3.0).
- **Q3/A3**: Content and order perfect (alphabetical, distinct, one per line). However, missing exact formatting ("-" bullets + "<br>"). Plain lines differ from ground truth presentation → minor format error, penalized strictly (-0.5).
- **Overall Structure**: LLM uses bold Q-headers (helpful but divergent from ground truth table/A1-A3 format). No fabrications/hallucinations; all facts precise. Total: 10 - 1.0 = 9.0.
