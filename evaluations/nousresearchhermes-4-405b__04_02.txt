8.0

Rationale for scoring:

- **R1:** Correct status and accurate justification.  
- **R2:** Correct status and references right dates, but the logic is slightly off. The LLM says "Ship_Goods on 2025-03-05 exceeds 2-day limit from last approval (2025-03-04)". The last approval that should be counted, based on the ground truth, is the new Manager_Approval (2025-03-07), since a Change_Request occurred in between. The LLM answer misses the correct reference point for the "last required approval," which is a relatively significant detail.
- **R3:** Correct violation and accurate justification.  
- **R4:** Correct status and concise justification.
- **R5:** Correct status and a reasonable justification, though the LLM omits explicitly mentioning that Pay_Invoice also happened before the renewed approval, as ground truth does.
- **R6:** Correct status and justification.

- **Overall conclusion:** Matches ground truth.

**Major deduction:**  
The main error is in R2 justification: the LLM references the wrong approval event, leading to a partial misunderstanding of the ruleâ€™s application. There are minor omissions/less detail in R5 justification. All other elements are accurate.

Therefore, **2 points are deducted** for these (especially the R2 misinterpretation, which is significant), leading to a strict score of **8.0**.
