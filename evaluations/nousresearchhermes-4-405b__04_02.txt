### Evaluation Breakdown
- **Statuses**: All rule statuses (Compliant/Violated/Not Applicable) match the ground truth exactly (100% correct). Overall result matches.
- **Justifications** (evaluated strictly for accuracy, completeness, and ≤20-word limit; all under limit):
  - R1: Partial match. Mentions order but omits explicit reference to amount > €10,000 threshold, making it incomplete vs. ground truth. Minor deduction.
  - R2: Significant mismatch. Incorrectly identifies last approval as 03-04 (ignores impact of Change_Request requiring new approval per R5) and falsely claims >2 days (actual ~1 day from 03-04; true violation stems from Ship_Goods predating final 03-07 approval). Core reasoning flawed; major deduction.
  - R3: Exact match in facts and logic.
  - R4: Near-exact match; minor phrasing difference but equivalent.
  - R5: Close match. Captures essence (new approval needed before further steps like Ship_Goods) but omits Pay_Invoice as another pre-approval step mentioned in ground truth. Minor deduction.
  - R6: Exact match.
- **Format**: Follows prompt (list format with bolded statuses implied; no table required). No deduction.
- **Overall Strictness**: Perfect status alignment saves points, but substantive errors in R1 (incomplete) and especially R2 (misunderstands "last required approval" interplay with R5, wrong day calc) warrant significant loss per instructions. Ground truth emphasizes change's impact on approvals, which LLM misses for R2. Score reflects ~70% justification fidelity.
