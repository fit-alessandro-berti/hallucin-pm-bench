**10.0**

The LLM answer is essentially identical to the ground truth in core conclusion (cannot derive/compute the value due to absent timestamps/durations), structure (numbered response matching prompt), and reasoning (explicitly cites lack of temporal data and appropriately notes benchmark irrelevance). It is precise, concise, and adheres strictly to the system policy without fabrication or deviation. Minor phrasing variations (e.g., "derived" vs. "computed"; explicit benchmark exclusion) enhance clarity without introducing errors; ground truth's mention of "ordering information" is arguably less precise given the log's sequential presentation per case. No losses warranted under strict evaluation.
