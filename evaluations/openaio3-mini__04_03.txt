7.0

### Evaluation Notes
- **Overall Correctness**: The LLM correctly identifies the trace as non-compliant ("No") and pinpoints the key violation in Rule 3, aligning with the ground truth. The sequence analysis (event ordering) is accurate.
- **Strengths**: Covers all rules with references; correctly notes Rule 3 violation (NA before RA); acknowledges Rule 2 satisfaction and Rule 4 adherence.
- **Weaknesses (Strict Deductions)**:
  - Rule 1: Incorrectly labels as "partially met" despite full compliance (QE and RA occur once each, in order) – deducts 1.5 points for misrepresentation.
  - Rule 2: Omits explicit reference to "severity = High" (essential for why VP is required) – deducts 1.0 point for incomplete reasoning.
  - Rule 3: Justification is correct but less precise (doesn't emphasize "both QE and RA" explicitly, unlike ground truth) – deducts 0.5 points.
  - Rule 4: Omits note on "after VP, as required" (relevant due to high severity) – deducts 0.5 points.
  - Format: Bullet points vs. table is minor but less structured – deducts 0.5 points.
- **Total**: Starts at 10.0, deducts 4.0 for cumulative errors (strict policy applied; each inaccuracy impacts fidelity to ground truth).
