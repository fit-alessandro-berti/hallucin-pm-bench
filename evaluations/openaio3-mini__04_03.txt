The LLM answer is accurate overall, getting the compliance decision ("No") correct, and referencing every rule, with mostly correct justifications. However, compared to the ground truth, the following shortcomings result in point deductions:

- The LLM answer says, for Rule 1, "partially met," but Rule 1 is fully satisfied; "partially met" is an imprecise phrasing and could suggest some aspect is incorrect, though fully met is correct according to the ground truth.
- The justification for Rule 3 is slightly less precise than the ground truth: it says "Notify_Authorities ... occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review," but does not explicitly mention that NA must wait for both QE *and* RA to be complete (the key detail).
- The LLM does not give a per-rule clear table or the distinct Green/Red checkmarks as in the ground truth, which is helpful for clarity. The justification is less structured and visually clear.

Overall, the answer is mostly correct, but minor precision, structural, and clarity issues (especially in explanation and terminology) warrant a significant deduction.
