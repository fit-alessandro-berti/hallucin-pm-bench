**1.0**

### Evaluation Rationale (strict assessment):
- **Major violations of task constraints**: Adds entirely new elements (`Escalation_01`, new flows `Flow_06b`, `Flow_06b_alt`) not present, including what appears to be a new escalation event/resource, breaching "without adding any new activities" (ground truth reuses existing `Activity_AMReview`).
- **Invalid/wrong BPMN XML**: `<bpmn:escalation>` is a global escalation definition, not an event; malformed tags (spaces in `< bpmn:...`, mismatched `>`); nonsensical condition `timedelta('PT48H') &lt; generateTimestamp()` (non-standard BPMN functions, wrong logic—checks *from VerifyID start*, not "within 48h of finishing Verify Identity", skips `CreateAccount` entirely).
- **Incorrect SLA enforcement**: Path from `VerifyID` → escalation → `End_Rejected` prematurely rejects without attempting `CreateAccount` or escalation review; ignores existing unused `Activity_AMReview`; no timer mechanism (boundary/timer event absent).
- **Missing required output**: No one-sentence justification (task mandates it); no explanatory comments like ground truth.
- **No alignment with ground truth**: Fundamentally different approach (conditional flow vs. interrupting boundary timer routed to existing task); all elements diverge, zero reuse of model's structure/SLA intent.

Zero matches, multiple critical errors → minimum score.
