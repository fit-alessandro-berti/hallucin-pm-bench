**10.0**

The LLM answer is semantically identical to the ground truth in content, correctness, and conciseness. All facts match exactly (3 cases with correct IDs, correct preceding activity verified chronologically for C456, correct unique activity). Minor formatting differences (e.g., bold labels paraphrasing questions vs. **A1:**/**A2:**/**A3:**, backticks vs. escaped underscores/parentheses) do not constitute errors under the prompt's requirements for bullet-point answers, as they preserve readability and do not alter meaning. No factual, logical, or structural deviations.
