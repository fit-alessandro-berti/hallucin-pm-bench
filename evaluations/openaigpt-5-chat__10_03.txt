6.0

**Evaluation:**

**Vocabulary Compliance:**  
- The LLM answer uses the mandated vocabulary for the activities (Intake Vetting, KYC Review, AML Screening, Risk Scoring). No restricted synonyms leak through.

**Activity Set:**  
- "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst" are added activities not present in the ground truth, while "Release Funds" is split from "Schedule Payment." The ground truth merges scheduling and releasing funds as "Release Funds" only.
- The ground truth has 6 activities; the LLM answer lists 8, introducing unnecessary granularity contrary to instructions ("do not rename, merge, or add activities").

**RACI Assignments:**  
- Several RACI assignments differ from the ground truth and contain significant errors:
   - "Intake Vetting": LLM marks Front-Office Analyst as R only (should be R, A), and gives Treasury Ops "I" (correct), but omits C for Compliance Analyst.
   - "KYC Review": LLM assigns R to Compliance Analyst—but A is missing. Should be R, A. Compliance Officer is C (correct). Treasury Ops as I (correct).
   - "AML Screening": Same issue—R but not A for Compliance Analyst, omits A. Compliance Officer is C (correct). Treasury Ops as I (correct).
   - "Risk Scoring": LLM gives R to Compliance Analyst and C to Compliance Officer (should be A for Officer). C to Front-Office Analyst (should be C). "A" is missing for Officer.
   - "Compliance Officer Approval": LLM gives both A/R to Compliance Officer, C to Compliance Analyst (ok), but omits I for Front-Office Analyst. Should be I for FOA, C for CA, R,A for CO, dash for Treasury.
   - "Release Funds": LLM assigns A/R to Treasury Ops (correct), but omits C for CA and CO, and I for Front-Office Analyst.

**Formatting/Notation:**  
- The ground truth uses "R, A" when the same role is both responsible and accountable, and uses a dash “–” for no involvement. The LLM answer uses "A/R" and leaves blanks, which is not strictly the same.
- The explanation at the end, while useful, is not asked for and offers a diagram, which is discouraged by instructions.

**Summary of Errors for Grade Justification:**  
- Unnecessary splitting/adding of activities (not allowed), which distorts the process.
- Several missing Accountable (A) assignments where required.
- Slightly different table notation and use of "A/R" instead of "R, A".
- Minor formatting issues (e.g., blank cells instead of dashes).
- The legend and offer for a diagram are not requested and slightly clutter the required output.

**Conclusion:**  
Given these notable discrepancies in activity structure and assignment of responsibilities/accountability, as well as the notational misalignment, a **6.0** reflects considerable effort and some comprehension, but significant non-trivial errors in both content and precision. According to the instruction to be "utmost strict," more than minor penalties are applied for each deviation.
