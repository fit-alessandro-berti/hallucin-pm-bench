1.5

### Evaluation Rationale
The LLM answer deviates substantially from the ground truth in multiple critical ways, warranting a very low score under strict criteria. Key issues include:

- **Extra content beyond the matrix**: The response includes unsolicited introductory text ("Got it — I’ll rewrite..."), a legend, and an offer for a "directional flow diagram." The prompt specifies returning *only* the Markdown table, with no additional explanations or additions. This alone is a major violation.

- **Added and improperly handled activities**: The prompt requires covering *every activity described* without renaming, merging, or *adding* activities. The LLM adds "Schedule Payment" and "Notify Originating Analyst" as distinct rows, which are not explicitly separate activities in the narrative (the ground truth omits them, treating "release funds" as encompassing execution). "Compliance Officer Approval" appears in both but is handled differently. This inflates the matrix and violates the "do not add" rule.

- **Vocabulary adherence**: Correctly uses the four mandated terms ("Intake Vetting," "KYC Review," "AML Screening," "Risk Scoring") without synonyms or leaks, which is a minor positive. However, added activities use unauthorized phrasing (e.g., "Compliance Officer Approval" is not one of the four core terms and isn't directly mandated).

- **RACI assignments and format errors** (significant differences across all rows, even where activities overlap):
  - Uses blanks instead of dashes (–) for no involvement, inconsistent with ground truth.
  - Incorrect combinations (e.g., "A/R" vs. "R,A" or single roles; misses multi-role assignments).
  - Specific mismatches (all rows differ):
    - **Intake Vetting**: Misses Front-Office as A and Compliance as C; overly simplistic (only Front R, Treasury I).
    - **KYC Review**: Misses Compliance as A (R only, vs. ground truth R,A).
    - **AML Screening**: Identical issue to KYC (R only vs. R,A for Compliance).
    - **Risk Scoring**: Misses Front as C; Officer as C (vs. A); no Officer accountability.
    - **Compliance Officer Approval**: Misses Front as I; incorrectly includes Treasury as I (vs. –); partial overlap on Compliance C and Officer but formatted differently.
    - **Release Funds**: Completely wrong—misses Front I, Compliance C, Officer C; only Treasury A/R (vs. R,A with consultations).
    - Added rows ("Schedule Payment," "Notify Originating Analyst") have no ground truth equivalent, making them extraneous errors.

- **Overall completeness and fidelity**: The matrix covers the roles but fails to accurately reflect the process narrative's flow (e.g., escalation logic, notifications). With ~70% of cells differing (including additions/omissions), and structural violations, this is a poor match. Small errors (e.g., missing commas in R,A) compound to major failures in strict evaluation. A score above 2.0 would understate the discrepancies.
