9.0

**Rationale:**  
- **Correct ranking:** The LLM answer accurately selects and orders the three worst activities by average waiting time, quoting both average and 95th-percentile waiting times correctly for each—matching the ground truth for #1, #2, and #3.
- **No unwarranted content:** The memo avoids mentioning other activities or non-waiting time metrics, complying with the instructions.
- **Action relevance:** All three actions are plausible, directly target waiting-time reduction, and are data-driven. However, compared to the ground truth:
    - For #2 (Send_Closure_Letter), the action is more generic—"batch processing" vs. the ground truth's "same-day e-signature letters"—and doesn't specify digitalization or same-day turnaround, making it less concrete and a bit less targeted.
    - For #3 (Assess_Liability), "AI triage" is a reasonable proxy for "rules-engine pre-classification," but doesn't strongly emphasize bypassing the senior adjuster queue for simple cases—a subtle but meaningful difference in action targeting.
    - For #1, the action very closely matches the ground truth in both concept and detail.
- **Minor omissions:** The LLM answer lacks specific pilot or quantitative evidence (e.g. "pilot test shows ≥25%" reduction) and doesn't quote reduction percentages per action, merely stating all actions "target ≥20%" in a generic postscript.
- **Format:** Word count is under 150 and style fits an executive memo.

**Strict penalty:** Because the differences are mostly in the precision and concreteness of proposed actions (especially for #2 and #3) and lack individualized benefit estimates, these small but real deviations cost a whole point. The answer is strong and closely aligned but not flawless.
