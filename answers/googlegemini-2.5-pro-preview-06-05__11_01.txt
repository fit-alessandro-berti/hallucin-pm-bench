**SUBJECT:** Urgent Actions to Reduce Top 3 Process Waiting Times

This analysis identifies the three activities causing the most significant delays in our claims process. Focusing on these bottlenecks provides the greatest opportunity to improve cycle time and customer satisfaction.

The worst-performing activities, ranked by average waiting time, are:

1.  **Request Documents** (Avg: 36.5h, 95p: 120.0h)
    *   **Action:** Launch a customer self-service portal for instant document uploads. This eliminates the manual follow-up queue.

2.  **Send Closure Letter** (Avg: 12.2h, 95p: 44.0h)
    *   **Action:** Fully automate letter generation and sending, triggered immediately upon case resolution, to remove batch-processing delays.

3.  **Assess Liability** (Avg: 7.8h, 95p: 16.4h)
    *   **Action:** Implement skill-based routing to automatically assign low-complexity claims to junior assessors, freeing up senior expert queues.

Each targeted action is projected to cut its respective waiting time by over 20%.
