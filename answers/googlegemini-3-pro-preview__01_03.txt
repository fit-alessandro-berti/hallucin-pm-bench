Based on the specific process definition for Acme Bank’s small-business loans, here are the summaries of the decision points and the chronological list of documents.

### a) Decision Points and Rules

There are two distinct logic gates in the workflow:

1.  **The Underwriting Bypass Branch (Step 4)**
    The logic dictates that the **Manual-Underwriting-Review** is skipped *only* if the risk rating is "Low" or "Medium" **AND** the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less.
2.  **The "TriVote" Approval Gate (Step 6)**
    The application is approved for an offer if **at least two** out of the three mandatory voters (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) vote in favor.
