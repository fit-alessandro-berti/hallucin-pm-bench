1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.  
2. The total number of logged events is 18. "Manual_Fraud_Check" represents $$1/18 \approx 5.56\%$$ of all logged events.  
3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.  
4. Two reasons the estimate is unreliable:  
   - **Small sample size**: Only 1 occurrence in 18 logs makes extrapolation unstable.  
   - **Non-representative sampling**: The data fragment covers just 4 cases over 5 hours, likely missing peak periods/behavioral variations.
