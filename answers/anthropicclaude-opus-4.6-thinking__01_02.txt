# Acme Bank — Micro-loan Fast-Track: Decision Points & Required Documents

---

## Decision Points

The process contains **two** explicit decision points (gates):

### 1. Underwriter Alignment Gate (after Step 4)

Following the **Dual Underwriter Split**, where **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B** each independently assign a risk score (0–9):

| Condition | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Scores differ by **≤ 2 points** | Continue directly to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** (Step 6). |
| Scores differ by **> 2 points** | Escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision, *then* continue to Step 6. |

### 2. Amount Threshold Decision (Step 7)

After the **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** (with at least 3 local references collected):

| Condition | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Amount **< €15 000** | System **auto-approves** → proceed to **Disburse Funds** (Step 9). |
| Amount **≥ €15 000** | Proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** (Step 8), where the board votes *approve* or *reject*. If approved → **Disburse Funds**. |

## Required Documents (at submission time)

1. **Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)**
2. **Proof of Address** (≤ 3 months old)

> **Key reminders:** There is **no credit-bureau pull** anywhere in this process. Risk assessment is performed solely through the **Dual Underwriter Split** (Senior Underwriter A + Shadow Underwriter B), and high-value approval authority sits with the **Micro-loan Board**, not the branch manager.
