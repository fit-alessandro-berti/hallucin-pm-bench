Our loan application process reveals three worst-performing activities based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting times: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment.  

Legal Approval exceeds its 600s Target SLA by 300s (Avg_Throughput_Time 900s) with 600s Avg_Waiting_Time across 465 cases. Risk Review exceeds its 300s Target SLA by 300s (Avg_Throughput_Time 600s) with 480s Avg_Waiting_Time across 480 cases. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240s Target SLA by 60s (Avg_Throughput_Time 300s) with 200s Avg_Waiting_Time across 1175 cases.  

These bottlenecks threaten overall throughput for 455 funded cases. Targeted actions:  
- **Legal Approval:** Assign additional reviewers to cut 600s waiting time, mirroring Draft Offer's 30s efficiency.  
- **Risk Review:** Implement parallel processing to halve 480s waiting time, targeting 300s SLA alignment.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Automate initial checks to reduce 200s waiting time, achieving 240s SLA.
