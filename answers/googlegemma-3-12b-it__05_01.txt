To ensure compliance with the 48-hour SLA for reaching "Task_Triage", I recommend adding a timer event after "Task_Check". We'll create a *composite event* with a timer intermediate event triggering after 48 hours and a message event.

Specifically, we'll add:

1.  A *timerIntermediateEvent* (let's call it "Timer_48Hours") after "Task_Check", configured to trigger after 48 hours.
2.  A *messageErrorEvent* after "Timer_48Hours", with an error boundary. This will invoke an escalation flow (not defined here, but outside the scope).
3.  A sequence flow (`f10`) connects "Task_Check" to "Timer_48Hours".
4.   A sequence flow (`f11`) from "Timer_48Hours" manages the escalation.



This triggers escalation if "Task_Triage" isn't reached within the SLA, without introducing new task elements.
