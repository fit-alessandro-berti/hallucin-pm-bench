**No**

Justification by rule:

- **Rule 1**: Violated. QE and RA must occur **once each and in that order**. Here, QE occurs before RA (correct order), but `Notify_Authorities` (NA) is executed *between* them, disrupting the required sequence. RA must follow QE directly without intervening activities that are not permitted. The sequence should be QE → RA → (other steps), but here it is QE → NA → RA, which violates the ordering constraint.

- **Rule 2**: Satisfied in timing but irrelevant due to prior violation. VP occurs after both QE and RA, which is required for high severity — however, since Rule 1 is already violated, compliance fails regardless.

- **Rule 3**: Violated. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs *before* `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), whereas the rule requires NA to happen only **after both QE and RA are complete**. Since RA comes after NA in the trace, this rule is broken.

- **Rule 4**: Satisfied conditionally — CC occurs after NA and VP — but this does not rescue overall compliance due to violations of Rules 1 and 3.

**Conclusion**: Multiple violations (Rules 1 & 3), so the trace is non-compliant.
