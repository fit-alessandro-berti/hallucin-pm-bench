Answer: No.

Justification: According to the event-log excerpt, there is one case (C004) where the activity "Check_Fraud" occurs in between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment". Here are the sequences for case C004:

- C004,Receive_Order,2025-01-03T10:05:00
- C004,Check_Fraud,2025-01-03T10:07:00
- C004,Validate_Payment,2025-01-03T10:20:00
- C004,Pack_Items,2025-01-03T10:45:00

Therefore, the fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log excerpt.
