**Question 1:** No.

**Question 2:** T5 requires token in P2 (•T5 ⊇ P2) and no token has been removed from P2 without firing T3 (•T3 = P2). Specifically:

- From M0 = {P0}, only T1 enabled → M1 = {P1,P2}.
- From M1, T2 → M2 = {P2,P3} (T5 disabled, missing P5).
- From M2, T7 → M3 = {P2,P4} (T5 disabled).
- Firing T3 required to remove P2-token.

T5 cannot fire while P2 holds its token; T3 must fire first to enable synchronization path to P5. No sequence allows T5 before T3.
