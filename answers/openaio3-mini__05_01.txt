Attach an interrupting boundary timer event to an existing task—in this case, Task_Check (“Check Completeness”). Set its timer definition to 48 hours counting from claim submission. If Task_Check isn’t completed within 48 hours, the timer event fires and re-routes the flow directly to Task_Triage (“Triage Claim”). This modification guarantees that every claim reaches Triage Claim within the SLA, even if Task_Check is delayed, without adding new tasks or subprocesses.
