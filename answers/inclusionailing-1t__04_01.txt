Non-compliant

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (at step 4), so *Risk_Assessment* **must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`**. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at step 8, and `Risk_Assessment` appears at step 9 — *after* shipping. This violates Rule 2.  
2. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (step 6), `Three_way_match` occurs at step 10. The distance is 3 activities (`Move_to_Quality`, `Ship_Goods`, `Risk_Assessment`) between steps 6 and 10, which exceeds the allowed maximum distance of ≤2 activities for the three-way match after goods receipt.  
3. **Rule 4 not violated**: Although an Intern activity (`Move_to_Quality`) directly follows a CFO activity (`Approve_PO_CFO`, step →7), they are separated by two other events (steps →4 and →5 executed by System), so no direct succession from CFO to Intern exists in the event sequence path relevant to this rule.  
4. Rules 1 and 5 are satisfied: PO amount > €10k received two approvals (Procurement_Officer then CFO) before `Issue_PO`; trace ends with `Archive_Record`.  
But due to violations of Rules **2** and **3**, the trace is non-compliant overall.
