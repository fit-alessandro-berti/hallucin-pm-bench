**1. No**

**2. Justification**

The fact claims that *“Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after ‘Receive_Order,’ with no other activities in between.”*  

The log shows two cases where this is **not** true:

- **Case C002** – Sequence:  
  `Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05)`  
  Here an activity (*Pack_Items*) intervenes between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*.

- **Case C004** – Sequence:  
  `Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20) → Pack_Items (10:45)`  
  Here *Check_Fraud* occurs between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*.

Because at least two cases (C002 and C004) violate the stated pattern, the claim that “Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order” is **incorrect** for this excerpt. (Only C001 and C003 follow that pattern.)
