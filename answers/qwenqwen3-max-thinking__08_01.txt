**Answer: No**, it is **not possible** for transition **T5 to fire before transition T3**.

### **Proof of Impossibility**

We analyze the structure and dependencies of the net:

- **Initial marking**:  
  \( M_0 = \{p0:1, p1:0, p2:0, p3:0, p4:0, p5:0, p6:0\} \)

- **T1** is the only enabled transition initially (it consumes the token from p0 and produces tokens in **p1** and **p2**).

After firing **T1**, we reach:
- \( M_1 = \{p1:1, p2:1\} \)

Now, **T2** (requires p1) and **T3** (requires p2) are **both enabled**.

- **T5** requires:
  - A **token in p3** (normal input arc from p3),
  - **Zero tokens in p4** (inhibitor arc from p4).

So to enable **T5**, we must have:
- \( p3 \geq 1 \)
- \( p4 = 0 \)

But **p3 gets a token only by firing T2**, and **p4 gets a token only by firing T3**.

Thus, to have \( p3 \geq 1 \), **T2 must fire**.

However, after T1 fires, **p2 = 1**, so **T3 is enabled immediately**, but **not yet fired**.

Could we fire **T2 first**, then **T5**, **before** ever firing **T3**?

Let’s try:

1. **T1** → \( p1=1, p2=1 \)
2. **T2** → consumes p1, produces p3 → \( p3=1, p2=1, p4=0 \)

Now the marking is: \( p2=1, p3=1, p4=0 \)

- **T5 is now enabled** (p3 ≥ 1, p4 = 0)
- **T3 is also enabled** (p2 = 1)

So **T5 *can* fire before T3 actually fires** — but wait! The question is: *“Is it possible for T5 to fire before T3?”*

This seems to suggest **yes**, but we must look more carefully.

Hold on: **T3 has not fired yet** in this scenario, and **T5 is enabled**. So can we just fire T5 now?

Yes — **if** the net allows non-deterministic choice, which Petri nets do.

So sequence:
- T1 → T2 → T5

This yields:
- After T1: p1=1, p2=1
- After T2: p3=1, p2=1
- After T5: consumes p3, produces p6 → p6=1, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0

**T3 has not fired** at all!

So **T5 fired before T3**.

But wait — is this **actually valid**?

Let’s double-check **T5's input arcs**:

> T5 : p3 –|p4 → p6  
> Normal arc from p3 (so consumes 1 token from p3)  
> Inhibitor arc from p4 (so requires p4 = 0)

At marking after T2:
- p3 = 1 → OK
- p4 = 0 → OK (since T3 hasn’t fired)

So **T5 is enabled**, and **T3 has not fired yet**.

Therefore, **T5 can fire before T3**.

But this **contradicts** our earlier "no" conclusion.

So which is correct?

Let’s re-read the question carefully:

> “Is it possible for transition T5 to fire *before* transition T3?”

That means: **Does there exist a reachable firing sequence where T5 occurs at a step prior to any occurrence of T3?**

From above: **Yes**.

Firing sequence: **T1 → T2 → T5**

In this sequence:
- T3 never fires (and certainly hasn’t fired before T5).

Thus, **T5 fires before T3**.

But wait — is there a hidden constraint?

Let’s verify token counts:

- Initial: p0=1
- T1: p0→p1+p2 → p1=1, p2=1
- T2: p1→p3 → p3=1, p2=1
- T5: p3 (consumed), inhibitor on p4 (p4=0) → p6=1

Final: p2=1 (unused), p6=1

This is a **valid reachable marking**.

Therefore, **YES**, it **is possible**.

But hold on! The original analysis suggested “no”, but detailed step-by-step shows “yes”.

So the correct answer is:

### ✅ **Yes**, it is possible.

**Concrete firing sequence**:  
**T1 → T2 → T5**

**Justification**:

- Start at initial marking: only T1 enabled.
- After **T1**: tokens in p1 and p2.
- Fire **T2**: moves token from p1 to p3. Now p3=1, p2=1, p4=0.
- At this point, **T5 is enabled** (p3 has a token, p4 is empty due to inhibitor arc).
- **T3 has not fired yet** (it’s enabled but not executed).
- Fire **T5**: consumes p3, produces p6.

Thus, **T5 fires before T3**, satisfying the condition.

✅ **Answer: Yes**.
