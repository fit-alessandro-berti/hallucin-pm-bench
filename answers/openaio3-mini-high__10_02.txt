Below is one interpretation of the RACI matrix for the AtlasRemit cross-border payment process. Note that the roles have been renamed per the mandate (using “Transaction Analyst” instead of payment clerk and “Regulatory Liaison” instead of compliance officer) and the KYC check is labeled as “KYC Review.”

The tasks have been broken out as follows:

1. Receive and log the transfer instruction.  
2. Screen the payment against the sanctions list.  
3. Perform the KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary.  
4. Approve high‐risk transactions (if flagged).  
5. Release the payment.  
6. Ensure the SWIFT message is sent.  
7. Archive the case file.  
8. Notify the Regulatory Liaison of the archived file.

Legend:  
• R = Responsible (does the work)  
• A = Accountable (owns the process)  
• I = Informed (kept updated)  
• “–” = No involvement

This matrix ensures that for each task the mandated vocabulary is used consistently and that responsibilities are clearly assigned across all roles in the process.
