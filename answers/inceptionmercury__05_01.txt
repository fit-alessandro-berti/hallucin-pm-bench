To ensure every claim reaches "Triage Claim" within 48 hours, introduce a timer event to the "Start_Claim" start event. This timer will trigger an auto-escalation path if the claim is not processed in time. Modify the sequence flow from "Start_Claim" to "Task_Receive" by adding a parallel branch with a timer event set for 48 hours. If the timer expires before reaching "Task_Triage," redirect the flow to a new exclusive gateway (e.g., "GW_AutoEscalate") that handles the auto-escalation logic, ensuring compliance with the SLA without adding new tasks.
