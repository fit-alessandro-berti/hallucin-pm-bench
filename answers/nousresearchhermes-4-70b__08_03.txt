Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3.

Here is one shortest firing sequence that achieves this:

  T1, T2b, T4, T5

Below is a summary of how the net marking evolves with each firing
(starting from the initial marking where p0=1 and all other places=0):

  • After T1 fires:
     – p0: 0  →  0 (1–1)
     – pa: 0  →  1
     – pb: 0  →  1

  • After T2b fires:
     – pa: 1  →  0 (1–1)
     – pd: 0  →  1

  • After T4 fires:
     – pb: 1  →  0 (1–1)
     – pe: 0  →  1

  • After T5 fires:
     – pd: 1  →  0 (1–1)
     – pe: 1  →  0 (1–1)
     – pf: 0  →  1

At the end of the firing sequence T1, T2b, T4, T5 the net marking is:
  pa=0, pb=0, pc=0, pd=0, pe=0, pf=1, and T3 has not yet fired.
Thus, T5 fired before T3.
  
This firing sequence is the shortest because all four transitions are required to put tokens in both pd and pe (the necessary input places for T5) without earlier firing of T3.
