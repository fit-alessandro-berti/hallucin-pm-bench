Non-compliant  

1. **Violation of Rule 2:** Since `Expedite_Flag` occurs (event #4), `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` is at event #8, while `Risk_Assessment` only occurs afterward at event #9, so Rule 2 is not satisfied.  

2. **Violation of Rule 3:** After `Goods_Received` at event #6, `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The next two activities are #7 `Move_to_Quality` and #8 `Ship_Goods`; `Three_way_match` occurs only at event #10, which is too late, violating Rule 3.  

3. **Rule 1 satisfied:** `PO_Amount` > €10 000, and there are two approvals before `Issue_PO`: #2 `Approve_PO` by Procurement_Officer and #3 `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO, both before #5 `Issue_PO`.  

4. **Rule 4 satisfied:** No activity executed by an Intern directly follows a CFO activity. The only CFO activity is #3, followed by #4 executed by System, not Intern.  

5. **Rule 5 satisfied:** The trace ends with `Archive_Record` at event #11 and contains no events after it.
