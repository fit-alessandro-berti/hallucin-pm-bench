**Summary of changes:**

**Added tasks:**
- Verify Identity
- Request Additional Documents
- Final Reject

**Removed tasks:**
- Reject Loan

**Gateway-type changes:**
- The gateway "Gateway_Decision" changed from an exclusive gateway to an inclusive gateway.

These changes reflect the addition of an identity verification step at the start of the process, the inclusion of a path for requesting additional documents during eligibility checking (enabled by the switch to an inclusive gateway), and restructuring how rejections are handled.

Thus, the final answer in Markdown and Latex would be:

```markdown
• Added tasks:
  - Verify Identity
  - Request Additional Documents
  - Final Reject

• Removed tasks:
  - Reject Loan

• Gateway-type changes:
  - Gateway "Gateway_Decision" changed from Exclusive to Inclusive.
```
