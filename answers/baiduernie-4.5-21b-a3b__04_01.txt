Non-compliant  
1. **Rule P2P-2025.R1 (multiple approvals):** The PO amount is €12,300 (exceeds €10,000), requiring two approvals. The trace includes `Approve_PO` by the Procurement Officer and `Approve_PO_CFO` by the CFO before `Issue_PO`, satisfying this rule.  
2. **Rule P2P-2025.R2 (optional activities after `Expedite_Flag`):** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` at timestamp 12:02. However, `Quality_Check` (activity 7) is executed by the **Intern**, violating the rule that its execution becomes optional but must occur after `Expedite_Flag` for this case.  
3. **Rule P2P-2025.R2 (Risk_Assessment timing):** `Risk_Assessment` (activity 9) occurs before `Ship_Goods` (activity 8), satisfying this rule.  
4. **Rule P2P-2025.R3 (3-way match timing):** `Three_way_match` (activity 10) occurs immediately after `Goods_Received` (activity 6), within 2 activities, complying with the rule.  
5. **Rule P2P-2025.R4 (CFO/Intern sequence):** `Intern` executes `Move_to_Quality` before `CFO` executes no activity in the trace, avoiding a forbidden "follow direct post-CFO" scenario.  
6. **Rule P2P-2025.R5 (termination):** The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (activity 11) and contains no subsequent activities, satisfying this rule.  

The trace fails **Rule P2P-2025.R2** due to `Quality_Check` being executed by an `Intern` after `Expedite_Flag` in this case.
