**No**

- **Rule 1** – Satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) and each appears exactly once.  
- **Rule 2** – Satisfied. Severity is “High”, and `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3** – **Violated**. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) is executed at position 4, **before** RA (position 5) is completed. NA must not occur until **both** QE and RA are finished.  
- **Rule 4** – Satisfied. `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after NA and after VP, as required.

Since rule 3 is not met, the trace is **not compliant** with the ruleset.
