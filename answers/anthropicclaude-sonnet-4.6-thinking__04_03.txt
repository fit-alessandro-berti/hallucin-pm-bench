### Rule-by-Rule Analysis

| Rule | Requirement | Trace Position | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | QE then RA, each exactly once | QE @ 3, RA @ 5 — correct order, each once | ✅ Satisfied |
| **R2** | VP after both QE and RA (severity = "High") | QE @ 3, RA @ 5, VP @ 6 — VP follows both | ✅ Satisfied |
| **R3** | NA only after **both** QE and RA complete | NA @ 4, but RA @ 5 — **NA fires before RA** | ❌ **Violated** |
| **R4** | CC only after NA (and VP, per R2) | CC @ 7, NA @ 4, VP @ 6 — CC follows both | ✅ Satisfied |

### Justification

The trace is **non-compliant** because of a **Rule 3 violation**:  
`Notify_Authorities` appears at step 4, immediately after `Quality_Engineer_Review` (step 3), but **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (step 5). Rule 3 explicitly prohibits NA from occurring until *both* QE and RA are complete. Notifying authorities before the Regulatory Affairs Review is finished is a direct breach of this sequencing requirement.

All other rules (R1, R2, R4) are individually satisfied, but the R3 violation alone renders the trace **non-compliant**.
