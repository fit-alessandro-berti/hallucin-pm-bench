Based on 12-month process data, the worst-performing activities by waiting time are:  

1. **Request_Documents**: Avg = 36.5 h, 95th %ile = 120.0 h  
   → **Action**: Automate document request triggers upon screening completion to eliminate manual initiation delays.  

2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg = 12.2 h, 95th %ile = 44.0 h  
   → **Action**: Integrate closure-letter generation into the approval/rejection workflow for immediate auto-scheduling.  

3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg = 7.8 h, 95th %ile = 16.4 h  
   → **Action**: Pre-load claim files with relevant policy and incident data before assessment begins to reduce pre-task setup time.  

Each action targets ≥20% waiting-time reduction by removing upstream handoff lags.
