**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   — Decision: Are the scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B within ±2 points?  
   — If YES → proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check.  
   — If NO → escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break; then proceed.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   — Decision: Is the requested loan amount ≥ €15 000?  
   — If NO (amount < €15 000) → auto-approve.  
   — If YES (amount ≥ €15 000) → proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval.

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**  
   — Decision: Micro-loan Board votes to approve or reject.  
   — Only triggered if amount ≥ €15 000.
