Of course. Focusing only on **Process B â€“ Warehouse_Replenishment**, here are the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently, listed in the order they appear in the process:

1.  **Set 1 (from Parallel Split #1):**
    *   `Quality_Check`
    *   `Update_Inventory`
    These two tasks are on parallel branches and can be executed at the same time after "Receive_Stock" and before the process can proceed to "Store_Items".

2.  **Set 2 (from Parallel Split #2):**
    *   `Generate_Replenishment_Report`
    *   `Notify_Procurement`
    These two tasks are on parallel branches and can be executed at the same time after "Store_Items" and before the process ends.
