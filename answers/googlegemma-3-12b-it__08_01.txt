No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. Here's a proof of impossibility:

**Proof:**

The critical observation is the inhibitor arc from p4 to T5. T5 is *only* enabled when p4 has zero tokens.  

1. **T3 fires:** For T3 to fire, p2 must have at least one token.  p2 receives a token from T1. In order for T1 to fire, p0 must have at least one token (and it does, initially). So, firing T1 leads to p2 having at least one token.
2. **p4 state:** Transition T3's output is p4. Therefore, once T3 fires, p4 will have at least one token.
3. **T5's enablement:** Because of the inhibitor arc, T5 requires p4 to have *zero* tokens to be enabled.  Once T3 fires, p4 has at least one token, meaning T5 *cannot* fire.

Therefore, T5 can never be enabled before T3, rendering it impossible for T5 to fire before T3.
