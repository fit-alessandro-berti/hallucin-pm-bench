## Verdict: **The fact is FALSE.**

The claim has the order exactly **backwards**, and it does not hold in any case in the log.

### Case-by-case evidence

| Case | Relevant sequence (timestamps) | What actually happens |
|------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **1001** | Update_Inventory (08:25:55) → Authorize_Refund (08:30:02) | **Update_Inventory precedes Authorize_Refund**, not the other way around. |
| **1002** | Authorize_Refund (10:18:40) — *no Update_Inventory present* | Update_Inventory is **absent** entirely; the claim cannot apply. |
| **1003** | Update_Inventory (10:08:07) → Quality_Check (10:15:42) → Authorize_Refund (10:22:18) | Again **Update_Inventory precedes Authorize_Refund**, and they are not even adjacent (Quality_Check sits between them). |

### Summary of failures
1. **Order is reversed**: In every case where both activities appear (1001, 1003), *Update_Inventory comes **before** Authorize_Refund*, which is the opposite of the claim.
2. **"Always immediately before" is also wrong**: In Case 1003, the two activities are separated by Quality_Check, so they are not adjacent.
3. **Universality fails**: Case 1002 contains no Update_Inventory at all, further undermining the "always" qualifier.

The fact is **not supported** by the event-log fragment on any of its three components (order, adjacency, or universality).
