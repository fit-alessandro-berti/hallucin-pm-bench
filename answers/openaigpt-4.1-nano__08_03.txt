Let's analyze the Petri net step-by-step based on the initial marking and the transition structure.

---

**Initial marking:**

- p0 = 1  
- All other places = 0

---

### Step 1: Enablements from the initial marking

- **T1**: Requires p0 (which has 1 token) → **enabled**  
- **T2**, **T2b**, **T3**, **T4**, **T5**, **T6**: not enabled initially, as their input places require tokens not present

**Fire T1:**

- consumes 1 token from p0  
- produces 1 token in pa and 1 token in pb

**Resulting marking:**

- p0 = 0  
- pa = 1  
- pb = 1  
- pc = 0  
- pd = 0  
- pe = 0  
- pf = 0

---

### Step 2: Now check which transitions are enabled from this marking

- T2: needs pa = 1 → **enabled**  
- T2b: needs pa = 1 → **enabled**  
- T4: needs pb = 1 → **enabled**  
- T3, T5, T6: not enabled yet

### Step 3: Determine the order of execution possibilities

Suppose we focus on T5: it requires **pd** and **pe**, and **pe** is only produced after T4, which needs pb. 

To have **T5** enabled, we need:

- pd ≥ 1 (via T2b or T3)  
- pe ≥ 1 (via T4)

---

### Path to enable T4 and T2b / T3:

- From current marking (pa=1, pb=1):

**Option A: fire T2**

- consumes pa=1, produces pc=1  
- **marking**:

  - p0=0  
  - pa=0  
  - pb=1  
  - pc=1  
  - pd=0  
  - pe=0  
  - pf=0

From here:

- T3 (needs pc=1): **enabled**  
- T2b: **not enabled** (since pa=0)  
- T4: **enabled** (needs pb=1)  
- T2: **not enabled** (pa=0)

**Suppose we fire T3:**

- consumes pc=1, produces pd=1 (wait, T3 requires pc=1 and outputs pd=1)

**Resulting marking:**

- p0=0  
- pa=0  
- pb=1  
- pc=0  
- pd=1 (via T3)  
- pe=0  
- pf=0

Now, with pd=1 and pb=1, the join T5 (pd, pe) is **not enabled** yet — pe=0.

Next:

- Fire T4 (requires pb=1):

  - consumes pb=1, produces pe=1

**Resulting marking:**

- p0=0  
- pa=0  
- pb=0  
- pc=0  
- pd=1  
- pe=1  
- pf=0

Finally:

- T5 (needs pd=1 and pe=1): **enabled** now.

- firing T5 produces pf=1 and consumes pd and pe.

---

### **Can T5 fire before T3?**

**Observation:**

- To fire T5, **pd ≥ 1** and **pe ≥ 1** are needed.
- pe=1 can only be produced by T4, which needs pb=1.
- **pb=1** is available immediately after T1 fires.
- To get **pd ≥ 1** before T3 has fired, there must be a path that produces pd without T3.

---

### Can pd be produced **before** T3?

- pd can be produced via T2b: input is pa=1, output is pd=1.

**From initial:**

- After T1: pa=1, pb=1
- Fire T2b (input pa=1):

  - consumes pa=1
  - produces pd=1

**Resulting marking:**

- p0=0
- pa=0
- pb=1
- pc=0
- pd=1
- pe=0
- pf=0

Now, **T5** requires pd=1 and pe=1.

- Since pe=0, **T5 cannot fire yet**

But **pe** can be produced only via T4:

- T4 needs pb=1 (available)
  
**Fire T4:**

- consumes pb=1
- produces pe=1

**Resulting marking:**

- p0=0
- pa=0
- pb=0
- pc=0
- pd=1
- pe=1
- pf=0

Now, **T5** is enabled and can fire **before** T3.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Yes, it **is possible** for **T5** to fire **before** T3 in a reachable marking.

### **Shortest sequence:**

1. **T1** (parallel split): p0=1 → pa=1, pb=1
2. **T2b**: pa=1 → pd=1 (pa=0 now)  
3. **T4**: pb=1 → pe=1

At this point:

- pd=1
- pe=1

**T5** is enabled and can fire before T3.

---

## **Final answer:**

**Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.**

**One shortest firing sequence:**

**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**
