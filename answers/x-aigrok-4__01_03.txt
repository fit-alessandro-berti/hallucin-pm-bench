Below is a complete and precise response to your query based on Acme Bank’s small-business loan-approval process as defined. I have adhered strictly to the provided process description, without adding, inferring, or incorporating external knowledge (e.g., no references to standard credit-analysis models).

### a) Summary of Every Decision Point
The process contains exactly two explicit decision points (one conditional branch and one approval gate). Each is summarized below with its rule described in one sentence.

1. **Step 4 Conditional Branch ("Skip Manual Underwriting")**: The manual underwriting review (step 5) is skipped if the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome is a Low or Medium risk rating and the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less; otherwise, manual underwriting is required.
2. **Step 6 Decision Gate ("TriVote")**: The loan proceeds if at least two of the three required approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) grant approval; otherwise, it does not proceed.

### b) List of All Documents
Below is a list of **all** unique documents that are required (i.e., explicitly mentioned as inputs, outputs, or deliverables) anywhere in the process. I have listed them in the exact order they first appear in the process description, without duplication (e.g., "Signed Offer Sheet 77" is a required signed variant of "Offer Sheet 77" but is not listed separately as a unique document). The step of first appearance is noted in parentheses for reference.

- Form 14B (step 1)
- Scorecard–Cyan (step 3)
- Scorecard–Magenta (step 3)
- Scorecard–Yellow (step 3)
- Deck Memo (step 5)
- Offer Sheet 77 (step 7)
- ID Matrix Declaration (step 8)
- Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9)
