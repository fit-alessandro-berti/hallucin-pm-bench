It is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking. Here's the explanation:

The initial marking has only place p0 with a token. For T5 to fire, it requires one token in each of places pd and pe. To have a token in pd, transition T2b or T3 must have fired, and for T3b to fire, transition T2 must have fired. Transition T2 requires a token from pa, which comes from transition T1, and T1 requires a token from p0.

The shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3 is not possible:

1. T1 (enables T2 and T2b)
2. T2b (enables T3 and T5)
3. T5 (but this is not possible, as T3 hasn't fired yet, and T3 is required to fire for a token to be in pd)

Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.
