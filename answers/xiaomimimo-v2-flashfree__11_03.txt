Orion’s COO – Process Performance Summary

We identified three activities that jointly breach SLAs and show high waiting time.

- Legal Approval: Average Throughput Time 900 s exceeds the 600 s SLA by 300 s; Waiting Time 600 s.
- Risk Review: Average Throughput Time 600 s exceeds the 300 s SLA by 300 s; Waiting Time 480 s.
- Verify Identity: Average Throughput Time 120 s exceeds the 90 s SLA by 30 s; Waiting Time 80 s.

Recommended actions, data-driven:
- Legal Approval: Prioritize cases by conditions to cut rework; target 300 s reduction to meet SLA.
- Risk Review: Allocate extra capacity to reduce queue; aim to halve Waiting Time to 240 s and meet SLA.
- Verify Identity: Add validation checks upstream and balance workload; reduce Waiting Time by ~40 s (30–50 s band).
