Let's analyze the XES event log fragment to answer each question.

### Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?
Looking at the case IDs in the log:
- C001
- C002
- C003

There are **3 distinct cases** (C001, C002, C003).

### Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).
Filter the log for case = "C002" and sort by timestamp (already in order in the given log):

Line 2: Receive_Order
Line 5: Check_Stock
Line 8: Arrange_Delivery
Line 10: Ship_Order

Sequence: **Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

### Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).
We need to find all events where the next event (for the same case) is "Ship_Order":

1. For case C001:
   - Event 7: "Ship_Order"
   - Preceding event: Line 3: "Check_Stock" (but this is not the immediate predecessor, since Line 3 is "Check_Stock" and Line 7 is "Ship_Order" with no intervening events for C001. Wait, no, Line 3 is "Check_Stock" and then Line 7 is "Ship_Order", so "Check_Stock" precedes "Ship_Order" for C001.
   Wait, let's see the sequence for C001:
     - Line 1: Receive_Order
     - Line 3: Check_Stock
     - Line 7: Ship_Order
   So the immediate predecessor of "Ship_Order" is "Check_Stock".

   Correction: The immediate predecessor is the event that comes directly before "Ship_Order" in the same case's timeline. For C001, the sequence is:
   1 (Receive_Order) → 3 (Check_Stock) → 7 (Ship_Order)
   So the immediate predecessor is Line 3: "Check_Stock"

2. For case C002:
   - Event 10: "Ship_Order"
   - Preceding event for C002: Line 8: "Arrange_Delivery"
   (Sequence for C002: Line 2, Line 5, Line 8, Line 10, so immediate predecessor is Line 8: "Arrange_Delivery")

3. For case C003:
   - Event 9: "Ship_Order"
   - Preceding event for C003: Line 6: "Check_Stock"
   (Sequence for C003: Line 4, Line 6, Line 9, so immediate predecessor is Line 6: "Check_Stock")

Now, list all distinct immediate predecessors:
1. Check_Stock (from C001)
2. Arrange_Delivery (from C002)
3. Check_Stock (from C003)

Distinct predecessors: "Arrange_Delivery", "Check_Stock"

Alphabetically ordered:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

Wait, but in case C001, the immediate predecessor is Line 3 ("Check_Stock"), which is correct (since Line 1 and Line 3 come before Line 7).
But let's double-check the immediate predecessors:
- For C001: events are Line 1 (Receive_Order), Line 3 (Check_Stock), Line 7 (Ship_Order). The immediate predecessor of Ship_Order is Check_Stock.
- For C002: events are Line 2 (Receive_Order), Line 5 (Check_Stock), Line 8 (Arrange_Delivery), Line 10 (Ship_Order). The immediate predecessor of Ship_Order is Arrange_Delivery.
- For C003: events are Line 4 (Receive_Order), Line 6 (Check_Stock), Line 9 (Ship_Order). The immediate predecessor of Ship_Order is Check_Stock.

So the distinct immediate predecessors are:
1. Arrange_Delivery
2. Check_Stock

Alphabetical order:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

But wait, the question asks for distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order". From above, we have:
- For C001: Check_Stock
- For C002: Arrange_Delivery
- For C003: Check_Stock

So the distinct activities are "Check_Stock" and "Arrange_Delivery". Alphabetically ordered, this would be:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

But let me verify if I missed anything. Are there any other instances of "Ship_Order" in the log? The events with "Ship_Order" are lines 7, 9, and 10. We've already accounted for all of them.

Thus, the distinct immediate predecessors are:
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock

But looking back at the log:

For C001: sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order. So immediately before Ship_Order (line 7) is line 3: Check_Stock.

For C002: sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order. So immediately before Ship_Order (line 10) is line 8: Arrange_Delivery.

For C003: sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order. So immediately before Ship_Order (line 9) is line 6: Check_Stock.

Thus the distinct immediate predecessors are: Arrange_Delivery and Check_Stock.

Alphabetically:
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock

But the question asks for "every distinct activity that immediately precedes 'Ship_Order'", which in this case are these two. However, "Arrange_Delivery" comes before "Check_Stock" alphabetically? Wait, alphabetical order is A before C, so "Arrange_Delivery" comes first.

So the answer would be:
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock

But let me confirm if "Arrange_Delivery" and "Check_Stock" are the only two. Yes, as we've seen.

Final answer for Q3 (one per line, alphabetically ordered):

Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock

### Answers:
Q1: 3
Q2: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
Q3:
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
