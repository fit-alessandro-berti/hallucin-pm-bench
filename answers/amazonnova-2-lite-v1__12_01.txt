### **Answer: The fact is inaccurate.**

---

### **Justification:**

The claim states that **“Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory”** within the same case.

#### **Analysis based on the provided log:**

Let’s examine the sequence of activities **within each case** to test the claim:

---

#### **Case 1001:**
Sequence of activities:
1. Receive_Return
2. Inspect_Item
3. **Update_Inventory**
4. **Authorize_Refund**
5. Refund_Issued  

➡️ Here, **“Update_Inventory” occurs *before* “Authorize_Refund.”**  
❌ This **contradicts** the claim that “Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately *before* “Update_Inventory.”

---

#### **Case 1002:**
Sequence of activities:
1. Receive_Return  
2. Inspect_Item  
3. **Authorize_Refund**  
4. Refund_Issued  

➡️ “Update_Inventory” **does not occur at all** in this case.  
❌ Since “Update_Inventory” is missing, we cannot satisfy the condition of “Authorize_Refund” occurring *immediately before* “Update_Inventory.” The claim says “always occurs immediately before,” but in this case, the required activity does not even happen.

---

#### **Case 1003:**
Sequence of activities:
1. Receive_Return  
2. Inspect_Item  
3. **Update_Inventory**  
4. **Quality_Check**  
5. **Authorize_Refund**  

➡️ Here, **“Update_Inventory” occurs *before* “Authorize_Refund,”** and there is an additional activity (“Quality_Check”) in between.  
❌ Again, this **contradicts** the claim.

---

### **Conclusion:**
The fact is **not accurate**. In **Case 1001**, “Update_Inventory” occurs *before* “Authorize_Refund”; in **Case 1002**, “Update_Inventory” is missing entirely; and in **Case 1003**, “Update_Inventory” occurs before “Authorize_Refund” with another activity in between.

Thus, **“Authorize_Refund” does *not* always occur immediately before “Update_Inventory”** in the same case.
