### Response to Task  

1. **Average Cycle Time of "Approve Invoice"**:  
   It is **impossible to compute** the average cycle time for the activity "Approve Invoice".  

2. **Standard Deviation and 95% Confidence Interval**:  
   Neither the standard deviation nor a 95% confidence interval can be computed.  

3. **Reason for Inability to Compute**:  
   The event log (Artefact A) contains no actual dataâ€”all rows and timestamp values (`start_time`, `complete_time`) are redacted. Cycle time calculation requires the time difference between `start_time` and `complete_time` for instances of "Approve Invoice". Without access to these timestamps, no time-based metrics can be derived. Artefact B provides aggregate process-level KPIs (e.g., time between activities) but no raw data for the activity's cycle time.  

**Conclusion**:  
All requested metrics are uncomputable due to the absence of timestamp data in the provided event log.
