Non-compliant.

1.  **Violation of Rule 2:** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), which mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must happen before `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at event #9.

2.  **Violation of Rule 3:** Activity `Goods_Received` occurs at event #6. The rule requires `Three_way_match` to be completed within the next two activities (i.e., at position #7 or #8). In the trace, `Three_way_match` is at position #10, which is a distance of 4 from `Goods_Received` and is outside the allowed window.
