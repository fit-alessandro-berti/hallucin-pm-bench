Let’s go through each question step by step.  

**1. Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
Looking at the log, `Manual_Fraud_Check` appears only once (Case A1002, 2025-05-01T10:50:00).  
Answer: **1**

**2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
Total events = 18 lines (excluding header).  
Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ 5.56%  
Answer: **5.56%**

**3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  
Only **A1002** contains this activity.  
Answer: **A1002**

**4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
Possible reasons:  

1. **Small sample size** — Only 4 cases are present, which is too few to generalize for a month’s activity.  
2. **Short time window** — All events are from a single day (2025-05-01), so it does not capture daily/weekly variations or monthly trends.  

Answer:  
- The data covers only one day, not a full month, so temporal patterns (e.g., weekly spikes) are unknown.  
- Only four cases are included, which is too small to estimate a monthly rate reliably.
