**Non-compliant**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1 (Two approvals before Issue_PO for PO > €10,000): ✓ COMPLIANT**
   - PO_Amount = €12,300 exceeds €10,000 threshold
   - Approve_PO by Procurement_Officer occurs at event #2
   - Approve_PO_CFO by CFO occurs at event #3
   - Both approvals occur before Issue_PO at event #5
   - Order is correct (Procurement Officer first, then CFO)

2. **Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag conditions): ✗ VIOLATED**
   - Expedite_Flag is present at event #4
   - Quality_Check is optional — no issue here
   - However, Risk_Assessment (event #9) must occur **before** the first Ship_Goods (event #8)
   - Risk_Assessment occurs at 10:31, but Ship_Goods occurs at 09:40
   - **Violation: Risk_Assessment occurs AFTER Ship_Goods**

3. **Rule 3 (Three_way_match within 2 activities after Goods_Received): ✗ VIOLATED**
   - Goods_Received occurs at event #6
   - The next two activities are: #7 (Move_to_Quality), #8 (Ship_Goods)
   - Three_way_match occurs at event #10 (distance = 4 activities after Goods_Received)
   - **Violation: Three_way_match is at distance 4, exceeding the allowed distance of ≤ 2**

4. **Rule 4 (No Intern directly after CFO): ✓ COMPLIANT**
   - CFO executes event #3 (Approve_PO_CFO)
   - Event #4 (Expedite_Flag) is executed by System, not Intern
   - No Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity

5. **Rule 5 (Trace must end with Archive_Record): ✓ COMPLIANT**
   - Archive_Record is the final activity at event #11
   - No activities follow it

**Summary:** Trace 24-EXP violates **Rule 2** (Risk_Assessment not before Ship_Goods) and **Rule 3** (Three_way_match not within 2 activities of Goods_Received).
