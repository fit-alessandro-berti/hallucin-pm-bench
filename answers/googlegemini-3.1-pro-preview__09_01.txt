**1) What is the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Review Contract” across all cases in the log above?**
The requested value cannot be derived.

**2) Briefly explain your calculation.**
To calculate the average cycle time of an activity, start and end timestamps (or pre-calculated elapsed-time/duration fields) are required for each event. As explicitly stated in the context, all timestamps and elapsed-time fields have been redacted from the provided event log dataset. Furthermore, the historical benchmark provided does not include metrics for the "Review Contract" activity, nor does it apply to the data in this specific log. Therefore, no mathematical calculation can be performed.
