**Answer: Yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3.

Here is one concrete firing sequence that achieves this:

1.  T1 : p0 → p1 + p2 (Marking becomes: **p1(1), p2(1)**, others 0)
2.  T2 : p1 → p3 (Marking becomes: **p3(1), p2(1)**, others 0)

At this point, T5 is enabled because it has a token in p3 and zero tokens in p4 (due to the inhibitor arc). T3 has not fired yet.

3.  T5 : p3 –|p4 → p6 (Marking becomes: **p6(1), p2(1)**, others 0)

Only after T3 fires does p4 get a token.

Therefore, in this sequence, **T5 fires before T3**.
