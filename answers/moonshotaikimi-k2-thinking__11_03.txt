To: COO, Orion Credit  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Subject: Action Required – Three Worst-Performing Activities  

Our data shows three activities that exceed SLA and have high waiting:

Risk Review – Throughput 600 s (SLA 300 s), +300 s; waiting 480 s.  
Legal Approval – Throughput 900 s (SLA 600 s), +300 s; waiting 600 s.  
Credit Assessment – Throughput 300 s (SLA 240 s), +60 s; waiting 200 s.  

Combined waiting for these three steps totals 1,280 s per case, driving overall cycle time beyond targets.  

Recommendations:  

• Add a second risk analyst to cut the 480 s waiting time and bring the 600 s throughput within the 300 s SLA.  

• Onboard an additional legal officer to reduce the 600 s waiting time and align the 900 s throughput with the 600 s SLA.  

• Deploy an automated credit‑scoring tool to trim throughput from 300 s to the 240 s SLA, lowering waiting time from 200 s.  

Await your direction.  

Sincerely,
