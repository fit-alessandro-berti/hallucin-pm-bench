No – The sequence violated in cases C003 and C005. For C003, line 6 shows *Validate_Payment* at 10:43 before the *Receive_Order* at line 7 (10:45). For C005, line 11 has *Validate_Payment* at 12:00 with no preceding *Receive_Order* for that case-id. Therefore, *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* in the log fragment.
