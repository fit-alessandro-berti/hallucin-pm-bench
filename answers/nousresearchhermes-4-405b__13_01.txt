1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs exactly **1** time in this fragment.  
2. In this fragment, “Manual_Fraud_Check” constitutes **5.56%** of all logged events. (Calculated as 1 occurrence / 18 total events, which yields approximately 0.0556 or 5.56%.)  
3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.  
4. Using only this fragment to estimate monthly manual fraud checks is unreliable for at least two sampling-related reasons:  

   • The sample is too small (only one occurrence), so the estimate may not reflect the true variability in frequency.  
   • The fragment covers only one day’s activity (May 1), so it does not capture natural day-of-week or month variations that might affect manual fraud check rates.  

   Other reasons (not strictly sampling-related) include that the data are limited to four cases, so they may not represent typical behavior regarding fraud-triggering events, and the short observation window (a single morning/afternoon) may miss longer-term trends or rare anomalies.
