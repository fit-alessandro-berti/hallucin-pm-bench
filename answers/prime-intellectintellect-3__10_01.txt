Here is the RACI matrix strictly adhering to the preferred terminology rules:

| Activity                | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
| :---------------------- | :------------------- | :---------------------- | :----------------- | :-------------- |
| **Receive Application** | A                    |                         |                    |                 |
| **KYC Review**          |                      | A                       |                    |                 |
| **Order Vetting**       | A                    |                         |                    |                 |
| **Payment Clearance**   |                      |                         | A                  |                 |
| **Record Update**       |                      |                         |                    | A               |
| **Notify Customer**     | A                    |                         |                    |                 |

**RACI Key:**  
**A** = Accountable (owns the activity)  
**R** = Responsible (performs the work)  
**C** = Consulted (provides input)  
**I** = Informed (receives updates)  

**Notes:**  
1.  **KYC Review** replaces the legacy term "Customer Due Diligence".  
2.  **Order Vetting** replaces the legacy term "Order Validation".  
3.  **Payment Clearance** replaces the legacy term "Payment Processing".  
4.  The matrix reflects the process description: each activity is assigned to the role explicitly responsible for its execution (Accountable). No forbidden terms are used.
