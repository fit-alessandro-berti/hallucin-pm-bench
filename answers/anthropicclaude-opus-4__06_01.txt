Looking at Process B (Manufacturing_WorkOrder), I need to identify all pairs of tasks that can execute in parallel according to the description.

From the process description, there are two explicit points where tasks run in parallel:

1. After Create_Work_Order: **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** run simultaneously
2. After Fabricate: **Quality_Check** and **Create_Documentation** begin in parallel

Therefore, the pairs of tasks that can execute in parallel are:

`Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check`
`Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines`
