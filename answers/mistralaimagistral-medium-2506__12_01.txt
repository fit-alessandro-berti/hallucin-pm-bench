No, the fact is **not accurate** based on the given event-log fragment. Here's why:

1. **Case 1001**: "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55, **before** "Authorize_Refund" at 08:30:02.
2. **Case 1002**: The "Update_Inventory" activity is absent (skipped), but "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 10:18:40 before "Refund_Issued."
3. **Case 1003**: "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, **before** "Authorize_Refund" at 10:22:18.

In none of the cases does "Authorize_Refund" occur immediately before "Update_Inventory." The fact contradicts the data.

**Conclusion**: The fact is **false**. The correct pattern is that "Update_Inventory" (when present) occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund." Cases 1001 and 1003 demonstrate this.
