**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1 violation**: The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000 and requires two approvals (Procurement Officer and CFO) **before** `Issue_PO`. While both approvals are present (events 2 and 3), they occur **after** `Expedite_Flag` (event 4) and **immediately before** `Issue_PO` (event 5). The rule mandates that both approvals must be completed **before** `Issue_PO`, but the trace shows `Issue_PO` occurs **after** the approvals, which is compliant in sequence but the rule's phrasing ("before") is strictly interpreted as the approvals must precede `Issue_PO` without intervening activities. However, the critical issue is the **order of `Expedite_Flag` and approvals**—the rule does not explicitly prohibit `Expedite_Flag` before approvals, but the approvals are not the **immediate** predecessors of `Issue_PO`, which could be interpreted as non-compliance. **Clarification**: The primary violation is that `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` (event 8), violating **Rule 2**, which requires `Risk_Assessment` **before** the first `Ship_Goods`.

2. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event 4), which mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods` (event 8). However, `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods`, violating the rule.

3. **Rule 3 compliance**: `Three_way_match` (event 10) occurs within two activities after `Goods_Received` (event 6), complying with the rule.

4. **Rule 4 compliance**: No activity by an **Intern** (event 7) directly follows an activity by the **CFO** (event 3). The intervening `Expedite_Flag` (event 4) and `Issue_PO` (event 5) break the sequence.

5. **Rule 5 compliance**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event 11) and contains no subsequent activities.
