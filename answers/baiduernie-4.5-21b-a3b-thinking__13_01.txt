1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** (for case A1002).  
2. This represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1 / 18 × 100 = 5.56%).  
3. The case identifier(s) containing **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** are **A1002**.  
4. Two sampling-related reasons for unreliability:  
   - The data is limited to a single day (2025-05-01), which may not capture the full range of daily variations in fraud check frequency.  
   - The sample only includes 4 cases (A1001–A1004), which may not represent the entire population of orders processed monthly, risking bias if other orders (e.g., higher-volume days or underrepresented cases) are excluded.
