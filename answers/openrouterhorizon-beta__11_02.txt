Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Key Performance Issues and Actions

Worst-performing activities

1) Request_Documents
- Why: Severe bottleneck. Lowest throughput drop (190 vs. ~270 upstream), extreme wait time (150 min), highest rework (22.0%), and elevated SLA breaches (5.5%). Indicates iteration and queue buildup.
- Action: Standardize document checklists and auto-reminders; introduce digital upload portal with validations to cut rework. Target: halve rework to ≤11% and reduce wait time by ≥50%.

2) Review_Documents
- Why: High processing time (25 min) with high variability (stdev 9), elevated wait (30 min), notable rework (5.3%), and highest SLA breach (12.4%). Signals complex/manual reviews and inconsistent execution.
- Action: Implement triage by claim complexity and a dual-screened checklist; use sampling-based QA instead of full re-reviews. Target: reduce stdev to ≤6 min and SLA breach to ≤6%.

3) Initial_Assessment
- Why: Early-stage delay (wait 18 min) and moderate processing time (12 min, stdev 4) with higher-than-peers rework (1.8%) and SLA breaches (3.2%). Early inefficiency cascades downstream.
- Action: Introduce skill-based routing and standardized assessment templates; prefetch policy/claim data to cut handling variance. Target: reduce wait to ≤10 min and SLA breach to ≤2%.
