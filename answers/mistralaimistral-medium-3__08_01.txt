Let's analyze the Petri net to determine whether transition T5 can fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking.

### Initial Marking:
- p0: 1
- p1: 0
- p2: 0
- p3: 0
- p4: 0
- p5: 0
- p6: 0

### Transitions:
1. T1: p0 → p1 + p2 (parallel split)
2. T2: p1 → p3
3. T3: p2 → p4
4. T4: p3 + p4 → p5 (synchronizing join)
5. T5: p3 –|p4 → p6 (inhibitor arc from p4)

### Goal:
Can T5 fire before T3 in any reachable marking?

### Analysis:
1. From the initial marking, only T1 is enabled (since p0 has 1 token).
   - Firing T1: p0 loses 1 token, p1 and p2 each gain 1 token.
   - New marking: p0: 0, p1: 1, p2: 1, p3: 0, p4: 0, p5: 0, p6: 0.

2. Now, T2 and T3 are enabled (since p1 and p2 each have 1 token).
   - T5 is not enabled yet because p3 has 0 tokens (T5 requires p3 to have at least 1 token and p4 to have 0 tokens).

3. For T5 to fire before T3, we would need to fire T2 first (to produce a token in p3) and then fire T5 before firing T3.
   - Fire T2: p1 loses 1 token, p3 gains 1 token.
     - New marking: p0: 0, p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 1, p4: 0, p5: 0, p6: 0.
   - Now, T3 and T5 are enabled:
     - T3: p2 → p4 (p2 has 1 token).
     - T5: p3 –|p4 → p6 (p3 has 1 token and p4 has 0 tokens).
   - If we fire T5 before T3:
     - Fire T5: p3 loses 1 token, p6 gains 1 token.
       - New marking: p0: 0, p1: 0, p2: 1, p3: 0, p4: 0, p5: 0, p6: 1.
     - Now, only T3 is enabled (p2 has 1 token).
       - Fire T3: p2 loses 1 token, p4 gains 1 token.
         - New marking: p0: 0, p1: 0, p2: 0, p3: 0, p4: 1, p5: 0, p6: 1.

### Conclusion:
Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3. Here is one such firing sequence:
1. T1 (p0 → p1 + p2)
2. T2 (p1 → p3)
3. T5 (p3 –|p4 → p6)
4. T3 (p2 → p4)

### Justification:
After firing T1 and T2, we reach a marking where p3 has 1 token and p4 has 0 tokens, enabling T5. Firing T5 before T3 is valid because T3 does not require p3 to have any tokens (it only requires p2 to have a token). Thus, T5 can fire before T3 in this sequence.
