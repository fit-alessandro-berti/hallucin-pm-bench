To create a RACI (Responsibility Assignment Matrix) matrix for the given process, we first need to map the process activities to the preferred terminology and then assign the appropriate RACI codes to each role for each activity.

1. Receive Application → Receive Application  
2. Customer Due Diligence → **KYC Review**  
3. Order Validation → **Order Vetting**  
4. Payment Processing → **Payment Clearance**  
5. Record Update → Record Update  
6. Notify Customer → Notify Customer  

The RACI codes are:
- **R**: Responsible - The person/role responsible for completing the task.
- **A**: Accountable - The person/role accountable for the outcome of the task.
- **C**: Consulted - The person/role consulted during the completion of the task.
- **I**: Informed - The person/role informed after the task is completed.

### RACI Matrix

|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application | **R**, **A**         |                         |                    |                 |
| **KYC Review**    |                      | **R**, **A**            |                    |                 |
| **Order Vetting** | **R**, **A**         |                         |                    |                 |
| **Payment Clearance** |                      |                         | **R**, **A**       |                 |
| Record Update     |                      |                         |                    | **R**, **A**    |
| Notify Customer   | **R**, **A**         |                         |                    |                 |

Here's a brief explanation for the assignments:
- **Receive Application**: The Account Manager is both responsible for receiving the application and accountable for its initial handling.
- **KYC Review**: The Compliance Officer is responsible and accountable as this is their task.

This RACI matrix adheres to the preferred terminology rules, using **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, and **Payment Clearance** as specified.
