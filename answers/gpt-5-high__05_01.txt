Add interrupting 48-hour timer boundary events to every pre‑triage task so the instance auto‑escalates to triage if still not reached by the deadline.

- Attach a timer boundary (interrupting) to Task_Receive, Task_Check, and Task_RequestDocs.
- Timer expression: timeDate = processStartTime(Start_Claim) + PT48H.
- Outgoing flow from each timer goes directly to Task_Triage.

Result: If 48 hours elapse after Claim Submitted and the token is anywhere before Task_Triage, the timer fires, skips remaining pre‑triage work, and moves to Triage (auto‑escalation), ensuring SLA without adding any tasks.
