Yes.

Concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:
- T1: p0 → p1 + p2  (marking: p1=1, p2=1, others 0)
- T2: p1 → p3        (marking: p3=1, p2=1, p4=0)
- T5: p3 –|p4 → p6   (enabled because p3=1 and p4=0; marking: p6=1, p2=1)

Thus T5 fires before T3. Brief justification: After T1 and T2, p3 holds a token while p4 is still 0 (since T3 hasn’t fired), so the inhibitor condition on p4 is satisfied and T5 can fire.
