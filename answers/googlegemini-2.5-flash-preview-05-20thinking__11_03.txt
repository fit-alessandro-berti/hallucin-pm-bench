Subject: Urgent Process Performance Review

This memo highlights critical bottlenecks in our loan application process, identified by significant SLA breaches and excessive waiting times. Addressing these areas is crucial for improving overall efficiency and customer experience.

The three worst-performing activities, based on both SLA breaches and high waiting times, are:

*   **Legal Approval:** Exceeds its SLA by 900 seconds.
    *   Increase capacity for Legal Approval to reduce the 600-second average waiting time.
*   **Risk Review:** Exceeds its SLA by 780 seconds.
    *   Re-evaluate resource allocation for Risk Review to alleviate the substantial 480-second average waiting time.
*   **Credit Assessment:** Exceeds its SLA by 260 seconds.
    *   Analyze upstream data accuracy for Credit Assessment to minimize the 200-second average waiting time.

Focusing efforts on these specific activities will yield the most impactful improvements.
