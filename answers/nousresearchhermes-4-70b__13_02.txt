1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt.  
2.  
   a) **Percentage of all events**: (1 ÷ 48) × 100 ≈ **2.08%**  
   b) **Percentage of all unique cases**: (1 ÷ 12) × 100 ≈ **8.33%**  
3. Low-support activities (e.g.… Manual_Fraud_Check) can mislead performance or predictive analyses when generalized because:  
*   they are rare—not representative of overall process behavior (likely exceptions/responding to high-risk claims).  
*   their infrequency may cause models to overfit if treated as a significant pattern.  
*   they may represent non-standard effort or delays that, if overgeneralized, distort average-cycle metrics (giving misleading AHT or bottleneck impressions).  
*   in prediction, they reduce model accuracy if assumed to reflect routine paths.  

Generalizing from such a slice risks ignoring process complexity and real-world unusual scenarios.
