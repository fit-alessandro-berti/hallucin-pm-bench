**1.** The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time (CaseID 1002).  

**2.** The excerpt shows 1 manual fraud check in 3 cases (33% frequency), suggesting high prevalence. However, this snippet may be unrepresentative: it includes a case requiring manual review (1002), which could indicate a bias toward complex/high-risk cases. In the full log, most cases might bypass manual checks entirely, making them rare. A small sample risks overestimating rarity or commonality. Analysts must validate against the full dataset.
