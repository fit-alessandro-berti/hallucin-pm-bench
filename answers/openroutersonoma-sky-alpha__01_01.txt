### Decision Points in Contoso’s Process

The process contains two decision points, both involving eligibility or branching based on specific criteria. These are summarized below:

1. **Eligibility Validation (after Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility)**: The triage agent checks the claim against the FlightManifest and WeatherReport to determine if the claim is eligible for further processing. (The process description does not specify outcomes for ineligible claims, but this check acts as a gatekeeper before proceeding to Finance_Controller_PreApprove.)

2. **High-Value Branch (after Finance_Controller_PreApprove)**: If the refund amount is greater than €1 000, the case branches to Senior_Auditor_Review (which must include the AuditTrail); otherwise, it proceeds directly to Process_Refund_Payment. (Per constraints, Process_Refund_Payment requires Finance_Controller_PreApprove to have succeeded, plus Senior_Auditor_Review for high-value claims.)
