Add an interrupting **Timer Boundary Event** (48 hours) to `Task_Receive`. Connect its outgoing sequence flow to an escalation path. This starts the SLA clock immediately after `Start_Claim`. If the timer fires, the process escalates instead of reaching `Task_Triage`. While a subprocess would better capture total duration, this boundary event is the optimal single change without new tasks. It ensures claims stalling during initial processing trigger escalation, satisfying the requirement to auto-escalate if `Task_Triage` is not reached within the window. This modification attaches directly to `Task_Receive` to monitor elapsed time from submission.
