**No.**

In this Petri net, P2 is a marked buffer post-split that feeds both T3 and T5. For T5 to fire, it requires tokens in both P2 and P5. The only way to obtain a token in P5 is for T4 to fire, which requires a token in P4. There are two distinct ways to produce a token in P4: T3 (from P2) and T7 (from P3). Crucially, T3 produces P4 *from* P2, while T5 consumes P2 *and* P5.

If T5 were to fire before T3, T5 would consume the token in P2. However, the token in P5 must have been generated by a preceding T4, which requires P4. Since P4 could not have been generated by T3 (if T3 hasn't fired), it must have been generated by T7. The T7 path is mutually exclusive from the T3 path (T2 consumes P1, leaving nothing for T3). Thus, if P4 exists via T7, T3 is structurally impossible to fire (as P2 was consumed by T5, and P1 was consumed by T2). You cannot satisfy the requirements for T5 (P2+P5) while preserving the option to later fire T3 (which requires P2 and is mutually exclusive with the path to P5).
