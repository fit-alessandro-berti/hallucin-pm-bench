1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.

2. There are 18 total events.  
   Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ **5.56%**

3. Case identifier(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”:  
   - **A1002**

4. Two sampling-related reasons the estimate is unreliable:

   1. **Very small sample size**: Only 18 events and 4 cases are observed; a single occurrence (or lack of it) can drastically change the estimated rate and is not statistically stable.
   2. **Unknown representativeness / sampling bias**: This fragment covers only a short time window on a single day for a few cases; there is no evidence that these cases or this time period are representative of the full month (e.g., day-of-week effects, promotions, seasonal spikes, different customer segments).
