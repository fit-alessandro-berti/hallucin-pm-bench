Non-compliant

1) Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag): When Expedite_Flag is present, Risk_Assessment must occur before the first Ship_Goods. In the trace, Ship_Goods occurs at step 8, while Risk_Assessment occurs later at step 9. This violates Rule 2.

2) Rule 3 (Three_way_match within 2 activities after Goods_Received): Goods_Received is at step 6; the next two activities are steps 7 and 8. Three_way_match occurs at step 10, which is three activities after step 6, exceeding the allowed distance. This violates Rule 3.

All other checked rules are satisfied:
- Rule 1: For PO_Amount â‚¬12,300, approvals by Procurement_Officer (step 2) and CFO (step 3) occur before Issue_PO (step 5).
- Rule 4: No Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity (step 3 is CFO; step 4 is System).
- Rule 5: Trace ends with Archive_Record (step 11) and nothing follows it.
