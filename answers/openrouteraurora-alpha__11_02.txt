**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process‑Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Q1‑2025 Claims Handling – Top Performance Gaps  

Three activities show the greatest performance gaps:

1. **Request_Documents** – Avg wait 150 min, rework 22 %, SLA breach 5.5 %. The extreme queue time and high repeat rate drive delays and cost.  
   *Action*: Deploy an automated document‑request portal with real‑time status tracking; pilot and monitor a 30 % reduction in wait and a 10 % drop in rework.

2. **Review_Documents** – Avg processing 25 min, SLA breach 12.4 %, rework 5.3 %. Long execution and frequent breaches indicate bottlenecks in review.  
   *Action*: Introduce a standardized checklist and a parallel‑review team; target processing <15 min and breach <5 %.

3. **Initial_Assessment** – Avg wait 18 min, SLA breach 3.2 %, rework 1.8 %. Wait time exceeds the next best activity and breach is above the overall average.  
   *Action*: Create a triage queue with dedicated assessors during peak periods; aim to cut wait to ≤10 min and breach to ≤2 %.

These actions are directly measurable and align with the observed metrics.
