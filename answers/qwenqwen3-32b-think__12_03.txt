1. **No**  
2. The fact is **not accurate** because:  
   - **C002** follows `Receive_Order` with `Pack_Items` (not `Validate_Payment`) before `Validate_Payment` later occurs.  
   - **C004** follows `Receive_Order` with `Check_Fraud` before `Validate_Payment`.  
   In both cases, `Validate_Payment` does **not immediately follow** `Receive_Order`, violating the stated rule.
