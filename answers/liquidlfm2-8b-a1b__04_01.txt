Non-compliant  
**Reason:**  
- PO amount (€12,300) > €10,000, so by Rule 1, it requires **two approvals** (already met, as PO_Amount → Approve_PO (Procurement Officer) → Approve_PO_CFO (CFO) — valid sequence).  
- However, Activity #7 (`Move_to_Quality` assigned to Intern) violates the rule in **Rule 4**:  
  No activity executed by **Intern** may directly follow an activity executed by **CFO**.  
  Here, CFO executed Approve_PO_CFO (activity #3), and Intern executed Move_to_Quality (activity #7), which directly follows CFO’s approval — this violates the policy.  
- Although Rule 5 is satisfied (record ends with Archive_Record and no activity afterward), the violation on activity sequence renders the entire trace non-compliant.
