**Memo**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Brief

Our Q1-2025 claims handling data reveals three critical performance bottlenecks requiring immediate attention:

1.  **Request_Documents:** This activity suffers from an extremely high average wait time (150 min) and a concerning 22% rework rate, substantially impacting throughput.
    *   *Action:* Implement clearer document requirement templates or automate initial document checks to reduce re-requests.

2.  **Review_Documents:** With the highest average processing time (25 min), highest variability (9 min std dev), and highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), this step is notably inefficient.
    *   *Action:* Standardize review protocols and provide targeted training to reduce processing time and variability.

3.  **Initial_Assessment:** Although less severe, this activity shows the first significant performance dip. It presents with noticeable wait times (18 min), processing times (12 min), and a 3.2% SLA breach rate.
    *   *Action:* Investigate root causes for queueing and processing delays to optimize initial data capture and flow.

Addressing these areas will significantly improve overall claims processing efficiency and customer satisfaction.
