Non-compliant  

1. **Violation of Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag / Risk_Assessment order)**  
   - The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event 4), so `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`.  
   - In the trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at event 9.  
   - This violates Rule 2, second bullet.

2. **Violation of Rule 3 (Three_way_match timing after Goods_Received)**  
   - `Goods_Received` occurs at event 6. Rule 3 requires `Three_way_match` to be completed **within the next two activities** (i.e., at event 7 or 8).  
   - `Three_way_match` occurs only at event 10, which is four steps after `Goods_Received`.  
   - This violates Rule 3.

3. **Other rules are satisfied but do not offset violations**  
   - Rule 1: Both required approvals (`Approve_PO` by Procurement_Officer at event 2 and `Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO at event 3) occur **before** `Issue_PO` (event 5) for a PO amount > €10 000 → compliant.  
   - Rule 4: No Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity (CFO at event 3 is followed by System at event 4) → compliant.  
   - Rule 5: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event 11) and nothing follows it → compliant.  

Because Rules 2 and 3 are violated, the overall trace is **Non-compliant** with P2P-2025.R1.
