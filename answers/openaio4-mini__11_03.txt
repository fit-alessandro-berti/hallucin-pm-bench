Analysis of our process metrics identifies the three worst-performing activities as Credit Assessment, Risk Review, and Legal Approval. Each exceeds its SLA while also exhibiting a disproportionately high average waiting time.

Credit Assessment currently records an average throughput time of 300 seconds, exceeding its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, with a 200-second average waiting time. Risk Review averages 600 seconds throughput against a 300-second SLA, breaching by 300 seconds and piling up a 480-second wait. Legal Approval runs at 900-second throughput, overshooting its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds and incurring 600-second waits.

Recommendations focus on rebalancing capacity to these bottlenecks:  
- For Credit Assessment: Increase assessor capacity by 25%, based on current volume (1,175 cases) to reduce average waiting below 150 seconds.  
- For Risk Review: Implement parallel review streams for 480 cases to cut average throughput by at least 50%, targeting 300 seconds.  
- For Legal Approval: Add a second full-time approver to split 465 cases and bring throughput under 600 seconds.
