### Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Refund Process

There is only **one explicit decision point** in the described process:

1. **High-value claim check** (implicit gateway after Finance_Controller_PreApprove)  
   - Decision criterion: Is the refund amount **greater than €1 000**?  
     - **Yes** → route the case to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (required before payment can be processed).  
     - **No** → proceed directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.

No other decision points or gateways exist in the process (in particular, there is no “CustomerService_Agent_Decide” activity or any other manual eligibility decision beyond the triage agent’s validation).

### All Required Documents/Artefacts (as defined)

- RefundRequestForm (completed by the passenger)
- FlightManifest (used by triage agent)
- WeatherReport (used by triage agent)
- EligibilityChecklist (signed off by finance controller)
- AuditTrail (required only for high-value claims > €1 000, reviewed by senior auditor)
- BankTransferAuthorization (must be signed before payment)
- RefundConfirmationPDF (emailed to the passenger at the end)

These are the only artefacts mentioned in Contoso’s actual process; no others may be assumed.
