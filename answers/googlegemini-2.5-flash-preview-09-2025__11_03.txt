**TO:** COO, Orion Credit
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Critical Bottlenecks and Performance Degradation in Credit Origination

Analysis identifies three activities critically underperforming against service levels (SLA) due to poor throughput and excessive waiting times, collectively processing 1175 cases or more. These activities require immediate attention to mitigate cycle time inflation.

The worst-performing activities, based jointly on SLA breaches and high waiting time:

*   **Legal Approval:** The activity's latency (1500s total, 600s waiting) exceeds the 600s SLA by 900 seconds.
    *   *Recommendation:* Allocate resources specifically to reduce the substantial 600-second average waiting time.
*   **Risk Review:** Processing time (1080s total, 480s waiting) exceeds the 300s SLA by 780 seconds.
    *   *Recommendation:* Implement a triage system for the 480 cases entering this step to reduce the average 480-second waiting time.
*   **Credit Assessment:** Time spent (500s total, 200s waiting) breaches the 240s SLA by 260 seconds.
    *   *Recommendation:* Investigate the root cause of the 200-second waiting time affecting 1175 cases to streamline workflow input.
