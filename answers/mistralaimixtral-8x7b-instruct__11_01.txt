Subject: Identifying and Addressing Top Three Delays in Claims Processing

Dear COO,

An analysis of the past twelve months' data reveals the top three activities contributing to waiting times:

1. **Request_Documents** (Avg: 36.5 h, 95p: 120.0 h) - With an average waiting time over 36 hours, this activity significantly impacts claim processing. A data-driven action is to implement an online document submission system, which could reduce waiting times by up to 20%.

2. **Initial_Screening** (Avg: 2.1 h, 95p: 5.6 h) - This step has considerable variability in waiting times. Introducing standardized criteria for initial screening can reduce average waiting time by 20%.

3. **Assess_Liability** (Avg: 7.8 h, 95p: 16.4 h) - With an average waiting time of nearly 8 hours, there's room for improvement. Implementing a more efficient liability assessment process could decrease waiting times by at least 20%.

Implementing these changes could significantly improve Orion's claims processing efficiency.
