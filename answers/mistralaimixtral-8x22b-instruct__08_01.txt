### Analysis of the Petri Net

Let's analyze the given Petri net to determine if transition **T5** can fire before transition **T3** in any reachable marking.

#### Initial Marking:
- p0: 1 token
- All other places: 0 tokens

#### Transitions:
1. **T1**: p0 → p1 + p2 (parallel split)
   - Enabled if p0 has at least 1 token.
   - Fires by consuming 1 token from p0 and producing 1 token in p1 and 1 token in p2.

2. **T2**: p1 → p3
   - Enabled if p1 has at least 1 token.
   - Fires by consuming 1 token from p1 and producing 1 token in p3.

3. **T3**: p2 → p4
   - Enabled if p2 has at least 1 token.
   - Fires by consuming 1 token from p2 and producing 1 token in p4.

4. **T4**: p3 + p4 → p5 (synchronizing join)
   - Enabled if both p3 and p4 have at least 1 token.
   - Fires by consuming 1 token from p3 and 1 token from p4, and producing 1 token in p5.

5. **T5**: p3 –|p4 → p6 (inhibitor arc from p4)
   - Enabled if p3 has at least 1 token **and** p4 has 0 tokens.
   - Fires by consuming 1 token from p3 and producing 1 token in p6.

#### Question: Can T5 fire before T3?

To answer this, we need to see if there is a sequence where T5 fires before T3.

#### Possible Firing Sequence:
1. **T1 fires**:
   - Consumes 1 token from p0, produces 1 token in p1 and 1 token in p2.
   - Marking: p1:1, p2:1, p0:0.

2. **T2 fires**:
   - Consumes 1 token from p1, produces 1 token in p3.
   - Marking: p3:1, p2:1, p1:0, p0:0.

3. **T5 fires**:
   - Enabled because p3 has 1 token and p4 has 0 tokens.
   - Consumes 1 token from p3, produces 1 token in p6.
   - Marking: p6:1, p2:1, p3:0, p1:0, p0:0.

At this point, T3 has not yet fired, and T5 has already fired.

#### Justification:
- After T1 and T2, p3 has 1 token and p4 has 0 tokens, so T5 is enabled and can fire.
- T3 is enabled at this point (p2 has 1 token), but it has not yet fired.
- Thus, T5 fires before T3 in this sequence.

#### Conclusion:
**Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.** One such sequence is:
1. T1
2. T2
3. T5

This sequence leads to a marking where T5 has fired before T3.
