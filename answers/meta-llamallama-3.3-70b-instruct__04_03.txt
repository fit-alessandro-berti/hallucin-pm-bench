No

Justification: 
- Rule 1 is not satisfied because `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) do not occur in the required order; RA occurs after `Notify_Authorities` (NA), which is incorrect.
- Rule 2 is not directly violated since `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA, but this is irrelevant due to the violation of Rule 1.
- Rule 3 is violated because `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) is complete.
- Rule 4 is technically satisfied in the order but is built upon the violation of previous rules, making the overall trace non-compliant. 

Therefore, the given execution trace does not respect the official recall-handling ruleset R.
