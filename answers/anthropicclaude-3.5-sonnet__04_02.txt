Let me analyze each rule:

R1. **Compliant**
Total >â‚¬10k, Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval properly sequenced.

R2. **Violated**
Expedited=true but Ship_Goods occurred >2 days after last approval (March 5th vs March 4th).

R3. **Violated**
Pay_Invoice (March 6th) occurred before Receive_Goods (March 7th).

R4. **Not Applicable**
Hazardous=false, so Safety_Inspection not required.

R5. **Compliant**
Change_Request occurred after approvals, and new Manager_Approval was obtained before further processing.

R6. **Compliant**
Case terminated with Archive_Record as required.

Result: **NON-COMPLIANT**
(Due to violations of R2 and R3)
