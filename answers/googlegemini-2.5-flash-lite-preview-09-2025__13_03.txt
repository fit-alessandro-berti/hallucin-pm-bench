**2️⃣ Explanation of Potential Misestimation**

An analyst viewing only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of "Manual Fraud Check" because the data provided represents only a small, unsorted sample of the full month's events.

This excerpt contains three distinct fraud-related activities: "Automatic Fraud Check" (1 occurrence), "Manual Fraud Check" (1 occurrence), and "Fraud Check (Automatic)" (1 occurrence). If the analyst assumes this snippet is representative, they might conclude manual checks are rare, occurring at the same rate as automatic checks. However, the full log could contain hundreds more traces where manual review follows a different path, or where "Manual Fraud Check" is the dominant activity following initial application creation. This limited view does not provide the necessary frequency distribution across the entire dataset.
