No
The fact is inaccurate because for case C003, Validate_Payment occurs at line 6 (2025-02-01T10:43:00Z) before Receive_Order at line 7 (2025-02-01T10:45:00Z), directly violating "follows", and case C005 has Validate_Payment at line 11 without any Receive_Order event whatsoever, making it impossible for the sequence to hold.
