1. **No**

2. **Justification:**  
The fact is inaccurate because there are multiple cases in the event log where other activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":
* **In Case C002:** The activity `Pack_Items` occurs at 09:50:00, which is strictly between `Receive_Order` (09:30:00) and `Validate_Payment` (10:05:00).
* **In Case C004:** The activity `Check_Fraud` occurs at 10:07:00, which is strictly between `Receive_Order` (10:05:00) and `Validate_Payment` (10:20:00). 

While the sequence holds true for cases C001 and C003, the word "always" makes the statement false based on the presence of intervening activities in C002 and C004.
