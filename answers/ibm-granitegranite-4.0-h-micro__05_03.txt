Add a timer event on the sequence flow from "Verify Identity" to "Create Account" with a duration of 48 hours, and insert an escalation event immediately after "Verify Identity" with a condition to trigger if the timer expires, ensuring the SLA deadline is enforced without adding any new activities; `<bpmn:timerEventDefinition id="Timer_CreateAccount" duration="P48H"/>` and `<bpmn:escalationEventDefinition id="Escalate_CreateAccount" />`.
