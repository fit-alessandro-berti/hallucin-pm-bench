No. In case **C003**, **Validate_Payment** occurs at **line 6** and **Receive_Order** at **line 7**, so validation happens *before* receiving the order, not after; in case **C005**, **Validate_Payment** at **line 11** is followed by **Cancel_Order** at **line 12** with no **Receive_Order** present at all. Therefore, the claim that **Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order** is not true for this log fragment.
