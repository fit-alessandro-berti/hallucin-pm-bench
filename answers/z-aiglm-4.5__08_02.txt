**Question 1.** Yes.

**Question 2.** Yes, T5 can fire before T3. T5 requires tokens in P2 and P5. If T3 fires first, it consumes the token in P2, permanently disabling T5. However, a token can be placed in P5 via the sequence T1 → T2 → T7 → T4. This path produces a token in P5 while preserving the token in P2. The resulting marking is {P2, P5}, where both T3 and T5 are enabled. Since any enabled transition can fire, T5 can be chosen. A minimal sequence demonstrating this is [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5].
