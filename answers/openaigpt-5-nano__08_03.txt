Yes. There is a reachable marking where T5 fires before T3. The shortest such firing sequence has 4 transitions.

One example: T1 -> T4 -> T2b -> T5

Reason (brief):
- Start: p0=1
- After T1: pa=1, pb=1
- After T4: pe=1, pb=0 (pa remains 1)
- After T2b: pd=1, pa=0 (pb=0, pe=1)
- T5 is now enabled (pd=1 and pe=1) and fires, giving pf=1
- T3 never fired in this sequence, so T5 fires before T3

Marking progression (concise):
- M0: p0=1
- M1 (T1): pa=1, pb=1
- M2 (T4): pa=1, pb=0, pe=1
- M3 (T2b): pa=0, pb=0, pd=1, pe=1
- M4 (T5): pf=1 (pd=0, pe=0)

Thus T5 can fire before T3; the minimal such sequence is of length 4 (examples: T1, T4, T2b, T5 or T1, T2b, T4, T5).
