**Answer 1:** Yes, T5 can fire before T3.  

**Answer 2 (minimal sequence):**  
`T1, T2, T7, T4, T5`  

*Explanation:*  
T1 splits the initial token into P1 and P2, leaving a token in P2.  
T2 consumes P1 → produces a token in P3.  
T7 consumes that P3 → produces a token in P4.  
T4 consumes P4 → produces a token in P5.  
Now P2 and P5 are simultaneously marked, so T5 can fire, yielding P6.  
No T3 has fired yet, satisfying the requirement.  (120 words)
