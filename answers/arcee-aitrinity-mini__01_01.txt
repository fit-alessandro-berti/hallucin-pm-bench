### Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Process
Based on the defined process, the following are the explicit decision points where a choice must be made:
1. **During Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: The triage agent decides whether to approve or reject the passenger's claim based on the FlightManifest and WeatherReport.
2. **During Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: The finance controller decides to sign off on the claim using the EligibilityChecklist.
3. **At the High-value branch decision point**: The process evaluates the refund amount (as part of Process_Refund_Payment initiation). If the amount exceeds €1,000, a decision is made to proceed to Senior_Auditor_Review; otherwise, the claim moves directly to Process_Refund_Payment. This branch decision is not an explicit activity but is required by the process flow and the condition stated in Constraint 2.

- **RefundRequestForm** (submitted during Customer_Submit_Claim)
