### **Answer**

**No**, it is **not possible** for transition **T5** to fire **before** transition **T3** in any reachable marking of this Petri net.

---

### **Proof of Impossibility**

We analyze the structure and the dependencies in the net to show that **T5 cannot fire before T3**.

#### **1. Initial Marking**
The initial marking is:
- p0 = 1
- All other places (p1–p6) = 0

#### **2. Enabling Conditions**

Let's examine when each transition can be enabled:

- **T1**: Enabled when p0 has at least 1 token.  
  - In the initial marking, **T1 is enabled**.

- **T2**: Enabled when p1 has at least 1 token.  
  - Initially **not enabled** (p1 = 0).

- **T3**: Enabled when p2 has at least 1 token.  
  - Initially **not enabled** (p2 = 0).

- **T4**: Enabled when **both p3 and p4** have at least 1 token.  
  - Initially **not enabled**.

- **T5**: Enabled when:
  - p3 has at least 1 token **AND**
  - p4 has **zero** tokens (because of the inhibitor arc from p4).

  - Initially **not enabled** (p3 = 0).

#### **3. Firing Sequence Analysis**

Let’s consider what must happen **before** T5 can fire:

##### **Step 1: Firing T1**
- T1 consumes 1 token from p0 and produces 1 token in **both p1 and p2**.
- After firing T1, the marking becomes:
  - p0 = 0
  - p1 = 1
  - p2 = 1
  - Others = 0

Now:
- **T2** is enabled (p1 = 1)
- **T3** is enabled (p2 = 1)
- T5 is still **not enabled** (p3 = 0)

##### **Step 2: Can T5 Fire Now?**
- p3 = 0 ⇒ T5 **cannot** fire.

##### **Step 3: What must happen for T5 to become enabled?**

T5 requires:
- p3 ≥ 1
- p4 = 0

So, **p3 must be filled**, and **p4 must remain empty**.

How can p3 get a token?
- Only **T2** produces tokens in p3.
- T2 requires p1 ≥ 1 ⇒ we can fire T2.

Let’s fire **T2**:
- Consumes p1, produces p3.
- Marking becomes:
  - p1 = 0
  - p3 = 1
  - p2 = 1
  - Others = 0

Now:
- T3 is still enabled (p2 = 1)
- T5 is **still not enabled**, because although p3 = 1, **p4 = 0** is required, but **T5 also requires p4 = 0**, which is true, **but** we must also ensure **T5 does not require p4 to be zero *after* some other transition changes it.

Let’s now consider **firing T5** at this point:
- p3 = 1 ✅
- p4 = 0 ✅ (inhibitor arc is satisfied)

So **T5 is now enabled**.

But notice: **T3 has not fired yet**, and **T5 is enabled**.

So far, we have the sequence:  
**T1 → T2 → [T5 enabled]**

Now, can we fire **T5 before T3**?

Let’s try firing **T5** now:

- T5 consumes 1 token from p3, produces 1 token in p6.
- Resulting marking:
  - p3 = 0
  - p6 = 1
  - p2 = 1 (still)
  - p4 = 0

So the sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** is **valid** and **T5 fires before T3**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion: YES, it is possible**

#### **Concrete Firing Sequence proving possibility:**

1. **Initial Marking**: p0 = 1, all others = 0  
2. **Fire T1**:  
   - p0 = 0, p1 = 1, p2 = 1  
3. **Fire T2**:  
   - p1 = 0, p3 = 1, p2 = 1  
4. **Fire T5**:  
   - p3 = 0, p6 = 1, p2 = 1  

In this sequence, **T5 fires after T2 but before T3**.

### 📌 Final Answer:

> **Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire **before** transition **T3**.  
> 
> A valid firing sequence from the initial marking is:  
> **T1 → T2 → T5**  
> 
> After T1 and T2, p3 = 1 and p4 = 0, satisfying the enabling condition for T5 (inhibitor arc from p4 is satisfied because p4 = 0). Therefore, T5 can fire before T3.
