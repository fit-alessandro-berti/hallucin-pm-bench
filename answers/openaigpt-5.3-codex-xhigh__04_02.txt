R1: **Compliant** — PO €12,450 had Manager_Approval before Finance_Approval, satisfying high-value approval sequence.  

R2: **Violated** — Expedited shipment occurred before post-change required Manager_Approval; not within two days after the last required approval.  

R3: **Violated** — Pay_Invoice at 2025-03-06 09:00 occurred before Receive_Goods at 2025-03-07 14:13.  

R4: **Not Applicable** — hazardous=false, so Safety_Inspection control is not triggered.  

R5: **Violated** — Change_Request after approvals was followed by processing steps before new Manager_Approval.  

R6: **Compliant** — Case ends with Archive_Record as final event.  

Overall result: **NON-COMPLIANT**
