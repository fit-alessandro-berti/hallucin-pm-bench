1) The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" appears 1 time in the excerpt.

2) This snippet covers only a few cases and a short time span (entries from 2025-03-01 for CaseIDs 1001â€“1003), so it is not representative of the full month. Activity naming is inconsistent in the data shown ("Automatic Fraud Check" and "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), so occurrences could be recorded under different strings. Cases may have additional events outside the captured timestamps or elsewhere in the month. These sampling and naming limitations can lead an analyst to over- or under-estimate how common manual fraud checks are in the full log.
