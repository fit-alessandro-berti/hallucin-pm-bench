1. **No**

2. Justification:  
- In Case C001, the sequence is: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items. Here, **Validate_Payment** immediately follows **Receive_Order** without any intervening activities, which supports the fact.  
- In Case C002, the sequence is: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment. Here, **Pack_Items** occurs between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, violating the fact.  
- In Case C003, the sequence is: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order. Here, **Validate_Payment** immediately follows **Receive_Order**, which supports the fact.  
- In Case C004, the sequence is: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items. Here, **Check_Fraud** occurs between **Receive_Order** and **Validate_Payment**, violating the fact.

Because there are multiple cases (C002 and C004) where **Validate_Payment** does **not** immediately follow **Receive_Order**, the fact is inaccurate.
