**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Top Performance Gaps & Actions  

Three activities show clear performance deficiencies:  

1. **Request_Documents**: Throughput (190) lags others, with a 150-minute average wait—highest in the process—indicating chronic bottlenecking. High rework (22%) suggests poor initial requests. *Action: Redesign request templates using root-cause analysis of rework cases to reduce follow-ups.*  

2. **Review_Documents**: High processing time (25 min) and variability (stdev=9) correlate with 12.4% SLA breaches—the highest. Rework (5.3%) implies inconsistency. *Action: Standardize review checklists and implement short-interval coaching to reduce variation.*  

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Despite moderate processing time (12 min), the 18-minute wait signals upstream congestion. 3.2% SLA breaches and rework (1.8%) suggest errors propagating. *Action: Rebalance workload from Request_Documents to free capacity and reduce handoff delays.*  

These steps target root causes evident in wait times, rework, and variability. Implement within Q2 with biweekly tracking.
