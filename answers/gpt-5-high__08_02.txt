Q1. Yes.

Q2. Minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Reason: After T1, tokens are in P1 and P2. Advancing only the P1-branch (T2→T7→T4) creates a token in P5 while the token remains in P2. This enables T5 (needs P2 and P5) before any firing of T3. Once T5 fires, it consumes P2, so T3 cannot fire afterward.
