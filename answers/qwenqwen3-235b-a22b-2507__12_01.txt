No, the fact is not accurate.

Justification: In case 1001, "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 2025-03-01 08:30:02, which is *after* "Update_Inventory" at 2025-03-01 08:25:55. This directly contradicts the claim that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory". Additionally, in case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all, further invalidating the claim.
