**No**  
Rule violations:  
*Rule 1:* **Violation** - Regulatory_Affairs_Review occurs after Notify_Authorities. RA review must follow QE review immediately and cannot be after NA.  
*Rule 3:* **Violation** - Notify_Authorities occurs immediately after Quality_Engineer_Review. Must not occur until after both QE and RA are completed.  
*Rule 2:* **Violation** - VP_Safety_Approval follows Regulatory_Affairs_Review instead of being positioned after both QE and RA reviews.  
*Rule 4:* **Not applicable** - though Close_Case follows NA and VP, NA is incorrectly positioned, invalidating compliance for the preceding rules.
