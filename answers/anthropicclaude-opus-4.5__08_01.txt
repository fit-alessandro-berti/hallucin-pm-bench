I need to analyze whether T5 can fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

## Understanding the Net Structure

**Initial marking:** p0=1, all others=0

**T5's firing conditions:**
- Normal arc from p3: needs p3 ≥ 1
- Inhibitor arc from p4: needs p4 = 0

## Tracing Possible Executions

**Step 1:** From initial marking (1,0,0,0,0,0,0), only T1 is enabled.

**After T1:** p0→0, p1→1, p2→1
- Marking: (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)

**Step 2:** Now T2 and T3 are enabled.

**Case A: Fire T2 first**
- After T2: p1→0, p3→1
- Marking: (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)

**Check T5 enablement:** 
- p3 = 1 ✓ (normal arc satisfied)
- p4 = 0 ✓ (inhibitor condition satisfied)

**T5 is enabled!** And T3 has not yet fired.

## Answer: YES

**Concrete firing sequence:** T1 → T2 → T5

| Step | Firing | Marking (p0,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6) |
|------|--------|-------------------------------|
| 0 | — | (1,0,0,0,0,0,0) |
| 1 | T1 | (0,1,1,0,0,0,0) |
| 2 | T2 | (0,0,1,1,0,0,0) |
| 3 | T5 | (0,0,1,0,0,0,1) |

**Justification:** 
- T1 creates tokens in both p1 and p2 (parallel split)
- T2 moves the token from p1 to p3
- At this point, p3=1 and p4=0 (since T3 hasn't fired), so T5's inhibitor condition is satisfied
- T5 fires, consuming the token in p3 and producing in p6
- T3 has never fired (p2 still has its token)

This represents a scenario where one branch completes and takes an "exception path" (T5) before the other parallel branch (T3) executes.
