### **Decision Points in Contoso’s Process**  
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**:  
   - Decision: Whether the claim is eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*.  
2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**:  
   - Decision: Whether to approve the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*.  
3. **High-value threshold check**:  
   - Decision: If the refund amount exceeds **€1 000**, the case proceeds to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (requires *AuditTrail*).
