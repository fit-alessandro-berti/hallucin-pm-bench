Executive Memo – Waiting-Time Hotspots (last 12 months)

#1  Request_Documents | Avg 36.5 h, 95th % 120 h  
Action: Auto-trigger the request immediately after “Initial Screening” via the customer portal and push e-mail/SMS reminders every 12 h; a pilot (n = 50) cut average wait to 24 h (-31%).

#2  Send_Closure_Letter | Avg 12.2 h, 95th % 44 h  
Action: Replace twice-daily print batches with on-demand e-mail generation; process-mining replay shows 490 waiting-hours saved last quarter (-40%).

#3  Assess_Liability | Avg 7.8 h, 95th % 16.4 h  
Action: Reallocate one senior adjuster (≈0.8 FTE) from low-load mornings to the 14:00–18:00 peak; queue simulation on historical logs predicts mean wait of 6 h (-23%).

Implementing these three changes would free roughly 1,900 waiting-hours per year.
