**No**

Trace 2025-05-RX17 is **not compliant** with ruleset R.

**Rule-by-rule analysis:**

1. **VIOLATED** - While both Quality_Engineer_Review and Regulatory_Affairs_Review occur once each, they are NOT in the required order. The trace shows Quality_Engineer_Review occurring before Regulatory_Affairs_Review, but Notify_Authorities occurs between them, breaking the required sequence.

2. **SATISFIED** - Since severity = "High", VP_Safety_Approval is required after both QE and RA. VP_Safety_Approval occurs after both reviews in the trace.

3. **VIOLATED** - Notify_Authorities occurs after Quality_Engineer_Review but BEFORE Regulatory_Affairs_Review is complete. Rule 3 requires NA to occur only after both QE and RA are complete.

4. **SATISFIED** - Close_Case occurs after Notify_Authorities and VP_Safety_Approval, which satisfies this rule.

The trace violates rules 1 and 3, making it non-compliant.
