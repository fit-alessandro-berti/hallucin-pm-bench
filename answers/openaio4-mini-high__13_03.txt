1️⃣ The exact string “Manual Fraud Check” appears **once** in the excerpt.  
2️⃣ With only this small slice of three cases over a short time window, you can’t know whether manual fraud checks are rare or common across all cases and times in March. The sample may omit days, peak‐load periods, or alternative process variants where manual checks are more frequent. In process-mining, partial logs risk sampling bias: without full coverage of cases, activities and their frequency can look misleading compared to the full month’s data.
