Let me analyze this XES event log fragment to answer your questions.

First, I'll organize the events by case and timestamp:

**Case C001:**
- 09:12:00: Receive_Order
- 09:20:05: Check_Stock  
- 10:05:10: Ship_Order

**Case C002:**
- 09:15:10: Receive_Order
- 09:22:55: Check_Stock
- 10:15:20: Arrange_Delivery
- 10:25:40: Ship_Order

**Case C003:**
- 09:21:30: Receive_Order
- 09:25:05: Check_Stock
- 10:20:30: Ship_Order

Now I can answer the questions:

**Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**
3

**Q2: For case "C002", list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred:**
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

**Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order":**
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
