No, the fact is not accurate based on the provided event-log fragment.  

**Justification**:  
1. In **Case 1001**, "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02) occurs *after* "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55), not before.  
2. In **Case 1002**, "Update_Inventory" is never performed, so the claimed sequence cannot apply.  
3. In **Case 1003**, "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund" (10:15:42), contradicting the stated fact.  

The data show no instance where "Authorize_Refund" immediately precedes "Update_Inventory."
