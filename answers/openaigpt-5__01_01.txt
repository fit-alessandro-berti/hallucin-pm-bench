Decision points
- Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility
  - Decision: Does the claim meet eligibility based on the FlightManifest and WeatherReport? Eligible claims proceed to Finance_Controller_PreApprove; otherwise the process cannot continue.
- Finance_Controller_PreApprove
  - Decision: Pre-approve the claim using the EligibilityChecklist? Only pre-approved claims can move forward.
- High-value branch
  - Decision: Is the refund amount greater than â‚¬1 000? If yes, route to Senior_Auditor_Review (must include the AuditTrail). If no, skip that review.
- Payment readiness gate before Process_Refund_Payment
  - Decision: Are all prerequisites satisfied (Finance_Controller_PreApprove complete, Senior_Auditor_Review complete for high-value cases, and a signed BankTransferAuthorization present)? If yes, execute payment; otherwise, hold.
