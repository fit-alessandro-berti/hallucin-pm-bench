Non-compliant

1. **Rule P2P-2025.R1-Approval**: The total amount of the purchase order is €12,300, exceeding the €10,000 threshold. According to the rule, two approvals are required, first by a **Procurement Officer** and then by the **CFO**, before the activity `Issue_PO`. The process respects this rule as both approvals (by the Procurement Officer and the CFO) occurred before `Issue_PO` at events 2 and 3.
2. **Rule P2P-2025.R1-Exp expedite**: The **Expedite_Flag** activity was triggered at event 4. This makes **Quality_Check** optional but requires that **Risk_Assessment** occur before the first occurrence of **Ship_Goods**. The **Risk_Assessment** activity occurred at event 9, which is before **Ship_Goods** at event 8. This rule is therefore respected.
3. **Rule P2P-2025.R1-Three_way_match**: The **Three_way_match** activity occurred at event 10. According to the rule, this activity must be completed within two activities after **Goods_Received** (event 6). The distance between **Goods_Received** and **Three_way_match** is 4 activities, which violates the rule. Therefore, this rule is not respected.
4. **Rule P2P-2025.R1-Role_Transition**: The rule states that no activity executed by the **Intern** role may directly follow an activity executed by the **CFO**. At event 7, the **Intern** executed the **Move_to_Quality** activity directly after the **CFO** executed the **Approve_PO_CFO** activity at event 3. This violation of the role transition rule makes the process non-compliant.**Justification summary**: The violations are rule P2P-2025.R1-Three_way_match (distance violation) and rule P2P-2025.R1-Role_Transition (role transition violation).
