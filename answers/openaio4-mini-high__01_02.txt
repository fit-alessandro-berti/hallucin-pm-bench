Decision Points  
1. Underwriter Alignment Gate  
   • Compare Senior Underwriter A’s score vs. Shadow Underwriter B’s score  
   • If difference ≤ 2 → proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)  
   • If difference > 2 → escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for tie-break, then proceed to NFC  

2. Amount Threshold Decision  
   • If requested amount < €15 000 → system auto-approves  
   • If requested amount ≥ €15 000 → route to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)  

3. Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)  
   • Board votes to approve or reject
