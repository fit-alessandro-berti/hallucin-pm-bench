**No**, the fact is not accurate.

Justification:
While examining case-by-case sequences:

- C001: "Receive_Order" → "Validate_Payment" (immediate)
- C002: "Receive_Order" → "Pack_Items" → "Validate_Payment" (not immediate)
- C003: "Receive_Order" → "Validate_Payment" (immediate)
- C004: "Receive_Order" → "Check_Fraud" → "Validate_Payment" (not immediate)

In cases C002 and C004, there are activities that occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":
- In C002, "Pack_Items" occurs between them
- In C004, "Check_Fraud" occurs between them

Therefore, the statement that "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order" is false, as this pattern only holds true for cases C001 and C003, but not for C002 and C004.
