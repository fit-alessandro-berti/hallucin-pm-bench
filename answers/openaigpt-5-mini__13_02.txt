1. Manual_Fraud_Check occurs 1 time.

2.
a) Share of all events: 1/48 = 2.08%  
b) Share of unique cases: 1/12 = 8.33%

3. Because Manual_Fraud_Check appears only once in this 48-event, 12-case excerpt (case C05), any performance measure or predictive model trained on this slice would be based on a single observation. That makes estimates unreliable: it can act as an outlier, inflate variance, cause overfitting, and produce misleading branching probabilities or resource-impact conclusions when generalized.
