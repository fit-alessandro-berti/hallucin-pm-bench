**Answer 1.** Yes.

**Answer 2 (bonus).** **T1, T2, T7, T4, T5**.

**Explanation:**
Firing T1 produces tokens in P1 and P2. To enable T5 (requiring P2 and P5), we must obtain P5 without consuming P2 via T3. This is achieved by firing T2 (P1→P3) and T7 (P3→P4) to generate P4. Firing T4 then produces P5. In the marking {P2, P5}, T5 is enabled and fires before T3 can occur.
