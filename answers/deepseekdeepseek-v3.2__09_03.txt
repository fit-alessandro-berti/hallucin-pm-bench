1. **Average cycle time (in hours) of activity “Approve Invoice”**: Cannot be computed.  
2. **Standard deviation and 95% confidence interval**: Cannot be computed.  

**Reason**:  
The event log (Artefact A) contains no actual data rows—all timestamps and case details are redacted. To compute the cycle time (duration) of the “Approve Invoice” activity, the specific `start_time` and `complete_time` values for each instance of that activity are required. Since these values are absent, no calculations can be performed. Artefact B provides only an average time *between* activities (from “Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice”), which is a separate metric and does not give the internal duration of the “Approve Invoice” activity itself.
