Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Key Activity Underperformance  

The three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Request_Documents**  
   - Issues: Very low throughput (190 vs. ~270 upstream) and the highest wait time (150 min). Extremely high rework (22%) drives extra cycles and a relatively high SLA breach rate (5.5%). This is the primary flow bottleneck.  
   - Action: Standardize and pre-define document requirements per claim type and enhance customer guidance (templates/portal checklists) to cut rework and queue time.

2. **Review_Documents**  
   - Issues: Long processing time (25 min, highest in process) with high variability (stdev 9) and elevated SLA breaches (12.4%), plus notable rework (5.3%). Suggests inconsistent review quality and case complexity handling.  
   - Action: Introduce review checklists and decision aids; segment complex vs. simple cases with routing of complex cases to specialists to reduce variability and SLA breaches.

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - Issues: Elevated wait time (18 min vs. 2–6 min for most others) and moderate SLA breach rate (3.2%), indicating a capacity or prioritization constraint early in the process.  
   - Action: Rebalance workload and adjust staffing/scheduling at this step based on arrival patterns to reduce queueing.
