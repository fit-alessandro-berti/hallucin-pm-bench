1. **No**

2. Justification:
   - **Case C002**: The activity sequence is `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`. Here, `Validate_Payment` does **not** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` (it is preceded by `Pack_Items`).
   - **Case C004**: The activity sequence is `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment`. Here, `Validate_Payment` does **not** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` (it is preceded by `Check_Fraud`).

Only **Case C001** and **Case C003** follow the pattern where `Validate_Payment` occurs immediately after `Receive_Order`. Since the FACT claims this is **always** true, it is incorrect.
