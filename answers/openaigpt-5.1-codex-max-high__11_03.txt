Subject: Bottlenecks vs. SLA – Priority Fixes

Three activities are significantly breaching SLAs while incurring the highest waiting times, driving end-to-end delays. Legal Approval averages 900s against a 600s SLA, exceeding by 300s with the highest waiting time at 600s. Risk Review averages 600s versus a 300s SLA, exceeding by 300s and incurring 480s waiting. Credit Assessment averages 300s against a 240s SLA, exceeding by 60s with 200s waiting. These steps combine material SLA overruns with substantial queueing, indicating constrained capacity and elongated handoffs.

Recommendations:
- Legal Approval: Rebalance workload or add approval capacity to cut the 600s waiting time and recover the 300s SLA overrun.
- Risk Review: Introduce parallel review slots or triage to reduce the 480s waiting time that drives the 300s SLA gap.
- Credit Assessment: Streamline intake and allocate more assessors to compress the 200s waiting time and close the 60s SLA gap.
