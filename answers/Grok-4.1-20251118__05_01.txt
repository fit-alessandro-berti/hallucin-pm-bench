Add a **timer intermediate catching event** (e.g., id="Timer_48h") attached to the boundary of **Task_Check** (or the entire completeness-check + request-docs loop) with a **timeDuration of PT48H** that starts when the claim is submitted.

If the timer fires before the process reaches **Task_Triage**, connect it directly to **Task_Assign** (bypassing normal triage) and set a flag for auto-escalation.

This ensures every claim automatically proceeds to adjuster assignment (and thus passes Triage) within 48 hours without adding new tasks, using only an interrupting boundary timer event and a new sequence flow.
