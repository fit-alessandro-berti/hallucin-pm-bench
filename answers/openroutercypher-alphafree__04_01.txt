**Compliant**

**Justification:**

1. **(Rule 1)** *Approvals for high-value PO*:
    - PO amount (€12 300) surpasses €10 000 threshold.
    - Correct sequence of approvals: first `Approve_PO` (Procurement Officer), then `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO) before `Issue_PO`.

2. **(Rule 2)** *Expedite scenarios*:
    - `Expedite_Flag` present in trace (event #4 before `Issue_PO`).
    - `Risk_Assessment` (event #9) occurs **before** `Ship_Goods` (event #8).
    - `Quality_Check` omitted (optional here), compliant with expedite-flag conditions.

3. **(Rule 3)** *Three-way match proximity*:
    - `Three_way_match` (event #10) occurs within two slots after `Goods_Received` (event #6) → correct sequence (6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 complies).

4. **(Rule 4)** *CFO-Intern sequencing*:
    - Immediate check shows no direct following after CFO's activity (event #3 → by System). `Move_to_Quality` by Intern (event #7) is well after CFO's approval.

5. **(Rule 5)** *Final activity*:
    - Trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event #11), no subsequent activities.

Trace ID 24-EXP aligns with P2P-2025.R1 process regulations.
