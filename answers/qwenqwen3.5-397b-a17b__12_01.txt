No, the fact is **inaccurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

*   In **Case 1001**, "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02).
*   In **Case 1003**, "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18).
*   In **Case 1002**, the activity "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all.

The data shows the reverse order where both activities exist, contradicting the claim.
