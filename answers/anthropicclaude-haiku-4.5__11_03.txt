**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** [Current Date]
**RE:** Critical Performance Gaps in Application Processing Pipeline

Three activities require immediate intervention:

**Legal Approval** represents our most severe bottleneck. With an average throughput time of 900 seconds against a 600-second SLA, it exceeds target by 300 seconds (50%). Waiting time of 600 seconds compounds this delay.
- Action: Implement parallel legal review workflows to reduce sequential processing and allocate dedicated approval capacity during peak intake periods.

**Risk Review** breaches its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds (100%), with 480 seconds waiting time across 480 cases. This represents a critical escalation point.
- Action: Deploy risk assessment automation for standard cases to reduce manual review time and eliminate non-value-added waiting.

**Verify Identity** exceeds its 90-second SLA by 30 seconds (33%), with 80 seconds of waiting time affecting 1,180 casesâ€”our highest volume activity.
- Action: Establish dedicated identity verification lanes with pre-positioned resources to compress waiting time from 80 to 20 seconds.

These three activities collectively impact decision velocity significantly and warrant immediate resource reallocation.
