To answer the questions, let's analyze the provided event log fragment.

Q1. **Distinct Case IDs:**
   - From the events, the distinct case IDs are: `A-9321`, `B-1045`, and `C-77`.
   - Therefore, there are 3 distinct case IDs.

Q2. **Activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" in case A-9321:**
   - For case `A-9321`, the relevant sequence is:
     - "Receive_Order" at `2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00`
     - "Validate_Order" at `2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00`
     - "Pack_Items" at `2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00`
     - "Ship_Order" at `2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00`
   - The activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items".

Q3. **Earliest timestamp:**
   - The timestamps provided are:
     - `2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T08:16:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T08:17:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T09:01:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T09:10:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T09:20:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T09:25:00.000+00:00`
     - `2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00`
   - The earliest timestamp is `2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00`.

Q4. **Occurrences of "Quality_Check":**
   - The activity "Quality_Check" occurs in:
     - Case `B-1045` at `2025-04-14T08:45:00.000+00:00`
     - Case `C-77` at `2025-04-14T10:00:00.000+00:00`
   - Therefore, "Quality_Check" occurs 2 times.

Q5. **Activities never appearing as the first event of any case:**
   - First events for each case:
     - Case `A-9321`: "Receive_Order"
     - Case `B-1045`: "Receive_Order"
     - Case `C-77`: "Quality_Check"
   - Activities not appearing as the first event are: "Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order".

Now, let's format the answers according to the specified JSON schema:

```json
{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Pack_Items",
  "Q3": "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00",
  "Q4": 2,
  "Q5": ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]
}
```
