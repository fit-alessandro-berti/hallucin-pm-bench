**TO:** Chief Operating Officer
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**SUBJECT:** Analysis of Process Bottlenecks and Recommended Actions

This memo identifies the three most critical bottlenecks in our credit application process based on current performance data.

The Legal Approval and Risk Review activities are the worst-performing, each breaching its target SLA by 300 seconds. Legal Approval's 900-second throughput time includes a 600-second average wait. Similarly, Risk Review's 600-second throughput time is driven by a 480-second wait. The Credit Assessment activity also requires action, exceeding its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds. This results from a 200-second average waiting time, which constitutes two-thirds of its total 300-second throughput time. For all three activities, excessive waiting time is the primary cause of SLA failure.

To improve performance, I recommend the following:

*   For Legal Approval, prioritize reducing the 600-second average waiting time, which accounts for 67% of its total throughput.
*   For Risk Review, focus on decreasing the 480-second average waiting time, which represents 80% of its total throughput.
*   For Credit Assessment, target the 200-second average waiting time, which constitutes 67% of its total throughput.
