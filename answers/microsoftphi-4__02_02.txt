To answer the questions based on the provided XES event log fragment:

### Q1: How many **distinct cases** are present in this fragment?

The cases present in the log are:
- C001
- C002
- C003

Thus, there are **3 distinct cases**.

### Q2: For case **“C002”**, list the **sequence of activities** in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).

For case "C002", the events are:
1. Receive_Order at "2025-03-01T09:15:10"
2. Check_Stock at "2025-03-01T09:22:55"
3. Arrange_Delivery at "2025-03-01T10:15:20"
4. Ship_Order at "2025-03-01T10:25:40"

The sequence of activities for case "C002" is:
```
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
```

### Q3: Across all cases, list every **distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”** (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

To determine which activities precede "Ship_Order", we look at the events immediately before "Ship_Order" for each case:

- For case "C001", "Check_Stock" precedes "Ship_Order".
- For case "C003", "Check_Stock" precedes "Ship_Order".
- For case "C002", "Arrange_Delivery" precedes "Ship_Order".

The distinct activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" are:
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
