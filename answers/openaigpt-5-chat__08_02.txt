**Answer 1:** **No**  

**Answer 2:**  
T5 requires tokens in **P2** and **P5** simultaneously.  
- **P5** is produced only by T4.  
- T4 requires a token in **P4**.  
- P4 can be produced either by **T7** (after T2) or by **T3**.  
- Importantly, firing **T3** consumes the only token in **P2** given by concurrent branch of T1.  

Therefore, without firing **T3**, P5 can never be produced; but if T3 fires, the P2 token is gone and T5 cannot be enabled.  
Thus, there is no reachable marking where T5 fires before T3.
