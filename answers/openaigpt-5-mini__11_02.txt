Subject: Q1‑2025 Claims Handling — top performance issues and recommended fixes

1) Review_Documents — Worst: highest SLA breach (12.4%) and longest avg_processing_time (25 min) with high variability (stdev 9) and nontrivial wait (30 min).  
Action: Pilot a standardized review checklist and triage for 30 days; measure reduction in avg_processing_time and stdev. Target: halve sla_breach_pct (12.4% → ≤6%).

2) Request_Documents — Worst: extreme avg_wait_time (150 min) and very high rework_rate (22%), causing throughput drag and repeat work (sla_breach 5.5%).  
Action: Implement mandatory completeness checks in the document request flow (digital form/validation) and automated reminders; run a 3‑month A/B test. Target: cut rework_rate_pct from 22% → ≤10% and reduce avg_wait_time substantially.

3) Initial_Assessment — Third concern: second‑highest sla_breach (3.2%) and elevated avg_wait_time (18 min) with moderate processing (12 min).  
Action: Introduce queue‑threshold alerts and short triage rules to reduce waiting; pilot and aim to lower avg_wait_time <10 min and sla_breach_pct <1%.

I will provide a 90‑day KPI dashboard template to track these pilots if you approve.
