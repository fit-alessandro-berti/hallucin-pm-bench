Add a timer boundary event to Task_Receive (id="Task_Receive") with a 48-hour timeDuration. Connect its sequence flow to a new escalation event (e.g., id="EscalateTimer") that converges back to Task_Triage via a new flow (e.g., id="f10"). This ensures any claim delayed beyond 48 hours from Start_Claim auto-escalates directly to Triage, bypassing further checks, without new tasks. Update GW_Docs flow f5 to remain for on-time complete cases. (62 words)
