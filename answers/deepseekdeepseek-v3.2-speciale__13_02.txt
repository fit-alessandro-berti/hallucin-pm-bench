3. **Explanation (≤100 words):**  
   A low-support activity like this (only one occurrence) can mislead performance analyses because metrics such as average duration or frequency become heavily skewed by a single outlier. In predictive modeling, rare events may cause overfitting or generate unrealistic predictions. Generalizing from such a small slice can incorrectly imply that the activity is a typical part of the process, leading to flawed redesign decisions.
