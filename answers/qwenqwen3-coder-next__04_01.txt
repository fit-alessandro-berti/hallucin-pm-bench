**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1 violation**: PO amount is €12,300 (> €10,000), so two approvals — *first by Procurement Officer, then by CFO* — must occur **before** `Issue_PO`. While the trace shows `Approve_PO` (by Procurement_Officer) at step 2 and `Approve_PO_CFO` (by CFO) at step 3, both precede `Issue_PO` (step 5), satisfying the *ordering* requirement. However, **Rule 1 explicitly requires two *distinct* approvals before `Issue_PO`**, and the trace shows two separate approval activities. So this part is *actually compliant* — but note: the activity names suggest proper sequencing. So no violation here.

2. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (step 4), making `Quality_Check` optional (which is fine — `Quality_Check` is absent, and that’s allowed). However, Rule 2 mandates that **`Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`**. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at step 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs at step 9 — *after* `Ship_Goods`. This violates Rule 2.

3. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (step 6), `Three_way_match` must occur within the next two activities (i.e., by steps 7 or 8 max). `Three_way_match` occurs at step 10 — **four activities after** `Goods_Received` (steps 7: Move_to_Quality, 8: Ship_Goods, 9: Risk_Assessment, 10: Three_way_match). Distance = 10 − 6 = 4 > 2 → violates Rule 3.

4. **Rule 4 violation**: Rule 4 states: *No activity executed by Intern may directly follow an activity executed by CFO*. In the trace, step 3 (`Approve_PO_CFO`) is by CFO, and step 4 (`Expedite_Flag`) is by System — not Intern, so fine. Step 2 (`Approve_PO`) is by Procurement_Officer, step 3 by CFO — next activity (step 4) is by System — okay. Step 7 (`Move_to_Quality`) is by Intern, and the preceding activity (step 6, `Goods_Received`) is by Warehouse_Clerk — okay. No direct CFO → Intern succession occurs, so **Rule 4 is satisfied**.

5. **Rule 5**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (step 11), and nothing follows — compliant.

**However**, the two clear violations are:

- **Rule 2**: `Risk_Assessment` (step 9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` (step 8), but must occur **before** it due to `Expedite_Flag`.
- **Rule 3**: `Three_way_match` (step 10) is too far from `Goods_Received` (step 6); distance = 4 > 2.

Thus, the trace is **Non-compliant**.
