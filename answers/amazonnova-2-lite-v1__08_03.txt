### **Answer**

**Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3** in a reachable marking. Below is the **shortest firing sequence** achieving this order.

### 🔧 **Shortest Firing Sequence for T5 before T3**

Here is the minimal sequence of transitions that leads to **T5 firing before T3**:

```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```

### 📌 **Step-by-Step Marking Evolution**

We'll now show the marking after each transition in the sequence.

#### **Initial Marking**
```
p0 = 1
pa = 0
pb = 0
pc = 0
pd = 0
pe = 0
pf = 0
```

---

#### **Fire T1**

- **Input:** p0 (has 1 token)
- **Output:** pa, pb (each get 1 token)

```
p0 = 0
pa = 1
pb = 1
pc = 0
pd = 0
pe = 0
pf = 0
```

---

#### **Fire T2b**

- **Input:** pa (has 1 token)
- **Output:** pd (gets 1 token)

```
p0 = 0
pa = 0
pb = 1
pc = 0
pd = 1
pe = 0
pf = 0
```

> Note: T2 could have fired instead, but we choose T2b to skip T3 — this is the key to enabling T5 before T3.

---

#### **Fire T4**

- **Input:** pb (has 1 token)
- **Output:** pe (gets 1 token)

```
p0 = 0
pa = 0
pb = 0
pc = 0
pd = 1
pe = 1
pf = 0
```

---

#### **Fire T5**

- **Input:** pd (1 token), pe (1 token)
- **Output:** pf (gets 1 token)

```
p0 = 0
pa = 0
pb = 0
pc = 0
pd = 0
pe = 0
pf = 1
```

✅ **T5 has fired**, and **T3 has not yet fired** (its input place `pc` is still empty).

---

### 🚫 Why is this ordering **possible**?

- **T3** requires a token in **pc**.
- In this sequence, we **never fired T2** (which would put a token in pc), and instead took the shortcut **T2b**, which puts a token in **pd** directly.
- This allows **T4** to fire (from pb), and then **T5** can synchronize pd and pe — **without ever involving pc or T3**.

Thus, **T5 can indeed fire before T3**, and the sequence `T1 → T2b → T4 → T5` is the shortest such sequence.

### ✅ Final Answer

> **Yes**, transition **T5** can fire before **T3**.  
> **One shortest firing sequence:** `T1 → T2b → T4 → T5`
