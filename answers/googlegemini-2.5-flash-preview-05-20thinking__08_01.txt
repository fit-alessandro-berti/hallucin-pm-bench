Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire *before* transition T3.

**Concrete Firing Sequence and Justification:**

1.  **Initial Marking (M0):** (p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0)
    *   Only T1 is enabled.

2.  **Fire T1:** (p0 → p1 + p2)
    *   **M1:** (p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0)
    *   At M1, both T2 (requires p1) and T3 (requires p2) are enabled.

3.  **Fire T2:** (p1 → p3)
    *   **M2:** (p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0)
    *   At M2:
        *   **T5 is enabled** because p3 has a token (p3=1) AND p4 has no tokens (p4=0), satisfying the inhibitor arc condition.
        *   **T3 is also enabled** because p2 has a token (p2=1).

4.  **Fire T5:** (p3 –|p4 → p6)
    *   **M3:** (p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=1)
    *   At this point, T5 has fired. T3 has not yet fired (p2 still has a token, and p4 is still empty).

**Justification:**
The firing sequence M0 → T1 → M1 → T2 → M2 → T5 demonstrates that T5 can fire before T3. After T1 fires, tokens are placed in p1 and p2. T2 can fire independently of T3 (or vice-versa). By allowing T2 to fire first, p3 receives a token while p4 remains empty (since T3, which produces p4, has not yet fired). This exact state (p3=1, p4=0) enables T5. Since T3 was enabled but we chose to fire T5, T5 fires before T3.
