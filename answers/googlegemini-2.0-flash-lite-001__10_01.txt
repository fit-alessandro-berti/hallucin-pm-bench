Here is the RACI matrix for FinCoâ€™s order-to-cash workflow, using the correct terminology:

| Activity           | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Receive Application | R                    |                             |                    |                 |
| KYC Review         |                      | C                           |                    |                 |
| Order Vetting      | R                    |                             |                    |                 |
| Payment Clearance  |                      |                             | R                  |                 |
| Record Update      |                      |                             |                    | R               |
| Notify Customer    | R                    |                             |                    |                 |

**Legend:**

*   **R** = Responsible (Does the work)
*   **C** = Consulted (Provides input)
*   **A** = Accountable (Ultimately owns the work)
*   **I** = Informed (Kept up-to-date)
