Okay, so I need to check if the claim that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" in the same case is accurate based on the given event-log fragment. Let me start by looking at the log data provided.

First, let me list out the activities for each case:

For Case 1001:
- Receive_Return
- Inspect_Item
- Update_Inventory
- Authorize_Refund
- Refund_Issued

For Case 1002:
- Receive_Return
- Inspect_Item
- Authorize_Refund
- Refund_Issued

For Case 1003:
- Receive_Return
- Inspect_Item
- Update_Inventory
- Quality_Check
- Authorize_Refund

The claim states that "Authorize_Refund" must come immediately before "Update_Inventory". Let me check each case to see if this holds true.

Case 1001: Looking at the sequence, "Update_Inventory" happens at line 3, and "Authorize_Refund" is at line 4. So here, "Update_Inventory" comes before "Authorize_Refund", which is the opposite of what the claim says. 

Case 1002: This case doesn't have an "Update_Inventory" activity at all. It goes from "Inspect_Item" to "Authorize_Refund". So there's no instance of "Update_Inventory" here to compare with "Authorize_Refund".

Case 1003: "Update_Inventory" is at line 3, and "Authorize_Refund" is at line 5. There's a "Quality_Check" in between them. So again, "Update_Inventory" comes before "Authorize_Refund", not the other way around as the claim suggests. Plus, there's another activity in between, so it's not immediately before.

So based on the provided data, in Case 1001 and 1003, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund", not the other way around. In Case 1002, there's no "Update_Inventory" at all. Therefore, the statement that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case is not accurate according to this log fragment.
The stated fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification**:
- **Case 1001**: The sequence shows `Update_Inventory` occurs at line 3, followed by `Authorize_Refund` at line 4. Thus, `Update_Inventory` comes before `Authorize_Refund`, contradicting the claim.
- **Case 1002**: This case has no `Update_Inventory` activity, making it impossible for `Authorize_Refund` to follow it.
- **Case 1003**: Here, `Update_Inventory` appears at line 3, with `Authorize_Refund` at line 5, making it non-immediate due to the `Quality_Check` activity in between.

The log data shows that `Update_Inventory` actually precedes `Authorize_Refund` in Cases 1001 and 1003, and is absent in Case 1002, making the claim false according to the provided fragment.
