**Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

### Concrete Firing Sequence
**σ = ⟨ T1, T2, T5 ⟩**

### Justification
1.  **Initial Marking:** $M_0 = \{p0:1\}$. Only **T1** is enabled.
2.  **Fire T1:** Consumes token from $p0$, produces tokens to $p1$ and $p2$.
    *   Marking: $\{p1:1, p2:1\}$.
    *   Enabled: **T2** (needs $p1$), **T3** (needs $p2$). **T5** is *not* enabled (needs $p3$).
3.  **Fire T2:** Consumes token from $p1$, produces token to $p3$.
    *   Marking: $\{p2:1, p3:1\}$. Note that $p4$ is still **0**.
    *   Enabled: **T3** (needs $p2$), **T5** (needs $p3=1$ AND inhibitor $p4=0$).
4.  **Fire T5:** Since $p3$ contains a token and $p4$ is empty (T3 has not fired yet), the inhibitor condition is satisfied. **T5** fires.
    *   **T3** has not fired in this sequence.

Thus, **T5** fires strictly before **T3**.
