1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears **1** time in the fragment.

2. Total events logged = 18  
   Percentage = (1 / 18) x 100 = 5.56%

3. Case identifier: **A1002**

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the monthly estimate is unreliable:  
   • **Very small sample size** - only 18 orders are logged, so the observed frequency (1/18) is highly sensitive to random variation and unlikely to reflect the true monthly rate.  
   • **Potential selection bias** - if these 18 cases are not a random, representative subset of all orders (e.g., they might be from a single day or a special promotion), the proportion of manual fraud checks could be skewed compared to a full month's data.
