**No**

The stated fact is inaccurate. While Validate_Payment does follow Receive_Order in cases C001 (lines 1-2) and C002 (lines 3-5), there are clear counterexamples. In case C003, Validate_Payment occurs at 10:43 (line 6) while Receive_Order happens at 10:45 (line 7), meaning Validate_Payment actually precedes Receive_Order. Additionally, in case C005, Validate_Payment appears (line 11) but there is no Receive_Order activity at all for this case - only Cancel_Order follows (line 12). These violations demonstrate that Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order in the log fragment.
