Yes. From the given initial marking you can reach a state where \(T_5\) fires without \(T_3\) having fired at all, by taking the “shortcut” \(T2b\) to fill \(p_d\).

One shortest firing sequence is:
```
T1   // p0 → pa,pb
T2b  // pa → pd
T4   // pb → pe
T5   // pd+pe → pf
```
After these firings \(T_5\) has occurred and \(T_3\) has not.
