Yes – T5 can be executed before T3.

One concrete firing sequence starting from the initial marking M0  
   (p0 = 1, all other places = 0) is  

    1.  T1 p0 → p1+p2  
        Marking M1:  p1 = 1, p2 = 1

    2.  T2 p1 → p3  
        Marking M2:  p3 = 1, p2 = 1,  p4 = 0

    3.  T5 p3 –|p4 → p6 (enabled because p3 = 1 and p4 = 0)  
        Marking M3:  p2 = 1, p6 = 1

    4.  T3 p2 → p4 (now, if desired)  
        Marking M4:  p4 = 1, p6 = 1

Explanation

• T5 needs a token in p3 and zero tokens in p4.  
• After steps 1 and 2 those conditions hold, so T5 is enabled even though
  T3 has not fired yet.  
• Therefore T5 can indeed fire before T3.

(Once T3 has fired, p4 contains a token and the inhibitor arc disables T5, so the only possible moment for T5 to fire is precisely before T3.)
