 **Question 1.** Yes.

**Question 2.** T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

T1 produces tokens in P1 and P2. The upper branch T2→T7→T4 generates a token in P5 while preserving the token in P2. This enables T5 to fire using P2 and P5 before T3 can consume P2. T3 and T5 compete for the single P2 token, so any firing of T5 must occur before T3 (or T3 never fires).
