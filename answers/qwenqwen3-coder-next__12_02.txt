No.  
The fact is false because in case C003, *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 6 (10:43:00Z) *before* *Receive_Order* at line 7 (10:45:00Z), violating the required “always follows” sequence. Similarly, in case C005, *Validate_Payment* appears at line 11 before *Receive_Order* does not occur at all, meaning *Validate_Payment* does not follow *Receive_Order* in that case either.
