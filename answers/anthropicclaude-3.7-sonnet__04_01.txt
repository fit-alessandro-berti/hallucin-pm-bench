I need to analyze this purchase-to-pay trace against the P2P-2025.R1 rule set.

Non-compliant, for the following reason:

2. Rule 2 states that if the trace contains activity `Expedite_Flag` (which it does in event #4), then activity `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, in this trace, `Ship_Goods` (event #8) occurs before `Risk_Assessment` (event #9), which violates this requirement.

All other rules appear to be satisfied:
- Rule 1: The PO amount is €12,300 (exceeds €10,000) and both required approvals (Procurement_Officer and CFO) occur before `Issue_PO`.
- Rule 3: After `Goods_Received` (event #6), `Three_way_match` (event #10) occurs within 2 activities after it.
- Rule 4: No activity executed by an Intern directly follows an activity executed by the CFO.
- Rule 5: The trace correctly finishes with `Archive_Record` with nothing following it.
