1. **Eligibility Decision (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility)**
   - **Decision:** Is the claim eligible for a refund based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?

   - **Decision:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1,000**?
   - **Outcome:**
     - If **≤ €1,000**, proceed directly to *Process_Refund_Payment* after pre-approval.
     - If **> €1,000**, escalate to *Senior_Auditor_Review* before payment.

3. **Payment Authorization (Process_Refund_Payment)**
   - **Decision:** Is the *BankTransferAuthorization* signed and available?
