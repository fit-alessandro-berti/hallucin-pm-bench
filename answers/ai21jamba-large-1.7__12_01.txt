No, the above fact is **not accurate**.

- In **Case 1001**, "Authorize_Refund" occurs **after** "Update_Inventory". Specifically:
	- "Update_Inventory" happens at **08:25:55**, followed by "Authorize_Refund" at **08:30:02**.
- In **Case 1002**, "Authorize_Refund" occurs **before** "Update_Inventory", but this activity is **not applicable** as "Update_Inventory" does not appear in this case.
- In **Case 1003**, "Authorize_Refund" occurs **after** "Update_Inventory". Specifically:
	- "Update_Inventory" happens at **10:08:07**, followed by "Quality_Check", and then "Authorize_Refund" at **10:22:18**.

### Conclusion:

"Authorize_Refund" does not **always** immediately precede "Update_Inventory". Cases 1001 and 1003 demonstrate deviations from this pattern.
