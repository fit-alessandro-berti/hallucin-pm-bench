### Decision Points in Contoso’s Flight-Refund Process:  
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision**: Validate eligibility based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport* (e.g., whether the refund claim is justified by flight data or weather conditions).  

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   - **Decision**: Pre-approve the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist* (e.g., confirm the claim aligns with refund eligibility criteria).  

3. **High-value refund threshold check**  
   - **Decision**: If the refund amount is **greater than €1,000**, route the case to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (a conditional branch in the process).
