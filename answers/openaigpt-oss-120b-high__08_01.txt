**Answer: Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**  

A concrete firing sequence from the initial marking is  

```
M0 ──T1──► M1 ──T2──► M2 ──T5──► M3
```

where the markings are

| Marking | p0 | p1 | p2 | p3 | p4 | p5 | p6 |
|---------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| **M0** (initial) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **M1** after **T1** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **M2** after **T2** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **M3** after **T5** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

**Why the sequence is legal**

1. **T1** is enabled in M0 because the sole token resides in its input place p0.  
   Firing T1 consumes the token from p0 and produces tokens in p1 and p2 (parallel‑split).

2. In **M1** we have a token in p1 and a token in p2.  
   – **T2** (p1 → p3) is enabled because p1 holds a token.  
   – **T3** (p2 → p4) is also enabled, but we may postpone it.

3. **T2** fires, yielding **M2** with a token in p3, while p4 is still empty (no token has been placed there yet).  

4. **T5**’s enabling condition is:  
   * a token in p3 (normal pre‑arc) – satisfied, and  
   * **zero** tokens in p4 (inhibitor arc) – satisfied because p4 = 0.  

   Therefore **T5** is enabled in M2 and can fire. Its firing consumes the token from p3 and deposits a token in p6, giving **M3**.

At **M3** we still have the token that was placed in p2 after T1, so transition T3 may be fired later (producing a token in p4). Thus T5 has indeed fired *before* T3.

Hence, there exists a reachable marking (M2) where T5 is enabled before T3, and the sequence **T1 → T2 → T5** demonstrates that T5 can fire prior to T3.
