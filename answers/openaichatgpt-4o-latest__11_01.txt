**Executive Memo: Reducing Waiting Times in Claims Process**

Based on our 12-month process analysis, the three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:

1. **Request_Documents** – Avg. Wait: 36.5h, 95th Percentile: 120.0h  
   *Action:* Automate reminders to claimants and offer digital upload portals, which historically cut document return times by 25% in similar implementations.

2. **Send_Closure_Letter** – Avg. Wait: 12.2h, 95th Percentile: 44.0h  
   *Action:* Integrate claim status triggers with batch-scheduled letter dispatches to reduce queuing delays, a tactic shown to cut wait by 30%.

3. **Assess_Liability** – Avg. Wait: 7.8h, 95th Percentile: 16.4h  
   *Action:* Prioritize cases with complete documentation using a triage algorithm, an approach proven to reduce waiting by 20–25%.

Implementing these targeted interventions will streamline high-friction points and accelerate overall claim resolution.
