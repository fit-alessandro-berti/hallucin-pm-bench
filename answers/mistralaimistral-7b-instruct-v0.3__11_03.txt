 Executive Memo

Subject: Performance Analysis of Credit Process Activities and Recommendations for Improvement

Dear COO,

I am writing to present an analysis of our credit process activities based on both SLA breaches and high waiting times. The following three activities have been identified as the worst performers:

1. **Risk Review**
   - Exceeds SLA by 300 seconds (5 minutes)
   - Average waiting time: 480 seconds (8 minutes)
   - Recommendation: Investigate the root cause of the prolonged processing time and consider implementing parallel processing or automation to reduce wait times and improve efficiency.

2. **Legal Approval**
   - Exceeds SLA by 600 seconds (10 minutes)
   - Average waiting time: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
   - Recommendation: Examine the current workload and staffing levels during the Legal Approval process to determine if additional resources are needed to meet SLA targets.

3. **Credit Assessment**
   - Exceeds SLA by 160 seconds (2.67 minutes)
   - Average waiting time: 200 seconds (3.33 minutes)
   - Recommendation: Evaluate the efficiency of the Credit Assessment process and consider implementing more efficient assessment methods or tools to reduce wait times and improve throughput.

I recommend that we prioritize these improvements to enhance our overall credit process performance and meet our SLA targets more consistently.

Best Regards,

[Your Name]
