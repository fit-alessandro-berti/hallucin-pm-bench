**Memo to COO: Critical Process Performance Issues**  

Analysis of process data identifies three activities failing SLA targets with excessive waiting times, indicating systemic bottlenecks:  

- **Risk Review**: Avg. throughput (600s) exceeds 300s SLA by **300s**. Waiting time (480s) constitutes 80% of total cycle time.  
- **Legal Approval**: Avg. throughput (900s) exceeds 600s SLA by **300s**. Waiting time (600s) represents 67% of total cycle time.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Avg. throughput (300s) exceeds 240s SLA by **60s**. Waiting time (200s) is 67% of total cycle time.  

**Recommended Actions**:  
• Investigate capacity constraints in Risk Review to reduce 480s waiting time.  
• Review Legal Approval staffing levels to address 600s waiting time bottleneck.  
• Analyze Credit Assessment subprocesses to optimize and lower 200s waiting time.
