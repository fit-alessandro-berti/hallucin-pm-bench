**Answer to Question 1:**  
Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3.  

**Minimal Firing Sequence:**  
T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5.  

**Explanation:**  
After firing T1, T2, T7, and T4, P2 retains its token (from T1), and P5 gains a token (from T4). T5 then consumes both P2 and P5, allowing it to fire before T3. This sequence avoids consuming P2 early, enabling T5 to activate later when P5 is also available.
