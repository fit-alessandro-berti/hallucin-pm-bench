To enforce the 48-hour SLA, attach **Boundary Timer Events** (interrupting) to **Task_Receive**, **Task_Check**, and **Task_RequestDocs**. Configure these timers with a 48-hour duration relative to the **Start_Claim** timestamp. Connect the output of these timer events via new sequence flows directly to **Task_Triage**.

This ensures that if a claim stalls during reception or the documentation phase, the process automatically bypasses the delay and "reaches" the triage stage to satisfy the business rule. This modification utilizes only Events and Sequence Flows, which are not categorized as Activities (Tasks or Subprocesses) in BPMN 2.0, thereby adhering to your constraints while providing a robust, automated escalation trigger.
