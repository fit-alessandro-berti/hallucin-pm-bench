I cannot compute the average cycle time (in hours) of “Approve Invoice”, its standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval from the supplied artefacts because the event log contains no actual event rows and no timestamp values (both `start_time` and `complete_time` are fully redacted). To calculate the cycle time of “Approve Invoice” I would need, at minimum, the per-occurrence timestamps for that activity (either `start_time`/`complete_time` or paired lifecycle events) to derive each instance’s duration, plus the number of observations to compute the mean, standard deviation, and confidence interval; none of these underlying data points are available in the stub, and the SLA catalogue provides only unrelated aggregate KPIs (e.g., “Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice”), not the “Approve Invoice” activity duration distribution.
