No. The fact is not accurate for the given event-log fragment.

- Case 1001: Update_Inventory at 08:25, then Authorize_Refund at 08:30. Authorize_Refund does not occur immediately before Update_Inventory; it occurs after.
- Case 1002: Update_Inventory is absent; sequence is Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued. Cannot observe Authorize_Refund immediately before Update_Inventory here.
- Case 1003: Update_Inventory at 10:08, then Quality_Check at 10:15, then Authorize_Refund at 10:22. Authorize_Refund does not occur before Update_Inventory (and is not immediately before it).

Conclusion: In this fragment, Authorize_Refund never immediately precedes Update_Inventory within the same case; in two cases Update_Inventory precedes Authorize_Refund, and in one case Update_Inventory is absent.
