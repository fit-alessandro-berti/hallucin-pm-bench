Executive Memo: Claims Handling Performance Benchmark

Analyzing the Q1-2025 claims handling metrics, we identified that **Calculate_Payout**, **Review_Documents**, and **Approve_Claim** are the three least efficient processes. 

- **Calculate_Payout** has the highest rework rate (0.8%) and slight SLA breaches (1.2), indicating repeated errors.  
- **Review_Documents** reported the longest processing time (30 minutes), with variability (9) suggesting inconsistent handling.  
- **Approve_Claim** showed the shortest processing but significant SLAs breaches (0.9%) and longer average wait times.

Our recommendation:  
1. **Streamline Claim Calculation** by refining rework checks.  
2. **Optimize Document Review** through automation to reduce time.  
3. **Accelerate Claim Approval** with tighter SLAs.

These actions target the most impactful areas for improvement.
