### Decision Points
- **High-value branch** (after Finance_Controller_PreApprove): If the refund amount is greater than €1 000, the case proceeds to Senior_Auditor_Review (otherwise, skips to Process_Refund_Payment).
- **Pre-Process_Refund_Payment gate** (immediately before Process_Refund_Payment): Finance_Controller_PreApprove must have succeeded **and** (for refunds > €1 000) Senior_Auditor_Review must be completed.
