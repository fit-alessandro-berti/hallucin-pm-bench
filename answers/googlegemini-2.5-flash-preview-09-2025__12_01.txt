The fact is **inaccurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification:**

1.  **Case 1001:** The activity "Update\_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs $\textit{before}$ "Authorize\_Refund" (08:30:02). This contradicts the claim that "Authorize\_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update\_Inventory."

2.  **Case 1003:** The activity "Update\_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs $\textit{before}$ "Authorize\_Refund" (10:22:18). This also contradicts the claim.

(Note: In both Case 1001 and Case 1003, "Update\_Inventory" actually occurs $\textit{immediately}$ before the next step, but that next step is not "Authorize\_Refund" in either case; nor does "Authorize\_Refund" immediately precede "Update\_Inventory" in any case where both occur.)
