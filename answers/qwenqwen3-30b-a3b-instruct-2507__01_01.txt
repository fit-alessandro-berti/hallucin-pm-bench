### **Decision Points in Contoso’s Flight-Refund Process**

The following are the **decision points** in the process, based solely on the defined activities and constraints:

1. **Eligibility Decision**  
   - *Trigger*: After **Customer_Submit_Claim** is completed.  
   - *Decision*: Whether the passenger is eligible for a refund.  
   - *Basis*: Validation against the **FlightManifest** and **WeatherReport**.  
   - *Outcome*: Eligible → Proceed to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**; Not eligible → Process ends (no further steps).

2. **High-Value Threshold Decision**  
   - *Trigger*: After **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** is completed.  
   - *Decision*: Whether the refund amount exceeds €1,000.  
   - *Basis*: The refund amount (implicitly determined post-approval).  
   - *Outcome*:  
     - > €1,000 → Proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review**.  
     - ≤ €1,000 → Proceed directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.

3. **Payment Eligibility Decision**  
   - *Trigger*: Before initiating **Process_Refund_Payment**.  
   - *Decision*: Whether all required approvals and documents are in place.  
   - *Basis*:  
     - **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** has been completed.  
     - If refund > €1,000, **Senior_Auditor_Review** has been completed (including *AuditTrail*).  
   - *Outcome*:  
     - All conditions met → **Process_Refund_Payment** can begin.  
     - Any missing step → Payment is blocked.
