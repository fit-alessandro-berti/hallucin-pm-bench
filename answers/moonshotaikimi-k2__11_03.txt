MEMO – To: COO, Orion Credit  
Subject: Top SLA & Waiting-Time Exposures  

Based on current case data, three activities most threaten customer commitment:

1. Risk Review stands out with a 600 s service-time (100 % above the 300 s SLA) and an additional 480 s of queue time.  
2. Legal Approval records 900 s service-time (50 % over its 600 s SLA) plus 600 s waiting, doubling customer experience loss.  
3. Credit Assessment posts 300 s service-time (25 % overshoot of the 240 s SLA) coupled with 200 s delays, the highest in early onboarding.

• Risk Review – Reduce the review queue by introducing a data-based triage, immediately clearing the 480 s waiting buffer.  
• Legal Approval – Halve idle time by re-allocating 50 % of Legal resources from non-casebacks to pending approvals starting this cycle.  
• Credit Assessment – Apply straight-through data-rule automation to first-touch 30 % of eligible cases, cutting the 200 s waiting average.
