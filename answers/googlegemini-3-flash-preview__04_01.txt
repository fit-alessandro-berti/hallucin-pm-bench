**Non-compliant**

1.  **Violation of Rule 2:** Because the trace contains the activity `Expedite_Flag` (Event 4), a `Risk_Assessment` was required to occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` occurred at Event 8, while `Risk_Assessment` did not occur until Event 9.
2.  **Violation of Rule 3:** After `Goods_Received` (Event 6), the activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (a distance of ≤ 2). In this trace, `Three_way_match` occurred at Event 10. The intervening activities were `Move_to_Quality` (Event 7), `Ship_Goods` (Event 8), and `Risk_Assessment` (Event 9), placing the match at a distance of 4 activities from receipt.

**Note on other rules:**
*   **Rule 1** was respected: `PO_Amount` exceeded €10 000, and approvals by a Procurement Officer (Event 2) and CFO (Event 3) were recorded before `Issue_PO` (Event 5).
*   **Rule 4** was respected: While a "CFO" role (Event 3) and an "Intern" role (Event 7) both appear, the Intern did not *directly follow* the CFO.
*   **Rule 5** was respected: The trace finished with `Archive_Record` (Event 11).
