Non-compliant  
Justifications:  
1. Rule 2(b): The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (at #4). Therefore, `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first `Ship_Goods` activity. However, `Risk_Assessment` (at #9) occurs after `Ship_Goods` (at #8), violating this requirement.  
2. Rule 3: After `Goods_Received` (at #6), `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (positions â‰¤ 8). However, `Three_way_match` (at #10) is executed at position 10, which exceeds the maximum allowed distance of 2 (positions 7 and 8 intervene).
