**Executive Memo**

To: Chief Operating Officer, Orion Credit

The analysis of current process data reveals three activities that consistently miss SLA targets while also exhibiting excessive waiting times, indicating systemic delays for customers.

**Verify Identity**: With an average throughput time of 120 seconds—exceeding the 90-second SLA by 33%—and a waiting time of 80 seconds, this activity creates immediate friction at the application stage. Actions: Implement identity verification during onboarding to pre-populate applicant data, reducing duplicate verification requests.

**Credit Assessment**:Throughput at 300 seconds and waiting time of 200 seconds classified as 125% beyond the 240-second SLA. Recommend deploying automated credit scoring algorithms to prioritize cases within 240 seconds for straightforward applications.

**Risk Review**: With a throughput time of 600 seconds and waiting time of 480 seconds—double the 300-second SLA—this activity experiences the longest delays. Left unaddressed, it delays internal decision-making across 480 cases. Consider introducing overnight batch processing for standard risk cases to compress turnaround time.

These targeted interventions will restore SLA compliance while reducing customer wait times.
