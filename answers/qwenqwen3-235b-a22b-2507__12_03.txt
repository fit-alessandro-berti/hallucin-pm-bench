**1. No**

**2. Justification:**

The FACT claims that **“Validate_Payment” always occurs immediately after “Receive_Order,” with no other activities in between.** However, the event log contains at least two counterexamples:

- **CaseID C002**:  
  Sequence:  
  - Receive_Order (2025-01-03T09:30:00)  
  - **Pack_Items (2025-01-03T09:50:00)** ← This occurs *before* Validate_Payment  
  - Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:05:00)  
  → There is an intervening activity (**Pack_Items**) between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment”.

- **CaseID C004**:  
  Sequence:  
  - Receive_Order (2025-01-03T10:05:00)  
  - **Check_Fraud (2025-01-03T10:07:00)** ← This occurs *before* Validate_Payment  
  - Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:20:00)  
  → There is an intervening activity (**Check_Fraud**) between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment”.

Additionally, in **CaseID C001**, while Validate_Payment follows Receive_Order directly (at first glance), the sequence is:
- Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items — this one *does* follow the pattern.

But **C002 and C004** definitively violate the “always” condition stated in the FACT.

Therefore, the FACT is **not accurate**.
