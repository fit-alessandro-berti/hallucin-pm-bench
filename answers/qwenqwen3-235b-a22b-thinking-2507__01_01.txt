### Summary of Decision Points in Contoso Airlines' Flight-Refund Process  
Contoso’s non-standard refund process contains **three explicit decision points**, as defined in the provided process description. Each decision point is derived solely from the activities and constraints specified; no additional activities or artefacts (e.g., the deprecated "CustomerService_Agent_Decide") are included.  

1. **Eligibility Validation Decision (during Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility)**:  
   - The triage agent decides whether the refund claim is eligible by validating it against the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*. This decision determines if the claim proceeds to the Finance_Controller_PreApprove step. If ineligible, the claim is likely rejected (though rejection handling is not detailed in the process description, so only the eligibility decision is summarized).  

2. **Pre-Approval Decision (during Finance_Controller_PreApprove)**:  
   - The finance controller decides whether to sign off on the refund using the *EligibilityChecklist*. This decision is binary (approve or reject) and must succeed before Process_Refund_Payment can begin. For high-value claims, this decision must be followed by Senior_Auditor_Review before payment processing.  

3. **High-Value Refund Decision (at the High-value branch)**:  
   - A decision is made based solely on whether the refund amount exceeds **€1,000**. If true, the case proceeds to Senior_Auditor_Review (requiring the *AuditTrail*); if false, the process skips this review and routes directly toward Process_Refund_Payment. This decision point is implicit in the branch condition and is evaluated after Finance_Controller_PreApprove (as per constraints), but no specific role is assigned—it is a data-driven condition based on the refund amount.  

### List of All Required Documents  
The following documents are explicitly required in the process description for specific activities. None are inferred or added beyond the definition provided. Each document is listed with its associated process step:  

- **RefundRequestForm** (required for *Customer_Submit_Claim*)  
- **FlightManifest** (required for *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*)  
- **WeatherReport** (required for *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*)  
- **EligibilityChecklist** (required for *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*)  
- **AuditTrail** (required for *Senior_Auditor_Review* in high-value claims)  
- **BankTransferAuthorization** (required for *Process_Refund_Payment*; must be signed)  
- **RefundConfirmationPDF** (required for *Issue_Confirmation_Letter*)  

This list is exhaustive and based strictly on the process description; no additional documents (e.g., internal logs or unstated forms) are included.
