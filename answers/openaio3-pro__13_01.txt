1. Count of “Manual_Fraud_Check”: 1 occurrence.

   (1 ÷ 18) × 100 = 5.56 %.

3. Case(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”: A1002.

4. Why a monthly estimate drawn from this fragment is unreliable:  
   • Temporal coverage bias – the fragment spans only a few hours on 1 May, so it may not reflect activity patterns during the rest of the month.  
   • Small-sample/selection bias – only 18 events from 4 cases are included; such a tiny, possibly non-random sample gives a highly volatile estimate of how often manual fraud checks occur.
