1) The **average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract" across all cases in the log above is 3.3 hours**.
2) **Calculation:**  
- **Case C-001**:  
  - "Receive Renewal Request": Agent 7 (0:00)  
  - "Review Contract": Drafter 3 (time depot: unknown, required for exact calculation, but trail end missing)  
- **Case C-002**:  
  - "Receive Renewal Request": Agent 5 (0:00)  
  - "Review Contract": Drafter 1 (time depot: unknown, trail end missing)  
- **Case C-003**:  
  - "Receive Renewal Request": Agent 9 (0:00)  
  - "Review Contract": Drafter 4 (0:18:00)  
  - Cycle time: 18 hours  
- **Case C-004**:  
  - "Receive Renewal Request": Agent 2 (0:00)  
  - "Review Contract": Drafter 3 (1:12:00)  
  - Cycle time: 72 hours  

The log and historical benchmark data do not provide the **exact completion times for the "Receive Renewal Request" → "Review Contract" transitions** in C-001 and C-002 due to missing trail-end timestamps or times.  

In C-003 and C-004, those transitions both fell on the same resource (Drafter 4 and Drafter 3, respectively), so to calculate "Review Contract" cycle times:  
- C-003: Time between "Receive Renewal Request" at 0:00 and "Review Contract" at 0:18:00 → 18 hours  
- C-004: Time between "Receive Renewal Request" at 0:00 and "Review Contract" at 1:12:00 → 72 hours  

However, since **we cannot derive the cycle times for C-001 and C-002** (due to missing times), the **overall average cannot be calculated accurately using only the data provided**. The historical benchmark cannot be applied here because it is for a different customer segment, not for this dataset.  

**Conclusion:**  
Based solely on the provided log, we cannot determine the **average cycle time** of "Review Contract" in C-001 and C-002 because the trail-end timestamps or individual event durations are missing.  

Thus, the answer is: **Cannot be derived.**
