Add an **interrupting boundary timer event** (e.g., `BE_48h`) to `Task_RequestDocs`, set to an absolute deadline of **48 hours from `Start_Claim`** (`timeDate = claimSubmittedAt + PT48H`).  
Route that timer’s flow directly to `Task_Triage` (keep `f6` as the normal path).

Result: if documents are still pending at the 48-hour mark, `Task_RequestDocs` is interrupted, the claim is automatically escalated (via an escalation flag/event on the timer path), and it is pushed into `Task_Triage` immediately. This adds no new tasks and enforces the SLA on the main delay point.
