**MEMORANDUM**

TO: COO, Acme Insurance
FROM: Senior Process-Performance Analyst
DATE: Q1-2025 Claims Performance Analysis

The three worst-performing activities in Claims Handling are:

1. Request_Documents: Throughput of 190 cases/day is significantly lower than other activities, with an extremely high wait time of 150 minutes and concerning rework rate of 22.0%. This creates major bottlenecks downstream.

2. Review_Documents: Low throughput (185 cases/day), high wait time (30 minutes), and lengthy processing time (25 minutes) contribute to a 12.4% SLA breach rate, with high variability (9 minutes) indicating inconsistent processes.

3. Approve_Claim: Despite excellent individual performance metrics, low throughput (182 cases/day) creates a bottleneck that impacts subsequent activities.

**Recommendations:**
- Request_Documents: Implement an automated document request system with pre-populated templates to reduce manual effort and rework.
- Review_Documents: Develop tiered review guidelines and train reviewers to standardize document evaluation, reducing processing time and variability.
- Approve_Claim: Implement parallel processing where multiple approvers can handle claims simultaneously during peak periods to increase throughput.
