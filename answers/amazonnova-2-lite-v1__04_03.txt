### **Justification with Reference to Ruleset R**

#### **Rule 1: Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur once each and in that order.**
- **Violated**
- The trace shows:
  - `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs **before** `Notify_Authorities`
  - `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occurs **after** `Notify_Authorities`
- This violates the **order requirement**: QE must occur **before** RA.  
  **Result:** Rule 1 is **not satisfied**.

#### **Rule 2: If severity = "High", activity `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen after both QE and RA.**
- **Not Applicable (due to prior violation)**
- Although the case attribute is `severity = "High"` and `VP_Safety_Approval` does occur after `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, it **also** appears **before** `Quality_Engineer_Review` is properly ordered before RA.
- Since Rule 1 is violated, the ordering for Rule 2 cannot be correctly assessed, and the trace fails compliance **before** reaching Rule 2 evaluation.  
  **Result:** Rule 2 **cannot be satisfied** due to earlier violation.

#### **Rule 3: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must not occur until after QE and RA are complete.**
- **Violated**
- In the trace:  
  `Notify_Authorities` occurs **after** `Quality_Engineer_Review` but **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.  
- This directly violates Rule 3, because NA occurred **before RA was completed**.  
  **Result:** Rule 3 is **not satisfied**.

#### **Rule 4: `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only after NA (and, if required by rule 2, after VP).**
- **Technically satisfied in ordering, but moot due to prior violations**
- In the trace:
  - `Close_Case` occurs **after** `Notify_Authorities` and **after** `VP_Safety_Approval`
- So, in terms of ordering, Rule 4 is **satisfied**.
- However, because earlier rules (especially Rule 1 and Rule 3) are violated, the overall trace is **non-compliant**.  
  **Result:** Rule 4 is satisfied **but irrelevant** due to earlier failures.

### ✅ **Conclusion**
The execution trace **violates Rules 1 and 3**. Therefore, it is **not compliant** with ruleset R.  
**Answer: No**.
