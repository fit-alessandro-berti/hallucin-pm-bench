**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – Confirm ID card and mobile phone; proceed if successful (no credit history check).  
2. **Impact Assessment** – Community Impact Assessment (CIA) by an Impact Officer; decision to proceed based on community impact.  
3. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – Compare the two independent risk scores assigned by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B; if scores differ by ≤ 2 points, continue; if not, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision.  
4. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** – Collect at least 3 local references; evaluate feedback quality and completeness.  
5. **Amount Threshold Decision** –  
   - If amount < €15,000, auto-approve.  
   - If amount ≥ €15,000, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).  
6. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – Board votes to approve or reject (applicable only for amounts ≥ €15,000).
