**TO:** Chief Operating Officer  
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**SUBJECT:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Brief & Recommendations

This memo outlines the three worst-performing activities in the Q1 Claims Handling process, with data-driven recommendations for each.

1.  **Request Documents:** This activity is the process's primary bottleneck. Its 22% rework rate is exceptionally high, leading to a severe backlog indicated by the 150-minute average wait time.
    *   **Action:** Implement standardized document checklists for different claim types to ensure all required information is captured on the first attempt, directly targeting the high rework rate.

2.  **Review Documents:** This activity drives the most SLA violations, with a 12.4% breach rate. This is caused by its long and unpredictable execution, having the highest average processing time (25 min) and variability (9 min).
    *   **Action:** Pilot an intelligent document processing tool to automate data extraction, reducing manual effort and processing time.

3.  **Initial Assessment:** A queue is forming early in the process, evidenced by the 18-minute average wait time and a drop in throughput from the prior step.
    *   **Action:** Re-allocate staff resources from faster downstream activities (e.g., `Pay_Claim`) to `Initial_Assessment` to increase capacity and reduce the queue.
