The fact is inaccurate because in Case C003, the activity `Validate_Payment` (line 6) occurs before `Receive_Order` (line 7). The claim that `Validate_Payment` always **follows** `Receive_Order` requires that for every case, every instance of `Validate_Payment` must occur after every preceding instance of `Receive_Order` within that case. Case C003 is a counterexample where `Validate_Payment` is the first activity.
