**No**

**Justification:**

The FACT is **not accurate**. The event log contains counterexamples where activities occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":

1. **Case C002**: 
   - Receive_Order (09:30:00) → Pack_Items (09:50:00) → Validate_Payment (10:05:00)
   - **Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment**

2. **Case C004**:
   - Receive_Order (10:05:00) → Check_Fraud (10:07:00) → Validate_Payment (10:20:00)
   - **Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment**

While Cases C001 and C003 do show Validate_Payment immediately following Receive_Order, the presence of intervening activities in C002 and C004 proves the stated FACT is false.
