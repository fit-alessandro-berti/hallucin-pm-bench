The event-log stub provided (Artefact A) contains only column headers with all row entries and timestamp values redacted (e.g., "… redacted…"). No actual data rows exist in the supplied log. Since cycle time calculation for any activity requires start_time and complete_time values for the specific activity ("Approve Invoice"), and zero timestamp data is present, it is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval. The SLA catalogue (Artefact B) references historical averages but does not provide the raw event-log data required for the task. Therefore, no measurable metrics can be derived from the given artefacts.
