1. **No**

2. **Justification:**
The claim that "Validate_Payment" *always* occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" is disproven by the following cases in the log:
*   **CaseID C002:** The activity **"Pack_Items"** occurs between "Receive_Order" (09:30:00) and "Validate_Payment" (10:05:00).
*   **CaseID C004:** The activity **"Check_Fraud"** occurs between "Receive_Order" (10:05:00) and "Validate_Payment" (10:20:00).
