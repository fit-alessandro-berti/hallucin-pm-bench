**No**  

The fact is inaccurate because:  
- For case C003 (lines 6â€“7), *Validate_Payment* (10:43) occurs **before** *Receive_Order* (10:45).  
- For case C005 (line 11), *Validate_Payment* occurs with **no preceding** *Receive_Order* event at all.  

These violations (C003 and C005) contradict the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order*.
