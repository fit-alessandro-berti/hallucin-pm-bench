1.  The activity "Manual Fraud Check" appears **one** time in the excerpt.
2.  This short excerpt may not accurately represent the activity frequencies in the complete March 2025 log.
    *   **Limited Sample Size:** A few cases might not reflect the typical distribution of activities.
    *   **Selection Bias:** The snippet might contain a disproportionate number of cases requiring manual checks (or cases not requiring manual checks).
    *   **Time-Based Variations:** Process behavior can change over time (e.g., different fraud patterns), and this snippet only covers a small time window on a single day.
    *   **Missing Context: Incomplete:** No cases shown are 'rejected', offering a complete view of process possibilities.
