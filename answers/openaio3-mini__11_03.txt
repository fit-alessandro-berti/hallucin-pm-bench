Orion’s COO,

An analysis of our process performance indicates that three activities are underperforming based on both SLA breaches and high waiting times. In detail, the Credit Assessment activity exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds with an average waiting time of 200 seconds, Risk Review exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds with an average waiting time of 480 seconds, and Legal Approval similarly exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds with an average waiting time of 600 seconds.

Recommendations:
• For Credit Assessment, analyze the specific stages causing the 200-second waiting time to reallocate resources and streamline steps.
• For Risk Review, implement targeted process improvements by quantifying wait segments and adjusting workflow prioritization to reduce the 480-second delay.
• For Legal Approval, conduct a detailed review of approval sub-processes to eliminate unnecessary delays contributing to the 600-second waiting time.

These actions are grounded in our current metrics and are aimed at aligning each activity back within its SLA thresholds.
