1️⃣ **1 time**  
Only row 6 (`1002,Manual Fraud Check,complete,2025-03-01T09:07:13Z`) contains the exact string “Manual Fraud Check”.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might overestimate manual fraud check frequency because:  
- The snippet includes *two* activity strings containing “fraud check” but only one matches *exactly* “Manual Fraud Check” (the others are “Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)”);  
- Without context on naming conventions across the full dataset, the analyst may conflate similar activity names (e.g., assume “Fraud Check (Automatic)” is just a variant of “Manual Fraud Check”);  
- The snippet spans only one day and three cases, offering no insight into case-type distributions (e.g., high-risk cases triggering manual checks) or temporal patterns—potentially skewing extrapolation to the full month.
