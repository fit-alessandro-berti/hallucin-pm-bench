1) The average cycle time for "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the provided data.

2) The log does not contain any timestamp or duration data for the "Review Contract" activity. Therefore, it is impossible to calculate its cycle time. The historical benchmark data is explicitly stated as being from a different customer segment and not drawn from this log, so it cannot be used as a substitute.
