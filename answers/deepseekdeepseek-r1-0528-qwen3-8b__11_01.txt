Okay, here is the draft executive memo:

# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Chief Operating Officer (COO)
**FROM:** Senior Process Mining Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Request Processing Performance Anomalies

Three activities show critically high waiting times:

1.  **Request_Documents:** Worst performer, with an average wait of 36.5 hours and a 95th percentile wait of 120 hours.
    *   *Recommendation:* Standardize and clarify required document sets upfront during Initial_Screening (likely the bottleneck blocking this activity). Implement an automated checklist.

2.  **Send_Closure_Letter:** High waiting time, averaging 12.2 hours with a 95th percentile wait of 44 hours.
    *   *Recommendation:* Sequence this activity accurately *after* prior tasks (like payment processing or final approval confirmation). Define clear triggers or use process intelligence data to ensure it waits for the correct downstream completion.

3.  **Assess_Liability:** Third worst, waiting an average of 7.8 hours with a 95th percentile wait of 16.4 hours.
    *   *Recommendation:* Investigate and optimize downstream dependencies causing delays. Ensure required data/query results for liability assessment are available *before* this activity starts or maximize parallel processing opportunities.

Addressing these waiting times directly will significantly improve overall claim process efficiency for the COO.
