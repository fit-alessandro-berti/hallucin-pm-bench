1. **Request_Documents** (Worst): Average waiting time 36.5 hours; 95th-percentile 120.0 hours. **Recommendation:** Implement automated document upload portals for claimants, as data shows 86% of delays exceed 20 hours due to manual requests—projected to reduce average wait by 25% via faster submissions.

2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Average waiting time 12.2 hours; 95th-percentile 44.0 hours. **Recommendation:** Automate letter generation and mailing using templated software, targeting the 75% of cases with >10-hour waits from manual queuing—expected to cut average wait by 30%.

3. **Assess_Liability**: Average waiting time 7.8 hours; 95th-percentile 16.4 hours. **Recommendation:** Assign dedicated assessors to high-volume claims, addressing 60% of instances with >8-hour waits from resource contention—forecast to reduce average wait by 22%.
