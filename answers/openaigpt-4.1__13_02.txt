**1. How many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in the excerpt?**  
- **1** time

---

**2. What percentage of**  
   a) **all events** (48 in total) include that activity?  
   - \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 = 2.08\% \)
  
   b) **all unique cases** (12 in total) include that activity?  
   - \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 = 8.33\% \)

**3. Why can such a low-support activity mislead performance or predictive analyses if we generalise from this slice?**

Since “Manual_Fraud_Check” appears in only 1 out of 48 events and 1 in 12 cases, its impact on overall process duration, routing, or outcomes is minimal in this log excerpt. Generalising from such sparse data may overstate its importance, cause models to incorrectly treat it as typical, or distort performance statistics (e.g., average activity duration or paths). Low-support activities require larger samples to gauge true significance.
