1. **No**

2. Justification:
   - In **Case C002**, the sequence is:  
     `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`.  
     Here, "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment". Thus, the claim that "Validate_Payment" always immediately follows "Receive_Order" is invalidated by this case.
   
   - Additionally, in **Case C004**, the sequence is:  
     `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment`.  
     Here, "Check_Fraud" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment". This further disproves the claim.
