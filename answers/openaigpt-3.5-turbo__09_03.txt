1. To compute the average cycle time of the activity "Approve Invoice" in the event log, we would need the timestamps for when the activity starts and completes for each case. Since these timestamps have been redacted from the provided information, we are unable to calculate the average cycle time.

2. Without the specific timestamps for each "Approve Invoice" activity, we cannot calculate the standard deviation or construct a 95% confidence interval. 

3. The lack of timestamp data in the event log stub prevents us from accurately computing any metrics related to the "Approve Invoice" activity. Time-stamped data is crucial for analyzing cycle times, standard deviations, and confidence intervals.
