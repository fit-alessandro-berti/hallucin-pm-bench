1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" appears exactly 1 time in this excerpt (for CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ This small snippet shows only 3 loan applications (cases) from what is presumably a month-long log from March 2025. While we can see one manual fraud check in these three cases, this sample is too small to reliably estimate the true frequency of manual checks in the full dataset. Additionally, we notice inconsistent activity naming ("Automatic Fraud Check" vs "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), suggesting there might be other variants of fraud check activities that could be manual but named differently in the complete log.
