Over the last 12 months, Orion’s worst waiting-time bottlenecks are:

**#1 Request_Documents** — Avg wait **36.5h**, 95th pct **120.0h**.  
**Action:** Introduce an automated “doc bundle” request at first contact (pre-filled templates + customer portal upload) triggered immediately after **Initial_Screening**; target ≥ **20%** reduction by eliminating back-and-forth cycles for the **275** executions.

**#2 Send_Closure_Letter** — Avg wait **12.2h**, 95th pct **44.0h**.  
**Action:** Auto-generate and auto-send closure letters from claim outcomes (Approve/Reject) with same-day batching (e.g., hourly runs); prioritize the longest-waiting cases to cut tail delays by ≥ **20%** across **255** executions.

**#3 Assess_Liability** — Avg wait **7.8h**, 95th pct **16.4h**.  
**Action:** Implement an SLA-based queue with WIP limits and “oldest-first” routing; add a fast-track lane for low-complexity claims to reduce average waits by ≥ **20%** over **310** executions.
