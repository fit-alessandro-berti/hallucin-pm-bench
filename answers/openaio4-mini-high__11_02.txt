Executive Summary

Analysis of Q1 performance identifies three critical bottlenecks:

1. Request_Documents: With a 150-min average queue time (versus ≤30 min in other steps), a 22% rework rate, and 5.5% SLA breaches, this step stalls case flow.  
   Recommendation: Launch an automated document-submission portal to reduce queue time by ≥50% and cut rework below 10%.

2. Review_Documents: Highest processing time (25 min), high variability (9-min stdev), and 12.4% SLA breaches—the worst across all activities.  
   Recommendation: Implement a standardized review checklist to reduce average processing time by 20% (to 20 min) and variability by 30%.

3. Initial_Assessment: 18-min wait time and 3.2% SLA breaches—the second‐highest delay outside documentation.  
   Recommendation: Reassign one resource from Notify_Customer (1-min wait, 0% breach) to initial assessments, targeting wait under 10 min and breaches below 2%.
