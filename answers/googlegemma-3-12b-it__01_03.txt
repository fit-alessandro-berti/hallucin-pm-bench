Okay, here's a breakdown of Acme Bank's small-business loan approval process, based on the provided description, answering your two questions.

**a) Decision Points (Gates/Conditional Branches) & Rules:**

1. **Step 4: Risk-Based Amount Threshold:** If the risk rating is Low or Medium *and* the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, the application skips the Manual Underwriting Review.
2. **Step 6: TriVote Decision-Gate:** The loan proceeds to the next stage if it receives approval from any two out of the three required roles: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer.

**b) List of Documents (in order of first appearance):**

1. **Form 14B** (Receive-Application)
2. **Scorecard–Cyan** (Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
3. **Scorecard–Magenta** (Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
4. **Scorecard–Yellow** (Tri-Color-Risk-Check)
5. **Deck Memo** (Manual-Underwriting-Review)
6. **Offer Sheet 77** (Prepare-Binding-Offer)
7. **ID Matrix Declaration** (Request-Applicant-Confirmation)
8. **Loan Dossier 2025** (Finalize-Agreement)
