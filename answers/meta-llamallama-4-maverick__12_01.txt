To evaluate the accuracy of the fact, we need to check the order of activities "Authorize_Refund" and "Update_Inventory" within each case.

1. For Case 1001:
   - "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55.
   - "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 08:30:02.
   Since "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Update_Inventory", the fact is not accurate for Case 1001.

2. For Case 1002:
   - There is no "Update_Inventory" recorded.
   The fact cannot be directly assessed because "Update_Inventory" is missing, but it doesn't contradict the fact either.

3. For Case 1003:
   - "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07.
   - "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 10:22:18.
   Since "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Update_Inventory", the fact is not accurate for Case 1003.

The fact is not accurate for Cases 1001 and 1003, as "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Update_Inventory" in both. Therefore, the fact is not supported by the data.
