**1) The requested value cannot be derived from the provided data.**

**2) Explanation:**  
Average cycle time (activity duration) requires timestamp or elapsed‑time data for each instance of the activity (i.e., start and end times or a duration field). The supplied log header explicitly states that **timestamps and elapsed‑time fields have been redacted**. Consequently, no duration information exists for the four instances of “Review Contract” that appear in the log (case_ids C‑001, C‑002, C‑003, and C‑004).  

Additionally, the FY‑2023 historical benchmark provided:
* Pertains to a **different customer segment** and is **not drawn from this log**, and  
* Does **not** include an entry for “Review Contract” (it only covers “Receive Renewal Request,” “Negotiate Terms,” and “Legal Sign‑off”).  

Therefore, there is no basis to calculate or estimate the average duration of “Review Contract” for the cases shown.
