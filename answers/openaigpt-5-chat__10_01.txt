Got it — I’ll replace each legacy phrase with the preferred one exactly as per your vocabulary policy, ensure correct spellings and capitals, and build the RACI table with the four roles as columns.  

Here’s the RACI matrix:

| Activity            | AM | CO | FC | IT |
|---------------------|----|----|----|----|
| Receive Application | **R** |   |   |   |
| KYC Review          |   | **R** |   |   |
| Order Vetting       | **R** |   |   |   |
| Payment Clearance   |   |   | **R** |   |
| Record Update       |   |   |   | **R** |
| Notify Customer     | **R** |   |   |   |

**Legend:**  
- **R** = Responsible (performs the work)  

If you’d like, I can extend this to full RACI definitions (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) and assign A/C/I for each step. Would you like me to produce that more detailed version?
