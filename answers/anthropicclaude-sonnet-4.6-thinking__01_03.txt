## a) Decision Points in Acme's Process

There are **two** decision points:

| # | Name | Location | Rule |
|---|------|----------|------|
| 1 | **Risk-Amount Branch** | After Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) | *If* the risk rating is **Low or Medium AND** the requested amount is **≤ €250,000**, Step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review) is skipped entirely; otherwise Step 5 is mandatory. |
| 2 | **TriVote Decision Gate** | Step 6 | The loan passes if **at least two of the three designated approvers** (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) grant approval; unanimous agreement is not required, but fewer than two approvals blocks the loan. |

## b) All Required Documents — In Order of First Appearance

| Order | Document | Step Where First Required |
|-------|----------|--------------------------|
| 1 | **Form 14B** | Step 1 – Receive-Application |
| 2 | **Scorecard–Cyan** | Step 3 – Tri-Color-Risk-Check |
| 3 | **Scorecard–Magenta** | Step 3 – Tri-Color-Risk-Check |
| 4 | **Scorecard–Yellow** | Step 3 – Tri-Color-Risk-Check |
| 5 | **Deck Memo** | Step 5 – Manual-Underwriting-Review *(conditional)* |
| 6 | **Offer Sheet 77** | Step 7 – Prepare-Binding-Offer |
| 7 | **Signed Offer Sheet 77** | Step 8 – Request-Applicant-Confirmation |
| 8 | **ID Matrix Declaration** | Step 8 – Request-Applicant-Confirmation |
| 9 | **Loan Dossier 2025** | Step 9 – Finalize-Agreement |

> **Note:** The Deck Memo (document #5) is only produced when the Risk-Amount Branch does **not** trigger the skip — i.e., when risk is High, or the amount exceeds €250,000. All other documents are required in every loan cycle.
