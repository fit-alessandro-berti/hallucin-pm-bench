We need a crisp executive memo (<=150 words) that identifies the three worst-performing activities, ranked #1 (worst) → #3, by strictly waiting-time. It must quote both the averages waiting time and the 95th percentile waiting time for each, then recommend one concrete, data-driven action per activity that would cut its waiting time by ≥20%. Data table already provided is list of nine process activities. Among these, three representative activities is the "worst performing by waiting time." The table: waiting time is the 95th percentile. Or might average waiting times etc. The table includes: 

Activity: "Submit_Claim" with average waiting 0.4 and 95th percentile waiting-time 1.2.
"Initial_Screening": 2.1 vs 5.6,
"Request_Documents": 36.5 vs 120,
"Assess_Liability": 7.8 vs 16.4,
"Fraud_Check": 0.9 vs 2.5,
"Approve_Payment": 3.2 vs 9.7,
"Reject_Claim": 0.6 vs 1.8,
"Send_Closure_Letter": 12.2 vs 44.0.

Wait, worst performance activity is defined strictly by waiting time. There are eight numbers? Actually it's nine rows (?) Actually table: 8 rows? Wait, let's count: "Submit_Claims" row is 1, "Initial_Screening" row is 2, "Request_Documents" is row 3, "Assess_Liability" is row 4, "Fraud_Check" is row 5, "Approve_Payment" is row 6, "Reject_Claim" is row 7, "Send_Closure_Letter" row is row 8. Total eight rows. But instruction says three worst-performing activities. Wait statement says "three worst performing activities". Strictly by waiting-time. We measure waiting times by average waiting hours but then quotes for average and 95th percentile. But which one to choose? Instruction says "quotes both the average waiting time and the 95th percentile waiting time", that implies we want to choose the ones with highest waiting times. But "by strictly waiting-time", so obviously the higher waiting times. But the numbers: 
- "Send_Closure_Letter": having average waiting = 12.2 and 95th percentile = 44.0.
- "Request_Documents": average waiting = 36.5, 95th percentile = 120.0.
- "Assess_Liability": average waiting = 7.8, 95th percentile = 16.4 appears less worse compared to "Approve_Payment" average waiting = 3.2, 95th percentile = 9.7, so rank need the three highest. But check initial numbers: 

"Submit_Claim" is too small wait times averages 0.4
"Initial_Screening" = 2.1 average waiting, 5.6 95th percentile waiting average time is not that high.
Next is: "Request_Documents" which has average waiting 36.5 and 95th percentile is huge 120 - Highest waiting times.
"Assess_Liability" next: average waiting=7.8 and 95th percentile=16.4
"Send_Closure_Letter": average wait = 12.2 and 95th=44.0, which is worse than Assess Liabilities. Which is worst?
We are strictly using waiting times. Likely we need to rank them: 
Looking at waiting times:
Evaluate average waiting time:Request_Documents = 36.5, then next highest average is Send_Closure_Letter = 12.2, then next is Assess_Liability = 7.8, then Approve_Payment = 3.2, then Initial_Screening = 2.1, then Fraud_Check = 0.9, etc.
But what is "waiting time" strictly defined? However instruction "by strictly waiting time" might mean the waiting time measure. But then what should be prioritized, i.e the value that "drives process performance"? The table shows Avg_Waiting_h and 95% percentile. The question states "names the three worst performing activities by waiting time", not "by service times." So which ones are the worst? Possibly just use the Avg_Waiting hours as they appear. But then the 95th percentiles are huge for those that have high variance. So I need to decide how to rank them:
- Which has the worst average waiting time? It's Request_Documents with avg 36.5, but then Send_Closure_Letter with avg 12.2, then Assess_Liability with avg 7.8. That would rank Request_Documents #1, then Send_Closure_Letter #2, then Assess_Liability #3, because others are all lower average waiting time. Alternatively, people might consider the 95th percentile waiting times. For Request_Documents is 120, for Send_Closure_Letter is 44, Assess_Liability = 16.4, then Approve_Payment=9.7, etc. So by whichever measure, clear three are the outliers:
Maybe we check the 95th:
Request_Documents stands out: 120.0 hours (if converted to days it is 5 days) because the others are much smaller.
Send_Closure_Letter: 44.0 hours (~1.8 days) is next.
Then Assess_Liability: 16.4 h (~0.68 days) stands out possibly as third worst.
But note there is "Initial_Screening", average waiting time is 2.1, 95th=5.6, which is less significantly high than Assess Liability's 95th percentile. But maybe also "Approve_Payment" average waiting = 3.2 h, 95th=9.7, which is still lower. So I think the three worst are:
Worst: "Request_Documents" (Avg Waiting 36.5 h, 95th percentile 120.0 h)
Second: "Send_Closure_Letter" (Avg waiting 12.2 h, 95th percentile 44.0 h)
Third: "Assess_Liability" (Avg waiting 7.8 h, 95th percentile 16.4 h)
Alternatively, could "SSL" be, Wait check "Send_Closure_Letter" might be next worst average than "Approve_Payment", because 3.2 is smaller? Yes.
I need just three activities must be recommended. 

Thus the activities I key are "Request_Documents", "Send_Closure_Letter", "Assess_Liability" in that descending order of waiting time. But careful: Actually which three? Check average waiting h: 36.5 for Request_Documents, 12.2 for Send_Closure_Letter, 7.8 for Assess_Liability, 3.2 for Approve_Payment. But possibly want also to consider 95 percentile: For Request_Documents it's 120.0, and for Send_Closure_Letter it's 44.0, Assess_Liability is 16.4, Approve_Payment is 9.7. So yes, those three match.

Next step: "quotes both the average waiting time and the 95th percentile waiting time for each." I'll create a bullet-like sentences.

Then also "recommends one concrete, data-driven action per activity that would cut its waiting time by ≥ 20%". The memo must be at most 150 words. Let me think: the question instructs a concise memo, but require each activity has one action. So maybe I'll say: "Activity X with avg wait so and so, with 95th % so and so, we recommend implementing ABC." We want to ensure 20% reduction in wait times. So we can propose actions that are data-driven such as automating document requests, etc.

I'll generate for each:

- Request_Documents: It has an average wait of 36.5h p95 120h. Issues: Document Request process. Action: Implement an automated digital submission process with online form and integration with claim processing. The memo: "Adopt an online platform with integrated scheduling and uploaded attachments triggered by email alerts, reducing manual delays including 20%+ reduction in waiting times."

- Send_Closure_Letter: It has average wait 12.2h and p95 44.0h. Problem: Closure letters presumably being processed manually. Action: Automate email generation and mailing workflows, triggering immediate closure notification once all other processing is completed, thus reducing the waiting time by at least 20%.

- Assess_Liability: It has 7.8h avg wait (p95=16.4h). As it has execution manual? Possibly need to streamline liability assessments, e.g. "implement standardized risk evaluation algorithm reducing decision cycles." Alternatively: "Update liability guidelines and delegate tasks to specialized teams." Possibly not a tool, but a work capacity measure. Alternatively, "Deploy AI-based liability scoring to assess risk, prompting instant action."

I might consider recommending "increase resource allocation" or "implement parallel reviews" but the instruction says "data-driven solution" that lowers waiting time by 20%. Might be possible to increase staff training or consider automation? Wait a minute: The assessed waiting times for liability assessments: Average=7.8 and 95th=16.4. The process might be manual. Therefore, one possible action is to optimize decision-making by deploying an intelligent workflow automation or decision-making criteria or risk scoring. Perhaps I can suggest "introduce a decision-support analytics tool that pre-screens liability documents, prioritizing high-risk claims and cutting waiting times by 20%."

I need to specify one concrete action per activity: not general. And use data-driven words.

I can say:

"For Request_Documents, implement a digital document management system integrated with auto-reminder notifications and electronic document capture, which has historically increased processing speed by 20%."

For Send_Closure_Letter, "Leverage automated email and letter generation module based on claim data to instantly notify claimants upon closure, reducing processing delays by at least 20%."

For Assess_Liability, "Deploy a predictive analytics tool that flags key liability attributes for immediate review, thereby reducing waiting times by 20%."

Let me produce a memo with total words less than or equal to 150 words. Constraint of memo "crisp, executive memo" ≤150 words.  I need to produce a memo that identifies the three worst performing waiting-time activities, ranked from worst to third worst. I need to be succinct.

I can open with: "Memo: Process Improvement Recommendations for Three Worst-Performing Activities" and then list the three activities with bullet points of average and p95 wait times, then my data-driven action. But I'm required to produce an executive memo with at most 150 words, so extra words need to be spare.

We need to produce a memo in plain text, not markdown formatting unless plain text or without bullet formatting code, maybe using proper formatting.

I'll produce an output memo that is self-contained, 40-50 word summary that includes three items. 

I propose the following layout:

"To: COO
From: Senior Process Mining Analyst
Date: [current date]
Subject: Improvement Recommendations for Top Three High Wait Activities

1. Request_Documents: Avg. 36.5h; 95th 120h. Action: Implement an automated digital submission platform with electronic attachments to cut manual delays.
2. Send_Closure_Letter: Avg. 12.2h; 95th 44.0h. Action: Adopt an automated notification system for immediate closure letters, shortening processing cycles.
3. Assess_Liability: Avg. 7.8h; 95th 16.4h. Action: Deploy predictive analytics for risk screening to prioritize claims faster.
These concrete steps—based on data analysis—should reduce waiting times by at least 20% per activity."

But must be limited to ≤150 words. I'll then produce final memo accordingly.

I'll produce final answer. Each bullet point includes a concise line with both quotations, as specific details. I'll ensure grammar and word count. 

Let me count words now: 

I'll produce a memo of about 100 words maybe.

I'll produce a final output with careful language. 

Remember: only discuss listed activities from table, do not mention service time or throughput. So I must only mention waiting times.

I'll produce a final memo. We'll produce final output as a plain text listing items or with numbered list.

I'll ensure the mention "action" should be "one concrete, data-driven action per activity."

I'll produce text in a style that is crisp. 

I'll attempt to produce a final answer that is less than 150 words. I'd produce either 80-100 words. I'll produce concise bullet lines.

I'll produce final answer:

'/>'

I'll produce final answer.Memo to COO

Based on our 12‑month data, the three activities with the longest waiting times are:

1. Request_Documents – Avg. 36.5h; 95th 120.0h.
2. Send_Closure_Letter – Avg. 12.2h; 95th 44.0h.
3. Assess_Liability – Avg. 7.8h; 95th 16.4h.

To reduce each by ≥20%:
• Request_Documents: Implement an automated document capture platform with instant upload and electronic notifications.
• Send_Closure_Letter: Activate an automated email/letter generation tool that instantly triggers post–processing messaging.
• Assess_Liability: Deploy a predictive analytics engine to pre-screen and prioritize liability cases, reducing manual review delays.

These targeted, data-driven actions will streamline waiting times while maintaining our current service standards.
