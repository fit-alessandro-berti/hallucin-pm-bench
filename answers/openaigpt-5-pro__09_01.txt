1) Cannot be derived from the provided data.

2) The event log excerpt contains only case_id, activity, and resource; all timestamps and elapsed-time fields are redacted. Without start and completion times (or an explicit duration) for each “Review Contract” occurrence, its cycle time cannot be calculated. The historical benchmarks supplied are for different activities and a different segment, so they cannot be used to infer “Review Contract.” If timestamps were available, the method would be: for each “Review Contract” event, compute duration = complete_time − start_time (or use the provided elapsed duration), then average these durations across the four occurrences shown.
