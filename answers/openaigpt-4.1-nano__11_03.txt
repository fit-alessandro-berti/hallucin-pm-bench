Subject: Performance Analysis of Key Application Activities  

The analysis identifies the three activities with the most significant SLA breaches combined with high waiting times: Risk Review, Credit Assessment, and Verify Identity. Risk Review exceeds its SLA by 180 seconds (600 vs. 300 target) and has a high average waiting time of 480 seconds, indicating significant delays. Credit Assessment surpasses its SLA by 60 seconds (300 vs. 240 target), with an average waiting time of 200 seconds. Verify Identity exceeds its SLA by 30 seconds (120 vs. 90 target), with an 80-second waiting time.  

Recommendations:  
• Risk Review: Streamline the review process using automation to reduce throughput and waiting time.  
• Credit Assessment: Implement process optimization to accelerate decision-making steps.  
• Verify Identity: Enhance authentication procedures to decrease verification time and reduce delays.
