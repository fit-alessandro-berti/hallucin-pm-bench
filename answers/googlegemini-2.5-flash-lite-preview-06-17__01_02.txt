Here's a summary of the decision points and a list of all required documents for Acme Bank's Micro-loan Fast-Track process:

**Decision Points:**

*   **Underwriter Alignment Gate:** A decision is made whether the risk scores assigned by Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by more than 2 points. If they do, escalation to the Harmonisation Committee is required.
*   **Amount Threshold Decision:** A decision is made based on the loan amount. If the amount is less than €15,000, the system auto-approves. If the amount is €15,000 or greater, the application proceeds to the Micro-loan Board for approval.

**Required Documents at Submission Time:**

*   Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
*   Proof of Address (≤ 3 months old)
*   Latest Income Statement (single pay-stub or tax slip)
*   Community Impact Statement (CIS) template
*   Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet
*   Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)
