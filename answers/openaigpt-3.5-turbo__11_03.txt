Memo:

Dear COO,

Based on the data provided, the three worst-performing activities in terms of both SLA breaches and high waiting time are as follows:

1. Legal Approval 
   - SLA Target: 600 seconds
   - Actual Average Waiting Time: 600 seconds
   - Exceeds SLA by: 0 seconds 

2. Risk Review 
   - SLA Target: 300 seconds
   - Actual Average Waiting Time: 480 seconds
   - Exceeds SLA by: 180 seconds 

3. Credit Assessment 
   - SLA Target: 240 seconds
   - Actual Average Waiting Time: 200 seconds
   - Exceeds SLA by: 40 seconds 

Recommendations:
- For Legal Approval: Streamline the approval process by implementing automated workflows to reduce waiting time. 
- For Risk Review: Increase the capacity of risk assessment teams to handle cases more efficiently and reduce waiting time. 
- For Credit Assessment: Conduct a detailed analysis to identify bottlenecks in the assessment process and implement solutions to improve efficiency.

[Your Name] Senior Process-Performance Analyst at Orion Credit
