As a senior process-mining analyst strictly adhering to the provided data:

1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the commonness of manual fraud checks because the excerpt is an extremely limited sample. It covers only three unique cases (1001, 1002, 1003) and a small time window on March 1st. In this tiny dataset, "Manual Fraud Check" appears only once, while "Automatic Fraud Check" or "Fraud Check (Automatic)" appear twice. This disproportionate representation within a minuscule sample provides an unreliable basis to infer overall frequencies. The full month-long log likely contains thousands of cases across many days, meaning this snippet is unrepresentative of the process's true execution patterns and the actual frequency of manual checks across the entire month.
