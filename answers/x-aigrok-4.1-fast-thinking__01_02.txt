### Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: If the two risk scores (from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B) differ by ≤ 2 points, continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC); else, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision, then continue.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: If amount < €15 000, the system auto-approves; if amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: Board votes *approve* or *reject*.
