Add an event-based gateway after `Start_Claim` with two branches: a 48-hour timer event and a message catch event. After `Task_Triage`, add a message throw event signaling "TriageReached". If the timer expires first, trigger auto-escalation (e.g., via an existing escalation signal path). This monitors SLA without new tasks, using timer and message events to cancel early if Triage is met on time.
