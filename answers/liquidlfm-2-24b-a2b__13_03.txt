1️⃣ The activity **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ The snippet contains only three cases (CaseIDs 1001–1003). Case 1002 has one “Manual Fraud Check,” but the excerpt is too short and early in the dataset to represent the full month. An analyst might assume manual checks are rare or absent if no further cases appear, or overestimate their frequency if they misinterpret limited data as typical. The sample size is insufficient to generalize about the entire month.
