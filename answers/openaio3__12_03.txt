1. No.

2. In several cases another activity occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment,” contradicting the claim.

• Case C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment  
  (“Pack_Items” intervenes before “Validate_Payment.”)

• Case C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment  
  (“Check_Fraud” intervenes before “Validate_Payment.”)

Only cases C001 and C003 have “Validate_Payment” immediately after “Receive_Order,” so the rule is not universally true.
