**Answer: Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**  

A concrete reachable firing sequence from the initial marking  

```
M0 :  p0 = 1 ,  p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = p5 = p6 = 0
```

is  

```
1.  fire T1   (p0 → p1 + p2)        →  p1=1 , p2=1
2.  fire T2   (p1 → p3)            →  p3=1 , p1=0 , p2=1
3.  fire T5   (p3 –|p4 → p6)       →  p6=1 , p3=0 , p2=1
```

**Why this works**

* After step 1 the net contains one token in **p1** and one token in **p2**; **p4** is still empty.
* Step 2 moves the token from **p1** to **p3**. Now the marking is  

  `p2 = 1 , p3 = 1 , p4 = 0` (all other places are 0).  

  The inhibitor arc of **T5** looks at **p4** – it sees *zero* tokens, so the inhibitor condition is satisfied.
* Step 3 fires **T5**. Its normal input arc consumes the token from **p3**, and because the inhibitor condition holds (p4 = 0) the transition is enabled. It produces a token in **p6** and leaves **p2** untouched.

At the moment **T5** fires, **T3** has never been enabled (the token that would enable it sits in **p2**, not yet moved to **p4**). Hence **T5** indeed fires *before* **T3**.

Thus the net admits a reachable marking where **T5** is enabled and can fire prior to any firing of **T3**. The sequence `T1 → T2 → T5` demonstrates this.
