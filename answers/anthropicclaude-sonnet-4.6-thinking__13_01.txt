### 4. Two Sampling-Related Reasons the Monthly Estimate Is Unreliable

1. **Insufficient sample size (too few cases).** The fragment contains only **4 cases and 18 events**, all observed within a single morning (~5 hours). With such a small *n*, the observed rate of 1-in-18 carries extremely high statistical uncertainty—a single additional or missing fraud check would swing the estimate by over 5 percentage points. There is nowhere near enough data to produce a stable monthly frequency estimate.

2. **Non-representative time window (temporal bias / lack of coverage).** All 18 events occur on a **single day (2025-05-01)** during a narrow time window. A month contains ~30 days with varying volumes, day-of-week patterns, seasonal fraud spikes, and operational differences (e.g., weekends, holidays, month-end surges). Extrapolating from one morning's slice systematically ignores this variability, making any monthly projection potentially far off in either direction.
