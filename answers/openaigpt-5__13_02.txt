- a) 2.08% of all events (1/48)
- b) 8.33% of unique cases (1/12)

3) Because Manual_Fraud_Check appears once (1/48 events; 1/12 cases), treating it as representative can inflate or misattribute throughput times and path probabilities. Predictive models trained on this slice may overfit to a single rare pattern, misclassify future cases, and bias resource forecasts. KPIs like average steps per case or median cycle time could be skewed by this outlier behavior.
