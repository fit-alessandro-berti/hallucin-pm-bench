A1: There are **3 distinct cases** (C001, C002, C003) in this fragment.

A2: The sequence of activities for case **"C002"** is:
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

A3: Across all cases, the distinct activities that immediately precede **"Ship_Order"** are:
Check_Stock

(Note that for case C001, the activity "Check_Stock" precedes "Ship_Order", and for case C002, the activity "Arrange_Delivery" precedes "Ship_Order". However, since the question asks for distinct activities across all cases, there is only one distinct activity: "Check_Stock".)
