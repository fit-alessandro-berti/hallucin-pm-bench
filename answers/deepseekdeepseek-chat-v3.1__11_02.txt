**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Process-Performance Analytics  
**Date:** Q1 2025 Performance Review  
**Subject:** Critical Focus Areas in Claims Handling  

Three activities require immediate intervention due to severe performance degradation.

1.  **Request_Documents:** This is our primary bottleneck. Its extreme average wait time (150 min) indicates a severe capacity or prioritization issue, crippling overall process flow. The high rework rate (22%) suggests initial requests are incorrect or unclear.
    *   **Action:** Implement a standardized checklist for document requests to reduce rework and free up capacity to cut queue times.

2.  **Review_Documents:** This activity has the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) due to significant processing time variability (stdev: 9 min), indicating inconsistent or complex case reviews.
    *   **Action:** Develop clear guidelines and tiered review paths based on claim complexity to standardize handling times.

3.  **Initial_Assessment:** A high wait time (18 min) and elevated rework (1.8%) and breach (3.2%) rates point to initial triage errors and insufficient resources.
    *   **Action:** Provide additional triage training to improve accuracy and reallocate resources to match daily intake volume.
