Compliant

1.  Rule 1 states that POs exceeding €10,000 require two approvals: Procurement Officer and CFO, *before* `Issue_PO`. Trace 24-EXP shows `PO_Amount` = €12,300, and approvals by `Procurement_Officer` and `CFO` occur *before* `Issue_PO`.
2.  Rule 2 states that if `Expedite_Flag` is present, `Quality_Check` is optional, and `Risk_Assessment` *must* occur before `Ship_Goods`. Trace 24-EXP includes `Expedite_Flag`, and `Risk_Assessment` occurs before `Ship_Goods`.
3.  Rule 3 states that `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities after `Goods_Received`. In Trace 24-EXP, `Goods_Received` (7) is followed by `Move_to_Quality` (7) and then `Ship_Goods` (8), then `Risk_Assessment` (9), and finally `Three_way_match` (10), which is within the two activity timeframe (distance ≤ 2).
4.  Rule 4 states that no activity performed by an `Intern` may *directly follow* an activity by the `CFO`. In Trace 24-EXP, `Move_to_Quality` is performed by `Intern` (7) and `Approve_PO_CFO` was performed by `CFO` (3). The `Move_to_Quality` does not directly follow the `Approve_PO_CFO`.
5.  Rule 5 states the trace must finish with `Archive_Record` and contain nothing after it. Trace 24-EXP finishes with `Archive_Record` (11) and contains nothing afterward.
