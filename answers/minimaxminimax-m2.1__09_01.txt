## Question 1: Average Cycle Time of "Review Contract"

**The requested value cannot be derived from the available data.**

## Explanation

To calculate the average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract," I would need the elapsed time or timestamp data for each occurrence of this activity in the event log. While the log contains the activity names and resources, the timestamps and elapsed-time fields have been explicitly **redacted** in the header information provided.

The historical benchmark (FY-2023) includes average durations for "Receive Renewal Request" (0.8 h), "Negotiate Terms" (7.2 h), and "Legal Sign-off" (1.1 h), but it does **not** include the duration for "Review Contract." Furthermore, the benchmark originates from a different customer segment and is explicitly stated as "not drawn from this log," so it cannot be reliably applied to derive this value.

**What the data shows:** "Review Contract" appears in 4 cases (C-001, C-002, C-003, C-004), but without duration information, a cycle time calculation is not possible from this log.
