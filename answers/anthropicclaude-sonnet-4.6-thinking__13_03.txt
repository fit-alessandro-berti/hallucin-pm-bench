## 1️⃣ Exact count of **"Manual Fraud Check"**

**1 occurrence** — solely in Case 1002 at `2025-03-01T09:07:13Z`.

> All other fraud-check entries use different strings: `"Automatic Fraud Check"` (Case 1001) and `"Fraud Check (Automatic)"` (Case 1003) — neither matches exactly.

## 2️⃣ Why misestimation is likely (≤ 120 words)

Several factors distort the picture:

- **Tiny sample**: only 3 cases from a single morning of a 31-day log — far too small to infer monthly frequency reliably.
- **Label inconsistency**: the log already shows *two* differently named automatic-check activities. There may be additional spellings of manual checks (`"Manual_Fraud_Check"`, `"Fraud Check (Manual)"`, etc.) elsewhere in the month that an exact-string search would miss entirely.
- **Survivorship/ordering bias**: the snippet may not be a random draw; it could represent only the earliest cases, which may skew toward a particular workflow path.
- **Missing cases**: Case 1002 has no `Archive` event yet, suggesting the excerpt is **incomplete**, so even these 3 cases aren't fully represented.
