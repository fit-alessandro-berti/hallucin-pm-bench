### Summarised Changes for Acme Bank’s *Loan_Process*

• **Added tasks**  
  Task_VerifyIdentity: Verify Identity  
  Task_RequestDocs: Request Additional Documents  
  Task_FinalReject: Final Reject  

• **Removed tasks**  
  Task_RejectLoan: Reject Loan  

• **Gateway-type changes**  
  Gateway_Decision changed from Exclusive to Inclusive  

---

**Rationale**:  
- **Added tasks**: `Task_VerifyIdentity`, `Task_RequestDocs`, and `Task_FinalReject` appear in v2 but not v1 (based on element IDs; names are included for context but cosmetic renamings are irrelevant here).  
- **Removed tasks**: `Task_RejectLoan` exists in v1 but is absent in v2 (ID mismatch; the similar `Task_FinalReject` in v2 is a new task).  
- **Gateway-type changes**: `Gateway_Decision` retains the same ID but changes from `exclusiveGateway` (v1) to `inclusiveGateway` (v2). Name changes ("Eligible?" → "Eligibility Check") are cosmetic and ignored.  

*Note: All other differences (e.g., sequence flow renumbering, task name updates like `Task_ApproveLoan` "Approve Loan" → "Auto-Approve Loan", or XML attribute reordering) are cosmetic/reordering and excluded per instructions.*
