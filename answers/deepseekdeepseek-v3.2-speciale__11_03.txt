Subject: Critical Process Bottlenecks and Recommended Actions  

Our analysis of the loan origination process identifies three activities with severe SLA breaches and high waiting times, based on total excess time across cases.  

**Risk Review** averages 600s throughput against a 300s SLA, exceeding by 300s (100%), with waiting time of 480s (80% of total). **Legal Approval** averages 900s vs 600s SLA, exceeding by 300s (50%), waiting 600s (67%). **Credit Assessment** averages 300s vs 240s SLA, exceeding by 60s (25%), waiting 200s (67%). These three activities account for the largest total excess seconds, indicating major bottlenecks.  

To address these issues, I recommend:  

- **Risk Review:** Increase reviewer capacity; actual work time is only 120s, so adding one FTE can reduce waiting by at least 300s to meet SLA.  
- **Legal Approval:** Implement a triage system where standard contracts are pre-screened by junior staff, aiming to cut waiting time by 300s.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Automate routine checks (e.g., income, debt ratios) to reduce processing time from the current 100s, thereby lowering waiting time proportionally.  

These targeted actions directly tackle excessive waiting and will restore SLA compliance.
