Subject: Performance Analysis of Key Activities and Recommended Actions  

To: COO  

The analysis of operational activities highlights three critical performance issues requiring immediate attention. The worst-performing activities, based on SLA breaches and high waiting times, are:  

1. **Legal Approval**: Exceeds SLA by **300 seconds** (900s vs. 600s target).  
2. **Risk Review**: Exceeds SLA by **300 seconds** (600s vs. 300s target).  
3. **Credit Assessment**: Exceeds SLA by **60 seconds** (300s vs. 240s target).  

Recommended actions to address these issues:  
- **Legal Approval**: Implement automated document review tools to reduce throughput time by 33% (target: 600s).  
- **Risk Review**: Deploy AI-driven risk-scoring systems to halve processing time (target: 300s).  
- **Credit Assessment**: Optimize underwriting workflows via API integrations to achieve 20% faster processing (target: 240s).  

These steps aim to align performance with SLA targets and improve customer experience.
