Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants me to summarize every decision point in Contoso Airlines' flight-refund process and list all the required documents. They also specified not to introduce any activities or artifacts not mentioned in the given process.

First, I need to understand what a decision point is. From what I recall, a decision point in a business process is a stage where a choice must be made, typically based on certain criteria or conditions. These decisions can affect the flow of the process.

Looking at the process description:

1. **Customer_Submit_Claim**: The customer submits a RefundRequestForm. This seems like an initial step without any decisions.
   
2. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: The triage agent checks the claim against the FlightManifest and WeatherReport. Here, the agent is validating eligibility, which likely involves deciding whether the claim meets the initial criteria. So, this might be a decision point where the agent determines if the claim is eligible based on the provided documents.

3. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: The finance controller signs off using an EligibilityChecklist. This seems like an approval step. The decision here would be whether the controller approves the refund based on the checklist. So, another decision point.

4. **High-value branch**: It states that if the refund amount is >€1000, it goes to Senior_Auditor_Review. The Senior_Auditor_Review requires an AuditTrail. This looks like a conditional path. The decision here is whether the refund amount exceeds €1000, which determines the next steps. This is a clear decision point based on the refund amount.

5. **Process_Refund_Payment**: This step requires the signed BankTransferAuthorization and can only proceed after Finance_Controller_PreApprove and, if applicable, Senior_Auditor_Review. It doesn't seem like a decision point but an action step once conditions are met.

6. **Issue_Confirmation_Letter**: The system emails a confirmation. Again, an action step, not a decision point.

Now, about the decision points:
- **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: Decides if the claim is initially eligible based on FlightManifest and WeatherReport.
- **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: Decides to pre-approve based on the EligibilityChecklist.
- The **High-value branch** is a conditional decision based on the refund amount (if >€1000), leading to Senior_Auditor_Review.
- Note: The constraint mentions that Process_Refund_Payment can only start after Finance_Controller_PreApprove (and Senior_Review if high-value). But this seems more like a sequence flow condition rather than a decision point in the process model.

Next, required documents. Let's list out all documents mentioned:
- RefundRequestForm (from step 1)
- FlightManifest (referenced in step 2)
- WeatherReport (step 2)
- EligibilityChecklist (step 3)
- AuditTrail (step 4, but only required if high-value)
- BankTransferAuthorization (step 5)
- RefundConfirmationPDF (step 6, which is an output document, not sure if it's required as an input)

Wait, the user asks for required documents. The output document (RefundConfirmationPDF) is generated by the process, so maybe not counted as "required" in terms of inputs. The required documents would be those needed to perform the process steps. Let me list:

- RefundRequestForm (submitted by customer)
- FlightManifest (for validation in step 2)
- WeatherReport (for validation in step 2)
- EligibilityChecklist (used in step 3)
- AuditTrail (required only if high-value, for step 4)
- BankTransferAuthorization (needed in step 5)

The BankTransferAuthorization is mentioned as needing to be present for the refund to process. The RefundConfirmationPDF is an output, so probably not required as input.

So, compiling the decision points and documents:

**Decision Points:**
1. The triage agent must decide during validation whether the claim is eligible (based on FlightManifest and WeatherReport).
2. The finance controller must decide during pre-approval if the claim meets the checklist criteria.
3. A conditional check (decision) is made: if the refund amount >€1000, the case goes to Senior_Auditor_Review.
4. The Senior_Auditor_Review would involve a decision (approve/reject) based on the audit trail, but the process doesn't specify the decision, just that it must include the audit trail. Hmm, but the user's definition of "decision point" might include only the conditional branching, not individual approvals.

Looking back at the process: The High-value branch is explicit as a decision point based on the amount. The validation and pre-approval steps inherently involve decisions based on the documents provided.

**Required Documents:**
- Online RefundRequestForm
- Flight Manifest
- Weather Report
- Eligibility Checklist
- Bank Transfer Authorization (signed)
- Audit Trail (only if high-value claim)

The RefundConfirmationPDF is generated, so it's not a required input document. 

Also, note that the process mentions "the case proceeds to Senior_Auditor_Review, which must include the *AuditTrail*" — so the AuditTrail is necessary for that step. And step 5 needs the BankTransferAuthorization.

Finalizing:

**Decision Points:**
1. **Eligibility Validation**: Deciding if the claim is valid based on FlightManifest and WeatherReport.
2. **Pre-approval Decision**: Finance controller signs off using the EligibilityChecklist.
3. **High-value Check**: Determining if the refund amount exceeds €1000, necessitating Senior_Auditor_Review.
4. **Audit Review Decision**: For high-value claims, the senior auditor reviews the AuditTrail (though the process doesn't explicitly state an approval decision here, it's implied that the review leads to a decision to proceed or not).

**Required Documents:**
1. RefundRequestForm (in step 1)
2. FlightManifest (step 2)
3. WeatherReport (step 2)
4. EligibilityChecklist (step 3)
5. AuditTrail (step 4, only if high-value)
6. BankTransferAuthorization (signed, step 5)

I need to ensure I don't include any elements not mentioned. The constraint says not to include "CustomerService_Agent_Decide," which isn't in the process, so that's fine. Also, the High-value decision point is explicitly mentioned, so that should be included.

So, summarizing decision points as per the process:

1. Decision during Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility: is the claim eligible based on documents?
2. Decision during Finance_Controller_PreApprove: does it meet checklist criteria?
3. Is the refund amount >€1000? (branching decision)
4. If high-value, Senior_Auditor_Review is performed, which would involve a decision, but the process doesn't specify; it only says the review must include the AuditTrail. So the first three are the main decision points, with possibly the audit review being an implied decision point.

Wait, the user's process does have the Senior_Auditor_Review as a step. Although not explicitly mentioned as a "decision" step, moving forward from this would likely require a decision. However, based on the given process, we should stick strictly to what's stated. The explicit decisions are in the triage validation, finance pre-approval, and the high-value branch decision. Additionally, the constraint about Process_Refund_Payment can only begin after certain steps, but that's a constraint, not necessarily a decision point.

What the user defined as =, the branching condition is explicitly stated as a decision point.

Therefore, the main decision points are:

1. **Triage Validation Decision**: Is the claim eligible upon initial screening?
2. **Pre-approval Decision**: Does the claim meet the finance checklist criteria?
3. **High-value Determination**: Does the refund exceed €1000?
4. **Audit Review**: Senior auditor’s assessment if high-value. (This is implied because the review would decide to proceed. But the given steps stop at including the audit trail, not the decision per se.)

The process says "Senior_Auditor_Review, which must include the AuditTrail" — so it's a required artifact, but the process doesn't state that this step rejects claims. However, since it's a review, it's logical to assume that the outcome is binary. But sticking to the given info, it's safer to include the first three decisions and the high-value branch as decision points.

But the branch itself is a decision point (gateway) based on the amount. So perhaps decisions are:

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility (Approval)**
2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove (Approval)**
3. **Amount >€1000? (Branching Decision)**
4. **Senior_Auditor_Review (final approval for high-value claims)**

But the constraint says that for high-value, the Senior_Auditor_Review must be completed before payment. The process doesn't say the review could result in rejection, so perhaps the review is a mandatory step for high-value claims. However, it's still a decision-intensive step.

For the required documents, the AuditTrail is needed only for high-value claims, so it's conditional. Should it be listed as required but with a note? The user asked to list all required documents, so including them with a condition might be useful.

In summary, the decision points where conditions are explicitly checked:

1. Eligibility during Triage (based on FlightManifest and WeatherReport)
2. Finance Pre-approval (based on EligibilityChecklist)
3. Checking if refund amount >€1000
4. For high-value claims, completion of Senior_Auditor_Review (the process doesn't state that this step can reject, so maybe the decision is ensured completion? Not sure. This might not be a decision point per se, rather a conditional step.)

The user might be expecting the following decisions:
- During Triage: Valid or invalid claim
- During Finance Pre-approval: Approved or not
- Branching based on amount: Yes or No (leads to needing Senior Review)
- Senior Auditor Review: Passed or failed (if applicable)

But need to stick to what's given. The Senior_Auditor_Review step is required if amount >€1000, and the step must include the AuditTrail, but the process doesn't specify a decision here, only the condition of its inclusion. So perhaps this step is more of a task than a decision point. 

The explicit decisions are the ones with conditions: eligibility check, pre-approval, and the high-value check.

But for the purpose of the summary, the decision points are:

1. **Triage Agent Decision**: The triage agent validates the claim's eligibility, making a go/no-go decision.
2. **Finance Controller's Decision**: The finance controller pre-approves the claim based on the checklist, which is a pre-approval decision.
3. **High-Value Branch**: The process automatically routes to Senior_Auditor_Review if the amount exceeds €1000, that is, a conditional decision based on the amount.
4. **Senior Auditor's Review Decision**: Required for high-value claims before payment, involves reviewing the AuditTrail and presumably making a pass/fail decision, though the process doesn't explicitly state this as a decision point. The original process does state that Senior_Auditor_Review must occur for high-value claims, implying that during this step, there's an additional layer of approval. Therefore, it's reasonable to include this as a decision point.

Finalizing:

**Decision Points:**
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: Validates if the claim is eligible based on FlightManifest and WeatherReport.
2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: Determines if the claim gets pre-approved using the EligibilityChecklist.
3. **High-Value Check**: Assesses if the refund amount exceeds €1000, triggering the Senior_Auditor_Review.
4. **Senior_Auditor_Review**: For high-value claims, verifies the AuditTrail and approves/rejects the claim.

**Required Documents:**
1. RefundRequestForm
2. FlightManifest
3. WeatherReport
4. EligibilityChecklist
5. BankTransferAuthorization (for payment)
6. AuditTrail (only if the claim is high-value)

But note that the user asks for all required documents. The BankTransferAuthorization is required for payment to proceed. The RefundConfirmationPDF is an output, not required as an input, so not included.

Final list:
- Documents across all process steps: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, BankTransferAuthorization, and AuditTrail (latter two only in specific circumstances).

But to list them properly:

**Required Documents:**
- RefundRequestForm: For initial claim submission.
- FlightManifest: For validation during triage.
- WeatherReport: For validation during triage.
- EligibilityChecklist: Used by the finance controller in pre-approval.
- BankTransferAuthorization: Required to process the refund payment.
- AuditTrail: Required for the Senior_Auditor_Review (if applicable).

The confirmation letter (PDF) is output, so not listed as required.

I think that's all. Now to format the user-facing answer with these points.
Here's a summary of all decision points and required documents in Contoso's flight-refund process:

➤ DECISION POINTS
1. **Triage Eligibility Check**
   The triage agent must decide if the claim is valid by verifying against the FlightManifest and WeatherReport.

2. **Finance Pre-Approval Decision**
   The finance controller must review the claim against the EligibilityChecklist to determine if pre-approval is granted.

3. **Refund Amount Evaluation**
   The system automatically determines if the refund amount exceeds €1,000, which triggers additional review requirements.

4. **Senior Auditor Validation** (for high-value claims only)
   For claims over €1,000, the senior auditor must review the AuditTrail to validate the claim before payment processing.

➤ REQUIRED DOCUMENTS
1. **RefundRequestForm**: Required for claim submission
2. **FlightManifest**: Used during initial validation
3. **WeatherReport**: Used during initial validation
4. **EligibilityChecklist**: Mandatory for finance approval
5. **BankTransferAuthorization**: Required for payment processing
6. **AuditTrail**: Exclusive to claims >€1,000 for senior review

Note: All documents are mandatory when applicable, with the AuditTrail specifically required only for high-value claims as determined by the amount threshold.
