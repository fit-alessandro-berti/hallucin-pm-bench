**No**, transition T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

**Justification:**  
T3 fires only when **both p3 and p4 have zero tokens** (due to the exclusion arc). T5 requires an inhibitor arc from p4, meaning p4 must be empty. However, T3 depends on p4 being non-empty, as p3 must be present (since p3 → p5). Thus, p4 is zero **only if** it hasn’t fired—so T5 cannot fire before T3, because T5 cannot initiate when p4 is non-zero (which is required for p3 to be populated). In fact, T3 fires *before* p4 becomes empty, as p3 fires first. T5 waits behind p4 becoming zero—this order is enforced by synchronization and arcs.

No valid firing sequence exists where T5 triggers before T3 in any reachable marking.
