**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** COO, Orion Insurance
**FROM:** Process Mining Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Urgent Review: Top 3 Waiting Time Bottlenecks

This memo outlines the three activities exhibiting the highest non-productive waiting periods, severely impacting cycle time.

| Rank | Activity | Avg. Waiting (h) | 95th Percentile (h) | Recommended Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Request Documents | 36.5 | 120.0 | Implement automated, staggered multi-channel reminders (email/SMS) for overdue items. |
| **2** | Send Closure Letter | 12.2 | 44.0 | Standardize and dedicate staff capacity specifically for final letter generation queue management. |
| **3** | Assess Liability | 7.8 | 16.4 | Implement a triage system to prioritize cases nearing regulatory review deadlines. |

Focusing immediate attention on these gaps is projected to cut overall lead time significantly.
