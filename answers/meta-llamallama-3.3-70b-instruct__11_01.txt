The three worst-performing activities by waiting-time are: 
1. Request_Documents (Avg: 36.5h, 95th percentile: 120.0h) 
2. Send_Closure_Letter (Avg: 12.2h, 95th percentile: 44.0h) 
3. Assess_Liability (Avg: 7.8h, 95th percentile: 16.4h)

To reduce waiting times by â‰¥ 20%, I recommend:
- Implementing automated document requests for Request_Documents
- Streamlining letter generation for Send_Closure_Letter
- Prioritizing Assess_Liability cases based on claim severity

These data-driven actions will improve efficiency and reduce waiting times.
