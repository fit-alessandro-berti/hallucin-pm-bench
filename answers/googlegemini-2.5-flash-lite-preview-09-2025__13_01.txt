Here are the answers based strictly on the provided event log fragment:

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” occur in this fragment?**
   1 time.

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**
   Total events = 18.
   Occurrences of "Manual\_Fraud\_Check" = 1.
   Percentage = $(1 / 18) \times 100 \approx 5.56\%$

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual\_Fraud\_Check”.**
   A1002

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**
    1. **Short Time Horizon:** The log fragment spans only a single day (2025-05-01). A single day is insufficient to extrapolate a reliable estimate for an entire month, as daily patterns (volume, staffing, time-of-day effects) may vary significantly throughout the month.
    2. **Small Sample Size/Incomplete Population:** Only 4 cases are observed, and only 1 of those performed the activity. This extremely small sample size (1/4 cases exhibiting the behavior) means the resulting frequency estimate cannot reliably represent the true population frequency over a longer period like a month, where new or different types of cases might appear.
