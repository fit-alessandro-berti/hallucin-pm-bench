Of course. Here is the summary as requested.

### Decision Points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate:** A decision to proceed is made if the two risk scores from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B** differ by ≤ 2 points. If they differ by more, the application is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision.
2.  **Amount Threshold Decision:** A decision is made based on the loan amount.
    *   If the amount is **< €15 000**, the system auto-approves.
    *   If the amount is **≥ €15 000**, the application is sent to the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** for a vote.
