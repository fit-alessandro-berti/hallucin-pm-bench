**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1 (PO > €10,000 approvals): satisfied.**  
   `PO_Amount = €12,300`, and approvals occur in the required order before `Issue_PO`:  
   - #2 `Approve_PO` by **Procurement_Officer**  
   - #3 `Approve_PO_CFO` by **CFO**  
   - #5 `Issue_PO` happens afterward.

2. **Rule 2 (Expedite_Flag condition): violated.**  
   `Expedite_Flag` is present at #4, so `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** first `Ship_Goods`.  
   - First `Ship_Goods`: #8  
   - `Risk_Assessment`: #9  
   This is the wrong order.

3. **Rule 3 (Three_way_match timing after Goods_Received): violated.**  
   After `Goods_Received` at #6, `Three_way_match` must occur within the next two activities (≤2).  
   - `Three_way_match` is at #10 (not within #7–#8), so timing exceeds the allowed distance.

4. **Rule 4 (Intern directly after CFO): satisfied.**  
   No activity by **Intern** directly follows a **CFO** activity.

5. **Rule 5 (must end with Archive_Record): satisfied.**  
   Last event is #11 `Archive_Record`, with nothing after it.

Because Rules **2** and **3** are breached, the trace is **non-compliant**.
