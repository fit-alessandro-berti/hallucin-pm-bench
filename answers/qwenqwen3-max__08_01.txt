**Answer: No — it is impossible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.**

### Short proof of impossibility:

To fire **T5**, two conditions must hold simultaneously in some marking **M**:

1. Place **p3 must contain at least one token** (normal input arc).
2. Place **p4 must contain zero tokens** (inhibitor arc condition).

Now, trace how tokens reach **p3** and **p4**:

- The only way to put a token into **p3** is by firing **T2**, which requires a token in **p1**.
- The only way to put a token into **p1** is by firing **T1**, which also puts a token into **p2** (parallel split).
- The only way to put a token into **p4** is by firing **T3**, which consumes the token from **p2**.

Thus, **after T1 fires**, we have tokens in both **p1** and **p2**.

- To enable **T2** (and hence eventually produce a token in **p3**), we must fire **T2**, which only needs **p1**. So we *can* fire **T2** before **T3**, yielding a token in **p3**, while **p2** still holds its token.
- However, **p4** remains empty **until T3 fires**. So in the marking after **T1; T2**, we have:  
  **p3 = 1**, **p2 = 1**, **p4 = 0**.

At first glance, this seems to satisfy T5’s preconditions (**p3 ≥ 1**, **p4 = 0**). **But wait**: can we fire **T5** at this point?

Yes — **except** we must check whether **T3 has fired**. In this scenario, **T3 has not fired yet**, so it appears T5 *could* fire before T3.

However, recall: **T5 requires p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0**, and that *is* satisfied after **T1; T2**.

So is the above reasoning flawed?

Let’s construct the sequence:

- Initial: **M₀ = [p0:1, others:0]**
- Fire **T1**: consumes p0, produces p1 and p2 → **M₁ = [p1:1, p2:1]**
- Fire **T2**: consumes p1, produces p3 → **M₂ = [p2:1, p3:1]**

Now:
- **p3 = 1** ✔️
- **p4 = 0** ✔️ (since T3 hasn’t fired)
- So **T5 is enabled** in **M₂**, and **T3 has not yet fired**.

Thus, **T5 can fire before T3**!

But wait — this contradicts our initial claim.

Let’s double-check the transition definitions:

> T5 : p3 –|p4 → p6  
> ("–|p4" = inhibitor arc from p4)

Yes — so T5 only requires **p3 ≥ 1** and **p4 = 0**. No requirement on p2.

In **M₂**, p2 = 1, p3 = 1, p4 = 0 → T5 is enabled.

So **T5 can fire** in **M₂**, producing p6, yielding:

- **M₃ = [p2:1, p6:1]**

And **T3 has not fired** at any point.

Therefore, **YES**, T5 **can** fire before T3.

But hold on — is there any implicit assumption that the process must terminate or that all branches must be completed? The question asks only about **reachability** and **possibility of firing T5 before T3**, not about completing the process.

So the correct answer is actually:

---

**Answer: Yes.**

### Concrete firing sequence:

1. **T1** fires:  
   - Consumes token from **p0**  
   - Produces tokens in **p1** and **p2**  
   - Marking: **p1=1, p2=1**

2. **T2** fires:  
   - Consumes token from **p1**  
   - Produces token in **p3**  
   - Marking: **p2=1, p3=1**

3. **T5** fires:  
   - Requires **p3 ≥ 1** and **p4 = 0** → both true  
   - Consumes token from **p3**, produces token in **p6**  
   - Marking: **p2=1, p6=1**

At this point, **T5 has fired**, and **T3 has never fired**.

Thus, **T5 fires before T3** is possible.

> ✅ **Conclusion: Yes, it is possible.**  
> **Firing sequence: T1 → T2 → T5**  
> **Justification**: After T1 and T2, p3=1 and p4=0, enabling T5, while T3 remains unfired.
