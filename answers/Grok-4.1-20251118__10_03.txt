**Legend for the full RACI:**

- **R** = Responsible (performs the activity)
- **A** = Accountable (ultimately answerable; has final approval authority where required)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input if needed; not shown as no consultation is explicitly required in the process)
- **I** = Informed (kept up-to-date; here only Treasury Ops informs the Front-Office Analyst after release)
- **-** = Not involved

Note: For cases with Risk Scoring ≤70, Treasury Ops proceeds directly without Compliance Officer involvement; for cases >70, escalation to Compliance Officer for approval is mandatory before Treasury Ops can act.
