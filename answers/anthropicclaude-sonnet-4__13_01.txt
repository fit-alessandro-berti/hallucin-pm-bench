Looking at the event log fragment, I'll analyze each question:

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occur in this fragment?**
   
   Examining each log line, "Manual_Fraud_Check" appears exactly **1 time** (in case A1002 at 2025-05-01T10:50:00).

2. **What percentage of all logged events does this represent?**
   
   There are 18 total logged events in the fragment.
   Percentage = (1 รท 18) ร 100 = **5.56%**

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check".**
   
   **A1002** is the only case that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check".

4. **Two sampling-related reasons why the monthly frequency estimate would be unreliable:**
   
   1. **Temporal coverage bias**: This fragment covers only a few hours on a single day (May 1st, 9:00 AM to 2:05 PM), which cannot represent the variability in fraud check patterns across different times of day, days of the week, or throughout an entire month.
   
   2. **Sample size inadequacy**: With only 4 cases and 18 events total, this is an extremely small sample that lacks statistical power to reliably estimate monthly frequencies, especially for what appears to be a relatively rare event like manual fraud checks.
