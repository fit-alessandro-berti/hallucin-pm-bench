### Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process
These are the explicit gates where progression depends on specific outcomes:

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   - If Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B risk scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC).  
   - Else, escalate to **Harmonisation Committee** for tie-break, then continue.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   - If amount **< €15 000**, system auto-approves and proceeds to Disburse Funds.  
   - If amount **≥ €15 000**, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
