1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.

2. There are a total of 18 logged events. The percentage of events that are **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** is calculated as follows:

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable are:
   - **Small Sample Size**: The log fragment only contains 18 events, which is a very small sample to make any reliable estimates about monthly frequencies.
   - **Lack of Temporal Representation**: The log fragment represents only a single day, and may not reflect the typical pattern or frequency of manual fraud checks over an entire month.
