Looking at the event log fragment, I'll analyze each question systematically.

**Q1: Distinct case IDs**
- A-9321
- B-1045
- C-77
Total: 3

**Q2: Activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" in case A-9321**
Events for A-9321 in chronological order:
1. 2025-04-14T08:02:00 - Receive_Order
2. 2025-04-14T08:16:00 - Validate_Order
3. 2025-04-14T09:01:00 - Pack_Items
4. 2025-04-14T09:20:00 - Ship_Order

The activity immediately before Ship_Order is: Pack_Items

**Q3: Earliest timestamp**
Scanning all timestamps:
- 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00 (A-9321, Receive_Order) ‚Üê earliest
- 2025-04-14T08:05:00.000+00:00 (B-1045, Receive_Order)
- Others are later

**Q4: Occurrences of "Quality_Check"**
- 2025-04-14T08:45:00 (B-1045)
- 2025-04-14T10:00:00 (C-77)
Total: 2

**Q5: Activities never appearing as first event of any case**
First events per case:
- A-9321: Receive_Order (08:02:00)
- B-1045: Receive_Order (08:05:00)
- C-77: Quality_Check (10:00:00) - only event for this case

All activities in the log: Receive_Order, Validate_Order, Pack_Items, Quality_Check, Ship_Order

Activities that never appear first:
- Validate_Order
- Pack_Items
- Ship_Order
