**Answer:** No

**Justification:**

The statement "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between" is **not accurate** based on the event-log excerpt. Here are the relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences that contradict the claim:

- **Case C001:**
  - Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` → `Pack_Items`  
  - ✅ `Validate_Payment` **does** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` (no activity in between).

- **Case C002:**
  - Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment`  
  - ❌ `Validate_Payment` **does not** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` — `Pack_Items` occurs in between.

- **Case C003:**
  - Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` → `Ship_Order`  
  - ✅ `Validate_Payment` **does** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` (no activity in between).

- **Case C004:**
  - Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment` → `Pack_Items`  
  - ❌ `Validate_Payment` **does not** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` — `Check_Fraud` occurs in between.

**Conclusion:**  
Since **Cases C002 and C004** show that `Validate_Payment` is **not** always immediately after `Receive_Order`, the stated FACT is **incorrect**.
