- **Task_VerifyIdentity:** A new task added at the start of the process to verify the identity of the applicant.
- **Task_RequestDocs:** A new task added to handle cases where additional documents are required.
- **Task_FinalReject:** A new task to handle final rejection decisions in the process.

### Removed tasks
- **Task_RejectLoan:** This task was removed and appears to have been replaced by "Task_FinalReject".

### Gateway-type changes
