Executive memo: Based on joint consideration of SLA breaches and Avg_Waiting_Time, the three worst-performing activities are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval exceeds its Target_SLA by 300 s (Avg_Throughput_Time 900 s vs Target_SLA 600 s) and has Avg_Waiting_Time 600 s for 465 cases. Risk Review exceeds its Target_SLA by 300 s (Avg_Throughput_Time 600 s vs Target_SLA 300 s) and has Avg_Waiting_Time 480 s for 480 cases. Credit Assessment exceeds its Target_SLA by 60 s (Avg_Throughput_Time 300 s vs Target_SLA 240 s) and has Avg_Waiting_Time 200 s for 1,175 cases.

Recommendations:
- Legal Approval: Reduce Avg_Throughput_Time by 300 s (from 900 s to 600 s) to eliminate the SLA breach affecting 465 cases.
- Risk Review: Reduce Avg_Throughput_Time by 300 s (from 600 s to 300 s) to eliminate the SLA breach affecting 480 cases.
- Credit Assessment: Reduce Avg_Throughput_Time by 60 s (from 300 s to 240 s) to eliminate the SLA breach affecting 1,175 cases.
