Let's analyze the situation:

**Question 1:**
No, in any reachable marking, T5 cannot fire before T3.

Here's the reasoning:
- T5 requires both P2 and P5 to be present.
- T3 requires only P2 to be present.
- M0 only has P2 in the places.
- T5 cannot fire before T3 because it needs an additional token (P5) that isn't available in M0.

**Question 2:**
No, there is no minimal firing sequence where T5 fires before T3.

Explanation:
Given the place transitions and initial marking, transitions cannot occur out of order. The consistent order must be T3 â†’ T5.

[Additional reasoning compressed within the 120-word limit]
T3's single-place release (P2) must happen first, then T5's multi-place release can occur afterwards, because all tokens for T5 must be available at that point, which only becomes possible after the release of P2. There's no way to rearrange the sequence without violating the Petri net rules.
