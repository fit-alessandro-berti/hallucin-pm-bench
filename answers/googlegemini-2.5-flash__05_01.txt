To enforce the SLA, we will add an **Interrupting Timer Boundary Event** to the `Task_Receive` (ID: `Task_Receive`) activity. This event will trigger if the process is stuck in or after this initial receipt phase for too long.

1.  **Add `Timer_48h_Escalation` as an interrupting boundary event on `Task_Receive`**.
2.  **Configure its timer definition to 48 hours (`PT48H`)**.
3.  **Add a new sequence flow `f_escalate` from `Timer_48h_Escalation` to `End_Done`**.

This improvement ensures that if the claim is not processed past the initial `Task_Receive` within 48 hours of *starting* that task (which is effectively soon after submission), the process is immediately escalated (terminated via `End_Done`). This models auto-escalation by interrupting the normal flow for overdue claims.
