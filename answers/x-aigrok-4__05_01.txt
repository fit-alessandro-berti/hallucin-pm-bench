Attach an interrupting boundary timer event to Task_RequestDocs with time duration PT48H (id: Timer_Escalate). Add a sequence flow from Timer_Escalate to Task_Triage. This ensures that if Task_RequestDocs exceeds 48 hours (e.g., waiting for docs), the process auto-escalates by interrupting and proceeding to triage, meeting the SLA.
