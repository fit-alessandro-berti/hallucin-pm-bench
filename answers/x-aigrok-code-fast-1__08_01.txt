Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3 in the reachable marking after firing T1 and T2.

Firing sequence from initial marking: T1, T2, T5.

- After T1: p1(1), p2(1)  
- After T2: p1(0), p3(1), p2(1)  
- When T5 fires: p3 has a token and p4 has zero (inhibitor satisfied), so T5 moves one token from p3 to p6. T3 has not fired (p2 still has a token, enabling it).  

After this sequence, the marking is p2(1), p6(1); T3 could still fire afterward, but T5 has fired before it. No other sequences prevent T5 from firing before T3 if desired.
