No.

The claim is incorrect because there is an instance where *Validate_Payment* does not follow *Receive_Order*. In lines 6 and 7 for case C003, *Validate_Payment* (line 6) occurs *before* *Receive_Order* (line 7). The log shows variability in the sequence, disproving the “always follows” assertion. Other cases (C001, C002, C004) do follow the expected sequence, but C003 violates it, making the statement false.
