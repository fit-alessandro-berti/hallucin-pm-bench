To answer whether transition \( T5 \) can fire **before** transition \( T3 \) in any reachable marking of the Petri net, we analyze the **enabling conditions** of \( T5 \) and \( T3 \), and determine if a valid firing sequence exists where \( T5 \) is enabled before \( T3 \).


### **Key Definitions**
First, clarify the enabling conditions for \( T5 \) and \( T3 \):
- **\( T5 \)**: Has two input arcs:  
  - A **normal arc** from \( p3 \) (requires \( p3 \) to have a token).  
  - An **inhibitor arc** from \( p4 \) (requires \( p4 \) to have **zero** tokens to fire).  
  Thus, \( T5 \) can only fire if \( p3 \) has a token **and** \( p4 \) is empty.  
- **\( T3 \)**: Has a single normal arc from \( p2 \) (requires \( p2 \) to have a token to fire).  


### **Reachable Markings & Firing Sequence**
The initial marking is \( p0=1 \) (initial token) and all other places (\( p1-p6 \)) empty. The only transition that can fire initially is \( T1 \) (parallel split from \( p0 \)).  

#### Step 1: Fire \( T1 \)  
\( T1 \) consumes \( p0 \) (now \( 0 \)) and produces tokens in \( p1 \) and \( p2 \) (now \( 1 \) each).  
**Marking**: \( p0=0 \), \( p1=1 \), \( p2=1 \), \( p3=0 \), \( p4=0 \), \( p5=0 \), \( p6=0 \).  

#### Step 2: Fire \( T2 \)  
\( T2 \) is enabled because \( p1=1 \). It consumes \( p1 \) (now \( 0 \)) and produces a token in \( p3 \) (now \( 1 \)).  
**Marking**: \( p0=0 \), \( p1=0 \), \( p2=1 \), \( p3=1 \), \( p4=0 \), \( p5=0 \), \( p6=0 \).  

#### Step 3: Fire \( T5 \)  
At this marking, \( T5 \) is **enabled** because:  
- \( p3=1 \) (normal arc from \( p3 \) is satisfied).  
- \( p4=0 \) (inhibitor arc condition from \( p4 \) is satisfied).  
\( T5 \) consumes \( p3 \) (now \( 0 \)) and produces a token in \( p6 \) (now \( 1 \)).  
**Marking**: \( p0=0 \), \( p1=0 \), \( p2=1 \), \( p3=0 \), \( p4=0 \), \( p5=0 \), \( p6=1 \).  


### **Why \( T5 \) Can Fire Before \( T3 \)**
In the marking after Step 2, \( T5 \) is enabled (due to \( p3=1 \) and \( p4=0 \)) while \( T3 \) is also enabled (\( p2=1 \)). The analyst can choose to fire \( T5 \) first (since it is enabled) before firing \( T3 \). This sequence is valid because:  
- \( T1 \) is required to produce tokens for \( p1 \) and \( p2 \).  
- \( T2 \) is required to produce a token for \( p3 \) (enabling \( T5 \)).  
- \( T5 \) is enabled by the combined conditions of \( p3=1 \) and \( p4=0 \), and can fire before \( T3 \).  


### **Conclusion**
Yes, it is possible for \( T5 \) to fire before \( T3 \). A concrete firing sequence is provided above, where \( T5 \) is enabled by the time \( T3 \) is ready to fire, and the order of firing is valid per Petri net semantics.


**Concrete Firing Sequence**:  
1. Fire \( T1 \) (from initial marking).  
2. Fire \( T2 \) (enabled by \( p1=1 \)).  
3. Fire \( T5 \) (enabled by \( p3=1 \) and \( p4=0 \)).  

**Justification**: \( T5 \) is enabled by the combined conditions of \( p3 \) having a token (from \( T2 \)) and \( p4 \) being empty (inhibitor arc condition). \( T3 \) is enabled but has not fired yet, allowing \( T5 \) to fire first.
