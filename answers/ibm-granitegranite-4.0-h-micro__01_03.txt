**a) Decision Points in Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS Loan-Approval Process**

1. **Risk Rating Evaluation** – After receiving the application (Form 14B), the Deck Officer conducts a Tri-Color-Risk-Check using Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow. If the resulting risk rating is Low or Medium **and** the requested amount is €250,000 or less, the process skips the manual underwriting review and proceeds directly to the decision gate.

2. **Manual Underwriting Review** – If the risk rating is High **or** the requested amount exceeds €250,000, the application moves to a Manual-Underwriting-Review stage, where a Deck Memo is prepared for further evaluation.

3. **TriVote Decision Gate** – Regardless of the outcome of the risk check and amount criteria, the application reaches a TriVote decision gate. This gate requires approvals from three distinct roles: the Credit Lead, the Regulatory Liaison, and the Sustainability Officer. A decision to approve is made if **any two** of these three approvers give their approval.

**b) Documents Required Throughout the Process (in Order of First Appearance)**

1. **Form 14B** – The initial loan application submitted by the borrower.  
2. **Deck Memo** – Prepared during the Manual-Underwriting-Review step if the risk rating is High or the requested amount exceeds €250,000.  
3. **Offer Sheet 77** – Prepared after the TriVote decision gate, this document outlines the terms of the loan offer.  
4. **ID Matrix Declaration** – Required alongside the Offer Sheet 77 for applicant verification.  
5. **Loan Dossier 2025** – The final agreement document prepared after all approvals are secured and the applicant confirms the terms.  

These documents represent the complete sequence of actions and required paperwork from the initial application through to final loan agreement in Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process.
