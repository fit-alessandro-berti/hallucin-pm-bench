1) The **average cycle time (hours)** for **“Review Contract”** **cannot be derived** from the data provided.

2) **Why:** Cycle time requires **start and end timestamps** (or a precomputed **duration/elapsed time** per event). In the excerpted log, those fields are explicitly **redacted**, and only **case_id, activity, resource** are available. With no per-event durations (and no timestamps to compute them), there’s no way to calculate an average cycle time for “Review Contract,” even though we can see it occurs in cases C-001, C-002, C-003, and C-004.
