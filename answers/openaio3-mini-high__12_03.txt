Answer: No.

Justification:
• In Case C001, the sequence is: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items.
• However, in Case C002 the events occur in this order: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment.
• Additionally, in Case C004 the order is: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items.

These cases show that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order" since other activities come in between in some cases.
