## Decision points in Contoso’s refund process (and the documents they use)

1. **Eligibility decision (during _Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility_)**  
   - **Decision being made:** Is the submitted claim eligible when checked against operational records?  
   - **Documents required/used:**  
     - *RefundRequestForm* (the customer’s submission)  
     - *FlightManifest* (to verify passenger/flight details)  
     - *WeatherReport* (to validate relevant disruption conditions)

2. **Pre-approval decision (during _Finance_Controller_PreApprove_)**  
   - **Decision being made:** Does the finance controller sign off that the claim meets the pre-approval criteria?  
   - **Documents required/used:**  
     - *EligibilityChecklist* (used for controller sign-off)

3. **High-value branch decision (gateway after amount is known)**  
   - **Decision being made:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1,000**?  
   - **If NO (≤ €1,000):** proceed toward payment once pre-approval and payment authorization requirements are met.  
   - **If YES (> €1,000):** **_Senior_Auditor_Review_ is mandatory** before payment can begin.  
   - **Documents required/used (only for this high-value branch):**  
     - *AuditTrail* (must be included in the senior audit review)

4. **Payment start authorization decision (before/during _Process_Refund_Payment_)**  
   - **Decision being made:** Are all prerequisites satisfied so payment may begin?  
   - **Required conditions (per constraints):**  
     - _Finance_Controller_PreApprove_ has **succeeded**, **and**  
     - if high-value (> €1,000), _Senior_Auditor_Review_ has been **completed**, **and**  
     - a signed *BankTransferAuthorization* is present  
   - **Document required/used:**  
     - *BankTransferAuthorization* (must be signed/present to execute payment)
