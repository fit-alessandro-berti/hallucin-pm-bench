While cases C001 (lines 1–2), C002 (lines 3–5) and C004 (lines 8–9) show Validate_Payment occurring after a preceding Receive_Order, case C003 has Validate_Payment in line 6 followed only later by Receive_Order in line 7, and case C005 contains Validate_Payment in line 11 with no Receive_Order at all. These counter-examples demonstrate that Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order in the log fragment.
