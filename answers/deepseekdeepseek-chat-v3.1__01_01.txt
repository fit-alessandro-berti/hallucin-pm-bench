Of course. Based on the defined Contoso Airlines flight-refund process, here is a summary of the decision points and required documents.

### Decisions and Required Documents in Contoso’s Process

There are **two explicit decision points** and a conditional branching point in the process.

**1. Decision: Claim Eligibility**
*   **Activity:** `Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility`
*   **Description:** A triage agent decides whether the submitted claim meets the initial eligibility criteria.
*   **Required Documents:**
    *   `RefundRequestForm` (submitted by the customer)
    *   `FlightManifest` (for verification)
    *   `WeatherReport` (for verification)

**2. Decision: Financial Pre-Approval**
*   **Activity:** `Finance_Controller_PreApprove`
*   **Description:** A finance controller makes the decision to pre-approve the refund based on financial criteria.
*   **Required Documents:**
    *   `EligibilityChecklist` (confirmed by the triage agent)

---

**Conditional Branching Point (Not a manual decision):**

*   **Rule:** If the refund amount is **greater than €1,000**, the process automatically branches to a mandatory `Senior_Auditor_Review`.
*   **Activity:** `Senior_Auditor_Review` (this is a required step for high-value claims, not a decision gate)
*   **Required Document:**
    *   `AuditTrail`

**Final Processing Documents:**
*   **Activity:** `Process_Refund_Payment`
*   **Required Document:**
    *   `BankTransferAuthorization` (must be signed)
*   **Activity:** `Issue_Confirmation_Letter`
*   **Generated Document:**
    *   `RefundConfirmationPDF`
