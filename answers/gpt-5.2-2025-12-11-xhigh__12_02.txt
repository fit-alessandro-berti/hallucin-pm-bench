No

In case **C003**, **Validate_Payment** occurs **before** **Receive_Order** (line **6** vs. line **7**), contradicting “always follows”; additionally, case **C005** shows **Validate_Payment** at line **11** with **no Receive_Order** event present for that case in the fragment, so it cannot be said to follow it.
