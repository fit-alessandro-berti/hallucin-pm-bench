# Compliance Audit Report: Case #47291

## Rule-by-Rule Analysis

**R1: Compliant**
PO amount (€12,450) exceeds €10,000 threshold. Manager_Approval (2025-03-03) correctly preceded Finance_Approval (2025-03-04).

**R2: Compliant**
Expedited = true. Finance_Approval (2025-03-04) was last required approval. Ship_Goods occurred 2025-03-05, within 2 calendar days.

**R3: Violated**
Pay_Invoice occurred on 2025-03-06 at 09:00, before Receive_Goods on 2025-03-07 at 14:13, violating the required sequence.

**R4: Not Applicable**
hazardous = false, so Safety_Inspection is not required by this rule.

**R5: Violated**
Change_Request occurred 2025-03-04 after approvals. New Manager_Approval (2025-03-07) was obtained, but Ship_Goods (2025-03-05), Receive_Goods (2025-03-07), and Pay_Invoice (2025-03-06) all occurred before the new approval, violating the requirement.

**R6: Compliant**
Archive_Record occurred as the final event (2025-03-07 16:20), properly terminating the case.

## Overall Result: NON-COMPLIANT
