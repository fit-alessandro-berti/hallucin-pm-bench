2.  
   a) Percentage of all events:  
      Total events = 48.  
      Events with "Manual_Fraud_Check" = 1.  
      Percentage = (1 / 48) * 100 = **2.08%**.  

   b) Percentage of all unique cases:

3. With only 1 occurrence across 12 cases, "Manual_Fraud_Check" represents an extremely infrequent path. Generalizing process models or performance metrics (e.g., average cycle time) from this data slice would ignore this rare variant, leading to inaccurate models that misrepresent the true process flexibility. Predictive analyses might fail to account for the manual check's impact, as its low frequency prevents reliable pattern identification.
