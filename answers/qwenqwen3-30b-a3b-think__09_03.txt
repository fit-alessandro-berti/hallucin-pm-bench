The average cycle time of the activity "Approve Invoice" cannot be computed from the provided artefacts. Artefact A contains only header information and no actual timestamp or duration data, as all row values (including start_time and complete_time) are redacted for privacy. Artefact B provides SLA-related metrics (e.g., 7.8-day average from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice") but does not include direct cycle time data for "Approve Invoice" itself. Without specific timestamps or durations for this activity, exact computation is impossible.
