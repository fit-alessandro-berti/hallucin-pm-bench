I'm sorry, but I cannot compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Approve Invoice,” the standard deviation, or the 95% confidence interval based on the provided information. The event log stub (Artefact A) has all rows and timestamp values redacted for privacy, leaving only the column headers. Without the actual start_time and complete_time data for each event, it is impossible to calculate the duration of any activity, including “Approve Invoice.” Additionally, while Artefact B provides SLA and historical KPI data, it does not include specific cycle time information for individual activities like “Approve Invoice” or any data points from the current log to perform statistical calculations. Therefore, no metrics can be computed with the given artefacts.
