**Answer 1:** No.

**Answer 2:** Not applicable.

Explanation: T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. P5 is only marked by T4, which consumes a token from P4. P4 can be marked either by T7 (from P3) or T3 (from P2), but T3 is the only way that directly uses P2’s token. However, T2 → T7 must fire to enable P4 via P3, but that path does not produce P5. Only after T4 fires (requiring P4) can P5 be filled. Since T3 must mark P4 before T4 can fire, T3 must occur before T5 can ever be enabled. Hence, T5 cannot fire before T3 is fired.
