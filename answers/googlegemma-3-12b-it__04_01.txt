Non-compliant.

1. **Rule 1 violation:** The PO amount is €12,300, exceeding the €10,000 threshold. Therefore, it *must* receive two approvals: a Procurement Officer and the CFO *before* `Issue_PO`. The trace shows `Approve_PO` (Procurement Officer) and `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO) *before* `Issue_PO`, satisfying this requirement.
2. **Rule 2 violation:** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag`. This makes `Quality_Check` optional, and `Risk_Assessment` *must* occur before `Ship_Goods`. The trace shows `Risk_Assessment` occurring after `Ship_Goods` (steps 9 and 8), violating this requirement.
3. **Rule 3 violation:** After `Goods_Received`, `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities. `Goods_Received` is at step 6, and `Three_way_match` is at step 10 - this satisfies the distance requirement.
4. **Rule 4 violation:** The CFO executed `Approve_PO_CFO` at step 3. The next activity, `Expedite_Flag` at step 4, was executed by the System. However, step 5's `Issue_PO` *directly* follows `Expedite_Flag`, and is a system activity, so there's no rule 4 violation. But directly following that is `Goods_Received` which is executed by `Warehouse_Clerk`. Step 7 `Move_to_Quality` is executed by the `Intern`; thus the rule is violated as an Intern activity follows an activity executed by `Warehouse_Clerk`.
5. **Rule 5 compliance:** The trace ends with `Archive_Record`, satisfying this requirement.



Because of these violations, the trace is non-compliant.
