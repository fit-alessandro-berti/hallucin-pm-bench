Answer: Yes. One can produce PD (without first producing PC) and PE in parallel, so that PD and PE are both marked and T5 fires before T3 ever becomes enabled. A shortest witness is the four‐step sequence:

1. T1  (consumes p0, produces pa and pb)
2. T2b (consumes pa, produces pd)
3. T4  (consumes pb, produces pe)
4. T5  (consumes pd and pe, produces pf)

After step 3, both pd and pe are marked, hence T5 is enabled and can fire at that time—before any marking of pc has occurred, which would be needed for T3.
