**No**

The fact is not accurate. Here's the justification based on the event-log excerpt:

1. **C001**: Follows the pattern - Receive_Order (09:12) → Validate_Payment (09:15) ✓

2. **C002**: Does NOT follow the pattern - Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05)
   - Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment

3. **C003**: Follows the pattern - Receive_Order (09:40) → Validate_Payment (09:44) ✓

4. **C004**: Does NOT follow the pattern - Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20)
   - Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment

In 2 out of 4 cases (C002 and C004), there are other activities between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment", directly contradicting the claim that Validate_Payment "always occurs immediately after" Receive_Order.
