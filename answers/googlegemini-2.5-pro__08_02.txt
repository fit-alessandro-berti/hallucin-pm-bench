**Question 1:**
Yes, in a reachable marking, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

**Question 2:**
A minimal firing sequence is **<T1, T2, T7, T4, T5>**.

Firing **T1** creates two parallel branches with tokens in P1 and P2. The branch starting with P1 can progress independently by firing **T2**, then **T7**, then **T4**. Firing **T4** places a token in P5.

The marking is now { P2, P5 }. This satisfies the preconditions for the synchronising join **T5**, allowing it to fire. This entire sequence completes without requiring **T3** to fire, as the alternate path through T7 was used to produce the token needed for T4.
