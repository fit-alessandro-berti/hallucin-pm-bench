1. **Manual_Fraud_Check** Activity Count:  

The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **once** in the excerpt (C05).

2. Percentage Calculations:  
   a) Percentage of all events (48 total):  

   **(1 / 48) * 100 = 2.08%**  

   b) Percentage of all unique cases (12 total):  

   **(1 / 12) * 100 = 8.33%**  

3. **Rationale for caution**:  

While **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** has a low support of 8.33% across cases and 2.08% of events, even minor activities can disproportionately affect process metrics (e.g., cycle time). In small samples, this activity could distort average processing times and fraud patterns. If scaled, it may inaccurately suggest frequent manual intervention or fraud concerns, leading to misinterpretation and misguided optimisation efforts. Careful sampling, large datasets, and sensitivity analyses are required to ensure such events do not skew overall assessments.
