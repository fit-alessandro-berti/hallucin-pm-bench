Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 requires **Risk_Assessment to occur before Ship_Goods**; in the trace, `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) is **after** `Ship_Goods` (event 8).

2. Rule 3 mandates that `Three_way_match` appears within the next two activities after `Goods_Received`.  
   `Goods_Received` is event 6; possible positions for `Three_way_match` would be events 7 or 8.  
   However, event 7 = `Move_to_Quality` and event 8 = `Ship_Goods`, so `Three_way_match` (event 10) violates the distance requirement.

(There is no violation of rule 1: the â‚¬12 300 PO was indeed approved first by Procurement_Officer and then by CFO in the correct order, and rule 5 is also satisfied since Archive_Record is the final event.)
