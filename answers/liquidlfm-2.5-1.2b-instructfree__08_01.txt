Let's analyze whether T5 can fire before T3.

From the net:
- T3 fires when **p2** fires.  
- T4 fires when p2 is present.  
- T5 fires when p4 is empty **and** there is an inhibitor arc from p3 to p4.

The initiating (initial) marking has p2 = 0.  
T3 needs p2 to fire (but p2=0), so T3 cannot fire.  
Hence, **T5 cannot fire before T3**.  

Thus, the answer is **no**: it is not possible for T5 to fire before T3 under any reachable marking.

Answer: No, T5 cannot fire before T3 because T3 requires p2 to initially fire.
