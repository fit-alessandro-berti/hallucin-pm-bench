Yes, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

### Shortest firing sequence:
**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

---

### Step-by-step justification:

**Initial marking:**  
p0 = 1, all others = 0

---

**Step 1: Fire T1**  
- Input: p0 (1) → consumed  
- Output: pa (1), pb (1)  
→ **Marking:** p0=0, pa=1, pb=1, others=0  

**Step 2: Fire T2b** (shortcut from pa → pd)  
- Input: pa (1) → consumed  
- Output: pd (1)  
→ **Marking:** pa=0, pb=1, pd=1, others=0  

**Step 3: Fire T4**  
- Input: pb (1) → consumed  
- Output: pe (1)  
→ **Marking:** pb=0, pd=1, pe=1, others=0  

**Step 4: Fire T5**  
- Input: pd (1) and pe (1) → both consumed  
- Output: pf (1)  
→ **Marking:** pd=0, pe=0, pf=1  

At this point, **T5 has fired**, and **T3 has never fired**.

Note:  
- T3 requires **pc** as input.  
- pc was **never marked** in this sequence.  
- T2 (which would produce pc) was **not fired** — instead, T2b was fired, bypassing pc entirely.  
- Thus, T3 is **not required** for T5 to fire, and in this sequence, T5 fires **before** T3 even has a chance to be enabled.

---

### Conclusion:
**Yes**, T5 can fire before T3.  
**Shortest firing sequence:** **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

This sequence is valid under the given net and initial marking, and T3 remains unenabled throughout.
