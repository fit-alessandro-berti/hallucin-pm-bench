**Subject:** Urgent Process Improvements to Reduce SLA Breaches and Waiting Times

Dear COO,

Analysis of the latest process data reveals three activities where high waiting times and SLA breaches are most severe, impacting operational efficiency and customer experience:

- **Legal Approval** exceeds its 600s SLA by **300s** (50%) and has the highest average waiting time (600s), delaying downstream steps.
- **Risk Review** breaches its 300s SLA by **300s** (100%) and has the second-highest waiting time (480s), creating bottlenecks.
- **Credit Assessment** exceeds its 240s SLA by **60s** (25%) with a waiting time of 200s, straining capacity.

**Recommendations:**
- **Legal Approval:** Implement a tiered approval matrix, routing low-risk cases (e.g., <$50K) to junior counsel, reducing wait times by an estimated **40%** based on historical case complexity data.
- **Risk Review:** Introduce automated pre-screening for standard risk profiles (e.g., FICO >700), which could eliminate **30%** of manual reviews, per pilot results.
- **Credit Assessment:** Deploy a dedicated "fast-track" team for applications with complete documentation (≈40% of cases), cutting waiting time by **50%** as demonstrated in prior tests.

These actions leverage existing data to address root causes without requiring new resources. Let’s discuss prioritization in our next review.
