Here's the breakdown of Acme Bank's small-business loan approval process:

**a)** Decision Points:

*   **Tri-Color-Risk-Check:** This step determines the risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) based on the three scorecards.
*   **Conditional Branch:** If the risk is rated Low or Medium AND the requested loan amount is less than or equal to €250,000, the process skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review.
*   **TriVote (Decision Gate):** The loan is approved if at least two out of three approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) give their approval.

**b)** Required Documents (in order of appearance):

1.  **Form 14B**
