**Decision Points in Contoso’s Refund Process**  
1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision**: Whether the passenger’s claim is eligible for a refund.  
   - **Documents**: FlightManifest (to verify passenger/flight details) and WeatherReport (to confirm flight disruption eligibility).  

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   - **Decision**: Whether the refund meets preapproval criteria.  
   - **Document**: EligibilityChecklist (used to validate compliance with financial policies).  

3. **Senior_Auditor_Review** (high-value branch only)  
   - **Decision**: Whether the refund exceeding €1,000 is justified and compliant.  
   - **Document**: AuditTrail (to verify process adherence and traceability).  

**All Required Documents**  
- RefundRequestForm (submitted by the passenger).  
- FlightManifest (for eligibility validation).  
- WeatherReport (for disruption validation).  
- EligibilityChecklist (for financial preapproval).  
- AuditTrail (mandatory for high-value refunds).  
- BankTransferAuthorization (to execute payment).  

**Note**: The legacy activity “CustomerService_Agent_Decide” is explicitly excluded from Contoso’s process.
