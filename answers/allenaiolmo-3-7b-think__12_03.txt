No  
**Justification:**  
The FACT is **not accurate** because there are cases where "Validate_Payment" does **not** immediately follow "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between.  

- **Case C002**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order (09:30) → Pack_Items (09:50) → Validate_Payment (10:05)`  
  The "Pack_Items" activity occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," violating the claim of immediate succession.  

- **Case C004**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order (10:05) → Check_Fraud (10:07) → Validate_Payment (10:20)`  
  The "Check_Fraud" activity intervenes between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," again contradicting the FACT.  

While **C001** and **C003** follow the sequence without intermediate activities, the presence of counterexamples (C002 and C004) invalidates the general rule stated in the FACT.
