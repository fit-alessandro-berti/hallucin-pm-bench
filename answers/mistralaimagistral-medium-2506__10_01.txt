Here’s the RACI matrix for FinCo’s order-to-cash workflow, adhering strictly to the preferred terminology:

| Activity          | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application | **R/A**             | I                       | I                  | I               |
| **KYC Review**     | I                    | **R/A**                | I                  | I               |
| **Order Vetting**  | **R/A**             | C                       | I                  | I               |
| **Payment Clearance** | I                | C                       | **R/A**           | I               |
| Record Update      | C                    | I                       | C                  | **R/A**         |
| Notify Customer    | **R/A**             | I                       | I                  | I               |

**Key:**
- **R/A** = Responsible/Accountable
- **C** = Consulted
- **I** = Informed

**Notes:**
1. The **KYC Review**, **Order Vetting**, and **Payment Clearance** use the required terminology.
2. The **Compliance Officer (CO)** has accountability (A) for **KYC Review** (aligning with their role in verifying due diligence).
3. The **Finance Clerk (FC)** owns **Payment Clearance** (initiating settlement).
4. IT Support (IT) is responsible for updating records in the CRM.
