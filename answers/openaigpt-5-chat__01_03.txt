Alright — let’s break this down exactly per the process you provided.

## **a) Decision Points in Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS Loan-Approval Process**

1. **Risk-Based Underwriting Skip Decision**  
 After the **Tri-Color-Risk-Check**, *if* the combined risk rating is **Low** or **Medium** **and** the requested amount is **≤ €250 000**, the process skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review; otherwise, it proceeds to that review.

2. **TriVote Decision-Gate**  
 At the **TriVote** gate, the loan is approved if **at least two out of the three** required approvers — *Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer* — give approval; otherwise, it fails.

## **b) Documents Required, in Order of First Appearance**

1. **Form 14B** — submitted with the application.  
2. **Scorecard–Cyan**  
3. **Scorecard–Magenta**  
4. **Scorecard–Yellow** — all three are inputs to the Tri-Color-Risk-Check.  
5. **Deck Memo** — produced during Manual-Underwriting-Review (only if that step is not skipped).  
6. **Offer Sheet 77** — prepared when making a binding offer.  
7. **Signed Offer Sheet 77** — returned by the applicant to confirm acceptance.  
8. **ID Matrix Declaration** — provided by applicant at confirmation stage.  
9. **Loan Dossier 2025** — compiled in finalizing the agreement.

If you’d like, I can also draw you a **flowchart** showing both decision branches and document flows so you can see exactly where each arises. Would you like me to produce that?
