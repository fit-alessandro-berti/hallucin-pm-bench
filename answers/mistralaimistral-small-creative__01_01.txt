Here’s a structured summary of **Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process**, focusing **only** on the defined decision points and required documents:

---

### **Decision Points**
1. **Eligibility Validation (Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility)**
   - *Decision*: Is the claim eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?
   - *Outcome*:
     - **Eligible** → Proceed to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**.
     - **Ineligible** → Claim is rejected (no further steps).

2. **High-Value Branch (After Finance_Controller_PreApprove)**
   - *Decision*: Is the refund amount **> €1,000**?
   - *Outcome*:
     - **Yes** → Proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (requires *AuditTrail*).
     - **No** → Skip to **Process_Refund_Payment**.

3. **Payment Authorization (Process_Refund_Payment)**
   - *Decision*: Are **all prerequisites met**?
     - For **low-value claims (≤ €1,000)**: Only **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** must be complete.
     - For **high-value claims (> €1,000)**: Both **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** **and** **Senior_Auditor_Review** must be complete.
   - *Outcome*:
     - **Prerequisites met** → Execute payment (requires *BankTransferAuthorization*).
     - **Prerequisites missing** → Payment cannot proceed (blocked).
