**1️⃣ Count of “Manual Fraud Check”**  
The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** appears **once** in the excerpt (Case 1002 at 2025‑03‑01 09:07:13 UTC).

**2️⃣ Why the snippet can mislead**  
The excerpt covers only a few cases on a single morning of 01 March and omits the majority of the month’s cases, days, and variations in routing (e.g., batches that never trigger manual checks, or later‑stage manual fraud investigations). Selection bias (choosing a narrow time window) and the small sample size mean the observed frequency (1 out of 14 events) is not representative of the whole log, where manual fraud checks could be far more or far less common. Consequently, an analyst basing conclusions solely on this snippet would likely mis‑estimate the true prevalence of manual fraud checks for the full month.
