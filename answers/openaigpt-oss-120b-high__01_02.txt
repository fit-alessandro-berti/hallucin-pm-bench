**Decision points in the Micro‑loan Fast‑Track process**

| Step | Decision point (activity name) | What is decided |
|------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| 5 | **Underwriter Alignment Gate** | Continue only if the two risk scores differ by **≤ 2 points**; otherwise the case is sent to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie‑break. |
| 6 | **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** | The loan proceeds only when **≥ 3 local references** are collected on the Neighbourhood Feedback Form. |
| 7 | **Amount Threshold Decision** | • If **amount < €15 000** → the system **auto‑approves**. <br>• If **amount ≥ €15 000** → the case moves to the **Final Micro‑loan Board Approval (MBA)**. |
| 8 | **Final Micro‑loan Board Approval (MBA)** | The board votes **approve** or **reject** the loan. |
