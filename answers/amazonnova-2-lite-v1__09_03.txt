### Response

**I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval for the activity “Approve Invoice” from the information provided.** 

The event-log stub (Artefact A) contains only the column headers and the first five lines have been entirely redacted—including critical fields such as `case_id`, `activity`, `start_time`, and `complete_time`. Without actual timestamp data for the start and completion of the “Approve Invoice” activity, it is impossible to calculate durations, let alone summary statistics. The corporate SLA catalogue (Artefact B) offers high-level performance targets and historical averages for end-to-end processes but does not supply granular activity-level timing data. Therefore, the required metrics cannot be derived from the supplied artefacts.
