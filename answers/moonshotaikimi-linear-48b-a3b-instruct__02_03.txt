The user asks:

- Q1: How many distinct cases (unique values of the `case` attribute) are present?

We have events in the log, each with a `case` attribute. The cases are:

- C456
- C123
- C789

Thus three distinct cases.

Q2: For case "C456", which activity immediately precedes "Ship_Order"?

We need to look at events for case C456, in chronological order, to find the activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order". The log lines are out of order, so we need to sort them by time for each case.

From the fragment:

Events for case C456 with timestamps:

- Create_Order at 2025-05-10T09:10:00+02:00
- Pack_Items at 2025-05-10T09:35:00+02:00
- Validate_Order at 2025-05-10T09:20:00+02:00
- Ship_Order at 2025-05-10T09:40:00+02:00

So the chronological order for C456 is:

1. Create_Order (09:10)
2. Validate_Order (09:20)
3. Pack_Items (09:35)
4. Ship_Order (09:40)

Thus, the activity immediately preceding "Ship_Order" is "Pack_Items".

Therefore answer: Pack_Items.

Q3: Which activity appears exactly once in the entire fragment?

We need to count the occurrences of each activity across all cases.

List all activities:

- Validate_Order: appears for C456 (09:20) and C123 (09:05). So twice.

- Pack_Items: for C123 (09:15) and C456 (09:35). So twice.

- Cancel_Order: only for C789 (09:45). So once.

- Ship_Order: for C123 (09:25) and C456 (09:40). So twice.

- Create_Order: for C123 (09:00) and C456 (09:10) and C789 (09:30). So three times.

Thus, only "Cancel_Order" appears exactly once.

Therefore answer: Cancel_Order.

So the answers are:

1. 3

2. Pack_Items

3. Cancel_Order

The user wants concise, bullet-point answers only. So we need to format with bullet points.

We should not include any extra text. Just the answers.

Thus:

- Q1: 3

- Q2: Pack_Items

- Q3: Cancel_Order

We should also check that there is no nuance: "Pack_Items" and "Ship_Order" are distinct activities. The question: "For case C456, which activity immediately precedes 'Ship_Order'?" The answer is "Pack_Items". That is correct.

For Q3: "Which activity appears exactly once in the entire fragment?" Cancel_Order appears once.

Thus the final answer.

We should ensure we don't include extra spaces or formatting that might cause misinterpretation. The user wants bullet points. So we can use hyphens or asterisks. The simplest is to list each answer on a separate line with a bullet.

Thus:

- 3

- Pack_Items

- Cancel_Order

But it's better to prefix with the question numbers to be clear.

Potential format:

1. 3
2. Pack_Items
3. Cancel_Order

But the user didn't specify numbering. They just said bullet-point answers only. So we can just list them as bullet points.

Thus final answer:

- 3

- Pack_Items

- Cancel_Order

We'll produce that.

- 3
- Pack_Items
- Cancel_Order
