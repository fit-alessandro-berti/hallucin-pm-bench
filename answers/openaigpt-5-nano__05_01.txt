Improvement: Add an interrupting 48-hour boundary timer event on Task_Check that redirects to Task_Triage if the 48 hours elapse before triage is reached.

- How: Attach a boundary timer (48h) to Task_Check with an outgoing flow to Task_Triage (no new tasks or subprocesses added).
- Why: Ensures every claim reaches Triage within 48 hours from submission (Start_Claim) even if documents are missing or checks are delayed. If the normal flow reaches Triage sooner, the timer is effectively canceled by the engine; no duplicate triage occurs.
