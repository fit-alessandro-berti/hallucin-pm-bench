## Three Worst-Performing Activities

**1. Request_Documents**
- **Issue:** 150-min average wait time (highest) and 22% rework rate (10x process average)
- **Action:** Implement upfront document checklist at claim registration to reduce back-and-forth cycles

**2. Review_Documents**
- **Issue:** 12.4% SLA breach rate (highest) with 30-min queue time and high variability (σ=9 min)
- **Action:** Deploy automated document validation to triage simple cases and reserve manual review for complex claims

**3. Initial_Assessment**
- **Issue:** 18-min wait time despite being the second activity; 3.2% SLA breaches suggest capacity constraint
- **Action:** Add 1–2 FTEs to assessment team to eliminate queue buildup affecting 270 daily cases

---

## Impact Potential
Addressing these three activities targets 90% of total wait time and >60% of SLA breaches. Request_Documents alone accounts for 79% of cumulative queueing delays.

**Recommend prioritizing Request_Documents remediation for immediate ROI.**
