# Analysis

**Answer: No**

## Justification

The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" **always** occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between. This is **not accurate** based on the event log.

### Evidence by Case:

**C001:** 
- Sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items
- ✓ Validate_Payment immediately follows Receive_Order

**C002:** 
- Sequence: Receive_Order → **Pack_Items** → Validate_Payment
- ✗ Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment

**C003:** 
- Sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order
- ✓ Validate_Payment immediately follows Receive_Order

**C004:** 
- Sequence: Receive_Order → **Check_Fraud** → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items
- ✗ Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment

### Conclusion

The FACT is **contradicted** by cases **C002** and **C004**, where other activities (Pack_Items and Check_Fraud, respectively) occur between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment. Since the FACT uses the absolute term "always," even one counterexample is sufficient to disprove it.
