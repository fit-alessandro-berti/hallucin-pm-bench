### Summary

After exploring various firing sequences and examining the dependencies and token flows in the Petri net, we conclude that it is possible for T5 to fire before T3 in some execution traces, specifically in sequences where T5 is enabled before T3 has a chance to fire.

For the sequence where T5 fires before T3, consider the following minimal firing sequence:

\[ T1, T2, T7, T4, T5 \]

In this sequence, T5 fires before T3 is ever enabled (and hence, before it could fire). Thus, the answer to Question 1 is yes, and a minimal sequence is provided for Question 2.

For Question 1, it is indeed possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Answer to Question 1:** Yes, it is possible.

**Answer to Question 2 (bonus):** One minimal firing sequence where T5 fires before T3 is:

\[ T1, T2, T7, T4, T5 \]

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
