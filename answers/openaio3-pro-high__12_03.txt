1. No.

2. Evidence from the log:

• C001: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items  (immediate, so aligns with the claim)  
• C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment  (Pack_Items occurs in-between – violates the claim)  
• C003: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order   (immediate, aligns with the claim)  
• C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items  (Check_Fraud occurs in-between – violates the claim)

Because in cases C002 and C004 “Validate_Payment” is not the first activity after “Receive_Order,” the statement that it “always occurs immediately after” is false.
