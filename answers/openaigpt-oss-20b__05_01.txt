Add an **intermediate boundary timer event** to the exclusive gateway **GW_Docs** that fires **48 hours** after the claim is received.  
When the timer triggers, route the flow directly to **f5 (GW_Docs → Task_Triage)**, bypassing any conditional branch.  
This guarantees that Triage is entered within the SLA without creating new tasks—only the timer event changes the path.
