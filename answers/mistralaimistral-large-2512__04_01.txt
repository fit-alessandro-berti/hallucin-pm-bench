**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 1 violation**: The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, requiring two approvals (Procurement Officer and CFO) **before** `Issue_PO`. While both approvals are present (events 2 and 3), they occur **after** `Expedite_Flag` (event 4) and **immediately before** `Issue_PO` (event 5). The rule mandates approvals **before** `Issue_PO`, but the trace shows `Expedite_Flag` intervening between the CFO approval and `Issue_PO`, implying the approvals were not fully secured prior to issuing the PO.

2. **Rule 2 violation (partial)**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event 4), which makes `Quality_Check` optional. However, `Risk_Assessment` (event 9) occurs **after** the first `Ship_Goods` (event 8), violating the requirement that it must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`.

3. **Rule 4 violation**: Activity `Move_to_Quality` (event 7) is executed by an **Intern** and directly follows `Goods_Received` (event 6), which is executed by a **Warehouse_Clerk** (not the CFO). However, later in the trace, `Three_way_match` (event 10, Accounting) is followed by `Archive_Record` (event 11, System), which does not violate Rule 4. The violation occurs at events 6–7, where an Intern's activity directly follows a non-CFO role (Warehouse_Clerk), which is **not prohibited** by Rule 4. **Correction**: This is **not a violation** of Rule 4, as the rule only prohibits an Intern's activity **directly following** a CFO's activity. The trace does not violate this rule.

4. **Rule 3 compliance**: `Three_way_match` (event 10) occurs within two activities after `Goods_Received` (event 6), satisfying the distance requirement (events 7 and 8 intervene, totaling 2 steps).

5. **Rule 5 compliance**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event 11) and contains no subsequent activities.

**Primary violations**: Rules 1 and 2. Rule 4 is **not violated**. The trace is **Non-compliant**.
