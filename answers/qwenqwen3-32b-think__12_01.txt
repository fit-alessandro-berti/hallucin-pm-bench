The fact is **not accurate**. In **case 1001** and **case 1003**, "Update_Inventory" occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund", contradicting the claim. Additionally, **case 1002** lacks "Update_Inventory" entirely. The sequence "Authorize_Refund immediately before Update_Inventory" does not hold across all cases. 

**Conclusion**: The fact is **false** based on the provided event-log fragment.
