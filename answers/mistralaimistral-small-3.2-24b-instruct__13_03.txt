1️⃣ The exact activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ This snippet shows only **1 manual fraud check** out of **3 total fraud checks** (1 automatic, 1 automatic/automatic, and 1 manual). However, the small sample size (3 cases) may mislead an analyst into underestimating manual fraud checks. The full month-long log could reveal different frequencies, distributions, or triggers for manual checks. Without broader context (e.g., rules for manual vs. automatic checks), this snippet might not reflect the true prevalence of manual interventions.
