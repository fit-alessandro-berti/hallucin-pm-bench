The fact is **not accurate** based on the event-log fragment.  

**Relevant case IDs and activities:**  
- **Case 1001**: "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02), violating the stated sequence.  
- **Case 1003**: "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs **before** "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18), also violating the sequence.  
- **Case 1002**: "Authorize_Refund" (10:18:40) is **not followed by** "Update_Inventory" at all, contradicting the claim.  

In all cases, "Authorize_Refund" does **not** occur immediately before "Update_Inventory" as asserted.
