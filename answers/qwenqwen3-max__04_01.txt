Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 is violated: Because `Expedite_Flag` (event #4) is present, `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` (event #8) occurs at 09:40, while `Risk_Assessment` (event #9) occurs at 10:31 — after shipping, not before.

2. Rule 3 is violated: After `Goods_Received` (event #6), `Three_way_match` (event #10) occurs four activities later (events #7, #8, #9, #10), which exceeds the required maximum distance of two activities. The rule requires it within the next two activities — i.e., by event #8 at the latest.

(Note: Rule 1 is satisfied — both required approvals occur before `Issue_PO`. Rule 4 is satisfied — no Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity. Rule 5 is satisfied — trace ends with `Archive_Record`.)
