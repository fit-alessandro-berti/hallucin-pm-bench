**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 2 violation – Risk_Assessment timing**:  
   The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event 4). According to Rule 2, when `Expedite_Flag` is present, `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at event 9. This violates Rule 2.

2. **Rule 3 violation – Three-way_match timing**:  
   `Goods_Received` occurs at event 6. Rule 3 requires `Three_way_match` to be completed **within the next two activities** (i.e., by event 8 at the latest). However, `Three_way_match` occurs at event 10, which is **four activities after** `Goods_Received` (events 7, 8, 9, 10), exceeding the allowed distance of 2. This violates Rule 3.

Both violations independently render the trace non-compliant.
