COO - Q1-2025 Claims Handling: worst performers and fixes

1) Request_Documents
Why: Clear bottleneck - throughput drops 270->190; longest queue (150 min), highest rework (22%), elevated SLA breaches (5.5%).
Action: Deploy an automated document checklist/completeness gate at submission to cut rework to <=10% and shrink the queue materially.

2) Review_Documents
Why: Longest processing (25 min) and highest variability (stdev 9) drive the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%) and notable rework (5.3%).
Action: Standardize the review with mandatory templates and decision checklists to reduce mean and variation; target SLA breaches <=6%.

3) Initial_Assessment
Why: 3rd-highest wait (18 min), 2nd-longest processing (12 min), and 3rd-highest SLA breaches (3.2%).
Action: Add capacity at this step - at 12 min per case that is ~5 cases/hr per FTE; add one concurrent assessor to cut the queue toward <=10 min and breaches <2%.

The data clearly differentiates these three; other activities show low waits, low rework, and sub-2% SLA breaches.
