**a) Decision points**  
- **Step 4 (conditional branch):** If the Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check yields a Low or Medium risk rating *and* the requested loan amount is ≤ €250 000, the process skips step 5 (Manual‑Underwriting‑Review); otherwise step 5 is executed.  
- **Step 6 (TriVote gate):** The loan passes this gate only if at least two of the three designated officers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve; otherwise the loan is rejected.
