Decision points

- Quick KYC Verification (KYC)  
  - Confirm ID card and mobile phone. Only if confirmed does the application proceed to Community Impact Assessment (CIA); if not confirmed, the application does not proceed.

- Underwriter Alignment Gate  
  - Compare Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B risk scores (0–9).  
  - If the two scores differ by ≤ 2 points, continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC).  
  - Else, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision, then continue to NFC.

- Amount Threshold Decision  
  - After Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC):  
    - If amount < €15 000, the system auto-approves.  
    - If amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).

- Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)  
  - Board votes approve or reject. If approve, proceed to Disburse Funds; if reject, the application is declined.
