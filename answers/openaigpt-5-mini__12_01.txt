No. The log does not support that claim.

- Case 1001: Update_Inventory (2025-03-01 08:25:55) occurs before Authorize_Refund (2025-03-01 08:30:02) — Authorize_Refund is not immediately before Update_Inventory.  
- Case 1003: Update_Inventory (2025-03-03 10:08:07) occurs before Authorize_Refund (2025-03-03 10:22:18) — again Authorize_Refund is not immediately before Update_Inventory.  
- Case 1002: Authorize_Refund (2025-03-02 10:18:40) occurs but there is no Update_Inventory event in that case, so the claimed immediate-before relation cannot hold.

Based on the fragment, the fact is inaccurate.
