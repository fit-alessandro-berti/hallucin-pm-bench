Non-compliant

1. Rule 1 states that any PO exceeding â‚¬10,000 requires two approvals: Procurement Officer and CFO. This trace includes two `Approve_PO` activities, one by a Procurement Officer and one by a CFO. However, there's an additional `Approve_PO_CFO` activity, which is acceptable, fulfilling the two-approval requirement.

2. Rule 3 states that `Three_way_match` must occur within two activities after `Goods_Received`. In this trace, `Three_way_match` is executed after `Goods_Received` and before `Archive_Record`, which is within the specified distance.

3. Rule 4 states that an activity executed by an Intern cannot directly follow an activity executed by a CFO. This trace includes an `Move_to_Quality` activity executed by an Intern immediately after `Approve_PO_CFO` executed by a CFO. This violates rule 4.

4. Rule 5 states the trace must finish with `Archive_Record` and contain nothing after it. This trace does include `Archive_Record`, but it also contains `Ship_Goods` after it.
