Subject: Analysis of Worst-Performing Activities and Improvement Recommendations

Our analysis highlights three activities with the most significant SLA breaches combined with high average waiting times:  

1. Legal Approval exceeds its SLA of 600 seconds by 300 seconds, averaging 900 seconds throughput time, with a waiting time of 600 seconds.  
2. Risk Review surpasses its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, averaging 600 seconds throughput time, with an average waiting time of 480 seconds.  
3. Credit Assessment breaches its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, with an average throughput time of 300 seconds and waiting time of 200 seconds.  

Recommendations:  
- Legal Approval: Implement targeted process optimization or resource reallocation to reduce queue delays, focusing on the 600-second waiting time.  
- Risk Review: Introduce parallel processing or prioritize cases to lower the substantial 480-second waiting period.  
- Credit Assessment: Analyze bottlenecks contributing to the 200-second wait and streamline verification steps to meet the 240-second SLA.
