### Suggested XML Improvement

Add a **Boundary Timer Event** attached to the existing "Create Account in Core System" task and connect it to the existing (but currently disconnected) "Account-Manager Review" task via a **Boundary Event Sequence Flow**.

```xml
<bpmn:boundaryEvent id="Timer_SLA_48h" name="48-hour limit" attachedToRef="Activity_CreateAccount" cancelActivity="true">
  <bpmn:timerEventDefinition id="TimerEventDefinition_01">
    <bpmn:timeDuration xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression">PT48H</bpmn:timeDuration>
  </bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
</bpmn:boundaryEvent>

<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="Flow_Escalation" sourceRef="Timer_SLA_48h" targetRef="Activity_AMReview" />
```

**Justification:**  
This implementation leverages the existing "Account-Manager Review" task as a recovery path, automatically escalating delayed automated account creations to manual intervention the moment the 48-hour SLA is breached.
