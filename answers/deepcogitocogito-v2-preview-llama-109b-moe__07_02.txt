Okay, I need to compare these two BPMN XML versions and summarize the changes under the headings: Added tasks, Removed tasks, and Gateway-type changes. Let me start by looking at each version one by one.

First, BPMN_v1 has the following tasks: Review Application, Approve Loan, Reject Loan. There are three sequence flows out of the exclusive gateway: yes to Approve Loan and no to Reject Loan. Both tasks end up at the EndEvent.

In BPMN_v2, the start event flows to Verify Identity, then Review Application. The gateway is now inclusive, leading to Auto-Approve Loan (if eligible), Request Additional Documents (if missing docs), or Final Reject (if ineligible). There's also a new task, Final Reject, and the flows from the gateway now have different labels. The Verify Identity task is new.

Looking at added tasks: v2 has Verify Identity and Request Additional Documents, and renamed Approve Loan to Auto-Approve Loan. However, Ignore cosmetic renamings so Auto-Approve Loan is just considered a rename of Approve Loan, but that's allowed to be ignored unless it's not just a name change.

Removed tasks: Reject Loan is replaced by Final Reject. But since the gateway type changed from exclusive to inclusive, Auto-Approve Loan, Request Docs, and Final Reject are all different paths, so maybe Reject Loan is actually removed.

Gateway-type changes: Changed from exclusive to inclusive, which is a gateway-type change.

Added tasks: Verify Identity, Request Additional Documents

Removed tasks: The original Reject Loan task

Gateway-type changes: From Exclusive Gateway (Eligible?) to Inclusive Gateway (Eligibility Check)

Renamed tasks like Approve Loan to Auto-Approve Loan are cosmetic unless they represent a functional change, but instruction says to ignore them if just renamings.

So added tasks are Verify Identity and Request Additional Documents.

Removed tasks is Task_RejectLoan.

Gateway-type change is Exclusive to Inclusive.

That's it. I should double-check there's no other task differences. In BPMN_v1, the tasks are ReviewApplication, ApproveLoan, RejectLoan. In v2, we have VerifyIdentity, ReviewApplication, Auto-ApproveLoan, RequestDocs, FinalReject. Review Application remains, so not a new task. Verify Identity and Request Docs are new, Final Reject replaces Reject Loan but since they're not exactly the same name, it's a removal and addition.

Finalize that list.
### Added tasks
- `Task_VerifyIdentity`: New verification step added at the beginning of the process
- `Task_RequestDocs`: New task to handle requests for additional documentation
- `Task_FinalReject`: New task for final rejection process

### Removed tasks
- `Task_RejectLoan`: Removed from the process flow

### Gateway-type changes
- Changed from `exclusiveGateway` (v1) to `inclusiveGateway` (v2), allowing multiple concurrent paths based on different conditions
- Handling simplified from binary (yes/no) to three-way decision (eligible/missing docs/ineligible)
