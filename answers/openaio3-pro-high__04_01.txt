Non-compliant  

1. Rule 1: Met – Approve_PO (Procurement Officer, #2) precedes Approve_PO_CFO (CFO, #3); both occur before Issue_PO (#5).  
2. Rule 2: Violated – Expedite_Flag is present (#4), but Risk_Assessment (#9) comes after the first Ship_Goods (#8); it must occur before.  
3. Rule 3: Violated – Three_way_match (#10) happens four steps after Goods_Received (#6); it must occur within two subsequent activities.  
4. Rule 4: Met – No Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity (CFO at #3 is followed by System at #4).  
5. Rule 5: Met – The trace ends with Archive_Record (#11) and nothing follows it.
