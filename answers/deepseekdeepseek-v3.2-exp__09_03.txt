Based on the information provided, I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice."

The reason is that Artefact A, the event log, contains no actual data. The log stub has had every row of data and every timestamp value redacted for privacy. To compute the requested metrics, specific timestamp values from the `start_time` and `complete_time` columns for the "Approve Invoice" activity are required. Since these values are unavailable, performing any time-based calculations is impossible. Artefact B provides a historical average for a larger process segment but does not contain the necessary granular data for the specific activity analysis requested.
