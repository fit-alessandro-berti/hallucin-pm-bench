**No.**

**Justification:**
Based on the event-log excerpt, the activity “Validate_Payment” does not always occur immediately after “Receive_Order.” In several cases, other activities are interleaved between them:

*   **Case C002:** The activity **"Pack_Items"** occurs between "Receive_Order" (09:30:00) and "Validate_Payment" (10:05:00).
*   **Case C004:** The activity **"Check_Fraud"** occurs between "Receive_Order" (10:05:00) and "Validate_Payment" (10:20:00).

The fact is only true for cases **C001** and **C003**, but it is not a process-wide rule.
