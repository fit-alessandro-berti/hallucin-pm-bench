I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" because the event log contains no actual timestamp dataâ€”only column headers are provided, and all row values, including start_time and complete_time, have been redacted. Without observed start and completion times for the "Approve Invoice" activity, it is impossible to calculate duration metrics, let alone their variability or confidence intervals. Any numerical estimate would be speculative and violates the constraint to use only the provided artefacts.
