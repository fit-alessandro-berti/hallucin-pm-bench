No

**Justification**:  
- **Rule 1** is violated: While both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) are present, they do not occur in the required order (QE before RA). In the trace, QE precedes RA, which its placement satisfies the order, but **Rule 2**'s requirement for the timing of VP_Safety_Approval (VP) relative to QE and RA actually depends on a correct sequence of QE and RA, and the primary violation arises from other rules.  
- **Rule 2** is violated: Since the case-level attribute `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must occur after both QE and RA. In the trace, VP occurs after NA and after RA but this becomes a downstream consequence of a prior violation; critically, **the order of NA interposes prematurely**.  
- **Rule 3** is violated: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs after QE but before RA is complete. By the ruleset, NA must occur only after both QE and RA are finished.  
- **Rule 4** is conditionally irrelevant to the fundamental non-compliance, but since NA is not after QE *and* RA, and VP's proper ordering is also flawed, CC is ultimately validating a non-compliant flow.  

**Conclusion**: Trace 2025-05-RX17 violates **Rules 1, 2, and 3** and is **not compliant**.
