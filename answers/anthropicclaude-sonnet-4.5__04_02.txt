# Compliance Audit for Case #47291

## Rule-by-Rule Analysis

**R1: Violated**
Total €12,450 > €10,000 requires Manager_Approval then Finance_Approval. Both occurred (events 2, 3) but Change_Request invalidated them.

**R2: Violated**
Expedited = true requires Ship_Goods within 2 days after last required approval. Event 8 (new Manager_Approval 2025-03-07) lacks subsequent Finance_Approval.

**R3: Violated**
Pay_Invoice (event 7, 2025-03-06 09:00) occurred before Receive_Goods (event 6, 2025-03-07 14:13). Direct violation.

**R4: Not Applicable**
Hazardous = false, so Safety_Inspection requirement does not apply to this case.

**R5: Violated**
Change_Request (event 4) occurred after approvals. New Manager_Approval obtained (event 8) but Ship_Goods (event 5) already processed beforehand.

**R6: Compliant**
Case terminates with Archive_Record (event 10, 2025-03-07 16:20) as required.

## Overall Result

**NON-COMPLIANT**
