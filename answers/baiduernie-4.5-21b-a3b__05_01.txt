To ensure claims reach Triage within 48 hours, attach a **timer boundary event** to the sequence flow **f2** (from *Task_Receive* to *Task_Check*). This event triggers an **alert** if the task exceeds 48 hours. The alert can route the claim to an auto-escalation subprocess (not required per constraints). Modify *Task_Check*â€™s start event to use *Task_Check_Timer*, with the (*tFormalExpression*) set to count time from *Start_Claim*. If the timer fires, flow to the escalation subprocess (adjust *JP_Escalation* for this). This maintains SLA without new tasks.
