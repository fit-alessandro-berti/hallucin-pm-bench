I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity. The event-log stub (Artefact A) explicitly states that all rows and timestamp values—including start_time and complete_time—were redacted for privacy, leaving only column headers. Without any timestamp data, it is impossible to calculate durations for any activity, including "Approve Invoice". The SLA excerpt (Artefact B) provides an average *handover time* between "Approve Invoice" and "Pay Invoice" (7.8 days), not the *cycle time* (start-to-complete duration) of "Approve Invoice" itself, and offers no raw data points, variance metrics, or timestamps required for the requested calculations. No usable data exists in the provided artefacts for these computations.
