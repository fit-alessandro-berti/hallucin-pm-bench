Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling — worst-performing activities & actions

- **Request_Documents**: Under-performs on every delay/quality indicator: **150 min avg wait** (highest), **22.0% rework** (highest), **5.5% SLA breaches**, and reduced throughput (**190/day** vs **270/day** upstream). **Action:** standardize/automate document collection (single checklist + customer upload with completeness validation) to directly cut repeats; target **rework <10%** and **wait <60 min**.

- **Review_Documents**: Primary execution/SLA risk: **25 min avg processing** (highest), **stdev 9** (highest variability), **12.4% SLA breaches** (highest), and low throughput (**185/day**). **Action:** implement complexity-based routing with standardized review templates to reduce variation; target **stdev ≤4** and **SLA breaches <6%**.

- **Initial_Assessment**: Clear queue buildup vs work time (**18 min wait** vs **12 min processing**) and elevated **3.2% SLA breaches** (highest outside document steps). **Action:** rebalance capacity into Initial_Assessment (cross-train from low-wait steps) to drive **wait <8 min**.
