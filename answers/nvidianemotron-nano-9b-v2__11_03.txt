**Executive Memo to COO**  

The three worst-performing activities, based on joint analysis of SLA breaches and high waiting times, are **Risk Review**, **Legal Approval**, and **Credit Assessment**.  

- **Risk Review** exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds in throughput time (600s vs. 300s target) and 180 seconds in waiting time (480s vs. 300s target). This dual breach indicates systemic inefficiencies requiring immediate intervention.  
- **Legal Approval** exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds in throughput time (900s vs. 600s target), though waiting time is exactly on target. The prolonged throughput suggests bottlenecks in legal processes.  
- **Credit Assessment** exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds in throughput time (300s vs. 240s target), with waiting time under the target. However, the throughput overrun highlights a need for process optimization.  

**Recommendations**:  
- **Risk Review**: Implement parallel processing or automation to reduce throughput and waiting times by 50% within 30 days.  
- **Legal Approval**: Introduce a streamlined approval workflow or delegate tasks to reduce throughput time by 300 seconds.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Conduct a root-cause analysis of the throughput delay and adjust resource allocation to meet the 240s SLA.
