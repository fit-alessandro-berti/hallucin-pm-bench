I need to determine the average cycle time for the "Dual Authorization" activity from start to completion. The frequency table provides the number of occurrences, but it lacks timestamps, which are crucial for calculating cycle time. Since there’s no time information like min, max, or average duration, I can’t compute the average cycle time. The process mining field shows that without timestamps, calculating durations is impossible, as they only represent event frequencies and lifecycle transitions.

The instructions are clear: I need to provide one concise sentence explaining why I can't calculate the average cycle time for "Dual Authorization." The reason is that the log lacks timestamps, which are essential for measuring durations. Thus, I should simply state that it's not possible to compute due to the absence of timestamp information. I'll make sure to keep it concise, and my response will focus solely on explaining the inability to compute the average cycle time.

Cannot be determined: the supplied log lacks timestamps, so the duration from Dual Authorization start to completion cannot be measured.
