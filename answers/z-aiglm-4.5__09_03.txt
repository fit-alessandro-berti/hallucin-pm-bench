I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity based solely on the provided artefacts. Artefact A contains only column headers (including start_time and complete_time) but redacts all actual data rows and timestamp values, meaning there are no observations or durations available for any activity. Artefact B provides contextual SLAs and a historical average but contains no raw event log data or timestamps relevant to calculating cycle times. Without access to the actual start_time and complete_time values for instances of "Approve Invoice," no quantitative analysis of cycle time is possible.
