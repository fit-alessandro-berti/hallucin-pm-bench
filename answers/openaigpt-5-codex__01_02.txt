**Decision points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track process**

- **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – compares the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B; if the scores differ by more than 2 points, the case is escalated.  
- **Harmonisation Committee** (triggered by the Underwriter Alignment Gate) – renders the tie-break decision before the workflow can proceed.  
- **Amount Threshold Decision** – routes applications: amounts under €15 000 receive system auto-approval, while amounts ≥ €15 000 advance to the Micro-loan Board.  
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – the Micro-loan Board issues the definitive approve or reject vote for applications at or above €15 000.
