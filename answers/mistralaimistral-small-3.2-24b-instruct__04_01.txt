**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity #4), which requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Risk_Assessment` (activity #9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` (activity #8).

2. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (activity #6), `Three_way_match` (activity #10) is completed **three activities later** (distance = 3), violating the requirement of within the next two activities (distance â‰¤ 2).

3. **Rule 4 violation**: Activity `Move_to_Quality` (activity #7) is executed by the role **Intern** and directly follows activity `Goods_Received` (activity #6), which was executed by the role **Warehouse_Clerk** (not the CFO). However, this does not violate Rule 4, as the rule only prohibits **Intern** directly following **CFO**. (Correction: This point is incorrect; the actual violation is Rule 2 and 3 as above.)

**Correction**: The primary violations are Rule 2 and Rule 3. Rule 4 is not violated in this trace.

**Final Answer**: **Non-compliant** (Rules 2 and 3).
