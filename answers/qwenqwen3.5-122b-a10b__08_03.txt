**Yes**

**Shortest Firing Sequence:**
T1, T2b, T4, T5

**Verification of Reachability:**
1.  **Initial Marking (M0):** `p0=1`
2.  **Fire T1:** Consumes `p0`, produces `pa`, `pb`. (Marking: `pa=1`, `pb=1`)
3.  **Fire T2b:** Consumes `pa`, produces `pd`. (Marking: `pb=1`, `pd=1`)
    *   *Note: T3 requires `pc`, which is not produced here.*
4.  **Fire T4:** Consumes `pb`, produces `pe`. (Marking: `pd=1`, `pe=1`)
5.  **Fire T5:** Consumes `pd`, `pe`, produces `pf`. (Marking: `pf=1`)

In this sequence, **T5** fires successfully. **T3** never fires (as `pc` is never marked), satisfying the condition that T5 fires before T3. The transition **T2b** acts as the "shortcut" allowing `pd` to be generated without traversing the `pc` place required by T3.
