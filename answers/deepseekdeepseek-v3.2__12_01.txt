The fact is **not accurate**.

- In **Case 1001**, the activities occur in the order: Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund (not the reverse).  
- In **Case 1003**, Update_Inventory occurs before Authorize_Refund, with Quality_Check intervening, so they are neither consecutive nor in the claimed order.  
- In **Case 1002**, Authorize_Refund occurs without any Update_Inventory activity at all.

Thus, the data show no instance where Authorize_Refund immediately precedes Update_Inventory.
