No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Proof of Impossibility:**

Transition T5 requires a token in place p3 to be enabled. Place p3 *only* receives a token when transition T2 fires. Transition T2 requires a token in place p1 to fire. Place p1 *only* receives a token when transition T1 fires. Transition T1 splits tokens from p0 into p1 *and* p2 simultaneously.  

However, T5 has an inhibitor arc from p4. For T5 to fire, p4 *must* be empty (contain zero tokens). Place p4 only receives tokens when transition T3 fires.  

Therefore, for T5 to even *be enabled*, T3 must have fired first to potentially fill p4, then *not* have left tokens in p4. But T3 receives its token from p2, and p2 receives its token *simultaneously* with p1 from T1. Thus, T3 cannot fire before T1 and T2.

Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3, because T3 must fire (and then leave p4 empty) before T5 can even be enabled. T3 and T1 fire in parallel, but T5 cannot fire until after p4 is possibly (but not necessarily) filled and emptied by T3.
