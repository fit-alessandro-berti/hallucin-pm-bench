No

- Rule 1 – order of QE and RA: violated.  QE appears before RA but NA occurs between them; per rule 1 QE and RA must occur immediately consecutively in that order (QE then RA) with no intervening activities, which is broken here.

- Rule 2 – VP after QE & RA when severity=High: violated.  VP does come later, but because RA has not completed before NA, the prerequisite (QE and RA complete before VP) is not met.  Additionally, once RA is complete VP comes next, but NA no longer meets its ordering constraint of occurring only after both QE and RA.

- Rule 3 – NA after QE and RA: violated.  NA happens right after QE, i.e., before RA has finished.

- Rule 4 – CC after NA (and VP if required): complies in the literal sequence shown (CC comes last), but the sourcing violations above make any final compliance moot.
