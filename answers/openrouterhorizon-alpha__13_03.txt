1) Count of exact activity “Manual Fraud Check”: 1

2) Reasons for possible misestimation:
- The snippet is a tiny, non-random slice (only a few cases and ~1 hour window), not representative of the month.
- Activity naming inconsistency exists (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check” vs “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), so analysts might miss other manual variants or misclassify.
- Duplicates or rework elsewhere in the month aren’t visible here.
- Selection bias: these cases may be atypical (e.g., early-morning processing patterns).
- Missing lifecycle variants (only “complete”) could hide starts/cancellations that affect perceived frequency.
- Later lines show repeated activities for the same case, hinting that partial views can distort relative frequencies.
