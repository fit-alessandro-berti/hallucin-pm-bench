Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in this Petri net. 

Here's one shortest firing sequence that achieves this:

**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

Explanation:
1. T1 fires (parallel split): consumes p0, produces pa and pb
2. T2b fires (shortcut): consumes pa, produces pd
3. T4 fires: consumes pb, produces pe
4. T5 fires (synchronizing join): consumes pd and pe, produces pf

In this sequence, T3 is completely bypassed through the alternative T2b path while reaching the necessary tokens in pd and pe for T5 to fire.
