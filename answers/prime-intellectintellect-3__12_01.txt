Based solely on the provided event-log fragment, the fact is **inaccurate**.

**Justification:**

1.  **Case 1001:** The sequence is `Update_Inventory` -> `Authorize_Refund`. Here, `Update_Inventory` occurs *before* `Authorize_Refund`, contradicting the claim that `Authorize_Refund` occurs immediately before `Update_Inventory`.
2.  **Case 1002:** `Update_Inventory` does not occur at all. Therefore, the pair `Authorize_Refund` and `Update_Inventory` does not exist in this case, meaning `Authorize_Refund` cannot occur immediately before `Update_Inventory` here.
3.  **Case 1003:** The sequence is `Update_Inventory` -> `Quality_Check` -> `Authorize_Refund`. Again, `Update_Inventory` occurs *before* `Authorize_Refund`, contradicting the claim.

**Conclusion:** The event-log fragment shows instances where `Update_Inventory` precedes `Authorize_Refund` (Cases 1001, 1003) and a case where `Update_Inventory` is missing (Case 1002). There is **no case** where `Authorize_Refund` occurs immediately before `Update_Inventory`. The data directly contradicts the fact.
