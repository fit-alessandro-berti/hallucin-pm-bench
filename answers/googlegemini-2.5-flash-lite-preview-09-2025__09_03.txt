1.  I cannot compute the average cycle time (in hours) of activity "Approve Invoice" from the supplied information.
2.  I cannot provide the standard deviation or a 95% confidence interval because the necessary data, specifically the start and complete timestamps for the "Approve Invoice" activity within the event log (Artefact A), have been redacted.
3.  I cannot compute any metric exactly because Artefact A, the event log stub, contains no actual data rows, only the header names, meaning there are no timestamps from which to calculate durations, averages, or variations for any activity, including "Approve Invoice."
