**MEMO TO:** Chief Operating Officer  
**FROM:** Senior Process Performance Analyst  
**RE:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance - Critical Issues

Our Q1 analysis identifies three activities requiring immediate intervention:

**1. Request_Documents** (Most Critical)
- **Issue:** 150-minute average wait time and 22% rework rate, creating severe bottleneck with throughput dropping from 270 to 190 cases/day
- **Action:** Implement automated document checklist validation to reduce rework from 22% to <5%, which would restore ~50 cases/day capacity

**2. Review_Documents**
- **Issue:** Highest SLA breach rate at 12.4%, with 25-minute processing time and high variability (9-minute stdev)
- **Action:** Deploy standardized review templates and decision trees to reduce processing time variability by 50%, targeting <6% SLA breaches

**3. Initial_Assessment**
- **Issue:** 18-minute wait time (second highest) with 3.2% SLA breaches despite early process positioning
- **Action:** Add parallel processing capacity during peak hours to reduce wait time to <10 minutes

These three activities account for the majority of process delays and customer dissatisfaction. The Request_Documents bottleneck alone reduces our daily capacity by 30%.

Recommended implementation priority follows the order above, with Request_Documents automation delivering highest ROI.
