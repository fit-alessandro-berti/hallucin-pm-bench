We will show that T5 can indeed fire before T3. Consider the following firing sequence starting from the initial marking:

1. Fire T1 (parallel split):
  • p0 loses its token.
  • p1 and p2 each receive one token.
  Marking: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0).

2. Fire T2:
  • Consumes the token from p1 and produces a token in p3.
  Marking: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0).

3. Fire T5:
  • T5 requires a token in p3 (which we have) and is enabled only if p4 is empty (p4 = 0, so the inhibitor condition holds).
  • Firing T5 consumes a token from p3 and produces a token in p6.
  Marking after T5: p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1).

Notice that T3 (which would have moved the token from p2 to p4) has not yet fired when T5 fires. The key is that after T1 the token in p2 is not forced to fire T3 immediately; we may choose to fire T2 (and then T5) first because the net is concurrent.

Thus, the concrete sequence T1 → T2 → T5 demonstrates that transition T5 can indeed fire before T3.
