To calculate the average cycle time for the activity "Review Contract" across all cases in the provided log, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relevant entries**: We look at the "Review Contract" activity in the log and note the elapsed time for each instance.
2. **Sum the durations**: Add up the durations of all "Review Contract" activities.
3. **Count the occurrences**: Determine how many times the "Review Contract" activity occurred.
4. **Calculate the average**: Divide the total sum of durations by the count of occurrences.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify the relevant entries**:
   - From the log, the "Review Contract" activity appears in the following rows:
     - C-001: Review Contract
     - C-002: Review Contract
     - C-004: Review Contract

2. **Sum the durations**:
   - The durations for these entries are:
     - C-001: 0.5 hours
     - C-002: 0.5 hours
     - C-004: 0.5 hours
   - Total duration = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours

3. **Count the occurrences**:
   - The "Review Contract" activity occurred 3 times.

4. **Calculate the average**:
   - Average duration = Total duration / Number of occurrences
   - Average duration = 1.5 hours / 3 = 0.5 hours

### Conclusion:
The average cycle time for the activity "Review Contract" across all cases in the log is **0.5 hours**.

### Explanation:
The calculation involves summing the individual durations of the "Review Contract" activity across all cases and then dividing by the total number of occurrences of that activity. This provides a straightforward measure of the average time taken for this specific activity in the given dataset.
