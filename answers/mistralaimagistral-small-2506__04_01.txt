**Non-compliant**

**Justification:**
1. The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity #4), but `Risk_Assessment` (activity #9) occurs after the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods` (activity #8), violating rule 2 which requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** `Ship_Goods`.
2. After `Goods_Received` (activity #6), `Three_way_match` (activity #10) is completed within the next two activities (activities #8 and #10), adhering to rule 3.
3. Activities by `Intern` (activity #7) follow `CFO` (activity #3), violating rule 4 which prohibits this sequence.
4. The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (activity #11) and has no following activities, satisfying rule 5.

*Note: Multiple rule violations exist, but the most critical ones are citation 1 and 3.*
