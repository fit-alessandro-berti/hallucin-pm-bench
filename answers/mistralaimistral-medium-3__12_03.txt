1. **No**

2. **Justification:**
   - **CaseID C001:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` (immediate, no other activities in between).
   - **CaseID C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment` (not immediate; `Pack_Items` occurs between them).
   - **CaseID C003:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` (immediate, no other activities in between).
   - **CaseID C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment` (not immediate; `Check_Fraud` occurs between them).

Since **C002** and **C004** have activities between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, the FACT is **not universally accurate** for all cases in the log.
