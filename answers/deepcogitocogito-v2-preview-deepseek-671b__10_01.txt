Okay, let me break down what I need to do here. The user wants a RACI matrix for FinCo's order-to-cash workflow, but there's a strict vocabulary policy I must follow. The process has six steps, and I need to map each step to the responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed roles. First, I need to list the activities using only the permitted terms. 

Original step 1 is "Receive Application" – that's acceptable as is. Step 2 is labeled "Customer Due Diligence" but I must replace it with **KYC Review**. Step 3 is "Order Validation" but the term needs to be **Order Vetting**. Then step 4 is "Payment Processing," which becomes **Payment Clearance**. Steps 5 and 6 can stay the same. 

For the RACI, I'll list each activity as a row and the roles as columns: Account Manager (AM), Compliance Officer (CO), Finance Clerk (FC), and IT Support (IT). 

Going through each step:
1. Receive Application – AM performs this, so they're Responsible (R). Since they own the activity, they're also Accountable (A).
2. KYC Review – CO handles this, so they're R and A. 
3. Order Vetting – AM is involved here. They likely approve, so A and R for them.
4. Payment Clearance – FC is R and A.
5. Record Update – IT would be R and A.
6. Notify Customer – AM is R and A again.

I need to check if any step requires being Consulted (C) or Informed (I). For instance, during KYC, might the Account Manager be Informed? The provided descriptions don't specify any consultations, so I should stick to R and A unless the context implies otherwise. 

Wait, in the initial process, step 3 (Order Vetting) is checked by the Account Manager. Assuming they only do it themselves, no consultation is mentioned. Same for other steps. 

Also, looking at the original roles and steps, only one role is involved per step, so only R and A would apply. C and I might be optional, but if the process doesn't mention it, I shouldn't add them. Let me double-check:

- For each step, is there any interaction or handoff implied? For example, does the Compliance Officer inform the Account Manager when KYC is done? The process says nothing beyond each step's owner, so the safest route is to leave C and I blank unless specified. 

I think that's correct. The RACI matrix will have each activity mapped to the role with R and A, and leave C and I as empty. This fits the minimal structure given the provided information.

Final steps: Create the matrix with headers for each role and mark R and A in the appropriate columns for each step, ensuring the correct vocabulary. Make sure there are no mentions of the forbidden terms anywhere.
Here's the RACI matrix for FinCo's order-to-cash workflow:

| Activity                           | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1. Receive Application            | R, A                |                          |                     |                 |
| 2. KYC Review                     |                     | R, A                    |                     |                 |
| 3. Order Vetting                  | R, A                |                          |                     |                 |
| 4. Payment Clearance             |                     |                          | R, A                |                 |
| 5. Record Update                  |                     |                          |                     | R, A            |
| 6. Notify Customer                | R, A                |                          |                     |                 |

Note: For simplicity, only Responsible (R) and Accountable (A) are shown where specified in the process description. Consulted (C) and Informed (I) are not included as they were not explicitly mentioned in the workflow.
