1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt (Case C05).  

2.  
   a) **Percentage of all events (48 total)**:  
      \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 = 2.08\% \).  
   b) **Percentage of all unique cases (12 total)**:  
      \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 = 8.33\% \).  

3. A low-support activity (like **Manual_Fraud_Check**) can mislead analyses because generalizing from rare instances may overestimate its impact or misrepresent its typical role. Predictive models might falsely associate it with outcomes (e.g., **Approve_Payout** in C05), while performance metrics (e.g., time) could skew if the activity is atypical. Sampling bias risks conflating outliers with trends.
