I cannot compute the average cycle time of “Approve Invoice,” the standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval because Artefact A contains no event rows—only the column headers. Cycle time requires, for each “Approve Invoice” occurrence, start and complete timestamps (or lifecycle start/complete pairs) to derive per-event durations and the sample size; none of these data are present. The SLA/KPI figures in Artefact B concern payment timeliness and the lag from “Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice,” which are not the activity’s own execution time and cannot substitute for the missing log data.
