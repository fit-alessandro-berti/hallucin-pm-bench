**Executive Memo: Orion Credit Performance Review**

To Orion Creditâ€™s COO,

This memo highlights the three worst-performing activities from the recent process data, considering both SLA breaches and elevated waiting times.

1. **Legal Approval** is the most problematic activity. It exceeds its 600-second SLA by an average of 300 seconds (avg. throughput time: 900s). Its waiting time (600s) also strains process efficiency.  
2. **Risk Review** significantly exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (avg. throughput time: 600s vs. target: 300s). The waiting time (480s) amplifies delays.  
3. **Credit Assessment** exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds (avg. throughput time: 300s vs. target: 240s), and its wait time (200s) remains high.

**Actionable recommendations:**  
- Conduct a root-cause analysis of Legal Approval to identify bottlenecks and optimize review procedures.  
- Prioritize automation or increase workforce allocation for Risk Review to reduce processing delays.  
- Redesign Credit Assessment workflows to improve speed, possibly through decision tables or pre-vetting rules.
