1. The average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the given log data because the timestamps or elapsed-time fields have been redacted.

2. To calculate the average cycle time, we would need the start and end timestamps for each instance of "Review Contract". The provided log contains only the case_id, activity, and resource, without any timing information. Hence, it's not possible to compute the average cycle time for "Review Contract" based on the given data.
