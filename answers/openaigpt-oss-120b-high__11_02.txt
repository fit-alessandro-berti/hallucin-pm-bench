**To:** Chief Operating Officer, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process‑Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Q1‑2025 Claims‑Handling – Top Three Activity Bottlenecks  

**Key findings** – The three activities that most impair overall performance are:

| Activity | Primary pain points (from data) |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| **Request Documents** | Avg wait = 150 min (≈ 8 × the next highest); rework = 22 % (far above the 0‑5 % range); SLA breach = 5.5 %. |
| **Review Documents** | Avg processing = 25 min and stdev = 9 min (high duration & variability); rework = 5.3 %; SLA breach = 12.4 % (the highest across the process). |
| **Initial Assessment** | Avg wait = 18 min (second‑largest queue time); SLA breach = 3.2 % (elevated vs. ≤1 % for downstream steps). |

**Why they under‑perform**  
- **Request Documents** suffers from prolonged queueing and frequent repeats, indicating manual, asynchronous requests.  
- **Review Documents** shows long, inconsistent processing and the greatest SLA breach, suggesting a lack of standardized validation.  
- **Initial Assessment**’s queue is driven by downstream delays (e.g., missing documents) and leads to missed SLA windows.

**Data‑driven actions**  
1. **Request Documents:** Deploy an automated client portal that triggers real‑time document upload requests, cutting average wait by >30 % and rework by ~15 % (target ≤ 7 % rework).  
2. **Review Documents:** Introduce AI‑assisted document extraction and validation to standardize processing, aiming to reduce avg processing to ≤ 15 min and SLA breach to < 5 %.  
3. **Initial Assessment:** Implement rule‑based triage (e.g., pre‑screened claim types) to prioritize ready cases, expected to lower avg wait to ≤ 10 min and SLA breach by half.

Addressing these three hotspots should improve end‑to‑end cycle time and SLA compliance before the next quarter.
