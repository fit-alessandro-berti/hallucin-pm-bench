2) Percentages
- a) All events: 2.08%
- b) All unique cases (12 total): 8.33%

3) Explanation (â‰¤100 words):
Manual_Fraud_Check appears in only one of 48 events (2.08% per-event) and in 1 of 12 cases (8.33% per-case). As a low-support activity, it introduces high variance and instability in performance estimates and predictive models. Relying on it can overstate its importance or create misleading signals, since a single instance may disproportionately influence metrics or learned thresholds. Generalizing from such sparse data risks overfitting to this slice and miscalibrating decisions when applied to broader, real-world datasets with different frequencies.More data is needed to assess true impact.
