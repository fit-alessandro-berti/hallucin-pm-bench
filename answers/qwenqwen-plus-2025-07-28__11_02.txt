Three activities show significant performance gaps:  

1. **Request_Documents**: Lowest throughput (190/day) and highest wait time (150 min), indicating a severe bottleneck. Long waits suggest delays in document collection. *Action: Automate document requests via customer portal to reduce queue time.*  

2. **Review_Documents**: High processing time (25 min) and variability (stdev=9), with the highest SLA breaches (12.4%). Inconsistent execution impacts quality and speed. *Action: Standardize review checklists and provide targeted training to reduce variation.*  

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Despite moderate processing time, it has the second-highest wait time (18 min) and elevated rework (1.8%), leading to throughput drag. *Action: Rebalance workload across assessors to reduce idle time and prevent backlog buildup.*  

These three represent the largest improvement opportunities. Addressing them will increase flow, reduce SLA breaches, and improve customer experience.
