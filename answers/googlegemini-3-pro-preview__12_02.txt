The claim is inaccurate because Case C003 explicitly shows the reverse order: *Validate_Payment* occurs at 10:43:00Z (Line 6), which is prior to *Receive_Order* at 10:45:00Z (Line 7). Furthermore, in Case C005, *Validate_Payment* appears on Line 11 without *Receive_Order* ever appearing in that specific trace, demonstrating that the activity does not strictly require *Receive_Order* as a predecessor in this specific log fragment.
