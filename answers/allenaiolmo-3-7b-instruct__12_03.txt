No

Justification:
The FACT claims that “Validate_Payment” always occurs immediately after “Receive_Order” with no other activities in between. This is not supported by the log. For example:

- Case C001: Receive_Order at 09:12 → Pack_Items at 10:00 (with Validate_Payment at 09:15, not immediately after Receive_Order).
- Case C002: Receive_Order at 09:30 → Pack_Items at 09:50 (Validate_Payment at 10:05, not immediate).
- Case C003: Receive_Order at 09:40 → Validate_Payment at 09:44 (but there is no Pack_Items between them, but Validate_Payment is not immediately after — there is no other activity in between in this case, but this is not the rule for all).
- More importantly, for C004: Receive_Order at 10:05 → Check_Fraud at 10:07 (another activity between the two), and later Validate_Payment at 10:20 (not immediate after Receive_Order).

Thus, the “immediately after with nothing in between” rule does not hold for all or even most cases.
