Let's analyze the event log line by line:

Each line is structured as:
<event case="..." concept:name="..." time:timestamp="..."/>

To answer the questions:

---

✅ Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?

We look at the values of the case attribute:
- C001
- C002
- C003

So, there are 3 distinct cases.

🅰️ Answer: 3

---

✅ Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).

Look for lines with case="C002":
- Line 2: Receive_Order (2025-03-01T09:15:10)
- Line 5: Check_Stock   (2025-03-01T09:22:55)
- Line 8: Arrange_Delivery (2025-03-01T10:15:20)
- Line 10: Ship_Order   (2025-03-01T10:25:40)

Sort by timestamp:
1. Receive_Order
2. Check_Stock
3. Arrange_Delivery
4. Ship_Order

🅰️ Answer: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

✅ Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

We look for “Ship_Order” events and their directly preceding event within the same case.

Let’s analyze each case:

- C001:
  - Sequence:
    1. Receive_Order (line 1)
    2. Check_Stock   (line 3)
    3. Ship_Order    (line 7)
  
  ⇒ Immediately before Ship_Order: Check_Stock

- C002:
  - Sequence:
    1. Receive_Order (line 2)
    2. Check_Stock   (line 5)
    3. Arrange_Delivery (line 8)
    4. Ship_Order    (line 10)
  
  ⇒ Immediately before Ship_Order: Arrange_Delivery

- C003:
  - Sequence:
    1. Receive_Order (line 4)
    2. Check_Stock   (line 6)
    3. Ship_Order    (line 9)

  ⇒ Immediately before Ship_Order: Check_Stock

Collecting all distinct preceding activities:
- Check_Stock
- Arrange_Delivery

Alphabetically:
- Arrange_Delivery
- Check_Stock

🅰️ Answer:

Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock

✅ Final Answers:

Q1: 3  
Q2: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
Q3:
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
