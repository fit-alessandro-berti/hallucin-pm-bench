The fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment.

Justification:
- In Case 1001, the sequence is: Inspect_Item -> Update_Inventory -> Authorize_Refund. Here, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund".
- In Case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not occur at all, so the sequence cannot be established.
- In Case 1003, the sequence is: Inspect_Item -> Update_Inventory -> Quality_Check -> Authorize_Refund. Again, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund".

Therefore, "Authorize_Refund" does not always occur immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case.
