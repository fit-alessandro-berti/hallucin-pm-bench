Three activities both breach their Target SLA and have the highest average waiting times among SLAâ€‘breaching steps: Legal Approval (900 s vs 600 s SLA, +300 s; waiting 600 s; 465 cases), Risk Review (600 s vs 300 s SLA, +300 s; waiting 480 s; 480 cases), and Credit Assessment (300 s vs 240 s SLA, +60 s; waiting 200 s; 1175 cases).

- Legal Approval: Introduce a priority queue at this step to reduce its 600 s average waiting by at least 300 s.
- Risk Review: Reserve dedicated processing windows so average waiting drops by at least 300 s from 480 s.
- Credit Assessment: Prioritize intake so average waiting falls by at least 60 s from 200 s.
