Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking.

A shortest firing sequence demonstrating this is:

T1, T4, T2b, T5

**Explanation:**

1.  **T1 Fires:** Starting from M0 = {p0: 1}, T1 is enabled. Firing T1 consumes the token from p0 and places tokens in pa and pb. The marking becomes {pa: 1, pb: 1}.
2.  **T4 Fires:** In {pa: 1, pb: 1}, T4 is enabled (requires pb). Firing T4 consumes the token from pb and places a token in pe. The marking becomes {pa: 1, pe: 1}. At this point, T3 is not enabled (requires pc, which is 0), and T5 is not enabled (requires pd, which is 0).
3.  **T2b Fires:** In {pa: 1, pe: 1}, T2b is enabled (requires pa). Firing T2b consumes the token from pa and places a token in pd. The marking becomes {pd: 1, pe: 1}. At this point:
    *   T5 is enabled (requires pd=1 and pe=1).
    *   T3 is *not* enabled (requires pc, which is 0).
4.  **T5 Fires:** In the marking {pd: 1, pe: 1}, T5 is enabled. We can fire T5. The sequence so far is T1, T4, T2b, T5.

In this sequence (T1, T4, T2b, T5), transition T3 does not appear at all. Thus, T5 fires before T3. This sequence has a length of 4. Any sequence enabling T5 requires firing T1, T4, and either T2b (1 step) or (T2, T3) (2 steps). The path via T2b is shorter to enable T5, requiring 3 steps (T1, T4, T2b) to reach a state where T5 is enabled. Firing T5 is the 4th step. Therefore, length 4 is the minimum length for a sequence that includes T5. Since the 'shortcut' T2b bypasses T3, it's possible to enable and fire T5 without ever enabling or firing T3.
