1.  The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs 1 time in the excerpt.

2.  a) Percentage of all *events* that include “Manual_Fraud_Check”:
    (1 event / 48 total events) * 100 = **2.08%**
    b) Percentage of all *unique cases* (12 in total) that include “Manual_Fraud_Check”:
    (1 case / 12 total cases) * 100 = **8.33%**

3.  A low-support activity like "Manual_Fraud_Check," appearing in only one of 12 cases (8.33%), can significantly mislead analyses if generalized from this small data slice. Its presence in a single case might skew average throughput times if this path is unusually long or short. Predictive models might incorrectly assign importance to this rare variant, leading to flawed predictions about future case behavior or resource needs. Generalizing from such limited occurrences risks misrepresenting the typical process flow and focusing on an outlier rather than common patterns.
