As a senior process-management consultant for AtlasRemit, I have translated the informal process description into a formal RACI matrix. 

In strict adherence to the mandated glossary, all legacy and restricted terms (such as "Payment Clerk," "Compliance Officer," and "Customer Due Diligence") have been replaced with the approved nomenclature. 

### **AtlasRemit Cross-Border Payment: RACI Matrix**

|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **1** | Receive transfer instruction and log it in the system | R, A | | |
| **2** | Screen payment against the sanctions list | R | A | |
| **3** | Perform **KYC Review** on both sender and beneficiary | | R, A | |
| **4** | Approve transaction (if flagged as high-risk) | I | R, A | |
| **5** | Release the approved payment | R, A | | I |

### **RACI Definitions Key**
* **R (Responsible):** The role that executes the task to ensure completion.
* **A (Accountable):** The role holding ultimate ownership and decision-making authority for the correct completion of the activity. *(Note: Where a distinct managing entity is absent from the process narrative, accountability is assigned to the functional domain expert).* 
* **C (Consulted):** The role(s) asked for input or expertise prior to task execution or finalization (none explicitly dictated in this process segment).
* **I (Informed):** The role(s) notified of a task's outcome or status, often acting as a trigger for their subsequent responsibilities.
