> **Key Verification**:  
> - *KYC/AML documents are excluded* (per note: outsourced to third party, not part of in-house process).  
> - *Scorecard inputs (Cyan/Magenta/Yellow) are data sources, not documents* (per process description: used internally in Step 3).  
> - *No other documents appear* (e.g., "Signed Offer Sheet 77" in Step 8 is a signed version of existing **Offer Sheet 77**, not a new document).
