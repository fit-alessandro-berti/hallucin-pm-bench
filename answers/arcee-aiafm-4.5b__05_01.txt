Add a Timer Boundary Event to the "Task_Check" task. Set its expression to continuously compare the current date/time against "48:00:00" (48 hours from claim submission time). If the check fails, redirect "Task_Triage" to an auto-escalation task using a new sequence flow with a condition expression checking for escalation.

Replace existing sequence flow from "Task_Check" to "Task_Triage" (id: f3) with this new flow. Add a Timer Boundary Event to "Task_Triage" with a similar expression, and create a new sequence flow from "Task_Assign" to this event, another new sequence flow to "Task_Notify", and a final flow to 'End'.

This maintains workflow continuity while adding a timer-based SLA enforcement mechanism.
