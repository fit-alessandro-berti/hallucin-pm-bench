**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**Subject:** Q1 Claims Handling Performance Analysis  

Our Q1 data reveals the "Document" phase is critically throttling process flow, dropping throughput from 270 to 190 cases daily.

**1. Request_Documents** (Primary Bottleneck)  
**Analysis:** This activity causes severe stagnation with a **150-minute average wait** and a **22% rework rate**. The high rework suggests unclear initial requirements, forcing repeated loops.  
**Recommendation:** Implement automated intake validation rules to ensure correct documentation is submitted immediately, reducing rework cycles.

**2. Review_Documents**  
**Analysis:** This step has the highest **SLA breach (12.4%)** and **processing time (25 min)**. The high **standard deviation (9 min)** indicates significant inconsistency in how agents assess files.  
**Recommendation:** Deploy standardized review templates or decision trees to stabilize execution times and reduce variability.

**3. Initial_Assessment**  
**Analysis:** While less critical than the document phase, this step exhibits the third-highest **wait time (18 min)** and **SLA breach (3.2%)**, signaling an upstream capacity constraint.  
**Recommendation:** Temporarily reallocate staff from the under-utilized downstream activities (e.g., *Pay_Claim*) to address this queue.
