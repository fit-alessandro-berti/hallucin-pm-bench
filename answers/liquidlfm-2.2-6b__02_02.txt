Let's answer each question step by step based on the provided XES event log fragment.

---

### Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?

**Answer:**  
There are **3** distinct cases listed in the log:  
- C001  
- C002  
- C003  

---

### Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).

**Sequence:**  
C002 → Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

---

### Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

First, identify all events that immediately occur before "Ship_Order":

- For C001:
  - No event precedes C001 Ship_Order as it is the first event for C001.

- For C002:
  - The events before C002 Ship_Order: C002 Receive_Order (09:15:10) and C002 Check_Stock (09:22:55)  
    But only C002 Check_Stock precedes Ship_Order (since Ship_Order happens at 10:05:10 for C002, and Check_Stock was at 09:22:55)  
    Correct sequence for C002: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → **Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**  
    So, prior activity to Ship_Order: Arrange_Delivery

- For C003:
  - Events: C003 Receive_Order (09:21:30), C003 Check_Stock (09:25:05), **C003 Ship_Order (10:20:30)**  
    There's no Ship_Order event for C002 before another case's Ship_Order in the direct timeline for C002. For C003, Ship_Order isn’t immediately before another Ship_Order in sequence.

Alphabetically ordered distinct immediate predecessors before Ship_Order:

- **Arrange_Delivery**

### Final Answers:

**Q1:** 3 distinct cases  
**Q2:** C002 → Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
**Q3:**  
Arrange_Delivery
