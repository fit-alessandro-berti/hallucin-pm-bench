1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **exactly once** in this fragment.

2. Total number of logged events = 18  
   Number of “Manual_Fraud_Check” events = 1  
   Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ **5.56%**

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is: **A1002**

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of monthly frequency of manual fraud checks based on this fragment is unreliable:  
   - **Temporal bias**: The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01), which may not represent typical monthly patterns (e.g., weekday vs. weekend, holiday effects, or seasonal trends).  
   - **Selection bias**: The log fragment contains only four cases (A1001–A1004), which is a very small and potentially non-random sample. It may not reflect the true distribution of fraud checks across all cases, especially if Manual_Fraud_Check is triggered by specific, rare conditions not captured here.
