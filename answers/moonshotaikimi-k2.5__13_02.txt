With only one occurrence (2.08 % of events, 8.33 % of cases), **Manual_Fraud_Check** represents an exceptional path. Generalising from this slice risks treating it as noise—causing analysts to overlook a critical compliance step—or conversely, overfitting models to a single instance. Performance averages (e.g., cycle time) will hide this variant’s true impact, while predictive models may discard the feature due to low support, missing fraud‑risk indicators, or assign spurious correlation. This sampling bias yields fragile process insights that fail to capture actual operational complexity when the full log contains more manual checks.
