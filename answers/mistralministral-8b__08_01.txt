Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in this Petri net. Below is a concrete firing sequence from the initial marking that demonstrates this:

1. **Initial Marking**: p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

2. **T1 Fires**: Transition T1 is enabled because p0 has a token. Firing T1 removes one token from p0 and adds tokens to p1 and p2.
   - Marking after T1: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

3. **T5 Fires**: Transition T5 is enabled because p3 has a token and p4 has zero tokens. Firing T5 removes one token from p3 and adds one token to p6.
   - Marking after T5: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1)

4. **T3 Fires**: Transition T3 is enabled because p2 has a token. Firing T3 removes one token from p2 and adds one token to p4.
   - Marking after T3: p0(0), p1(1), p2(0), p3(0), p4(1), p5(0), p6(1)

This sequence shows that T5 can fire before T3.

### Justification:
- **T1** is always enabled initially because p0 has a token.
- **T5** is enabled after T1 because it only requires p3 to have a token and p4 to have zero tokens. This condition is met immediately after T1 fires.
- **T3** is enabled only after T5 has fired because T3 requires p2 to have a token, and p2 has a token only after T1 fires.

Therefore, T5 can fire before T3 in this Petri net.
