**Cannot be derived**

**Explanation:** The event log provided contains only case IDs, activity names, and resource names; the timestamps and elapsed‑time fields have been redacted. Without start or end times for each “Review Contract” occurrence, it is impossible to calculate its cycle time. Additionally, the historical benchmark does not include an average duration for “Review Contract,” so no external reference can be used. Consequently, the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be determined from the available data.
