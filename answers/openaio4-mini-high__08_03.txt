Yes – because of the “shortcut” T2b you can avoid ever firing T3 and still get a token in pd.  In fact the shortest run that fires T5 before any T3 is of length 4.  For example:

  1) T1  (p0→pa,pb)  
  2) T2b (pa→pd)  
  3) T4  (pb→pe)  
  4) T5  (pd,pe→pf)  

At step 4 you fire T5, and T3 has never been used.
