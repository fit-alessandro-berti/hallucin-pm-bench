**No**

**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1**: Violated. The order of QE and RA is incorrect: QE occurs first (✓), but RA occurs **after** `Notify_Authorities`, which is allowed — however, the rule *only* requires that both occur once each and **in that order**, so this part is actually satisfied (QE → RA). So Rule 1 is *not* violated.  
- **Rule 2**: Violated. For `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` must occur **after both QE and RA**. In the trace:  
  - QE occurs  
  - RA occurs later (after NA)  
  - VP occurs *after RA* — so this requirement is met. So Rule 2 is *not* violated.  
- **Rule 3**: **Violated** — `Notify_Authorities` occurs *before* RA is complete. Rule 3 states: “`Notify_Authorities` must **not occur until after** QE **and** RA are complete.”  
  Here, `Notify_Authorities` happens *between* QE and RA — RA hasn’t occurred yet at the time of NA → **violation**.  
- **Rule 4**: Since NA occurs prematurely, CC (which depends on NA and possibly VP) is also placed after a non-compliant NA — but the core violation is Rule 3.

✅ Compliance check:  
- QE and RA each occur once, and in correct order (QE → RA) — **Rule 1 satisfied**  
- VP occurs after both QE and RA — **Rule 2 satisfied**  
- ❌ NA occurs before RA is complete — **Rule 3 violated**  
- Rule 4 is irrelevant in isolation here because Rule 3 is already violated.

**Final answer: No** — due to premature `Notify_Authorities` before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
