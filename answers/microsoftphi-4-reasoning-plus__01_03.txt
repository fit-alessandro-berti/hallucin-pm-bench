We are Phiexpert on Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process. Requirements:

User asked: a) Summarise every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process, describing its rule in one sentence each, b) list all documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear.

Let's re-read instructions: "System: You are an expert on Acme Bank’s SMALL-BUSINESS loan-approval process, defined exactly as follows." with a process description given.

The process steps are provided:

Process description from the user provided text, which includes steps and decision branches:

1. Receive-Application   Document: Form 14B  
2. Assign-Deck-Reviewer (role: Deck Officer)  
3. Tri-Color-Risk-Check  
   - Inputs: Scorecard-Cyan, Scorecard-Magenta, Scorecard-Yellow  
   - Outcome = {Low, Medium, High} risk rating  
4. - If (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ €250 000)  
   skip step 5.  
5. Manual-Underwriting-Review   Document: Deck Memo  
6. Decision-Gate “TriVote” — requires approvals from all three:  
  - roles: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer  
  - decision rule: any two approvals out of three suffice to pass.  
7. Prepare-Binding-Offer   Document: Offer Sheet 77  
8. Request-Applicant-Confirmation   Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration  
9. Finalize-Agreement   Document: Loan Dossier 2025

And additional details: 
- KYC/AML checks are not performed here; they are outsourced.
- Sustainability Officer participation is mandatory.
- No credit-bureau pull occurs outside Tri-Color-Risk-Check.

User question: a) "Summarise every decision point (gate or conditional branch) in Acme's process, describing its rule in one sentence each" so we have two types of decision points: one is "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" (which is a decision point, but condition check? Actually step 3 is tri-color risk check and then step 4 as conditional branch: if risk is Low or Medium and requested amount <= 250k then step 5 is skipped) then step 6 Decision gate "TriVote" as step 6. Also possibly more decision points possibly. Check Process Description.

Let's list decision points in order in the process: They are the following:

1. Step 3 "Tri-Color-Risk-Check": It determines risk rating based on three inputs; it's a decision point. Explanation: "Determines risk, outputting one of {Low, Medium, High}" is a decision point.

However, instructions ask: Summarize every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch) in process, describing its rule in a sentence. Let us have two decision points:

- The "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" employing three scorecards and coming out with risk classification isn't perhaps a conditional decision per se? It is perhaps the "risk rating" step. But the instruction "decision point" may include any branch or gate, so it is:

(1) At step 3, Tri-Color-Risk-Check: Determines risk rating based on inputs. But does the process phrase this as decision point? Well, it's not truly a conditional branch, it's a step that produces risk outcome. But it's a decision point since it sets conditions for subsequent step to be skipped or not.

- Alternatively, step 3 is not a decision gate per se. But step 4 has a conditional branch: "If (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ 250,000) skip step 5". This is a conditional branch that says if those conditions are met, skip underwriting review. But wait, process steps: that said for risk outcomes in {Low, Medium} if requested amount is also <= €250,000, then step 5 is skipped. But note, what if risk is Low or Medium but requested-amount more than 250k? Then manual underwriting review is required. Actually, check the condition carefully: "If (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ €250 000) skip step 5" which means if these conditions are met, step 5 (Manual Underwriting) is not performed. So if risk is high, or if risk is low/medium and requested-amount > 250k. So condition optionally bypasses manual underwriting review if the risk and requested amount qualifies.

So that is decision point 1: Conditions in step 4. This says: "If both risk level is low or medium AND the requested amount is €250k or less, then manual underwriting is skipped."

Then next, step 6 Decision gate "TriVote": it requires any two of approvals required out of three signatures; it's a decision point where if two out of the three (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve, then the loan moves on to prepare binding offer; if not, presumably the process halts (although process description says any two suffice to pass). So so rule: "Approvals from any two out of the three key stakeholders (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) are enough to decide loan approval in the Decision Gate."

Are there additional decision points? Let me re-read process carefully to see if there are any other branches:
- Step 4 is a conditional branch "if risk in {Low, Medium} and amount <= €250k then skip step 5". That's one.
- Step 6 is a Decision gate and it's not exactly conditioned on a branch, but it is a decision point where you wait for approval from two of three signatures. But maybe we should count it as a decision point.
- There's no other decision point.

We might also note that the process contains a branch if request-amount > €250k, or if risk = high, then you always perform the manual underwriting review and step 5.

Wait further: "Prepare-Binding-Offer" occurs after the approval gate. That is a step that is not "decision point" but part of the step. So documents: Not required specifically. But question part b: "List all documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear." So we need to list each document and note the order of appearance:
- Step 1: Document: Form 14B appears "Receive-Application" (the first doc).
- "Deck Memo" appears in step 5 manually "Manual-Underwriting-Review" (but may not be used if it is skip).
- Step 7: Document: "Offer Sheet 77" appears "Prepare-Binding-Offer."
- Step 8: Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, and ID Matrix Declaration appear.
- Step 9: Document: "Loan Dossier 2025" appears in "Finalize-Agreement."

So all required documents in order of first appearance:
1. Form 14B
2. Deck Memo (sole needed if manual underwriting required) but in a process note that if risk condition doesn't require manual underwriting review then deck memo is not necessary. But question says "documents required anywhere in the process." The instruction says "List all documents that are required anywhere in the process" it might be "the documents required" must include "Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025" in that order.

But let’s check: step 1 uses "Form 14B." Step 2 not required, step 3 no additional but then check step 4: skip Step 5 if condition. But if not skip, then step 5 is mandatory (document: Deck Memo) so it's required. So that means if not skip, then they require Deck Memo. Next, step 8, for applicant confirmation: Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, and ID Matrix Declaration must be provided. And then Step 9: "Loan Dossier 2025."

Now question part says "required anywhere in the process (in the order they first appear)". The process step order: ideally sum them up in order of process rather than order of steps, yes. So we should list "Form 14B" (appears in step 1), "Deck Memo" (appears in step 5, but not if conditional branch says in some cases skip, but it does appear as a document required in that case, then "Offer Sheet 77" (appears in step 7 and then in step 8, but already accepted document), and then "ID Matrix Declaration" (appears in step 8), and then "Loan Dossier 2025" (appears in step 9). But check: is "Offer Sheet 77" already used in both step 7 and step 8? But anyway, it's identical, only one mention needed because it first appears in Step 7. But maybe include it as a separate document in the final list, with note that it must be signed before step 8. But in part b, they want all documents that are "required anywhere in the process."

So answer for part a: Summarize the decision points. Which are:

1. Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check): "Generates the risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) from three scorecards, thereby influencing subsequent processing." More descriptive: "If the risk rating from Scorecard-Cyan, Scorecard-Magenta, and Scorecard-Yellow falls into Low or Medium categories, the process may subsequently bypass the Manual-Underwriting-Review if the requested amount is at most €250K."
Wait, then we need to mention condition in detail.

The given description says: if (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ €250 000) then skip step 5. This is the conditional branch in step 4. So answer: "If risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is €250,000 or below, the process omits the manual underwriting review, making that step unnecessary." That is one decision point.

2. Step 6: "Decision-Gate TriVote" where "Approval is given if any two out of three key participants (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) sign off, meaning that at least two approvals are required to proceed."

So yes, that's it.

Now we probably need to also mention that the manual underwriting route is conditional on that decision.

I think we just list two decision points?

Wait, Step 3 is the "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" itself. It's a step that "evaluates the risk using scorecards." That is a decision point in the process, as that output, meaning it takes a decision and then based on that, the next steps are either opting to skip or not skip certain process steps if they match the condition in step 4 (which sets the decision whether to skip manual underwriting review).
But it's not exactly a gate but rather a "Risk decision" step which uses conditional branching in step 4. It might not be a branch though, it's simply a rating. However, step 4 is a branch because it says: "if X then skip Step 5."

I can include a description for each such branch. Summaries might be:

a) Decision points.

- The Tri-Color-Risk-Check (Step 3) generates a risk rating from three risk scorecards: if the outcome falls into Low or Medium categories and the requested amount is €250,000 or less, then the subsequent manual underwriting review (Step 5) is bypassed.
Or "It serves as a risk rating decision point using Scorecard-Cyan, Scorecard-Magenta, and Scorecard-Yellow to classify the risk as Low, Medium, or High."

But careful: original description states: Step 3 is "Tri-Color-Risk-Check 
   • Inputs: Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, Scorecard–Yellow 
   • Outcome = {Low, Medium, High} risk rating." It is not described as a conditional branch. It is a check. The condition branch is explicitly given in step 4: "If (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ €250 000) then skip step 5."

- The second decision point is Step 6, "TriVote." It is a decision gate that requires approval from any two out of the three stakeholders (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) to pass. So, "Any two of three stakeholder approvals (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) warrants progression to preparing a binding offer."

I have to meticulously produce one-sentence summary for each.

I think I'll say: "At the Tri-Color-Risk-Check decision point, the system generates a risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) from three provided scorecards, determining whether a manual review is needed." That's one sentence.

Then for the second decision point: "if the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is €250,000 or less, then manual underwriting is skipped" is also a decision point or branch.

Maybe I'll combine them: "At the conditional branch after risk-check, the process bypasses Manual Underwriting-Review if the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is at most €250,000." However, we have these steps:

Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check (it is a check but I think it's a decision point because it sets conditions for program branching, although it's not a branch but it is used to feed into branch condition). So I'll list:
(1) The risk rating decision from Step 3 impacts which steps proceed.
(2) The conditional branch at Step 4 determines whether Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5) is skipped (if conditions met) or executed (if not met).
(3) The underwriting approval gate at Step 6, i.e. TriVote, then decides whether to proceed if at least two out of the three required roles approve.

I think I'll list these three decision points separately:
- Decision point describing how the risk rating is assigned using the scorecards (Step 3).
- Conditional branch at Step 4: "if risk in {Low, Medium} and requested-amount is €250k or less, then step 5 is skipped, meaning manual review is not required."
- Underwriting decision gate at Step 6: "TriVote requires a majority (2 out of 3) of approvals from Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer to proceed."

So I'll produce a list with sentence: 
"Q: Summarise every decision point (gate or conditional branch) in Acme bank’s process."

I'll produce answers ( potentially bullet list with two items if one is considered enough, but I'll check instructions precisely: "Summarise every decision point in Acme's process describing its rule in one sentence each." "Decision point" can be interpreted as a branching point or a gate. There are two main ones: (a) The branch in Step 4; (b) The TriVote step 6. And possibly Tri-Color Risk Check is not exactly a decision point but it's data used for decision. 

But then, do we also include the outcome? Alternatively, it might be that we include both the branch condition and the approval gate as decision points explicitly.

Alternatively, maybe they want to list "all" the decision points which are: 
(1) The Tri-Color-Risk-Check decision: Determines risk from multiple scorecards leading directly to whether manual review is needed.
(2) The conditional branch in Step 4: if risk is Low/Medium and requested amount is low, it bypasses the manual review; else, it doesn't.
(3) The Decision Gate (TriVote) in Step 6: where two out of three required approvals are needed to pass the loan.

Thus answer for part (a) are three decision points? But wait, what is "Manual-Underwriting-Review" not a decision point.

Alternatively, maybe we should state them in order:
- The first decision is the Tri-Color-Risk-Check that outputs a risk rating from the three scorecards.
- Next, the conditional skip is triggered based on risk rating and requested amount; if risk is either Low or Medium and the amount is ≤ €250k, skip the manual underwriting review.
- The second major decision element: the TriVote decision gate requiring at least 2 out of the 3 required individuals (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) to approve.

Thus I'll produce a list of three summarizing each in one sentence:

First: "The Tri-Color-Risk-Check assigns a risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) based on the outcomes of the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow scorecards, which informs subsequent decision-making." 
That isn't especially different from "a risk rating decision point", but I might want to mention it separately if we treat it as a decision point because it's a process decision. But also the process I think decision points are usually where decisions are made to follow down one branch or another.

Let me check the exact wording: "decision point (gate or conditional branch)." TriColor-Risk-Check is not exactly a gate as it does not branch decision: It is an evaluation of risk that then feeds into the branch condition. 
The branch condition is: "if (risk in {Low, Medium} and requested amount <= €250,000 then skip step 5)" so that's a conditional branch. And later the Approval Gate, which is a decision gate, is a second branch.

Let's re-read process steps:
Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check. So outcome: risk rating. That itself is not a "conditional branch" but it's the basis for a "conditional branch" at 4. Actually, sometimes there is explicit gate at which decisions are taken. I think that's not counted as a "decision point" if it's not a decision by itself, but rather it's a function evaluation that feeds into a conditional branch. So I might say: "Based on the risk rating, step 4 determines whether or not manual underwriting review is required."

Alternatively, I can combine step 3 and step 4 into one sentence: "The Decision Point regarding risk assessment: if the combination of the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow scorecards yields a risk rating of Low or Medium and the requested amount is below or equal to €250K, then the process bypasses the manual underwriting review."

But the process description has step 3 and step 4 separately. If I split them, then: "Decision Point 1: The Tri-Color-Risk-Check provides a risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) using three scorecard evaluations." Decision Point 2: "If the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested amount is €250,000 or less, then the process skips the manual underwriting review (Step 5) to expedite processing." And Decision Point 3: "The TriVote Decision Gate requires that at least two out of the three required approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) sign off, otherwise the process does not proceed past binding offer stage."

However, the wording "every decision point" might only include decision branches that decide a variation in the process, not step that collects inputs. Typically, decision points are either conditional branches or voting gates. So I'd consider both the conditional branch at Step 4 and the decision gate at Step 6 qualifies. Additionally, maybe consider the risk check, because it's also a step where outcome is decided and has consequence. Likely they want the Tri-Color-Risk-Check to be highlighted as a decision point because it uses automated scoring to yield a risk classification that then determines branch outcomes.

Optimally, I'll include step 3's purpose: it gives a risk rating based on three scorecards; then conditionally, if risk rating is low to medium and the requested amount is not above the threshold, step 5 is skipped.

Let's produce one sentence per decision point in an enumerated list:

- Decision Point A (Tri-Color-Risk-Check): "Using the outcomes of three credit scorecards — Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow — the process assigns the applicant a risk rating of Low, Medium, or High, which influences whether manual underwriting review is required."

- Decision Point B (Conditional Skip for Manual-Underwriting): "If the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, the process immediately bypasses the Manual-Underwriting-Review (step 5), streamlining the approval."

- Decision Point C (TriVote Decision Gate): "The loan approval contingent Decision Gate, TriVote, mandates at least two approvals out of three from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer—a majority vote—to allow the process to continue to the binding offer preparation."

These are three sentence one. That should be answer part (a).

Now part (b): "List all documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear." Order: The process list as provided is:

Step 1: Form 14B is received when an application is submitted. 
Step 5: (If not skipped) Deck Memo is used in the Manual Underwriting Review. It must be part of the process if it is triggered. But it is required only in that branch: "if risk condition is high or requested amount above threshold then manual underwriting review is needed, requiring Deck Memo." So it appears in the process if applicable. But since the question says "anywhere in the process", it is required - it's a conditional requirement in one branch. But since the process is defined as given, then we include it in the list.

Then step 7: Offer Sheet 77 is used in Prepare-Binding-Offer.
Then step 8: There's a document required that includes Signed Offer Sheet 77 and also the ID Matrix Declaration is also required.
Step 9: Loan Dossier 2025 is distributed for Finalize-Agreement documentation.

Therefore, list, in the order they first appear: Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025. 
I must list all documents required anywhere. Some appear obviously in different steps and maybe step 7 yields Offer Sheet 77 but step 8 requires signed Offer Sheet 77. But the first mention is "Offer Sheet 77" in step 7, then in step 8 it is repeated but requirement is to sign. The requirement is identical. So only need list it once. But strictly, the "order they first appear" means we consider steps in order: first document is Form 14B; next, if triggered, Deck Memo; then next is Offer Sheet 77; then ID Matrix Declaration (Note that ID Matrix Declaration doesn't appear in step 7 but first appears in step 8 as one of the submission documents, though earlier, the ID matrix is used in step 1? Actually check: "Request-Applicant-Confirmation" step includes: "Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration." So the ID Matrix Declaration is required then. Finally Loan Dossier 2025.

However, note that "Form 14B" is received at application submission; "Deck Memo" occurs in manual underwriting review. But what if the risk condition is met to skip manual underwriting review? But the question says "all documents required anywhere" so I include all standard documents in the process. So answer: Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025.

We need to list them in order they first appear in the process: 
Name them in the given order (by step number):
- Step 1: Form 14B.
- Step 5: Deck Memo (conditional document, but needed in that branch)
- Step 7: Offer Sheet 77.
- Step 8: ID Matrix Declaration (given as one of the two documents)
- Step 9: Loan Dossier 2025.

Thus answer for part (b) is: Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, and Loan Dossier 2025. (Even if the document Offer Sheet 77 appears in step 7 and then repeated in step 8 we only mention it once in list in the order if it's the first time it appears.)

That's straightforward.

I must produce final answer that is plain text without markdown formatting unless desired. Possibly I'll use bullet or numbering in text, but by default, we can do it plain text with newlines, but instructions say "one sentence each" for decision points.

I'll produce answer text accordingly.

I'll produce the answer in plain text, no markdown formatting. I'll produce text: part (a) and part (b).

I'll produce answer with the list formatting with bullet points or numbers, but instructions do not require markdown formatting. But instructions say "By default, do not use markdown formatting unless requested." But earlier instructions say: "By default, do not reply with markdown formatting unless requested." But we need to check instructions: "By default, do not reply with markdown formatting unless requested." Actually instructions: "You are an expert on Acme Bank's system. You might produce text."

Maybe I'll produce answer as plain text bullet list.

I'll produce final answer like:

Answer for part (a):
1. Decision point in Step 3: The Tri-Color-Risk-Check evaluates the risk rating based on three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), thereby dictating whether further manual review is needed.
2. Decision point in Step 4: If the risk rating is Low or Medium and the requested-amount is €250,000 or less, the process skips Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5).
3. Decision point in Step 6: The TriVote decision gate requires that at least two out of three key approvals (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) are obtained to advance the loan process.

That is basically what I said before.

For part (b), answer: The required documents in order of appearance are: 
a) Form 14B (Received during application submission).
b) Deck Memo (used in Manual Underwriting Review if performed).
c) Offer Sheet 77 (prepared in binding offer phase).
d) ID Matrix Declaration (required during applicant confirmation).
e) Loan Dossier 2025 (finalized agreement document).

I can produce answer as a numbered list.

I can produce answer in plain text formatted as items.

I'll produce answer.Below is the answer broken into two parts:

─────────────────────────────  
(a) Decision Points

1. The Tri‐Color‐Risk‐Check (Step 3) uses three inputs—the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow scorecards—to assign a risk rating (Low, Medium, or High), which then governs whether further manual review is needed.
2. The Conditional Branch (Step 4) decrees that if the assigned risk is Low or Medium and the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, then the subsequent Manual Underwriting Review (Step 5) is bypassed.
3. The TriVote Decision Gate (Step 6) requires that at least two out of three designated approvers—the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer—approve, so that only a majority of the three “votes” is needed to progress beyond this point.

─────────────────────────────  
(b) Required Documents (in order of first appearance)

1. Form 14B (received during application submission in Step 1).
2. Deck Memo (used for Manual Underwriting-Review in Step 5 if not skipped).
3. Offer Sheet 77 (prepared as part of the binding offer in Step 7).
4. ID Matrix Declaration (submitted alongside the signed Offer Sheet 77 during Applicant Confirmation in Step 8).
5. Loan Dossier 2025 (finalized at the end, in Step 9).

This completes the summary of Acme Bank’s loan‐approval decision points and documentation order.
