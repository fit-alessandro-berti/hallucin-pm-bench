No.

- **Case 1001:** `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund` (`... Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund ...`), so `Authorize_Refund` is not immediately before `Update_Inventory`.
- **Case 1003:** `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund`, and there is an intermediate step (`... Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund`), so it is not immediately before.
- **Case 1002:** there is **no** `Update_Inventory` event at all, so it cannot support an “always immediately before” relationship.
