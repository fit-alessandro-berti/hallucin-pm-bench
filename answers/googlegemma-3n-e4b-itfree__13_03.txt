1️⃣ The activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **twice** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst examining only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks. The excerpt contains only a few cases. In these cases, 'Manual Fraud Check' appears twice out of three cases where a fraud check is performed. This suggests a relatively high frequency. However, the full month-long log might show a different distribution. There could be periods with significantly more or fewer manual checks due to varying loan application volumes, risk thresholds, or staffing levels. Without the complete dataset, the observed frequency might not be representative of the overall trend.
