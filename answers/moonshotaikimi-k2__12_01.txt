No – the stated fact is not accurate.

- Case 1001: after “Inspect_Item” we see `Update_Inventory` followed by `Authorize_Refund`, not the reverse order.  
- Case 1002: no `Update_Inventory` is recorded at all.  
- Case 1003: again `Update_Inventory` precedes `Authorize_Refund`, with `Quality_Check` in between.

Thus, in the available data, “Authorize_Refund” never occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory”.
