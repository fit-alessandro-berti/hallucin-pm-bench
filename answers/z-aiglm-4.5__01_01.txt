Based **strictly** on the provided Contoso Airlines flight-refund process description, here is the summary:

### **Decision Points**
1.  **High-value claim assessment**: After **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**, the process checks if the refund amount is **greater than €1 000**.
    *   If **YES**, the case proceeds to **Senior_Auditor_Review**.
    *   If **NO**, the case skips **Senior_Auditor_Review** and proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment** (once prerequisites are met).

*Note: This is the **only explicit decision point** causing branching in the described process. Steps like Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility and Finance_Controller_PreApprove involve validation/approval but are presented as mandatory activities without stated branching outcomes based on their results.*

### **Required Documents**
1.  **RefundRequestForm**: Submitted by the customer during **Customer_Submit_Claim**.
2.  **FlightManifest**: Referenced by the triage agent during **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**.
3.  **WeatherReport**: Referenced by the triage agent during **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**.
4.  **EligibilityChecklist**: Used by the finance controller during **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**.
5.  **AuditTrail**: **Required** for the **Senior_Auditor_Review** activity (triggered only for claims > €1 000).
6.  **BankTransferAuthorization**: **Required** for the **Process_Refund_Payment** activity to begin.
7.  **RefundConfirmationPDF**: Generated and sent by the system during **Issue_Confirmation_Letter**.
