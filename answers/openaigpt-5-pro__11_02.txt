Based on Q1-2025 data, the three worst-performing activities are:

- Request_Documents: Worst bottleneck. Why: longest queue (150 min), highest rework (22%), and sharp throughput drop (270 to 190); SLA breaches 5.5%. Action: Enforce upfront completeness checks via an auto-generated checklist before cases enter the queue; target rework <= 10% and average wait <= 60 min next quarter.

- Review_Documents: Quality/effort heavy. Why: longest processing (25 min) with highest variability (stdev 9) drives the worst SLA breach rate (12.4%). Action: Implement a standardized review checklist with clear acceptance criteria; target average processing <= 18 min, stdev <= 5, SLA breach <= 5%.

- Initial_Assessment: Early friction point. Why: elevated wait (18 min) and long processing (12 min) versus peers; SLA breaches 3.2% (third highest). Action: Pre-populate assessment fields from Register_Claim to cut handling; target processing <= 8 min and SLA breach <= 2%.

These actions address the primary bottlenecks and SLA risk.
