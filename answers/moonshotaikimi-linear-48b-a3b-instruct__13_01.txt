We have a log with 18 lines: each line is a case, timestamp, activity.

Case A1001: timeline: Receive_Order (09:00), Validate_Payment (09:15), Pack_Items (09:30), Ship_Order (10:00). No Manual_Fraud_Check.

Case A1002: Receive_Order (10:05), Validate_Payment (10:25), Manual_Fraud_Check (10:50), Pack_Items (11:10), Ship_Order (11:30). So one Manual_Fraud_Check.

Case A1003: Receive_Order (11:35), Validate_Payment (11:55), Pack_Items (12:15), Ship_Order (12:40), Customer_Feedback (13:00). No Manual_Fraud_Check.

Case A1004: Receive_Order (13:05), Validate_Payment (13:25), Pack_Items (13:45), Ship_Order (14:05). No Manual_Fraud_Check.

Thus, total events = 18 lines. Number of Manual_Fraud_Check events = 1.

Answer for #1: 1.

#2: What percentage of all logged events does this represent? Round to two decimal places. Number of all events = 18. So percentage = (1/18)*100 = 5.555...% ~ 5.56% (to two decimal places). So answer: 5.56% (approx). Typically rounding to two decimal places: 5.56%.

#3: List case identifiers that contain Manual_Fraud_Check. The case A1002 appears. So answer: A1002.

#4: Data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.

We need to think about sampling issues: The fragment includes only a few cases (4 cases), each with only one event per case, but only one case has Manual_Fraud_Check. The sample size is small, leading to high variance and low reliability. Also, the sample may not be representative of the whole month (selection bias). Also, the sample likely excludes events that occur after the observed period (i.e., no data for the rest of the month). Also, the sampling is not random; it's only a single month, and perhaps only certain days. Also, the sample may be a snapshot of only a few cases, not enough to estimate monthly frequency. Also, the event is rare (only 1 out of 18). So the estimate is unreliable because of small sample size (insufficient data), possible temporal variation, and lack of representation. Also, the method may not account for autocorrelation, etc.

Thus answer: The sample is too small to estimate monthly frequency reliably; it may not be representative of the full month; there is no information on months beyond the observed period.

Thus answer #4: Two sampling-related reasons: (1) Sample size is small (only 4 cases) leading to high variance; (2) The sample is not representative of the entire month (e.g., missing other cases or time periods) causing bias.

Alternatively: (1) The sample is not random and may be biased; (2) The sample size is too small to provide a stable estimate.

Thus answer accordingly.

Now provide the final answer.

**1.**  ***Manual_Fraud_Check*** appears **1** time in the fragment.

**2.**  It accounts for  
\[
\frac{1}{18}\times100 = 5.555\ldots\%
\]  
Rounded to two decimal places: **5.56 %**.

**3.**  The only case identifier that records “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

**4.**  Two sampling‑related reasons the estimate is unreliable:

1. **Too small a sample:** Only one of the four cases (A1002) contains the event, so the estimate is based on a single observation – the variance would be extremely high.
2. **Not representative of the full month:** The fragment captures only a few cases (and only one occurrence of the event). Unless these cases are known to be typical for the whole month, the sample may be biased, omitted other cases or time periods, and therefore cannot accurately reflect the true monthly frequency.
