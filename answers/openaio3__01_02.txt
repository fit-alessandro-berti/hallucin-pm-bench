Decision points in the Micro-loan Fast-Track flow  

1. Quick KYC Verification (KYC)  
   – Decision: ID card + mobile phone confirmed? If “yes,” continue; if “no,” stop the file.  

2. Underwriter Alignment Gate  
   – Decision: Do Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B risk scores differ by ≤ 2 points?  
     • “Yes” → move on to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC).  
     • “No”  → escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break, then return to the main flow.  

3. Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)  
   – Decision: Have ≥ 3 local references been gathered and accepted? If “yes,” continue; if “no,” hold or close the file.  

4. Amount Threshold Decision  
   – Decision: Is the requested amount < €15 000?  
     • “Yes” → system auto-approves and jumps to Disburse Funds.  
     • “No”  → proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).  

5. Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)  
   – Decision: Board vote “approve” or “reject.” “Approve” leads to Disburse Funds; “reject” closes the application.
