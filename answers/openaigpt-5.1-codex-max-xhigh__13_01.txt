1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs **1** time in this fragment.
2. It represents **5.56%** of all logged events (1 out of 18 events).
3. Case(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”: **A1002**.
4. Two sampling-related reasons the monthly estimate is unreliable:
   - The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01) and just 4 cases (18 events), so the sample is too small and temporally narrow to represent a full month.
   - The cases are not a random sample of the month; without broader, randomly selected data across days, the frequency observed here may not generalize.
