### Key:  
- **R = Responsible** (Performs the activity)  
- **A = Accountable** (Approves/validates completion)  
- *C = Consulted* (Not used in this process)  
- *I = Informed* (Not used in this process)  

### Notes:  
- **Terminology Compliance**:  
  - "KYC Review" replaces legacy term "Customer Due Diligence".  
  - "Order Vetting" replaces legacy term "Order Validation".  
  - "Payment Clearance" replaces legacy term "Payment Processing".  
- **Role Assignments**: Aligns exactly with process description. No consultations/informed roles required per documented workflow.  
- **Accountability**: Each activity has exactly one **A** (Accountable) role, per RACI best practices.
