I cannot compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity "Approve Invoice", its standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval. The provided event log stub only contains the column headers. Without the actual event data, specifically the start and complete timestamps for "Approve Invoice" events, the cycle time calculations are impossible.
