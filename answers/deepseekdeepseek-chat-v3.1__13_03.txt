1. The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **once** in this excerpt (CaseID 1002).

2. An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate frequency due to the limited timeframe. This excerpt captures only a small portion of the full month's data, which may include periods of higher or lower volumes of applications. The sample size is too small to identify any patterns, trends, or the true ratio of manual to automatic checks. Furthermore, it shows only a single type of manual check, potentially missing variations in activity names (e.g., "Manual Review") that could represent the same type of process step.
