To enforce the 48-hour SLA, add an **intermediate catch timer event** after the `Start_Claim` event, set to trigger after 48 hours. Split the flow at `Start_Claim` using a **parallel gateway**, creating two branches: one for the existing process (`f1` â†’ `Task_Receive`), and another to the timer event. If the timer triggers before the process reaches `Task_Triage`, route to an escalation end event (e.g., `End_SLAEscalated`). Reconnect the parallel flows after `Task_Triage` using a **parallel gateway**. If the `Task_Triage` completes first, the timer branch is canceled, ensuring SLA compliance. No new tasks are added; existing flows and gateways are modified.
