1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time (Case 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst may misestimate the frequency for three reasons based on this data:
*   **Small Sample Size:** Three cases are statistically insufficient to represent a full month.
*   **Naming Inconsistency:** The data shows inconsistent labeling for similar tasks (e.g., “Automatic Fraud Check” vs. “Fraud Check (Automatic)”). Other manual checks might exist under different labels not captured by an exact string search.
*   **Data Noise/Duplicates:** Cases 1001 and 1003 contain duplicate activity logs for “Send Offer” and “Approve Application.” If an analyst calculates the frequency of manual checks as a percentage of total events, these duplicates will artificially deflate the manual check ratio.
