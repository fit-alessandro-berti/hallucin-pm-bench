Below is the requested RACI Matrix, strictly applying your prescribed naming conventions and vocabulary:

### RACI Matrix: FinCo Order-to-Cash Workflow

| Activity             | AM | CO | FC | IT |
|----------------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Receive Application  |  R |  - |  - |  - |
| KYC Review           |  - |  R |  - |  - |
| Order Vetting        |  R |  - |  - |  - |
| Payment Clearance    |  - |  - |  R |  - |
| Record Update        |  - |  - |  - |  R |
| Notify Customer      |  R |  - |  - |  - |

### Legend:
- **R** = Responsible (the role performing the activity)
- **A** = Accountable (ensures activity completion; not explicitly defined above)
- **C** = Consulted (input required; not explicitly listed above)
- **I** = Informed (not explicitly listed above)

**Note:**  
- As the provided information does not specify explicitly "Accountable," "Consulted," or "Informed" parties, this matrix currently identifies only the main Responsibility for each task. In a full RACI matrix, each activity typically should also have at least an Accountable role clearly indicated.
- If additional clarity regarding accountability or stakeholder involvement is needed, please confirm, and I will gladly update accordingly.
