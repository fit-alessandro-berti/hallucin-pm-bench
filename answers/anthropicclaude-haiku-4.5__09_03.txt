# Process-Mining Audit Response – Orion Aerospace GmbH

## Findings

**I cannot compute the requested metrics.**

The supplied Event-Log Stub (Artefact A) contains only column headers with all row data and all timestamp values redacted. To calculate the average cycle time of the "Approve Invoice" activity, I require the actual start_time and complete_time values for every instance where activity equals "Approve Invoice" across all cases. The cycle time for each activity instance is computed as (complete_time − start_time), and only then can a mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval be derived from the population of individual cycle times. Since every data cell has been removed and only schema metadata remains, no numerical computation is possible. Artefact B provides historical context (7.8 days average and an SLA threshold) but does not substitute for the current event log data required to perform the analysis.

**Recommendation:** To proceed with this audit, the client must provide the Event-Log Stub with at minimum the case_id, activity, start_time, and complete_time columns populated with actual records, or grant a legal exemption to access the full dataset under confidentiality agreement.
