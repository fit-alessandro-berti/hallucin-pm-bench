Let me analyze this XES event log fragment to answer your questions.

First, I'll organize the events by case and timestamp:

**Case C001:**
- Receive_Order (09:12:00)
- Check_Stock (09:20:05)
- Ship_Order (10:05:10)

**Case C002:**
- Receive_Order (09:15:10)
- Check_Stock (09:22:55)
- Arrange_Delivery (10:15:20)
- Ship_Order (10:25:40)

**Case C003:**
- Receive_Order (09:21:30)
- Check_Stock (09:25:05)
- Ship_Order (10:20:30)

Now I can answer the questions:

**Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**
**3** (C001, C002, and C003)

**Q2: For case "C002", list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred:**
Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order

**Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order":**
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
