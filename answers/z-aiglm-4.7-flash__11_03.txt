RE: Critical Performance Issues

Orion’s analysis highlights three activities failing joint SLA breach and high waiting time criteria: Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval’s Avg Throughput Time is 900s, exceeding the Target SLA by 300s with an Avg Waiting Time of 600s. Risk Review shows an Avg Throughput Time of 600s, breaching the Target SLA by 300s with an Avg Waiting Time of 480s. Credit Assessment averages 300s, exceeding the Target SLA by 60s with an Avg Waiting Time of 200s.

Recommendations:
*   Automate document review to reduce Legal Approval time by 300s.
*   Deploy automated risk filters to cut Risk Review Waiting Time by 180s.
*   Integrate automated scoring tools to lower Credit Assessment time by 60s.
