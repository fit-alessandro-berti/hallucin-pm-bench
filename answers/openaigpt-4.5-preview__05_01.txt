Add a timer intermediate event to auto-escalate if claims stall waiting for documents. Specifically, after "Request Missing Docs" (Task_RequestDocs), insert a boundary timer event set to trigger after 36 hours if documents aren't received. Connect the timer event directly to "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage). This ensures all claims reach triage within the 48-hour SLA limit, even if documents remain incomplete. No new tasks or subprocesses are added; only the boundary timer event and adjusted flow connections are introduced around the existing task Task_RequestDocs.
