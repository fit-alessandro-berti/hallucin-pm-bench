Yes, it is possible.  
**Concrete firing sequence:**  
1. Fire T1 (consumes the token in p0, produces tokens in p1 and p2).  
2. Fire T2 (consumes the token in p1, produces a token in p3).  
3. Fire T5 (requires a token in p3 and **zero** tokens in p4; both hold, so it consumes p3 and produces a token in p6).  

After this sequence, T3 has not yet fired. Hence T5 fires before T3.
