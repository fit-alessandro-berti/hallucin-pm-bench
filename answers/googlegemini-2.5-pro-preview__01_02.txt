Here is a summary of the decision points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process and a list of every required document:

**Decision Points:**

*   **Quick KYC Verification (KYC):** A decision to proceed if both the ID card and mobile phone are confirmed. If not, the process cannot continue as specified.
*   **Underwriter Alignment Gate:** A decision based on the difference between the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B:
    *   If the two scores differ by ≤ 2 points, the process continues to the next step.
    *   If the two scores differ by > 2 points, the application is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee**.
        *   **(Decision by) Harmonisation Committee:** This committee makes a tie-break decision to establish a unified risk score.
*   **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC):** An implicit decision point. The process requires at least 3 local references to be collected. If this requirement cannot be met, the process cannot proceed as specified.
*   **Amount Threshold Decision:** A decision based on the requested loan amount:
    *   If the amount is < €15 000, the system auto-approves the loan.
    *   If the amount is ≥ €15 000, the application proceeds to Final Micro-loan Board Approval.
*   **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA):** The board votes to either *approve* or *reject* the micro-loan application.
