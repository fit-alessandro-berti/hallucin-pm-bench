**Question 1:** Yes, T5 can fire before T3.

**Question 2 (bonus):** One minimal firing sequence:
1. T1 (P0 → P1, P2)
2. T2 (P1 → P3)
3. T7 (P3 → P4)
4. T4 (P4 → P5)
5. T3 (P2 → P4) — *but now P4 and P5 are both marked, so P2 is ALSO marked* (from T1)
6. T5 fires: {P2, P5} → P6.

Wait, no—this is incorrect because T3 consumes P2 (readying P4 again), but T5 requires P2 and P5. So this sequence doesn’t work.

Correct sequence:
1. T1 (P0 → P1, P2)
2. T2 (P1 → P3)
3. T7 (P3 → P4)
4. T3 (P2 → P4) — now P4 holds 2 tokens, P2 is empty
5. Before T4,
6. T4 (P4 → P5) – but now P2 is empty, blocking T5.
*Thus, T5 cannot fire before T3.*

**Revised Answer:**
No. To fire T5, P2 must hold a token (required by T5’s input), but T3 consumes P2’s token before T5 can fire. Send?
