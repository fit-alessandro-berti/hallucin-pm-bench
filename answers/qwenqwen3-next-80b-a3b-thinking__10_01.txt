### Key:  
- **A** = Accountable (ultimately answerable for the activity outcome)  
- **I** = Informed (notified after activity completion)  
- *No Consulted (C) or Responsible (R) assignments are required per process description, as all roles are explicitly defined with single accountability and informed status where applicable.*
