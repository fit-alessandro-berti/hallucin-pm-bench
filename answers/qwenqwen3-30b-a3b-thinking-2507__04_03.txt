No  
Justification:  
- Rule 1: Satisfied (QE occurs before RA: *Quality_Engineer_Review* at step 3, *Regulatory_Affairs_Review* at step 5).  
- Rule 2: Satisfied (VP occurs after QE and RA: *VP_Safety_Approval* at step 6, after QE/RA at steps 3/5).  
- Rule 3: **Violated** (Notify_Authorities at step 4 occurs *before* Regulatory_Affairs_Review is complete at step 5).  
- Rule 4: Satisfied (Close_Case at step 7 occurs after NA at step 4 and VP at step 6), but rule 3 violation makes the trace non-compliant.
