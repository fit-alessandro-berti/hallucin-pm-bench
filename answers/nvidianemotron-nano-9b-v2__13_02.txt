1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt.  

2.  
   a) **2.08%** of all events (1/48).  
   b) **8.33%** of all unique cases (1/12).  

3. A low-support activity like **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** (occurring only once in 12 cases) can mislead analyses by creating biased assumptions. If generalized, models might overemphasize its importance or assume it is a standard step, even though it is rare. This could skew performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency) or predictive rules, as the activity’s absence in most cases might be ignored. Such biases risk underestimating variability or overcomplicating processes where this step is irrelevant.
