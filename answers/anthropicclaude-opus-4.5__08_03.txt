# Analysis: Can T5 fire before T3?

## Understanding the Question

I need to determine if there exists a firing sequence from the initial marking where T5 fires without T3 having fired previously.

## Analyzing the Requirements for T5

**T5 requires:** tokens in both `pd` AND `pe`

Let me trace how these places can get tokens:

### Getting a token in `pe`:
- Only **T4** produces a token in `pe`
- T4 requires a token in `pb`
- `pb` gets a token from **T1**

### Getting a token in `pd`:
- **T3** produces a token in `pd` (requires `pc`)
- **T2b** produces a token in `pd` (requires `pa`) ← **This is the key!**

## Finding the Shortest Sequence

**T2b is a shortcut that bypasses T3!**

Starting from initial marking `[p0=1]`:

| Step | Fire | Marking Before | Marking After |
|------|------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | T1 | p0=1 | pa=1, pb=1 |
| 2 | T2b | pa=1, pb=1 | pd=1, pb=1 |
| 3 | T4 | pd=1, pb=1 | pd=1, pe=1 |
| 4 | T5 | pd=1, pe=1 | pf=1 |

## Answer: **YES**

### Shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3:

```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```

**Length: 4 transitions**

### Verification:
- ✅ T1 fires: `p0` → `pa, pb`
- ✅ T2b fires: `pa` → `pd` (shortcut, bypassing pc and T3)
- ✅ T4 fires: `pb` → `pe`
- ✅ T5 fires: `pd, pe` → `pf`
- ✅ T3 has **not** fired in this sequence

The existence of transition **T2b** (the shortcut path `pa → pd`) allows the synchronization place `pd` to receive a token without ever going through `pc` or firing `T3`.
