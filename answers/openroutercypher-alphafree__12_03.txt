No

Justification:
The statement claims that “Validate_Payment” always immediately follows “Receive_Order” with no intervening activities. This holds true for only two cases:

✅ C001:
- Receive_Order → Validate_Payment

✅ C003:
- Receive_Order → Validate_Payment

However, the other valid cases contradict the claim:

❌ C002:  
- Receives a payment check after packing:
- Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment

❌ C004:
- Performs an intermediate fraud check:
- Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment

Cases C002 and C004 present instances where Validate_Payment does not immediately follow Receive_Order, thus violating the proposed pattern in the FACT.
