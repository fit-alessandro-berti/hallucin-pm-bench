Based on Artefact A, the Event-Log Stub, the full dataset is not available, only the first five rows with only headers provided. Therefore, I cannot compute an average cycle time, standard deviation, nor any confidence interval, as I have no activity timestamps or cost data to analyze. Every row requires complete event records to determine durations and perform statistical calculations.
