No. The claim is contradicted by case C003 (lines 6–7), where *Validate_Payment* (line 6) occurs at 10:43:00Z **before** *Receive_Order* (line 7) at 10:45:00Z. Additionally, case C005 (lines 11–12) shows *Validate_Payment* (line 11) followed by *Cancel_Order* (line 12) with no *Receive_Order* event at all, further disproving the assertion that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order*.
