Answer: No

Justification:
• In CaseID C001 and C003, after "Receive_Order", the next activity is "Validate_Payment" (C001: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment; C003: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment).
• However, in CaseID C002, after "Receive_Order", the next activity is "Pack_Items" before "Validate_Payment".
• Similarly, in CaseID C004, "Check_Fraud" intervenes between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment".

Thus, the FACT claiming that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" is not accurate based on the provided log excerpt.
