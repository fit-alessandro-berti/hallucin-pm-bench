**a) Decision points in Acme Bank’s small-business loan-approval process:**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check** – Assigns a risk rating (Low, Medium, High) based on the combined output of the Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow scorecards.  
2. **Conditional Skip Rule** – If the risk rating is Low or Medium *and* the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, the application skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review step.  
3. **TriVote Decision Gate** – The application advances only if at least two out of the three required roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve.

**b) Documents required in the process, in order of appearance:**

1. **Form 14B** – Submitted with the initial application.  
2. **Deck Memo** – Created during Manual-Underwriting-Review (skipped under certain conditions).  
3. **Offer Sheet 77** – Prepared after TriVote approval; must be signed by the applicant.  
4. **ID Matrix Declaration** – Submitted alongside the signed Offer Sheet 77.  
5. **Loan Dossier 2025** – Final compiled document set upon agreement finalization.
