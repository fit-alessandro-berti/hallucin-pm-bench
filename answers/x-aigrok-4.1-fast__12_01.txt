**No, the fact is not accurate.**

In case 1001, "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02).  
In case 1002, "Update_Inventory" is absent, and "Authorize_Refund" (10:18:40) is followed directly by "Refund_Issued" (10:25:10).  
In case 1003, "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs *before* "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18).  

The claimed sequence ("Authorize_Refund" immediately before "Update_Inventory") never occurs.
