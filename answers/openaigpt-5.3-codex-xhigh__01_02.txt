Here are the **decision points** in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process:

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   - Compares scores from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**.  
   - If score difference is **≤ 2 points** → continue to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.  
   - If score difference is **> 2 points** → escalate to **Harmonisation Committee** for tie-break, then continue.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   - If **amount < €15 000** → system auto-approves.  
   - If **amount ≥ €15 000** → proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**  
   - Board votes **approve** or **reject**.  
   - If approved, proceed to **Disburse Funds**.
