Attach an **interrupting Timer Boundary Event** to `Task_RequestDocs`. Configure the timer duration to 48 hours (e.g., `PT48H`). Create a new sequence flow connecting this boundary event to a new **Escalation End Event**.

This change ensures that if the document collection process (`Task_RequestDocs`) stalls, the activity is automatically interrupted before the SLA breaches. The flow is diverted to the **Escalation End Event**, fulfilling the requirement to "auto-escalate" the claim without needing to add any new **tasks** or **subprocesses** to the diagram.
