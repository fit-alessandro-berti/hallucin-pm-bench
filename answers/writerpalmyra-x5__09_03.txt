I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity because the event log contains only the column headers and no data rows. All timestamps, case IDs, and activity instances have been redacted, so there is no temporal information available to calculate durations. Without start and completion times for individual instances of the "Approve Invoice" activity, it is impossible to derive any time-based metrics.
