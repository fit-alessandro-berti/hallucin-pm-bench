Add an interrupting timer boundary event to Task_RequestDocs with a duration attribute of "PT48H". If the timer fires before Task_RequestDocs completes, reconnect its outgoing flow to Task_Triage. This auto-escalates claims (forcing Triage within â‰ˆ48 hours from submission), ensuring SLA compliance for the missing docs path without adding new activities.
