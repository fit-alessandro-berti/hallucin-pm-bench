The requested value cannot be derived from the provided data. 

Explanation:
• The event log excerpt only lists the order of activities per case without including timestamps or elapsed-time values.
• Without timing information for the “Review Contract” events, it is not possible to calculate the cycle time.
• Additionally, the historical benchmark does not include a benchmark duration for “Review Contract,” so we cannot use it as a proxy.
