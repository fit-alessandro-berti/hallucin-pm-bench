**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – determines whether the two underwriter scores differ by ≤ 2 points or require escalation to the Harmonisation Committee.  
2. **Amount Threshold Decision** – determines whether the loan amount is < €15 000 (auto-approve) or ≥ €15 000 (proceed to MBA).  
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – determines whether the loan is approved or rejected by the board.
