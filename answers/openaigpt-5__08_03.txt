Yes.

One shortest firing sequence with T5 before T3:
T1, T2b, T4, T5

Witness markings:
- M0: p0=1
- after T1: pa=1, pb=1
- after T2b: pd=1, pb=1
- after T4: pd=1, pe=1
- after T5: pf=1

T3 has not fired before T5.

Why this is shortest:
- T5 requires tokens in both pd and pe.
- pe can only be produced by T4, which needs pb from T1.
- To get pd without using T3, we must use T2b, which needs pa from T1.
Thus at least T1, T4, and T2b must occur before T5, making 4 transitions total including T5.
