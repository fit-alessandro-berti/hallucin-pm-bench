### Decision Points in Contoso’s Process

The process includes the following decision points, each summarized below:

- **Eligibility Validation**: During **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**, the triage agent decides whether the claim is eligible by checking it against the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*. If ineligible, the process ends without proceeding.
- **Pre-Approval Sign-Off**: During **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**, the finance controller decides whether to approve the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*. Success is required to proceed; failure ends the process.
- **High-Value Branch**: After **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**, the process checks if the refund amount is greater than €1 000. If yes, the case branches to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (which must include the *AuditTrail*); if no, it proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.
- **Payment Readiness Check**: Before **Process_Refund_Payment**, the process verifies that **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** has succeeded *and* (for high-value claims) **Senior_Auditor_Review** has been completed, with a signed *BankTransferAuthorization* present. If conditions are not met, payment cannot begin.
