**Non-compliant**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 2 Violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), which mandates that `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs at event #9 (after shipping). This violates the required sequence.

2. **Rule 3 Violation**: After `Goods_Received` (event #6), `Three_way_match` must be completed **within the next two activities** (distance â‰¤ 2). The subsequent activities are:
   - Event #7: Move_to_Quality (distance = 1)
   - Event #8: Ship_Goods (distance = 2)
   - Event #9: Risk_Assessment (distance = 3)
   - Event #10: Three_way_match (distance = 4)
   
   `Three_way_match` occurs at distance 4, exceeding the maximum allowed distance of 2.

3. **Rule 4 Violation**: Activity `Move_to_Quality` (event #7) executed by role **Intern** directly follows `Goods_Received` (event #6) executed by **Warehouse_Clerk**. While this specific sequence is allowed, we must check if any Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity. Event #4 (`Expedite_Flag` by System) follows event #3 (`Approve_PO_CFO` by CFO), so no Rule 4 violation occurs here.

**Conclusion**: The trace violates Rules 2 and 3, making it non-compliant with P2P-2025.R1.
