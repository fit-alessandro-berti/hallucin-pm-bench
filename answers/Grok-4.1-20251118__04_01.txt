Non-compliant

Justification:
1. Rule 1 violation: The PO amount is €12 300 (> €10 000) and therefore requires two approvals (first Procurement_Officer, then CFO) before the activity Issue_PO. In the trace, Expedite_Flag (event #4) occurs before Issue_PO (#5), meaning that at the moment the PO is issued the required approvals have indeed taken place (#2 and #3), but the rule explicitly states the approvals must be obtained before Issue_PO and does not allow any other activity (such as Expedite_Flag) in between the final approval and Issue_PO. The presence of Expedite_Flag between Approve_PO_CFO and Issue_PO violates the spirit and letter of "before Issue_PO".

2. Rule 2 violation: The trace contains Expedite_Flag (#4), which makes Risk_Assessment mandatory before the first occurrence of Ship_Goods. Ship_Goods occurs at event #8, but Risk_Assessment only occurs later at event #9 (after Ship_Goods). This directly violates the required ordering.

3. Rule 3 violation: After Goods_Received (#6), the activity Three_way_match must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The activities following Goods_Received are: #7 Move_to_Quality, #8 Ship_Goods, #9 Risk_Assessment, #10 Three_way_match. Three_way_match is the 4th activity after Goods_Received (distance = 4 > 2), violating the rule.

4. Rule 4 is satisfied (no Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity; the only Intern activity #7 is preceded by Warehouse_Clerk).

5. Rule 5 is satisfied (the trace ends with Archive_Record #11 and has nothing after it).

The trace is non-compliant due to violations of rules 1, 2, and 3.
