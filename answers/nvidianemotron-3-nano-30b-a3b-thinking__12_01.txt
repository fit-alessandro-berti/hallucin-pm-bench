**Answer:** The fact is **not accurate**.

**Justification**

| Case ID | Event sequence (relevant activities) |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| 1001    | … **Update_Inventory** → **Authorize_Refund** … |
| 1002    | No **Update_Inventory** activity occurs; only **Authorize_Refund** follows **Inspect_Item**. |
| 1003    | … **Update_Inventory** → … → **Quality_Check** → **Authorize_Refund** … |

- In **case 1001**, *Authorize_Refund* occurs **after** *Update_Inventory*, not immediately before it.  
- In **case 1002**, *Update_Inventory* never appears, so the “immediately before *Update_Inventory*” condition cannot be satisfied.  
- In **case 1003**, *Authorize_Refund* occurs **after** *Update_Inventory* but is preceded by a *Quality_Check* activity, breaking the “immediately before” requirement.

Therefore, the claim that *Authorize_Refund* always occurs immediately before *Update_Inventory* within the same case is false.
