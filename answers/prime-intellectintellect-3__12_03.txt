**No**  

The FACT is **inaccurate** because there are cases where "Validate_Payment" does **not** occur immediately after "Receive_Order," and other activities intervene.  

### Justification:  
- **Case C002**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` (09:30) → `Pack_Items` (09:50) → `Validate_Payment` (10:05).  
  Here, `Pack_Items` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.  

- **Case C004**:  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` (10:05) → `Check_Fraud` (10:07) → `Validate_Payment` (10:20).  
  Here, `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.  

### Cases where the FACT holds (for completeness):  
- **Case C001**: `Receive_Order` (09:12) → `Validate_Payment` (09:15) (no intervening activities).  
- **Case C003**: `Receive_Order` (09:40) → `Validate_Payment` (09:44) (no intervening activities).  

Since the FACT claims the sequence **always** occurs immediately (with no exceptions), but **C002** and **C004** violate this pattern, the FACT is **incorrect**.
