Looking at Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder, I need to identify all pairs of tasks that can execute in parallel.

From the description:
- **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** may run simultaneously after Create_Work_Order
- **Quality_Check** and **Create_Documentation** begin in parallel right after Fabricate

The parallel pairs in Process B are:

Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
