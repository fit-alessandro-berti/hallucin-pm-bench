1. **No.**

2. **Justification (by CaseID sequences):**
- **C001:** `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  Here, **Validate_Payment is immediately after Receive_Order** (supports the claim).
- **C003:** `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order`  
  Here, **Validate_Payment is immediately after Receive_Order** (supports the claim).
- **C004:** `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  Here, **an activity (Check_Fraud) occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment**, so Validate_Payment is **not** immediately after Receive_Order (contradicts the claim).
- **C002:** `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  Here, **Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment**, so Validate_Payment is **not** immediately after Receive_Order (contradicts the claim).

Because **C002 and C004** violate the “always immediately after” condition, the FACT is inaccurate.
