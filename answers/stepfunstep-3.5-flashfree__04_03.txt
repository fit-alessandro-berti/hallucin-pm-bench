No

**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1** is satisfied: `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, and each appears exactly once.  
- **Rule 2** is satisfied: For severity "High", `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.  
- **Rule 3** is violated: `Notify_Authorities` occurs *before* `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete, contravening the requirement that it must happen only after both QE and RA are finished.  
- **Rule 4** is satisfied: `Close_Case` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` and after `VP_Safety_Approval` (as required for high severity).  

The violation of Rule 3 makes the trace non-compliant.
