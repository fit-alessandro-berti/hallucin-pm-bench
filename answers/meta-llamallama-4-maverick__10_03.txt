Here is a brief explanation of the RACI assignments:
- **Intake Vetting**: Front-Office Analyst is Responsible.
- **KYC Review**, **AML Screening**, and **Risk Scoring**: Compliance Analyst is Responsible.
- For cases with a risk score exceeding 70, Compliance Officer is Accountable and Responsible for approval. Both Compliance Analyst and Treasury Ops are Informed.
- For cases with a risk score of 70 or less, Treasury Ops is Responsible and Accountable for Payment Scheduling. Compliance Analyst is Informed.
- **Treasury Ops** is Responsible for Releasing Funds.
- Notification is done by the role that initiated or was responsible for the preceding activity; here, both Front-Office Analyst and Treasury Ops could be seen as notifying or being informed. To simplify and follow typical RACI practices, we've marked Treasury Ops as Responsible for notification, and Front-Office Analyst as Informed (since they originated the request). Compliance Analyst is Informed as they need to be aware of the outcome.
