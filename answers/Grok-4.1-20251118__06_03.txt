### Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment

**Concurrent task sets:**

1. **First parallel construct** (after Receive_Stock):  
   - Quality_Check  
   - Update_Inventory  

   (These two tasks can execute concurrently.)

2. **Second parallel construct** (after Store_Items):  
   - Generate_Replenishment_Report  
   - Notify_Procurement  

   (These two tasks can execute concurrently.)

These are the only two sets of tasks that can run in parallel within the same parallel gateway construct in Process B.
