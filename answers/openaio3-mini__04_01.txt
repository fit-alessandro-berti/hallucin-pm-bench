Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 is violated: Since the trace includes an Expedite_Flag (event 4), a Risk_Assessment must occur before the first Ship_Goods. However, Risk_Assessment appears at event 9, after Ship_Goods at event 8.
2. Rule 3 is violated: After the Goods_Received (event 6), the Three_way_match must occur within the next two activities. In the trace, Three_way_match is performed at event 10, which is beyond the allowed window.
