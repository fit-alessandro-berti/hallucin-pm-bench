1️⃣ The exact activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt (in Case 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because:
- The excerpt shows only 3 cases from a full month's data, making it statistically unreliable
- Activity naming inconsistencies exist ("Automatic Fraud Check" vs "Fraud Check (Automatic)"), suggesting "Manual Fraud Check" might appear under different names elsewhere
- The temporal coverage is limited to March 1st morning hours, which may not represent typical processing patterns
- Without knowing the total case volume or sampling method, it's impossible to determine if these 3 cases are representative of the full population
