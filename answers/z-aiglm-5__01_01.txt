Based on the Contoso Airlines process description provided, here is the summary of decision points and the list of required documents.

### Decision Points

There are three distinct decision points within the process flow:

1.  **Eligibility Validation**
    *   **Location:** During **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**.
    *   **Logic:** The triage agent decides whether the claim is valid by checking it against the *FlightManifest* and the *WeatherReport*. This determines if the process can proceed to the pre-approval stage.

2.  **High-Value Amount Check**
    *   **Location:** Following **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**.
    *   **Logic:** The process checks if the refund amount is **greater than €1,000**.
        *   If **True**: The process diverts to **Senior_Auditor_Review**.
        *   If **False**: The process proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment**.

3.  **Pre-Approval Sign-off**
    *   **Location:** During **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**.
    *   **Logic:** The finance controller decides whether to authorize the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*. This is a mandatory prerequisite before payment can be executed.

*(Note: While **Senior_Auditor_Review** is a distinct activity, it functions as a verification step required by the High-Value Amount Check rather than a routing decision point itself.)*
