**No**

Justification:

- **Rule 1 (QE → RA, both exactly once in order)**: Violated. While both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occur, they are **out of order**—RA occurs *after* `Notify_Authorities`, not immediately after QE. The trace shows: QE → NA → RA, which breaks the required sequence.

- **Rule 2 (if severity = "High", VP after QE and RA)**: Violated. Although VP occurs after QE, it also occurs **before RA is complete**, which violates the requirement that VP must come after *both* QE and RA.

- **Rule 3 (NA after QE and RA)**: Violated. `Notify_Authorities` occurs **after QE but before RA**, not after both as required.

- **Rule 4 (CC after NA and, if applicable, VP)**: Satisfied. `Close_Case` occurs after NA and VP, so this final step is in order.

Multiple rule violations found; therefore, the trace is **not compliant**.
