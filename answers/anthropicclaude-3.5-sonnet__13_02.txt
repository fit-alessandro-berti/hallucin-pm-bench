Let me analyze this carefully:

1. **Manual_Fraud_Check** occurs exactly **1 time** in the excerpt (in case C05)

2. Percentage calculations:
   a) Events: 1 out of 48 total events = **2.08%** of events
   b) Cases: 1 out of 12 total cases = **8.33%** of cases

3. With such low support (appearing in only one case), any performance metrics or predictions based on "Manual_Fraud_Check" would be unreliable for generalization. We have only one instance to learn from, which could be an outlier or special case. The single occurrence doesn't provide enough evidence of typical processing times, preceding/following activities, or outcome correlations. Drawing conclusions from such limited data could lead to incorrect process insights or predictions.
