The fact is **not accurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.  

**Justification:**  
In **case 1002**, the activity "Authorize_Refund" occurs at **2025-03-02 10:18:40**, followed by "Refund_Issued" at **2025-03-02 10:25:10**, **not** "Update_Inventory."  
In **case 1003**, "Authorize_Refund" occurs at **2025-03-03 10:22:18**, but "Update_Inventory" occurred earlier at **2025-03-03 10:08:07**.  

Thus, "Authorize_Refund" does **not** always occur immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case.
