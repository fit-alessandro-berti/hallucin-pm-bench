**No**  
- **Rule 1** – satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, each once.  
- **Rule 2** – satisfied. With `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` appears after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3** – violated. `Notify_Authorities` occurs **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, whereas it must wait until after QE and RA.  
- **Rule 4** – violated (by consequence of rule 3). `Close_Case` may only happen after NA has completed, but NA was executed too early, so the required ordering for closing the case is not met.
