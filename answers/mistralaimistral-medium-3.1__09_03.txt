Given the artefacts provided, **none of the requested metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for "Approve Invoice") can be computed** for the following reason:

The event-log stub (Artefact A) contains *only column headers*â€”no actual timestamps, case IDs, or activity rows are available. Without the raw `start_time` and `complete_time` values for the "Approve Invoice" activity, there is no data to calculate durations, means, or variability. The SLA excerpt (Artefact B) provides a *historical average* (7.8 days) for a *different* process segment (from "Approve Invoice" to "Pay Invoice"), which is irrelevant to the cycle time of the "Approve Invoice" activity itself. Process mining requires *instance-level event data*; its absence here makes computation impossible. No assumptions or external data can substitute for the missing log.
