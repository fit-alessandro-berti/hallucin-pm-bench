Let me approach this step by step.

**1. Computing average cycle time of "Approve Invoice":**
Unfortunately, we don't have sufficient data to calculate the average cycle time. We see only the event "Approve Invoice" with one occurrence in the stub, but we need at least multiple occurrences to calculate an average. The stub doesn't provide any timing information beyond the event name, and we can't partition data received from other sources without explicit information.

**2. Standard deviation and 95 % confidence interval:**
Similarly, I cannot compute:
- Standard deviation because we only have *one* event occurrence
- A confidence interval because we lack:
  - The variance of the distribution
  - The sample size
  - The underlying probability distribution (which would need to be normal or parametric)

**3. Conclusion:**
Based on the limited information provided:
I cannot compute either metric because:
- The sample size is zero (only one event)
- No timing data is available
- No distribution properties are provided
- The event log does not provide sufficient data points to perform statistical analysis

The task cannot be completed due to insufficient data.
