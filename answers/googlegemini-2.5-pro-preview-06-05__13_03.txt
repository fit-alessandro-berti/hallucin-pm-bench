Based on the event-log excerpt provided:

1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time.

2️⃣ This excerpt is not a representative sample. With only three cases shown from a single morning, it is too small to make a reliable conclusion about the entire month. The frequency of activities can change based on the time of day, week, or specific case types not present in this snippet. Furthermore, the log shows inconsistent naming for similar activities (e.g., `Automatic Fraud Check` vs. `Fraud Check (Automatic)`). This data quality issue means an analyst could easily miscalculate the true proportion of manual vs. automated checks without viewing the complete, cleaned dataset. Any estimation from this limited view would be unreliable.
