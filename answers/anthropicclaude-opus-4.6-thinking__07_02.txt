## Change Summary

### Added Tasks
| Task ID | Name | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `Task_VerifyIdentity` | **Verify Identity** | New task inserted between `StartEvent_1` and `Task_ReviewApplication`, making identity verification a prerequisite before the application review. |
| `Task_RequestDocs` | **Request Additional Documents** | New branch out of the decision gateway (condition: *"missing docs"*), representing a third possible outcome beyond simple approve/reject. |
| `Task_FinalReject` | **Final Reject** | Replaces the former `Task_RejectLoan` (different ID and name); serves as the rejection path (condition: *"ineligible"*) from the decision gateway. |

### Removed Tasks
| Task ID (v1) | Name (v1) | Details |
|---|---|---|
| `Task_RejectLoan` | **Reject Loan** | No longer present in v2. Its role is effectively superseded by the new `Task_FinalReject` (which carries a different ID, so this is a removal, not a rename). |

### Gateway-Type Changes
| Gateway ID | v1 Type | v2 Type | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Gateway_Decision` | **Exclusive Gateway** (`exclusiveGateway`) | **Inclusive Gateway** (`inclusiveGateway`) | In v1 exactly one outgoing path (*yes* or *no*) could fire. In v2 **one or more** of the three outgoing paths (*eligible*, *missing docs*, *ineligible*) may fire simultaneously, allowing combined outcomes (e.g., auto-approve **and** request additional documents at the same time). |
