Add an interrupting timer boundary event (id="Timer_Check") to Task_Check, with timeDuration="PT48H" to monitor from claim receipt (near submission). Add a new sequence flow from this boundary event to Task_Triage. If the timer expires during Task_Check, it interrupts and escalates directly to triage, ensuring the claim reaches Task_Triage within 48 hours per the SLA. This uses existing elements without new tasks.
