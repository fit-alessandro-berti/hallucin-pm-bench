Here are the decision points in Contoso’s flight-refund process, with the relevant supporting documents called out, followed by a consolidated list of all required documents.

Decision Point A: Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility (eligibility check)
- What happens: The triage agent checks the claim against the FlightManifest and the WeatherReport to determine if the refund request is eligible.
- Outcomes:
  - Eligible → proceed to Finance_Controller_PreApprove
  - Not Eligible → (path not defined in the description)
- Documents involved:
  - RefundRequestForm (provided by the passenger)
  - FlightManifest
  - WeatherReport

Decision Point B: Finance_Controller_PreApprove (pre-approval)
- What happens: The finance controller signs off on the claim using the EligibilityChecklist.
- Outcomes:
  - PreApproved → proceed to the high-value decision and payment gating
  - Not PreApproved → (path not defined in the description)
- Documents involved:
  - EligibilityChecklist
  - RefundRequestForm (context for eligibility)

Decision Point C: High-value determination
- What happens: The system decides whether the refund amount is greater than €1,000.
- Outcomes:
  - Yes (amount > €1,000) → requires Senior_Auditor_Review that must include the AuditTrail
  - No (amount ≤ €1,000) → proceed without Auditor involvement
- Documents involved:
  - RefundRequestForm (to determine the amount)

Decision Point D: Payment readiness (gating for Process_Refund_Payment)
- What happens: The system checks that payment can begin only if prerequisites are met.
- Outcomes:
  - Yes → Process_Refund_Payment can begin
  - No → payment is not started
- Prerequisites (as defined):
  - Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded
  - For high-value claims, Senior_Auditor_Review has completed (which must include AuditTrail)
  - BankTransferAuthorization is present (signed) before payment
- Documents involved:
  - BankTransferAuthorization (must be present)
  - AuditTrail (present as part of Senior_Auditor_Review, if applicable)
  - (Implicit) Senior_Auditor_Review documentation itself, via the AuditTrail
  - RefundRequestForm (as the source of the amount and claim)

Notes on paths and constraints
- The process explicitly states that payment may begin only after Finance_Controller_PreApprove has succeeded and, for high-value claims, after Senior_Auditor_Review is completed. This gating is reflected in Decision Point D.
- The legacy activity CustomerService_Agent_Decide is not part of Contoso’s process, per the constraint.
