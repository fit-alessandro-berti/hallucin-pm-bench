**Non-compliant**

Justification:
1. Rule 1 is violated. A purchase order with a value of €12,300 (>€10,000) must obtain two approvals (Procurement_Officer then CFO) *before* the `Issue_PO` activity. The approvals in events #2 and #3 are completed before `Issue_PO` (#5) and are therefore compliant.
2. Rule 3 is violated. After `Goods_Received` (event #6), the `Three_way_match` (event #10) must be completed within the next *two* activities. The activity that occurs two steps after `Goods_Received` is event #8 (`Ship_Goods`). The `Three_way_match` occurs at event #10, which is outside the required limit (distance = 4, which is greater than 2).
