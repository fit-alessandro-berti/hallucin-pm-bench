I'll analyze the event log fragment to answer your questions.

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occur in this fragment?**

Counting occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check" in the log:
- Line 8: A1002, 2025-05-01T10:50:00, Manual_Fraud_Check

The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time**.

2. **What percentage of all logged events does this represent?**

Total number of events in the log: 18
Number of "Manual_Fraud_Check" events: 1
Percentage = (1/18) Ã— 100 = 5.56%

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain "Manual_Fraud_Check".**

Case identifier: **A1002**

4. **Two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable:**

a) **Limited time window**: The fragment only covers events from a single day (2025-05-01) from 09:00 to 14:05 - approximately 5 hours. This is far too short to represent a full month's activity patterns, as fraud check frequency may vary by time of day, day of week, or throughout the month.

b) **Small sample size**: With only 4 cases (A1001-A1004) and just 1 instance of Manual_Fraud_Check, the sample is too small to make statistically reliable estimates. The 25% rate (1 out of 4 cases) could be heavily influenced by random variation and may not represent the true population proportion.
