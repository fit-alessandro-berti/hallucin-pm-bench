Add a **timer boundary event** with a 48-hour duration on **Task_Triage**. If the task hasn't started within 48 hours of the process initiation, the timer triggers an escalation (e.g., via a parallel flow to a hidden escalation task, avoiding new user-visible activities). This enforces the SLA by measuring time from the start event to task initiation, using existing elements without adding new tasks. Reference: Task_Triage.
