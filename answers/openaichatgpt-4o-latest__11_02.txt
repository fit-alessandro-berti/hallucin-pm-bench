**Executive Summary: Claims Handling Process – Q1 2025 Performance Highlights**  

Based on Q1-2025 metrics, the three worst-performing activities are:

1. Request_Documents:  
  - Under-performs due to extremely high wait time (150 min) and highest rework rate (22.0%), contributing to a 5.5% SLA breach rate.  
  - Action: Redesign input requests by analyzing the root causes of rework; likely causes include unclear instructions or incomplete document prompts.

2. Review_Documents:  
  - Exhibits high processing time (25 min), large variability (9 min), and one of the highest SLA breach rates (12.4%).  
  - Action: Introduce standardized checklists or AI-assisted document validation to reduce processing inconsistency and time.

3. Initial_Assessment:  
  - Ranks third due to elevated average wait time (18 min), moderate processing time (12 min) with high variability (4 min), and a 3.2% SLA breach rate.  
  - Action: Analyze upstream case routing or triage logic to reduce delays; improvements in workload balancing may lower queue times.

These areas present the clearest opportunities for performance gains across efficiency, timeliness, and SLA compliance.
