1. **Manual_Fraud_Check occurrences:** **1** (only in case C05).

2. Percentages  
   a) Of all events: \(1/48 = 2.08\%\)  
   b) Of all cases: \(1/12 = 8.33\%\)

3. **Why it can mislead (≤100 words):**  
Because the activity appears in only one case, any timing, outcome, or predictive influence inferred from it relies on a single observation. This low support makes averages and performance measures unstable and prone to outlier effects. A model may overfit this rare path or wrongly assume it is typical, leading to biased conclusions about fraud handling or payout decisions when generalised beyond this slice.
