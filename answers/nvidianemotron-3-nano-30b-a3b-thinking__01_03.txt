**a) Decision points (gate / conditional branch) – one‑sentence rule for each**

1. **Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check outcome** – The system produces a risk rating of *Low, Medium* or *High* that determines whether the loan can proceed to the next step.  

2. **Skip‑Manual‑Underwriting gate** – *If* the risk rating is **Low or Medium** **and** the requested amount is **≤ €250 000**, the process **skips** the Manual‑Underwriting‑Review step.  

3. **TriVote approval gate** – A loan moves forward only when **any two of the three required sign‑offs** (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) are granted.

**b) All documents required anywhere in the process – in the order they first appear**

| Order of first appearance | Document (as named in the process) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Form 14B** – the application form received in Step 1 |
| 2 | **Deck Memo** – the output of the Manual‑Underwriting‑Review in Step 5 |
| 3 | **Offer Sheet 77** – the binding‑offer document prepared in Step 7 (later required signed in Step 8) |
| 4 | **ID Matrix Declaration** – the declaration collected from the applicant in Step 8 |
| 5 | **Loan Dossier 2025** – the final dossier compiled in Step 9 |

These are the only documents referenced as “required” throughout Acme Bank’s in‑house small‑business loan‑approval workflow.
