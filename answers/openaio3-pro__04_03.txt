No.

Rule-1: QE occurs once (step 3) and RA occurs once (step 5) and QE precedes RA → satisfied.  
Rule-2: Severity = High, VP must be after QE & RA; VP is at step 6, after both → satisfied.  
Rule-3: NA must wait until both QE and RA are complete; NA is at step 4, before RA (step 5) → violated.  
Rule-4: CC is after NA (step 4) and VP (step 6) ⇒ satisfied.

Because Rule 3 is violated, the trace is not compliant.
