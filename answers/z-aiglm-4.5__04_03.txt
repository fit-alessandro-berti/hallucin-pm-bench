**No**  

**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1**: Satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurs at position 3, and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occurs at position 5, in the required order (QE before RA).  
- **Rule 2**: Satisfied. Given `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs at position 6, after both QE (position 3) and RA (position 5).  
- **Rule 3**: **Violated**. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs at position 4, but RA (which must precede NA) does not occur until position 5. NA happens before RA is complete, violating the requirement that NA must occur **after** both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 4**: Satisfied. `Close_Case` (CC) occurs at position 7, after NA (position 4) and VP (position 6), as required.  

**Final Decision**: The trace violates Rule 3, making it non-compliant.
