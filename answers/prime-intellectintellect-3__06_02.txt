Based solely on **Process B — Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing**, the sets of tasks that may execute concurrently are:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability  
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing  
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware  

**Explanation**:  
- Step 2 explicitly defines **Parallel Block P1** with two concurrent tasks: `Generate_CAD_Drawing` and `Confirm_Materials_Availability`.  
- Step 3 defines **Parallel Block P2** with three concurrent tasks: `Milling_Panels`, `Turning_Legs`, and `CNC_Detailing`.  
- Step 6 defines **Parallel Block P3** with three concurrent tasks: `Sand_Surfaces`, `Apply_Stain`, and `Install_Hardware`.  
- All other tasks (`Accept_Custom_Order`, `Dry_Fit_Assembly`, `Glue_And_Clamp`, `Final_Inspection`) are sequential and excluded from concurrency.
