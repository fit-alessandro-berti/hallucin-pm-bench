To Orion Insurance Leadership,

**Executive Summary**  
Based on last 12 months' process data, the top three **most extreme waiting-time bottlenecks** are:  

1.  **Request_Documents** (Avg: 36.5h, 95th: 120h)  
    *   Implement automated document-retrieval systems to reduce wait times by ≥20%.  

2.  **Send_Closure_Letter** (Avg: 12.2h, 95th: 44.0h)  
    *   Integrate closure-letter generation into the assessment workflow to expedite delivery.  

3.  **Assess_Liability** (Avg: 7.8h, 95th: 16.4h)  
    *   Deploy AI-powered assessment tools to process high-risk claims faster.  

Acting on these will directly target claims resolution delays.
