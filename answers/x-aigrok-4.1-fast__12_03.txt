**No**

**Justification:**  
The FACT is inaccurate. In **C002**, the sequence is Receive_Order (09:30:00) → **Pack_Items (09:50:00)** → Validate_Payment (10:05:00), showing "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment." While C001 and C003 have Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order, C002 provides a counterexample violating the "always" claim. C004 also has Check_Fraud between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.
