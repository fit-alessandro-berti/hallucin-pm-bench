**Decision‑point 1 – Customer Submit Claim**  
*What happens*: The passenger completes a **RefundRequestForm**.  
*Required documents*: **RefundRequestForm** (the only document needed at this point).

**Decision‑point 2 – Triage Agent Validate Eligibility**  
*What happens*: The triage agent reviews the claim against the recorded **FlightManifest** and the **WeatherReport** to decide whether the claim can continue.  
*Required documents*: **FlightManifest**, **WeatherReport** (used by the agent to make the eligibility decision).

**Decision‑point 3 – Finance Controller PreApprove**  
*What happens*: The finance controller signs off the claim using the **EligibilityChecklist** and must retain evidence of that sign‑off.  
*Required documents*: **EligibilityChecklist** (the checklist used for sign‑off) – the signed checklist itself is the artefact needed for the next step.

**Decision‑point 4 – Senior Auditor Review** (only for high‑value claims)  
*What happens*: When the refund amount exceeds €1 000, the case is escalated to the senior auditor, who must attach an **AuditTrail** to the review file.  
*Required documents*: **AuditTrail** (the audit‑trail record that must be completed by the auditor).

**Decision‑point 5 – Process Refund Payment**  
*What happens*: Payment can be executed only after both the finance controller’s pre‑approval **and** (if applicable) the senior auditor’s review have been completed. The finance team needs the signed **BankTransferAuthorization** to move forward.  
*Required documents*: **BankTransferAuthorization** (the signed authorization that must be present before payment is processed).

**Decision‑point 6 – Issue Confirmation Letter**  
*What happens*: Once payment is executed, the system generates a **RefundConfirmationPDF**, which is emailed to the passenger.  
*Required documents*: **RefundConfirmationPDF** (the PDF confirmation that is sent to the passenger).
