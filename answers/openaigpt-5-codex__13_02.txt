1. The activity **Manual_Fraud_Check** occurs **1** time.

2. Percentages  
   a) Events: \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 = 2.08\% \)  
   b) Cases: \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 = 8.33\% \)

3. With only one instance (case C05), Manual_Fraud_Check lacks statistical support. Performance metrics derived from it (e.g., claim throughput or resource effort) would rely on a single observation, yielding high variance and unstable averages. Predictive models trained on this sliver might overemphasize the activityâ€™s importance or timing, misinforming broader process decisions when the step is almost absent in the log.
