1) The average cycle time of the activity **“Review Contract”** cannot be derived from the provided data.  

2) **Explanation**: Cycle time requires timestamps to calculate the duration between the start and end of an activity. The provided log header lacks timestamp fields (as explicitly stated: "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted"). Without temporal data, it is impossible to compute the cycle time for any activity, including "Review Contract". The historical benchmark is irrelevant here, as it pertains to different activities and a separate customer segment.
