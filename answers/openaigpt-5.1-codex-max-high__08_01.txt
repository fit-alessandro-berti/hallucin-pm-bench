Yes. After the initial split you can build \(p_3\) while \(p_4\) is still empty and take \(T_5\) before \(T_3\) ever produces \(p_4\):

- \(T_1\): \(p_0\)→\(p_1+p_2\), marking \(p_1=1,p_2=1,p_3=p_4=0\).
- \(T_2\): \(p_1\)→\(p_3\), marking \(p_3=1,p_2=1,p_4=0\).
- Now \(T_5\) is enabled because \(p_3\) has a token and \(p_4\) is still 0, so fire \(T_5\): \(p_3\)→\(p_6\).

If you want \(T_3\) to occur later, you can then fire \(T_3\) from the remaining token on \(p_2\). In this sequence \(T_5\) occurs before \(T_3\).
