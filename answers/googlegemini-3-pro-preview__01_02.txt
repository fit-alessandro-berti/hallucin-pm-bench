Based on Acme Bank's non-standard **Micro-loan Fast-Track process** (May 2025), here is the summary of decision points and the required documentation.

### Decision Points

1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate** (Step 5)
    *   **Trigger:** Comparison of risk scores (0–9) independently assigned by **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   If the score difference is **≤ 2 points**: The process continues immediately to the Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC).
        *   If the score difference is **> 2 points**: The case is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision before continuing.

2.  **Amount Threshold Decision** (Step 7)
    *   **Trigger:** Evaluation of the requested loan amount.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   If amount is **< €15 000**: The system **auto-approves**.
        *   If amount is **≥ €15 000**: The case proceeds to the Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).

3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** (Step 8)
    *   **Trigger:** Board review for high-value requests (≥ €15 000).
    *   **Logic:** The board votes to either *approve* or *reject* the application.
