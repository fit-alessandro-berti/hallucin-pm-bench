**1) The average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the provided data.**

**2) Explanation:**
The event log header includes only **case_id, activity, and resource**—**timestamps and elapsed-time fields are redacted**. Without duration or start/end timestamps for each activity, it is impossible to calculate cycle times (e.g., how long "Review Contract" took per case or on average).

The historical benchmarks provided are for a **different customer segment** and unrelated to this log, so they cannot be used to infer values here.

---
**Key Limitation:**
Cycle time requires **time-based data** (e.g., `start_timestamp`, `end_timestamp`, or `duration`). The log lacks this information.
