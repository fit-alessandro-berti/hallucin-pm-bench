Based exclusively on the Contoso Airlines process outlined, here is the summary of the decision point and the complete list of required documents.

### **Decision Point**
There is exactly **one** formal routing decision point in Contoso’s process:

*   **The High-Value Review Decision:** 
    *   **Condition:** Is the refund amount greater than €1 000?
    *   **Path A (Greater than €1 000):** The process branches to **Senior_Auditor_Review** following the **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** step. This review must be completed before the refund can be processed.
    *   **Path B (€1 000 or less):** The process skips the senior audit and proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment** once the **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** succeeds.

### **Required Documents (Artefacts)**
The following are all the documents and artefacts explicitly required throughout the process:

1.  **RefundRequestForm** – Completed online by the passenger during *Customer_Submit_Claim*.
2.  **FlightManifest** – Checked by the triage agent during *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*.
3.  **WeatherReport** – Checked by the triage agent during *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*.
4.  **EligibilityChecklist** – Used by the finance controller to sign off during *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*.
5.  **AuditTrail** – Required for high-value claims during the *Senior_Auditor_Review*.
6.  **BankTransferAuthorization** – Must be signed and present to execute payment during *Process_Refund_Payment*.
7.  **RefundConfirmationPDF** – Emailed to the passenger during *Issue_Confirmation_Letter*. 

*(Note in accordance with guidelines: No variations or legacy steps, such as "CustomerService_Agent_Decide", exist in this workflow.)*
