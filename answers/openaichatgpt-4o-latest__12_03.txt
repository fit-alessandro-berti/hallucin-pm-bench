1. No.

2. Justification:

- CaseID C001:  
  Sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items  
  ✅ Here, Validate_Payment does occur immediately after Receive_Order.

- CaseID C002:  
  Sequence: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment  
  ❌ Here, Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, violating the "immediately after" condition.

- CaseID C003:  
  Sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order  
  ✅ Validate_Payment follows Receive_Order immediately.

- CaseID C004:  
  Sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items  
  ❌ Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment.

Conclusion: In CaseIDs C002 and C004, Validate_Payment does not occur immediately after Receive_Order. Hence, the statement is inaccurate.
