**1. Answer:** No

**2. Justification:**  
The FACT claims that “Validate_Payment” always occurs immediately after “Receive_Order,” with no other activities in between. However, the log excerpt contains at least one CaseID that violates this sequence:

- **CaseID C002**:  
  Sequence:  
  - Receive_Order (2025-01-03T09:30:00)  
  - Pack_Items (2025-01-03T09:50:00) ← *This occurs before Validate_Payment*  
  - Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:05:00)  

  Here, “Pack_Items” intervenes between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment,” which contradicts the claim that “Validate_Payment” *always* occurs immediately after “Receive_Order” with no other activities in between.

Additionally:
- **CaseID C004**:  
  Sequence:  
  - Receive_Order (2025-01-03T10:05:00)  
  - Check_Fraud (2025-01-03T10:07:00) ← *Another activity before Validate_Payment*  
  - Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:20:00)  

  This also violates the stated rule, as “Check_Fraud” occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment.”

Therefore, the FACT is **not accurate** based on the evidence in the log.
