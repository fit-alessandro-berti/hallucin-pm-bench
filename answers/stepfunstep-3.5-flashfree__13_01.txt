4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Small sample size:** The fragment contains only 18 events from a single day and only 4 cases, which is insufficient to represent monthly activity.  
   - **Temporal bias:** Data is collected only from 2025‑05‑01; it does not capture variations across different days, weeks, or months (e.g., weekday vs. weekend effects, seasonal trends).
