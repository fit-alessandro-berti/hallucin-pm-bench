1) The requested value cannot be derived.

2) **Explanation:**
To calculate the average cycle time for the activity "Review Contract," specific duration data (start and end timestamps or an elapsed time field) is required. The provided event log header explicitly states that timestamps and elapsed-time fields have been redacted. Furthermore, the historical benchmark data provided does not include a value for "Review Contract" and, per the context description, applies to a different customer segment and fiscal year, making it an invalid substitute for the missing log data.
