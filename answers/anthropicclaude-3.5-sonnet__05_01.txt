Add a boundary timer event on "Task_Check" set to 48 hours that connects directly to "Task_Triage". This creates an escalation path that bypasses the documentation gateway when the SLA threshold is reached. The timer ensures claims won't get stuck waiting for documents beyond the 48-hour limit. The original path through GW_Docs remains active for normal flow when documents are complete before the timer expires.
