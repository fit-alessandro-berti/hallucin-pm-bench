We need to parse the problem: The user gives two processes named Process A – Retail_Ordering and Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder. The user says: "List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." They also say ignore Process A entirely. Provide the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in overall list. Output one pair per line, using format "Task_X — Task_Y".

Thus we need to generate all pairs of tasks in Process B that can run concurrently (i.e., in parallel) given the description.

We must be careful: The description includes ordering constraints, but also concurrency arises when tasks can happen at the same time after certain prerequisites are satisfied. So we need to analyze the process B to identify tasks that can be executed in parallel.

Let's read Process B description fully:

1. Create_Work_Order  
2. Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run simultaneously.  
3. Fabricate begins only after both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines are complete.  
4. Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel right after Fabricate.  
5. Package starts when both Quality_Check and Create_Documentation are finished.  
6. Dispatch_to_Customer follows Package.  
7. Close_Work_Order completes the process.

We need to list all pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel. This includes all tasks that can be scheduled concurrently at any point in the process, respecting relationships.

We need to define tasks: The tasks are:

- Create_Work_Order (CWO)
- Procure_Materials (PM)
- Schedule_Machines (SM)
- Fabricate (F)
- Quality_Check (QC)
- Create_Documentation (CD)
- Package (P)
- Dispatch_to_Customer (DC)
- Close_Work_Order (CW)

Thus nine tasks.

We need to find all pairs (X,Y) where X and Y can be executed in parallel at some point in the process, not necessarily simultaneously, but given concurrency constraints.

Let's analyze the process B step by step.

Step 1: Create_Work_Order. This must happen before any other tasks start, because they start "immediately after". So maybe something like the first tasks start after CWO. Actually, the description says "Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run simultaneously." So CWO must be done before PM and SM start. So CWO cannot be parallel with any later tasks, because they start after it. However, could CWO be parallel with PM and SM? The description says "may start immediately after Create_Work_Order" meaning you can start PM and SM right after CWO; they cannot start before. So CWO must be done before PM and SM. So CWO is a predecessor for PM and SM.

Thus any pair involving CWO and any other tasks (PM, SM, etc.) cannot be parallel, because they must happen after CWO. But maybe after CWO, multiple tasks can run simultaneously. So CWO cannot be parallel with any other task except perhaps if there are multiple CWO? No, only one CWO.

Thus any pair (CWO, X) where X != CWO cannot be executed in parallel because CWO must be completed before X starts.

Thus pairs to consider are only among tasks other than CWO: PM, SM, F, QC, CD, P, DC, CW.

Now we need to consider precedence constraints.

- PM and SM can run concurrently after CWO, and they both must be completed before Fabricate starts. So PM and SM must be completed before F.

Thus F cannot start before both PM and SM are done. So F runs after PM and SM. So the constraints are:

- CWO → PM
- CWO → SM
- PM → F
- SM → F

Also, after F, QC and CD can start in parallel (both start right after F). So we have:

- F → QC
- F → CD

Thus QC and CD can be executed in parallel (or at least they can start at same time after F). QC and CD may have no further constraints between them (they can run concurrently). So QC and CD can be done in parallel.

Now after QC and CD are done (both must be done) before Package starts. So:

- QC → P
- CD → P

Thus P can only start after both QC and CD are done. So QC and CD must be done before P. P could be time-consuming; after P, DC follows.

Thus DC can only start after Package is done. So:

- P → DC

Thus DC cannot be parallel with P, but could be parallel with other tasks? Possibly not, because DC is a single final step after P.

Now CW (Close_Work_Order) completes the process, but no constraints given for it other than "Close_Work_Order completes the process". It likely can start after DC is done. So:

- DC → CW

Thus CW must be after DC.

Thus overall concurrency possibilities: tasks that can be parallel from the start (CWO after?), tasks that can be parallel after CWO (PM and SM), tasks that can be parallel after F (QC and CD). Also we might have possibilities where QC can be parallel with PM or SM? Let's see: Are there constraints that QC cannot start before PM or SM? QC starts after Fabricate. Fabricate starts after PM and SM. So QC cannot start before PM and SM are done. So QC cannot be parallel with PM or SM. Similarly CD cannot be parallel with PM or SM. P cannot be parallel with QC or CD? Actually P can only start after QC and CD are done. So P cannot be parallel with QC or CD. DC cannot be parallel with P. CW cannot be parallel with DC or P.

Thus concurrency pairs are:

- PM and SM (they can run concurrently after CWO)
- QC and CD (they can start after F)
- Possibly QC or CD with something else? No.

But also perhaps after F, QC and CD both start at same time; they could be considered parallel, but also maybe QC could be parallel with something else like DC? No, DC cannot start before P, which cannot start before QC and CD. So QC and CD cannot be parallel with DC or P.

But maybe after QC and CD are done, you could do QC again while CD runs? No, they started concurrently.

Thus total pairs are (PM, SM) and (QC, CD). Also maybe (QC, CD) is a pair. Are there any other pairs? Let's double-check all possible pairs among tasks in Process B:

List tasks: CWO, PM, SM, F, QC, CD, P, DC, CW.

All possible pairs (9 choose 2 = 36). Identify which pairs are allowed by constraints.

Constraints:

- CWO → PM
- CWO → SM
- PM → F
- SM → F
- F → QC
- F → CD
- QC → P
- CD → P
- P → DC
- DC → CW

Thus all pairs that satisfy the constraints as parallel possible.

We need pairs where tasks can run in parallel (i.e., can be executed simultaneously) but not necessarily that any constraints are missing. Typically concurrency means tasks can be scheduled to run at same time (or one after the other) as long as they are not in a direct precedence relationship that prevents that. However the problem may ask "that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." That implies we need to consider the process constraints: tasks that can be executed concurrently without violating any ordering constraints. This includes tasks that are not directly related by any precedence relation.

Thus we need to find pairs of tasks where there is no order constraint that forces one before the other (i.e., tasks are not directly ordered). However there could be indirect constraints: e.g., QC and PM cannot be done in parallel because QC depends on Fabricate, which depends on PM. But if QC depends indirectly on PM, they cannot be parallel. But if a pair has constraints that one must be after the other, they can't be parallel.

Thus we need to find pairs that are not directly ordered (i.e., not a predecessor relationship). Also tasks that are independent (i.e., no direct dependencies between them). However also tasks that have constraints that they could start at same time after a common predecessor (e.g., PM and SM are independent after CWO). That is a pair.

Also after F, QC and CD are independent.

Thus (QC, CD) are independent after F.

What about QC and CD being independent of each other, but also they could be parallel with something else? For example, after F, QC and CD can start, but maybe QC could also start at the same time as PM? No, because PM must be done before F, and QM must be done before F. So QC must start after F, but could QC start before PM? No, because F must be after both PM and SM. So QC cannot start before PM. So QC cannot be parallel with PM.

Similarly QC could be parallel with SM? No.

Thus only pairs are (PM, SM) and (QC, CD). Also maybe (QC, CD) is the only pair of tasks that can be parallel after F. Also maybe (PM, CD) could be parallel? Let's examine: PM must be done before F, CD must start after F, so CD cannot start before PM. So they cannot be parallel.

What about (QC, PM)? QC after F after PM, so QC cannot be parallel with PM.

Thus only pairs.

But also maybe (QC, DC) could be parallel? DC after P, and P after QC and CD, so QC cannot be parallel with DC. So no.

Thus answer: (PM — SM) and (QC — CD). Sorted alphabetically: each pair must be sorted alphabetical, both within pair and overall.

Check alphabetical order: The pair "CD — QC"? Actually alphabetical within each pair: The pair (QC, CD) alphabetical order "CD — QC" vs "QC — CD"? The instruction: "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." So within each pair, tasks are sorted alphabetically: "CD — QC". For the other pair "PM — SM". Then overall list: pairs sorted alphabetically according to the first task? The instruction: "both within each pair and in your overall list." So we need to sort the pairs as strings (like "CD QC", "PM SM") lexicographically. Let's sort: "CD QC" vs "PM SM". Alphabetically "CD QC" comes before "PM SM" because 'C' < 'P'. So the overall list: first "CD — QC", then "PM — SM".

Thus output:

CD — QC
PM — SM

We need to ensure we use the exact format: "Task_X — Task_Y" with a space before and after the dash and a space between tasks? The example: "Task_X  —  Task_Y". So there are two spaces before and after the dash. We'll output exactly that.

Thus answer: "CD — QC" on one line, then "PM — SM" on another line.

We need to be careful: Did we miss any pair? Let's double-check all tasks and dependencies.

Process B tasks:

1. Create_Work_Order (CWO) – must happen before others
2. Procure_Materials (PM) – starts after CWO
3. Schedule_Machines (SM) – starts after CWO
4. Fabricate (F) – after PM and SM
5. Quality_Check (QC) – after F
6. Create_Documentation (CD) – after F
7. Package (P) – after QC and CD
8. Dispatch_to_Customer (DC) – after P
9. Close_Work_Order (CW) – after DC

Thus concurrency possibilities:

- CWO must be before any other tasks, so no concurrency with them.
- After CWO, PM and SM can run concurrently. They are independent.
- After F, QC and CD can run concurrently. They are independent.
- After QC and CD, P can start.
- After P, DC can start.
- After DC, CW.

Thus concurrency pairs: (PM, SM) and (QC, CD). Are there any other pairs that are independent? For example, after F, QC and CD can start, but also maybe QC could start before CD? Actually they start both after F, but they are independent but they could be scheduled sequentially: QC then CD or CD then QC. The question is "can be executed in parallel according to the description". This suggests that tasks that could be executed concurrently at some point, i.e., they are not ordered, but can be swapped. It doesn't require that they must be executed concurrently, but that they are not constrained to be sequential. So any pair of tasks that are not directly ordered (i.e., not predecessor/successor) could potentially be executed in parallel, but constraints may still require one to happen before the other indirectly. However the phrase "according to the description above" indicates we need to identify pairs that can be executed in parallel given the description. Typically, concurrency means tasks that have no direct precedence relationship. Let's see if any other pair is not directly ordered.

List all pairs and see relationship:

CWO with others: directly preceded, so cannot be parallel.

PM with SM: no direct precedence; they can run concurrently.

PM with F: PM before F, so cannot be parallel.

PM with QC: PM before F; QC after F; so cannot be parallel.

PM with CD: PM before F, CD after F, cannot be parallel.

PM with P: PM before F, P after QC and CD, cannot be parallel.

PM with DC: cannot be parallel.

PM with CW: cannot be parallel.

SM with F: SM before F, cannot be parallel.

SM with QC: cannot be parallel.

SM with CD: cannot be parallel.

SM with P: cannot.

SM with DC: cannot.

SM with CW: cannot.

F with QC: F -> QC, so cannot be parallel.

F with CD: F -> CD, cannot be parallel.

F with P: F before P, cannot be parallel.

F with DC: cannot.

F with CW: cannot.

QC with CD: QC -> P, CD -> P. No direct precedence between QC and CD. They can be parallel.

QC with P: QC -> P, cannot be parallel.

QC with DC: cannot.

QC with CW: cannot.

CD with P: CD -> P, cannot be parallel.

CD with DC: cannot.

CD with CW: cannot.

P with DC: P -> DC, cannot.

P with CW: cannot.

DC with CW: DC -> CW, cannot.

Thus only two pairs.

Thus answer is two pairs.

But check the wording: "List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." It might be interpreted as tasks that can be executed simultaneously (i.e., concurrency). So we need to list pairs that can be executed simultaneously. That includes maybe also PM and SM (they can start concurrently) and QC and CD (they can start concurrently). Are there any other pairs that could be executed concurrently at some later stage? For example, after QC and CD are done, maybe QC could be executed again while CD runs? No, they are tasks, not repeated.

Perhaps after F, QC and CD both start in parallel, but also maybe QC and CD could be executed in parallel with each other but also there might be a third task that can start after F as well? Actually F just produces two tasks: QC and CD. There is no other task that can start after F besides QC and CD. So only QC and CD can be parallel.

Thus answer is correct.

Now we need to ensure we output alphabetical order within each pair, and overall list sorted.

Thus final output:

CD — QC
PM — SM

Check alphabetical order: "CD QC" < "PM SM". Yes.

Thus answer.

But before finalizing, maybe we need to consider that the tasks could be executed in parallel if they are not directly connected, but maybe there are also tasks that can be executed in parallel after some tasks are completed but before others. For example, after CWO, we could execute PM and SM concurrently. Also after CWO, we could also execute QC concurrently with PM? But QC cannot start before F, which cannot start before PM and SM. So QC cannot start before PM and SM. So not possible.

Thus answer is correct.

Nevertheless, we need to double-check if "Schedule_Machines" could be considered to be executed after "Procure_Materials"? The description says "may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run simultaneously." It doesn't say they must be in any order relative to each other, just "may run simultaneously". So they can be parallel.

Now, maybe there is a nuance: After all tasks are done, we close the work order. Could "Close_Work_Order" be done concurrently with something else? No, because it's at the end.

Thus answer is correct.

But the problem might be more complex: It asks "List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." This could also be interpreted as "list all pairs of tasks that could be executed in parallel (i.e., could be scheduled concurrently) given the process description." That includes tasks that have no ordering constraints. However, it might also include tasks that can be executed in parallel at different points in the process if they are not directly related. But we have only tasks that are directly independent: PM and SM, QC and CD.

Thus answer is correct.

Now I will produce the final answer accordingly.

Also note the instruction: "Output one pair per line, using the format Task_X  —  Task_Y". So we need a line break after each pair. We need to ensure we have two spaces before and after the dash.

Thus final answer:

CD — QC
PM — SM

Now I'll produce the final answer.



CD — QC
PM — SM
