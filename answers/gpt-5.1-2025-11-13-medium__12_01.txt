No, the fact is **not** accurate for this event-log fragment.

- **Case 1001**: `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund`  
  Sequence: `... Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued`

- **Case 1003**: `Update_Inventory` again occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund`  
  Sequence: `... Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund`

- **Case 1002**: There is **no** `Update_Inventory` activity at all; `Authorize_Refund` is followed by `Refund_Issued`.

Thus, `Authorize_Refund` never occurs immediately before `Update_Inventory` in any case shown.
