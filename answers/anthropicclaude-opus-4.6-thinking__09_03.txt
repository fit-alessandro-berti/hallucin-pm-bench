I cannot compute the average cycle time of the activity "Approve Invoice," its standard deviation, or a 95 % confidence interval from the information provided. Artefact A supplies only the column headers of the event log; every data row and every timestamp value has been explicitly redacted. Without actual `start_time` and `complete_time` values for instances of the "Approve Invoice" activity, there are no numerical inputs from which any duration, mean, variance, or confidence interval can be derived. Artefact B gives a historically reported average for the span between "Approve Invoice" and "Pay Invoice" (7.8 days), but that is an inter-activity lead time from a separate 2023 dashboard, not the intra-activity cycle time (processing duration) of "Approve Invoice" itself, so it cannot be substituted. In short, the requested metrics are mathematically impossible to produce from the artefacts shared, and any figures I might offer would be fabricated rather than computed. The client would need to provide the un-redacted event log—or at minimum the start and complete timestamps for all "Approve Invoice" events—before this analysis can proceed.
