Okay, I'm going to compare these two BPMN versions step by step. The user wants a clear list of functional changes under three specific headings. Let me take it one section at a time.

First, **ADDED TASKS**: I need to look for tasks present in v2 that aren't in v1. Scanning through the XML:

- In v2, there are two new service tasks: `Task_FraudCheck` with name "Automated Fraud Check" and `Task_FastTrackApproval` with name "Fast-Track Approval". There's also a new send task: `Task_NotifyCustomer` named "Notify Customer". These tasks are absent in v1.

Next, **REMOVED TASKS**: I should check if any tasks present in v1 are missing in v2.

- In v1, there's a user task `Task_ManualReview` named "Manual Review". This doesn't appear in v2. So, it's been removed.

Now, **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: The task is to note any gateways where the type has changed between versions.

- `Gateway_ReviewNeeded` in v1 is an exclusive gateway (`exclusiveGateway`), but in v2 it's changed to a parallel gateway (`parallelGateway`). That's one change.
- Also, `Gateway_Payment` in v1 is an exclusive gateway, and in v2 it's a parallel gateway. That's another change.

For the gateways, both instances are switching to parallel gateways. I need to make sure I list both correctly with their IDs and the change as per the required format.

Wait, looking back, shouldn't the change for gateways be stated as *«old type → new type»*? In the example, it was like `exclusive → parallel`. The tags in XML are `exclusiveGateway` and `parallelGateway`, but when referring to the gateway type, we use "exclusive" and "parallel", right? So, for `Gateway_ReviewNeeded`, the change is from `exclusive` to `parallel`. Same for `Gateway_Payment`.

I should ensure that I'm not including any unchanged elements or adding extra commentary. Only mentioning the differences here.

Putting it all together, the summary should be:

- **ADDED TASKS**: List the added service and send tasks with their IDs and names.
- **REMOVED TASKS**: The removed manual review task.
- **GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES**: Both gateways changed from exclusive to parallel.

Let me cross-verify each point once more to avoid any mistakes.

Yes, that seems accurate. I think I've covered all the changes without any unnecessary information.
- ADDED TASKS  
Task_FraudCheck (Automated Fraud Check)  
Task_FastTrackApproval (Fast-Track Approval)  
Task_NotifyCustomer (Notify Customer)  

- REMOVED TASKS  
Task_ManualReview (Manual Review)  

- GATEWAY TYPE CHANGES  
Gateway_ReviewNeeded: exclusive → parallel  
Gateway_Payment: exclusive → parallel
