Yes, T5 can fire before T3.

A shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3 is:

1. **T1**  
   - p0→0, pa→1, pb→1

2. **T2b**  
   - pa→0, pd→1

3. **T4**  
   - pb→0, pe→1

4. **T5**  
   - consumes pd and pe, produces pf→1

At this point, **T5 has fired and T3 has not yet fired**, so T5 fired before T3 in this reachable marking.
