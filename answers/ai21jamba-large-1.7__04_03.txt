**No**, trace 2025-05-RX17 **is not compliant** with ruleset R. Below is the analysis of the rules' satisfaction or violations:

1. **Rule 1**: Both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) **and** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur **once each and in that order**.
	- **Violation**: QE occurs before RA, but RA is incorrectly placed **after** `Notify_Authorities` (NA), violating the required order of occurrence and the requirement that both reviews must occur before NA.
2. **Rule 2**: If the case-level attribute **severity = "High"**, activity `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must happen **after both QE and RA**.
	- **Violation**: VP occurs **before** RA, which is not allowed when `severity = "High"`.
3. **Rule 3**: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must **not occur until after** QE **and** RA are complete.
	- **Violation**: NA occurs **before** RA, thereby violating this rule.
4. **Rule 4**: `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only **after** NA (and, if required by rule 2, after VP).
	- **Satisfied**: CC occurs after NA and VP; however, since the earlier rules are violated, this point is moot.

In summary, the trace fails to uphold Rules 1, 2, and 3, making it non-compliant.
