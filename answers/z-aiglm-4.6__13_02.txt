2.  The percentage of events and cases including that activity is:

3.  Low-support activities like “Manual_Fraud_Check” can mislead analyses because they lack statistical significance. With only one instance, its performance metrics (e.g., processing time) are not representative and may be an outlier. Predictive models could overfit, creating a spurious correlation between this activity and the subsequent “Approve_Payout.” Generalising from this single case to the broader process is unreliable and could lead to flawed operational decisions or inaccurate forecasts for future claims.
