## Audit Report — Case #47291

### Rule-by-Rule Analysis

| Rule | Result | Justification |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **R1** | **Compliant** | €12,450 > €10,000; Manager_Approval (event 2) correctly precedes Finance_Approval (event 3). |
| **R2** | **Compliant** | Finance_Approval on March 4; Ship_Goods on March 5 — one calendar day, within the two-day limit. |
| **R3** | **Violated** | Pay_Invoice timestamp (2025-03-06 09:00) is **24 hours earlier** than Receive_Goods (2025-03-07 14:13). |
| **R4** | **Not Applicable** | hazardous = false; Safety_Inspection requirement is not triggered. |
| **R5** | **Violated** | Change_Request (event 4, March 4 15:42) occurred post-approval; Ship_Goods (event 5, March 5) proceeded without the new Manager_Approval, which only arrived at event 8 (March 7). |
| **R6** | **Compliant** | Archive_Record is the final event (event 10); case terminates correctly. |

### Key Findings

- **R3 Violation:** The event-list numbering is misleading. Comparing actual timestamps, Pay_Invoice (March 6) was executed a full day *before* Receive_Goods (March 7) — a strict prohibition.
- **R5 Violation:** The Change_Request after Finance_Approval invalidated all further processing until a new Manager_Approval was obtained. Events 5 (Ship_Goods), 6 (Receive_Goods), and 7 (Pay_Invoice) all proceeded unlawfully before the new Manager_Approval at event 8.
