**Parallel pairs in Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder**

```
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Procure_Materials     —  Schedule_Machines
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Procure_Materials & Schedule_Machines** both start immediately after *Create_Work_Order* and run simultaneously until the synchronisation point before *Fabricate*.
- **Create_Documentation & Quality_Check** both start immediately after *Fabricate* and run simultaneously until the synchronisation point before *Package*.

No other task pairs in Process B can overlap: every other combination is separated by a strict sequential dependency (e.g., *Fabricate* must finish before either *Quality_Check* or *Create_Documentation* can begin; *Package* must finish before *Dispatch_to_Customer*, etc.).
