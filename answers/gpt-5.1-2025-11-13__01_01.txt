   - **Decision:** Is the refund amount greater than €1 000, requiring the high‑value branch?  
   - **Documents used:**

   - **Decision:** Does the senior auditor approve the high‑value refund?  
   - **Documents used:**
     - *AuditTrail*

5. **Process_Refund_Payment** (gatekeeping via constraints)  
   - **Decision:** Can the payment be executed now?  
   - **Conditions (process constraints):**
     - **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** must have succeeded.  
     - For high‑value claims, **Senior_Auditor_Review** must have been completed.
