**Answer 1:** **No**, it is not possible for transition **T5** to fire before **T3**.

**Answer 2 (Bonus):**  
Transition **T5** requires tokens in both **P2** and **P5** to fire.  
**P2** receives a token from **T1**, and **P5** is reached only after passing through transitions: **T1** → **T2** → **T7** → **T4**—this moves a token from **P1** to **P3** to **P4** to **P5**.  
However, transition **T3** consumes the token from **P2** to move it to **P4** before **T5** could fire.  
Since **T3** uses up the token in **P2**, **T5** can only fire if **T3** does not fire—which is conflicting.  
Thus, **T5 cannot fire before T3**; it depends on **P2** still holding a token.
