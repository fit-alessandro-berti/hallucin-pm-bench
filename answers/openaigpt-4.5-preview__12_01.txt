No, the provided fact is not accurate according to the event-log fragment.  

Justification (citing specifics from event-log):

- **Case 1001**: "Update_Inventory" occurs at 08:25:55, **before** "Authorize_Refund," which occurs at 08:30:02. 
- **Case 1003**: "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, **before** "Authorize_Refund," which occurs at 10:22:18.

Thus, the claim that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" is contradicted by the order of activities in cases 1001 and 1003.
