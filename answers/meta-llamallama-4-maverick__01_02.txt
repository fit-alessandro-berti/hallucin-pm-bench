Based on the Micro-loan Fast-Track process, the decision points are:

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: Decide whether to continue or escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** based on the difference between the two risk scores assigned by **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**.
2. **Amount Threshold Decision**: Determine whether to auto-approve (if amount < €15 000) or proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** (if amount ≥ €15 000).
3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: The Micro-loan Board votes to approve or reject the loan (for amounts ≥ €15 000).

The required documents at submission time are:
1. **Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)**
2. **Proof of Address** (≤ 3 months old)
3. **Latest Income Statement** (single pay-stub or tax slip)
4. **Community Impact Statement (CIS)** template
5. **Dual Underwriter Score-Sheet**
6. **Neighbourhood Feedback Form (NFF)**
