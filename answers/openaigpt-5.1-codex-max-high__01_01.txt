The process contains a few key decisions:

- In **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**, the agent determines whether the claim is eligible by checking it against the *FlightManifest* and the *WeatherReport*.
- In **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**, the controller decides whether to sign off on the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*.
- A branching decision occurs after pre-approval: if the refund amount is greater than €1 000, the case must go through **Senior_Auditor_Review** (including the *AuditTrail*) before proceeding; lower-value claims skip this review.

Across these steps, the required documents and artefacts are:

- *RefundRequestForm* submitted by the customer.
- *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport* for eligibility validation.
- *EligibilityChecklist* for finance pre-approval.
- *AuditTrail* for high-value cases in the senior audit review.
- *BankTransferAuthorization* to execute the refund payment.
- *RefundConfirmationPDF* generated and emailed as confirmation.
