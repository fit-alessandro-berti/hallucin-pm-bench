We need to analyze the given safe Petri net.

Places: p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

Transitions:

T1: p0 → p1 + p2 (parallel split). So firing T1 consumes token from p0, produces token in p1 and p2.

T2: p1 → p3 (p1 token moves to p3)

T3: p2 → p4 (p2 token moves to p4)

T4: p3 + p4 → p5 (synchronising join). Consumes tokens from p3 and p4, puts token in p5.

T5: p3 –|p4 → p6 (inhibitor arc from p4). Means T5 requires token in p3 (normal arc) and p4 has zero tokens (inhibitor). So T5 can fire when there is token in p3 and no token in p4. It consumes token from p3, puts token in p6. Note: The inhibitor does not consume token from p4; it's a condition.

We need to answer: Is it possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3? In any reachable marking, is T5 fireable before T3? If yes, provide a concrete firing sequence from the initial marking. If no, give proof.

We need to examine reachable markings and firing possibilities. Initially, p0 has token. T1 is enabled (p0 token). No other transition is enabled initially because p1 and p2 are empty.

After firing T1, p0 token removed, p1 gets token, p2 gets token. So marking M1: p1=1, p2=1.

From M1, T2 and T3 are enabled (p1 and p2 each have token). T2: p1→p3. T3: p2→p4.

Thus we have two possible sequences: T2 then T3, or T3 then T2, or interleaved with T4 if both p3 and p4 tokens exist.

We need to see if T5 can fire before T3. T5 requires p3 token and p4 empty. So we need a marking where p3 token exists, p4 empty, and T5 can fire.

From M1, we can fire T2 first, producing p3 token, p4 remains empty (since T3 hasn't fired). So after firing T2, we have p3 token (p3=1), p1 token is removed, p2 token remains (p2=1). So marking M2: p3=1, p2=1.

Now T5 is enabled? Yes: p3 token exists, p4 is empty (no token in p4). So T5 can fire before T3. So the answer is yes. Provide a concrete firing sequence: T1, T2, then T5.

But we must verify that T5 doesn't require p4 token? The inhibitor arc means T5 is enabled only if p4 contains zero tokens. So we must ensure p4 is empty. In M2, p4 is indeed empty because we haven't fired T3. So T5 can fire.

Thus sequence: T1 (p0→p1+p2), T2 (p1→p3), T5 (p3→p6). After that, we have p2 token still in p2, p6 token in p6. Then we could fire T3 (p2→p4) and T4 if desired.

Thus answer: Yes, T5 can fire before T3, with sequence T1, T2, T5.

Now we need to justify briefly. Provide explanation: After T1, we have tokens in p1 and p2. Firing T2 moves token from p1 to p3, leaving p2 token unchanged. At this point p3 token present, p4 empty, satisfying T5's enabling condition (p3 token, p4 empty). So T5 can fire before T3.

Alternatively, we could also consider T5 after T1 and T2 but before T3.

Thus answer: Yes, possible.

We also need to ensure that the net is safe, but that's fine.

Thus answer: Provide sequence: T1, T2, T5.

Now we must produce final answer with brief justification.

Potentially we can also discuss that T5 cannot fire before T2 because p3 must have token, and T2 is the only transition that produces token in p3. So T5 cannot fire before T2, but can fire after T2 and before T3.

Thus answer: Yes, as shown.

Now we can also discuss proof of impossibility if the answer were no. But it's yes.

Thus final answer: Yes, T5 can fire before T3. Provide sequence: T1, T2, T5.

Add brief justification.

Now produce final answer.

**Answer: Yes.**  

A concrete firing sequence that lets T5 fire before T3 is

```
T1 → T2 → T5
```

**Why it works**

1. **T1** (parallel split)  
   - Consumes the token in p0 and produces one token in p1 and one token in p2.  
   - After T1 the marking is: p1 = 1, p2 = 1 (all other places empty).

2. **T2** (p1 → p3)  
   - Consumes the token in p1 and puts a token in p3.  
   - Marking after T2: p3 = 1, p2 = 1 (p4 is still empty).

3. **T5** (p3 –|p4 → p6)  
   - The transition is enabled because:
     * it sees a token in p3 (normal arc), **and**
     * place p4 contains **zero** tokens (inhibitor arc).  
   - Firing T5 consumes the token from p3 and produces a token in p6.  
   - After T5 the marking is: p2 = 1, p6 = 1 (p4 remains empty).

Thus, in this reachable marking T5 has already fired, while T3 (which would move the token from p2 to p4) has not yet been enabled. Hence **T5 can fire before T3**.  

*No further condition prevents this; the only requirement for T5 is that p4 be empty, which is satisfied as long as T3 (the only transition that puts a token in p4) has not fired.*
