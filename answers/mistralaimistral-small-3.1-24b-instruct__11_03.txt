Period: Most recent data

Subject: Process Performance for Loan Activities

Three activities stand out as the worst performers, based on both SLA breaches and high waiting times. These are:

1. **Legal Approval**
   • Exceeds SLA: 300s
   • High waiting time: 600s
   • This excessive time poses a significant bottleneck. **Continuously engage a cross-functional team to streamline approval workflows and reduce decision-point delays.**

2. **Risk Review**
   • Exceeds SLA: 300s
   • Significant waiting time: 480s
   • The prolonged time needed reduces efficiency and could be compounding customer dissatisfaction. **Perform a detailed analysis of the review process, to prioritize repetitive tasks for automation or workflow reengineering.**

3. **Credit Assessment**
   • **Exceeds SLA by 60s**
   • Moderate waiting time: 200s
   • The collectively latter stages of this activity are the key limiting factor in performance delays. **Implement regularly updated, predictive analytics to expedite the assessment process.**
