### Answer:
**No**

### Justification:
The FACT claims that "Validate_Payment" **always** occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between. However, the log excerpt shows two violations:  

1. **Case C002**:  
   - Sequence: `Receive_Order` (2025-01-03T09:30:00) → `Pack_Items` (2025-01-03T09:50:00) → `Validate_Payment` (2025-01-03T10:05:00).  
   - Here, `Pack_Items` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, violating the "immediately after" requirement.  

2. **Case C004**:  
   - Sequence: `Receive_Order` (2025-01-03T10:05:00) → `Check_Fraud` (2025-01-03T10:07:00) → `Validate_Payment` (2025-01-03T10:20:00).  
   - `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, violating the FACT.  

While Cases C001 and C003 comply with the FACT (e.g., C001: `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment`), the exceptions in C002 and C004 disprove the universal claim ("always"). Thus, the FACT is **inaccurate** based on the provided log.
