Answer: No

Justification: While Validate_Payment follows Receive_Order in cases C001 (lines 1-2), C004 (lines 8-9), and C005 (lines 11-12), this is not true for all cases. In case C002 (lines 3-5), Validate_Payment follows Check_Inventory rather than Receive_Order. In case C003 (lines 6-7), Validate_Payment occurs *before* Receive_Order, violating the stated order entirely.
