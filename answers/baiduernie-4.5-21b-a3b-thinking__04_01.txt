Non-compliant  
Justification:  
- **Violation of Rule 2**: The trace contains an `Expedite_Flag` (activity ID 4), which requires that `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Risk_Assessment` occurs at ID 9, while `Ship_Goods` occurs at ID 8 (based on timestamps, ID 8 is earlier than ID 9). Thus, `Risk_Assessment` does not occur before `Ship_Goods`, violating rule 2.  
- **Violation of Rule 3**: After `Goods_Received` (activity ID 6), `Three_way_match` (activity ID 10) must occur within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The activities following `Goods_Received` are:  
  - ID 7 (`Move_to_Quality`): distance 1  
  - ID 8 (`Ship_Goods`): distance 2  
  - ID 9 (`Risk_Assessment`): distance 3  
  - ID 10 (`Three_way_match`): distance 4  
  Since `Three_way_match` at distance 4 exceeds the required ≤ 2, rule 3 is violated.  
- **Rule 1 Compliance**: Although the PO amount (€12,300) exceeds the threshold, the required approvals (first by a `Procurement_Officer` at ID 2, then by the `CFO` at ID 3) occur before `Issue_PO` (activity ID 5), so rule 1 is satisfied.  
- **Rule 4 Compliance**: No `Intern` activity directly follows a `CFO` activity. The `CFO` activity is at ID 3, and the next `Intern` activity is at ID 7, with other activities (ID 4 and ID 5) in between, so rule 4 is satisfied.  
- **Rule 5 Compliance**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (activity ID 11) and contains no subsequent activities, so rule 5 is satisfied.  

The trace violates rules 2 and 3, making it non-compliant with the rule set.
