MEMORANDUM

**TO**: COO, Orion Credit
**FROM**: Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE**: October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT**: Process Performance Analysis

This memo highlights three activities significantly impacting our operational performance.

*   **Legal Approval** exhibits the most significant SLA breach, with average throughput time (900s) exceeding the target SLA (600s) by 300s. This activity also has a high average waiting time of 600s. To address this, I recommend:

    *   **Analyze the Legal Approval process to identify bottlenecks and implement strategies to reduce the time spent on each case.**
*   **Risk Review** also demonstrates poor performance. Its average throughput time (600s) exceeds the SLA (300s) by 300s and has an average waiting time of 480s. I recommend:

    *   **Optimize the Risk Review process by identifying and addressing the root causes that lead to excessive waiting times.**
*   **Credit Assessment** has an average throughput time (300s) that exceeds the target SLA (240s) by 60s, with an average waiting time of 200s. I recommend:

    *   **Introduce process improvements to minimize the average waiting time by optimizing resource allocation or process design.**
