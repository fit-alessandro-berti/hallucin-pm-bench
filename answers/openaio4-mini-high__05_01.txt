Attach non‐interrupting boundary timer events (timerDefinition=PT48H) to both Task_Check (id=Task_Check) and Task_RequestDocs (id=Task_RequestDocs).  From each timer event add a new sequenceFlow straight into Task_Triage (id=Task_Triage).  That way, if a claim lingers in completeness‐check or awaiting docs for more than 48 hours, it auto‐escalates directly into “Triage Claim,” satisfying the SLA without adding any new tasks.
