Based **strictly** on the provided process description (non-standard variant) and constraints, here is the summary:

### **Decision Points**  
1. **High-Value Refund Check** (at step 4):  
   - Condition: **Is the refund amount > €1,000?**  
   - Outcome:  
     - **Yes** → Proceed to *Senior_Auditor_Review* (mandatory, with *AuditTrail*).  
     - **No** → Skip *Senior_Auditor_Review*; proceed directly to *Process_Refund_Payment*.  

*Note:* No other decision points exist per the description. Steps 2 (*Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*) and 3 (*Finance_Controller_PreApprove*) are **validation/sign-off activities**, not decision points (they lack conditional branching per the defined process). The textbook activity "CustomerService_Agent_Decide" is explicitly excluded.

### **Required Documents**  
Listed in order of appearance in the process:  
1. **RefundRequestForm** (submitted by passenger in *Customer_Submit_Claim*).  
2. **FlightManifest** (used by triage agent in *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*).  
3. **WeatherReport** (used by triage agent in *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*).  
4. **EligibilityChecklist** (signed by finance controller in *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*).  
5. **AuditTrail** (required **only** for high-value claims > €1,000 during *Senior_Auditor_Review*).  
6. **BankTransferAuthorization** (signed document required before *Process_Refund_Payment* can begin).  

*Note:* The **RefundConfirmationPDF** (step 6) is an **output artefact**, not a required input document for process execution. No other documents are defined in the process.  

### Key Compliance Notes  
- **AuditTrail** is conditional (only for refunds > €1,000) but **mandatory** when triggered.  
- **BankTransferAuthorization** must be signed and present before payment (per constraints).  
- No documents associated with excluded activities (e.g., "CustomerService_Agent_Decide") are valid.  
- All listed documents are **explicitly named** in the process steps or constraints.
