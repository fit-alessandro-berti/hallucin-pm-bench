R1. Compliant. PO amount (€12,450) > €10,000 and Manager/Finance approval sequence was followed.

R3. Compliant. Pay_Invoice occurred after Receive_Goods, fulfilling the requirement.
R4. Not Applicable. Hazardous = false, so Safety_Inspection isn't required.
R5. Compliant. Change_Request happened after approval, and a new Manager_Approval was obtained.
R6. Compliant. The case terminates with Archive_Record.
