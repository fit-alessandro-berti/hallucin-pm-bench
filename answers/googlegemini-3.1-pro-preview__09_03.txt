I cannot compute the average cycle time, the standard deviation, or the 95% confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity. 

I am unable to calculate these metrics because the provided Event-Log Stub (Artefact A) has had every row and timestamp explicitly redacted, leaving only the column headers. To compute cycle times, standard deviations, and confidence intervals for a specific activity, I must have the mathematical values from the "start_time" and "complete_time" fields for each instance of "Approve Invoice." Furthermore, the SLA Catalogue (Artefact B) only provides a historical average representing the duration between two distinct events ("Approve Invoice" and "Pay Invoice"), which cannot be used to deduce the execution cycle time of the standalone "Approve Invoice" activity itself. Without the underlying log data, any metric calculation is impossible.
