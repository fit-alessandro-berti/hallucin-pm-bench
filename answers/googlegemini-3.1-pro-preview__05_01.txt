To meet the SLA without adding any new tasks or subprocesses, attach an **interrupting Timer Boundary Event** to **`Task_RequestDocs`** (the expected bottleneck), configured to trigger if the 48-hour limit from **`Start_Claim`** is reached. Route the sequence flow from this timer event directly to a newly introduced **Escalation End Event**. 

Because waiting for external documents is the only unbounded delay before **`Task_Triage`**, this solution automatically aborts the wait state if the SLA is breached. The claim is then routed to the Escalation End Event, fulfilling the "auto-escalate" requirement (handled by the parent process or system engine) natively in BPMN 2.0.
