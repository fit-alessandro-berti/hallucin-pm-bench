## Decision points in Contoso’s flight-refund process

1. **Eligibility decision (during Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility)**
   - **Decision:** Is the claim eligible when checked against the flight and disruption evidence?
   - **Basis/Documents used:** *FlightManifest*, *WeatherReport* (claim originates from the submitted *RefundRequestForm*).

2. **Pre-approval decision (Finance_Controller_PreApprove)**
   - **Decision:** Does the finance controller approve the refund based on the required checklist?
   - **Basis/Documents used:** *EligibilityChecklist*.

3. **High-value branching decision (after Finance_Controller_PreApprove)**
   - **Decision:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1 000**?
     - **Yes:** Must proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (and that review must include the *AuditTrail*).
     - **No:** Skip **Senior_Auditor_Review** and proceed toward payment.
   - **Basis/Documents used (for the high-value path):** *AuditTrail*.

4. **Payment readiness gate (before/during Process_Refund_Payment)**
   - **Decision/Condition:** Can payment execution begin?
   - **Required conditions/documents:**
     - **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** must have succeeded; and for high-value claims, **Senior_Auditor_Review** must be completed.
     - The signed *BankTransferAuthorization* must be present.
