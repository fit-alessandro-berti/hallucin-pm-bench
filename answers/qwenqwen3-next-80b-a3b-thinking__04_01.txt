Non-compliant

1. Rule 2 violation: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), so `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8, and `Risk_Assessment` occurs at event #9 (after), which violates the rule.

2. Rule 3 violation: After `Goods_Received` (event #6), `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (i.e., at event #7 or #8). However, `Three_way_match` occurs at event #10, which is beyond the next two activities, violating the rule.
