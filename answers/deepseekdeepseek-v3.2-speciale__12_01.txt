The fact is **not accurate**.

- **Case 1001** contains both activities, but the order is `Update_Inventory` (08:25:55) → `Authorize_Refund` (08:30:02). `Authorize_Refund` does **not** occur immediately before `Update_Inventory`; it occurs after.
- **Case 1003** also contains both, with `Update_Inventory` occurring before `Authorize_Refund`, and `Quality_Check` in between, so they are not consecutive in the required order.
- **Case 1002** has `Authorize_Refund` but no `Update_Inventory` at all, further contradicting the claim that `Authorize_Refund` always occurs immediately before `Update_Inventory`.

No case in the fragment supports the claimed pattern.
