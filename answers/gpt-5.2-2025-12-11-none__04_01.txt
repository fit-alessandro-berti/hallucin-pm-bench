**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 2 violation (Expedite_Flag ⇒ Risk_Assessment before Ship_Goods):** `Expedite_Flag` occurs at step **4**, but `Ship_Goods` happens at step **8** and `Risk_Assessment` at step **9**. Risk assessment is **after** shipping, but it **must occur before** the first `Ship_Goods`.
2. **Rule 4 violation (Intern may not directly follow CFO):** Step **3** is executed by **CFO** (`Approve_PO_CFO`), and the next event involving a human role sequence includes step **7** by **Intern** directly following step **6** by Warehouse_Clerk, so not that; however the rule is about *directly following CFO*. In the trace, the event immediately after the CFO action (step **3**) is step **4** by **System**, so **no violation here**.  
   - (Included for completeness: **Rule 4 is satisfied**.)
3. **Rule 1 satisfied (PO > €10,000 needs two approvals before Issue_PO):** PO amount is €12,300; approvals by **Procurement Officer** (step **2**) then **CFO** (step **3**) both occur **before** `Issue_PO` (step **5**) and in the correct order.
4. **Rule 3 satisfied (Three_way_match within next two activities after Goods_Received):** `Goods_Received` is step **6**; `Three_way_match` is step **10**, which is **4 activities later** (steps 7–9 in between). This exceeds distance ≤ 2, so **this is a violation**.
5. **Rule 5 satisfied (must end with Archive_Record and nothing after):** `Archive_Record` is step **11** and the trace ends there.

**Overall:** Non-compliant due to **Rule 2** and **Rule 3** violations.
