Okay, let's tackle this task step by step. First, I need to understand the informal process description provided and then convert it into a RACI table using the mandated vocabulary. 

The original process has six steps. Let's go through each one and identify the roles and responsibilities involved. The user has specified that we must use "KYC Review" instead of "Customer Due Diligence", "Regulatory Liaison" instead of "Compliance Officer", and "Transaction Analyst" instead of "Payment Clerk" or similar terms.

Starting with step 1: A payment clerk receives the transfer instruction and logs it. According to the mandate, "payment clerk" becomes "Transaction Analyst". So, the Transaction Analyst is responsible for receiving and logging the instruction.

Step 2: The clerk screens against the sanctions list. Again, Transaction Analyst is the role here. Responsible for screening.

Step 3: A compliance officer performs the customer due diligence check. This should be "Regulatory Liaison" performing the "KYC Review". So, Regulatory Liaison is responsible for the KYC Review.

Step 4: If the transaction is high-risk, the compliance officer must approve it. Here, the Regulatory Liaison is accountable for approving high-risk transactions.

Step 5: Once approved, the clerk releases the payment, and IT Support sends the SWIFT message. Transaction Analyst releases the payment, and IT Support is responsible for sending the SWIFT message. However, the original description mentions IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent, so IT Support is responsible. But in the RACI table, we need to assign roles from the given list. Wait, the user didn't mention IT Support in the vocabulary, but the original process includes it. Hmm, the task says to use only the mandated terms for roles. Since IT Support isn't listed, maybe we should omit it or see if it's part of another role. But the problem statement doesn't provide an alternative for IT Support. The user might expect us to include it as is, even though it's not in the vocabulary. Let me check the task again. The task says to use only the mandated terms for activities and roles. So IT Support isn't part of the roles provided. Maybe the user expects IT Support to be included as is, but in the RACI table, we need to list roles as per the mandate. Wait, the original roles to use are Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison. IT Support isn't one of them. So perhaps the user expects IT Support to be part of another role or to be left out? But the process description includes IT Support. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the user wants us to include IT Support as is, even though it's not part of the mandated roles. Let me proceed with including IT Support as a role, since it's part of the original process.

Step 6: IT Support archives the case file, and the compliance officer is notified. So IT Support is responsible for archiving, and Regulatory Liaison is informed.

Now, let's map each task to the RACI table:

1. Receive and log transfer instruction: Transaction Analyst (Responsible), maybe Regulatory Liaison (Accountable)? Or is Transaction Analyst both Responsible and Accountable? The account holder (Accountable) would typically be the one ensuring the task is done. So Transaction Analyst is Responsible, maybe Regulatory Liaison is Accountable? Or is the Accountable role the head of the department? The problem statement doesn't specify, but in RACI, Accountable is usually a single person or role. Since the process involves sending payments, maybe the Transaction Analyst is Accountable for logging, but Regulatory Liaison is Accountable for the overall process steps they are involved in. Hmm, need to clarify.

Wait, RACI definitions:
- Responsible: Who does the work
- Accountable: Who is ultimately answerable for the task
- Consulted: Who is consulted before a decision
- Informed: Who is kept updated

So for step 1: Transaction Analyst does the work (Responsible), and maybe Regulatory Liaison is Accountable? Or is Transaction Analyst Accountable? It's a bit ambiguous. But typically, the person doing the task is Responsible, and someone else is Accountable. However, in this case, since it's a straightforward task, maybe Transaction Analyst is both Responsible and Accountable. But I need to check the other steps.

Step 2: Screening against sanctions list - Transaction Analyst (Responsible), Accountable could be Regulatory Liaison? Or Transaction Analyst is Accountable here as well.

Step 3: KYC Review - Regulatory Liaison (Responsible and Accountable)

Step 4: Approval for high-risk - Regulatory Liaison (Responsible and Accountable)

Step 5: Release payment - Transaction Analyst (Responsible), IT Support (Responsible for sending SWIFT), Accountable might be Regulatory Liaison or Transaction Analyst.

Step 6: Archive case file - IT Support (Responsible), Informed: Regulatory Liaison.

Now, let's structure the RACI table. The roles are Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support (though IT Support isn't in the mandated roles, but included here as per the process).

But the user specified to use only the mandated terms for roles. So IT Support should not be included. Wait, the task says to use only the mandated terms for activities and roles. The roles to use are Transaction Analyst and Regulatory Liaison. IT Support is not part of the mandated roles. Therefore, the user expects us to omit IT Support from the RACI table? But the process description includes IT Support. This is a problem. How to handle this?

The user might have missed including IT Support in the mandated roles, but the task says to follow the vocabulary strictly. Therefore, perhaps IT Support is not part of the roles in the RACI table. But then, how to represent the tasks involving IT Support? Maybe the user expects us to assume that IT Support is part of another role, but that's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the user wants us to include IT Support as is, even though it's not in the mandated roles. But the task says to use only the mandated terms. This is conflicting.

Given the strict instruction to use only the mandated terms (Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison), I will proceed without IT Support in the RACI table. However, the original process description includes IT Support. This means that the tasks related to IT Support (steps 5 and 6) need to be handled with the available roles. But since IT Support isn't a mandated role, perhaps those tasks are not included in the RACI table, or they are assigned to an existing role. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user expects us to include IT Support as a role, even though it's not mandated. But the task says to follow the vocabulary strictly. This is a dilemma.

Wait, the task says: "use *only* the mandated terms above for activities and roles." So IT Support is not a mandated role. Therefore, we should not include it in the RACI table. But the process description mentions IT Support. How to resolve this? Maybe the user expects us to assume that IT Support is part of another role, but that's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in not including IT Support in the mandated roles. But as a consultant following the task, I must adhere to the instructions strictly.

Therefore, I will proceed by removing IT Support from the RACI table and focus on the mandated roles. However, this means that steps 5 and 6, which involve IT Support, will not be represented in the RACI table. But the user wants every task covered. This is a problem. Maybe the user expects us to include IT Support as a role, even though it's not mandated. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants us to assign those tasks to an existing role. For example, Transaction Analyst could be responsible for sending the SWIFT message, but that's not accurate according to the process description. The process says IT Support does that. So this is a conflict.

Given the strict instructions, I will have to exclude IT Support from the RACI table, even though it appears in the process description. Therefore, the RACI table will only include Transaction Analyst and Regulatory Liaison. But then, steps 5 and 6 won't be covered. This doesn't meet the user's requirement to cover every task. Alternatively, maybe the user intended for IT Support to be part of another role, but that's not specified. 

This is a challenging situation. Since the task requires using only the mandated terms, and IT Support is not one of them, I will proceed by including IT Support as a role, even though it's not in the mandated list. The user might have overlooked this, but the process description includes it. Therefore, I will create a RACI table with Transaction Analyst, Regulatory Liaison, and IT Support, even though IT Support isn't in the mandated roles. The user might need to be informed later, but as per the task, I must follow the instructions strictly, which includes covering every task.

So, proceeding with the RACI table including IT Support.

Now, let's create the table:

| Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| 1. Receive and log instruction | R | A | I |
| 2. Screen against sanctions | R | A | I |
| 3. Perform KYC Review | C | R, A | I |
| 4. Approve high-risk transaction | C | R, A | I |
| 5. Release payment and send SWIFT | R | A | R |
| 6. Archive case file and notify | I | R | R, A |

Wait, but according to the process description:

Step 1: Transaction Analyst receives and logs (R), Regulatory Liaison is Accountable (A), IT Support is Informed (I).

Step 2: Transaction Analyst screens (R), Regulatory Liaison is Accountable (A), IT Support is Informed (I).

Step 3: Regulatory Liaison performs KYC Review (R, A), Transaction Analyst is Consulted (C), IT Support is Informed (I).

Step 4: Regulatory Liaison approves (R, A), Transaction Analyst is Consulted (C), IT Support is Informed (I).

Step 5: Transaction Analyst releases payment (R), IT Support sends SWIFT (R), Regulatory Liaison is Accountable (A), IT Support is Accountable for sending SWIFT? Or Regulatory Liaison is Accountable for the overall process. Maybe Regulatory Liaison is Accountable for steps 1-4 and 6, and Transaction Analyst is Accountable for step 1 and 2, and IT Support is Accountable for step 5 and 6.

Step 6: IT Support archives (R, A), Regulatory Liaison is Informed (I).

Adjusting the table:

| Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| 1. Receive and log instruction | R | A | I |
| 2. Screen against sanctions | R | A | I |
| 3. Perform KYC Review | C | R, A | I |
| 4. Approve high-risk transaction | C | R, A | I |
| 5. Release payment and send SWIFT | R | A | R |
| 6. Archive case file | I | I | R, A |

But step 5 and 6 involve IT Support. However, according to the process, Regulatory Liaison is notified in step 6, so they are Informed.

This seems to cover all tasks. Let's verify:

- Transaction Analyst is Responsible for receiving, logging, screening, releasing.
- Regulatory Liaison is Accountable for steps 1-4 and Informed in step 6.
- IT Support is Responsible for sending SWIFT and archiving, Accountable for archiving.

This aligns with the process description. Now, converting this into markdown format.
| Task | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|
| 1. Receive and log transfer instruction | **R** | **A** | I |
| 2. Screen payment against sanctions list | **R** | **A** | I |
| 3. Perform KYC Review | C | **R, A** | I |
| 4. Approve high-risk transaction | C | **R, A** | I |
| 5. Release payment and send SWIFT message | **R** | **A** | **R** |
| 6. Archive case file and notify | I | I | **R, A** |

R = Responsible | A = Accountable | C = Consulted | I = Informed

This RACI table maps the informal process to formal roles following the mandated vocabulary. Note that steps involving IT Support (sending SWIFT message and archiving) are included as they represent crucial tasks in the payment process, even though IT Support isn't part of the mandated vocabulary. The Transaction Analyst handles operational tasks, the Regulatory Liaison oversees compliance and approval steps, and IT Support ensures technical execution of payment processes.
