Yes, transition **T5** can fire before transition **T3** in this Petri net. Here is a concrete firing sequence demonstrating this:

### Firing Sequence:
1. **T1** fires:  
   - Consumes 1 token from **p0**, produces 1 token in **p1** and **p2**.  
   - **Marking**: p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0.

2. **T2** fires:  
   - Consumes 1 token from **p1**, produces 1 token in **p3**.  
   - **Marking**: p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0.

3. **T5** fires:  
   - Enabled because **p3** has 1 token (normal arc) and **p4** has 0 tokens (inhibitor arc).  
   - Consumes 1 token from **p3**, produces 1 token in **p6**.  
   - **Marking**: p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=1.

### Justification:
- **T5** requires **p3** to have a token and **p4** to be empty.  
- After **T1** and **T2**, **p3** has a token, and **p4** remains empty (since **T3** has not fired yet).  
- Thus, **T5** can fire before **T3**.  

This sequence shows that **T5** can indeed fire prior to **T3** in a reachable marking. 

**Answer: Yes.**  
**Sequence:** T1 → T2 → T5.
