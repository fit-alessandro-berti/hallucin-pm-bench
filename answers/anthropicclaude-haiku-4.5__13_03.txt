## 2️⃣ Why This Snippet May Mislead

An analyst viewing only this excerpt risks **sampling bias**:

- **Insufficient volume**: 14 events across 3 cases is too small to establish reliable prevalence rates. Manual fraud checks appear in 33% of cases here, but March-wide data might show 5% or 50%.
- **Temporal clustering**: This snippet captures only March 1st morning—fraud-check patterns may vary by day, week, or application volume.
- **Case selection unknown**: We don't know if these 3 cases are representative. They might be edge cases triggering manual review more frequently than typical applications.
- **Activity naming inconsistency**: Note "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"—the full log may use varied terminology, affecting counts.

**Conclusion**: Extrapolating from this snippet alone risks significant overestimation or underestimation of manual fraud-check frequency across the full month.
