It is not possible to compute the average cycle time of **“Review Contract”** with the data provided.

**Reason:**  
The event log excerpt you provided contains only `case_id`, `activity`, and `resource`. All timestamps and elapsed-time fields have been redacted, and there is no other duration information for **“Review Contract”** in this log. Without start/end times or durations, cycle time cannot be derived.  

We therefore cannot calculate the requested value.
