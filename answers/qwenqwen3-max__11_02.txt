Three activities significantly underperform:  

1. **Request_Documents**: Exceptionally high rework (22.0%) and long wait time (150 min) indicate inefficient initial requests, causing repeated document chases. *Action:* Redesign the request template and automate completeness checks at submission to reduce repeat requests.  

2. **Review_Documents**: Highest SLA breach (12.4%) and processing time variability (stdev = 9 min) suggest inconsistent reviewer workloads or unclear standards. *Action:* Standardize review criteria and implement workload-balancing rules to stabilize processing times.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**: Elevated SLA breaches (3.2%) and rework (1.8%)—notable given its early stage—imply assessment errors propagate downstream. *Action:* Introduce a quick-validation checkpoint post-assessment to catch and correct errors before handoff.  

All other activities perform within acceptable thresholds (rework <1%, SLA breaches <1.5%). Addressing these three bottlenecks will disproportionately improve end-to-end cycle time and compliance.
