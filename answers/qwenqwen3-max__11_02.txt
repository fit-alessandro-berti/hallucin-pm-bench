**Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Bottleneck Alert**

Three activities are critically underperforming:  

1. **Request_Documents** — Lowest throughput (190/day) and massive 150-min wait time. 22% rework suggests unclear requests.  
→ *Action: Redesign request templates and auto-validate completeness before submission to cut rework and queueing.*  

2. **Review_Documents** — High processing time (25 min) with large variability (9 min stdev) and 12.4% SLA breaches. 5.3% rework implies inconsistent reviews.  
→ *Action: Implement standardized checklists and peer calibration sessions to reduce variation and rework.*  

3. **Initial_Assessment** — 18-min wait and 3.2% SLA breach rate — second-highest after Review_Documents. Rising rework (1.8%) may be inflating delays.  
→ *Action: Allocate 2 temporary FTEs for 60 days to clear backlog and analyze root causes of rework triggers.*

These three drive downstream delays. Prioritize Request_Documents first — its wait time is 8x the next worst.
