1. **No.**

2. **Justification (by CaseID and sequence):**
- **C001:** `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  - Here, **Validate_Payment is immediately after Receive_Order**.
- **C002:** `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  - **Pack_Items occurs in between**, so **Validate_Payment is not immediately after Receive_Order**.
- **C003:** `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order`  
  - Here, **Validate_Payment is immediately after Receive_Order**.
- **C004:** `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  - **Check_Fraud occurs in between**, so **Validate_Payment is not immediately after Receive_Order**.

Since **C002 and C004** violate the “immediately after” condition, the FACT is **not accurate** for this excerpt.
