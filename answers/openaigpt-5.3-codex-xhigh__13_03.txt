1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** appears **1 time**.

2️⃣ An analyst could misestimate because this excerpt is very small and time-limited: **14 events**, **3 cases (1001–1003)**, all between **2025-03-01 09:02:11Z and 10:45:00Z**. That is not the month-long population. Also, the snippet already shows label variation in fraud-check activities (**“Automatic Fraud Check”** vs **“Fraud Check (Automatic)”**), so exact-string counting is sensitive to naming differences. Finally, some activities repeat within a case (e.g., **Send Offer** in 1001, **Approve Application** in 1003), so event counts and case-level prevalence are not the same.
