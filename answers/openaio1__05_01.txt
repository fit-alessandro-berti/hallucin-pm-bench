Add a boundary timer event (e.g., “Timer_48h”) to Task_RequestDocs (id="Task_RequestDocs") that fires 48 hours after the Start_Claim event (id="Start_Claim"). This timer should interrupt Task_RequestDocs if the missing documents are still outstanding and immediately flow to Task_Triage (id="Task_Triage"). That way, even if document gathering stalls, the claim proceeds to Triage within 48 hours, meeting the SLA. You are not creating a new task—only an interrupting boundary event (with a 48-hour timer definition) on Task_RequestDocs and redirecting the flow to Task_Triage when time expires.
