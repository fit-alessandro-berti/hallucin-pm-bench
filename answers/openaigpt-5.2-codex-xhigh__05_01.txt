Add a **48‑hour interrupting boundary timer** to `Task_RequestDocs` (deadline = `Start_Claim` time + 48h). Route the timer’s outgoing flow to an escalation end event (or directly to `Task_Triage`). This cancels the wait for missing documents and auto‑escalates any claim that has not reached `Task_Triage` by 48 hours, satisfying the SLA.
