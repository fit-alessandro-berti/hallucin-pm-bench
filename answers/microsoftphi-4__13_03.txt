1️⃣ The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **once** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst examining only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks in the full month-long log. This snippet represents a small sample of the log, confined to a couple of hours on a single day. It reflects the workflows of just three applications, potentially not representative of broader processes. If normal operations include cases with more automatic checks or cases where manual reviews occur sporadically for specific reasons, this small sample might mislead without broader context. Additionally, the mix of applications and processes (e.g., having both manual and automatic activities) suggests that random selection could skew interpretations of the overall frequency of manual checks without analyzing patterns across the complete data set.
