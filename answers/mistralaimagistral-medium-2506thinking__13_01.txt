# Summary

The answer to the questions are:

1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time** in the fragment.
2. This represents approximately **5.56%** of all logged events.
3. The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is **A1002**.
4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:
   - Temporal limitedness: the data spans less than one day, missing variations in fraud check patterns over longer periods.
   - Small sample size: with only 4 cases and 18 total events, the sample lacks statistical power to generalize monthly trends.

Therefore, the final answers are:

1. 1
2. 5.56%
3. A1002
4. The fragment covers only a fraction of a single day and contains too few cases (only 4) to reliably estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks.

\[
\boxed{1,\ 5.56\%,\ A1002,\ \text{temporal limitedness and small sample size}}
\]
