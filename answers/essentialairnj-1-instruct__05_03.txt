To enforce the SLA without adding new activities, you can attach a timer event definition to the `Activity_CreateAccount` service task, specifying that its event should fire after a duration of 48 hours. This will simulate a deadline for the task and can be used to escalate or notify relevant parties if the task exceeds the SLA.

```xml
<camunda:extensionElements>
  <camunda:timerEventDefinition>
    <camunda:duration>PT48H</camunda:duration>
  </camunda:timerEventDefinition>
</camunda:extensionElements>
```

Justification: 
This timer event definition on the `Activity_CreateAccount` ensures that a timer event is triggered if the task lasts more than 48 hours after completion of the `Activity_VerifyID` task, enforcing the SLA deadline.

You should include this `camunda:extensionElements` node inside the `Activity_CreateAccount` task. Please ensure that `xmlns:camunda="http://bpmn.io/schema/bpmn/biocamunda/1.0" (or a similar Camunda namespace) is included in your XML's root element to bind the `camunda:` extension prefix properly.
