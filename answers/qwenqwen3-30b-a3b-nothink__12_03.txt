1. **No**

2. **Justification:**  
The FACT claims that "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after 'Receive_Order,' with no other activities in between." However, this is not supported by the event log.

- **CaseID C001:**  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` → `Pack_Items`  
  → `Validate_Payment` is *not* immediately after `Receive_Order` (there is a `Pack_Items` activity in between).

- **CaseID C002:**  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment`  
  → `Validate_Payment` is *not* immediately after `Receive_Order` (there is a `Pack_Items` activity in between).

- **CaseID C003:**  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Validate_Payment` → `Ship_Order`  
  → `Validate_Payment` *is* immediately after `Receive_Order` in this case, but not in all cases.

- **CaseID C004:**  
  Sequence: `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment` → `Pack_Items`  
  → `Validate_Payment` is *not* immediately after `Receive_Order` (there is a `Check_Fraud` activity in between).

Thus, the FACT is **not accurate** because there are multiple instances where `Validate_Payment` does not occur immediately after `Receive_Order`.
