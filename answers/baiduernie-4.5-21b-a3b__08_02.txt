**Answer 1.** No, transition **T5** cannot fire before **T3**. For **T5** to fire, its input places **P2** and **P5** must both have tokens. However, **T5** is a synchronizing join requiring both places **P2** and **P5** to be available simultaneously, while **T3** only requires **P2** with token. Since **T5** depends on **T3** producing **P5**, firing **T5** before **T3** creates a logical dependency: **T3** must precede **T5** for both places to be ready.

**Answer 2 (bonus).** Not applicable, as the answer is *no*.
