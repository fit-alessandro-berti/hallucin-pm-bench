Based on the provided event-log excerpt, the FACT is **not accurate**.

**Justification:**  
The FACT claims that "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between. However, this is contradicted by events in Case C002 and Case C004:  

- **Case C002**:  
  - Activity sequence:  
    - Receive_Order at 09:30:00  
    - Pack_Items at 09:50:00 (an activity between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment)  
    - Validate_Payment at 10:05:00  
  Here, Validate_Payment does not occur immediately after Receive_Order; Pack_Items intervenes.  

- **Case C004**:  
  - Activity sequence:  
    - Receive_Order at 10:05:00  
    - Check_Fraud at 10:07:00 (an activity between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment)  
    - Validate_Payment at 10:20:00  
  Again, Validate_Payment is not immediate after Receive_Order due to Check_Fraud.  

In contrast, Cases C001 and C003 show Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order with no intervening activities. However, since the "always" in the FACT fails in C002 and C004, it is inaccurate overall.  

**Relevant CaseIDs and activity sequences cited:**  
- C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment (Pack_Items in between)  
- C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment (Check_Fraud in between)  

Thus, the FACT is false because it does not hold for all cases.  

No.
