**a) Decision Points Summary:**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome**: Assigns a risk rating (Low, Medium, or High) based on three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow).  
2. **Step 4 Conditional Branch**: Skips Manual Underwriting Review if risk is Low/Medium *and* requested amount ≤ €250,000; otherwise proceeds to Step 5.  
3. **TriVote Gate**: Requires at least two of the three designated approvers (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) to approve for the loan to advance.  
4. **Applicant Confirmation Step**: Proceeds to finalization only upon receipt of signed Offer Sheet 77 and ID Matrix Declaration; otherwise stalls or loops back for reconfirmation (implied by requirement).
