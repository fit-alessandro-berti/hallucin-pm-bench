1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs **once** (in case C05).

2.  
   a) 1 / 48 events ≈ **2.08%**  
   b) 1 / 12 cases ≈ **8.33%**

3. A low-support activity (e.g., 2.08% of events, 8.33% of cases) lacks statistical significance. Generalizing from this slice risks overfitting models, distorting cycle-time or resource-allocation metrics, and misrepresenting fraud-check patterns. Analyses may falsely assume manual checks are routine or impactful, when they’re rare exceptions in this data.
