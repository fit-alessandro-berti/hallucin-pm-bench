Add a 48-hour boundary timer on the “Docs complete?” gateway (GW_Docs).  Attach a boundaryEvent (e.g. Timer_48h) to GW_Docs with a timerDefinition of PT48H, and connect its outgoing sequenceFlow to Task_Triage.  If docs aren’t completed within 48 hours, the timer fires and routes the claim straight to Triage Claim (Task_Triage), ensuring SLA compliance.
