Yes.

Concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:
- T1 fires: p0 → p1 + p2
  Marking: p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, others=0
- T2 fires: p1 → p3
  Marking: p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0
- T5 fires: p3 –|p4 → p6 (enabled since p4=0)
  Marking after T5: p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=1

Explanation:
- After T1 and T2, we have p3=1 and p4=0, so the inhibitor condition of T5 (p4=0) is satisfied. Thus T5 can fire before T3, demonstrating that T5 firing before T3 is possible.
