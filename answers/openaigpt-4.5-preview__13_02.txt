3. Low-support activities, like Manual_Fraud_Check, appear rarely in a small dataset. Their scarce representation can distort conclusions in performance metrics or predictive models. Analysts might either undervalue their significance by overlooking them or overestimate their importance if they mistakenly perceive them as common. Hence, generalizing from such a small excerpt can lead to inaccurate measures of activity duration, frequency, and overall process complexity, skewing resource allocation or predictive accuracy.
