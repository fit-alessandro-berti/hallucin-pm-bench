Yes, it is possible for **T5** to fire before **T3**.

### One shortest firing sequence

A shortest firing sequence in which **T5** fires and **T3** has not fired yet is:

> **T1, T2b, T4, T5**

Marking evolution:

1. **Initial**:  
   - p0 = 1

2. After **T1** (p0 → pa, pb):  
   - pa = 1, pb = 1

3. After **T2b** (pa → pd):  
   - pd = 1, pb = 1

4. After **T4** (pb → pe):  
   - pd = 1, pe = 1

5. After **T5** (pd, pe → pf):  
   - pf = 1

Up to and including the firing of **T5**, transition **T3** has not fired.

### Why this is shortest

To enable **T5**, we need:
- a token in **pd**, and
- a token in **pe**.

From the net:

- **pe** comes only from **T4**, which requires **pb**.
- **pb** comes only from **T1**.
- **pd** must come from either **T2b** (from **pa**) or **T3** (from **pc**).

To have **T5** fire *before* **T3**, we cannot use **T3** to produce **pd**, so **pd** must come from **T2b**, which in turn requires **pa** from **T1**.

Thus, before the first occurrence of **T5**, we must fire at least:
- **T1** (to create pa and pb),
- **T2b** (to turn pa into pd without using T3),
- **T4** (to turn pb into pe).

That is three transitions before **T5**, so any such sequence has length at least 4. The sequence

> **T1, T2b, T4, T5**

achieves this bound, so it is indeed shortest.
