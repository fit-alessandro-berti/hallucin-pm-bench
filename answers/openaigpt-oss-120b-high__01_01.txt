**Decision points in Contoso Airlines’ flight‑refund process**

| # | Decision point (activity) | What is decided | Basis for the decision |
|---|----------------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility** | *Eligibility of the refund claim* – the claim is either **eligible** (may proceed) or **ineligible** (stops). | Comparison of the submitted claim with the **FlightManifest** and the **WeatherReport**. |
| 2 | **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** | *Pre‑approval* – the finance controller either **pre‑approves** the claim or **rejects** it. | Review of the claim against the **EligibilityChecklist**. |
| 3 | **Senior_Auditor_Review** (high‑value branch only) | *Final audit approval* – the senior auditor either **approves** the high‑value claim or **rejects** it. | Required **only** when the refund amount > €1 000 and the review must include the **AuditTrail**. |

*Note*: The constraint that **Process_Refund_Payment** may start only after the pre‑approval (and the senior‑auditor review for high‑value claims) is a procedural rule, not a separate decision point.
