1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” appears exactly 1 time.  
2. That is 1 out of 18 total events, i.e., (1/18)*100 = 5.56%.  
3. It occurs in case: A1002.  
4. Two sampling‐related reasons why such a monthly estimate is unreliable:  
   • The data fragment covers only a single day’s (or partial day’s) events, so it is not representative of the entire month.  
   • The sample is small and was not randomly collected, thus it may bias the frequency estimate of manual fraud checks.
