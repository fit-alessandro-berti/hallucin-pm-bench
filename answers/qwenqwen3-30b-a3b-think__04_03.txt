No.  
**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1:** Satisfied (QE occurs before RA, both once).  
- **Rule 2:** Satisfied (VP occurs after QE and RA).  
- **Rule 3:** Violated (Notify_Authorities occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review completes).  
- **Rule 4:** Partially satisfied (Close_Case occurs after NA and VP), but Rule 3 violation invalidates compliance.  

The trace fails due to Rule 3.
