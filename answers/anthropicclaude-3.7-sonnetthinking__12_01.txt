# Fact Check: False

The claim that "Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory" is false based on the event-log fragment.

Evidence:
- In Case 1001, "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02), not after it
- In Case 1002, "Update_Inventory" does not appear at all
- In Case 1003, "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18), with "Quality_Check" in between

In fact, in all cases where both activities appear, "Update_Inventory" actually precedes "Authorize_Refund" rather than following it, which is the opposite of what the claim states.
