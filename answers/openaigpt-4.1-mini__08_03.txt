Let's analyze the Petri net step by step, starting from the initial marking and understanding the dependencies, focusing on whether **T5** can fire *before* **T3**.

### Net recap and goal

- **Places:** p0, pa, pb, pc, pd, pe, pf
- **Transitions:**

| Transition | Input places | Output places | Notes                |
|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| T1         | p0           | pa, pb        | parallel split       |
| T2         | pa           | pc            | normal path          |
| T2b        | pa           | pd            | shortcut, skips pc   |
| T3         | pc           | pd            | continuation normal  |
| T4         | pb           | pe            |                      |
| T5         | pd, pe       | pf            | synchronizing join   |
| T6         | pf           | pc            | feedback loop        |

**Initial Marking:** p0 = 1 (all others 0)

### Question:

> Can **T5** fire before **T3**?

I.e., is there a reachable marking where T5 is enabled and fires, and so far T3 has not fired?

---

### Intuition

- T5 requires tokens in both **pd** and **pe**.
- **pe** is produced only by T4, which requires a token in pb.
- pb comes from T1, from p0.
- pd can be produced via two ways:
  - via normal path: pa -> (T2) pc -> (T3) pd
  - via shortcut: pa -> (T2b) pd

So to get pd token, we can use either:

- T2 + T3 sequence, or
- T2b shortcut (which skips T3).

If we can get pd without firing T3, then T5 might be enabled before T3 fires.

---

### Step-by-step

Start from marking:

- M0: p0 = 1

**Fire T1:**

- Input: p0=1
- Output: pa=1, pb=1
- M1: pa=1, pb=1

From here, the tokens are:

- pa=1
- pb=1

Now:

- T2 enabled (input pa), produces pc
- T2b enabled (input pa), produces pd
- T4 enabled (input pb), produces pe

---

Goal: reach enabling of T5 (pd and pe both â‰¥ 1) before any T3 fires.

Since T3 requires pc, which is produced by T2, let's consider toggling T2b first to produce pd directly without going through T3.

---

**Fire T2b:**

- consumes pa=1, produces pd=1
- M2: pb=1, pd=1

Note: pa token consumed, so T2 and T3 won't be enabled anymore.

**Fire T4:**

- consumes pb=1, produces pe=1
- M3: pd=1, pe=1

Now, T5 is enabled (inputs pd=1, pe=1).

---

**Fire T5:**

- consumes pd=1, pe=1, produces pf=1
- M4: pf=1

Up to now, transitions fired: T1, T2b, T4, T5

Has T3 fired? No.

---

### Conclusion:

- Yes, T5 **can** fire before T3.
- One **shortest** firing sequence (transitions in order) is:

```
T1; T2b; T4; T5
```

---

### Summary explanation:

- The shortcut path T2b produces pd directly from pa, without passing through pc.
- Since T3 requires pc to produce pd, if we take the shortcut T2b, T3 is never enabled.
- Hence, T5 can synchronize pd (from T2b) and pe (from T4) and fire before T3 fires.

---

# **Final answer:**

**Yes**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Shortest firing sequence demonstrating this:**

```
T1; T2b; T4; T5
```

This sequence reaches a marking where:

- T3 has never fired,
- but T5 can fire because it receives tokens from pd (via T2b) and pe (via T4).
