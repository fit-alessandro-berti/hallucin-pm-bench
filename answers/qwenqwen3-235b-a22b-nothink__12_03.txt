**Answer: No**

**Justification:**

The FACT claims that **“Validate_Payment” always occurs immediately after “Receive_Order,” with no other activities in between.** However, the event-log excerpt provides **counterexamples** that violate this rule.

1. **CaseID C002:**
   - Sequence:  
     - `C002,Receive_Order,2025-01-03T09:30:00`  
     - `C002,Pack_Items,2025-01-03T09:50:00`  
     - `C002,Validate_Payment,2025-01-03T10:05:00`  
   - **Issue:** `Pack_Items` occurs **between** `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, contradicting the claim that `Validate_Payment` always immediately follows `Receive_Order`.

2. **CaseID C004:**
   - Sequence:  
     - `C004,Receive_Order,2025-01-03T10:05:00`  
     - `C004,Check_Fraud,2025-01-03T10:07:00`  
     - `C004,Validate_Payment,2025-01-03T10:20:00`  
     - `C004,Pack_Items,2025-01-03T10:45:00`  
   - **Issue:** `Check_Fraud` occurs **between** `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`, again refuting the FACT.

✅ Therefore, the FACT is **not accurate** based on the evidence in the event log.
