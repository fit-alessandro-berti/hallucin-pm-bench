1. **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
1 time

2. **What percentage of all logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**

4. **Give two sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable.**  
- The fragment covers only a single day (May 1, 2025), so it is not representative of typical monthly variation or seasonality.  
- The sample size is very small (only 4 cases, with one containing the activity), leading to high variance and low confidence in extrapolation to a full month.
