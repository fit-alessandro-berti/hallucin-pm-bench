### Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

The Micro-loan Fast-Track process includes the following key decision points where outcomes determine the next steps or final approval/rejection. These are summarized below using the exact activity names:

- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: Compares risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B. If scores differ by ≤ 2 points, proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC). If scores differ by > 2 points, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision before continuing.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: Evaluates the loan amount. If amount < €15 000, the system auto-approves and proceeds to Disburse Funds. If amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: The Micro-loan Board votes to approve or reject the application (only for amounts ≥ €15 000). If approved, proceed to Disburse Funds; if rejected, the process ends without disbursement.

(Note: Other steps like Quick KYC Verification (KYC), Community Impact Assessment (CIA), and Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC) involve assessments or checks but are not explicit decision gates that branch the flow.)
