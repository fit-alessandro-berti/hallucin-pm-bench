**No**

### Justification:

- **Rule 1 violated**: QE and RA must occur **once each and in that order**.  
  → Trace has: `QE` → `NA` → `RA` → ❌ RA occurs **after** NA, violating the required **QE then RA** sequence.

- **Rule 3 violated**: NA must **not occur until after both QE and RA** are complete.  
  → NA occurs **immediately after QE**, but **before RA** → clear violation.

- **Rule 2**: VP must occur after both QE and RA — this is satisfied (VP comes after RA), but irrelevant due to prior violations.

- **Rule 4**: CC occurs after NA (and VP) — technically satisfied here, but irrelevant since earlier rules are violated.

### Conclusion:  
The trace violates **Rule 1** and **Rule 3**. The mandatory order of QE → RA must be respected before any NA. The current sequence (QE → NA → RA) makes the trace **non-compliant**.
