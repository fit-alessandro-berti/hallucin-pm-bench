The stated fact is inaccurate because there are instances where Validate_Payment does not follow Receive_Order. In case C003, the Validate_Payment activity occurs on line 6, which is before the Receive_Order activity on line 7. Furthermore, in case C005, the Validate_Payment activity on line 11 is the first event for that case and is not preceded by a Receive_Order event.
