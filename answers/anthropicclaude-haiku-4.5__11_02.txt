## Three Worst-Performing Activities

**1. Request_Documents**
- **Problem:** Extreme wait time (150 min) and highest rework rate (22%). Throughput drops to 190/day.
- **Root cause:** Queue congestion and frequent resubmissions suggest unclear document requirements or inadequate initial guidance.
- **Action:** Implement automated document checklist at claim registration; escalate to Initial Assessment only when complete. Target: reduce rework to <5%.

**2. Review_Documents**
- **Problem:** Longest processing time (25 min), highest SLA breach (12.4%), high variability (stdev 9 min).
- **Root cause:** Inconsistent review criteria and/or complex case complexity requiring specialist judgment.
- **Action:** Standardize review criteria via decision matrix; implement tiered review (simple vs. complex pathway). Target: reduce processing time to 15 min.

**3. Initial_Assessment**
- **Problem:** High wait time (18 min) and elevated SLA breach (3.2%); rework rate 1.8%.
- **Root cause:** Queue buildup upstream; assessment criteria may lack clarity.
- **Action:** Cross-train staff for surge capacity; add quality checkpoints to prevent downstream rework. Target: reduce wait time to <8 min.

**Estimated impact:** ~15% end-to-end cycle time reduction.
