#### 4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable:

**1. Selection bias:**  
The fragment represents only a single day of activity, not a random or representative sample of a month. Events from one day may not reflect typical or daily volumes, especially if certain activities are more likely to occur on specific days (e.g., fraud checks might be less common on other days).

**2. Small sample size:**  
With only 18 events observed, the estimate of frequency is highly variable and subject to random fluctuations. A small sample size increases the margin of error and makes it difficult to infer the true monthly rate with confidence.
