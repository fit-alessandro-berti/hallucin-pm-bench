To meet the SLA without adding new tasks, I recommend attaching a **Boundary Timer Event** (non-interrupting) to the **Task_Check** (or **Task_Receive**) with a duration of `PT48H`. 

Currently, flow **f6** allows incomplete claims to proceed to **Task_Triage**, but a delay in document submission could breach the SLA. By adding an **Escalation Boundary Event** or a **Timer Event** on the early path and connecting it via a new Sequence Flow directly to **Task_Triage**, you ensure the claim moves forward automatically. 

Specifically: Attach a Timer Event to **Task_Check** and connect it to **Task_Triage**. This bypasses manual delays, forcing the claim into the Triage phase within 48 hours regardless of the status of **f4** or **f6**.
