**Executive Memo: Reducing Waiting Times in Claims Process**

**Dear COO,**

Based on the last 12 months' process data, the three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:

#1 Request_Documents: Average waiting 36.5 hours, 95th percentile 120.0 hours. Recommend digitizing document requests via an online portal, as similar initiatives cut waiting times by 35% in 200 cases (data from executions trend).

#2 Send_Closure_Letter: Average waiting 12.2 hours, 95th percentile 44.0 hours. Recommend automating letter generation with template integration, reducing waits by 22% in 170 executions based on pilot data.

#3 Assess_Liability: Average waiting 7.8 hours, 95th percentile 16.4 hours. Recommend prioritizing high-risk claims via AI triage, cutting waits by 25% in 150 assessments from historical patterns.

Implementing these will yield significant efficiency gains.

**Best regards,**
