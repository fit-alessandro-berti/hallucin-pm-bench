**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – confirmation of ID card and mobile phone; *no credit history checks*.  
2. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – determines whether the two underwriters’ risk scores differ by ≤ 2 points; if not, escalation to the Harmonisation Committee.  
3. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** – requires at least 3 local references to be collected.  
4. **Amount Threshold Decision** – determines whether the loan amount is < €15 000 (auto-approval) or ≥ €15 000 (proceeds to MBA).  
5. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – board votes *approve* or *reject* for loans ≥ €15 000.
