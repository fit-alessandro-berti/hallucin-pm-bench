1 ) The average cycle time (in hours) of the activity **“Review Contract”** across all cases in the log above **cannot be derived** from the provided data.  

2 ) **Explanation**: The event log only includes the sequence of activities per case (e.g., "Receive Renewal Request," "Review Contract") and the resources involved, but it lacks **timestamps** or **duration metrics** for individual activities. Without this data, it is impossible to calculate the time taken for "Review Contract" or any other activity. The historical benchmark (FY-2023) is from a different customer segment and explicitly excluded from use for this analysis.
