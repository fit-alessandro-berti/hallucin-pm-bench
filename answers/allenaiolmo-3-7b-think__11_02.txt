**Key Findings and Recommendations:**  

1. **Request Documents (avg_wait_time_min=150 min, rework_rate_pct=22.0%, sla_breach_pct=5.5%)**  
   The 150-minute average wait time creates severe delays, while high rework rates suggest incomplete initial submissions. Recommend increasing staff allocation during peak hours and automating validation steps to reduce errors and accelerate processing.  

2. **Review Documents (sla_breach_pct=12.4%)**  
   Over 12% of cases exceed the SLA due to prolonged processing times (avg. 25 min). Streamline the review workflow by automating document checks to reduce execution time and meet targets.  

3. **Initial Assessment (avg_wait_time_min=18 min)**  
   Despite moderate rework (1.8%), the 18-minute wait time lags behind other activities, causing downstream bottlenecks. Optimize assessment procedures or reallocate resources to this stage to shorten queue times.  

**Conclusion:** These three activities drive the majority of performance issues. Addressing their bottlenecks will improve throughput, reduce customer wait times, and enhance SLA compliance. Immediate action on these areas is critical for Q2 performance.
