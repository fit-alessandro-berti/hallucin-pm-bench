**a) Summary of Decision Points in Acme’s Small-Business Loan-Approval Process**

1. **Risk Assessment (Tri-Color-Risk-Check):**  
   _Decision:_ Classify the loan application as Low, Medium, or High risk based on Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow inputs.

2. **Conditional Step (Skip Manual Underwriting):**  
   _Rule:_ If the risk is Low or Medium *and* the requested amount is less than or equal to €250,000, then skip the Manual-Underwriting-Review step; otherwise, proceed to it.

3. **Decision-Gate “TriVote”:**  
   _Rule:_ Approvals from any two out of the three roles—Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer—are sufficient to pass this gate.
