Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment are currently Orion’s weakest process links.  Each breaches its target SLA and is held up by the longest queues in the workflow, directly threatening customer-experience goals.

• Legal Approval averages 900 s against a 600 s SLA—an overrun of 300 s—and its 600 s average waiting time is the highest in the chain.  
• Risk Review averages 600 s versus a 300 s SLA, also overrunning by 300 s, while clients wait 480 s before work even starts.  
• Credit Assessment averages 300 s against a 240 s SLA, exceeding the target by 60 s and holding applicants in queue for 200 s.

Recommended actions  
• Legal Approval: Re-allocate even 10 % of the 465 monthly cases to an additional legal reviewer; cutting the 600 s queue in half would bring total time within the 600 s SLA.  
• Risk Review: Introduce a pre-screen to route the lowest-risk 20 % of the 480 cases directly to Draft Offer, trimming the current 480 s wait proportionally.  
• Credit Assessment: Add one scoring workstation during peak periods; reducing the 200 s wait by one-third yields a projected throughput of ≤240 s, eliminating the 60 s overrun.
