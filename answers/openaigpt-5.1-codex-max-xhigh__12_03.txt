1. No.

2. The claim is violated. In case C002 the sequence is Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment, so Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment. In case C004 the sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment, with Check_Fraud in between. Only C001 and C003 have Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order, so it does not always happen.
