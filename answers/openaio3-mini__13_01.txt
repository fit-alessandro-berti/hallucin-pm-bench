1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs exactly 1 time.

2. There are a total of 18 log lines. Therefore, the activity accounts for (1/18) × 100 = 5.56% of all logged events.

3. Only case A1002 contains “Manual_Fraud_Check.”

4. Two sampling-related reasons why a data scientist’s monthly frequency estimate based on this fragment is unreliable are:
   • The fragment covers only a very short time window (a single day) and may not capture variability or seasonal patterns over a full month.
   • The sample size is very limited and may be subject to random fluctuations or bias, making it unrepresentative of typical monthly behavior.
