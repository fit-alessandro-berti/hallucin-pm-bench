**Question 1.** No.

**Question 2.** T5 requires both P2 and P5 to have tokens. P5 receives a token only after T4 fires, and T4 requires P4 to have a token. P4 receives its first token only after T3 fires (•P4 = {T3,T7}, but T7 requires T2 → P3 → T7, which is after T1 → P2 → T3 path). Thus, T3 must fire before P4 is marked, before T4, before P5, before T5. No sequence allows T5 before T3.
