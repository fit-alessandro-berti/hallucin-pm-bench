Introduce a timer event on the "Task_Check" node with a 48-hour duration. If the timer expires before the task is completed, automatically route the flow to "Task_RequestDocs" via the "GW_Docs" gateway. This ensures claims are triaged within SLA without adding new tasks. Modify "Task_Check" to include a timer event definition.
