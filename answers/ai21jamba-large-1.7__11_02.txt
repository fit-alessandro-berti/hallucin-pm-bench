### Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance

**Overview**
Three activities significantly underperform in Q1-2025, based on key metrics including processing time, rework rate, and SLA breaches: **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.

1. **Request_Documents**
	- **Issue**: This activity has the highest rework rate (22%) and the longest wait time (150 minutes).
	- **Action**: Conduct a root cause analysis to identify and address inefficiencies in the document request process. Consider streamlining communication or automating document submissions to reduce errors and delays.
2. **Review_Documents**
	- **Issue**: It has the longest average processing time (25 minutes), the second-highest variability (9 minutes), and a notable SLA breach rate (12.4%).
	- **Action**: Implement targeted training for staff to improve consistency and efficiency in document reviews. Introduce a quality control mechanism to flag cases at risk of SLA breaches.
3. **Initial_Assessment**
	- **Issue**: It has the highest SLA breach rate (3.2%) and the second-longest average wait time (18 minutes).
	- **Action**: Reduce bottlenecks in the initial assessment workflow by redistributing workloads or optimizing staff allocation. Regularly monitor SLA compliance to identify emerging issues promptly.

Focusing on these actions will enhance efficiency and reduce delays in the claims handling process.
