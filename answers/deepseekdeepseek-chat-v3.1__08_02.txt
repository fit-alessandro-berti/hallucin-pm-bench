**Question 1.** Yes.

**Question 2.** Here is a minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.
The sequence is valid because:
1.  T1 fires, placing tokens in P1 and P2.
2.  T2 and then T7 fire on the left branch, moving the token from P1 to P3 to P4.
3.  T4 fires, moving the token from P4 to P5.
4.  A token is now in P5 *and* the token in P2 (from step 1) is still present.
5.  This enables and fires the synchronising join **T5 before T3** has been fired on the right branch.
