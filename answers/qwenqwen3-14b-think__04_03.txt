No. The trace violates Rule 3 because `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs at step 4, **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) is completed at step 5. Rule 3 explicitly requires NA to occur **only after** both QE and RA are complete. While Rule 1 is satisfied (QE precedes RA), and Rules 2 and 4 are met (VP occurs after RA, and CC occurs after NA and VP), the premature NA violates Rule 3.
