Okay, so I need to find all the pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel. Let me start by carefully going through the description of Process B to identify which steps can run at the same time.

First, Process B starts with Create_Work_Order. That's step 1. Then step 2 says Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run simultaneously. So right from the beginning, Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines can happen at the same time. That's the first pair: Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines.

Moving on, step 3 mentions Fabricate begins only after both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines are complete. So Fabricate has to wait for both previous tasks, but there's no parallelism here yet.

Next, step 4 says Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel right after Fabricate. So once Fabricate is done, both these tasks start at the same time. That's another pair: Quality_Check and Create_Documentation.

Then step 5 states Package starts when both Quality_Check and Create_Documentation are finished. So Package waits for both to complete, but again, no new parallel tasks here.

Step 6 is Dispatch_to_Customer, which follows Package. And step 7 is Close_Work_Order, completing the process. Neither of these involve parallel tasks.

So the pairs that can be executed in parallel are:

1. Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines (from step 2)
2. Quality_Check and Create_Documentation (from step 4)

Now, I need to list them in alphabetical order, both within each pair and overall. Let's check:

The pairs are:
- Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
- Quality_Check  —  Create_Documentation

Both pairs are already in alphabetical order within themselves. Comparing the first tasks of each pair: Procure_Materials vs Quality_Check. Alphabetically, P comes before Q, so the first pair comes first. Then the second pair. So the final list should be:

Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
Quality_Check  —  Create_Documentation
Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
Quality_Check  —  Create_Documentation
