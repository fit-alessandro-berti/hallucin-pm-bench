**SUBJECT:** Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks & Remediation

Process mining reveals three critical waiting-time bottlenecks requiring immediate intervention:

1. **Request_Documents** (Avg: 36.5h, 95p: 120.0h)
   *Action:* Deploy automated portal requests to eliminate manual follow-up delays.
2. **Send_Closure_Letter** (Avg: 12.2h, 95p: 44.0h)
   *Action:* Transition to digital notifications to bypass physical mail queues.
3. **Assess_Liability** (Avg: 7.8h, 95p: 16.4h)
