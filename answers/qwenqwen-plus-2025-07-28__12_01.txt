No, the fact is not accurate.

Justification: In case 1001, "Authorize_Refund" occurs at 2025-03-01 08:30:02, which is *after* "Update_Inventory" at 2025-03-01 08:25:55. Similarly, in case 1003, "Update_Inventory" occurs at 10:08:07, while "Authorize_Refund" occurs later at 10:22:18. In both cases, "Authorize_Refund" does not occur immediately before "Update_Inventory"; instead, it occurs after. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by cases 1001 and 1003.
