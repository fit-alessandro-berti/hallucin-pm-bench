**Answer:**  
Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3.  

**Shortest firing sequence:**  
`[T1, T2b, T4, T5]`  

**Explanation:**  
1. **T1 fires**: Consumes the token in `p0`, producing tokens in `pa` and `pb`.  
2. **T2b fires**: Consumes the token in `pa`, producing a token in `pd`.  
3. **T4 fires**: Consumes the token in `pb`, producing a token in `pe`.  
4. **T5 fires**: Now enabled (tokens in `pd` and `pe`), it consumes them and produces a token in `pf`.  

T3 is never activated in this sequence, as the "normal path" (T2 followed by T3) is bypassed via T2b.
