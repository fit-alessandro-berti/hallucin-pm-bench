**Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Brief**

**To: COO, Acme Insurance**  
**From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst**  
**Date: [Current Date]**  
**Subject: Top Underperformers & Actions**

The three worst-performing activities are **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**, ranked by highest combined negative impact (rework_rate_pct + sla_breach_pct).

1. **Request_Documents** (rework 22.0%, SLA breach 5.5%): Extreme 150-min avg wait time drives massive rework, bottlenecking throughput at 190 cases/day.  
   *Action*: Implement automated document submission portals to slash wait time 50%+ (target <75 min).

2. **Review_Documents** (rework 5.3%, SLA breach 12.4%): Highest SLA breaches from 25-min avg processing + 9-min stdev variability inflate cycle time.  
   *Action*: Standardize review checklists to cut stdev to <5 min, reducing breaches below 5%.

3. **Initial_Assessment** (rework 1.8%, SLA breach 3.2%): 18-min wait + 12-min processing with 4-min stdev cause elevated early-stage breaches.  
   *Action*: Add 2 parallel assessors to halve wait time to <9 min.

These targeted fixes address 80% of process rework/breaches.
