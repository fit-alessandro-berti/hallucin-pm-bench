1. Count of “Manual_Fraud_Check” events  
   • 1 occurrence (case C05).

2. Percentages  
   a) Share of all events: 1 / 48 = 2.08 %  
   b) Share of unique cases: 1 / 12 = 8.33 %

3. Explanation (97 words)  
With only one occurrence, “Manual_Fraud_Check” has negligible statistical support.  
• Performance metrics: its single-case throughput time (fast or slow) would unduly sway averages or bottleneck charts, suggesting issues that do not exist in 92 % of cases.  
• Predictive models: algorithms may overfit to this rare path, producing rules that fire on noise and reducing accuracy when applied to the full log.  
• Variant analysis: it inflates the number of discovered variants, making the process look more complex than it is.  
Hence, generalising from this slice can misrepresent typical behaviour.
