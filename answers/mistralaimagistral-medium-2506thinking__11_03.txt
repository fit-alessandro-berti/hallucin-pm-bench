**Executive Memo:**

Based on available data, the three worst-performing activities in terms of SLA breaches and high waiting time are as follows:

- **Legal Approval**: Exceeds SLA by 300s with 600s waiting time.
- **Risk Review**: Exceeds SLA by 300s with 480s waiting time.
- **Credit Assessment**: Exceeds SLA by 60s with 200s waiting time.

Recommendations for improvement:
- **Legal Approval**: Reduce waiting time by increasing capacity or streamlining approval steps.
- **Risk Review**: Parallelize reviews and improve preparatory steps to reduce bottlenecks.
- **Credit Assessment**: Optimize queue management to reduce the 200s waiting time.

These actions aim to address the high waiting times and significant SLA breaches in these critical activities.
