**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance**

The process exhibits specific constraints primarily in two stages:

1.  **Request_Documents:** Suffers from extreme wait times (150 min) and a 22% rework rate.
    *   *Action:* Implement batch intake to reduce queue times and rework.
2.  **Review_Documents:** Bottlenecks due to lengthy processing (25 min) and a 12.4% SLA breach.
    *   *Action:* Introduce automated triage to separate standard claims from complex ones.
3.  **Ambiguity:** The final activities (Pay_Claim, Notify_Customer, Approve_Claim) show clustered low throughput (179–182), making a third distinct worst performer indistinguishable without additional data segmentation.
