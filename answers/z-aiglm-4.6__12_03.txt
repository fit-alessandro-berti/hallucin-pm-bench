The FACT is inaccurate. While this sequence occurs in some cases, it does not occur in all cases, which is required by the word "always."

**Justification:**

*   **Case C002:** The activity sequence is `Receive_Order` -> `Pack_Items` -> `Validate_Payment`. The activity `Pack_Items` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.
*   **Case C004:** The activity sequence is `Receive_Order` -> `Check_Fraud` -> `Validate_Payment`. The activity `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.
