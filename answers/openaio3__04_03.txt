No.

Rule-1: satisfied – QE appears once and before RA.  
Rule-2: satisfied – with severity High, VP occurs after both QE and RA.  
Rule-3: violated – NA is executed after QE but **before** RA, whereas it must wait until both QE and RA are complete.  
Rule-4: satisfied – CC occurs after NA and VP.

Because Rule-3 is violated, the trace is not compliant.
