 To improve SLA compliance in the given Employee-Onboarding process, I propose adjusting the due dates of the tasks to ensure that they are completed within the required timeframe. In this case, I suggest reducing the due date for the "Prepare Contract" task from P2D (2 days) to P1D (1 day) to align with the other tasks that have a 1-day due date.

Here's the unified diff of the XML:

```diff
- <bpmn:userTask id="Task_PrepareContract"  name="Prepare Contract"       camunda:dueDate="P2D"/>
+ <bpmn:userTask id="Task_PrepareContract"  name="Prepare Contract"       camunda:dueDate="P1D"/>
```

Rationale: By reducing the due date for the "Prepare Contract" task, we ensure that it is completed within the same timeframe as other tasks in the process, which should help in meeting the overall SLA requirements.
