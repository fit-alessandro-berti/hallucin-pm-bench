I cannot compute any of the requested metrics from the provided information because the actual event data (all rows and timestamps) have been fully redacted. To calculate the average cycle time of “Approve Invoice” in hours, its standard deviation, and a 95% confidence interval, I would need the underlying start_time and complete_time values (or at least complete_time and a well-defined start reference) for each occurrence of that activity across all cases. With only column headers and no records, there is no numerical basis to derive durations, variation, or sampling error; any attempt to do so would be a guess and therefore invalid for an audit.
