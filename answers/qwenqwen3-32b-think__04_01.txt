Non-compliant  
1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity 4), requiring `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods` (activity 8). However, `Risk_Assessment` (activity 9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods`, violating the rule.  
2. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (activity 6), `Three_way_match` (activity 10) is executed three activities later (distance = 4), exceeding the allowed maximum distance of 2.  
3. **Rule 1 and 5 compliance**: The PO amount (€12,300) required dual approvals (Procurement Officer and CFO) before `Issue_PO`, which were correctly applied. The trace ends with `Archive_Record`, satisfying Rule 5.  
4. **Rule 4 compliance**: No activity by an **Intern** directly follows an activity by the **CFO** (CFO’s activity is followed by `Expedite_Flag` by System).  

The violations in Rules 2 and 3 make the trace non-compliant.
