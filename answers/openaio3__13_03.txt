1️⃣ The activity string “Manual Fraud Check” appears 1 time in the excerpt.

2️⃣ The excerpt spans only 14 events from three cases recorded within about two morning hours on March 1. Such a narrow, time-bound sample may not reflect the distribution of activities across thousands of cases and 31 days. Manual fraud checks could be clustered at other times, triggered by specific loan types, risk scores, regions, or staff shifts not visible here. Conversely, automation might dominate later in the month. Because the analyst lacks information on total case volume, process changes, or temporal patterns, extrapolating this single occurrence to the whole month risks under- or overestimating the true frequency of manual fraud checks.
