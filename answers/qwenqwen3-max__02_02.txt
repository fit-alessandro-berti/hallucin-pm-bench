**Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

We examine the `case` attribute in each line:
- C001 (lines 1, 3, 7)
- C002 (lines 2, 5, 8, 10)
- C003 (lines 4, 6, 9)

Thus, there are **3 distinct cases**: C001, C002, and C003.

**Answer: 3**

**Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred**

From the log, events for case C002 are:
- Line 2: `Receive_Order` at 09:15:10  
- Line 5: `Check_Stock` at 09:22:55  
- Line 8: `Arrange_Delivery` at 10:15:20  
- Line 10: `Ship_Order` at 10:25:40  

Ordered by timestamp, the sequence is:

**Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

---

**Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered)**

We need to find, for each occurrence of `Ship_Order`, the activity that comes **immediately before it in the same case**.

- **C001**:  
  Events: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
  → Activity before Ship_Order: **Check_Stock**

- **C002**:  
  Events: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
  → Activity before Ship_Order: **Arrange_Delivery**

- **C003**:  
  Events: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
  → Activity before Ship_Order: **Check_Stock**

So the set of activities that immediately precede “Ship_Order” is:
- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock

Sorted alphabetically:
- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock

**Answer:**
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
