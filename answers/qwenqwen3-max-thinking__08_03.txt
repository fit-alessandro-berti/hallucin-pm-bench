**Answer: Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

### Shortest firing sequence in which **T5 fires before T3**:

**⟨ T1, T2b, T4, T5 ⟩**

### Step‑by‑step verification:

Start from the **initial marking**:  

- **M₀**: p0=1, all others = 0.

1. **T1** fires  
   - consumes 1 token from **p0**  
   - produces 1 token in **pa**, 1 token in **pb**  
   - **M₁**: pa=1, pb=1

2. **T2b** fires (instead of T2)  
   - consumes 1 token from **pa**  
   - produces 1 token in **pd**  
   - **M₂**: pb=1, pd=1

3. **T4** fires  
   - consumes 1 token from **pb**  
   - produces 1 token in **pe**  
   - **M₃**: pd=1, pe=1

4. **T5** fires  
   - consumes 1 token from **pd** and 1 from **pe**  
   - produces 1 token in **pf**  
   - **M₄**: pf=1

At this point **T5 has fired**, and **T3 has never fired** (it requires a token in **pc**, which has never been produced because we took the shortcut **T2b** instead of **T2 → T3**).

Therefore, **T5 can fire before T3**, and the above four‑transition sequence is the **shortest possible** (T5 needs tokens in both pd and pe; the quickest way to obtain those without ever producing pc is exactly the path shown).

Thus, the answer is **yes**, with the shortest firing sequence **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**.
