Okay, here's the breakdown of Acme Bank's small-business loan approval process, focusing on decision points and required documents, as you've described:

**a) Decision Points (Gates/Conditional Branches)**

1.  **Assign-Deck-Reviewer:**  The process begins by assigning a Deck Officer to review the application. 
2.  **Tri-Color-Risk-Check:** This step determines the loan risk level based on three different scorecards.
3.  **Conditional Skip (Risk & Amount):** If the risk rating is Low or Medium *and* the requested amount is less than or equal to â‚¬250,000, the Manual Underwriting Review is skipped.
4.  **Decision-Gate "TriVote":**  The loan's approval requires approvals from at least two out of the three designated parties: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer.

**b) List of Required Documents (in order of first appearance)**

1.  **Form 14B** (Receive-Application)
2.  **Deck Memo** (Manual-Underwriting-Review)
3.  **Offer Sheet 77** (Prepare-Binding-Offer)
4.  **ID Matrix Declaration** (Request-Applicant-Confirmation)
5.  **Loan Dossier 2025** (Finalize-Agreement)
