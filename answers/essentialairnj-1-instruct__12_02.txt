No. The fact is not accurate. The activity *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* because line 6 shows *Validate_Payment* coming **before** *Receive_Order* for customer **C003**. Academically: 
* Precedence analysis reveals C003's case has a sequence (10:43Z) Validate_Payment -> (10:45Z) Receive_Order, contradicting the claimed sequence.
