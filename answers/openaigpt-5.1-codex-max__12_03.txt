1. No.

2. In case **C002**, after “Receive_Order” at 09:30, “Pack_Items” occurs at 09:50 before “Validate_Payment” at 10:05, so “Validate_Payment” is not immediately after. Similarly, in case **C004**, “Check_Fraud” at 10:07 intervenes between “Receive_Order” at 10:05 and “Validate_Payment” at 10:20.
