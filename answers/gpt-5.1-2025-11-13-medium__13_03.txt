1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst viewing only this snippet could misestimate the prevalence of manual fraud checks because it contains just **three cases** over a short time window. In this small sample, there is **one** explicit “Manual Fraud Check” and multiple automated variants (“Automatic Fraud Check”, “Fraud Check (Automatic)”), plus “Manual Review,” which may or may not be a fraud-related step. With no visibility into the remaining cases and days of the month, the observed ratio of manual to automatic checks in this fragment cannot be assumed to represent the full March 2025 event log.
