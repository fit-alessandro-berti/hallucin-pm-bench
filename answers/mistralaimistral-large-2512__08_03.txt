Let's analyze the Petri net to determine if T5 can fire before T3 in any reachable marking.

### Key Observations:
1. **T5's Inputs**: T5 requires tokens in both `pd` and `pe` to fire.
2. **T3's Role**: T3 moves a token from `pc` to `pd` (part of the "normal" path).
3. **Initial Marking**: Only `p0` has a token initially.

### How `pd` and `pe` Can Be Marked:
- `pd` can be marked in two ways:
  - Via the "shortcut" path: `T1 → T2b` (skips `pc` and `T3`).
  - Via the "normal" path: `T1 → T2 → T3` (requires `T3` to fire first).
- `pe` is marked only by `T4`, which requires `pb` (produced by `T1`).

### Can `pd` and `pe` Be Marked Without `T3` Firing?
Yes! The "shortcut" path (`T1 → T2b`) marks `pd` directly from `pa`, bypassing `pc` and `T3`. Meanwhile, `pe` is marked by `T4` (which fires independently after `T1`).

### Shortest Firing Sequence Where T5 Fires Before T3:
Here is the sequence:
1. `T1` (fires from `p0`, marks `pa` and `pb`).
2. `T2b` (fires from `pa`, marks `pd` via the shortcut).
3. `T4` (fires from `pb`, marks `pe`).
4. `T5` (fires from `pd` and `pe`, marks `pf`).

At this point, `T3` has **not yet fired**, and `T5` has already fired.

### Why This Works:
- The shortcut (`T2b`) allows `pd` to be marked without `T3`.
- `pe` is marked independently by `T4`.
- Thus, `T5` can fire as soon as both `pd` and `pe` are marked, which can happen before `T3` fires.

### Final Answer:
**Yes**, it is possible. One shortest firing sequence where `T5` fires before `T3` is:
`T1 → T2b → T4 → T5`.
