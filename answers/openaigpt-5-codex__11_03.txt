Subject: Actions on SLA-breaching bottlenecks  

Legal Approval averages 900 seconds per case, breaching the 600-second SLA by 300 seconds and incurring the longest waiting time in the chain at 600 seconds. Risk Review requires 600 seconds versus the 300-second SLA, exceeding targets by 300 seconds and forcing applicants to queue for 480 seconds. Credit Assessment averages 300 seconds, 60 seconds above its 240-second SLA, and keeps cases idle for 200 seconds. These three activities account for the only SLA breaches and the highest waiting times, creating a cascading constraint on downstream throughput.  

• Reduce Legal Approval’s 600-second queue by temporarily assigning cross-trained legal analysts during peak periods so average throughput can shrink the 300-second breach back inside the 600-second SLA.  
• Introduce a pre-risk triage to fast-track low-risk cases, cutting into the 480-second waits and the 300-second SLA overrun in Risk Review.  
• Automate document verification within Credit Assessment to trim the 200-second wait and close the 60-second gap over the 240-second SLA.
