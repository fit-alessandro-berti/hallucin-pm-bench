**Answer:** No  

**Justification:**  
- **Rule 1**: ❌ Violated – `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` occurs *after* `Notify_Authorities`, so QE and RA are not in the required order (`QE` → `RA`).  
- **Rule 2** *(severity = High)*: ✔ Correct – `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3**: ❌ Violated – `Notify_Authorities` happens before RA is complete, violating the requirement that NA only occur after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 4**: ✔ Correct – `Close_Case` occurs after NA and after VP (since VP was required).  

Overall, because Rules 1 and 3 are broken, the trace is **non‑compliant**.
