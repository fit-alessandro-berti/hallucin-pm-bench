### Decision Points in Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   - Decision: If the risk scores from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B** differ by **≤ 2 points**, continue to **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.  
   - Else, escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision, then continue.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   - Decision: If the loan amount is **< €15 000**, the system auto-approves and proceeds to **Disburse Funds**.  
   - If the loan amount is **≥ €15 000**, proceed to **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.
