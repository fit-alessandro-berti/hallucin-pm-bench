No.

Justification:
- Rule 1: Violated. QE and RA occurred, but not in the required order (QE then RA).
- Rule 2: Satisfied. Severity is High, and VP occurred after both QE and RA (although the order of QE and RA was incorrect).
- Rule 3: Violated. NA occurred before RA was complete.
- Rule 4: Satisfied. CC occurred after NA and VP.
