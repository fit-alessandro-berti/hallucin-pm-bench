It is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval because Artefact A contains only the event log header with all data rows and timestamp values redacted for privacy, leaving no actual start or complete times to analyze. Consequently, no statistical calculations are possible on the provided stub, and Artefact B offers only historical SLA targets and a past average for a different process interval rather than the granular instance-level data required for this audit.
