Let’s reason step by step from the initial marking.

---

**Initial marking:**  
\( p0 = 1 \), others \( 0 \).

---

**Step 1 — Firing T1**  
T1: \( p0 \to pa, pb \)  
Marking after T1: \( pa = 1, pb = 1, p0 = 0 \), others \( 0 \).

---

**Step 2 — Possible transitions from here**  
From \( pa=1, pb=1 \):

- **T2**: \( pa \to pc \) → marking: \( pc=1, pb=1 \)
- **T2b**: \( pa \to pd \) → marking: \( pd=1, pb=1 \)
- **T4**: \( pb \to pe \) → marking: \( pa=1, pe=1 \)

---

**Goal:** T5 before T3.  
T5 needs \( pd \) and \( pe \) tokens.  
T3 needs \( pc \) token.

So to avoid T3 before T5, we must avoid creating \( pc \) before T5 fires.

---

**Step 3 — Try to get T5 enabled without T3 ever firing before it**  

From \( pa=1, pb=1 \):

Option:  
1. Fire **T2b** (\( pa \to pd \)) → marking: \( pd=1, pb=1 \)  
2. Fire **T4** (\( pb \to pe \)) → marking: \( pd=1, pe=1 \)  

Now T5 is enabled (\( pd=1, pe=1 \)).  

Fire **T5** (\( pd, pe \to pf \)) → marking: \( pf=1 \).

---

**Step 4 — Check if T3 has fired**  
T3 never fired in this sequence.  
Sequence: **T1, T2b, T4, T5** — length 4.

---

**Step 5 — Verify no shorter sequence**  
We need T5 enabled: requires \( pd \) and \( pe \).  
From initial:  
- T1 (1 step) → \( pa, pb \)  
- Need \( pd \): either T2b (from \( pa \)) or T3 (from \( pc \)), but T3 requires T2 first, which makes \( pc \), which we don’t want before T5. So T2b is the only way to get \( pd \) without T3.  
- Need \( pe \): T4 from \( pb \).  

So minimal: T1, T2b, T4, T5.  
That’s 4 steps.  
No shorter because T5 needs two tokens from different branches, each requiring at least one step after T1.

---

**Conclusion:** Yes, it is possible.

---

**Final answer:**

**Yes**, it is possible.

Shortest firing sequence:  
\[
T1 \to T2b \to T4 \to T5
\]
