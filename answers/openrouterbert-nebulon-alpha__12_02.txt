The stated fact is inaccurate because *Validate_Payment* does not always follow *Receive_Order* in the log. For case **C003** (lines 6–7), *Validate_Payment* occurs **before** *Receive_Order*, violating the claimed sequence. Additionally, case **C005** (lines 11–12) shows *Validate_Payment* leading directly to *Cancel_Order* without any intervening *Receive_Order*. These counterexamples disprove the universal claim.
