We first note that after the initial marking (p0 = 1), the only enabled transition is T1. Firing T1 produces tokens in both pa and pb. From there, there are two ways to “use” the token in pa:

• T2, which produces a token in pc and then typically leads to T3 (pc → pd), or  
• T2b, which is a shortcut that directly produces a token in pd without going through pc.

Meanwhile, T4 can consume the token in pb to produce a token in pe. Since T5 requires tokens in both pd and pe, you can enable T5 by taking the shortcut T2b (to get pd) rather than T2 (which would later enable T3).

Thus, the shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before any occurrence of T3 is:

1. T1 (p0 → pa, pb)
2. T2b (pa → pd)
3. T4 (pb → pe)
4. T5 (pd + pe → pf)

In this sequence, T3 need not occur at all. Therefore, it is indeed possible for T5 to fire before T3 in a reachable marking.
