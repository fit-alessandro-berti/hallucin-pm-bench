**Answer:** No

**Justification:**  
- **Case C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Pack_Items` → `Validate_Payment`. Here, `Validate_Payment` does not immediately follow `Receive_Order`; `Pack_Items` occurs in between.  
- **Case C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` → `Check_Fraud` → `Validate_Payment`. Here, `Validate_Payment` does not immediately follow `Receive_Order`; `Check_Fraud` occurs in between.  

These cases violate the stated fact that `Validate_Payment` always occurs immediately after `Receive_Order` with no other activities in between.
