Subject: Urgent Process Remediation – Critical SLA Breaches

Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment are the three worst‑performing activities, exhibiting both severe SLA breaches and excessive waiting times. Legal Approval averages 900 seconds against a 600‑second SLA, exceeding it by 300 seconds with 600 seconds of waiting. Risk Review averages 600 seconds versus a 300‑second SLA, exceeding it by 300 seconds with 480 seconds of waiting. Credit Assessment averages 300 seconds against a 240‑second SLA, exceeding it by 60 seconds with 200 seconds of waiting.

• Legal Approval: Reduce the 600‑second waiting time for the 465 cases by adding reviewers or implementing parallel pre‑screening.  
• Risk Review: Cut the 480‑second wait for 480 cases by reallocating capacity from Draft Offer (which has only 30 seconds of waiting) or introducing risk‑tiered fast tracks.  
• Credit Assessment: Lower the 200‑second waiting time across 1 175 cases through automated data pre‑fetching or additional assessor shifts.
