**Subject:** Executive Briefing: Claim Processing Waiting Time Reduction

Our analysis of claim processing over the last 12 months indicates significant waiting times. The three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:

1.  **Request Documents:** Avg. waiting time: 36.5h; 95th percentile: 120.0h. **Recommendation:** Implement automated document verification for common claim types to reduce this wait by 20% (save 7.3h).
2.  **Assess Liability:** Avg. waiting time: 7.8h; 95th percentile: 16.4h. **Recommendation:** Develop clear, standardized assessment guidelines and training for adjusters to cut waits by 20% (save 1.6h).
3.  **Approve Payment:** Avg. waiting time: 3.2h; 95th percentile: 9.7h. **Recommendation:** Streamline the approval workflow by empowering supervisors to approve payments up to a higher threshold, reducing waits by 20% (save 0.6h).
