**Executive Memo – Process Performance Analysis**  

Based on current operational metrics, the three worst-performing activities—measured jointly by SLA breaches and high waiting times—are **Risk Review**, **Legal Approval**, and **Credit Assessment**.  

- **Risk Review** averages 600 seconds throughput (300 seconds above its 300-second SLA) with a waiting time of 480 seconds, the second-highest delay in the process.  
- **Legal Approval** averages 900 seconds throughput (300 seconds above its 600-second SLA) and has the highest waiting time at 600 seconds.  
- **Credit Assessment** averages 300 seconds throughput (60 seconds above its 240-second SLA) with a waiting time of 200 seconds, making it the third longest delay outside SLA.  

To improve performance and SLA compliance:  

- **Risk Review:** Introduce parallel pre-assessment steps to reduce bottlenecks before formal review.  
- **Legal Approval:** Implement workload balancing across approvers to cut queue times.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Standardize assessment templates to speed evaluation and reduce rework.
