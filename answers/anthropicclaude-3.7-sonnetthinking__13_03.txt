### 2️⃣ Why Manual Fraud Check Frequency Might Be Misestimated

An analyst viewing only this limited snippet would likely misestimate manual fraud check frequency due to:
- Small sample size (only 3 cases, 14 events)
- Single-day data (March 1st only)
- Inconsistent naming conventions (note "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)")
- Process variations (some applications go through different verification paths)
- Selection bias (these three cases may not represent typical distribution)
- Time-of-day patterns (this period might have atypical manual review rates)
- Incomplete view of full process variants

Without the complete dataset, any frequency estimate lacks statistical validity.
