To the COO, our pipeline review shows three steps that breach SLA targets and have the longest waits. Legal Approval exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (actual 900 s vs target 600 s) with a 600‑second wait. Risk Review exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (actual 600 s vs target 300 s) and waits 480 seconds. Credit Assessment exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds (actual 300 s vs target 240 s) while waiting 200 seconds. These gaps are the largest in the process.

- Deploy automated triage routing cases with actual processing >600 seconds to a fast‑track team, targeting exceedance under 30 seconds (Draft Offer wait).  
- Add a real‑time alert for risk‑review cases projected to exceed 480 seconds, and assign an extra analyst to cap exceedance at 80 seconds (Verify Identity wait).  
- Add an extra assessor when waiting time hits 200 seconds, aiming to reduce exceedance to within 15 seconds (Customer Acceptance wait).
