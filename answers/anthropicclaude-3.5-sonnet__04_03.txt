**No**, the trace is not compliant.

Justification by rule:

1. Rule 1 ✗ VIOLATED: While both QE and RA occur once each, they are not in the correct order. The trace shows QE followed by NA, then RA, when QE must be followed directly by RA.

2. Rule 2 ✓ SATISFIED: VP occurs after both QE and RA as required for high severity cases.

3. Rule 3 ✗ VIOLATED: NA occurs between QE and RA, when it should only occur after both QE and RA are complete.

4. Rule 4 ✓ SATISFIED: CC occurs after both NA and VP.

The main violations are in the sequencing of NA, which occurred too early before RA was complete, and in the incorrect ordering of QE and RA reviews.
