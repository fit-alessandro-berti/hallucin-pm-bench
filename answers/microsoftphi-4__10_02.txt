### RACI Definitions:
- **R (Responsible):** The person who does the work to complete the task. Completes the task or responsible for the output.
- **A (Accountable):** The person who is ultimately answerable and accountable for the task. Often the one who delegates the work to others.
- **C (Consulted):** The people whose opinions are sought; typically subject matter experts and stakeholders.
- **I (Informed):** The people who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable, and who need to be aware of the task's progress or completion.
