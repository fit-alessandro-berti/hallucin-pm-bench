**Answer:** No

**Justification:**
The FACT claims that **"Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," with no other activities in between**. However, the event-log excerpt contains counterexamples where this is not true:

1. **CaseID C002**:
   Sequence: `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`
   Here, **"Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment"**, violating the FACT.

2. **CaseID C004**:
   Sequence: `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment`
   Here, **"Check_Fraud" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment"**, violating the FACT.

Only **CaseID C001** and **CaseID C003** follow the pattern `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment` directly, but the existence of other cases disproves the universal claim.
