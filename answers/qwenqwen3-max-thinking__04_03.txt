**No**

**Justification:**

- **Rule 1 violated**: QE and RA must occur **in that order** (QE before RA). In the trace, `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, which satisfies the ordering—but **both must occur once each**, which they do. However, **Rule 3** is also impacted by this sequence, so we examine further.

- **Rule 3 violated**: `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must **not occur until after both QE and RA** are complete. In the trace, NA occurs **after QE but before RA**, which violates this rule.

- **Rule 2 conditionally applies** (severity = "High"), so `VP_Safety_Approval` must occur **after both QE and RA**. VP does occur after both in the trace, so **Rule 2 is satisfied**.

- **Rule 4 violated**: `Close_Case` may occur only after NA **and**, for high severity, after VP. Although VP and NA both occur before CC, **NA itself was premature** (violating Rule 3), which indirectly taints compliance of Rule 4; more directly, since NA is a prerequisite for CC and NA was executed out of order, the process leading to CC is non-compliant.

**Primary violation**: Rule 3 (NA occurs before RA). This also undermines the validity of Rule 4. Thus, the trace is **non-compliant**.
