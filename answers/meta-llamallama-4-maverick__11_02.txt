**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review**

To: COO, Acme Insurance

The Q1-2025 Claims Handling performance dashboard highlights areas for improvement. Based on the data, the three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Request_Documents**: High `avg_wait_time_min` (150 minutes) and `rework_rate_pct` (22.0%) indicate inefficiencies. To improve, **streamline the document request process** by reducing the number of cases that require rework.
2. **Review_Documents**: High `avg_processing_time_min` (25 minutes) and `stdev_processing_time_min` (9 minutes) suggest variability in processing time. To address this, **standardize the document review process** to reduce processing time variability.
3. **Initial_Assessment**: High `avg_wait_time_min` (18 minutes) and `sla_breach_pct` (3.2%) indicate potential bottlenecks. To improve, **reallocate resources** to reduce wait times and prevent SLA breaches.

These data-driven actions aim to enhance the overall Claims Handling process.

**Recommendations for implementation will be discussed separately.**
