**Q2**  
For case **C002**, the sequence of activities in chronological order (based on timestamps):  
- `Receive_Order` (line 2, 09:15:10)  
- `Check_Stock` (line 5, 09:22:55)  
- `Arrange_Delivery` (line 8, 10:15:20)  
- `Ship_Order` (line 10, 10:25:40)  

**Answer: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

**Q3**  
Activities that immediately precede `Ship_Order` across all cases:  
- **C001**: `Ship_Order` is preceded by `Check_Stock` (line 7, after line 3).  
- **C003**: `Ship_Order` is preceded by `Check_Stock` (line 9, after line 6).  
- **C002**: `Ship_Order` is preceded by `Arrange_Delivery` (line 10, after line 8).  

Distinct predecessors: `Arrange_Delivery`, `Check_Stock`.  
Alphabetically ordered: `Arrange_Delivery` (starts with "A") comes before `Check_Stock` (starts with "C").  

**Answer:**  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
