**1. Occurrences of “Manual_Fraud_Check”**

**2. Percentage of all logged events**  
- 1 ÷ 18 × 100 = 5.555…% → **5.56 %** (rounded to two decimal places)  

**3. Case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”**  
- **A1002**  

**4. Two sampling‑related reasons why a monthly frequency estimate based on this fragment is unreliable**

1. **Extremely small sample size** – Only 18 events (4 cases) are observed, and the manual fraud check occurs just once. With such a limited number of observations, the estimated rate is highly sensitive to random variation and does not provide a stable basis for inference.

2. **Lack of temporal representativeness** – The fragment covers a single day (2025‑05‑01). Manual fraud checks may vary by day‑of‑week, season, promotional periods, or other time‑dependent factors. Extrapolating from one day to an entire month ignores these potential fluctuations, leading to a potentially biased estimate.
