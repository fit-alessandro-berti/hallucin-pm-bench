# Analysis of Petri Net PN-8

## Question 1: Can T5 fire before T3?

**No**, it is not possible.

## Question 2: Explanation

T5 requires **two input tokens**: one from P2 and one from P5.

- P2 receives a token only when **T1 fires** (the AND-split from P0)
- P5 receives a token only when **T4 fires**
- T4 requires a token in P4
- P4 receives tokens from **either T7 or T3**

**Critical constraint**: T3 is the *only* transition that consumes the token from P2. If T5 were to fire before T3, P2 would still hold a token (needed for T5's input). But this token cannot exist in P4 simultaneously—T3 must fire to move P2's token to P4, enabling the chain T3 → T4 → T5.

Therefore, **T3 must fire before T5** in any valid execution.
