The data reveals three critical activities with severe SLA breaches and excessive waiting times:  

1. **Risk Review**: Avg throughput (600s) exceeds SLA (300s) by **100%**, with waiting time (480s) consuming 80% of total time.  
2. **Legal Approval**: Avg throughput (900s) exceeds SLA (600s) by **50%**, with waiting time (600s) dominating 67% of the process.  
3. **Credit Assessment**: Avg throughput (300s) exceeds SLA (240s) by **25%**, with waiting time (200s) representing 67% of total time.  

**Recommended actions:**  
- **Risk Review**: Implement parallel processing for low to reduce to reduce queue backlog, targeting a 30% waiting time reduction.  
- **Legal Approval**: Pre-validate standard contract templates to cut approval time by 25%, prioritizing high-volume cases.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Automate preliminary scoring for Tier 1 applicants to shrink waiting time by 40%, aligning with SLA.  

These actions address root causes (waiting time dominance) while leveraging existing case-volume data.
