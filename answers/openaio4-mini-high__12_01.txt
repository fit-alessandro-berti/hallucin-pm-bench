The claim is not accurate.  
– In case 1001 the order is  
  … → Update_Inventory (08:25:55) → Authorize_Refund (08:30:02) …  
  so “Authorize_Refund” does **not** occur before “Update_Inventory.”  
– In case 1002 there is no Update_Inventory at all; “Authorize_Refund” at 10:18:40 is followed by “Refund_Issued.”
