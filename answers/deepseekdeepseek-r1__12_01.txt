The fact is **not accurate**.  

**Justification**:  
- In **Case 1001**, the sequence is `Update_Inventory` (08:25:55) â†’ `Authorize_Refund` (08:30:02), directly contradicting the claim.  
- **Case 1003** includes `Update_Inventory` followed by `Quality_Check` and later `Authorize_Refund`, further disproving the "immediately before" requirement.  

The data shows `Authorize_Refund` occurs *after* `Update_Inventory` when both are present.
