2) Reasons an analyst could misestimate from this snippet:
- Very small, early-time slice: only 3 cases over a few morning hours on 2025-03-01; the month-long log is likely far larger.
- Incomplete case progression: activities later in these cases (including any manual fraud checks) aren’t visible here.
- Naming inconsistency is evident: automatic checks appear as both “Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)”. Similar variants for manual checks elsewhere could be missed if filtering by the exact string.
- Rework occurs (“Send Offer” and “Approve Application” repeat), implying activities can recur; manual fraud checks could also repeat outside this excerpt.
