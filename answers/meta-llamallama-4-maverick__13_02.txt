I'll answer your questions based on the provided log excerpt.

1. The activity **"Manual_Fraud_Check"** occurs **1** time in the excerpt (for case C05).

2. 
   a) To calculate the percentage of all events that include "Manual_Fraud_Check", I'll divide the number of times it occurs (1) by the total number of events (48) and multiply by 100: (1/48) * 100 = **2.08%**.
   b) To calculate the percentage of all unique cases that include "Manual_Fraud_Check", I'll divide the number of cases with this activity (1, which is C05) by the total number of unique cases (12) and multiply by 100: (1/12) * 100 = **8.33%**.

3. The low-support activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" can mislead performance or predictive analyses if generalised from this slice because it may be underrepresented or overrepresented in the larger dataset. Its infrequent occurrence (only once in 12 cases) might not accurately reflect its true frequency or importance in the overall process, potentially leading to biased or incomplete conclusions.
