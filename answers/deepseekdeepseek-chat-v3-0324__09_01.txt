### Answer:  

1) **The average cycle time of "Review Contract" cannot be derived** from the provided data.  

2) **Explanation**: The log does not include timestamp or elapsed-time information for activities (these fields were redacted). Without duration data for "Review Contract" or any other activity in this log, it is impossible to calculate cycle times. Historical benchmarks from a different customer segment (FY-2023) cannot be applied here, as they are explicitly stated to be unrelated to this dataset.  

(Note: The system acknowledges that cycle time typically requires timestamps or precomputed durations â€” neither is available here.)
