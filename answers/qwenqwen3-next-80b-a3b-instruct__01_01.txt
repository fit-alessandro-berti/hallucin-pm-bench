Here is a precise summary of **every decision point** and the **required documents** in Contoso Airlines‚Äô flight-refund process, strictly based on the defined process and constraints:

---

### ‚úÖ **Decision Points**

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision**: Is the claim eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?  
   - *This is a gate: if ineligible, the process terminates here. If eligible, it proceeds.*

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   - **Decision**: Does the claim meet all criteria on the *EligibilityChecklist*?  
   - *This is a gate: if not approved, the process terminates. If approved, it proceeds.*

3. **High-value branch check** (implicit after Finance_Controller_PreApprove)  
   - **Decision**: Is the refund amount **greater than ‚Ç¨1,000**?  
   - *This is a binary branching decision:*
     - **Yes** ‚Üí Route to **Senior_Auditor_Review**
     - **No** ‚Üí Skip Senior_Auditor_Review and proceed to **Process_Refund_Payment**

4. **Senior_Auditor_Review** *(only if high-value)*  
   - **Decision**: Is the *AuditTrail* complete and valid?  
   - *This is a gate: if the audit trail is incomplete or invalid, the process halts. If valid, it proceeds.*

5. **Process_Refund_Payment** *(conditional on prior approvals)*  
   - **Decision**: Is the *BankTransferAuthorization* signed and present?  
   - *This is a gate: payment is executed only if the document is present and all prior approvals (Finance_Controller_PreApprove + Senior_Auditor_Review if applicable) have succeeded.*
