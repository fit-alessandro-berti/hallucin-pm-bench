The fact is **not accurate**. 

In Case 1001, **Update_Inventory** (2025-03-01 08:25:55) occurs *before* **Authorize_Refund** (2025-03-01 08:30:02). In Case 1003, **Update_Inventory** (2025-03-03 10:08:07) is followed by Quality_Check, then **Authorize_Refund** (2025-03-03 10:22:18), meaning Update_Inventory again precedes Authorize_Refund. There are **no instances** where Authorize_Refund occurs immediately before Update_Inventory. Case 1002 lacks Update_Inventory entirely, but the claimâ€™s "always" fails due to the observed order in cases where Update_Inventory exists.
