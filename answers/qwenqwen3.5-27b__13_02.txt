3. This excerpt contains only 12 cases, making the single occurrence of "Manual_Fraud_Check" an outlier rather than a stable pattern. Generalizing this slice suggests manual intervention is more common than it likely is, distorting process maps and performance metrics if this path differs from the dominant automated flow. Predictive models risk overfitting to this anomaly, leading to inaccurate forecasts for the broader population. Consequently, resource allocation or efficiency decisions based on this low-support data may misrepresent the true process behavior, treating an exception as a standard variant.
