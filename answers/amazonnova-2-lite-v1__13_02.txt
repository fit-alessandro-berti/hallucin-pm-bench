   b) all *unique cases* (12 in total)  
   include that activity?  Round to *two decimals*.**

There are **48 total events** and **12 unique cases** in the excerpt.

##### a) Percentage of all *events* that include the activity “Manual\_Fraud\_Check”:

- The activity “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” occurs **1 time** out of **48 total events**.
- Percentage = (1 / 48) * 100 = **2.08%**

##### b) Percentage of all *unique cases* that include the activity “Manual\_Fraud\_Check”:

#### 3. In ≤100 words, explain why such a low-support activity can mislead performance or predictive analyses if we generalise from this slice.

Generalising from this small slice risks **overfitting** or **misrepresenting** overall process behaviour. Since “Manual\_Fraud\_Check” appears in only 1 out of 12 cases (8.33%) and 1 out of 48 events (2.08%), assuming it is a common or significant step could skew performance metrics or predictive models. Rare activities might be exceptions, not norms; overemphasising them may misallocate resources or produce inaccurate forecasts if the sample isn't representative of the full population.
