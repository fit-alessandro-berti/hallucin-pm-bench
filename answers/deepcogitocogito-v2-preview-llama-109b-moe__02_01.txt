Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the given event log fragment. I'll start by dissecting each event to extract the necessary information.

**Q1: How many distinct case IDs appear in the fragment?**

Looking at the case ID attributes in each event, I see:
- A-9321 appears in events 1, 2, 5, 8.
- B-1045 appears in events 3, 4, 6, 7.
- C-77 appears in event 10.

That's three distinct case IDs.

**Q2: Which activity immediately precedes "Ship_Order" in case A-9321?**

For case A-9321, the events in order are:
1. Receive_Order
2. Validate_Order
3. Pack_Items
4. Ship_Order

So the activity right before Ship_Order is Pack_Items.

**Q3: What is the earliest timestamp in the fragment?**

I'll list all timestamps:
- 08:02:00 (A-9321)
- 08:16:00 (A-9321)
- 08:05:00 (B-1045)
- 08:17:00 (B-1045)
- 09:01:00 (A-9321)
- 08:45:00 (B-1045)
- 09:10:00 (B-1045)
- 09:20:00 (A-9321)
- 09:25:00 (B-1045)
- 10:00:00 (C-77)

The earliest is 08:02:00.

**Q4: How many times does the activity "Quality_Check" occur?**

Checking each event's concept:name:
- Quality_Check occurs in events 6 and 10. So twice.

**Q5: List every activity that never appears as the first event of any case.**

Looking at first events for each case:
- A-9321: Receive_Order (first event)
- B-1045: Receive_Order (first event)
- C-77: Quality_Check (is it the first? Wait, this seems to be the only event for C-77, but since it's a separate case, this is its first (and only) event.)

Now, list activities that don't appear as the first event in any case. The first events are Receive_Order (A-9321, B-1045) and Quality_Check (C-77). So activities not seen first at all would be Validate_Order, Pack_Items, and Ship_Order. 

Wait, need to cross-verify. For case C-77, only an event with Quality_Check exists. So Quality_Check is the first event here. Therefore, activity that never appear as first: Validate, Pack, Ship.

Wait, but what about case B-1045? Its first event is Receive_Order. Check if any cases start with other events. No, so yes, Validate_Order, Pack_Items, and Ship_Order are the ones never appearing as first events.
Let me analyze the event log fragment meticulously:

```json
{
  "Q1": 3,
  "Q2": "Pack_Items",
  "Q3": "2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00",
  "Q4": 2,
  "Q5": ["Validate_Order", "Pack_Items", "Ship_Order"]
}
```

Here's my analysis:

**Q1**: Looking at the case IDs, I see A-9321, B-1045, and C-77, making 3 distinct cases.

**Q2**: For case A-9321, tracing the sequence: Receive_Order → Validate_Order → Pack_Items → Ship_Order. So Pack_Items immediately precedes Ship_Order.

**Q3**: Comparing all timestamps in the fragment, 2025-04-14T08:02:00.000+00:00 (first event of A-9321) is the earliest.

**Q4**: "Quality_Check" appears twice - once in B-1045 and once in C-77.

**Q5**: Looking at first events for each case:
- A-9321 starts with Receive_Order
- B-1045 starts with Receive_Order
- C-77 starts with Quality_Check

Therefore, Validate_Order, Pack_Items, and Ship_Order never appear as first events in any case.
