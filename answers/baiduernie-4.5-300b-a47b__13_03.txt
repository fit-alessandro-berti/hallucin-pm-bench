1️⃣ The activity “Manual Fraud Check” occurs **1 time** in the excerpt (CaseID 1002, Timestamp 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate the frequency of “Manual Fraud Check” because the excerpt spans only March 1st with a small sample (3 cases). It lacks variation in fraud-check types (e.g., no other “Manual Fraud Check” entries) and timing patterns. If the full log contains many more cases—including cases processed without manual checks, cases on other days, or cases where the field name differs (e.g., “Manual Review for Fraud”)—extrapolating from the snippet would be unreliable. Noise, edge-case filtering, or naming inconsistencies could also skew conclusions.
