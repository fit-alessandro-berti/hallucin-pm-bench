Add a **timer start event** (e.g., "Start_Timer") linked to the "Claim Submitted" start event and modeled with a **timer intermediate catch event** on the outgoing flow to "Triage Claim". This timer will enforce the 48-hour SLA by triggering an escalation if the flow is not taken within the specified time.

**Answer in plain English (≤120 words):**  
To enforce the 48-hour SLA without adding tasks, modify the flow from "Task_Check" to "Task_Triage" (id: f5) by adding a **timer intermediate catch event** with a 48-hour deadline. This ensures if "Docs complete?" (GW_Docs) leads to "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage) beyond 48h, the timer triggers auto-escalation.
