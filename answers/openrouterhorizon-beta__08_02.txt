Answer 1: No.

Answer 2: Impossible. T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5. The only way to put a token in P5 is via T4, which needs a token in P4. P4 can only be marked by T3 (from P2) or T7 after T2 (from P1→P3→P4). However, even if P4 is marked via P1-branch (T2,T7), T4 only consumes P4 and produces P5; it does not consume P2. Thus, to enable T5 we must still have a token in P2, and the only producer of P4 from the P2-branch is T3. Therefore, before T5 can fire, P2 must remain marked and T3 need not have fired, but T5 cannot precede T3 because T3 is not required? Correction: Actually, T5 firing does not require T3 to have fired, so T5 can fire before T3 if P5 is produced via T7/T4 and P2 still holds its token. Minimal sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.
