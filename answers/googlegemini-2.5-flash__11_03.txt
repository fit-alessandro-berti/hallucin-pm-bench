Subject: Critical Process Performance Update: Activities Requiring Immediate Attention

Observations from our latest process data indicate three activities significantly impacting overall efficiency due to SLA breaches and high waiting times. Legal Approval is a primary concern, with an average throughput time of 900 seconds, exceeding its 600-second target SLA by 300 seconds, while experiencing 600 seconds of average waiting time. Risk Review also breaches its SLA by 300 seconds (600s throughput vs. 300s target), marked by 480 seconds of average waiting time. Finally, Credit Assessment's 300-second throughput time surpasses its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, recording 200 seconds of average waiting time.

To address these critical bottlenecks:
*   For Legal Approval, prioritize actions to reduce its 600 seconds of average waiting time.
*   For Risk Review, implement strategies to decrease its 480 seconds of average waiting time.
*   For Credit Assessment, focus efforts on optimizing to reduce its 200 seconds of average waiting time.
