Non-compliant  
1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity 4), which requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. However, `Risk_Assessment` (activity 9) occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` (activity 8), violating the requirement.  
2. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (activity 6), `Three_way_match` (activity 10) must occur within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). Instead, it occurs four activities later (positions 6 → 10), exceeding the allowed distance.  
3. **Rule 1 compliance**: The PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, and approvals by `Procurement_Officer` (activity 2) and `CFO` (activity 3) occur **before** `Issue_PO` (activity 5), satisfying Rule 1.  
4. **Rule 4 compliance**: No `Intern` activity directly follows a `CFO` activity. The `CFO` activity (activity 3) is followed by `Expedite_Flag` (activity 4, role: `System`), and the next `Intern` activity (activity 7) is not directly after `CFO`.  
5. **Rule 5 compliance**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (activity 11), with no subsequent activities, satisfying Rule 5.  

The violations of Rules 2 and 3 render the trace **non-compliant**.
