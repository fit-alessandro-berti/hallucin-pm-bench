I'm being asked to create a RACI matrix for FinCo's order-to-cash workflow. First, let me understand what RACI stands for:

- Responsible: The person or role accountable for the task
- Accountable: The person or role who ultimately owns the task (usually one person)
- Consulted: The person or role who provides input or expertise
- Informed: The person or role who needs to be notified of progress or outcomes

Given that I'm a senior process-mapping consultant, I need to ensure I follow the vocabulary policy strictly:

1. Use "KYC Review" instead of "Customer Due Diligence"
2. Use "Order Vetting" instead of "Order Validation"
3. Use "Payment Clearance" instead of "Payment Processing"

Now, let me map each activity to the correct RACI:

1. Receive Application:
- Responsible: Account Manager (AM)
- Accountable: Account Manager (AM)
- Consulted: None
- Informed: None

2. KYC Review:
- Responsible: Compliance Officer (CO)
- Accountable: Compliance Officer (CO)
- Consulted: None
- Informed: None

3. Order Vetting:
- Responsible: Account Manager (AM)
- Accountable: Account Manager (AM)
- Consulted: None
- Informed: None

4. Payment Clearance:
- Responsible: Finance Clerk (FC)
- Accountable: Finance Clerk (FC)
- Consulted: None
- Informed: None

5. Record Update:
- Responsible: IT Support (IT)
- Accountable: IT Support (IT)
- Consulted: None
- Informed: None

6. Notify Customer:
- Responsible: Account Manager (AM)
- Accountable: Account Manager (AM)
- Consulted: None
- Informed: Customer

Now I'll create the RACI matrix with the correct terminology.
# RACI Matrix for FinCo's Order-to-Cash Workflow

| Activity | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application | R, A | - | - | - |
| KYC Review | - | R, A | - | - |
| Order Vetting | R, A | - | - | - |
| Payment Clearance | - | - | R, A | - |
| Record Update | - | - | - | R, A |
| Notify Customer | R, A | - | - | - |

**Legend:**
- R = Responsible
- A = Accountable
- - = Not involved

Note: The RACI matrix assigns roles based on the process activities using the preferred terminology (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance).
