1.  The trace violates Rule 2. Because the trace contains the activity `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), the rule mandates that `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In this trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8, but `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at event #9, which is a direct violation of the required order.
