No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in any reachable marking. 

Formal explanation:
1. Transition T1 must fire to enable transitions T2 or T2b, as they are both dependent on place `pa`.
2. Transition T2 or T2b must fire to produce token(s) in place `pc` or `pd`, respectively.
3. Transition T3 can only fire after place `pc` has tokens, which means either T2 or T2b must have fired first.
4. Transition T4 can only fire after place `pb` has a token.
5. Transition T5 can only fire after places `pd` and `pe` have tokens.
6. Transition T6 can only fire after place `pf` has a token.

Based on these dependencies, the firing sequence for T3 must come before the firing sequence for T5 in any reachable marking.
