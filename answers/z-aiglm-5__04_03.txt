**No**

**Justification:**

*   **Rule 1 (Satisfied):** `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`, and both appear exactly once.
*   **Rule 2 (Satisfied):** Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` correctly occurs after both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
*   **Rule 3 (Violated):** `Notify_Authorities` occurs immediately after `Quality_Engineer_Review` but **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`. The rule requires it to occur after *both* are complete.
*   **Rule 4 (Satisfied):** `Close_Case` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
