1. Cannot compute the average cycle time for the activity "Approve Invoice" (in hours).

2. Cannot provide the standard deviation or a 95% confidence interval.

3. The required metrics (average cycle time, standard deviation, and confidence interval) for the activity "Approve Invoice" cannot be computed because Artefact A—the Event-Log Stub—contains only column headers and explicitly states that every row, event data, and all timestamp values (*start_time* and *complete_time*) have been removed for privacy. Cycle time is calculated by determining the duration between an event's start time and its complete time, and no such data is present in the provided materials.
