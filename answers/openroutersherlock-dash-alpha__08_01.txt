**No.**

**Proof:** T5 requires p3 ≥ 1 and p4 = 0 (via inhibitor arc). The only way to reach p3 ≥ 1 is via T2, which requires T1 to fire first. T1 also produces a token in p2. Thus, whenever p3 ≥ 1, we have p2 ≥ 1 (since the net is safe). T3 is the only consumer of p2, so p4 = 0 only if T3 has fired. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3.
