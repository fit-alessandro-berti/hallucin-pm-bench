1) **Average cycle time of “Review Contract” (hours): _Cannot be derived from the provided data_.**

2) **Why:**  
To compute an average cycle time for an activity, we need (per occurrence) either:
- a **start and end timestamp** for “Review Contract”, or  
- a **duration/elapsed-time field** recorded for that activity.

In the excerpted log you provided, the **timestamp and elapsed-time fields are explicitly redacted**, and only `case_id`, `activity`, and `resource` are shown. Therefore, while we can count occurrences of “Review Contract” (it appears in cases C-001, C-002, C-003, C-004 in the header), we **cannot calculate how long each took**, and thus **cannot compute an average duration in hours**.
