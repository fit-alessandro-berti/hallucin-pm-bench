1. The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs one time in this fragment.

2. There are 18 records in this fragment; “Manual_Fraud_Check” appears only once.
   Percentage = (1/18) * 100 = 5.56%

3. The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is A1002.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why estimating the monthly frequency from this fragment would be unreliable:

   - **Small Sample Size:** This fragment contains only 4 cases over the course of a single day. Such a limited dataset may not be representative of the full monthly operation.
   - **Lack of Completeness:** The fragment shows activity for less than 5 hours, and only a subset of cases includes a manual fraud check (1 out of 4). This limited scope introduces potential for substantial bias if applied across a full month’s volume.
