Based on the provided event-log fragment, the fact “In GalaxyRetail’s returns process, the activity ‘Authorize_Refund’ always occurs immediately before ‘Update_Inventory’ within the same case” is NOT accurate.

Justification:
- In **Case 1001**, "Update_Inventory" (timestamp 2025-03-01 08:25:55) occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund" (timestamp 2025-03-01 08:30:02).
- In **Case 1003**, "Update_Inventory" (timestamp 2025-03-03 10:08:07) also occurs BEFORE "Authorize_Refund" (timestamp 2025-03-03 10:22:18).

These cases contradict the fact that “Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory”. In both examples, “Update_Inventory” is performed earlier in the process.
