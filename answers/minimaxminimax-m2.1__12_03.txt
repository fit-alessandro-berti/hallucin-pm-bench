**Answer: No**

**Justification:**

The fact is **not accurate**. Examining the event log reveals two counterexamples where activities OTHER THAN "Validate_Payment" occur between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment":

**Case C002:**
- Receive_Order (09:30:00) → **Pack_Items** (09:50:00) → Validate_Payment (10:05:00)
- Here, "Pack_Items" interrupts the sequence between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment"

**Case C004:**
- Receive_Order (10:05:00) → **Check_Fraud** (10:07:00) → Validate_Payment (10:20:00)
- Here, "Check_Fraud" interrupts the sequence between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment"

While Cases C001 and C003 do show "Validate_Payment" occurring immediately after "Receive_Order," the presence of intervening activities in C002 and C004 disproves the claim that this pattern "always" occurs.
