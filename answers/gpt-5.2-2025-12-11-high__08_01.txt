Yes.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking \(M_0=(p0=1)\) is:
\[
T1 \;\rightarrow\; T2 \;\rightarrow\; T5
\]

Stepwise markings:

1. Fire **T1** (\(p0 \to p1+p2\)):
   \[
   M_1: \; p1=1,\; p2=1
   \]
2. Fire **T2** (\(p1 \to p3\)):
   \[
   M_2: \; p3=1,\; p2=1,\; p4=0
   \]
3. At \(M_2\), **T5** is enabled because it needs a token in **p3** and an inhibitor condition \(p4=0\). Since **T3** has not fired yet, **p4** is still empty. Fire **T5** (\(p3 \to p6\), inhibited by \(p4\)):
   \[
   M_3: \; p6=1,\; p2=1
   \]

Thus, **T5 fires before T3** in this reachable execution.
