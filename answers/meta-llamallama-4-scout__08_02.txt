## Step 1: Understand the Petri Net PN-8 and its Components
The Petri net PN-8 has places P0 to P6 and transitions T1 to T7. The initial marking is M0 = { P0 }. We need to analyze the behavior of transitions T3 and T5.

## 2: Analyze the Firing Conditions for T3 and T5
T3 fires if P2 has a token, and it produces a token in P4. T5 fires if P2 and P5 have tokens, producing a token in P6.

## 3: Determine the Reachability of T5 Firing Before T3
For T5 to fire before T3, P2 and P5 must have tokens before T3 fires. T1 produces tokens in P1 and P2. T2 and T3 can then fire based on their input places.

## 4: Examine the Firing Sequence
The sequence starts with T1, producing tokens in P1 and P2. Then, T3 can fire (since P2 has a token), producing a token in P4. After T4 fires, P5 gets a token. Now, T5 can fire because P2 and P5 have tokens.

## 5: Evaluate if T5 Can Fire Before T3
Given that T3 requires only P2 to fire and T5 requires P2 and P5, for T5 to fire before T3, P5 must be filled before T3. However, the path to fill P5 (T1 -> T3 -> T4) inherently requires T3 to fire first because P5 is filled after T4, which depends on T3 firing.

## 6: Conclusion for Question 1
Given the dependencies, T5 cannot fire before T3 because T3's firing is a prerequisite for filling P5, which is necessary for T5 to fire.

## 7: Bonus Question Analysis
Since T5 cannot fire before T3 due to the dependencies in the Petri net, there is no minimal firing sequence where T5 fires before T3.

The final answer is: $\boxed{No}$
