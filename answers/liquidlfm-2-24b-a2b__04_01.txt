**Compliant**

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1** – The PO amount is €12,300 (> €10,000), so two approvals are required:  
   - First by *Procurement Officer* (step 2) ✔️  
   - Second by *CFO* (step 3) ✔️  
   Both approvals are present (steps 2 and 3).

2. **Rule 2** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (step 4).  
   - `Quality_Check` is optional ✔️  
   - `Risk_Assessment` occurs before `Ship_Goods` (step 9 before step 8) ✔️

3. **Rule 3** – After `Goods_Received` (step 6), `Three_way_match` (step 10) occurs within the next two activities (steps 7 and 8) ✔️

4. **Rule 4** – No activity by *Intern* follows *CFO* directly:  
   - CFO at step 3, next activity is step 4 by *System* → OK ✔️

5. **Rule 5** – Trace ends with `Archive_Record` and nothing follows ✔️

All rules are satisfied.  

**Final Answer:** Compliant (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
