To determine whether transition \( T5 \) can fire before \( T3 \), we need to analyze the Petri net and check if there is a firing sequence that allows \( T5 \) to be enabled before \( T3 \).

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Marking**: \( p0 = 1 \), all other places are 0.

2. **Firing \( T1 \)**: 
   - **Input**: \( p0 = 1 \)
   - **Output**: \( pa = 1, pb = 1 \)
   - New marking: \( pa = 1, pb = 1 \)

3. **Possible Next Transitions**:
   - \( T2 \) (enabled with \( pa = 1 \))
   - \( T4 \) (enabled with \( pb = 1 \))
   - \( T2b \) (enabled with \( pa = 1 \))

4. **Consider \( T2b \) (shortcut path)**:
   - **Input**: \( pa = 1 \)
   - **Output**: \( pd = 1 \)
   - New marking: \( pb = 1, pd = 1 \)

5. **Consider \( T4 \)**:
   - **Input**: \( pb = 1 \)
   - **Output**: \( pe = 1 \)
   - New marking: \( pd = 1, pe = 1 \)

6. **Transition \( T5 \) (synchronizing join)**:
   - **Input**: \( pd = 1, pe = 1 \)
   - **Output**: \( pf = 1 \)
   - New marking: \( pf = 1 \)

7. **Sequence so far**: \( T1, T2b, T4, T5 \)

8. **Check \( T3 \)**:
   - \( T3 \) requires \( pc = 1 \) to fire. From the sequence above, \( pc \) is never marked because \( T2 \) was not fired.

### Conclusion:

The firing sequence \( T1 \rightarrow T2b \rightarrow T4 \rightarrow T5 \) allows \( T5 \) to fire before \( T3 \), as \( T3 \) is never enabled in this sequence. This is the shortest sequence that achieves the desired ordering.

### Shortest Firing Sequence:
\[ T1, T2b, T4, T5 \]

Thus, it is possible for \( T5 \) to fire before \( T3 \).
