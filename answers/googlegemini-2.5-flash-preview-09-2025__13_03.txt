Here are the answers strictly based on the provided event-log excerpt:

1️⃣ The exact activity string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs **1** time (in CaseID 1002).

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the commonality of manual fraud checks because of two key observations from the data:

First, different cases use different fraud checking activities (**"Automatic Fraud Check"** for 1001, **"Manual Fraud Check"** for 1002, and **"Fraud Check (Automatic)"** for 1003).

Second, the activity names for fraud checks are not standardized (e.g., "Automatic Fraud Check" vs. "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). If the full log contains similar variations that are functionally equivalent to a "Manual Fraud Check" but under a different name (e.g., "Manual Review - Fraud Step"), the analyst would only count the single exact mention, leading to an underestimation. Furthermore, the small sample size (3 cases) makes generalizing any frequency highly unreliable.
