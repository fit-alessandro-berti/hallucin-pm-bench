1. **Answer:** The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1 time** in the excerpt.

2. **Explanation:** An analyst reviewing only this snippet might misestimate the prevalence of manual fraud checks because the excerpt is a small, non-representative sample of a month-long log. It contains only three cases, and the frequency of manual fraud checks (1 out of 3 cases) may not reflect the broader trend. Additionally, the snippet lacks context about the total volume of applications processed, variations in fraud check methods across different loan types, or temporal patterns (e.g., manual checks might spike during certain periods). Without the full dataset, conclusions about the overall frequency of manual fraud checks would be unreliable.
