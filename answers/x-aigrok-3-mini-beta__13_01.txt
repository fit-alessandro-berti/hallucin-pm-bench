Below is a complete and accurate response to your questions based on the provided 18 log lines. I have analyzed the data strictly as per the instructions, without assuming or inferring any additional information.

1. **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
   The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs exactly 1 time in the fragment.

2. **What percentage of all logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
   There are 18 logged events in total. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs 1 time, so the percentage is (1 / 18) * 100 = 5.56%.

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  
   The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is A1002.

4. **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  
   - The fragment only includes events from a single day (2025-05-01), which is a limited time period and may not represent variations in activity frequency across an entire month.  
   - The sample size is very small, with only 18 events in total, making it insufficient to generalize or reliably extrapolate to a monthly frequency without additional data.
