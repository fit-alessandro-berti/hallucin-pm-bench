1. No  
2. The FACT is incorrect because there are two cases that contradict it:  
   - In CaseID **C002**, the sequence is:  
     **“Receive_Order” → “Pack_Items” → “Validate_Payment”**.  
     Here, “Validate_Payment” is not immediately after “Receive_Order”; “Pack_Items” occurs in between.  
   - In CaseID **C004**, the sequence is:  
     **“Receive_Order” → “Check_Fraud” → “Validate_Payment”**.  
     Again, “Validate_Payment” is not immediately after “Receive_Order”; “Check_Fraud” occurs in between.  

Thus, the FACT breaks in both C002 and C004 because another activity is interposed between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment.”
