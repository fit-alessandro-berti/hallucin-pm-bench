No, the fact is not accurate.

**Justification:**

*   In **Case 1001**, "Update_Inventory" occurs immediately *before* "Authorize_Refund".
*   In **Case 1003**, "Update_Inventory" occurs immediately *before* "Quality_Check", and "Authorize_Refund" occurs after "Quality_Check". "Authorize_Refund" does not occur immediately before "Update_Inventory".
