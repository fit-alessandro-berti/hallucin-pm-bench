facts:
- p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)
-initial marking
-T1 : p0 → p1 + p2
-T2 : p1 → p3
-T3 : p2 → p4
-T4 : p3 + p4 → p5
-T5 : p3 –|p4 → p6

The inhibitor arc to T5 requires that p4 contains zero tokens for T5 to fire. Since p4 initially has zero tokens, T5 cannot initially fire at any step.

Further, for T5 to fire after the initial marking, either T3 or a later transition must enable p4's decrease (p4 -> 0).

Suppose T2 fires, moving a token from p1 to p3: 
- p1(1), p3(0)

At this point, p4 still holds 0 tokens. Thus, T5 cannot fire since T5 requires that p4 have zero tokens.

Suppose T3 fires next, moving a token from p2 to p4:
- p2(0), p4(1)

Now, p4 contains a token, inhibiting T5. As T4 is still inactive without both p3 and p4 tokens, no other transition can empty p4 without setting p4 to 0.

At no further step in this initial evolution can p4 tokens be reduced to zero for T5 to fire. 

Thus, **T5 can never fire before T3 is able to do so**. 

An inhibitor arc prevents T5 from firing as long as p4 has any tokens, no matter the sequence of other transitions.

**Conclusion**: No firing sequence exists where T5 fires before T3. Therefore, in any reachable marking, T5 cannot fire before T3.
