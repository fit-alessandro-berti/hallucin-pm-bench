**Yes – it is reachable.**

**Concrete firing sequence**

| Step | Transition | Marking before firing (tokens in p0…p6) | Marking after firing |
|------|------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 0 | – | **M0** : (1,0,0,0,0,0,0) | – |
| 1 | **T1** | (1,0,0,0,0,0,0) | **M1** : (0,1,1,0,0,0,0) |
| 2 | **T2** | (0,1,1,0,0,0,0) | **M2** : (0,0,1,1,0,0,0) |
| 3 | **T5** | (0,0,1,1,0,0,0) | **M3** : (0,0,1,0,0,0,1) |
| 4 | **T3** | (0,0,1,0,0,0,1) | **M4** : (0,0,0,0,1,0,1) |

*Explanation*

* After **T1** the net contains tokens in the two “parallel” places `p1` and `p2`.  
* **T2** consumes the token in `p1` and produces a token in `p3`.  
* At marking **M2** place `p4` is still empty (no token has been produced from `p2` yet).  
  Therefore the inhibitor condition of **T5** (`p4 == 0`) is satisfied, and `p3` is present, so **T5** is enabled.  
* **T5** fires before **T3**, proving that it can indeed happen in a reachable marking.

Thus, transition **T5 can fire before transition T3** in this safe Petri net.
