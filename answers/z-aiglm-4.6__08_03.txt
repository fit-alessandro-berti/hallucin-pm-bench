Yes, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3**.

The key is the transition **T2b**, which provides a shortcut to place `pd`, allowing the prerequisites for T5 to be met without ever executing T3.

### Shortest Firing Sequence

A shortest firing sequence that achieves this is:

**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

### Formal Justification (Trace of Markings)

Here is a step-by-step trace of the markings to demonstrate that this sequence is valid and that T3 is not enabled before T5 fires.

1.  **Initial Marking:** M0 = {p0 = 1}
    *   Enabled transitions: {T1}

2.  **Fire T1:**
    *   Consumes: 1 token from p0
    *   Produces: 1 token in pa, 1 token in pb
    *   **New Marking M1:** {pa = 1, pb = 1}
    *   Enabled transitions: {T2, T2b, T4}

3.  **Fire T2b:**
    *   Consumes: 1 token from pa
    *   Produces: 1 token in pd
    *   **New Marking M2:** {pb = 1, pd = 1}
    *   Enabled transitions: {T4}
    *   *Note: T3 is not enabled because place pc is empty.*

4.  **Fire T4:**
    *   Consumes: 1 token from pb
    *   Produces: 1 token in pe
    *   **New Marking M3:** {pd = 1, pe = 1}
    *   Enabled transitions: {T5}
    *   *Note: T3 is still not enabled because place pc is empty.*

5.  **Fire T5:**
    *   Consumes: 1 token from pd, 1 token from pe
    *   Produces: 1 token in pf
    *   **New Marking M4:** {pf = 1}

At marking M3, just before T5 fires, T5 is enabled while T3 is not. Therefore, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.
