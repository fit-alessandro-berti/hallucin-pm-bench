| **KYC Review**        |                          | **R** (Responsible)         |                        |                     |

| **Notify Customer**   | **R** (Responsible)      |                             |                        |                     |

### Key:
- **R** = Responsible (performs the task)
- **A** = Accountable (ultimately answerable, but not used here as roles are distinct)
- **C** = Consulted (not applicable in this process)
- **I** = Informed (not applicable in this process)

All other cells are blank, as no other roles are involved in each step.
