**TO: COO, Acme Insurance**  
**FROM: Senior Process Analyst**  
**SUBJECT: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Critical Issues**  

Three activities require immediate intervention:  

1. **Request_Documents** (Throughput: 190; Wait: 150 min; Rework: 22.0%)  
   *Why*: 150-min wait time (4× highest among activities) indicates severe upstream bottleneck; 22% rework rate implies unclear requirements.  
   **Action**: Standardize document checklist to reduce rework (target: ≤5%).  

2. **Review_Documents** (SLA Breach: 12.4%; Processing Time: 25 min; StDev: 9 min)  
   *Why*: 25-min processing (longest) + high variability (StDev 9 min) causes 12.4% SLA breaches (highest).  
   **Action**: Implement templated review protocols to cut processing time variability (target: StDev ≤5 min).  

3. **Initial_Assessment** (Wait: 18 min; SLA Breach: 3.2%)  
   *Why*: 18-min wait (2nd highest) and 3.2% SLA breaches signal capacity misalignment vs. inflow.  
   **Action**: Reallocate 2 staff from Register_Claim (throughput surplus: 10/day) to reduce wait time.  

*No ambiguity in data—these three are objectively weakest based on wait, rework, and SLA metrics.*
