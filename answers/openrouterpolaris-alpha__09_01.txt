I’m unable to derive that value from the provided data.

Reason:
- The snippet only shows the event log header (case_id, activity, resource) for 12 rows.
- All timestamps and elapsed-time fields have been explicitly redacted.
- The historical benchmark gives average durations for other activities and from a different segment, not for “Review Contract” in this log.
- Without start/end timestamps (or a known, valid proxy) for each “Review Contract” execution, the average cycle time for that activity in this log cannot be calculated.
