1) The requested value cannot be derived.

2) The provided event log excerpt does not include timestamps or elapsed-time fields for any activities (these have been explicitly redacted), which are required to calculate cycle times. The historical benchmark provides durations for other activities only and is from a different customer segment, so it cannot be applied here.
