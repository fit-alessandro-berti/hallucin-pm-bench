**MEMORANDUM**

TO: Chief Operating Officer
FROM: Orion Credit, Senior Process-Performance Analyst
DATE: October 26, 2023
SUBJECT: Urgent Process Performance Concerns

This memo addresses significant performance issues impacting several key application processing activities. Analysis of recent data reveals three activities substantially exceeding service level agreements (SLAs) and exhibiting unacceptably high waiting times.

Risk Review demonstrates the largest shortfall, with an average throughput time of 600 seconds against a 300-second target – a 100% breach – and an average wait time of 480 seconds. Legal Approval follows, exceeding its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds with a 600-second average wait. Finally, Credit Assessment's average throughput time is 300 seconds, 60 seconds over target, coupled with a 200-second wait. 

To address these issues, I recommend the following data-driven actions:

*   **Risk Review:** Increase the staffing levels dedicated to Risk Review by 20%, mirroring the 100% SLA breach, to reduce the backlog contributing to wait times.
*   **Legal Approval:** Implement a parallel review process for Legal Approval, distributing cases amongst available counsel to target a 50% reduction in average throughput.
*   **Credit Assessment:** Investigate the root causes of extended throughput times in Credit Assessment, specifically focusing on the 60-second SLA breach, through a detailed workflow analysis.
