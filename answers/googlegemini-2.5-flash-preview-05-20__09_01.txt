1 ) The average cycle time of the activity "Review Contract" cannot be derived from the provided data.

2 ) The event log header does not contain any timestamp or elapsed-time fields for individual activities, only 'case_id', 'activity', and 'resource'. Without time-related data for the start and end of each activity instance, it's impossible to calculate their duration or average cycle time. The historical benchmark provides average durations for other activities but not "Review Contract," and it's explicitly stated as not drawn from this log.
