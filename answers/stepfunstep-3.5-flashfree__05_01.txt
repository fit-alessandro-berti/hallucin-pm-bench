Add an interrupting boundary timer event to the “Check Completeness” task (Task_Check) with duration PT48H. Connect its outgoing sequence flow to the “Triage Claim” task (Task_Triage). This auto-escalates the claim directly to triage if the completeness check exceeds the 48‑hour SLA deadline, while the original flow via GW_Docs handles claims that meet the deadline. The change introduces only one event and one flow, meeting the constraint of no new tasks.
