**Answer:** No

**Justification:**

1. **Rule 1** states that both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) must occur once each and in that order in every recall case. In trace 2025-05-RX17, QE does occur before RA, which satisfies the ordering part of this rule.

2. **Rule 2** stipulates that for cases where the severity level is "High," the activity `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) must occur after both QE and RA. In the trace, VP does occur after both QE and RA, thus complying with this rule.

3. **Rule 3** requires that `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must only occur after both QE and RA have been completed. However, in the trace, NA occurs after QE but before RA, which violates this rule.

4. **Rule 4** states that `Close_Case` (CC) may occur only after NA and, if required by rule 2, after VP as well. In the trace, CC does occur after both NA and VP, which complies with this rule.

Even though the trace satisfies Rules 1, 2, and 4, it fails to comply with Rule 3, which necessitates correctness in the sequence of NA following both QE and RA. Therefore, the overall trace is non-compliant with the official recall-handling ruleset R.
