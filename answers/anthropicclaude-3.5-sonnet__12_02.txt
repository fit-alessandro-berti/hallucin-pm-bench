**No**

Looking at case C003 (lines 6-7), we can see that Validate_Payment occurs at 10:43:00Z which is before Receive_Order at 10:45:00Z. Similarly, for case C005, Validate_Payment (line 11) occurs without any preceding Receive_Order activity in that case. These two examples directly contradict the claim that Validate_Payment always follows Receive_Order.
