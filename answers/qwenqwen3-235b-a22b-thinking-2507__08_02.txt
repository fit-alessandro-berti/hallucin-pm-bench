**Question 1:** Yes.  

**Question 2:** Minimal firing sequence: **T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5**.  

After T1, tokens exist in P1 and P2. Firing T2/T7/T4 consumes P1’s path to produce P5, while P2 retains its token. T5 requires P2 and P5 (both present), firing before T3—which needs only P2—is possible. T3 remains unfired here, as P2’s token is consumed by T5 directly.
