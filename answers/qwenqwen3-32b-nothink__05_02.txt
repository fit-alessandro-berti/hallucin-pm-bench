### 1. Unified Diff of the XML

```diff
-    <bpmn:userTask id="Task_CollectEquipment" name="Collect Equipment"      camunda:dueDate="P5D"/>
+    <bpmn:userTask id="Task_CollectEquipment" name="Collect Equipment"      camunda:dueDate="P3D"/>
```

### 2. One-Sentence Rationale

Reducing the due date of the **"Collect Equipment"** task from **5 days to 3 days** ensures it aligns with the overall onboarding timeline, preventing bottlenecks that cause SLA breaches.
