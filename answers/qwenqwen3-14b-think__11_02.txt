**Executive Memo: Claims Handling Process Performance (Q1-2025)**  

The three worst-performing activities are **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**, identified via poor throughput, excessive wait times, rework, and SLA breaches.  

1. **Request_Documents**  
   - **Issues**: Lowest throughput (190) and longest wait time (150 min), paired with a high rework rate (22%).  
   - **Root Cause**: Prolonged queueing and frequent rework suggest inefficient workflows or unclear documentation requirements.  
   - **Action**: Implement a standardized checklist or AI-driven document validation to reduce rework and expedite approvals.  

2. **Review_Documents**  
   - **Issues**: Highest processing time (25 min) and variability (9 min stdev), with 12.4% SLA breaches.  
   - **Root Cause**: Inconsistent processing times indicate variability in workload or skill levels.  
   - **Action**: Introduce targeted training and allocate capacity during peak hours to stabilize processing times.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - **Issues**: Second-longest wait time (18 min) and 3.2% SLA breaches despite moderate throughput (270).  
   - **Root Cause**: Delays may stem from bottlenecks in prior steps or inefficiencies in assessment protocols.  
   - **Action**: Automate initial triage rules to reduce manual intervention and accelerate case routing.  

These actions aim to address systemic inefficiencies with measurable, data-driven interventions.
