Here is a summary of every decision point and a complete list of required documents in Contoso’s flight-refund process:

**Decision Points:**

1.  **High-value claim check:** After *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* (and implicitly after *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility* and *Customer_Submit_Claim*), a decision is made based on whether the refund amount is **greater than €1,000**.
    *   **If YES (greater than €1,000):** The process moves to *Senior_Auditor_Review*.
    *   **If NO (€1,000 or less):** *Senior_Auditor_Review* is skipped, and the process proceeds to *Process_Refund_Payment*.

2.  **Eligibility Check by Triage Agent:** During *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*, the agent decides if the claim is valid based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*. If invalid, the process would presumably halt.
    *   **If Eligible:** Proceeds to *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*.
    *   **If Not Eligible:** Process likely stops.

3.  **Pre-Approval by Finance Controller:** During *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*, the finance controller decides whether to pre-approve the claim.
    *   **If Pre-Approved:** Proceeds based on the high-value decision point.
    *   **If Not Pre-Approved:** Process likely stops.

**Required Documents/Artefacts (and their relevance to activities/decsions):**

1.  **RefundRequestForm:**
    *   Submitted by the customer during *Customer_Submit_Claim*.
    *   Required for the initiation of the process and subsequent eligibility checks.

2.  **FlightManifest:**
    *   Used by the triage agent during *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*.
    *   Required to verify passenger details and flight information for eligibility.

3.  **WeatherReport:**

    *   Required to assess flight disruption causes for eligibility.

4.  **EligibilityChecklist:**

    *   Required for the finance controller to formally assess and pre-approve the claim.

5.  **AuditTrail:**
    *   Required input for the *Senior_Auditor_Review* activity.
    *   Only required if the refund amount is greater than €1,000 and *Senior_Auditor_Review* is performed.

6.  **BankTransferAuthorization:**
    *   Must be present and signed before *Process_Refund_Payment* can be executed.
    *   Required for the finance team to authorize and make the payment.
