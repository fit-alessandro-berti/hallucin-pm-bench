No, the fact is **not accurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

In **Case 1001** and **Case 1003**, the activity **"Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund"**, contradicting the claim that **"Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory"**. 

- **Case 1001**:  
  - `Update_Inventory` (08:25:55) → `Authorize_Refund` (08:30:02)

- **Case 1003**:  
  - `Update_Inventory` (10:08:07) → `Authorize_Refund` (10:22:18)

Thus, the sequence is not consistent with the claim.
