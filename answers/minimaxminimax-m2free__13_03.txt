The user asks two things:

1️⃣ How many times does the exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occur in the provided excerpt?

We need to count the lines where activity is exactly "Manual Fraud Check". The excerpt has only a few entries. Let's list them:

Rows (based on provided data):
- 1001,Create Application,complete,2025-03-01T09:02:11Z

So "Manual Fraud Check" appears once (for case 1002). Not for other cases. So answer: 1.

2️⃣ In ≤ 120 words, explain why an analyst who sees only this snippet might still misestimate how common manual fraud checks are in the full month-long log.

We need to produce a concise explanation (<120 words). The reasons could include selection bias, small sample size, limited coverage (only three cases, may not represent all cases, some cases may have manual fraud checks that are not in snippet), presence of many other activity types not present, and that manual fraud checks may be performed for some cases at later times not in snippet. Also the snippet may include events in a narrow timeframe (maybe only early March). And possibly the snippet is incomplete or may not include all cases. The snippet may show manual fraud check as only one occurrence but the log for the full month may have many more or fewer.

We also might mention that the snippet only includes certain case IDs (1001-1003) and may be non-representative; there may be other cases where manual fraud checks are performed but not captured. Also it may capture manual fraud checks only for case 1002, but there could be other patterns.

Thus answer: 1. 2. Explanation.

We need to answer succinctly, ≤120 words. Let's draft:

An analyst reviewing only the 14 lines might assume manual fraud checks occur rarely because only one instance (“Manual Fraud Check”) appears among many other activities. However, the excerpt contains only three cases over a brief period (09:02–10:45 UTC on March 1). The full month‑long log likely contains hundreds of cases, and manual checks could be more frequent in other branches or later in the month. The snippet also omits possible variants (e.g., “Manual Fraud Verification”) or repeats in the same case, introducing sampling bias. Consequently, the observed count does not reflect the true proportion for the entire dataset.

Let's count words. Let's count manually:

"An" (1) "analyst"2 "reviewing"3 "only"4 "the"5 "14"6 "lines"7 "might"8 "assume"9 "manual"10 "fraud"11 "checks"12 "occur"13 "rarely"14 "because"15 "only"16 "one"17 "instance"18 ("“Manual") (19) "Fraud"20 "Check”"21 "appears"22 "among"23 "many"24 "other"25 "activities."26 "However,"27 "the"28 "excerpt"29 "contains"30 "only"31 "three"32 "cases"33 "over"34 "a"35 "brief"36 "period"37 "(09:02–10:45"38 "UTC"39 "on"40 "March 1)."41 "The"42 "full"43 "month‑long"44 "log"45 "likely"46 "contains"47 "hundreds"48 "of"49 "cases,"50 "and"51 "manual"52 "checks"53 "could"54 "be"55 "more"56 "frequent"57 "in"58 "other"59 "branches"60 "or"61 "later"62 "in"63 "the"64 "month."65 "The"66 "snippet"67 "also"68 "omits"69 "possible"70 "variants"71 "(e.g.,"72 "“Manual"73 "Fraud"74 "Verification”)"75 "or"76 "repeats"77 "in"78 "the"79 "same"80 "case,"81 "introducing"82 "sampling"83 "bias."84 "Consequently,"85 "the"86 "observed"87 "count"88 "does"89 "not"90 "reflect"91 "the"92 "true"93 "proportion"94 "for"95 "the"96 "entire"97 "dataset."98

That's 98 words, well under 120. Good.

Now answer.
</think>

**1️⃣ Count:** “Manual Fraud Check” occurs **once** in the excerpt (case 1002 at 2025‑03‑01T09:07:13Z).

**2️⃣ Why the snippet can mislead:**  
An analyst reviewing only these 14 lines might assume manual fraud checks are rare because only one such event appears among many activities. However, the excerpt captures just three cases over a narrow window (09:02–10:45 UTC on 1 Mar). The full month‑long log likely contains hundreds of cases, and manual checks could be more common in other branches, later dates, or under different variants (e.g., “Manual Fraud Verification”). The small, non‑representative sample introduces selection bias, so the observed frequency does not reflect the true proportion across the entire dataset.
