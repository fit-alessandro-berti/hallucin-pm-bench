Attach an interrupting Timer Boundary Event (e.g., id Timer_48h, timeDuration="PT48H") to “Request Missing Docs” (Task_RequestDocs) and connect its outgoing sequence flow directly to “Triage Claim” (Task_Triage). If the claim is still waiting for documents when 48 hours have elapsed since submission, the timer fires, cancels Task_RequestDocs, and pushes the token into Task_Triage. This automatic shortcut ensures every claim reaches triage within the SLA without introducing any new tasks.
