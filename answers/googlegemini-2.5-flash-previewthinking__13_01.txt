Here are the answers based on the provided log fragment:

1.  The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs exactly **1** time.
2.  This represents (1 / 18) * 100 = **5.56**% of all logged events.
3.  The case identifier containing “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.
4.  Two sampling-related reasons why estimating monthly frequency from this fragment is unreliable are:
    *   **Limited Time Duration:** The fragment covers only a single day (May 1st, 2025), which is not representative of a full month. Manual fraud checks may occur with different frequencies on different days of the week, times of the month, or due to seasonal factors.
    *   **Small Sample Size (Cases/Events):** The fragment contains only a small number of cases (4) and events (18). The observed frequency in such a small sample might not accurately reflect the true frequency across a larger population of cases processed over an entire month.
