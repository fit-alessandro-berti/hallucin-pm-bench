Add a timer boundary event to `Task_Check` to escalate if it takes too long. Attach a non-interrupting timer event with a 48-hour duration. This event's flow should connect directly to `Task_Triage`, bypassing `GW_Docs` and `Task_RequestDocs`. This ensures the claim is triaged within the SLA, even if the completeness check is incomplete. The original path for complete/missing docs continues to operate in parallel, but the triage deadline is guaranteed.

**Element IDs:** Add `<bpmn:boundaryEvent id="Timer_48hr" attachedToRef="Task_Check" cancelActivity="false">` with a timer definition and a sequence flow to `Task_Triage`.
