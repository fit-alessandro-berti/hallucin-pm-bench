1. The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurs exactly **1** time.  
2. Manual_Fraud_Check makes up 1⁄18 ≈ 5.56% of all logged activities (rounded to two decimal places).  
3. The case identifier containing “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.  
4. Two sampling-related issues that make the monthly estimate unreliable are:  
   a) **Timeframe limitation**: The fragment only covers a single day, so extrapolating to a full month would assume no variation in activity frequency.  
   b) **Risk of selection bias**: There is no way to know whether this one-day fragment is representative of typical weeks/months (e.g., the day might have had abnormally low/high fraud check activity).
