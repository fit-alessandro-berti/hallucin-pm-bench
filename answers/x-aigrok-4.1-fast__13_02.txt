### 3. Why low-support activities mislead analyses
With only 1 occurrence (2.08% events, 8.33% cases), "Manual_Fraud_Check" has insufficient support for reliable generalization. Performance metrics (e.g., duration, outcomes) from this single instance may be outliers, skewing averages. Predictive models risk overfitting to noise, producing unreliable forecasts. In process mining, rare activities amplify sampling bias in this small excerpt, leading to distorted conformance checks or bottleneck detection. (58 words)
