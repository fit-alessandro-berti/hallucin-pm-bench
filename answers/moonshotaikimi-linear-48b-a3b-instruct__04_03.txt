The trace is **not compliant**.

**Justification**

Rule 1: both "Quality_Engineer_Review" and "Regulatory_Affairs_Review" appear **once**, and the QE step is **before** the RA step — the order is correct. ✓

Rule 2: `VP_Safety_Approval` appears **before** both QE and RA, violating the rule that VP must happen **after both**. ✗

Rule 3: `Notify_Authorities` appears **before** RA completes — again, violates the rule that NA must wait until **after both** QE and RA. ✗

Rule 4: `Close_Case` appears **before** NA, violating the rule that CC may occur only **after** NA. ✗

Therefore, the trace violates multiple rules and is **non-compliant**.
