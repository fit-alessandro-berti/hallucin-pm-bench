To create the RACI table as per the given task, we first need to adjust the given informal process description to adhere to the mandated vocabulary. The adjusted description is as follows:

1. A **Transaction Analyst** receives the customerâ€™s transfer instruction and logs it in the system.  
2. The **Transaction Analyst** screens the payment against the sanctions list.  
3. A **Regulatory Liaison** performs the **KYC Review** check on both sender and beneficiary.  
4. If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, the **Regulatory Liaison** must approve it.  
5. Once approved, the **Transaction Analyst** releases the payment; IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent.  
6. Finally, IT Support archives the case file; the **Regulatory Liaison** is notified.

Now, let's create the RACI table in Markdown format based on the adjusted description:

| Task Description | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Receive and log customer's transfer instruction | R | - | - |
| Screen payment against sanctions list | R | - | - |
| Perform **KYC Review** on sender and beneficiary | - | R | - |
| Approve high-risk transaction | - | R | - |
| Release payment | R | - | - |
| Ensure SWIFT message is sent | - | - | R |
| Archive case file | - | - | R |
| Notify **Regulatory Liaison** of archived case file | - | I | R |

Here's a key to the RACI table:
- **R**: Responsible - The person or team responsible for completing the task.
- **A**: Accountable - The person or team accountable for the outcome of the task. (Not directly applicable in this simplified table as we don't have a clear "Accountable" role mentioned for each task, but typically, one of the roles could be accountable for the overall process.)
- **C**: Consulted - The person or team consulted during the task. (Not used in this table as per the given tasks.)
- **I**: Informed - The person or team informed after the task is completed.

To fully adhere to the RACI matrix structure, we should note that typically, one role is "Accountable" for each task. However, the provided task and description do not explicitly allow for identifying an "Accountable" role distinct from "Responsible" without making assumptions. Therefore, the table focuses on "Responsible" and "Informed" based on the information given.

To make it a complete RACI, we could consider the following adjustments for "Accountable":

| Task Description | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Receive and log customer's transfer instruction | R, A | - | - |
| Screen payment against sanctions list | R, A | - | - |
| Perform **KYC Review** on sender and beneficiary | - | R, A | - |
| Approve high-risk transaction | - | R, A | - |
| Release payment | R | A | - |
| Ensure SWIFT message is sent | - | - | R, A |
| Archive case file | - | - | R, A |
| Notify **Regulatory Liaison** of archived case file | - | I | R, A |

In this adjusted version, I've assumed the "Accountable" role for each task based on the context, making the role responsible for the task's outcome also accountable where it makes sense.
