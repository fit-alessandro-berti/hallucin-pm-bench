The requested value cannot be derived.

Explanation: The event log provided contains only case_id, activity, and resource fields. It does **not** include timestamps or elapsed-time data (as explicitly stated in the header: “timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted”). Since cycle time for an activity requires timing information (e.g., start and end times or duration), the average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be calculated from the available data.
