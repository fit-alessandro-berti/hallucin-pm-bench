**• Added tasks**  
- **Verify Identity** (id: `Task_VerifyIdentity`) – inserted between Start and Review Application.  
- **Request Additional Documents** (id: `Task_RequestDocs`) – new branch from the decision gateway for “missing docs”.  
- **Final Reject** (id: `Task_FinalReject`) – replaces the former reject task for the “ineligible” branch.  

**• Removed tasks**  
- **Reject Loan** (id: `Task_RejectLoan`) – deleted; superseded by Final Reject.  

**• Gateway-type changes (e.g., Exclusive → Inclusive)**  
- **Gateway_Decision** changed from `exclusiveGateway` (v1) to `inclusiveGateway` (v2), enabling multiple outgoing sequence flows (eligible, missing docs, ineligible) to be triggered simultaneously if conditions allow.
