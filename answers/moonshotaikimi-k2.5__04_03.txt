 **No**

**Justification:**
- **Rule 1 (QE before RA):** Satisfied – `Quality_Engineer_Review` (position 3) precedes `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (position 5).  
- **Rule 2 (VP after QE & RA for High severity):** Satisfied – `VP_Safety_Approval` (position 6) occurs after both QE and RA are complete.  
- **Rule 3 (NA after QE and RA):** **Violated** – `Notify_Authorities` (position 4) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (position 5); NA must wait until both reviews are finished.  
- **Rule 4 (CC after NA and VP):** Satisfied – `Close_Case` (position 7) follows both NA (position 4) and VP (position 6).  

Because Rule 3 is breached, the trace is non-compliant.
