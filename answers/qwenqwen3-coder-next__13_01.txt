1. **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
→ **1** time.

2. **What percentage of all logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
→ Total events = 18.  
Manual_Fraud_Check occurrences = 1.  
Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ **5.56%**.

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  
→ **A1002**

4. **Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate is unreliable:**  
- **Temporal bias / non-representative time window**: The fragment covers only one day (2025-05-01); fraud detection frequency may vary significantly by day of week, time of year, promotions, or system changes, so a single-day sample is unlikely to represent monthly patterns.  
- **Small sample size / low event frequency**: With only 1 observed instance in 18 events, the estimate is highly unstable—proportion estimates based on rare events require large samples for reliability, and this fragment does not provide sufficient statistical power (risk of high variance, confidence intervals would be very wide).
