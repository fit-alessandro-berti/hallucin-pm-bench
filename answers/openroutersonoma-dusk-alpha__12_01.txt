No, the fact is not accurate with respect to the event-log fragment.

**Justification:** The claim states that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" within the same case. However, case 1001 shows "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurring before "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02), which violates the claimed order. Case 1003 also shows "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) before "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18). Case 1002 lacks "Update_Inventory" entirely, providing no counterexample but also no support for the claim across all cases.
