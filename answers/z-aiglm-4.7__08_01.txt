**Yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

Here is the concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:

**Sequence:** $T_1 \rightarrow T_2 \rightarrow T_5$

**Justification and Trace:**

1.  **Initial Marking:** $M_0 = \{p_0\}$ (1 token in $p_0$).
2.  **Fire $T_1$:**
    *   $T_1$ consumes the token from $p_0$ and produces tokens in $p_1$ and $p_2$.
    *   **Marking:** $\{p_1, p_2\}$.
3.  **Fire $T_2$:**
    *   $T_2$ consumes the token from $p_1$ and produces a token in $p_3$.
    *   **Marking:** $\{p_2, p_3\}$.
    *   *Note:* $T_3$ is currently enabled (because $p_2$ has a token), but we choose not to fire it yet.
4.  **Fire $T_5$:**
    *   We check the enabling conditions for $T_5$:
        *   **Normal arc:** Requires a token in $p_3$. (Available in current marking).
        *   **Inhibitor arc:** Requires **zero** tokens in $p_4$. (Available in current marking, because $T_3$ has not fired).
    *   $T_5$ fires, consuming the token from $p_3$ and producing a token in $p_6$.
    *   **Marking:** $\{p_2, p_6\}$.

In this sequence, $T_5$ fires at step 4. Transition $T_3$ has not fired (and the token remains in $p_2$). Therefore, $T_5$ fires before $T_3$.
