**Question 1.** In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition **T5** to fire **before** transition **T3**?

Yes.

**Question 2 (bonus).** If your answer is *yes*, give one minimal firing sequence (as an ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it; if *no*, explain why no such sequence exists.

To enable T5, tokens are required in P2 and P5. T1 provides a token to P2. To get a token in P5 without T3 firing, the path T2 → T7 → T4 must be followed. This sequence (T1, T2, T7, T4) places tokens in P2 and P5, enabling T5. At this point, T3 has not fired, as the P4 token required for P5 was obtained via T7, not T3. When T5 fires, it consumes the token from P2, thereby preventing T3 from ever firing.

Minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5
