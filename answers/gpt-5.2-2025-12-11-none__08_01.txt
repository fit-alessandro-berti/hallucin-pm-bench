No — it’s impossible.

**Proof (by necessary enabling conditions):**

- The only way to put a token in **p3** (which T5 needs on its normal input arc) is to fire **T2**, and **T2** requires a token in **p1**.
- The only way to create tokens in **p1** and **p2** is **T1**, and when **T1** fires it produces **p1=1** *and* **p2=1** simultaneously (parallel split).
- From that point on, the only way to remove the token from **p2** is to fire **T3** (since the only outgoing transition from p2 is T3), and firing T3 necessarily produces a token in **p4**.

Now consider any marking where **T5** could fire:
- T5 requires **p3=1** (so T2 must have fired, hence T1 must have fired).
- T5 also requires **p4=0** (inhibitor condition).

But after T1 has fired, we have **p2=1**, and the only way to ever get rid of that token is **T3**, which *creates* **p4=1**. There is no transition in the net that consumes a token from **p4** except **T4**, and **T4** requires **p4=1** (so if T3 fires, p4 becomes nonzero and stays nonzero unless T4 fires).

Therefore:
- **Before T3 fires**, we still have **p2=1**, but that doesn’t help; to enable T5 we need **p3=1**, which requires T2, which is possible.
- However, **the inhibitor condition p4=0 is compatible with “before T3”**, but the critical issue is reachability of p3 while keeping p4=0 isn’t blocked.
- The real blocker is that after T1, T2 can fire giving p3=1 while p4=0, so at first glance T5 *could* fire.

Yet **T5 also consumes the token from p3**, producing p6, leaving the token in p2 untouched. That is allowed. So the above would suggest “yes”.

Let’s check concretely: from M0: p0=1.
1) Fire **T1**: p1=1, p2=1.
2) Fire **T2**: p3=1, p2=1, p4=0.
At this marking, **T5 is enabled** (p3=1 and p4=0), so it **can** fire *before* T3.

So the correct answer is **Yes**.

**Concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:**
\[
T1,\; T2,\; T5
\]

**Justification:**
After **T1** and **T2**, we have a token in **p3** and still **no token in p4** because **T3** hasn’t fired yet. The inhibitor arc from **p4** therefore allows **T5** to be enabled, and **T5** can fire before **T3**.
