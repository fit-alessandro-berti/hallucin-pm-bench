Here are the decision points and the documents required for the refund process:

**Decision points**
- **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**: Determines eligibility by checking the claim against the *FlightManifest* and the *WeatherReport*.
- **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**: Signs off on the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*.
- **High-value branch**: If the refund amount is greater than €1 000, the case must go to **Senior_Auditor_Review**, which must include the *AuditTrail*.
- **Process_Refund_Payment** gate: Payment can proceed only after **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** is completed and, for high-value claims, **Senior_Auditor_Review** is also completed. Payment execution requires a signed *BankTransferAuthorization*.
