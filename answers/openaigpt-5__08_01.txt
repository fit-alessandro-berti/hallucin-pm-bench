Yes.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:
T1, T2, T5, T3

Justification:
- After T1: p1=1, p2=1.
- After T2: p3=1, p4=0. Therefore T5 is enabled (needs p3=1 and inhibits on p4=0).
- Fire T5: consumes p3 and produces p6, still p4=0.
- Only afterwards fire T3 to produce p4=1.

Thus T5 fires before T3 in this reachable run.
