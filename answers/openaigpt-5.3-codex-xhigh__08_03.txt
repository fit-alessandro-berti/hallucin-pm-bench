Yes.

A **shortest** firing sequence is:
\[
\boxed{T1,\;T2b,\;T4,\;T5}
\]
(\(T4\) and \(T2b\) can be swapped.)

Marking trace (places \(p0,pa,pb,pc,pd,pe,pf\)):

- \(M_0=(1,0,0,0,0,0,0)\)
- after \(T1\): \(M_1=(0,1,1,0,0,0,0)\)
- after \(T2b\): \(M_2=(0,0,1,0,1,0,0)\)
- after \(T4\): \(M_3=(0,0,0,0,1,1,0)\)  ⟹ \(T5\) enabled
- after \(T5\): \(M_4=(0,0,0,0,0,0,1)\)

So \(T5\) fires with **no prior \(T3\)** (indeed \(T3\) never fired in this run).  
This is shortest because before \(T5\), you must create both \(pd\) and \(pe\): that requires \(T1\) plus one producer for \(pd\) (\(T2b\)) and one for \(pe\) (\(T4\)).
