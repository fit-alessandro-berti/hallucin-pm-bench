**MEMORANDUM**  
**TO:** COO, Orion Credit  
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**SUBJECT:** Urgent Performance Issues in Loan Origination Process  

Analysis of Q3 data reveals three critical activities severely breaching SLAs with excessive waiting times.  

**Risk Review** is the worst performer, with an average throughput of 600 seconds, double its 300-second SLA. The waiting time of 480 seconds constitutes 80% of this delay, indicating a severe bottleneck.  

**Legal Approval** averages 900 seconds against a 600-second SLA, a 50% breach. A staggering 600 seconds (67% of total time) is spent waiting, signifying major resource constraints.  

**Credit Assessment** exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds (25% breach), with 200 seconds (67% of total time) spent waiting.  

Immediate actions are required to address these delays:  
*   For Risk Review, **re-allocate underwriting resources to this bottleneck stage to reduce the queue and cut waiting time.**
*   For Legal Approval, **implement a triage system to prioritize standard agreements and reduce the input queue for legal staff.**
*   For Credit Assessment, **revise work allocation rules to prevent case pile-up and improve scheduler efficiency for assessors.**
