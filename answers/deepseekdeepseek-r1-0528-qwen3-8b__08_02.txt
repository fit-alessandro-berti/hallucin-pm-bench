**Answer to Question 1:**  
Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in some reachable marking. This is because T5 can be enabled and fired using the T2-T7-T4 path, which produces P5 without firing T3, allowing T5 to occur earlier or simultaneously without T3 being necessary. T3 may remain unexecuted if its conditions are not met or not prioritized.

**Answer to Question 2 (bonus):**  
A minimal firing sequence demonstrating this is: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.  
- T1 consumes P0, producing P1 and P2.  
- T2 consumes P1, producing P3, enabling T7.  
- T7 consumes P3, producing P4, enabling T4.  
- T4 consumes P4, producing P5.  
- T5 consumes P2 and P5, producing P6.  
In this sequence, T5 fires after T2, T7, and T4, but before any firing of T3, demonstrating that T5 can precede T3. This sequence is minimal as it includes only necessary transitions to enable the condition. The marking state after T5 ensures T3 cannot fire due to no remaining P2 tokens.
