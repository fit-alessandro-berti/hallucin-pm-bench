Yes, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3** in a reachable marking.  

**Shortest firing sequence**:  
`T1 → T2b → T4 → T5`  

### Explanation:  
1. **Initial marking**: `p0 = 1`, all other places = 0.  
2. **T1** fires: Consumes `p0`, produces `pa` and `pb`. Now: `pa = 1`, `pb = 1`.  
3. **T2b** fires: Consumes `pa`, produces `pd`. Now: `pa = 0`, `pd = 1`.  
4. **T4** fires: Consumes `pb`, produces `pe`. Now: `pb = 0`, `pe = 1`.  
5. **T5** fires: Consumes `pd` and `pe`, produces `pf`. Now: `pd = 0`, `pe = 0`, `pf = 1`.  

At this point, **T3** (which requires `pc`) has **not** fired, as `pc` was never populated (T2 was not fired). Thus, **T5** fires before **T3**.  

This sequence is minimal (4 transitions) and satisfies the condition.
