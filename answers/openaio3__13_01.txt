1. Number of “Manual_Fraud_Check” occurrences: **1**

2. Percentage of all logged events:  
   (1 ÷ 18) × 100 = **5.56 %**

3. Case identifier(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”: **A1002**

4. Why a monthly estimate based only on this fragment is unreliable (sampling issues):  
   • The fragment covers only a single 5-hour window on 1 May 2025, so it is not temporally representative of an entire month (time-coverage bias).  
   • The sample size is extremely small (18 events, 4 cases, with just one fraud check), making any extrapolation highly sensitive to random variation (high sampling variance).
