**Subject:** Claims Handling Process â€“ Performance Analysis and Recommendations  

Based on Q1-2025 data, the three worst-performing activities in the Claims Handling process are:  

1. **Request_Documents**  
   - Underperformance drivers: Exceptionally high average wait time (150 min) and a very high rework rate (22%). Additionally, it has a notable SLA breach rate (5.5%).  
   - Recommendation: Investigate and streamline document request communication and follow-ups to reduce queue delays and rework, potentially through automation or improved customer portals.  

2. **Review_Documents**  
   - Underperformance drivers: Long average processing time (25 min), high standard deviation (9 min) indicating inconsistent durations, a significant rework rate (5.3%), and the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%).  
   - Recommendation: Standardize review procedures and enhance training or introduce decision support tools to reduce variability and reworks, improving throughput and SLA adherence.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**  
   - Underperformance drivers: High average wait time (18 min) and highest SLA breach percentage among early steps (3.2%), coupled with moderate processing time (12 min) and elevated rework rate (1.8%).  
   - Recommendation: Optimize workload balancing or resource allocation to reduce queues and rework, focusing on front-loading capacity in this critical early step.  

Other activities exhibit more balanced metrics with lower wait times, rework rates, and SLA breaches, so these three represent clear priorities for improvement.
