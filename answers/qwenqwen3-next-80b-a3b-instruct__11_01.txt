**Executive Memo: Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks**

Per data from last 12 months, the three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:  
#1. **Request_Documents**: Avg 36.5h (95p: 120.0h) — *Action: Automate document request triggers via real-time claim submission alerts to third-party portals.*  
#2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: Avg 12.2h (95p: 44.0h) — *Action: Deploy templated, auto-sent closure letters upon claim rejection or settlement approval, bypassing manual queues.*  
#3. **Assess_Liability**: Avg 7.8h (95p: 16.4h) — *Action: Implement AI-assisted liability scoring engine using historical claim patterns to reduce manual review time by 30%.*

Each action targets root causes of delay and is projected to cut waiting time by ≥20% across 255–275 executions. No other activities exceed 5h avg. waiting time.
