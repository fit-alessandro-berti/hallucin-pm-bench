I cannot compute the average cycle time of the “Approve Invoice” activity—or its standard deviation and 95 % confidence interval—because the only artifact provided from the event log is a header stub; all rows and timestamp values have been redacted. Without any actual case records showing the start_time and complete_time for “Approve Invoice,” there is no data from which to derive durations, aggregates, or statistical measures. Consequently, none of the requested metrics can be calculated from the information available.
