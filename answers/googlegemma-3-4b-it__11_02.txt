**MEMORANDUM**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance â€“ Actionable Insights

This memo highlights key areas for improvement within the Claims Handling process based on Q1-2025 performance data.

Three activities require immediate attention: **Request_Documents** (avg_throughput: 190, rework_rate_pct: 22.0, sla_breach_pct: 5.5), **Review_Documents** (avg_throughput: 185, rework_rate_pct: 5.3, sla_breach_pct: 12.4), and **Initial_Assessment** (avg_throughput: 270, sla_breach_pct: 3.2).  Request Documents exhibits the highest rework rate and SLA breaches, likely due to insufficient documentation clarity. Review Documents faces high processing time combined with a significant SLA breach rate, suggesting potential bottlenecks in document review workflows. Initial Assessment, while maintaining throughput, has a considerable SLA breach percentage demonstrating timeliness challenges.

Recommendations: 1) For Request Documents, implement a standardized document checklist. 2) For Review Documents, investigate workflow bottlenecks and consider additional training for reviewers. 3) For Initial Assessment, explore process automation to reduce manual review time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
Senior Process-Performance Analyst
