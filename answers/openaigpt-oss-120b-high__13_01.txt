**1.** The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1** time in this fragment.  

**2.** Percentage of all logged events:  

\[
\frac{1}{18}\times 100 = 5.555\ldots\% \;\approx\; \mathbf{5.56\%}
\]

**3.** The case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”:  

- **A1002**

**4.** Two sampling‑related reasons why estimating the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks from this fragment is unreliable:

1. **Extremely small sample size** – The fragment contains only 18 events (one day’s worth of activity). With such a tiny number of observations, random fluctuations dominate, so the observed count (1) is unlikely to reflect the true average rate over a whole month.

2. **Limited temporal coverage (single‑day snapshot)** – All events are logged on 2025‑05‑01. Fraud‑check occurrences may vary across days, weeks, or seasons (e.g., higher on weekends, during promotions, etc.). Using a single‑day snapshot disregards these temporal patterns, leading to a biased and non‑representative estimate for the entire month.
