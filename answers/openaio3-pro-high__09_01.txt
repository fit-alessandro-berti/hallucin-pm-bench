1) The average cycle time of “Review Contract” cannot be calculated from the information provided.

2) To compute a cycle-time average we would need either (a) start- and end-timestamps for each “Review Contract” event or (b) pre-calculated duration values. The excerpt of the event log contains only case-id, activity name and resource; all time fields are explicitly redacted, and no duration column is present. Without those data the average duration cannot be derived.
