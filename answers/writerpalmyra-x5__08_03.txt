Yes, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

This can occur if the shortcut transition **T2b** fires instead of **T2**, allowing **pd** to be marked without waiting for **T3** to fire (i.e., without passing through **pc**).

Here is a **shortest** firing sequence in which **T5** fires before **T3**:

**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

### Marking trace:
- Initial: `p0=1`
- After **T1**: `pa=1, pb=1`
- After **T2b**: `pb=1, pd=1`
- After **T4**: `pe=1, pd=1`
- After **T5**: `pf=1` → now **T5** has fired, and **T3** has not.

At this point, **T3** has not fired yet (and **pc** remains unmarked), so the condition is satisfied.

Thus, **T5 before T3** is indeed possible.
