Upon reviewing the provided artefacts, it is clear that none of the metrics can be computed exactly. Artefact A – the event log – contains no actual event data (only column headers), and Artefact B does not include any data related to the timestamps of the “Approve Invoice” activity. Therefore, with no case-specific duration data, cycle times, standard deviation, or confidence intervals can be calculated. Any attempt at approximation would be pure speculation rather than analysis based on the provided information.
