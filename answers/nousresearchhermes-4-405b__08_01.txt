In the given safe Petri net, T5 fires only if p3 has a token and p4 has *zero* tokens. For T5 to fire before T3, T5 must occur after T2 (which puts a token in p3) but before T3 (which removes the token from p2). We now show this is impossible.

1. Initially, only p0 is marked.  
2. The first transition to fire must be **T1**, which moves the token from p0 to both p1 and p2. This leaves exactly one token in both p1 and p2.  
3. At this point:  
   - **T2** is enabled (needs p1’s token).  
   - **T3** is enabled (needs p2’s token).  
4. T5 is **not enabled** because p4 has no token yet, and T5 requires a token in p3 but also *zero* tokens in p4.  

From Step 3 onward:  

- If **T3 fires** next (removing p2’s token and placing a token in p4), then p4 becomes marked. With p4 marked, **T5 can never fire** because T5’s inhibitor arc from p4 actively blocks it.  
- The only way for T5 to fire is if p3 has a token (from T2 firing) *and* p4 remains empty. However, p2 still holds the token it received from T1. Because p2 has a token, **T3 remains fireable**. In any subsequent step where T3 fires (to produce a token in p4), it will disable T5.  

Thus, T5 cannot fire before T3 fires.  

**Conclusion:**  
A concrete firing sequence from the initial marking where T5 fires before T3 is impossible because T5’s firing condition (token in p3 combined with zero tokens in p4) cannot be met if p2’s token (which enables T3) still exists. Once T3 fires, p4 becomes marked, permanently disabling T5 via its inhibitor arc.  

Answer: **No, T5 cannot fire before T3.**
