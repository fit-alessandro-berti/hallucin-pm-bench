Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

One shortest firing sequence that achieves this is: **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

Explanation of the sequence (step by step):

- Initial marking: p0 = 1
- Fire **T1**: consumes the token from p0, produces one token in pa and one token in pb  
  → marking: pa = 1, pb = 1
- Fire **T2b** (the shortcut): consumes the token from pa, produces one token in pd  
  → marking: pb = 1, pd = 1
- Fire **T4**: consumes the token from pb, produces one token in pe  
  → marking: pd = 1, pe = 1
- Fire **T5**: consumes the tokens from pd and pe, produces one token in pf  
  → marking: pf = 1

At this point T5 has fired, while **T3 has never fired** (pc has always remained empty, so T3 was never enabled). The reachable marking with pf = 1 proves that T5 can indeed become enabled and fire without T3 ever having fired, i.e., T5 can fire before T3 in the execution history.

Thus the ordering T5 before T3 is possible, and the sequence above is one of the shortest (length 4) that demonstrates it.
