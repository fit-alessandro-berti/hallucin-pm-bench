Non-compliant

**Justification:**

1.  **Rule 2 violation:** The trace contains `Expedite_Flag`. According to Rule 2, if `Expedite_Flag` is present, `Risk_Assessment` *must occur before* the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. In Trace 24-EXP, `Ship_Goods` occurs at step 8 and `Risk_Assessment` occurs at step 9. This violates the temporal constraint.

**Compliant aspects (for completeness, not required for the answer):**

*   **Rule 1:** `PO_Amount` is €12 300 (exceeds €10 000). `Approve_PO` by `Procurement_Officer` (step 2) and `Approve_PO_CFO` by `CFO` (step 3) both occurred before `Issue_PO` (step 5). This rule is satisfied.
*   **Rule 2 (Quality_Check):** `Quality_Check` is optional due to `Expedite_Flag`. Its absence is permissible.
*   **Rule 3:** `Goods_Received` is at step 6. `Three_way_match` is at step 10. The activities between them are `Move_to_Quality` (step 7) and `Ship_Goods` (step 8). This means `Three_way_match` occurred 4 activities after `Goods_Received` (distance = 4), not within the next two (distance <= 2). This also implies a non-compliance to Rule 3.
*   **Rule 4:** `CFO` (step 3) is followed by `System` (step 4). `Intern` (step 7) is not directly preceded by `CFO`. This rule is satisfied.
*   **Rule 5:** The trace finishes with `Archive_Record` (step 11) and contains nothing after it. This rule is satisfied.
