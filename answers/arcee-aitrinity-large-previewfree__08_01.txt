No, it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3.

Proof:
1. The initial marking is (1,0,0,0,0,0,0).
2. The only transition enabled initially is T1.
3. After firing T1, the marking is (0,1,1,0,0,0,0).
4. Now T2 and T3 are enabled (both have all input places marked).
5. T5 has an inhibitor arc from p4, so it is enabled only if p4 is empty. At this point p4 = 0, so T5 is enabled.
6. However, firing T5 requires a token in p3 (which is true), but it will **remove** that token from p3 and put one in p6.
7. If T5 fires first, p3 becomes 0, and p4 is still 0. Then T3 cannot fire because p2 is still marked, but it needs p2 to be empty (it consumes from p2). Actually, T3 is still enabled since p2 has a token. Wait, correction: T3 consumes from p2, so it is enabled. But if T5 fires before T3, p3 is emptied, so when T3 later fires, p3 remains 0, so T4 cannot fire (it needs both p3 and p4). This leaves the net in a deadlock state where p0, p1, p2 are empty, p3=0, p4=1, p5=0, p6=1. This is not a valid end state.
8. In any valid run that reaches the final marking (0,0,0,0,0,1,0), both T2 and T3 must have fired before T4, and T5 cannot be part of a correct completion.
9. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any correct run.

So the answer is: **No**, it is not possible for T5 to fire before T3.
