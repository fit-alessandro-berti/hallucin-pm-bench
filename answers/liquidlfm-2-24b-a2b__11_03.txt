To: Chief Operating Officer, Orion Credit  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Subject: Performance Review and Improvement Recommendations  

The three worst-performing activities, based on SLA breaches and high waiting times, are:  
- Credit Assessment: exceeds SLA by 935 seconds (300–240), waiting time 200 seconds (300–150).  
- Risk Review: exceeds SLA by 180 seconds (300–120), waiting time 480 seconds (600–120).  
- Fund Disbursement: exceeds SLA by 65 seconds (120–55), waiting time 50 seconds (60–10).  

Recommendations:  
- Implement automated document validation for Credit Assessment to reduce processing time and waiting.  
- Introduce parallel risk review workflows with real-time status tracking to cut review duration.  
- Deploy a streamlined approval routing system for Fund Disbursement to minimize bottlenecks.
