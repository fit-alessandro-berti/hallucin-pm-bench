The requested metrics cannot be computed because **Artefact A contains no actual event data** – all rows and timestamp values are redacted, leaving only column headers. Without the start_time and complete_time for each occurrence of the “Approve Invoice” activity, it is impossible to calculate individual cycle times, and consequently the average, standard deviation, and 95 % confidence interval cannot be derived. The SLA data in Artefact B merely provides a historical average for the interval *between* “Approve Invoice” and “Pay Invoice,” which is a different measure and does not supply the underlying activity‑level timestamps required for the calculation.
