1) The average cycle time for the activity "Review Contract" **cannot be derived** from the provided data.  

### Explanation:  
- The event log **lacks timestamp or duration data** for activities (explicitly stated: *"timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted"*).  
- Cycle time calculation requires either:  
  - Start/end timestamps to compute activity duration per instance, or  
  - Pre-calculated duration values per activity.  
- The log only includes `case_id`, `activity`, and `resource` fields, making time-based metrics impossible to determine.  
- The historical benchmark is irrelevant as it:  
  - Refers to a different customer segment,  
  - Does not include "Review Contract" metrics,  
  - Is explicitly **not** sourced from this log.  

**Conclusion**: Without temporal data, no cycle time can be calculated for any activity in this log.
