Answer 1: No.

Answer 2: After T1, tokens are in P1 and P2. To enable T5, we need tokens in both P2 and P5. The only way to produce a token in P5 is via T4, which requires a token in P4. P4 can be marked either by T3 (from P2) or by T7 after T2 (from P1→P3→P4). If we avoid T3, we can still reach P5 via T2→T7→T4, but T5 then requires the token in P2 as well. Thus T5 can only fire when both P2 and P5 are marked; firing T5 consumes P2, making T3 impossible afterward, not before. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any run.
