**Executive Memo to the COO**

Subject: Performance Analysis of Q1-2025 Claims Handling Process

After reviewing the Q1-2025 performance dashboard for the *Claims Handling* process, the three worst-performing activities are identified as follows:

1. **Request Documents**: 
   - **Why Under-Performs**: This activity has the highest average wait time at 150 minutes and the highest rework rate at 22.0%.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement an automated document request system to reduce wait times and prevent repetitive manual entries, thereby decreasing rework.

2. **Review Documents**: 
   - **Why Under-Performs**: It shows the second-highest average processing time at 25 minutes with a high standard deviation of 9, along with a significant rework rate of 5.3% and SLA breach rate of 12.4%.
   - **Recommendation**: Introduce a document review checklist and training program to standardize processes, reducing variability and improving efficiency.

3. **Calculate Payout**: 
   - **Why Under-Performs**: With an SLA breach rate of 1.2% and rework rate of 0.8%, this activity suffers from post-processing inefficiencies.
   - **Recommendation**: Deploy advanced analytics tools to assist in calculation accuracy and streamline payout processes.

These targeted actions are expected to enhance overall process efficiency and meet SLA commitments.
