Add an interrupting timer boundary event to Task_Receive to escalate if “Triage Claim” isn’t reached in time.

Change:
- Attach a boundary timer event (e.g., Boundary_Timer_48h) to Task_Receive with timeDuration PT48H.
- On timeout, route directly to Task_Triage via a new sequenceFlow (e.g., f2_timeout) bypassing Task_Check/GW_Docs/Task_RequestDocs.
- Keep normal path f2→Task_Check→GW_Docs when completed within 48h.

This guarantees every claim reaches Task_Triage within 48 hours while preserving existing tasks. You may also mark the boundary event as interrupting so the receiving work doesn’t continue after timeout.
