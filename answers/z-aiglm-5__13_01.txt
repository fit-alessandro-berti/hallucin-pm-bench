Here are the answers based on the provided event-log fragment:

1.  **1**
    (The activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” appears explicitly only once, in line 7.)

2.  **5.56%**
    (There is 1 occurrence of “Manual_Fraud_Check” out of 18 total events. Calculation: $(1 \div 18) \times 100 = 5.555...$, which rounds to 5.56%.)

3.  **A1002**
    (This is the only case containing the “Manual_Fraud_Check” activity.)

4.  **Two sampling-related reasons for unreliability:**
    *   **Insufficient Sample Size:** The fragment contains only 18 events covering a single day (May 1st). Extrapolating a monthly frequency from such a small dataset ignores daily variations and results in a statistically insignificant estimate.
    *   **Timeframe Bias (Lack of Representativeness):** The data represents a "snapshot" of a specific few hours. It does not capture potential seasonal patterns, week-versus-weekend differences, or end-of-month behaviors that would occur within a full monthly cycle.
