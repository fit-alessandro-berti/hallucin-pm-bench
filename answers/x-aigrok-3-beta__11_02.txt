**Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Review**  
To: COO, Acme Insurance  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Date: [Insert Date]  

**Subject:** Key Underperforming Activities and Recommendations  

Our Q1-2025 performance dashboard for Claims Handling highlights three underperforming activities: Request Documents, Review Documents, and Initial Assessment.  

1. **Request Documents**: This activity shows the lowest throughput (190 cases/day), a significantly high wait time (150 minutes), and the highest rework rate (22.0%). **Action**: Implement automated document request reminders to reduce wait times and rework.  
2. **Review Documents**: With a throughput of 185 cases/day, the highest processing time (25 minutes), high variability (stdev 9 minutes), and an SLA breach rate of 12.4%, efficiency is compromised. **Action**: Introduce AI-assisted document analysis to standardize and accelerate processing.  
3. **Initial Assessment**: Despite a decent throughput (270 cases/day), it has a high wait time (18 minutes) and an SLA breach rate of 3.2%, indicating bottlenecks. **Action**: Allocate additional staff during peak hours to reduce wait times.  

These targeted actions aim to address specific inefficiencies. I welcome further discussion on resource allocation or technology investments to support these improvements.  

Sincerely,
