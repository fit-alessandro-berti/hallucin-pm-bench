No. In case C003, the activity “Validate_Payment” occurs on line 6 before “Receive_Order” on line 7, so it does not follow it, and in case C005 there is a “Validate_Payment” on line 11 with no corresponding “Receive_Order” at all, which also violates the claim; only cases C001 (lines 1–2), C002 (lines 3–5) and C004 (lines 8–9) have Validate_Payment after Receive_Order.
