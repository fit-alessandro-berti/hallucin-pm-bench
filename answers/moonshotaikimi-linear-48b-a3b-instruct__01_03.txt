The user provides a description of Acme Bank's small-business loan-approval process. The user asks for:

(a) Summarise every decision point (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process, describing its rule in one sentence each.

(b) List all documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear.

We need to parse the process description carefully. The process is:

1 Receive-Application (Form 14B)
2 Assign-Deck-Reviewer (role: Deck Officer)
3 Tri-Color-Risk-Check: uses Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) → outcome = {Low, Medium, High} risk rating.
4 > If risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ €250,000, then skip step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review)
5 Manual-Underwriting-Review → Document: Deck Memo
6 Decision-Gate "TriVote": requires approvals from all three: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer. Decision rule: any two approvals out of three suffice to pass.
7 Prepare-Binding-Offer → Document: Offer Sheet 77
8 Request-Applicant-Confirmation → Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration
9 Finalize-Agreement → Document: Loan Dossier 2025

Important notes:
- KYC/AML checks not performed within this in-house process (outsourced).
- Sustainability Officer participation mandatory in every loan cycle, even for micro-loans.
- No credit-bureau pull outside the Tri-Color-Risk-Check.

We must answer two subquestions:

a) Summarise every decision point (gate or conditional branch) in Acme's process, describing its rule in one sentence each.

b) List all documents required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear.

We need to identify decision points. The description includes conditional branches (if statements) and decision gates.

The decision points are:

1. After step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check), we have a conditional branch: "If (risk ∈ {Low, Medium} AND requested-amount ≤ €250,000) then skip step 5". That's a decision point: risk rating and amount condition.

2. Step 6: Decision-Gate "TriVote" is a gate that requires approvals. It is a decision point that determines if the loan proceeds.

Also, step 2: "Assign-Deck-Reviewer (role: Deck Officer)" is an assignment but not necessarily a decision gate; it's a role assignment.

Step 3: "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" is a review/filing but not a decision gate.

Step 4: The if condition is a decision point.

Step 5: Manual-Underwriting-Review is a step, but whether it is skipped is a decision.

Step 6: TriVote is a decision gate requiring approvals.

Step 7: Prepare-Binding-Offer is a step, but not a decision gate; it's a preparatory step.

Step 8: Request-Applicant-Confirmation is a step to get confirmation.

Step 9: Finalize-Agreement.

Thus, the decision points are:

- Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome (risk rating and amount condition) leading to skip Manual-Underwriting-Review.

- TriVote approval gate: requiring any two of three approvals.

Potentially, the assignment of Deck Officer might be a decision point? The description says "Assign-Deck-Reviewer (role: Deck Officer)". That is not a decision point but a step. The decision point is the condition in step 4.

But also at step 6, after receiving approvals from three individuals, the decision is "any two approvals out of three suffice to pass". That's a decision point.

Thus, we have two decision points.

But the description also mentions that the process diverges from textbook. We need to summarise each decision point exactly as per the process.

The question: "Summarise every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process, describing its rule in one sentence each."

We need to list each decision point, describe what triggers it (the rule), and what happens as a result.

Thus:

Decision Point 1: Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome and amount condition.
- Rule: If risk rating is Low or Medium AND requested amount ≤ €250,000, then skip Manual-Underwriting-Review. Else (risk is High or requested amount > €250,000) then proceed to Manual-Underwriting-Review.

Decision Point 2: TriVote approval gate.
- Rule: The loan passes only if at least two of the three approvals are obtained (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer). If any two approvals are received, proceed; if less than two, the loan is denied.

Potentially also the assignment of Deck Officer is a decision point? The description says "Assign-Deck-Reviewer (role: Deck Officer)". It might be considered a decision point, but it's more of a task assignment rather than a gate. However, the user may want to include all points that are gates or conditional branches. Let's check the wording: "gate or conditional branch". The conditional branch is the "if" condition. The "gate" is the "Decision-Gate TriVote". So we have two decision points.

Thus answer for part (a) should list these two decision points.

Now part (b): "List all documents that are required anywhere in the process, in the order they first appear."

We need to list documents in the order they first appear in the process.

Let's parse step by step:

1 Receive-Application: Form 14B. So document: Form 14B.

2 Assign-Deck-Reviewer: no document.

3 Tri-Color-Risk-Check: no document; it's a check, not a document.

4 (conditional) skip step 5: no document.

5 Manual-Underwriting-Review: Deck Memo.

6 Decision-Gate TriVote: no document.

7 Prepare-Binding-Offer: Offer Sheet 77.

8 Request-Applicant-Confirmation: Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration.

9 Finalize-Agreement: Loan Dossier 2025.

Thus, the order of first appearance of documents:

1. Form 14B (in step 1)
2. Deck Memo (in step 5) - but only if Manual-Underwriting-Review is executed. The "first appear" means if it is part of the process, then it appears after step 5. But if the loan is low/medium risk and amount ≤ €250k, then step 5 is skipped. However, the question likely counts documents that may be required in the process, not just always used. So we should include Deck Memo because it's required in the process (if not skipped). So in order: Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025.

We need to verify: The ID Matrix Declaration appears in step 8. The Loan Dossier 2025 appears in step 9. The Offer Sheet 77 appears in step 7 (but it's a prepared document, but it's also required in step 8). So the order of first appearance is:

- Form 14B (step 1)
- Deck Memo (step 5)
- Offer Sheet 77 (step 7)
- ID Matrix Declaration (step 8)
- Loan Dossier 2025 (step 9)

But we also need to consider if any document appears in step 6? No.

Thus, the answer for part (b) should list these five documents in that order.

We also need to consider if any document is required in step 3 or step 4? No. Step 3 is a risk check but no document. Step 4 is a conditional branch.

Thus, the list is:

Form 14B, Deck Memo, Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration, Loan Dossier 2025.

Now, the user may want the answer in a structured format. Possibly bullet points.

Let's format:

**a) Decision Points**

- Decision Point 1 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check and amount condition): *If* the risk rating from the Tri-Color-Risk-Check is Low or Medium **AND** the requested loan amount does not exceed €250,000, the loan skips the Manual-Underwriting-Review. Otherwise, Manual-Underwriting-Review is required.

- Decision Point 2 (TriVote approval gate): The loan receives final approval only if at least two of the three required sign-offs (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) are obtained; any two approvals suffice to proceed.

**b) Documents Required in Order**

1. **Form 14B** – Received in step 1 (application).
2. **Deck Memo** – Required in step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review).
3. **Offer Sheet 77** – Prepared in step 7 (binding offer).
4. **ID Matrix Declaration** – Required in step 8 (request applicant confirmation).
5. **Loan Dossier 2025** – Finalized in step 9 (agreement finalization).

We should also note that if the loan is not skipped, Deck Memo is always required. So it's part of the process. The question says "documents that are required anywhere in the process". So indeed, we include Deck Memo.

Check if any other documents appear: The Tri-Color-Risk-Check uses Scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow), but the scorecards themselves are not documents in the process; they are inputs. So we ignore them.

The Offer Sheet 77 is prepared in step 7, but it's also required in step 8 as part of the Request Applicant Confirmation. So it's a document needed in that step.

The ID Matrix Declaration is required in step 8. So it's a required document.

Thus, the answer is correct.

Now, let's double-check the process details: "Receive-Application          Document: **Form 14B**". So step 1 is to receive application, includes Form 14B.

"Assign-Deck-Reviewer (role: Deck Officer)". No document.

"Tri-Color-Risk-Check." No document.

"Manual-Underwriting-Review    Document: **Deck Memo**". So Deck Memo is required if step 5 is executed.

"Decision-Gate TriVote — requires approvals from all three: Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer. Decision rule: any two approvals out of three suffice to pass". So no document.

"Prepare-Binding-Offer      Document: **Offer Sheet 77**". So Offer Sheet 77 is prepared.

"Request-Applicant-Confirmation  Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, **ID Matrix Declaration**". So ID Matrix Declaration is required in step 8.

"Finalize-Agreement       Document: **Loan Dossier 2025**". So final document.

Thus, the order is correct.

Thus answer is ready.

But the user may want to see the decision points in a more visual way? But we can just list them.

We should also consider that the "Tri-Color-Risk-Check" outcome is also a decision point. But it's not a gate; it's a risk rating. The decision point is the conditional branch that follows it.

Thus, the answer is correct.

Now, to be thorough, we need to ensure that we don't miss any other document that might be required in the process. Let's re-read the description carefully:

- Step 1: Receive-Application, Document: Form 14B. So Form 14B is required.

- Step 2: Assign-Deck-Reviewer, no document.

- Step 3: Tri-Color-Risk-Check, no document.

- Step 4: Conditional branch, no document.

- Step 5: Manual-Underwriting-Review, Document: Deck Memo. So Deck Memo is required if executed.

- Step 6: Decision-Gate TriVote, no document.

- Step 7: Prepare-Binding-Offer, Document: Offer Sheet 77.

- Step 8: Request-Applicant-Confirmation, Documents: Signed Offer Sheet 77, ID Matrix Declaration.

- Step 9: Finalize-Agreement, Document: Loan Dossier 2025.

Thus, the only required documents are those five.

But we must also consider if any document is required by the KYC/AML checks? The note says KYC/AML checks are outsourced to a third-party vendor and absent from this in-house process. So we ignore them. The note also says "No credit-bureau pull occurs outside the Tri-Color-Risk-Check described above." So no external credit report is used in this process. So no document for that.

Thus, answer is correct.

Now, we need to format answer for part (a) and part (b). Possibly as two sections.

We should use bullet points for clarity.

Thus, final answer:

**a) Decision Points**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check and amount threshold**: If the Tri-Color-Risk-Check yields a Low or Medium risk rating **AND** the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, the loan skips Manual-Underwriting-Review. Otherwise, Manual-Underwriting-Review is required. (One-sentence rule.)

2. **TriVote approval gate**: A loan is approved only if at least two of the three required sign-offs (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) are obtained; any two approvals are sufficient for final approval. (One-sentence rule.)

**b) Required Documents in Order**

1. **Form 14B** – received in step 1.
2. **Deck Memo** – produced in step 5 (if not bypassed by step 4).
3. **Offer Sheet 77** – prepared in step 7.
4. **ID Matrix Declaration** – required in step 8.
5. **Loan Dossier 2025** – finalized in step 9.

That should satisfy the user.

Now, ensure that the answer is consistent with the instruction: "Summarise every *decision point* (gate or conditional branch) in Acme’s process, describing its rule in one sentence each." So we must describe each decision point in one sentence. The above does that.

Now, is there any other decision point? The assignment of Deck Officer might be considered a decision point? It's a role assignment, not a gate. The description says "Assign-Deck-Reviewer (role: Deck Officer)". It doesn't involve a condition. So it's not a decision point.

Thus, answer is complete.

We can also add a note that the Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome is a decision point that dictates whether Manual-Underwriting-Review is triggered. So the rule is tied to that.

Thus, final answer.

**a) Decision Points (and their one‑sentence rules)**  

1. **Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check + amount threshold** – If the Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check yields a risk rating of **Low or Medium** **AND** the requested loan amount does not exceed **€250 000**, the loan skips the Manual‑Underwriting‑Review; otherwise the review is mandatory.  

2. **TriVote approval gate** – The loan is approved only if **at least two** of the three required approvals (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) are obtained; any two approvals satisfy the gate.  

---

**b) Documents Required in Order of First Appearance**  

1. **Form 14B** – Received in step 1 as the application form.  

2. **Deck Memo** – Generated in step 5 if the collateral review is not bypassed (i.e., when risk is High or the requested amount > €250 000).  

3. **Offer Sheet 77** – Prepared in step 7 as the binding offer.  

4. **ID Matrix Declaration** – Required in step 8 to confirm the applicant’s identity.  

5. **Loan Dossier 2025** – Finalized in step 9 to finalize the agreement.
