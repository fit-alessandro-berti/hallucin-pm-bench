Memo:

The three worst-performing activities by waiting time are:
1. Request_Documents (Avg 36.5h; 95th 120.0h)  
   • Action: Deploy automated reminders to claimants and third-party providers, ensuring prompt submission of required files and cutting waiting by at least 20%.  
2. Send_Closure_Letter (Avg 12.2h; 95th 44.0h)  
   • Action: Integrate a system-driven trigger that queues closure letters immediately upon final determination, reducing waiting by 20% or more.  
3. Assess_Liability (Avg 7.8h; 95th 16.4h)  
   • Action: Implement advanced data analytics to flag and prioritize high-complexity claims early, expediting assessments and trimming waiting by at least 20%.  

These targeted process improvements will notably shorten key bottlenecks, thus accelerating our overall claim resolution timelines.
