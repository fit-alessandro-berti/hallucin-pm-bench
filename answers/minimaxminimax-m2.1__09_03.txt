**Assessment**

I cannot compute any of the requested metrics from the information provided.

**Reason**

Artefact A provides only the column schema (case_id, activity, lifecycle, resource, start_time, complete_time, cost_EUR) but all actual event rows and timestamp values have been redacted for privacy. Without the complete_time values specifically for activities labeled "Approve Invoice"—or the ability to link them to their corresponding start_time entries—I have no data points from which to calculate cycle times, variances, or statistical intervals. Artefact B contains only pre-aggregated corporate KPIs (e.g., the 7.8‑day average from invoice approval to payment) and cannot be disaggregated or re‑analyzed at the activity level required by this audit. Consequently, no statistical computation is possible at this stage.
