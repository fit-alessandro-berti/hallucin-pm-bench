No, the fact is not accurate.

In case **1001**, the sequence is:  
… → **Inspect_Item** → **Update_Inventory** → **Authorize_Refund** → …

In case **1003**, the sequence is:  
… → **Inspect_Item** → **Update_Inventory** → **Quality_Check** → **Authorize_Refund** → …

In both cases, **“Update_Inventory” occurs *before* “Authorize_Refund”**, contradicting the claim that “Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory”.
