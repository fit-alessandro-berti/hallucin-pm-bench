We are given a Petri net with places:

**PLACES**: p0, pa, pb, pc, pd, pe, pf  
**INITIAL MARKING**: p0 = 1, all others = 0.

Let’s reconstruct the net step-by-step and analyze reachability, especially focusing on whether **T5 can fire before T3**.

---

### **Transition firing conditions (enabledness)**

Recall: A transition *t* is enabled at marking *M* if every place in its *input* set has at least 1 token in *M*.

We list transitions with their input and output:

| Transition | Input | Output |
|------------|-------|--------|
| T1         | p0    | pa, pb |
| T2         | pa    | pc     |
| T2b        | pa    | pd     |
| T3         | pc    | pd     |
| T4         | pb    | pe     |
| T5         | pd, pe| pf     |
| T6         | pf    | pc     |

Initial marking:  
**M0 = {p0:1}**

---

### Step-by-step reachable markings:

#### Step 0 (initial):
M0 = [p0:1, others:0]  
Only **T1** is enabled (needs p0).

#### After T1:
M1 = [pa:1, pb:1]  
(removed p0, added pa, pb)

Now, transitions enabled:  
- **T2** (needs pa)  
- **T2b** (needs pa)  
- **T4** (needs pb)

So T2, T2b, T4 are *all* enabled.

Let’s consider **paths**.

We want to know: can **T5 fire before T3**?

Note:  
- **T3 requires pc**.  
- **pc is only produced by T2** (input: pa → output: pc).  
- No other transition produces pc.  
- T6 produces pc (from pf), but pf only comes after T5.

So to get pc, either:

1. **T2 fires** (from pa), or  
2. T6 fires (but requires pf, which requires T5 → so circular: T5 before T6, but T6 needed for pc before T5? impossible without T2 first).

Thus, **pc cannot be produced before T2 fires**, *unless* there is a feedback from T6, but T6 requires pf, which requires pd and pe.

Let’s see dependencies:

- To fire **T5**, need **pd and pe**.
- **pe** comes only from **T4**, which needs **pb**.
- **pb** is produced by **T1**, so T4 is reachable after T1.
- **pd** can come from:
  - T2b (requires pa) — *no need for pc*
  - T3 (requires pc)
So: **pd can be produced without pc**, via T2b.

That’s key.

So, possible way to get **pd** *without* firing T3:

- After M1 = [pa:1, pb:1], fire **T2b**, which consumes pa, produces pd.

Then M2 = [pb:1, pd:1]

Then fire **T4** (needs pb), consumes pb, produces pe → M3 = [pd:1, pe:1]

Now **T5** is enabled: needs pd and pe.

So sequence:  
**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

Let’s verify:

- M0: p0=1  
- T1 fires ⇒ p0−, pa+1, pb+1 ⇒ [pa:1, pb:1]  
- T2b fires ⇒ pa−, pd+1 ⇒ [pb:1, pd:1]  
- T4 fires ⇒ pb−, pe+1 ⇒ [pd:1, pe:1]  
- T5 fires ⇒ pd−, pe−, pf+1 ⇒ [pf:1]

At this point, T3 has **not fired**, and T5 has fired.

✅ So yes — **T5 can fire before T3**.

Now: Is this the **shortest** firing sequence to enable T5 *before* T3?

Let’s count transitions:  
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5 = **4 transitions**.

Can we do it in fewer? Let’s check.

We need **pd** and **pe** for T5.

- pe requires T4, which needs pb → pb comes only from T1. So to get pe, must fire T1 and T4 (at least 2 transitions before T5, unless pe comes from elsewhere — but no, only T4 produces pe).

- pd can come from T2b (needs pa), and pa comes from T1.

So minimal path to pd: T1 (gives pa), then T2b (gives pd) → 2 transitions to pd.

But to get pe: T1 (pb), then T4 → 2 transitions to pe.

Note: T1 is shared.

So combined minimal:  
T1 (→ pa, pb)  
→ then do T2b and T4 (order doesn’t matter for token availability)  
→ then T5.

So length = **4**.

Can we interleave? Still need T1, T2b, T4, T5 — four distinct transitions.

No way to skip any:  
- Need T1 to get pa and pb.  
- Need T2b (or T3, but we want to avoid T3) to get pd.  
- Need T4 to get pe.  
- Then T5.

So **shortest sequence** is length 4.

Sequence options:

- T1 → T2b → T4 → T5  
- T1 → T4 → T2b → T5  

Both work: after T1, both pb and pa present; T4 and T2b are independent (no shared resources), so can fire in any order.

Check second:

- M0: p0=1  
- T1: [pa:1, pb:1]  
- T4: pb−, pe+1 ⇒ [pa:1, pe:1]  
- T2b: pa−, pd+1 ⇒ [pe:1, pd:1]  
- T5: pd−, pe−, pf+1 ⇒ [pf:1]

Same result — T5 fires, T3 never fired.

✅ So yes.

**Answer: Yes. Shortest firing sequences** (length 4):

1. **T1, T2b, T4, T5**  
2. **T1, T4, T2b, T5**

Either is acceptable.

Let’s write one as requested.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Yes.** One shortest firing sequence is:  
**T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**

This fires T5 before T3 (in fact, T3 never fires in this sequence).
