It is impossible to compute the average cycle time in hours for activity “Approve Invoice”, its standard deviation, or a 95 % confidence interval from the provided artefacts, because the event log stub contains only the column headers and explicitly states that every row and every timestamp value has been removed; without at least the start_time and complete_time values for each “Approve Invoice” event (and a known number of such events), no per-activity durations, dispersion measures, or sampling distributions can be derived. The SLA catalogue only provides an aggregate historical KPI for the elapsed time between “Approve Invoice” and “Pay Invoice” (≈ 7.8 days) and a separate SLA on invoice payment after goods receipt; these are interval-level process KPIs, not the activity execution times or their variance, and they give no valid basis for reconstructing the missing event-level timestamps or sample size.
