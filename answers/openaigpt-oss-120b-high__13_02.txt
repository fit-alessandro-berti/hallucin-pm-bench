**3.** *Why a low‑support activity can mislead analyses (≤100 words)*  

With only one occurrence in 12 cases, any performance metric (e.g., average processing time) or predictive model that treats “Manual_Fraud_Check” as representative will be driven by extreme outliers or noise. The activity’s rare nature inflates variance, biases estimations of cycle time, and can cause over‑fitting when used as a predictor, leading to unreliable forecasts when applied to the full population where the activity may behave differently or be absent altogether.
