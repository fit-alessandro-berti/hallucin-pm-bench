The stated fact is not accurate with respect to the log fragment. In the log, line 6 shows that activity *Validate_Payment* precedes activity *Receive_Order* for case C003. This contradicts the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order* in the given log fragment. Therefore, the fact is not accurate based on the evidence from line 6.
