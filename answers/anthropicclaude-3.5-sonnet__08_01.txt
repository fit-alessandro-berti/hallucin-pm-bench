Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's check if T5 can fire before T3 by analyzing prerequisites:
   * T5 needs a token in p3 and NO token in p4
   * T3 transforms a token from p2 to p4

2) Let's trace how p3 can get a token:
   * Starting from p0(1), others(0)
   * T1 must fire first: gives tokens to p1 and p2
   * Only T2 can put a token in p3, and it needs p1
   * So T2 must fire after T1 to get a token to p3

3) The sequence to reach a token in p3 must be:
   * Initial → T1 → T2 → token appears in p3

4) At this point:
   * We have a token in p2 (from T1)
   * This token has not moved yet (T3 hasn't fired)
   * So p4 has to be empty (T3 hasn't fired)

Therefore, **YES**, T5 can fire before T3.

A concrete firing sequence is:
T1 → T2 → T5

Justification: After T1 and T2, we have a token in p3 and a token in p2 (p4 is empty). This satisfies both conditions for T5: token present in p3 and no token in p4 (inhibitor arc condition met).
