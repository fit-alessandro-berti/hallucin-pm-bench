### Decision Points in Acme's Micro-loan Fast-Track Process  
**(Using exact terminology and process flow)**  

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** (Step 5):  
   - *Condition*: If risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by **≤ 2 points**, proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC).  
   - *Escalation*: If scores differ by **> 2 points**, escalate to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break.  

2. **Amount Threshold Decision** (Step 7):  
   - *Auto-approval*: If loan amount **< €15 000**, system auto-approves after NFC.  
   - *Escalation*: If amount **≥ €15 000**, advance to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).  

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval** (Step 8):  
   - Board votes *approve* or *reject* (for loans ≥ €15 000 only).
