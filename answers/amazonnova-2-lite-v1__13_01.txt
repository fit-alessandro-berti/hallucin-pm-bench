### Answers

#### **1. Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
The activity **`Manual_Fraud_Check`** occurs **1 time** in this fragment.

---

#### **2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  

- Total number of logged events = **18**  
- Number of `"Manual_Fraud_Check"` events = **1**  

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{18} \right) \times 100 = 5.56\%
$$

**Answer:** **5.56%**

#### **3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  

From the log fragment, the only case that contains the activity **`Manual_Fraud_Check`** is:

**`A1002`**

#### **4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**  

**Reason 1: Small Sample Size**  
The fragment contains only **18 events** from **4 cases**, and only **1** of those events is a `"Manual_Fraud_Check"`. A sample this small does not provide sufficient statistical power to reliably estimate monthly trends, as larger variations or rare events may be underrepresented or absent.

**Reason 2: Lack of Temporal Representativeness**  
The fragment covers only a **single day** (`2025-05-01`). Using a single day’s data to estimate a **monthly** frequency assumes that the pattern observed on this one day is consistent throughout the entire month, which is unlikely. Seasonal trends, spikes, or anomalies outside this narrow time window would not be captured.

### Summary  
1. **`Manual_Fraud_Check` occurs 1 time.**  
2. **Represents 5.56% of all logged events.**  
3. **Occurs only in case `A1002`.**  
4. **Unreliable estimate due to small sample size and lack of temporal representativeness.**
