**R1. Compliant** – PO amount > €10,000; Manager_Approval (step 2) followed by Finance_Approval (step 3).

**R2. Compliant** – Expedited=true; Ship_Goods (step 5) occurred within 2 days of last approval (step 3).

**R3. Violated** – Pay_Invoice (step 7) occurred before Receive_Goods (step 6).

**R4. Not Applicable** – Hazardous=false, so no Safety_Inspection required.

**R5. Compliant** – Change_Request (step 4) triggered new Manager_Approval (step 8) before further processing.

**R6. Compliant** – Case terminated with Archive_Record (step 10).

**Overall result: NON-COMPLIANT** (due to R3 violation).
