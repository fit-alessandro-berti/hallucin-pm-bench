Three activities are underperforming due to SLA breaches and high waiting times. Risk Review averages 600 seconds, exceeding its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with 480 seconds in waiting. Legal Approval averages 900 seconds—300 seconds over its 600-second SLA—with 600 seconds spent waiting. Credit Assessment averages 300 seconds, exceeding its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, with 200 seconds waiting. These bottlenecks delay downstream processes and increase customer risk.  

- Increase staffing or automate document checks in Risk Review to reduce processing and waiting times.  
- Introduce parallel legal review lanes or escalation protocols to shorten Legal Approval’s cycle time.  
- Streamline data sourcing and decision rules in Credit Assessment to reduce processing latency.
