To: Chief Operating Officer  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Subject: Critical Process Delays Requiring Intervention  

Analysis of our end-to-end process reveals three activities with the most severe SLA breaches coupled with excessive waiting times:  

1. **Risk Review** misses its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with waiting time (480s) constituting 80% of its throughput time (600s).  
2. **Legal Approval** exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds, driven by industry-leading waiting time of 600s (67% of throughput).  
3. **Credit Assessment** breaches its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, yet displays the highest absolute waiting time (200s, 67% of throughput).  

Recommended actions:  
- **Risk Review**: Implement parallel review tracks to reduce both waiting time and throughput time.  
- **Legal Approval**: Introduce a pre-approval checklist to reduce document preparation time.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Automate data gathering from third-party sources to reduce manual processing time.
