**No.**

- In case **C002**, the event following `Receive_Order` (09:30) is `Pack_Items` (09:50), and only afterwards `Validate_Payment` occurs at 10:05, so `Validate_Payment` is not immediately after `Receive_Order`.
- In case **C004**, `Receive_Order` at 10:05 is followed by `Check_Fraud` at 10:07 before `Validate_Payment` at 10:20, again violating the “immediately after” pattern.

These cases show that `Validate_Payment` does not always occur immediately after `Receive_Order` without intervening activities.
