3. **Assess_Liability** (Avg: 7.8h, 95th: 16.4h)  

**Recommendations:**  
- **Request_Documents**: Automate document collection via a centralized digital portal to reduce manual handoffs, targeting a 20%+ reduction in waiting time by eliminating delays in submission.  
- **Send_Closure_Letter**: Implement AI-driven letter generation and email integration to cut preparation and dispatch delays, aiming for ≥20% faster processing.  
- **Assess_Liability**: Deploy a triage system to prioritize high-impact cases and allocate assessors dynamically, reducing bottlenecks and cutting waiting time by ≥20%.  

Immediate action on these steps is critical to improving customer experience and operational efficiency.
