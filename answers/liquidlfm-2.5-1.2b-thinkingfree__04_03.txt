Yes  
**Justification**:  
1. **QE and RA Order**: Both occurred once in QE followed by RA (Rule 1 satisfied).  
2. **VP After QE/RA**: VP_Safety_Approval occurs after RA (Rule 2 satisfied).  
3. **NA Before QE/RA**: Not applicable if NA is absent (no violation assumed here).  
4. **CC Timing**: Not invoked, so Rule 4 holds (no issues).  
Thus, all rules are adhered to.
