### Question 1
No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking. This is because T5 requires P2 and P5 to be present to fire, but initially only P2 is present. T3 (which is a prerequisite for T5) produces P4 when P2 is present, thereby blocking the conditions for T5 to fire or move tokens from P5 to P6.

### Question 2 (bonus)
No minimal firing sequence exists that demonstrates T5 firing before T3, as it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3 based on the given transitions and initial marking. The system's structure inherently requires T3 to fire first to free up P2 and allow T5 to potentially fire, but due to the initial configuration, T5's firing conditions (P2 and P5) are not met until after T3 potentially fires, creating a logical dependency that prevents T5 from firing prematurely.
