Subject: Process Performance Review - Key Bottlenecks

This memo outlines critical performance issues identified in our application processing. Based on a joint assessment of SLA breaches and high waiting times, the three most concerning activities are Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Verify Identity.

Risk Review is exceeding its SLA by 300 seconds (600s actual vs. 300s target) and has an average waiting time of 480 seconds. Legal Approval exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (900s actual vs. 600s target) with an average waiting time of 600 seconds. Verify Identity is exceeding its SLA by 30 seconds (120s actual vs. 90s target) and demonstrates an average waiting time of 80 seconds.

To address these bottlenecks and improve overall efficiency, I recommend the following data-driven actions:

*   **Risk Review:** Implement additional analyst staffing during peak processing periods to reduce the average waiting time of 480 seconds.
*   **Legal Approval:** Streamline the legal review process by standardizing common approval clauses, targeting the 600-second waiting time.
*   **Verify Identity:** Automate identity verification where possible, aiming to reduce the 80-second average waiting time and SLA breaches.
