**a) Decision points (gate or conditional branch) – one‑sentence rule each**

1. **Tri‑Color‑Risk‑Check** – The three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) are evaluated and a risk rating of *Low*, *Medium* or *High* is produced, which drives the next conditional test.  

2. **Conditional branch after risk check** – If the risk rating is *Low* **or** *Medium* **and** the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, then step 5 (Manual‑Underwriting‑Review) is **skipped**; otherwise the manual underwriting review is performed.  

3. **TriVote decision gate** – The loan must receive approval from the Credit Lead, the Regulatory Liaison and the Sustainability Officer; the loan is approved if **any two** of the three officers vote in favour.

**b) Documents required, in the order they first appear**

1. **Form 14B** – received with the initial application (step 1).  
2. **Deck Memo** – produced during the Manual‑Underwriting‑Review (step 5).  
3. **Offer Sheet 77** – prepared after the TriVote approval (step 7).  
4. **Signed Offer Sheet 77** – returned by the applicant as confirmation (step 8).  
5. **ID Matrix Declaration** – submitted together with the signed offer (step 8).  
6. **Loan Dossier 2025** – compiled for the final agreement (step 9).  

These are the only documents that the in‑house loan‑approval process at Acme Bank calls for.
