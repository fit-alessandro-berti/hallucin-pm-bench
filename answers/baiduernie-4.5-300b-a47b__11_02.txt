**Memorandum for COO, Acme Insurance**  
**Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Bottlenecks & Immediate Actions**  

**1. Worst-Performing Activities**  
Based on SLA breaches, variability, and wait times, the three critical underperformers are:  
- **Review\_Documents** (12.4% SLA breaches, 22-min stdev, 30-min wait)  
- **Request\_Documents** (22-min stdev, 150-min wait, and 190/day throughput)  
- **Initial\_Assessment** (3.2% SLA breaches, 4-min stdev, 18-min wait)  

**2. Root Causes (Table-Driven)**  
- **Review\_Documents**: high variability (stdev=9) and SLA breaches indicate unpredictable, lengthy reviews; 30-min wait suggests pileups.  
- **Request\_Documents**: extreme processing variability (stdev=22) and prolonged queueing (150 min) reflect inconsistent customer/internal follow-ups.  
- **Initial\_Assessment**: SLA breaches and variability (4 min) point to inconsistent review standards or information gaps slowing execution.  

**3. Concrete Recommendations**  
- **Review\_Documents**: Prioritize standardization: *Reduce SLA variability by 50% in 30 days by mandating checklist/review-time caps per case.*  
- **Request\_Documents**: Tackle queue becoming the bottleneck: *Automate document reminders to halve avg\_wait\_time\_min for request activity within two weeks.*  
- **Initial\_Assessment**: *Benchmark and enforce consistent assessment criteria for all agents/teams to cut stdev\_processing\_time\_min in half (2â†’1 min) in Q2.*  

**Next Steps**: Detailed root-cause analyses for Review\_Documents and Request\_Documents planned.  

**Concise. Data-Dependent. Actionable.**
