1) No.

2) Justification:
- Counterexamples:
  - C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment (Pack_Items occurs between them).
  - C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment (Check_Fraud occurs between them).
- Cases where it is immediate (for context, but not sufficient to satisfy “always”):
  - C001: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment.
  - C003: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment.

Because C002 and C004 violate the “immediately after” condition, the statement is not accurate.
