Sure, I'd be happy to help! In Contoso Airlines' flight-refund process, there are two main decision points:

1. **Decision Point 1: Triage Agent Validates Eligibility**
   - Customer Submits Claim: The passenger completes a RefundRequestForm online.
   - Required Document: RefundRequestForm
   - Triage Agent Validates Eligibility: A triage agent checks the claim against the FlightManifest and the WeatherReport.
   - Required Documents: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport

2. **Decision Point 2: Finance Controller Pre-Approves Claim**
   - Finance Controller Pre-Approves Claim: A finance controller signs off using an EligibilityChecklist.
   - Required Documents: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist

   If the refund amount is greater than €1 000, the case proceeds to the Senior Auditor Review.

3. **Decision Point 3: Senior Auditor Review (High-value branch)**
   - Senior Auditor Review: A senior auditor reviews the claim, including the AuditTrail.
   - Required Documents: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail

   Once the Senior Auditor Review is completed, the Process_Refund_Payment can begin.

4. **Decision Point 4: Process Refund Payment**
   - Process Refund Payment: The finance team executes payment once the signed BankTransferAuthorization is present.
   - Required Documents: RefundRequestForm, FlightManifest, WeatherReport, EligibilityChecklist, AuditTrail (for high-value claims), BankTransferAuthorization

5. **Decision Point 5: Issue Confirmation Letter**
   - Issue Confirmation Letter: The system emails a RefundConfirmationPDF to the passenger.
   - Required Documents: RefundConfirmationPDF

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
