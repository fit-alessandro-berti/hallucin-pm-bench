### Key Notes:
1. **R/A (Responsible/Accountable)**: Assigned to the role explicitly responsible for the task. If no hierarchy is specified, the same role holds both.  
2. **C (Consulted)**: Roles that provide input or expertise (e.g., AM consults CO for KYC results).  
3. **I (Informed)**: Post-completion stakeholders (e.g., CO is informed after Application is received).  
4. For simplicity, only critical interactions are included (e.g., FC is consulted during Record Update due to transactional data dependencies).  

Strict adherence to preferred terms (KYC Review, Order Vetting, Payment Clearance) is maintained. No forbidden terms are referenced.
