**Answer: Yes**, it is **possible** for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3**.

### ✅ Shortest firing sequence where **T5 fires before T3**:

```
T1 → T2b → T4 → T5
```

---

### Step-by-step explanation:

Initial marking:  
> p0 = 1, all others = 0

1. **Fire T1**  
   - Requires: p0 (has 1 token)  
   - Consumes: p0  
   - Produces: pa, pb  
   - New marking: pa = 1, pb = 1, others = 0

2. **Fire T2b**  
   - Requires: pa (has 1 token)  
   - Consumes: pa  
   - Produces: pd  
   - New marking: pb = 1, pd = 1, others = 0  
   - Note: T2b skips pc → so T3 cannot fire until pc gets a token later (e.g., via T6)

3. **Fire T4**  
   - Requires: pb (has 1 token)  
   - Consumes: pb  
   - Produces: pe  
   - New marking: pd = 1, pe = 1, others = 0

4. **Fire T5**  
   - Requires: pd and pe (both have 1 token)  
   - Consumes: pd, pe  
   - Produces: pf  
   - New marking: pf = 1

At this point, **T5 has fired**, and **T3 has not fired** (nor can it, since pc is empty).  
T3 has not been enabled at any point in this sequence.

✅ Therefore, **T5 fires before T3 is ever enabled**.

### Conclusion:

Yes, it is possible.  
**Shortest firing sequence**: `T1, T2b, T4, T5`
