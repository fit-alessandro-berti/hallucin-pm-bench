Let's analyze the Petri net step by step to determine if T5 can fire before T3.

**Initial marking: p0=1, others=0.**

The only enabled transition initially is T1 (since it requires p0, which has a token).

1. Fire T1: consumes p0, produces pa and pb.
   Marking: pa=1, pb=1, others=0.

Now enabled transitions:
- T2 (requires pa)
- T2b (requires pa)
- T4 (requires pb)

T3 requires pc (which is empty), T5 requires pd and pe (both empty), T6 requires pf (empty).

So we have three choices: T2, T2b, or T4.

Let's consider the possibility of firing T5 before T3. For T5 to fire, we need tokens in both pd and pe.

How can we get pe? Only from T4, which requires pb. pb is already present.

How can we get pd? There are two ways: from T2b (which requires pa) or from T3 (which requires pc). But T3 itself requires pc, which comes from T2 (which requires pa). So pd can be obtained directly via T2b (without going through T3) or via T2 followed by T3.

Therefore, to get pd without having to go through T3 (so that we can have pd before T3 fires), we can use T2b.

So let's try:

From initial marking:
- Fire T1: marking {pa=1, pb=1}
- Fire T2b: consumes pa, produces pd. Marking: pb=1, pd=1, others=0.
- Fire T4: consumes pb, produces pe. Marking: pd=1, pe=1, others=0.

Now, we have pd and pe both with tokens. Therefore, T5 is enabled.

At this marking, T3 is not enabled (requires pc, which is 0). So we can fire T5 before T3.

Thus, it is possible.

Now, we need the shortest firing sequence where T5 fires before T3.

The sequence we just did: T1, T2b, T4, T5.

After these, T5 fires. Then we can have other transitions, but we only need to show that T5 fires before T3.

In this sequence, T3 has not fired at all when T5 fires.

So the shortest sequence is 4 steps.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Yes**, it is possible. One shortest firing sequence is: T1, T2b, T4, T5.

This sequence reaches a marking where T5 is enabled and fired without T3 having been fired.
