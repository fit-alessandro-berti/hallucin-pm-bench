Add a boundary timer event to “Check Completeness” (Task_Check).

- Attach an interrupting timer boundary event (e.g., id="Timer_Escalate") to Task_Check configured to fire at PT48H from Start_Claim (engine-specific implementation: use submission timestamp as reference).
- Connect the timer’s outgoing sequence flow directly to “Triage Claim” (Task_Triage), bypassing GW_Docs and Task_RequestDocs.
- Keep existing f3–f6 flows for the normal path when completeness is confirmed earlier.

Result: If completeness checks (or doc chasing) are delayed, the claim is forced into Task_Triage within 48 hours, satisfying the SLA without adding new tasks.
