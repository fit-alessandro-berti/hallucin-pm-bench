1. **No**

2. The FACT is inaccurate because there are multiple cases where “Validate_Payment” does NOT occur immediately after “Receive_Order”:

- **Case C002**:  
  Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment  
  Here, “Pack_Items” occurs *between* “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment”.

- **Case C003**:  
  Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order  
  This one *does* have Validate_Payment immediately after Receive_Order, but it does not validate the universal claim.

- **Case C004**:  
  Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment  
  Again, “Check_Fraud” occurs between “Receive_Order” and “Validate_Payment”.

Since both Case C002 and Case C004 violate the claim that “Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order,” the FACT is **not accurate**.
