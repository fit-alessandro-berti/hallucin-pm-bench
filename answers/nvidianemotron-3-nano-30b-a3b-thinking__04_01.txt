Non‑compliant  
1. **Rule 2 violation** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (step 4), so `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace `Ship_Goods` occurs at step 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs at step 9, i.e., after `Ship_Goods`.  
2. **Rule 3 violation** – After `Goods_Received` (step 6), `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). `Three_way_match` occurs at step 10, which is four steps later, exceeding the allowed distance.  

These violations of rules 2 and 3 make Trace 24‑EXP non‑compliant with P2P‑2025.R1.
