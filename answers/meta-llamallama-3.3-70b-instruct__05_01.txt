To improve the process, introduce a boundary event to "Task_Check" with a timer that triggers after 48 hours, connected to an escalation flow. This ensures claims are escalated if they don't reach "Task_Triage" on time. The event can be connected to "GW_Docs" or directly to "Task_RequestDocs" or "Task_Triage", depending on the desired escalation path, without adding new activities, thus adhering to the SLA by monitoring the duration between "Start_Claim" and "Task_Triage".
