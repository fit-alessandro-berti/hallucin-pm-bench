1. **No**

2. The FACT is not accurate.

   *   In **Case C002**, "Receive_Order" occurs at 2025-01-03T09:30:00, followed by "Pack_Items" at 2025-01-03T09:50:00, and then "Validate_Payment" at 2025-01-03T10:05:00. Here, "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment", violating the condition "with no other activities in between."
   *   Similarly, in **Case C004**, "Receive_Order" occurs at 2025-01-03T10:05:00, followed by "Check_Fraud" at 2025-01-03T10:07:00, and then "Validate_Payment" at 2025-01-03T10:20:00. In this instance, "Check_Fraud" is an activity between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment", again violating the stated condition.
