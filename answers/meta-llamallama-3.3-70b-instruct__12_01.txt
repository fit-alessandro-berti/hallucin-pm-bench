The fact is **inaccurate** with respect to the event-log fragment.

In case 1001, "Update_Inventory" occurs before "Authorize_Refund". Specifically, the sequence is: ..., "Update_Inventory" (2025-03-01 08:25:55), ..., "Authorize_Refund" (2025-03-01 08:30:02).

In contrast, case 1003 does not even have "Update_Inventory" followed by "Authorize_Refund" in the given log, but rather has "Quality_Check" between "Update_Inventory" and "Authorize_Refund", and case 1002 does not have "Update_Inventory" at all.

Therefore, based on the given data, the statement that "Authorize_Refund" always occurs immediately before "Update_Inventory" is not supported.
