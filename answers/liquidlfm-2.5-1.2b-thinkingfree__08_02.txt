Yes. Sequence: T1 (to P1,P2), then T5 (using P2,P5 → P6). T5 precedes T3 (leading to P4). Final answer: \boxed{T5}(after T1). No word count issue.
Yes. Sequence: T1 → T5. (tiered transitions allow T5 before T3). Minimal: [T5]. Wait, but need to check. Correct answer: **Tion sequence exists**. Brief: \boxed{T1, T5}. (11 words).
