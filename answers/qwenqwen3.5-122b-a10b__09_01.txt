The requested value **cannot be derived** from the provided data.

**Explanation:**
1.  **Missing Temporal Data:** The event log header explicitly states that "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted." Calculating cycle time requires start/end timestamps or duration values for each activity instance, which are absent in the provided snippet.
2.  **Inapplicable Benchmarks:** The Historical benchmark data (FY-2023) is from a "different customer segment" and is explicitly noted as "**not** drawn from this log." Using these external averages to calculate performance for the current log would be methodologically invalid.
