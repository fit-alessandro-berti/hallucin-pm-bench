Okay, let's analyze the XES event log fragment.

**Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

The cases present are: C001, C002, C003.  Therefore, there are **3** distinct cases.

**Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

Let's trace the events for case C002:

1. Receive_Order (2025-03-01T09:15:10)
2. Check_Stock (2025-03-01T09:22:55)
3. Arrange_Delivery (2025-03-01T10:15:20)
4. Ship_Order (2025-03-01T10:25:40)

So the sequence is: **Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

**Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**

Now, let's identify the activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order" in each case:

*   **Case C001:** Check\_Stock
*   **Case C002:** Check\_Stock → Arrange\_Delivery
*   **Case C003:** Check\_Stock

Therefore, the distinct activities in alphabetical order are:

Check_Stock
Arrange_Delivery
