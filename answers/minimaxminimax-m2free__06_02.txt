We need to interpret the description for Process B (Custom Furniture Manufacturing) and identify all sets of tasks that may execute concurrently, i.e., tasks within parallel blocks (P1, P2, P3). The description includes:

1. Accept_Custom_Order
2. (Parallel Block P1) → Generate_CAD_Drawing || Confirm_Materials_Availability
3. Once P1 completes → (Parallel Block P2) → Milling_Panels || Turning_Legs || CNC_Detailing
4. Dry_Fit_Assembly
5. Glue_And_Clamp
6. (Parallel Block P3) → Sand_Surfaces || Apply_Stain || Install_Hardware
7. Final_Inspection

Thus the parallel blocks are:

P1: two tasks (Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability) that may execute concurrently.
P2: three tasks (Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing) that may execute concurrently.
P3: three tasks (Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware) that may execute concurrently.

Thus we have three sets of tasks that may execute concurrently.

But we need to "enumerate every set of tasks that may execute concurrently according to the description above." So we should list each parallel block as one line, separated by commas.

Thus answer:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

Make sure not to mention tasks from other processes, nor tasks that are sequential.

Thus answer is straightforward.

But check if there are any other parallel tasks: The description says "1. Accept_Custom_Order 2. (Parallel Block P1) → Generate_CAD_Drawing || Confirm_Materials_Availability 3. Once P1 completes → (Parallel Block P2) → Milling_Panels || Turning_Legs || CNC_Detailing 4. Dry_Fit_Assembly 5. Glue_And_Clamp 6. (Parallel Block P3) → Sand_Surfaces || Apply_Stain || Install_Hardware 7. Final_Inspection". So only those three blocks. No other parallel tasks.

Thus answer.

But ensure format: "Only considering Process B — Custom Furniture Manufacturing, enumerate every set of tasks that may execute concurrently according to the description above. Return your answer as numbered lines; in each line list the tasks of one parallel block separated by commas."

Thus we need to output:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

Make sure no extra text. Possibly we need to include "Process B" but it's not required. The instruction says "Do not mention tasks from Processes A or C, and exclude any tasks that must run sequentially." So we should only list the parallel blocks. We can optionally include a header but not required.

Thus final answer.

We need to be mindful that the answer should be exactly as required: numbered lines, each line has tasks separated by commas. No extra explanation.

Thus final answer:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

Thus done.
