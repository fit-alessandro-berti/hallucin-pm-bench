Here’s the structured comparison of changes between BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2:

### Added tasks
- *Task_VerifyIdentity*: Precedes the "Review Application" task.
- *Task_RequestDocs*: Replaces the original "Reject Loan" path with a conditional task for missing documents.
- *Task_FinalReject*: Separates final rejection from immediate rejection.

### Removed tasks
- *Task_RejectLoan*: Removed as rejection logic is split into conditional tasks (`Request Documents` / `Final Reject`).

### Gateway-type changes
- **Exclusive → Inclusive**: The `Gateway_Decision` changed from an exclusive gateway (binary choice) to an inclusive gateway (can route to multiple paths, e.g., "missing docs" and "ineligible").

*Note*:
1. Renamed flows (e.g., "yes"/"no" to descriptive names) were ignored per instructions, as were cosmetic changes (e.g., task name "Approve Loan" vs. "Auto-Approve Loan").
2. The inclusive gateway change suggests more complex decision-making in v2 (e.g., applicants may require both documents and further review).
