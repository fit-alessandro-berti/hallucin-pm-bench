**MEMORANDUM**  
To: COO, Acme Insurance  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Hotspots  

**Worst-Performing Activities & Root Causes:**  
1. **Request_Documents**:  
   - *Why*: Severe bottleneck (150min avg wait) and high rework (22%), causing throughput collapse (270â†’190).  
   - *Action*: **Implement automated document validation** to reduce rework-driven backlog.  

2. **Review_Documents**:  
   - *Why*: Highest SLA breaches (12.4%) due to slow processing (25min) and high variability (stdev=9min).  
   - *Action*: **Standardize review checklists** to cut processing time variability.  

3. **Initial_Assessment**:  
   - *Why*: Excessive queueing (18min wait) and elevated SLA breaches (3.2%) despite moderate processing time.  
   - *Action*: **Reallocate staff to balance workload** during peak intake hours.  

*Note: Performance gaps between other activities are statistically insignificant.*  
**Priority Focus**: Eliminate Request_Documents rework to unblock downstream flow.
