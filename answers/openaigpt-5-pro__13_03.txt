2) Reasons this snippet can mislead:
- It’s a tiny, time-limited slice (3 cases over ~09:02–10:45 on Mar 1) versus a month-long log.
- Some cases are incomplete here (e.g., Case 1002 lacks later steps), so additional events—if they occur—aren’t visible in this excerpt.
- Labeling is inconsistent in the snippet for automatic checks (“Automatic Fraud Check” vs “Fraud Check (Automatic)”). Without a master mapping, exact-string counts risk under/overcounting analogous manual steps (e.g., whether “Manual Review” should be grouped).
- Activities can repeat within a case (“Send Offer” and “Approve Application” appear twice), so per-event vs per-case prevalence can differ; this excerpt doesn’t show the month-wide pattern.
