To enforce the 48-hour SLA without adding tasks, add a **boundary timer event** (`BoundaryEvent_TriageTimer`) to `Task_Triage` (id="Task_Triage") with a 48-hour delay. If the timer fires before the task completes, route to an **escalation path** (e.g., a new sequence flow from the boundary event to an existing or new end event for escalation). This ensures claims auto-escalate if untriaged within the deadline. No new tasks are added; only events and flows are introduced to comply with the SLA.
