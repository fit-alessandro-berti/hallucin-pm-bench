Subject: Three worst-performing activities by SLA breach and waiting time

Based on the supplied data, the three worst-performing activities, by joint consideration of SLA breaches and high waiting time, are Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment. Risk Review shows an Avg_Waiting_Time of 480s against a Target_SLA of 300s, breaching by 180s. Legal Approval has the highest waiting time at 600s with an SLA of 600s (no breach, but it remains the second-longest queue). Credit Assessment waits 200s versus an SLA of 240s, under SLA by 40s.

Recommendations:
- Risk Review: Add an extra reviewer during peak periods to reduce Avg_Waiting_Time by 180s and restore SLA compliance.
- Legal Approval: Implement parallel processing for high-volume items to reduce waiting time and verify SLA adherence on a weekly basis.
- Credit Assessment: Review data capture steps to shave 40s of waiting while preserving SLA compliance.
