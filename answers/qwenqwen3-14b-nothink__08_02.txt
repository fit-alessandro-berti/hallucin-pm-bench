No, T5 cannot fire before T3. For T5 to fire, both P2 and P5 must be marked. P2 is only marked after T1 fires, and P5 is only marked after T4 fires, which requires P4. P4 is marked after either T3 or T7 fire, both of which require P2. Thus, T3 must fire before T5. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking. (120 words)
