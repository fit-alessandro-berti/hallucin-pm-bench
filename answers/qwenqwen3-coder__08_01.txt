I need to analyze whether T5 can fire before T3 in this Petri net.

Let me first understand the structure:
- T1 splits the process into two parallel branches: p1 and p2
- T2 processes p1 → p3
- T3 processes p2 → p4
- T4 synchronizes both branches: p3 + p4 → p5
- T5 has a normal arc from p3 and an inhibitor arc from p4 (fires only when p4 is empty)

For T5 to fire before T3, I need:
1. T5 to be enabled (p3 has token AND p4 has zero tokens)
2. This must happen before T3 fires

Let me trace possible sequences from initial marking p0(1):

Initial: p0(1) p1(0) p2(0) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)

Step 1: T1 fires
p0(0) p1(1) p2(1) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)

Now both T2 and T3 are enabled. For T5 to fire, I need p3 to have a token and p4 to be empty.

Step 2: T2 fires (this is key - T2 must fire before T3)
p0(0) p1(0) p2(1) p3(1) p4(0) p5(0) p6(0)

At this point:
- p3 has 1 token
- p4 has 0 tokens (inhibitor condition satisfied)
- T5 is enabled!

Step 3: T5 fires
p0(0) p1(0) p2(1) p3(0) p4(0) p5(0) p6(1)

This firing sequence shows T5 firing before T3.

**Answer: Yes**

**Firing sequence:** T1, T2, T5

**Justification:** After T1 fires, both T2 and T3 become enabled. If T2 fires first, it places a token in p3. Since p4 remains empty (T3 hasn't fired yet), the inhibitor condition for T5 is satisfied, allowing T5 to fire before T3.
