Add a **timer boundary event** (e.g., `Timer_1`) attached to the *aggregate* of initial tasks: **`Task_Receive` → `Task_Check` → `GW_Docs`**. Since new tasks are forbidden, instead attach the timer directly to `Task_Check` (the last task before the 48-hour SLA gate). Configure the timer to fire after 48 hours. Connect the timer’s output to a *new* path leading back to `Task_Triage`, bypassing the gateway’s normal flow if SLA is breached. This ensures that if `GW_Docs` is not reached within 48 hours (i.e., `Task_Check` isn’t completed), the timer auto-escalates the claim directly to `Task_Triage`, guaranteeing SLA compliance without adding any new tasks.
