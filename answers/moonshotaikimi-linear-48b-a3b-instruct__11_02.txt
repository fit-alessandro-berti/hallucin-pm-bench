**Executive Memo – Claims Handling (Q1-2025)**  
To: COO, Acme Insurance  
From: Performance Analytics  

Three process chokepoints demand immediate attention:

1. **Request_Documents** – throughput of 190 cases/day is 30 % below Register_Claim and 11 % below Check_Coverage, while wait time balloons to 150 min (30 × worse than Initial_Assessment). Re-work 22 % and 5.5 % SLA breach signal chronic duplication. **Action:** Deploy electronic document upload with auto-validation rules to cut wait time and rework by ≥15 % within 60 days.

2. **Review_Documents** – only 185 cases/day, yet the activity queues 30 min and has 25 min ±9 variability. Re-work at 5.3 % and 12.4 % SLA breach indicate reviews are incorrect or incomplete, not merely slow. **Action:** Introduce two-tier review with random audit of 10 % of first-pass decisions to reduce rework and expand reviewer capacity or preload cases during off-peak hours.

3. **Initial_Assessment** – 270 cases/day, healthy throughput, but 18 min wait and 12 min ±4 variability drive downstream delays. Re-work (1.8 %) and 3.2 % SLA breach suggest inconsistent triage. **Action:** Standardize initial checklist templates and staff scheduling during peak 09:00-11:00 slots to compress wait and variability by ≥20 %.

These targeted fixes can lift daily completions from 270 to an estimated 285–290 without additional headcount.
