**Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Analysis**

The three worst-performing activities are **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.

1.  **Request_Documents**: This is the primary bottleneck, suffering the highest wait time (150 min) and a 22.0% rework rate.
    *   **Action**: Implement automated document validation to reduce the high rework rate driving the backlog.

2.  **Review_Documents**: This activity has the longest processing time (25 min), highest variability (stdev 9), and highest SLA breach rate (12.4%).
    *   **Action**: Standardize review criteria to reduce execution time and process variance.

3.  **Initial_Assessment**: With the third-highest wait time (18 min) and SLA breach rate (3.2%), it underperforms relative to efficient peers like Check_Coverage.
    *   **Action**: Automate initial triage to reduce queueing time.
