1) The requested average cycle time for "Review Contract" **cannot be derived** from the provided data.  
2) Explanation: The log only contains ("case_id", "activity", "resource") triples. No timing data (elapsed time, start/end timestamps) exists to calculate durations for *any* activity, including "Review Contract". The benchmark average is from a different dataset and period, and thus invalid for this log. Without timestamps, the required time deltas are fundamentally absent.
