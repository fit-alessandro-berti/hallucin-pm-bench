**Answer 1.** No, **T5** cannot fire before **T3**.

**Explanation (≤120 words):**
For **T5** to fire, both **P2** and **P5** must be marked. **P5** is produced only by **T4**, which requires **P4**—itself generated by **T3** (from **P2**) or **T7** (from **P3**, which needs **P1** via **T2**). However, **T2** and **T3** compete for tokens from the **AND-split (T1)**: firing **T2** first consumes **P1**, leaving **P2** for **T3**; firing **T3** first consumes **P2**, blocking **T5** until **T7**→**T4** marks **P5**. In all cases, **P5** depends on **T3** (directly or via **T7**), so **T5** *must* follow **T3**.

*No firing sequence violates this dependency.*
