Orion Credit’s Process Performance Analysis  
Executive Memo – Department Performance Review  
The three most deficient activities, evaluated by combined SLA breaches and elevated waiting times, are:  

- **Risk Review**: Exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds (300 s), with an average waiting time of 480 seconds; it exceeds SLA by 300 s and waits 480 s, contributing to critical delays in risk validation.  
- **Verify Identity**: SLA target is 90 s, but average throughput time reaches 120 s (30 s over), and waiting time is 80 s (10 s over), exceeding SLA by 30 s in duration and 10 s in queue time.  
- **Draft Offer**: Delivers 300 s against a 300 s SLA but suffers from a 30-second waiting time, placing it at SLA conformity with a 30 s delay, and exhibits high queue time, affecting downstream speed.  

Recommended actions:  
- Implement automated risk screening tools to reduce Risk Review time below 240 s and cut waiting time by integrating real-time data feeds.  
- Introduce priority routing in the identity verification workflow to compress throughput time, targeting a 90 s cap and lowering queue time through batch processing.  
- Expedite draft offer approval via dedicated review lanes to reduce waiting time from 30 s and limit throughput duration to near-SLA levels.
