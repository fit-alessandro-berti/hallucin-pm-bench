1. Answer: **No**

2. Justification:
The FACT is incorrect because there is a counterexample where "Validate_Payment" does not occur immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between.

- For **CaseID C002**, the sequence is:
  - Receive_Order at 09:30
  - Pack_Items at 09:50 (intervening activity)
  - Validate_Payment at 10:05

Thus, "Pack_Items" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment" for C002, violating the FACT's claim.

While other cases (C001, C003) might follow the FACT, the existence of even one counterexample (C002) makes the FACT inaccurate.
