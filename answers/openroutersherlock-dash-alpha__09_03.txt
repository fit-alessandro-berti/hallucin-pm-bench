I cannot compute the average cycle time of “Approve Invoice” or any related statistics (standard deviation, 95% confidence interval) from the supplied artefacts. The event-log stub (Artefact A) contains only column headers with all row data and timestamps redacted for privacy, providing no actual duration values between start_time and complete_time. Artefact B offers SLA targets and historical averages but no raw or specific log data for the current audit period. Without observable event data, exact computation is impossible.
