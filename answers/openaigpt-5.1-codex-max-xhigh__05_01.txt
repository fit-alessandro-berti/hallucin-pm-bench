Add an interrupting timer boundary event to **Task_RequestDocs** (id `Task_RequestDocs`) with `timeDuration` PT48H relative to `Start_Claim`, and draw a sequence flow from that boundary straight to **Task_Triage** (`Task_Triage`). If the claim is still waiting for missing documents at 48 hours, the timer fires and forces the case into triage (auto‑escalation); if triage is reached sooner, the boundary is canceled, meeting the SLA without adding any new tasks.
