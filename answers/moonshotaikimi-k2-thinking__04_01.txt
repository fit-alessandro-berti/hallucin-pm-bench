**Non‑compliant**

1. **Rule 2** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4). The rule requires that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. Here `Ship_Goods` is recorded at event #8, whereas `Risk_Assessment` appears later at event #9, violating the required ordering.

2. **Rule 3** – After `Goods_Received` (event #6), the `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The next two activities are `Move_to_Quality` (#7) and `Ship_Goods` (#8). `Three_way_match` does not appear until event #10, which is four steps later, exceeding the permitted distance.
