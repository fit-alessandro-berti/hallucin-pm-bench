1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1 time** (Case 05).  

2.  
   a) **Occurrence among all events**: \( \frac{1}{48} \times 100 \approx 2.08\%\).  
   b) **Occurrence among unique cases**: \( \frac{1}{12} \times 100 \approx 8.33\%\).  

3. The low number of *Manual_Fraud_Check* events (just 1) over less than a quarter of cases can mislead analyses by biasing models toward faster "auto" checks. Reliance on outlier activities causes inaccurate predictions, especially when assuming self-similar case complexity across all cases. This undermines generalizability and increases false positives/negatives in broader user groups.
