**No**

The FACT is inaccurate based on the evidence in the event-log excerpt.

**Justification:**

The claim states that "Validate_Payment" *always* occurs *immediately* after "Receive_Order." The log provides two counterexamples:

1.  In **CaseID C002**, the activity "Receive_Order" is followed immediately by "Pack_Items," not "Validate_Payment." The sequence is: `Receive_Order` -> `Pack_Items`.
2.  In **CaseID C004**, the activity "Receive_Order" is followed immediately by "Check_Fraud," not "Validate_Payment." The sequence is: `Receive_Order` -> `Check_Fraud`.
