I need to identify the three worst-performing activities based on average waiting time. Let’s see the data:

- Request_Documents: 36.5
- Send_Closure_Letter: 12.2
- Assess_Liability: 7.8
- Approve_Payment: 3.2
- Initial_Screening: 2.1
- Fraud_Check: 0.9
- Reject_Claim: 0.6
- Submit_Claim: 0.4

The top three are Request_Documents, Send_Closure_Letter, and Assess_Liability. I need to recommend concrete, data-driven actions for each that could reduce waiting times by at least 20%. Each memo entry should be ≤50 words.

To cut down waiting times by at least 20%, I'll use the formula P95 * 0.8. Here’s the breakdown:

- For Request_Documents: target would be 120.0 * 0.8 = 96 h.
- Send_Closure_Letter: 44.0 * 0.8 = 35.2 h.
- Assess_Liability: 16.4 * 0.8 = 13.12 h.

Now, I need to create a concise executive memo under 150 words. It should detail these three activities with their metrics and actionable targets. I'll aim for clear headings and bullet points to keep it crisp and to the point!

Since I'm asked to draft a memo, I’ll format it as a brief message to the COO with short bullet points. It's important to avoid unnecessary small talk, and I'll make sure to include the relevant numbers precisely, without extra disclaimers. Here’s the final memo:

Subject: Claim Process Waiting-Time Reduction
Key focus: Request_Documents (avg 36.5h, 95th percentile 120h), Send_Closure_Letter (12.2h, 44h), and Assess_Liability (7.8h, 16.4h). I’ll recommend clear actions based on these metrics!

I'm preparing to create a memo that includes actionable recommendations for reducing waiting times. Here are the three actions I’ll detail:

1. For Request_Documents: "Introduce an auto reminders policy, with nudges on Day 3 and Day 7. A 20% reduction would lower the 95th percentile to ≤96h."

2. For Send_Closure_Letter: "Schedule daily batches triggered after payment approval, targeting a reduction to ≤35h."

3. For Assess_Liability: "Adopt a hybrid desk + field triage system with weighted criteria to cut the 95th percentile to ≤13.1h."

I'll ensure each point is data-driven and stays within the word limit!

I'm crafting an executive memo titled "Process Waiting-Time Priorities (Last 12 Months)." I’ll include the following details:

- Request_Documents: avg wait 36.5h, 95th percentile 120.0h. Action: implement automated reminders on Day 3 and Day 7 for incomplete submissions, targeting ≤96h for the 95th percentile.

- Send_Closure_Letter: avg wait 12.2h, 95th percentile 44.0h. Action: schedule daily batches triggered post-payment, aiming for ≤35.2h.

- Assess_Liability: avg wait 7.8h, 95th percentile 16.4h. Action: adopt a desk-first triage approach, targeting ≤13.1h for the 95th percentile.

Each point will help ensure we meet our objectives without discussing unnecessary metrics.

### Executive Memo: Waiting-Time Priorities

Subject: Reduce waiting time in three activities by ≥20%  
Top waiting bottlenecks (last 12 months):

1) Request_Documents — Avg waiting: 36.5 h; 95p: 120.0 h  
Action: Implement automated reminders at Day 3 and Day 7; use checklist-to-verify step to reduce incomplete submissions. Target P95 ≤ 96 h.

2) Send_Closure_Letter — Avg waiting: 12.2 h; 95p: 44.0 h  
Action: Run daily batch trigger after payment approval with guardrails on send timing; confirm linkage to document completion. Target P95 ≤ 35.2 h.

3) Assess_Liability — Avg waiting: 7.8 h; 95p: 16.4 h  
Action: Introduce desk-first triage with weighted criteria (loss type, claim value), escalating only when desk-only resolve fails. Target P95 ≤ 13.1 h.
