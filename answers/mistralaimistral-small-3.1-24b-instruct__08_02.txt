**Question 1.** Yes, transition **T5** can fire before transition **T3**.

**Question 2.** A minimal firing sequence is: **T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T1 → T5**.

In this sequence, **T1** is fired twice to provide the necessary tokens. The first firing of **T1** enables **T2** and **T7**, which produce a token in **P4**. Then **T4** fires, placing a token in **P5**. The second firing of **T1** provides an additional token in **P2**, allowing **T5** to fire before **T3**.
