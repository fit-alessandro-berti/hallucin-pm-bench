**Non-compliant**

Justification:
1. **Rule 1 violation**:
   - The PO amount (€12 300) exceeds €10 000, requiring **two approvals** (`Approve_PO` by *Procurement_Officer* followed by `Approve_PO_CFO` by *CFO*) **before** `Issue_PO`.
   - While both approvals are present (events #2 and #3), `Expedite_Flag` (event #4) occurs **after** `Approve_PO_CFO` but **before** `Issue_PO`. This does not violate Rule 1 directly, but the sequence of approvals is correct. *No violation here upon re-examination* (correction: initial assessment was incorrect; approvals are properly ordered before `Issue_PO`).

2. **Rule 2 violation**:
   - The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), making `Quality_Check` optional but mandating that `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before the first `Ship_Goods`**.
   - `Ship_Goods` (event #8) occurs **before** `Risk_Assessment` (event #9), violating the ordering constraint.

3. **Rule 3 violation**:
   - `Goods_Received` occurs at event #6. The next two activities are:
     - #7: `Move_to_Quality` (Intern)
     - #8: `Ship_Goods` (Logistics)
   - `Three_way_match` (event #10) occurs **3 activities after** `Goods_Received` (distance = 4, not ≤ 2), violating the timeliness requirement.

4. **Rule 4 violation**:
   - Event #3 (`Approve_PO_CFO`) is executed by the **CFO**, and the **next activity** (event #4: `Expedite_Flag`) is performed by the **System** (not an Intern), so this does not violate Rule 4.
   - However, event #7 (`Move_to_Quality`) is executed by an **Intern** and **directly follows** event #6 (`Goods_Received` by *Warehouse_Clerk*), which is unrelated to the CFO. *No violation here* (correction: initial assessment misapplied the rule).

5. **Rule 5 compliance**:
   - The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event #11) and contains no subsequent activities. **Compliant**.

---
**Summary of Violations**:
- **Rule 2**: `Risk_Assessment` occurs after `Ship_Goods`.
- **Rule 3**: `Three_way_match` is not completed within 2 activities of `Goods_Received`.

**Final Answer**: **Non-compliant**.
