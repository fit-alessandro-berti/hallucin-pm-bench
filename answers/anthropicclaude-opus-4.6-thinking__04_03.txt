## **No — the trace is NOT compliant.**

---

### Trace (with positions for reference):

| # | Activity |
|---|----------|
| 1 | create_case |
| 2 | capture_event_details |
| 3 | Quality_Engineer_Review (QE) |
| 4 | **Notify_Authorities (NA)** |
| 5 | Regulatory_Affairs_Review (RA) |
| 6 | VP_Safety_Approval (VP) |
| 7 | Close_Case (CC) |

---

### Rule-by-Rule Analysis

**Rule 1 (QE before RA, each exactly once):** ✅ **Satisfied**
QE occurs once at position 3 and RA occurs once at position 5. QE precedes RA.

**Rule 2 (VP after both QE and RA when severity = "High"):** ✅ **Satisfied**
Severity is "High," so VP is required. VP (position 6) occurs after both QE (position 3) and RA (position 5).

**Rule 3 (NA must not occur until after both QE and RA):** ❌ **VIOLATED**
Notify_Authorities occurs at position 4, **before** Regulatory_Affairs_Review at position 5. NA requires both QE *and* RA to be complete first, but RA had not yet occurred when NA was executed.

**Rule 4 (CC only after NA, and after VP if required):** ✅ **Satisfied**
Close_Case (position 7) occurs after both NA (position 4) and VP (position 6).

### Summary
The trace violates **Rule 3**: `Notify_Authorities` was performed prematurely — after only `Quality_Engineer_Review` but **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` was completed. Authorities were notified without the full review chain being finished, which is a clear process-compliance breach.
