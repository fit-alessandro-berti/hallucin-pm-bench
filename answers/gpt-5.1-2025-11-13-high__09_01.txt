1) The average cycle time of “Review Contract” **cannot be derived from the data provided.**

2) Explanation:  
To compute an average cycle time for an activity, we need start and end timestamps (or explicit duration values) for each occurrence of that activity, so we can calculate:

\[
\text{Activity duration per case} = \text{end time} - \text{start time}
\]
\[
\text{Average cycle time} = \frac{\sum \text{durations over all cases}}{\text{number of cases with that activity}}
\]

In the snippet you provided, all timestamp and elapsed-time fields have been redacted, and no duration benchmark is given for “Review Contract.” The historical benchmarks listed are only for “Receive Renewal Request,” “Negotiate Terms,” and “Legal Sign-off,” and for a different customer segment, so they cannot be used to infer the duration of “Review Contract.”

Therefore, the requested average cycle time for “Review Contract” cannot be computed from the available information.
