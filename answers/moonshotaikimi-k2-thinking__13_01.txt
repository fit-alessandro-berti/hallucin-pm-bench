**1.** 1  
**2.** 5.56 %  
**3.** A1002  
**4.** Two sampling‑related reasons why a monthly estimate based only on this fragment is unreliable:  

* **Small sample size** – The fragment contains only 18 events, which is insufficient to capture the variability of a low‑frequency activity like *Manual_Fraud_Check*; the resulting proportion has a very large margin of error.  
* **Non‑representative temporal coverage** – All events are from a single day (2025‑05‑01), so the sample is not random across the month and may be biased by day‑of‑week effects, special promotions, or other temporal factors that affect fraud‑check rates.
