Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Concrete Firing Sequence:**

1.  **Firing T1:** places p0 (1) → p1 (1)  p2 (1)
The marking becomes: p1(1) p2(1)
2.  **Firing T5:** places p1(1) p2(1), and p4 has *zero* tokens so the inhibitor arc is not an issue.  p1(1) → p6(1)
The marking becomes:  p2(1) p6(1)
3.  **Firing T3:**  places p3(0) p4(0), p2(1) → p4(1)
The marking becomes: p4(1) p6(1).

**Justification:** After firing T1, places p1 and p2 each have one token. Then T5 can fire right away as p4 can have zero tokens before T3 can fire.  After T5, T3 can fire.
