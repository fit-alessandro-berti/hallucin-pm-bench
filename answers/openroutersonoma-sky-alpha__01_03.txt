### a) Decision Points in Acme’s Process

The process contains two explicit decision points (one conditional branch and one approval gate), summarized below with their rules in one sentence each:

1. **Post-Tri-Color-Risk-Check Conditional Branch**: If the risk rating from the Tri-Color-Risk-Check is Low or Medium *and* the requested loan amount is €250,000 or less, then step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review) is skipped; otherwise, step 5 is performed.

2. **TriVote Decision Gate**: The process advances to step 7 (Prepare-Binding-Offer) only if at least any two out of the three required approvals (from the Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer) are obtained.
