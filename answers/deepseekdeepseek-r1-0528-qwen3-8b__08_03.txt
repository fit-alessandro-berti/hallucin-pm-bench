Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. Below, a shortest firing sequence is provided that demonstrates this, where T5 is fired and T3 has not been enabled or fired at any point before T5's firing.

### Shortest Firing Sequence:
- Initial marking: p0 = 1 (all other places = 0)
- Sequence: T1, T4, T2b, T5

This sequence can be broken down as follows:

1. **Fire T1**:  
   - Input: p0 (has token; fire T1)  
   - Output: produce tokens in places pa and pb.  
   - New marking: p0 = 0, pa = 1, pb = 1, pc = 0, pd = 0, pe = 0, pf = 0.

2. **Fire T4**:  
   - Input: pb (has token; fire T4)  
   - Output: consume pb, produce pe.  
   - New marking: p0 = 0, pa = 1, pb = 0, pe = 1.  
   - (Transition T3 is not enabled, as pc is not marked.)

3. **Fire T2b**:  
   - Input: pa (has token; fire T2b)  
   - Output: consume pa, produce pd.  
   - New marking: p0 = 0, pa = 0, pd = 1, pe = 1.  
   - (Transition T3 is still not enabled, as pc is not marked.)

4. **Fire T5**:  
   - Input: pd (has token) and pe (has token; both present so T5 is enabled)  
   - Output: consume pd and pe, produce pf.  
   - New marking: p0 = 0, pd = 0, pe = 0, pf = 1.  
   - (Transition T3 has not been enabled or fired, as no pc marking exists to enable it.)

In this sequence, T5 is fired fourth, and T3 never becomes enabled, so T5 fires before T3 in the sense that T3 has not been executed or even enabled by the time T5 is fired.

### Explanation of Why This Sequence Works:
- T5 requires inputs from pd and pe, which are produced by transitions T2b and T4, respectively.
- pa and pb, which are consumed by these transitions, are produced by T1 (the only transition that can be fired initially).
- Firing T4 first produces pe but leaves pa available; then firing T2b produces pd. This avoids enabling T3 (which requires pc) and allows T5 to be enabled if both pd and pe are marked.
- Since T3 is not needed for enabling or firing T5, it remains disabled by not producing any pc, and thus T5 can fire without T3 being involved.

This sequence is of minimal length, requiring four transitions to fire T5 when produced directly from T2b and T4, and T3 does not interfere.
