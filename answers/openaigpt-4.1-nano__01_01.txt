Certainly! Here's a summary of all **decision points** and **required documents** in Contoso Airlines’ flight-refund process:

---

### **Decision Points**

1. **Eligibility Verification**  
   - **Location:** After *Customer_Submit_Claim* and during *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*  
   - **Decision:** Does the claim meet the eligibility criteria based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?  
   - **Outcome:** If not eligible, the process likely terminates or requires further review (not specified). If eligible, proceed to pre-approval.

2. **Pre-Approval by Finance**  
   - **Location:** *Finance_Controller_PreApprove*  
   - **Decision:** Does the *EligibilityChecklist* indicate the claim qualifies for refund?  
   - **Outcome:** If not approved, the claim is denied or returned for additional information.

3. **High-Value Refund Approval**  
   - **Location:** After *Finance_Controller_PreApprove* — if refund amount > €1,000  
   - **Decision:** Is a review by *Senior_Auditor_Review* necessary?  
   - **Outcome:** For refunds > €1,000, approval depends on successful completion of *Senior_Auditor_Review* including the *AuditTrail*. If not approved, refund process halts.

4. **Payment Authorization**  
   - **Location:** *Process_Refund_Payment* activity  
   - **Decision:** Has the *BankTransferAuthorization* been obtained?  
   - **Outcome:** Payment proceeds only if authorized.
