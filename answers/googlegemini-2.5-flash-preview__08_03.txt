**Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

Here is one shortest firing sequence to achieve this:

```
T1 T2b T4 T5
```

**Explanation of the firing sequence:**

1. **T1:** Fires, consuming the token from `p0` and placing tokens in `pa` and `pb`.
   Marking: {pa=1, pb=1}
2. **T2b:** Fires, consuming the token from `pa` and placing a token in `pd`.
   Marking: {pb=1, pd=1}
3. **T4:** Fires, consuming the token from `pb` and placing a token in `pe`.
   Marking: {pd=1, pe=1}
4. **T5:** Fires, consuming tokens from `pd` and `pe` and placing a token in `pf`.
   Marking: {pf=1}

In this sequence, T5 fires after T2b and T4 fire, but without T3 ever firing. A token was routed to `pd` via the `T2b` transition, which bypasses the need for `T3` to provide a token to `pd`.
