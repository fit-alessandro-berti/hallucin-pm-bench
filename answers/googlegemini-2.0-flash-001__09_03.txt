I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity. The provided event log stub contains only the column names and no actual event data. Without the 'start_time' and 'complete_time' values for each instance of the "Approve Invoice" activity within each case, it is impossible to calculate the duration of this activity, which is required to compute the requested statistics.
