Unified diff addition: add a **clear policy validation** within *Task_PrepareContract* to ensure data completeness before contract world activation.  
Thus, the process now closes this SLA breach by enforcing mandatory input validation prior contract execution.

Rationale: This targeted refinement directly addresses the root cause of late contract preparations without introducing additional ambiguity or enhancing timelines unnecessarily.
