**Subject: Top 3 Process Performance Issues & Actionable Recommendations**

Based on combined SLA breaches and high waiting times, the three worst-performing activities are:

1. **Legal Approval**: Avg. throughput time (900s) exceeds SLA by 300 seconds, with 600s of waiting time.
2. **Risk Review**: Avg. throughput time (600s) exceeds SLA by 300 seconds, with 480s of waiting time.
3. **Credit Assessment**: Avg. throughput time (300s) exceeds SLA by 60 seconds, with 200s of waiting time.

Recommendations to address these gaps:
- **Legal Approval**: Reduce waiting time by automating document verification or reallocating legal resources to match SLA.
- **Risk Review**: Parallelize review tasks or implement a tiered risk model to reduce throughput time.
- **Credit Assessment**: Leverage pre-approval algorithms to cut processing time and waiting time by 30% (target: 150s throughput).

Latency in these stages impacts end-to-end efficiencyâ€”prioritize for pipeline optimization. Data suggests high throughput correlates with long wait times, indicating bottlenecks.
