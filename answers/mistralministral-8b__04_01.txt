Non-compliant. The trace does not respect rule 3.

**Justification:**

- Rule 3 states that after `Goods_Received`, activity `Three_way_match` must be completed within the next two activities (distance â‰¤ 2).
- In the trace, `Three_way_match` is executed at 2025-05-06 11:52, which is 17 minutes after `Goods_Received` (2025-05-06 08:44).
- This exceeds the allowed distance of 2 activities, making the trace non-compliant with rule 3.
