Below is the RACI table for the process described in the informal description. I have strictly adhered to the mandated vocabulary: "KYC Review" for customer due diligence activities, "Regulatory Liaison" for compliance-related roles, and "Transaction Analyst" for payment processing roles. The table covers every task from the source text, rephrased to align with the enforced terms.

The tasks have been extracted and clarified based on the description, ensuring completeness:

1. Transaction Analyst receives the customer’s transfer instruction and logs it in the system.
2. Transaction Analyst screens the payment against the sanctions list.
3. Regulatory Liaison performs the KYC Review on both sender and beneficiary.
4. If the transaction is flagged as high-risk, Regulatory Liaison approves it.
5. Transaction Analyst releases the payment.
6. IT Support ensures the SWIFT message is sent.
7. IT Support archives the case file; Regulatory Liaison is notified.

The RACI table is organized as follows:
- **Responsible**: The role that performs the task.
- **Accountable**: The role ultimately answerable for the task's success.
- **Consulted**: Roles that provide input or approval as needed.
- **Informed**: Roles that are kept aware of the task's outcome.
