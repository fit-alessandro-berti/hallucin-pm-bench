Answer: **YES**

Shortest firing sequence in which T5 fires before T3:

`T1  T2b  T4  T5`

Explanation (concise):

- After T1 fires, pa and pb each receive one token.
- Firing T2b (shortcut) immediately puts a token in pd without ever enabling T3.
- Firing T4 moves the token from pb to pe.
- Now T5 is enabled (it needs one token in pd and one in pe), so it can fire before T3 has any chance to fire.
