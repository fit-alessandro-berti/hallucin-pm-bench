Based solely on Process B â€“ Warehouse_Replenishment, the sets of tasks that can execute concurrently (i.e., tasks on different branches of the same parallel construct) are numbered and listed in order of appearance:

1. **Quality_Check** and **Update_Inventory** (from Parallel Split #1)  
2. **Generate_Replenishment_Report** and **Notify_Procurement** (from Parallel Split #2)  

These represent the two distinct parallel segments within the process.
