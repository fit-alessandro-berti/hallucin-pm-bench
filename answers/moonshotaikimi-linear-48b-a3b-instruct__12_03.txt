**Answer:** No

**Justification:**

1. **Case C002**  
   - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T09:30:00  
   - Pack_Items at 2025-01-03T09:50:00 → Activity that should have occurred after Receive_Order is **Pack_Items**, not Validate_Payment.  
   ⇒ “Validate_Payment does **not** always follow Receive_Order”

2. **Case C004**  
   - Receive_Order at 2025-01-03T10:05:00  
   - Check_Fraud at 2025-01-03T10:07:00, followed by Validate_Payment at 2025-01-03T10:20:00 → Validate_Payment occurs after Check_Fraud.  
   ⇒ Again, Validate_Payment does **not** occur immediately after Receive_Order.

Therefore, the FACT is **not** accurate.
