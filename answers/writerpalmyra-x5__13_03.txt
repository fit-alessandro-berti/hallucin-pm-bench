1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1 time** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the prevalence of manual fraud checks because the sample is small and may not reflect overall process behavior. With just three cases, the frequency of "Manual Fraud Check" could appear significant or negligible depending on extrapolation. Additionally, the snippet may not capture system-wide triggers (e.g., threshold-based routing to manual review) or volume patterns across time, leading to biased assumptions about how often manual checks occur in the full March 2025 log.
