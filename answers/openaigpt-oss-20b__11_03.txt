MEMORANDUM  

To: Orion COO  
From: Senior Process‑Performance Analyst  
Date: 5 Aug 2025  
Subject: Top Activity Bottlenecks – SLA Breaches & Waiting Times  

The data show that **Legal Approval**, **Risk Review**, and **Credit Assessment** are the three activities with the highest combined impact on SLA breaches and prolonged waiting times.  

* **Legal Approval** exceeds its SLA by **300 s** and averages **600 s** of waiting.  
* **Risk Review** also exceeds its SLA by **300 s** while waiting averages **480 s**.  
* **Credit Assessment** exceeds its SLA by **60 s** with an average waiting time of **200 s**.  

**Recommendations**  
- Deploy automated document‑verification workflows for Legal Approval to cut waiting time by at least 30 % (target: ≤ 420 s).  
- Introduce an interim risk‑triage step for Risk Review to reduce waiting time by 35 % (target: ≤ 310 s).  
- Adopt a predictive scoring engine for Credit Assessment to lower throughput time by 20 % (target: ≤ 240 s) and waiting time by 50 % (target: ≤ 100 s).
