**Answer 1.** No, it is not possible for **T5** to fire before **T3** in any reachable marking.

**Explanation.** For **T5** to fire, both **P2** and **P5** must be marked. **P2** is only filled by **T1**, and **T3** consumes **P2** to produce **P4**, which is required to eventually produce **P5** via **T4**. Therefore, **T3** must fire at least once before **T5** can fire, as **T5** depends on the firing of **T3** (via **P4 → P5**). Thus, **T5** cannot precede **T3** in any firing sequence. ✅
