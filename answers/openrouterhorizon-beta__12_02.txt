No. In case C003, Validate_Payment occurs before Receive_Order (lines 6 then 7), so it does not always follow. Also, in case C005, Validate_Payment (line 11) is not followed by Receive_Order at all (next is Cancel_Order on line 12). While C001 (lines 1–2), C002 (lines 3–5), and C004 (lines 8–10) do have Validate_Payment after Receive_Order, the counterexamples C003 and C005 invalidate the “always follows” claim.
