## MEMORANDUM

**TO:** COO, Acme Insurance
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2025
**SUBJECT:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance â€“ Urgent Attention Required

This memo highlights key performance issues within the Claims Handling process based on Q1-2025 data. Three activities require immediate attention: **Request Documents**, **Review Documents**, and **Initial Assessment**.

**Request Documents** is the worst performer, exhibiting a significantly high average wait time (150 minutes) combined with a substantial rework rate (22.0%). *Action:* Investigate the root cause of frequent rework; potentially implement automated validation checks at the request stage.

**Review Documents** also suffers from high wait times (30 minutes) and a notably high rework rate (5.3%), alongside a considerable SLA breach rate (12.4%). *Action:* Analyze cases requiring rework to identify common issues and implement targeted training for claims reviewers. 

**Initial Assessment** demonstrates a high average wait time (18 minutes) and a concerning SLA breach rate (3.2%). While processing time is acceptable, the delay impacts overall cycle time. *Action:* Explore options for triaging claims more effectively upon arrival to reduce initial queueing. 

Addressing these bottlenecks will yield significant gains in customer satisfaction and process efficiency.
