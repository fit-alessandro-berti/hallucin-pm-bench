We are given two BPMN XML versions. For BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2. We must provide summary changes in exactly three headings: "Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway-type changes", and we must not show cosmetic renamings or reordering lines, only structural changes.

Let check BPMN v1:
Items:
- startEvent: id StartEvent_1, name "Start"
- task: id Task_ReviewApplication, name "Review Application" 
- exclusiveGateway: id Gateway_Decision, name "Eligible?"
- task: id Task_ApproveLoan, name "Approve Loan" 
- task: id Task_RejectLoan, name "Reject Loan" 
- endEvent: id EndEvent_1, name "End"
Sequences:
Flow from Start -> Task_ReviewApplication
Flow: Task_ReviewApplication -> Gateway_Decision
Flow: Gateway_Decision -> Task_ApproveLoan with name "yes"
Flow: Gateway_Decision -> Task_RejectLoan with name "no"
Flow: Task_ApproveLoan -> EndEvent_1
Flow: Task_RejectLoan -> EndEvent_1

Now BPMN v2:
Items:
- startEvent: id StartEvent_1, name "Start" (same id, names remain same not matter? Actually not, but we are told "ignore cosmetic renamings" so no changes output if just renaming.)
- task: id Task_VerifyIdentity, name "Verify Identity" 
- task: id Task_ReviewApplication, name "Review Application" (same id as in BPMN v1, though naming is same? But "Review Application" is present in both. But BPMN v2 has this Task with same id as BPMN_v1, then BPMN_v1 had an exclusive gateway, but now BPMN_v2 uses also new tasks:)
- inclusiveGateway: id Gateway_Decision, name "Eligibility Check"
- task: id Task_ApproveLoan, name "Auto-Approve Loan"
- task: id Task_RequestDocs, name "Request Additional Documents"
- task: id Task_FinalReject, name "Final Reject"
- endEvent: id EndEvent_1, name "End"

Now strictly analyze differences:
Heads:
- Compare tasks: We have tasks in BPMN v1 and BPMN v2
Comparing tasks by id maybe or by name?
Question says: "summaize every change strictly under headings Added tasks, Removed tasks, and Gateway-type changes". We must check differences in gateway types (e.g., BPMN v1 had an Exclusive gateway "Gateway_Decision" while BPMN v2 has an Inclusive gateway "Gateway_Decision"? Actually BPMN_v2 xml says inclusiveGateway  id="Gateway_Decision", name "Eligibility Check". That is a gateway type change. But BPMN_v1 says exclusiveGateway id "Gateway_Decision", name "Eligible?" So same id but different gatewat type. There is no task "Gateway_Decision" id change, but its property is changed from exclusive to inclusive (managed with new type tag).
- In BPMN.v1, tasks: Review Application; Approve Loan; Reject Loan.
In BPMN.v2, tasks: 
- Task_ReviewApplication present in both v2 and v1. So no difference (task exists in both shapes, though maybe could be considered as "renamed", but not because its name is the same "Review Application"? But BPMN protected, but we ignore cosmetic renamings. Actually note: BPMN v1: Task id Task_ReviewApplication appear. BPMN v2: Task id Task_ReviewApplication also appear; so no difference.)
- BPMN_v2 added tasks: Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject are new? Well, check BPMN_v2: "Task_VerifyIdentity", "Task_RequestDocs", "Task_FinalReject" are not in v1.
Then BPMN_v1 had tasks: Task_ApproveLoan, Task_RejectLoan which are no longer in BPMN_v2? But BPMN v2 has tasks: Task_ApproveLoan and Task_FinalReject. However careful: v2 still has a task for approve loan? Yes: BPMN v2: <task id="Task_ApproveLoan" name="Auto-Approve Loan"/> which is not same as BPMN_v1: Task_ApproveLoan name "Approve Loan"? We are told ignore cosmetic renamings. So that same id is present in both? Actually, BPMN v2: <task id="Task_ApproveLoan", name "Auto-Approve Loan". BPMN v1: <task id="Task_ApproveLoan", name "Approve Loan". Only names have changed. But we ignore cosmetic renamings. However, BPMN v2 differs from BPMN v1 that it has extra tasks added: we identify new tasks: Task_ApproveLoan? Actually, let's check. BPMN v1 tasks:
    Task_ReviewApplication (exists in both)
    Task_ApproveLoan (both have id: Task_ApproveLoan, but name changed? but as said, ignore cosmetic renamings, so same id Task_ApproveLoan is there).
    Task_RejectLoan (exists in BPMN v1)
Then BPMN v2 tasks:
    Task_VerifyIdentity (new)
    Task_ReviewApplication (same id, so no change)
    Task_ApproveLoan (same id as BPMN v1 though name changed; ignore cosmetic renamings, so no difference)
    Task_RequestDocs (new)
    Task_FinalReject (new) (and BPMN v2 no longer has Task_RejectLoan.)
BPMN v2 does not mention the "Task_RejectLoan". So that is removed.

Thus Added tasks include: Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, Task_FinalReject. Also possibly Task_FinalReject is addition instead of Task_RejectLoan. But then removed tasks: Removed tasks include: Task_RejectLoan, i.e. removed? Although check: BPMN v1: Task_RejectLoan, BPMN v2: replaced by Task_FinalReject so that is a removal (complete removal from BPMN_v1, not retained in BPMN_v2).

Gateway changes: BPMN_v1 places exclusiveGateway with id "Gateway_Decision", BPMN_v2 now uses an inclusiveGateway with id "Gateway_Decision", so that's a type change: from exclusive to inclusive.

Other changes: For flows, there are that BPMN_v2 has an extra sequenceFlow "Flow_1" and "Flow_2" maybe that are not equivalent to BPMN_v1 flows? But the question says we are only summarizing changes under added tasks, removed tasks, and gateway-type changes. And note instructions "Ignore cosmetic renamings or reordered XML lines." So flows are cosmetic maybe? But wait not flows. The instructions: "Compare BPMN xml versions, and summarise all changes (grouped strictly under the exactly requested headings): Added tasks, Removed tasks, Gateway-type changes, ignoring cosmetic renamings or reordered lines." Provided directions: "Ignore cosmetic renamings or reordered XML lines." So flows might be considered cosmetic differences too? But wait the instructions don't say "ignore flows." But instructions only mentions to summarise changes, grouping them under exactly three headings, and they only list changes that are tasks changes and gateway-type changes. So we don't consider flow changes maybe? Check instructions: 
The instructions say: "Summarise every change strictly under the three requested headings." So we only need to output under three headings, not mention changes like changes in sequence flows flows details? That means we are to consider BPMN tasks differences (added or removed tasks) and gateway type changes. So we will not mention the changes in sequence flows as instructions says "Ignore cosmetic renamings or reordered XML lines." Still, XML lines reordering doesn't matter but sequence flow changes might be structural. But question says "changes to the overall flow, including tasks and gateways?" But instructions explicitly "Ignore cosmetic renamings or reordered XML lines." But then not further instructions mention flows? Specifics given: "Summarise all changes, grouped under exactly these headings." The headings are: "Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway-type changes". They didn't ask for flows changes. But should we consider that new flows are differences? They said "Compare two BPMN XML versions of Acme Bank’s Loan_Process that follow. Summarise all changes, grouped under exactly these headings: Added tasks, Removed tasks, Gateway-type changes" The instructions want us to ignore cosmetic changes. So we do not mention flow changes because flows are not required in the headings, so we only list what's added tasks and what's removed tasks and gateway changes. So that's our answer. But let's check if any gateways changes: BPMN v1 had an exclusiveGateway, BPMN v2 used an inclusiveGateway with same id "Gateway_Decision". That is a gateway-type change. That would be "Exclusive gateway has been changed to an inclusive gateway." Additionally, check if any gateway changes like additions or removals? BPMN v1 : one gateway is used, BPMN v2 with same id so no addition or removal, only type difference.

Now, tasks: Count them. BPMN_v1 tasks:
- Task_ReviewApplication (exists in v1 and v2) so ignore.
- Task_ApproveLoan (exists in v1 and v2, though name changed but we ignore renamings)
- Task_RejectLoan (only in BPMN_v1, absent in BPMN_v2).

BPMN_v2 tasks:
- Task_VerifyIdentity (present only in BPMN_v2, so it's added)
- Task_RequestDocs (present only in BPMN_v2, so it's added)
- Task_FinalReject (present only in BPMN_v2), note that BPMN_v2 now doesn't contain Task_RejectLoan; BPMN_v2 is missing the Task_RejectLoan so Task_FinalReject might be a new branch of rejection not only a renaming? But wait, earlier BPMN v2: More detailed flows: 
Flow: 
   Flow_1: StartEvent -> Task_VerifyIdentity (added new step)
   Flow_2: Task_VerifyIdentity -> Task_ReviewApplication (new flow so added new linking between identity check & application review)
   Flow_3: Task_ReviewApplication -> Gateway_Decision (same as BPMN v1)
   Flow_4: Gateway_Decision -> Task_ApproveLoan with name "eligible" (change name from "yes" but it's the same connection conceptually)
   Flow_5: Gateway_Decision -> Task_RequestDocs with name "missing docs"
   Flow_6: Gateway_Decision -> Task_FinalReject with name "ineligible"
   Flow_7: Task_ApproveLoan -> EndEvent
   Flow_8: Task_RequestDocs -> EndEvent
   Flow_9: Task_FinalReject -> EndEvent

 So the question does not ask us to mention the changes to sequence flows (except possibly achieve explicit changes in tasks?). The headings only include tasks and gateway type changes. So changes "removed tasks" includes BPMN v1 task "Task_RejectLoan" not present in BPMN_v2. And added tasks include BPMN_v2 tasks Task_VerifyIdentity, Task_RequestDocs, and Task_FinalReject. In addition, there are changes in flows, but we are not asked to list that. Instruction explicitly "Cosmetic renamings and reordered lines ignore" which might not include structural differences between flows? Actually probably not.

I want to be careful, but question text says "Ignore cosmetic renamings or reordered XML lines." But then also excluded other details? It might be saying that if there's a cosmetic renaming like "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan", we must treat that as not changed.
Additionally, check additional difference: The gateway "Eligible?" in v1 with name has been renamed to "Eligibility Check" in v2. But that is a cosmetic change? However, that might also be considered gateway type. The name "Eligible?" changed, but it's not asked to be summarised separately because question only requires us to summarise gateway-type changes. But also check: Gateway type is changed from exclusive to inclusive. But the name also changed. But who are we allowed to ignore windows usually "cosmetic renamings"? So only report gateway type changes. So output must mention that gateway type has changed from exclusive to inclusive. And also note that some flows remain identical if ignoring renamings - but not required to mention flows.

Consider possible further tasks: The BPMN version v1 seems to have a sequence Flow "Flow_2" different?
Wait some tasks? Actually, let's cross-check tasks with id exactly. I need to list changes in tasks with their ids. In BPMN_v1:
*Task id "Task_VerifyIdentity": not existing, but in BPMN_v2 it is new, so that's obviously changed: "Added task: Task_VerifyIdentity"
*Then BPMN_v1 also had "Task_ReviewApplication", BPMN_v2 includes that same id. So not mention changes? But note BPMN v2 then renames "Approve Loan" to "Auto-Approve Loan", but we ignore that.
* Task id "Task_ApproveLoan" in BPMN_v1 and BPMN_v2 (Even though name changed, it's the same id so considered same task.)

* BPMN_v1 had task "Task_RejectLoan", but BPMN_v2 does not have it. Instead BPMN_v2 has a new task "Task_FinalReject" to replace it.
* BPMN_v2 added a task with id "Task_RequestDocs" and name "Request Additional Documents". So this is clearly added task.

* The gateway changed type. BPMN_v1 has "exclusiveGateway" and BPMN_v2 has "inclusiveGateway", so there is a gateway-type change for the same id "Gateway_Decision".

Also check flows: This logic flows summary: In BPMN_v1, only one gateway path exists: from review application to gateway to approve loan if eligible and to reject loan if not eligible. In BPMN_v2, additional path is added: new initial step Task_VerifyIdentity, then flow to review application, then new flows from previous exclusivity is replaced by inclusive gateway with three outgoing flows: eligible, missing docs, ineligible. But we ignore these details because they are not tasks changes and not gateway-type changes (well the gateway-type is one change to mention, but if we mention flows? But question says "'added tasks', 'removed tasks', and 'gateway-type changes'." We are mandated to only mention these three categories; therefore flows differences are cosmetic changes? However, note that in BPMN_v2 there is "Flow_9" with Task_FinalReject which is new compared to BPMN_v1's Flow_6 from Task_RejectLoan, but we ignore flow changes because our headings don't include flows.)

Now check textual details: "summarise every change strictly under the three headings". It asks to "group them exactly as these three headings", so our answer should have exactly three bullet points with headings: "Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway-type changes", each grouping changes. I could use bullet points for each group. I must list added tasks: which tasks are added? They are: Task_VerifyIdentity (added in BPMN_v2), Task_RequestDocs, and Task_FinalReject. But careful: We might think that Task_FinalReject is replacing Task_RejectLoan. But since BPMN_v1 had Task_RejectLoan, and BPMN_v2 has Task_FinalReject; that is not a renaming because it doesn't share the same id. So even though the process remains conceptually similar, it's a change - the original "Reject Loan" is renamed into "Final Reject"? But then the BPMN v2's new task "Task_FinalReject" is a new different task with a new id? Wait, check BPMN_v2: They have a task id "Task_FinalReject" with name "Final Reject". BPMN v1 had a task with id "Task_RejectLoan" with name "Reject Loan". They are different. So changes: Added tasks: "Task_VerifyIdentity", "Task_RequestDocs", "Task_FinalReject", and removed task: "Task_RejectLoan" is removed in BPMN_v2, replaced by Task_FinalReject. So that's it only.

As for gateway changes: BPMN_v1 had an exclusive gateway type, BPMN_v2 had an inclusive gateway type with the same id, meaning a change from exclusive to inclusive. So we list that.

Also check about renamings: BPMN_v1 "Review Application" remains exactly the same BPMN_v2 "Review Application"? Yes, it's the same in both. BPMN_v1 "Approve Loan" gets renamed "Auto-Approve Loan" but we ignore that because cosmetic. Also, BPMN_v1's gateway is renamed from "Eligible?" to "Eligibility Check" so we ignore that. The gateway's type though is the more important difference.

Therefore I produce final answer with headings:

Heading: "Added tasks"
- Task_VerifyIdentity: added
- Task_RequestDocs: added
- Task_FinalReject: added (instead of the old Task_RejectLoan, but we need to mention both addition and removal)
Then heading: "Removed tasks"
- Task_RejectLoan: removed.
Then heading: "Gateway-Type changes"
- The gateway originally exclusive (in BPMN_v1) was changed to inclusive (BPMN_v2).

Thus answer must be in text format. Must be complete and succinct and respect heading order strictly. The question says "grouped under exactly these headings: Added tasks, Removed tasks, Gateway-type changes." So give a list for each grouping separated by bullet points or lines, likely not number them but give bullet headings.

I'll produce text with headings "Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway-type changes". List out changes. Write answer without markdown formatting by default, but the user input has markdown formatting. But instructions "By default, do not reply with markdown formatting" but instructions say "System (background):... careful expand" but I should produce answer text as plain text? Steps: "No markdown formatting unless requested." But question said "use exactly three headings of: Added tasks, Removed tasks, and Gateway-type changes" with bullet points. But user used "#" with BPMN lines. I'll produce plain text answer with headings and bullet points.

I want to check that it's strictly three headings, each containing a bullet list within.

I'll produce final answer in text:

Answer:

Added tasks:
- Task_VerifyIdentity
- Task_RequestDocs
- Task_FinalReject

Removed tasks:
- Task_RejectLoan

Gateway type changes:
- Gateway_Decision changed from Exclusive Gateway to Inclusive Gateway type.

I'll produce answer precise answer.

Double-check if any tasks are added? Also check BPMN_v1 in BPMN_v2: Now in BPMN_v2, there's now two gateways? Wait, count again: BPMN_v2 only showed one gateway: "inclusiveGateway id Gateway_Decision" with name "Eligibility Check"; so indeed only one gateway remains. So nothing more.
Not sure if flows are also to be disregarded. So answer is done.

Wait check potential possible additional addition: In BPMN_v2, the cycle from Review Application: they have additional sequence flows to three different tasks from the gateway. But that is part of structural business change flows not captured by the headings. So not list them.

Okay answer seems succinct. I'll produce answer in plain text with correct bullet groups.

I'll produce answer with exact headings as required exactly "Added tasks", "Removed tasks", "Gateway-type changes", then list. I'll produce answer in plain text, listing bullet points in plain text. I'll produce final answer.Added tasks:
• Task_VerifyIdentity  
• Task_RequestDocs  
• Task_FinalReject  

Removed tasks:
• Task_RejectLoan  

Gateway-type changes:
• The gateway originally declared as an exclusive gateway has been replaced by an inclusive gateway (same id “Gateway_Decision”; note that the name changed from “Eligible?” to “Eligibility Check,” which is considered cosmetic).
