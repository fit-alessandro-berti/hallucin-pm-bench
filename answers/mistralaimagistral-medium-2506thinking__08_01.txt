# Summary

The answer is **yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. One such firing sequence is: T1, T2, T5.

### Concrete Firing Sequence and Justification:

1. **Initial Marking**: p0=1, others=0.

2. **Fire T1**: Consumes p0 and deposits one token in p1 and one in p2.
   - New marking: p1=1, p2=1, others=0.
   - Enabled transitions: T2, T3.

3. **Fire T2**: Consumes p1 and deposits one token in p3.
   - New marking: p2=1, p3=1, others=0.
   - Enabled transitions: T3, T5 (since p4=0 and p3=1).

4. **Fire T5**: Consumes p3 and deposits one token in p6 (p4=0 enables T5).
   - New marking: p2=1, p6=1, p3=0, others=0.
   - At this point, T3 is still enabled (p2=1), but T5 has already fired before T3 in this sequence.

Thus, the sequence where T5 fires before T3 is valid. Therefore, the answer is:

\boxed{Yes}

With a concrete firing sequence being:

\[ T1, T2, T5 \]

**Justification**:
After firing T1 and T2, the marking is such that both T5 and T3 are enabled. By choosing to fire T5 first, we ensure that T5 fires before T3 in that sequence.

### Final Answer:

It is possible for transition \(T5\) to fire before transition \(T3\). One such firing sequence is:

\[ T1, T2, T5, T3 \]

\[
\boxed{Yes}
