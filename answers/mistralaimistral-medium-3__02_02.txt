Let's analyze the XES event log fragment step by step to answer the questions.

### Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?
Looking at the `case` attribute in each event:
- C001 (lines 1, 3, 7)
- C002 (lines 2, 5, 8, 10)
- C003 (lines 4, 6, 9)

**Answer:** 3 distinct cases (C001, C002, C003).

### Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred.
Filtering events for `case="C002"` (lines 2, 5, 8, 10):
1. `Receive_Order` (line 2, timestamp: 2025-03-01T09:15:10)
2. `Check_Stock` (line 5, timestamp: 2025-03-01T09:22:55)
3. `Arrange_Delivery` (line 8, timestamp: 2025-03-01T10:15:20)
4. `Ship_Order` (line 10, timestamp: 2025-03-01T10:25:40)

**Answer:** `Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order`

---

### Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order”.
We need to find the activity that comes right before `Ship_Order` in each case.

1. For **C001** (line 7: `Ship_Order`):
   - Previous event is line 3: `Check_Stock`.
2. For **C002** (line 10: `Ship_Order`):
   - Previous event is line 8: `Arrange_Delivery`.
3. For **C003** (line 9: `Ship_Order`):
   - Previous event is line 6: `Check_Stock`.

Distinct preceding activities: `Check_Stock`, `Arrange_Delivery`.

**Answer (alphabetically ordered):**
```
Arrange_Delivery
Check_Stock
```
