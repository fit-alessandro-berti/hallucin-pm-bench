Based **only** on Process B (Manufacturing_WorkOrder), the pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel are:

```plaintext
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
```

### Explanation:
1. **Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines**: Step 2 explicitly states they "may run **simultaneously**" after Create_Work_Order.
2. **Create_Documentation and Quality_Check**: Step 4 states they begin "**in parallel**" right after Fabricate.

### Notes:
- Pairs are alphabetized *within* each line (e.g., "Create_Documentation" before "Quality_Check").
- The overall list is alphabetized by the first task in each pair ("C" before "P").
- No other parallel pairs exist in Process B, as all other tasks have explicit sequential dependencies.
