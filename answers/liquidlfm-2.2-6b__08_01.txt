**Answer:** Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Firing sequence:**

1. **Initial marking:**  
   p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)

2. **T1 fires:**  
   - p0 consumes its single token and places two tokens into p1 and p2 via T1.  
   - Now: p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), rest 0.

3. **T3 fires immediately (before T5):**  
   - p2(1) cannot fire directly (because it’s a normal arc, p3 and p4 must be formed first), but note: there's no requirement for T5 to fire *after* T3. The key is that **T5 is enabled only if p4 has zero tokens**, and at this point p4 = 0. However, p4 is currently 0, but T5 also has an inhibitor arc from p4 — but more importantly, T5 is disabled if p4 has **any** tokens. Here, right after T1, p4 is still 0, so **T5 is *enabled*** (even though p1 is active). There is no constraint stopping p5 from filling p3+p4 and then allowing p4 to become non-zero and subsequently inhibit T5. But here’s the actual path:

   Actually, T5 cannot fire **immediately** unless p4 is empty. After T1, p4 is still 0, so **T5 is enabled**. But T3 fires immediately after T1. However, let's correct the timing:

   - After T1 fires, p3 and p4 remain at 0.
   - p2 has 1 token, p1 has 1, but T3 is not active yet because:
     - To reach p3 and p4 jointly, one must wait for a stable (or "complete") input to both, but no transition requires both p3 and p4 to accumulate *the moment of single token arrival*.
     - The crucial point: **T5 is enabled (capable) as soon as p4 = 0 (which is true immediately after T1)**. However, T5 (normal arc) only fires when the inbound terminals have tokens **exactly as needed**, but p4 is not a terminal receiving token — it's a conductor to T5; no inbound on p4 — its outbound is to p6 and inhibits via p5 later.

   Clarification: **p4 has 0 initially after T1**, so **T5 is enabled**. But T5 requires p3+p4 to be **present as inputs**, but there's no mechanism forcing p4 to contain tokens *simultaneously* at p3+p4. However, there’s no priority rule; transitions with dependencies on *just one place* (p3 and p4 independently) would fire based on their input.

   Wait — re-read T5: line says:
   - T5: p3  –|p4 →  p6 is correct as written. The description: "(normal arc –|p4 means inhibitor arc from p4" — but here it says the **inhibitor arc is from p4**, i.e., **T5 is enabled only when p4 has zero tokens**. But also, T5 requires *two* concurrent points p3 and p4? Or is it per-state?

   Actually, T5 written is:
   - Normal arc: starts at p3, and has a **global inhibitor arc** labeled `–|p4`, meaning T5 is **blocked if p4 has any tokens**.

   But **p4 has 0 tokens** immediately after T1, so this handler disables the inhibitor path — but no restriction on **both** p3 and p4 simultaneously being available. However, T5 still requires **both p3 and p4 to have tokens** to fire, right?

   No — T5’s activation depends on having tokens in p3 and **p4**, but no inertia; it only needs p4=0.

   Actually, the describing arrow `–|p4` means: the inhibitor for T5 comes from p4, but likely `-|` indicates that **p4 must have exactly zero tokens to disable** the inhibitor — i.e., T5 is **enabled (allowed to proceed)** only when p4=0.

   But the key is: **before T3 can fire**, we have p2(1), p1(1), others 0, p4=0.

   Because p4=0, **T5 is Enabled**. But T5 requires **two inputs: p3 and p4**, but no **traffic** toward both. However, **T5 is a normal transition from p3, but requires p4 to be 0**, which it is, but still, **T5 must have p3 and p4 as current content**.

   But there’s no transition that adds to **both p3 and p4** at the same time. T3 fills p1 and p2, T1 fills p0 to create p2 and p1 — but not p3 and p4 together.

   Actually, to reach p5 (next state), both p3 and p4 must be filled; but T4 runs only when **both p3 and p4 are non-zero and arranged**, but no transition pleases both at once.

   The issue is: **T3 fires when p2 has at least 1 token, and p1 has 0? No — T3 is: p2 → p4; it just adds to p4 when p2 has tokens. So after T1, p2=1, p3=0, p1=1. Then T5: can T5 fire? It needs p3+p4 to have tokens — but p3=0 currently, and to need both, p4 must be filled *before* p3 can be counted for T4? No.

   Better: **define what must fire for T5 to *possibly* fire when valid conditions could create it**.

   Alternative: reread the Petri net description.

   Transition T5: p3 –|p4 → p6  
   Legend: “–|p4 means an inhibitor arc from p4” — this means that **the transition is blocked (inhibited) if placement p4 (the place designated by –|p4) has any tokens** — no, actually invariant: the presence of any token in p4 **inhibits T5**? But that doesn't affect the condition — it just blocks activation if p4 has tokens.

   But then the transition can still be **enabled** (i.e., internally processed) if p4=0, but still, to fire, both p3 and p4 must contain tokens? Or only p3 matters?

   Actually, T4 is: p3 + p4 → p5 — so when both p3 and p4 are non-zero, p3 transfers to p5, which then fills p4? No, T4 is: p3 and p4 together feed into p5? No: the description says “p3 + p4 → p5”, which is ambiguous — but standard is that the sum means TC + FC both provide tokens (or share), but in this case, it’s written as a place transition from both.

   Actually, **T4: p3 + p4 → p5** likely means: multiple sources — but likely it’s a placeholder or it means both p3 and p4 contribute? But units are unclear.

   Standard interpretation: **T4 is triggered by the combination of both p3 and p4 having tokens; both are used (or collectively), and p5 is the output** — but for this analysis, assume that **for both T3 and T5 to contribute to the output**, both p3 and p4 must have tokens.

   But T3 produces p4: T3: p2 → p4 (unit for p4). So when p2 fires, it adds to p4. After T1, p2=1, so p4 becomes 1. But p3 was 0, then after T1, p3=0.

   Now, is **T5 possible before T3**? We need p4=0 to enable T5 (from `–|p4` label), but **T5 also needs p3 to have tokens**. But p3 has already 1 from T1? No — T1 is p0→p1+p2: so p0 loses, p1 gains, p2 gains. So p3=0 after T1.

   No state change gives p3 both before p3 is consumed except possibly by other means, but no transition increases p3.

   So p3 has gone extinct after T1 (enter, no exit), p4 increased to 1.

   So p3=0, p4=1.

   So p4≠0, so T5 is blocked (inhibited) — no matter what.

   Then T5 **cannot** fire — because the inhibitor disconnects it.

   Therefore, **T5 cannot fire at any point** in any reachable marking, because its only enabling condition (p4=0) is **never true** after T1, and even after T1, p4=1.

   So in particular, **T5 cannot fire before T3** — impossible to even fire at all.

   But the user is asking specifically about T5 before T3.

   After T1, p2=1, but T2 is p1→p3, but p1=1, so T2 would fire, but p1 is separate.

   Wait — T3 is triggered by p2 having received a token. After T1, p2 had 1 token, and since it has ≥1, and no `direct` T3 trigger (no delay), T3 should fire.

   When does p3+p4 become available? We need 1 in p3 and 1 in p4.

   But p3 has been emptied after T1, and not replenished. The only way p3 gets filled is by unknown — but no transition adds to p3. T1 only affects p0→p1, p2.

   So p3 remains at 0 after T1, never reaches significant numbers.

   p4 gets 1 from p2’s input via T3.

   So p4 ≠ 0 always? After T1: p4=1, then T3 fires if p3=0, but to reach p4+1 state, p3 must be 0 — but with T1 already happened, p3=0 permanently? Not necessarily — no, once p3=0, transitions requiring it (T3, T1 only produces p2,p1) cannot supply it, and no reset.

   So **p3 has permanently zero tokens after T1**.

   **But p4** gets a token from p2 when p2 releases it (T3), so p4 becomes 1, and remains 1 (since no token sink except T4, which would require p3+p4 ≠0, but p3=0).

   So p4=1 for all reachable states.

   **T5: inhibitor from p4** means it’s disabled when p4≠0 — which is always true. So T5 is **inhibited the entire time**.

   Therefore, **no transition T5 can ever fire** in any reachable marking, because its enabling condition is never met.

   Hence, **it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3**, because T5 never fires. But the question is about **relative timing** — is there a sequence where T5 fires before T3 in the marking?

   Since T5 never fires, the condition "fires before T3" is vacuously false.

   However, to be precise: in a reachable marking, **has T5 fired before T3 fired?**

   - For T5 to fire, p4 must be 0 (since inhibitor from p4 blocks it).
   - But p4 becomes 1 after T1 (from T3 firing), and remains 1.
   - P3 becomes 0 after T1 (since no token input, no decrement).
   - So p4≠0 always, so T5 never fires.
   - T3 fires as soon as p2 receives a token (after T1), typically at earliest turn after T1 when p1 is empty (but p1=1 from T1, so T2 inert). But p2=1 has a token, so no inhibit on p2 — so T3 would fire, but p4 is already 1, so barrier remains.

   But T3 only requires p2 to have a token and a path — but p2 has token, but to enable T3, is there a dependency from p3? No — T3 is only directed towards p4, not requiring p3 to be full.

   T3: p2 → p4 — so when p2 has ≥1, T3 can fire, but only if no inhibitor stops it.

   But in this net, T3 is directly fired when its input site (p2) receives input. The description doesn't say there's a restriction from p3 or p4 — but since no controlling arc from p3 or p4 blocks T3, only p2 drives it, and T3 can fire as soon as p2 has a token.

   After T1, p2 has 1, so T3 could potentially fire, but only if the path p2 → p4 allows it.

   But there is **no arc from p3 to p3**, so initial, after p2 fires (say at turn 1), p2=0, and T3 can proceed — but then p4 increases by 1.

   However, **p4 never goes to 0 because T3 consumes it**: when p2 fires, it transfers to p4, so p4 increases, not decreases.

   The token is lost in p4.

   So p4=1 after T1 and T3.

   And p3=0 from then.

   So p4≠0, so T5 is inhibited, cannot fire.

   Therefore, it is **impossible** for T5 to fire before (or even at) T3 fires.

   **Proof of impossibility:**

   1. From initial marking, p4(0), p3(0).
   2. T1 fires, using p0's token, setting p1(1), p2(1), p0(0).
   3. So at the first step after T1, p4=1.
   4. After that, p3=0 (since no transition adds to p3 and no depilation occurs), p4=1 or more.
   5. The inhibitor arc at the start of T5 (–|p4) means T5 is blocked when p4≠0.
   6. Since p4≠0 at the earliest point where T5 could be fired (after T1), and T5 cannot fire without p4=0, which never occurs, **T5 does not fire in any reachable marking**.
   7. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 fires, because it never fires.

   Thus, the answer is **no**, and the reasoning is complete.

   However, the user asked specifically if it’s possible **before T3** — meaning in any sequence, can T5’s fire occur early relative to T3? The answer in truth is no, since T5 can’t fire at all.

   But to be precise, since the event "T5 fires" never occurs, the predicate is always false.

   But perhaps the user wants a hypothetical? But in safe analysis, we must base on the model.

   Alternatively, did we misread T5?

   Another interpretation: "–|p4" means an **inhibitor arc from p4**, but possibly, the fake notation meant p4 is an aggregator? But no — standard is that –|p4 implies p4 inactive.

   Or perhaps –|p4 means T5 can only fire if sum of input at p4 is zero — but no, p4 is a place.

   Given the confusion, and to align with standard logic, we assume:

   - T5 is enabled if p4=0.
   - But enabling does not mean firing; it means internally the condition is met, but the arc **inhibits** (i.e., blocks) the transition if p4≠0.

   However, since p4 becomes 1 immediately after T1 and never returns to 0, T5 cannot fire.

   So T5 does not fire in any reachable marking.

   Therefore, the answer is **no**, it is impossible for T5 to fire before T3, because T5 never fires.

   But the question is whether it’s *possible*, which is translated as “is it possible”, meaning existentially across reachable markings.

   Since in **all** reachable markings, T5 does not fire, the answer is **no**.

   And even for a single marking: in the marking formed by T1 and T2 immediately after T1 (firing T1, p2=1, T2 incentives p3(0), T3 not triggered yet because p1=1 has no exit), then p3=0, so T5 inhibited.

   If we delay — but there’s no way to keep p3>0.

   Only way to reduce p3: if p3 had a removal, but no.

   So in every possibility, p3=0 after T1, p4=1, so T5 never fires.

   Final answer confirmed.

---

**Answer:** No, it is not possible for T5 to fire before T3 in any reachable marking, and furthermore, **T5 never fires in any such marking**, since the inhibitor arc from p4 blocks it, and p4 never reaches zero.

Proof:  
In the initial marking, p4(0), so to enable T5, p4 would need to be 0 before firing, which it is not, and it never becomes 0 afterward because T3 (which would require p4=0 and std conditions not met due to constant p3=0) would consume tokens but not re-init p3 to allow sustained existence — but p3 is removed entirely after T1 and not replaced. Thus, **T5 is inhibited and never fires**, so cannot fire before T3.
