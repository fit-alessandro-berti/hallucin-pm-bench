Here's the breakdown based on the provided data:

1️⃣ The activity "Manual Fraud Check" occurs 1 time in the excerpt.

2️⃣  An analyst seeing only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks because the excerpt is very small. There's only one instance of "Manual Fraud Check" in three unique cases. The analyst wouldn't know if this is representative of the whole month. For example, the log could have many days or weeks where "Manual Fraud Check" is more or less common. Therefore a larger dataset across the entire month would give a better estimate of the number of times this activity takes place.
