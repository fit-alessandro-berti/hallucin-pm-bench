**Answer**: Non-compliant

**Justifications**:
1. **Rule 1**: The trace complies with this rule as the `PO_Amount` exceeds €10,000, and two approvals are obtained in the correct order - first by the `Procurement_Officer` and then by the `CFO` before the activity `Issue_PO`.

2. **Rule 2**: This rule is violated because although the trace contains the activity `Expedite_Flag`, which makes `Quality_Check` optional, `Risk_Assessment` did not occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. The activities occur in the order of `Expedite_Flag` followed by other activities, with `Ship_Goods` (activity #8) occurring before `Risk_Assessment` (activity #9).

3. **Rule 3**: The trace complies with this rule. `Goods_Received` is followed by `Three_way_match` within two activities: `Goods_Received` (activity #6) -> `Move_to_Quality` (activity #7) -> `Three_way_match` (activity #10).

4. **Rule 4**: The trace complies with this rule. No activity executed by `Intern` directly follows any activity executed by `CFO`. The activity following `CFO` (`Approve_PO_CFO`) involves the `System` (`Expedite_Flag`).

5. **Rule 5**: The trace complies with this rule. `Archive_Record` is the final activity in the trace, and no other activities follow it.

Given the violation noted in justification #2, the trace does not fully respect the official rule set P2P-2025.R1.
