**Answer: Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**  

A concrete firing sequence from the initial marking is  

```
M0  --T1-->  M1  --T2-->  M2  --T5-->  M3
```

| step | transition fired | token distribution (p0 … p6) |
|------|------------------|------------------------------|
| M0   | –                | (1,0,0,0,0,0,0)               |
| T1   | p0 → p1 + p2    | (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)               |
| T2   | p1 → p3         | (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)               |
| T5   | p3 –|p4 → p6    | (0,0,1,0,0,0,1)               |

*Why the sequence is valid*

1. **T1** is enabled because p0 contains a token. After it fires we have a token in p1 and a token in p2.  
2. **T2** is enabled (p1 = 1). After it fires we have a token in p3 while p4 is still empty (p4 = 0).  
3. **T5** requires a token in p3 **and** an empty p4 (inhibitor arc). At marking M2, p3 = 1 and p4 = 0, so T5 is enabled and can fire, consuming the token from p3 and producing a token in p6.

At this point transition **T3** (p2 → p4) has not yet fired; the token that will eventually enable T3 is still sitting in p2. Hence T5 has fired **before** T3.

Thus the net admits a reachable marking where T5 fires prior to T3, and the above three‑step firing sequence demonstrates it.
