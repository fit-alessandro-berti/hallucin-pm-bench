To ensure claims reach "Triage Claim" within 48 hours of submission without adding new activities, modify the start event to a **timer event** (id="Timer_Start") with a 48-hour duration. Attach a **boundary event** to Task_Triage that triggers an escalation if the timer expires before the task starts. This monitors the 48-hour window from submission, escalating if triage isn't initiated promptly.  

**Key changes:**  
1. Replace start event: `<bpmn:startEvent id="Timer_Start" name="Claim Submitted">`  
   ```xml
   <bpmn:timerEventDefinition id="Timer_Definition" />
   </bpmn:startEvent>
   ```  
2. Add boundary event to Task_Triage:  
   ```xml
   <bpmn:boundaryEvent id="Boundary_Timer_Triage" name="Timer" attachedToRef="Task_Triage">
     <bpmn:timerEventDefinition id="Timer_Definition" />
   </bpmn:boundaryEvent>
   ```  
3. Connect to an escalation event (e.g., `<bpmn:intermediateCatchEvent id="Escalation_Event">`) triggered by the boundary event.  

This enforces the 48-hour SLA without new tasks, using existing elements.
