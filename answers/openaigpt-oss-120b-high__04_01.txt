Non-compliant  

1. **Rule 2 violation** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event 4). When this flag is present, `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event 8, while `Risk_Assessment` occurs later at event 9, i.e., **after** `Ship_Goods`.  

2. **Rule 3 violation** – After `Goods_Received` (event 6), `Three_way_match` must be performed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The next two activities after event 6 are `Move_to_Quality` (event 7) and `Ship_Goods` (event 8); `Three_way_match` only appears at event 10, which is four steps after `Goods_Received`, exceeding the allowed distance.  

(Other rules are satisfied: Rule 1 approvals order is correct; Rule 4 has no Intern directly after a CFO activity; Rule 5 ends with `Archive_Record`.)
