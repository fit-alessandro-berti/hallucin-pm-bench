Here is the RACI matrix for FinCo’s order-to-cash workflow, using the **strictly required terminology** and role assignments:

| Activity                      | Account Manager (AM) | Compliance Officer (CO) | Finance Clerk (FC) | IT Support (IT) |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Receive Application           | **R**                | I                       | I                  | C               |
| KYC Review                    | C                    | **R**                   | I                  | I               |
| Order Vetting                 | **R**                | I                       | I                  | C               |
| Payment Clearance             | C                    | I                       | **R**              | I               |
| Record Update                 | C                    | I                       | I                  | **R**           |
| Notify Customer               | **R**                | I                       | I                  | C               |

**Legend**:  
- **R** = Responsible (performs the activity)  
- **A** = Accountable (approves or owns outcome — *not used here, as all activities are operationally delegated*)  
- **C** = Consulted (provides input; two-way communication)  
- **I** = Informed (notified after completion; one-way communication)  

*Note*:  
- **KYC Review** replaces “Customer Due Diligence” per your vocabulary policy.  
- **Order Vetting** replaces “Order Validation”.  
- **Payment Clearance** replaces “Payment Processing”.  
- No other terminology deviations were made.
