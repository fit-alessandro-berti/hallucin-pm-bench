### Compliance Assessment:
**Non-compliant**

### Justification:
1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (activity #4), which makes `Quality_Check` optional (and absent here, which is allowed). However, `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods`. `Ship_Goods` occurs at activity #8, but `Risk_Assessment` occurs at activity #9, which is after, not before. This violates Rule 2.
   
2. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (activity #6), `Three_way_match` must occur within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The activity at #7 is `Move_to_Quality`, and the activity at #8 is `Ship_Goods`, neither is `Three_way_match`. `Three_way_match` occurs at activity #10, which is a distance of 4 (after #6, positions #7, #8, #9, then #10). This exceeds the allowed distance and violates Rule 3.

### Additional Notes:
- Rule 1 is satisfied: PO amount exceeds €10 000, and `Approve_PO` (Procurement Officer) and `Approve_PO_CFO` (CFO) both occur before `Issue_PO` (activities #2, #3, and #5).
- Rule 4 is satisfied: No activity by `Intern` directly follows an activity by `CFO`. `Intern` (activity #7) follows `Warehouse_Clerk` (activity #6), not `CFO` (activity #3).
- Rule 5 is satisfied: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (activity #11) with nothing after it.
