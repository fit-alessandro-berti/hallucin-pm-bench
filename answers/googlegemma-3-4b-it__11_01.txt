**MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** COO, Orion Insurance
**FROM:** [Your Name], Senior Process-Mining Analyst
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Urgent: Addressing Claim Processing Bottlenecks

This memo outlines critical performance issues identified in our claim processing workflow. Based on our analysis of the last 12 months, the following activities present the greatest waiting-time challenges:

1.  **Request_Documents:** Avg. Waiting Time: 36.5 hours, 95th-Percentile: 120.0 hours – **Recommendation:** Implement a proactive document request checklist, ensuring all necessary data is readily available before submission to reduce requests for missing information.
2.  **Initial_Screening:** Avg. Waiting Time: 2.1 hours, 95th-Percentile: 5.6 hours – **Recommendation:** Introduce automated eligibility checks, streamlining initial assessments and reducing manual review time. 
3.  **Send_Closure_Letter:** Avg. Waiting Time: 12.2 hours, 95th-Percentile: 44.0 hours – **Recommendation:** Automate the generation and distribution of closure letters, eliminating manual drafting and mailing processes. 

These actions, if implemented, are projected to reduce these waiting times by at least 20%. Further analysis will be conducted to explore additional optimization opportunities.
