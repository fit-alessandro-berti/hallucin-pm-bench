Justification:  
- Rule 1: Both QE and RA must occur in order. In the trace, RA appears after QE, so this rule is satisfied.  
- Rule 2: For High severity, VP must occur after both QE and RA. In the trace, VP is after both, so this is satisfied.  
- Rule 3: NA must not occur before both QE and RA are complete. In the trace, NA occurs before both QE and RA have happened (NA is the 3rd event, QE is 2nd, RA is 4th). This violates Rule 3.  
- Rule 4: CC must occur after NA. In this trace, CC is last, so this is satisfied.  
Because Rule 3 is violated, the trace is not compliant.
