Analysis of throughput times against SLAs and waiting times identifies the three worst-performing activities:

1. **Legal Approval**: Throughput 900s exceeds SLA (600s) by 300s; waiting time 600s.  
2. **Risk Review**: Throughput 600s exceeds SLA (300s) by 300s; waiting time 480s.  
3. **Credit Assessment**: Throughput 300s exceeds SLA (240s) by 60s; waiting time 200s.

These breaches are driven predominantly by excessive waiting times, indicating capacity constraints.

Recommendations:  
- **Legal Approval**: Add one legal approver to parallelize work, targeting a 50% reduction in waiting time to meet the 600s SLA.  
- **Risk Review**: Add one risk reviewer to halve waiting time, closing the 300s SLA gap.  
- **Credit Assessment**: Add one credit assessor to reduce waiting by 50%, eliminating the 60s SLA exceedance.
