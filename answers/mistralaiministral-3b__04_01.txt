**Compliant**

1. The PO amount exceeded â‚¬10 000, so it required two approvals:
   - First by a *Procurement Officer* (Activity 2)
   - Then by the *CFO* (Activity 3)
   - Both approvals occurred before the `Issue_PO` activity (Activity 5).

2. The trace contains the `Expedite_Flag` activity (Activity 4):
   - Activity `Quality_Check` becomes optional (Activity 7 is not required).
   - Activity `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first occurrence of `Ship_Goods` (Activity 9).

3. After `Goods_Received` (Activity 6), activity `Three_way_match` is completed within the next two activities (Activity 10).

4. No activity executed by the role **Intern** directly follows an activity executed by the role **CFO**.

5. The trace finishes with `Archive_Record` (Activity 11) and contains nothing after it.
