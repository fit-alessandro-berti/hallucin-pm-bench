# Analysis

I need to determine whether T5 can fire before T3 from the initial marking.

## Prerequisites for firing

**T5 requires:** both `pd` and `pe` as input
**T3 requires:** `pc` as input

## Tracing paths to T5

For T5 to fire, I need tokens in both `pd` and `pe`.

**Token in `pe`:**
- Only T4 produces `pe`
- T4 requires `pb`
- `pb` is produced only by T1
- So the sequence must include: T1 → T4

**Token in `pd`:**
- T2b produces `pd` (requires `pa`)
- T3 produces `pd` (requires `pc`)

### Fastest path to get both tokens:

**Via T2b (shortcut):**
1. T1: `p0` → `pa, pb`
2. T2b: `pa` → `pd`  
3. T4: `pb` → `pe`
4. **T5 fires:** `pd, pe` → `pf`

At this point, `pc` has never been produced, so **T3 cannot fire yet**.

## Verification

After the sequence **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**:
- Marking: `pc=0, pd=0, pe=0, pf=1`
- T3 is **not enabled** (no token in `pc`)
- T5 **has already fired**

## Answer

**YES**, T5 can fire before T3.

**Shortest firing sequence:** `T1, T2b, T4, T5`

**Explanation:** The transition T2b provides a shortcut that allows `pd` to be produced without requiring `pc`. By using this shortcut together with the parallel path through T4, a token can reach both `pd` and `pe` simultaneously, enabling T5 to fire before T3 ever has a chance to execute.
