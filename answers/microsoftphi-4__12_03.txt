No.

The fact is not accurate according to the event-log excerpt. There are cases in the log where the activity "Validate_Payment" does not immediately follow "Receive_Order" without any other activities in between:

- **Case C001:** The sequence is "Receive_Order" at 09:12, followed by "Validate_Payment" at 09:15. Although this case fits the pattern, it is not the issue; rather, it's demonstrating the exception noted below.
- **Case C002:** There is an intermediate activity. The sequence is "Receive_Order" at 09:30, followed by "Pack_Items" at 09:50, and then "Validate_Payment" at 10:05.
- **Case C004:** There is also an intermediate activity. The sequence begins with "Receive_Order" at 10:05, followed by "Check_Fraud" at 10:07, and later "Validate_Payment" at 10:20.

These exceptions show that "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between.
