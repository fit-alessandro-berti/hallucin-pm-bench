## Question 4: Two Sampling-Related Reasons Why the Monthly Estimate Would Be Unreliable

1. **Small Sample Size**: The fragment contains only 18 events across 4 cases, representing a single day (2025-05-01). This is far too small to extrapolate to an entire month, as it fails to capture the natural variability in order volumes and fraud check frequencies across different days, weeks, or periods.

2. **Temporal Bias (Non-Representative Time Window)**: The data covers only approximately 5 hours on one specific day. This single-day snapshot may not be representative of typical monthly patterns—factors such as weekday vs. weekend differences, seasonal fluctuations, promotional periods, or month-end processing variations are completely unaccounted for, leading to potential systematic bias in any monthly projection.
