a) Decision points and their one-sentence rules  
1. Tri-Color-Risk-Check: assigns every application a Low, Medium, or High risk rating based solely on the three scorecards.  
2. Post-Risk conditional branch: if the rating is Low or Medium AND the amount requested is €250 000 or less, the Manual-Underwriting-Review step is skipped; otherwise that review is performed.  
3. “TriVote” gate: the application passes only when at least any two of the three roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) record their approval.  
4. Applicant-Confirmation gate: the loan can move to Finalize-Agreement only after the applicant returns a signed Offer Sheet 77 together with the ID Matrix Declaration; if either is missing, the process stops.
