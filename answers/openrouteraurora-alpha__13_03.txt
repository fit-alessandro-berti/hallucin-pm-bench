**1️⃣ Count of “Manual Fraud Check”**  
The activity **“Manual Fraud Check”** appears **once** in the excerpt (case 1002, 2025‑03‑01 09:07:13 Z).

**2️⃣ Why the snippet can mislead the analyst (≤ 120 words)**  
The excerpt contains only a handful of cases from a single day and shows a limited set of activities. It may not be representative of the entire month: many cases could involve manual fraud checks that are omitted, or the snippet could be biased toward cases that progressed quickly (e.g., automatic checks). Additionally, the log may have seasonal or workload variations that affect the frequency of manual checks. Relying on this tiny, non‑random slice can therefore under‑ or over‑estimate the true prevalence of manual fraud checks across the full month‑long dataset.
