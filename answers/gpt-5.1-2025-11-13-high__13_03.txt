1️⃣ The activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt.  

2️⃣ The snippet shows only **three cases** (1001–1003) and a short time window on **2025‑03‑01**, while the event log is said to cover an entire month. Within this small slice, there is one “Manual Fraud Check” and two differently labeled automatic checks (“Automatic Fraud Check” and “Fraud Check (Automatic)”). If an analyst extrapolated these ratios to the full month, they would be assuming that volumes, routing, and logging practices are stable over all days and times. Because the sample is tiny and early‑period only, that assumption is unreliable.
