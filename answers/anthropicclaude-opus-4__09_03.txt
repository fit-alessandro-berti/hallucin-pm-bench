I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity from the information provided.

**Reason:** The event log stub (Artefact A) contains only the header row showing column names, with all actual data rows redacted for privacy. Without access to the actual event data - specifically the start_time and complete_time values for cases where the activity is "Approve Invoice" - it is mathematically impossible to calculate cycle times. The cycle time for an activity is computed as (complete_time - start_time) for each instance, and these temporal values are explicitly stated as removed. While Artefact B provides some timing information about the overall process, it only gives the average time between two activities (Approve Invoice to Pay Invoice), not the cycle time of the Approve Invoice activity itself, which would be the duration from when that specific activity starts until it completes.
