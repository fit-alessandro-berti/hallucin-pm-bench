## Decision Points in Contoso's Refund Process

There are **two decision points** in the process:

### 1. Eligibility Gate — *Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility*
- The triage agent assesses whether the claim qualifies for a refund.
- **Outcome:** The claim either passes (proceeding to Finance_Controller_PreApprove) or fails (implicitly rejected).
- Evidence checked: the **FlightManifest** and the **WeatherReport**.

### 2. High-Value Branch — Refund Amount Threshold
- After Finance_Controller_PreApprove, the process checks whether the refund amount **exceeds €1,000**.
- **If yes:** the case must go through **Senior_Auditor_Review** before payment can proceed.
- **If no:** the process moves directly to Process_Refund_Payment.
