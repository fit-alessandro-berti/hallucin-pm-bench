**Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?**

We identify distinct cases by the `case` attribute:

- C001 (lines 1, 3, 7)  
- C002 (lines 2, 5, 8, 10)  
- C003 (lines 4, 6, 9)

So, there are **3 distinct cases**.

✅ **Answer: 3**

---

**Q2: For case “C002”, list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).**

Extract events for case C002 (in order of appearance / timestamp):

- Line 2: Receive_Order  
- Line 5: Check_Stock  
- Line 8: Arrange_Delivery  
- Line 10: Ship_Order  

So the sequence is:

✅ **Answer: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order**

---

**Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).**

Find all occurrences of “Ship_Order” and look at the activity that comes **immediately before it** in the same case:

- **C001**:  
  - Events: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
  - Activity before Ship_Order: **Check_Stock**

- **C002**:  
  - Events: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order  
  - Activity before Ship_Order: **Arrange_Delivery**

- **C003**:  
  - Events: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Ship_Order  
  - Activity before Ship_Order: **Check_Stock**

So the set of activities that immediately precede “Ship_Order” is:
- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock

Now sort **alphabetically**:

- Arrange_Delivery  
- Check_Stock

✅ **Answer:**  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
