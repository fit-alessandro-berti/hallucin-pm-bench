**Compliant**

1. **Rule 1**: The PO amount is €12,300, which exceeds €10,000. The trace includes both `Approve_PO` by the *Procurement Officer* (event #2) and `Approve_PO_CFO` by the *CFO* (event #3), occurring before `Issue_PO` (event #5). Thus, the two required approvals are present and correctly ordered → **compliant**.

2. **Rule 2**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4). As a result, `Quality_Check` is not required (it is optional), and `Risk_Assessment` must occur before the first `Ship_Goods`. `Risk_Assessment` occurs at event #9, and `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8 — this violates the required order. However, **this is not a violation** because `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** `Ship_Goods`, but in the trace it occurs **after**. Therefore, this **violates Rule 2** → **non-compliant**?

   Correction: On re-evaluation — event #8 is `Ship_Goods` at 09:40, and event #9 is `Risk_Assessment` at 10:31 → `Risk_Assessment` occurs **after** `Ship_Goods`. This **violates Rule 2**, which requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods` when `Expedite_Flag` is present.

   → **This makes the trace non-compliant with Rule 2**.

3. Despite compliance with Rules 1, 3, 4, and 5, a **single violation** is sufficient to render the trace non-compliant.

**Corrected Answer:**

**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 2 violation**: The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event #4), which requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. However, `Ship_Goods` occurs at event #8 (09:40), and `Risk_Assessment` occurs at event #9 (10:31), **after** shipping. This violates the mandatory order.

All other rules are satisfied:
- Rule 1: Two approvals (Procurement Officer and CFO) occur before `Issue_PO`.
- Rule 3: `Three_way_match` occurs at event #10, which is within two activities after `Goods_Received` (event #6): event #7 and #8 → distance = 4? Wait:  
  `Goods_Received` = #6 → next two activities: #7 and #8 → `Three_way_match` is at #10 → that’s **three** activities later (positions 7, 8, 9 before it), so distance = 4? No:

  Activity order after #6:
  - #7: Move_to_Quality
  - #8: Ship_Goods
  - #9: Risk_Assessment
  - #10: Three_way_match → this is the **fourth** activity after `Goods_Received`.

  So the distance is **4**, which exceeds the allowed **≤2**.

  → **Rule 3 is also violated**.

Let’s re-analyze carefully.

---

**Final Correct Answer: Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 3 violation**: After `Goods_Received` (event #6), `Three_way_match` (event #10) must occur within the next two activities (i.e., at event #7, #8, or at latest #8). The sequence is:
   - #7: Move_to_Quality
   - #8: Ship_Goods
   - #9: Risk_Assessment
   - #10: Three_way_match

   → `Three_way_match` occurs **4 activities after** `Goods_Received`, so the distance is **4**, which exceeds the maximum allowed of 2. Hence, **Rule 3 is violated**.

2. **Rule 2 violation**: The presence of `Expedite_Flag` (event #4) requires `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** `Ship_Goods`. However:
   - `Ship_Goods` = #8 (09:40)
   - `Risk_Assessment` = #9 (10:31)
   → `Risk_Assessment` occurs **after** `Ship_Goods` → **violation**.

3. **Rule 4**: No activity executed by **Intern** may **directly follow** one by **CFO**.
   - CFO executes #3: Approve_PO_CFO
   - Next is #4: Expedite_Flag → executed by **System**
   - Then #5: Issue_PO → System
   - Then #7: Move_to_Quality → **Intern**, but not directly after CFO (three events in between, all by System)
   → No direct succession from CFO to Intern → **compliant**.

4. **Rule 5**: The trace ends with `Archive_Record` (event #11) and has no activities after → **compliant**.

5. **Rule 1**: PO > €10,000 → requires two approvals: Procurement Officer (#2) and CFO (#3), both before `Issue_PO` (#5) → **compliant**.

Despite compliance with Rules 1, 4, and 5, **violations of Rule 2 and Rule 3** are present.

**Final verdict:**

**Non-compliant**

1. **Rule 2 violation**: `Risk_Assessment` (event #9) occurs after `Ship_Goods` (event #8), but must occur before when `Expedite_Flag` is present.

2. **Rule 3 violation**: `Three_way_match` (event #10) occurs four activities after `Goods_Received` (event #6), exceeding the allowed maximum distance of 2.
