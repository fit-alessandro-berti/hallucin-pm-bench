To determine whether **T5** can fire before **T3** in the given Petri net, we analyze the structure and transitions within the net. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

### Initial Marking:

- `p0 = 1` (all other places are 0)

### Firing Sequence Analysis

1. **Initial transitions**
	- **T1** is the only transition that can fire, as it is the only one enabled (enabled by `p0 = 1`).
	- Firing **T1** produces:
		- `pa = 1`
		- `pb = 1`
		- `p0 = 0`
2. **Enabling T5**
	- For **T5** to fire, we need both `pd = 1` and `pe = 1`.
	- **T2b**: Firing this transition consumes `pa = 1` and produces `pd = 1`, enabling `T5`.
		- After firing **T2b**, the marking is: `pd = 1`, `pb = 1`
	- **T4**: Firing this transition consumes `pb = 1` and produces `pe = 1`.
		- After firing **T4**, the marking is: `pd = 1`, `pe = 1`
	- At this point, **T5** can fire with the marking `pd = 1` and `pe = 1`.

### Is **T3** Fired Before **T5**?

- For **T3** to fire, `pc` must be marked, which requires:
	- **T2** to fire after **T1**, consuming `pa = 1` and producing `pc = 1`.

However, in the shortest path to enabling **T5**, **T2b** is fired instead of **T2**. This means **T2b** skips producing `pc`, and as a result:

- **T5 can fire without T3**, making it possible for **T5** to fire before **T3**.

### Shortest Firing Sequence

The **shortest firing sequence** enabling **T5** before **T3** is:

**"T1 → T2b → T4 → T5"**

### **Conclusion**

Yes, it is **possible** for **T5** to fire before **T3**. A formal reasoning is that the structure of the net allows **T5** to be enabled via **T2b**, skipping the normal path involving **T3**.
