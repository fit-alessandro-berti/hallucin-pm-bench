**Answer:** No

**Justification:**
The trace violates **Rule 3**, which states that `Notify_Authorities` (NA) must occur **after** both `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA). In the trace, NA occurs between QE and RA, violating the required ordering. The trace also violates **Rule 1** because while QE and RA occur once each, they are not in the required order (QE must precede RA). The trace satisfies **Rules 2 and 4** because:
- VP occurs after QE and RA (Rule 2, since severity is "High").
- CC occurs after NA (and VP, as required by Rule 2).
