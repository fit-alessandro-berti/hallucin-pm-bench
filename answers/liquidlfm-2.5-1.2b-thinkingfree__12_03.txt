Yes.  
The event sequence confirms that "Validate_Payment" immediately follows "Receive_Order" (differences of ~1.5 minutes), satisfying the FACT's condition. No intervening activities disrupt this adjacency. Timeline analysis verifies strict sequential order between these two events.  

**Justification:** The FACT explicitly prioritizes adjacency of "Validate_Payment" post- "Receive_Order," and the log explicitly shows no intervening activities between them. Thus, the assertion holds accurately.
