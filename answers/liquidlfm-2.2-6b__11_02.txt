**Executive Memo: Claims Handling Performance Issues & Recommendations**

Acme Insuranceâ€™s claims handling process exhibits three key inefficiencies based on Q1-2025 performance:  

1. **Approve Claim** underperforms with **just 182 cases/day**, lowest throughput among all activities (vs. 270+ for others). This indicates bottlenecks in final approval workflows.  
   *Action:* Implement a standardized fast-track approval checklist and automate routine approvals to reduce cycle time.  

2. **Review Documents** has the highest average processing time of **25 minutes**, the most processing variance (**9 min**), and an SLA breach rate of **12.4%**. This suggests inconsistent review quality and timing, delaying claims.  
   *Action:* Train reviewers on standardized workflows and introduce a quality control checkpoint to ensure consistency and reduce breaches.  

3. **Calculate Payout** shows high variability (**2 min** stdev), indicating unpredictable processing times that risk SLA compliance.  
   *Action:* Develop a toolkit of common payout templates and automate data pull integration to reduce variability and speed up execution.  

These steps will target root causes directly reflected in the performance metrics.
