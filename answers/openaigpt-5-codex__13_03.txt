1️⃣ “Manual Fraud Check” appears **once** in the excerpt.

2️⃣ This snippet covers just three cases from a single morning (March 1, 2025) and therefore represents only a tiny fraction of the month-long log. With such a limited sample, the proportion of manual fraud checks could be far above or below the true monthly rate: other cases, days, or weeks might show very different behavior (including none or many more manual checks). Hence, relying on this fragment alone risks a serious misestimate of how prevalent manual fraud checks really are.
