Subject: Process Performance Review  

The three worst-performing activities at Orion Credit are identified based on SLA breaches and high waiting times.  

- **Legal Approval** exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (900s vs. 600s) and has a waiting time of 600s, the highest in the process.  
- **Risk Review** exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (600s vs. 300s) and has a waiting time of 480s, the second-highest.  
- **Credit Assessment** exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds (300s vs. 240s) and has a waiting time of 200s, the third-highest.  

Recommendations:  
- Implement additional resources or automation for Legal Approval to reduce SLA breach and waiting time.  
- Optimize workflow or add staff to Risk Review to meet SLA and reduce delays.  
- Streamline Credit Assessment processes to improve SLA compliance and reduce waiting time.
