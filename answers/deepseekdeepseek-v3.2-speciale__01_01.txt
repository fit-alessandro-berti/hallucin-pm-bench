**Decision Points**

- The process includes one explicit decision point: **whether the refund amount exceeds €1,000**.  
  - If the amount is greater than €1,000, the high‑value branch is taken and the activity **Senior_Auditor_Review** (with its required *AuditTrail*) must be performed.  
  - If the amount is €1,000 or less, the **Senior_Auditor_Review** is skipped, and the process proceeds directly to **Process_Refund_Payment** after the preceding approvals.
