Subject: Top 3 Waiting-Time Bottlenecks

Analysis of our process performance over the last 12 months identifies the following three activities with the highest waiting times:

1. **Request_Documents**: 36.5h average (120.0h 95p).
   *Action:* Automate document request triggers within the claims portal to eliminate manual notification lag.
2. **Send_Closure_Letter**: 12.2h average (44.0h 95p).
   *Action:* Implement Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to instantly generate and dispatch letters upon claim finalization.
3. **Assess_Liability**: 7.8h average (16.4h 95p).
   *Action:* Deploy a rule-based triage engine to auto-assign liability tasks to available adjusters in real-time.

Targeting these specific queues through automation and improved task allocation will reduce current waiting times by at least 20% by removing manual handoff delays.
