Subject: Analysis of Process Performance Bottlenecks at Orion Credit

Dear COO,

I have analyzed the provided process data for our credit application workflow. Based on SLA breaches and high average waiting times, the three worst-performing activities are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds and has an average waiting time of 600 seconds. Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds and has an average waiting time of 480 seconds. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds and has an average waiting time of 200 seconds.

To improve performance, I recommend the following data-driven actions:

- Allocate additional resources to Legal Approval to reduce its throughput exceedance of 300 seconds and waiting time of 600 seconds per case.
- Prioritize Risk Review cases with waiting times over 480 seconds by automating initial checks, as the SLA breach of 300 seconds suggests capacity constraints.
- Streamline Credit Assessment for cases exceeding 200 seconds of waiting by training staff on efficient evaluation, addressing its 60-second SLA breach.
