Add a Timer Intermediate Catch Event with a 48h boundary on the exclusive path after GW_Docs. Reconnect the flow that currently ends at Task_RequestDocs (f4) to this timer. After the timer event, redirect the flow directly to Task_Triage (skip requesting docs). The flow to Task_RequestDocs remains on the conditional path (f4) without the timer.

This guarantees Triage (Task_Triage) within 48h: if documents are complete, the process proceeds normally; if not, the claim auto-advances to Triage after the timer instead of waiting for request/response, ensuring SLA compliance while reusing existing activities.
