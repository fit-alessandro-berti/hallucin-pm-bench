It is not possible to compute the average cycle time (in hours) of the activity “Approve Invoice”, nor its standard deviation or a 95 % confidence interval, because the event log contains no actual data rows—all timestamp values in the columns start_time and complete_time have been redacted for privacy reasons. Without the start and completion timestamps for each occurrence of the “Approve Invoice” activity, the duration of individual instances cannot be calculated, and no statistical measures can be derived from the log. The provided SLA catalogue contains only a historical average from “Approve Invoice” to “Pay Invoice” (7.8 days), which is a different process segment and cannot be used to infer the duration of the “Approve Invoice” activity itself.
