Let's analyze the case trace and determine whether this case is compliant with each of the rules R1-R6.

R1. Any purchase order with total_amount > €10,000 must have Manager_Approval followed by Finance_Approval.

Let's check if this rule was followed:
1. Create_PO - amount = €12,450, which is > €10,000.
2. Manager_Approval - occurred on 2025-03-03 at 11:05.
3. Finance_Approval - occurred on 2025-03-04 at 08:17.

So, Manager_Approval indeed followed Finance_Approval. The rule appears to be violated because Finance_Approval should follow Manager_Approval, but here Manager_Approval came before Finance_Approval. So, R1 is **Violated**.

Wait, let me recalculate this. The steps are:
1. Create_PO
2. Manager_Approval
3. Finance_Approval

So, Manager_Approval first, then Finance_Approval. This satisfies R1, since the rule says Manager_Approval must be followed by Finance_Approval.

R2. If expedited = true, Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval.

Let's check if this rule was followed:
1. Create_PO - expedited = true.
2. Manager_Approval - occurred on 2025-03-03 at 11:05.
3. Finance_Approval - occurred on 2025-03-04 at 08:17.
4. Ship_Goods - occurred on 2025-03-05 at 10:26.

So, Ship_Goods occurred on 2025-03-05, which is 1 day after Finance_Approval (the last required approval). This satisfies the rule that Ship_Goods must occur within 2 calendar days after the last required approval. Thus, R2 is **Compliant**.

R3. Pay_Invoice must never occur before Receive_Goods.

Let's check if this rule was followed:
4. Pay_Invoice - occurred on 2025-03-06 at 09:00.
6. Receive_Goods - occurred on 2025-03-07 at 14:13.

So, Pay_Invoice occurred before Receive_Goods. This violates the rule. Thus, R3 is **Violated**.

R4. If hazardous = true, a Safety_Inspection must occur after Receive_Goods and before Store_Goods.

Let's check if this rule was followed:
1. Create_PO - hazardous = false.

Since hazardous = false, the rule doesn't apply to this case. Thus, R4 is **Not Applicable**.

R5. If a Change_Request happens after any approval, the purchase order must obtain a new Manager_Approval before any further processing step.

Let's check if this rule was followed:
2. Manager_Approval - first approval
3. Change_Request - occurred on 2025-03-04 at 15:42.
4. Manager_Approval - second occurrence, occurred on 2025-03-07 at 15:10.

So, after the Change_Request, they did get a new Manager_Approval before continuing. This satisfies the rule. Thus, R5 is **Compliant**.

R6. Every case must terminate with Archive_Record.

Let's check if this rule was followed:
10. Archive_Record - the last step in the trace.

So, the case does terminate with Archive_Record. This satisfies the rule. Thus, R6 is **Compliant**.

Let's sum up:
R1: **Compliant** - Manager_Approval was followed by Finance_Approval.
R2: **Compliant** - Ship_Goods occurred within 2 calendar days after the last required approval.
R3: **Violated** - Pay_Invoice occurred before Receive_Goods.
R4: **Not Applicable** - hazardous was false.
R5: **Compliant** - A new Manager_Approval was obtained after the Change_Request.
R6: **Compliant** - The case terminated with Archive_Record.

Since at least one rule (R3) was violated, the overall result is **NON-COMPLIANT**.
# Compliance Analysis for Case #47291

R1. **Compliant** - Manager_Approval occurred before Finance_Approval for PO of €12,450.

R2. **Compliant** - Ship_Goods occurred on 2025-03-05, within 2 days after Finance_Approval on 2025-03-04.

R3. **Violated** - Pay_Invoice on 2025-03-06 occurred before Receive_Goods on 2025-03-07.

R4. **Not Applicable** - The hazardous flag is false, so this rule doesn't apply.

R5. **Compliant** - After Change_Request, a new Manager_Approval was obtained before further processing.

R6. **Compliant** - The case terminated with Archive_Record.

**NON-COMPLIANT**
