None of the three requested metrics can be computed.

The sole reason is that Artefact A contains no data whatsoever. Every row and every timestamp value has been explicitly removed for privacy purposes; only the column header names remain. Without at least one pair of start_time and complete_time values for cases where the activity equals "Approve Invoice," it is impossible to derive any individual activity duration, let alone an average cycle time, a standard deviation, or a confidence interval. Artefact B supplies a high-level SLA target and a historical benchmark for the Approve-to-Pay interval, but neither figure is a substitute for the raw per-instance durations needed to perform the calculations you have requested. No amount of reasoning over column names or external knowledge about P2P processes can fill that gap without introducing fabricated numbers, which I will not do.
