**No**

- **Rule 1:** Satisfied – Both QE and RA occur exactly once, and QE appears before RA in the trace.  
- **Rule 2:** Satisfied – Severity is High, and VP occurs after both QE and RA.  
- **Rule 3:** Violated – NA occurs before RA is complete; it must happen only after both QE and RA are finished.  
- **Rule 4:** Satisfied – CC occurs after NA and after VP (as required).  

Because Rule 3 is violated, the trace is **not compliant** with ruleset R.
