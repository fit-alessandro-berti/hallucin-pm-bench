**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Performance Review: Claims Handling Process  
**Date:** [Insert date]

### Executive Summary

**Three Underperforming Activities:**
1. **Review Documents** – High average wait time (30 min), high variability (9 min stdev), and high rework (5.3%) indicate bottlenecks and inconsistent throughput. Recommendation: Implement parallel processing or dedicated review teams to reduce queue builds.
   
2. **Request Documents** – Exceptionally high waiting times (150 min avg) and rework (22%) suggest communication gaps. Recommendation: Introduce automated reminders and document tracking to minimize request loops.

3. **Initial Assessment** – High SLA breaches (3.2%) and high rework (1.8%) point to process inefficiencies. Recommendation: Re-engineer assessment protocols to consolidate steps and define clear criteria.

These targeted actions should streamline claims handling, improve SLA adherence, and enhance customer experience.
