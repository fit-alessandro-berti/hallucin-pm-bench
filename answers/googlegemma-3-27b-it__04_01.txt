Non-compliant

1. Rule 1 is violated: The PO amount is €12,300 (above €10,000), requiring approval from both a Procurement Officer *and* the CFO *before* `Issue_PO`. While both approvals are present, `Issue_PO` (activity 5) occurs *after* the CFO approval (activity 3), which is acceptable.
2. Rule 3 is violated: `Goods_Received` (activity 6) occurs before `Three_way_match` (activity 10). The rule states that `Three_way_match` must be completed within the *next two* activities after `Goods_Received`. Activities 7, 8 and 9 occur between `Goods_Received` and `Three_way_match`, exceeding the allowed distance of 2.
3. Rule 4 is violated: `Move_to_Quality` (activity 7) is executed by an `Intern` directly following `Approve_PO_CFO` (activity 3) executed by a `CFO`. This is explicitly forbidden by the rule.
