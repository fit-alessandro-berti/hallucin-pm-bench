Add a boundary timer event to "Task_RequestDocs" (ID: Timer_DocWait) set to trigger after 36 hours. When this timer expires, it creates a direct flow to "Task_Triage", bypassing the wait for complete documentation. This ensures all claims reach triage within the 48-hour SLA window, even when claimants are slow to provide missing documents. The process can then continue with triage based on available information while document collection continues in parallel if needed.
