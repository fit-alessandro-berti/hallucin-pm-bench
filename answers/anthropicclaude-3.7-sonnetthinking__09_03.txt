# Inability to Compute "Approve Invoice" Cycle Time

I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity based on the provided information. The event log stub (Artefact A) only shows column headers without any actual event data - all timestamps, case IDs, and activity values have been redacted for privacy reasons. Without the actual start_time and complete_time values for "Approve Invoice" activities, it's impossible to calculate any time-based metrics. The SLA Catalogue (Artefact B) provides historical averages for the time between activities, but not the cycle time within a specific activity, which would require the actual event data.
