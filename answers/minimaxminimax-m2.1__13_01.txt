### Answers

1. **Exact occurrences of “Manual_Fraud_Check”**:  
   The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **exactly 1 time** in the log fragment (in case A1002 at 10:50:00).

2. **Percentage of all logged events**:  
   Total logged events = 18.  
   Percentage = (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ **5.56%** (rounded to two decimal places).

3. **Case identifiers containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”**:  
   The only case containing this activity is **A1002**.

4. **Two sampling-related reasons for unreliable monthly frequency estimation**:  
   - **Limited temporal scope**: The fragment covers only a single day (2025-05-01), failing to capture monthly variability (e.g., weekends, holidays, or end-of-month trends). Fraud checks may fluctuate significantly over a full month, making one-day data unrepresentative.  
   - **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 18 events and 4 cases. This is insufficient to reliably estimate the frequency of a rare event (e.g., manual fraud checks occurred once here). A broader dataset is needed to reduce sampling bias and ensure statistical significance.
