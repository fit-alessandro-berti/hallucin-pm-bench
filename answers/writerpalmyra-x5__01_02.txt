**Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process:**

1. **Quick KYC Verification (KYC)** – Proceeds only after successful confirmation of ID card and mobile phone; no credit-bureau checks are performed.  
2. **Community Impact Assessment (CIA)** – Conducted by an Impact Officer; determines eligibility based on community benefit.  
3. **Underwriter Alignment Gate** – Compares risk scores from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**:
   - If scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, process continues to step 6.
   - If difference is **> 2 points**, escalation to the **Harmonisation Committee** is required for a tie-break decision.  
4. **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)** – Requires collection of at least **3 local references** using the Neighbourhood Feedback Form before advancing.  
5. **Amount Threshold Decision** – Determines next approval authority:
   - If **amount < €15 000**, system triggers auto-approval.  
   - If **amount ≥ €15 000**, case proceeds to the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.  
6. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – Board votes to *approve* or *reject* applications meeting the threshold.
