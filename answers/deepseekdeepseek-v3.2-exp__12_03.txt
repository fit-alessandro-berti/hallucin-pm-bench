**No**

**Justification:**

The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" **always** occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," with no other activities in between.

This is not true for Case C004.
*   In Case C004, the sequence is: `Receive_Order` -> `Check_Fraud` -> `Validate_Payment`.
*   The activity "Check_Fraud" occurs between "Receive_Order" and "Validate_Payment," violating the condition of "no other activities in between."

The sequences for the other cases (C001, C002, C003) are consistent with the fact, but the existence of a single counter-example (C004) makes the universal statement "always" false.
