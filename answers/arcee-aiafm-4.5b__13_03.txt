### 2️⃣ In ≤ 120 words, explain why an analyst who sees **only this snippet** might still misestimate how common manual fraud checks are in the full month-long log.

An analyst examining only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks due to several potential limitations:

1. **Sample size**: The provided data contains only 4 cases, which is a very small sample compared to an entire month's worth of data.

2. **Incomplete time range**: The data only covers activities up to 2025-03-01, not the full month.

3. **Data partitioning**: The cases might represent different segments or days, not a comprehensive day-by-day analysis.

4. **Lack of frequency distribution**: Without knowing how many times each activity occurred overall, it's difficult to assess the relative frequency of manual fraud checks.

5. **Context missing**: Details about the timing, circumstances, or outcomes of these checks aren't provided.

6. **Potential outliers**: The cases included might be atypical, skewing the perceived frequency.

7. **Overlooking subsequent activities**: Later cases might not be included, potentially missing a higher number of occurrences.

Without additional data, an analyst might underestimate or overestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks based solely on this limited sample.
