No. In case C003, the payment was validated before the order was received (line 6 shows C003 Validate_Payment at 10:43Z, followed by C003 Receive_Order at 10:45Z in line 7), so it did not follow a Receive_Order. In case C005 there is no Receive_Order event at all (lines 11–12 are C005 Validate_Payment and Cancel_Order), so Validate_Payment cannot follow it.
