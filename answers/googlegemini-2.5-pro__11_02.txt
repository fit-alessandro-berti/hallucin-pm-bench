**To:** COO  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Brief & Recommendations

This memo highlights the three most critical activities impacting the performance of our Q1-2025 Claims Handling process.

1.  **Request Documents**: This is the primary process bottleneck. It suffers from an extremely high rework rate of 22.0% and an average wait time of 150 minutes, causing throughput to drop significantly.
    *   **Recommendation**: Implement a standardized digital checklist to ensure all necessary documents are requested on the first attempt, targeting a reduction in the rework rate.

2.  **Review Documents**: This activity has the highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), which is driven by it having the longest average processing time (25 minutes) and the highest variability (9-minute standard deviation).
    *   **Recommendation**: Introduce a "fast-track" path for simple cases, allowing senior reviewers to focus on complex ones, thereby reducing the average time and inconsistency.

3.  **Initial Assessment**: This early-stage activity is under strain, with a notable SLA breach rate of 3.2% and a high average wait time of 18 minutes.
    *   **Recommendation**: Cross-train staff from the better-performing "Register Claim" activity to create flexible capacity and reduce the assessment queue.
