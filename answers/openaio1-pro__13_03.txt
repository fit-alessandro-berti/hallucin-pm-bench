Answer:  
1) The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” appears 1 time.  

2) This snippet covers only a narrow window (events from a single day) rather than the entire month’s entries. Within this limited sample, there is just one “Manual Fraud Check,” which might mislead an analyst into assuming manual checks rarely happen. However, because the complete log is not shown, there could be more manual checks on other days. With only these few rows, there is insufficient information to accurately gauge the frequency of manual fraud checks in the entire March 2025 dataset.
