1. The exact activity string "Manual Fraud Check" occurs **1** time.

2. An analyst observing only this snippet might misestimate the frequency of "Manual Fraud Check" due to several reasons. Firstly, the snippet is very short, only covering a few hours on a single day. This limited timeframe may not capture the full variability of the process over the month. Secondly, the presence of "Automatic Fraud Check" and "Fraud Check (Automatic)" suggests that manual fraud checks might be conditional or less frequent than automated ones. Without seeing cases where these automated checks might trigger a follow-up manual review, or cases that bypass the automated check and go straight to manual review, the true proportion of manual fraud checks cannot be accurately determined.
