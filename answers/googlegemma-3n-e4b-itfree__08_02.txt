**Question 1: Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before T3.**

**Question 2 (Bonus):**

Here's a minimal firing sequence:

1.  **T1:** P0 -> {P1, P2}
2.  **T3:** P2 -> {P4}
3.  **T4:** P4 -> {P5}
4.  **T5:** P2, P5 -> {P6}

This sequence demonstrates that T5 can fire before T3. Initially, T1 splits a token from P0 to P1 and P2. T3 then consumes a token from P2. Subsequently, the token in P2 flows to P4 through T4 and finally to P5. When P2 and P5 are both present, transition T5 can fire, creating a token in P6 *before* T3 consumes the initial token in P2.
