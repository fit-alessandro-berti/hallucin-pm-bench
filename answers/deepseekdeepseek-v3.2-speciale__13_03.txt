1️⃣ **Exact occurrences of "Manual Fraud Check":** 1

2️⃣ The snippet covers only a short period (about 1.5 hours) and three cases, which may not represent the month's volume or distribution. Additionally, naming inconsistencies are evident (e.g., automatic fraud checks appear as both "Automatic Fraud Check" and "Fraud Check (Automatic)"). The full log likely contains more cases and may also use alternative names for manual fraud checks, leading to misestimation if only the exact string is considered.
