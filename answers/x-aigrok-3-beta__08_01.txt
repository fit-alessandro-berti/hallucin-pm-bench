Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking of this Petri net. Below, I provide a concrete firing sequence from the initial marking and a brief justification.

### Firing Sequence:
1. Start at the initial marking: `p0(1), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`.
2. Fire **T1**: This consumes the token from `p0` and adds one token to `p1` and one to `p2`.  
   New marking: `p0(0), p1(1), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`.
3. Fire **T2**: This consumes the token from `p1` and adds one token to `p3`.  
   New marking: `p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(1), p4(0), p5(0), p6(0)`.
4. Fire **T5**: This transition is enabled because `p3` has a token (1 token, satisfying the normal arc condition) and `p4` has no tokens (0 tokens, satisfying the inhibitor arc condition). Firing T5 consumes the token from `p3` and adds one token to `p6`.  
   New marking: `p0(0), p1(0), p2(1), p3(0), p4(0), p5(0), p6(1)`.
5. Fire **T3**: This consumes the token from `p2` and adds one token to `p4`.  
   New marking: `p0(0), p1(0), p2(0), p3(0), p4(1), p5(0), p6(1)`.

### Sequence Summary:
The firing sequence is **T1 → T2 → T5 → T3**. In this sequence, T5 fires at step 3, before T3 fires at step 4.

### Justification:
- After firing T1, tokens are placed in both `p1` and `p2`, allowing parallel processing paths.
- Firing T2 moves the token from `p1` to `p3`, enabling T5 because `p3` has a token and `p4` has no tokens (due to T3 not having fired yet).
- T5 can fire immediately after T2, consuming the token in `p3` and placing a token in `p6`.
- Only after T5 has fired does T3 become relevant again, firing later to move the token from `p2` to `p4`.

This sequence demonstrates that T5 can indeed fire before T3 in a reachable marking, as the inhibitor arc on `p4` allows T5 to be enabled as long as `p4` remains empty, which it is until T3 fires.
