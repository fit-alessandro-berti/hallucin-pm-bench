**No**

**Justification:**

The FACT stated that "The activity 'Validate\_Payment' always occurs immediately after 'Receive\_Order,' with no other activities in between."

This is false based on the following CaseIDs:

1.  **CaseID C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` $\rightarrow$ `Pack_Items` $\rightarrow$ `Validate_Payment`. The activity `Pack_Items` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.
2.  **CaseID C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order` $\rightarrow$ `Check_Fraud` $\rightarrow$ `Validate_Payment`. The activity `Check_Fraud` occurs between `Receive_Order` and `Validate_Payment`.

(Note: Case IDs C001 and C003 *do* follow this pattern, but the FACT requires it to be true for *all* occurrences, which is contradicted by C002 and C004.)
