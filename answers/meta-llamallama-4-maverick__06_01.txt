To solve this task, we need to carefully examine Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder and identify the tasks that can be executed in parallel.

According to the description of Process B:
1. Create_Work_Order
2. **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run **simultaneously**.
3. Fabricate begins only after both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines are complete.
4. **Quality_Check** and **Create_Documentation** begin **in parallel** right after Fabricate.
5. Package starts when both Quality_Check and Create_Documentation are finished.
6. Dispatch_to_Customer follows Package.
7. Close_Work_Order completes the process.

From the given information, we can see that there are two instances where tasks are executed in parallel:
1. **Procure_Materials** and **Schedule_Machines** start after Create_Work_Order and run simultaneously.
2. **Quality_Check** and **Create_Documentation** begin in parallel right after Fabricate.

Therefore, the pairs of tasks that can be executed in parallel in Process B are:
- Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines
- Quality_Check and Create_Documentation

To present these pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in the overall list, we format them as follows:
- Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
- Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines

So, the list of pairs in the required format is:

```
Create_Documentation  —  Quality_Check
Procure_Materials  —  Schedule_Machines
```
