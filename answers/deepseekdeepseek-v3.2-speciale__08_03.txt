Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

The shortest firing sequence (length 4) is:

**T1, T2b, T4, T5**

After firing T1, we have tokens in `pa` and `pb`.  
- Firing T2b consumes `pa` and produces `pd`.  
- Firing T4 consumes `pb` and produces `pe`.  
Now both `pd` and `pe` are present, enabling T5 to fire before any occurrence of T3.
