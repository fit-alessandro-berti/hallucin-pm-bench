Here's one improvement to bring the process into SLA:

1. Add a **timer boundary event** to Element ID Task_Check:  
   - Attach an **Intermediate Signal Catch Event** (ID: `Signal_ESC`) after Task_Check  
   - Add a flow from `Signal_ESC` to `GW_Docs`  
   - When documents are missing, Task_RequestDocs will auto-complete after 24-36 hours without human input  

2. Configure the timer:  
   ```bpmn:timerEventDefinition>`  
   Usable via execution.setVariable('autoEscalated', true) in Task_Triage  
   Reaches Task_Triage at 24h Â± 12h  

This meets SLA by forcing auto-escalation after 24-36h if docs aren't received, while utilizing only existing tasks.
