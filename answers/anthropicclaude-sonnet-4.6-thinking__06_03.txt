## Process B – Concurrent Task Sets

**Set 1 (Parallel Split #1 / Merge #1)**
- **Quality_Check**
- **Update_Inventory**

These two tasks are placed on separate branches that open at Parallel Split #1 and re-join at Merge #1, meaning they may execute simultaneously after **Receive_Stock** completes.

**Set 2 (Parallel Split #2 / Merge #2)**
- **Generate_Replenishment_Report**
- **Notify_Procurement**

These two tasks are placed on separate branches that open at Parallel Split #2 and re-join at Merge #2, meaning they may execute simultaneously after **Store_Items** completes.
