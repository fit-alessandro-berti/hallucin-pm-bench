Yes.

One concrete firing sequence from the initial marking:
- T1: p0 → p1 + p2  (marking: p1=1, p2=1)
- T2: p1 → p3        (marking: p3=1, p2=1, and p4=0)
- T5: p3 –|p4 → p6   (enabled because p3=1 and p4=0; marking: p6=1, p2=1)
- T3: p2 → p4        (marking: p6=1, p4=1)

Thus T5 fires before T3. Brief justification: After T1, T2 and T3 are concurrent. If T2 fires first, we get p3=1 while p4=0, satisfying T5’s inhibitor condition, so T5 can fire before T3. Note also that if T3 fires first, p4=1 disables T5 permanently (the only remover of p4 is T4, which would also consume p3), so the only way for T5 to ever occur is indeed before T3.
