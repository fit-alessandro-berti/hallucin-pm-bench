1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst who sees **only this snippet** might still misestimate how common manual fraud checks are in the full month-long log if they mistakenly group appearances of **“Manual Review”** and **“Manual Fraud Check”** together, assuming they are similarly performed. This could lead to underestimating the occurrence of **“Manual Fraud Check”**, as it appears less frequently compared to **“Manual Review”**. Also, if the analyst overlooks the context (outlier activities) and observes only successful, smooth case paths (e.g., case 1001 to 1003), they might conclude that manual fraud checks are unnecessary and rarely done, when in reality, they are often a critical step in less straightforward application processes.
