Subject: Bottlenecks breaching SLAs

Our worst-performing steps are Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment. Legal Approval averages 900s against a 600s SLA, exceeding by 300s, with the highest waiting time at 600s across 465 cases. Risk Review runs 600s versus a 300s SLA—300s over target—with 480s waiting time on 480 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s, 60s over its 240s SLA, with 200s waiting time across 1,175 cases. These prolonged waits are the primary drivers of SLA breaches.

Recommendations:  
- Legal Approval: Reprioritize queueing to cut the 600s average wait, focusing scarce capacity on this 465-case backlog to reduce the 300s SLA overrun.  
- Risk Review: Allocate faster triage or parallel reviews to shrink the 480s waiting time driving the 300s breach.  
- Credit Assessment: Smooth inflow from Verify Identity to lower the 200s wait that pushes throughput 60s over SLA.
