Here's an analysis of the Petri net, focusing on the firing order of T5 and T3:

**Analysis**

*   **T5 Dependencies:** T5 requires tokens in both `pd` and `pe` to fire.
*   **Token Flows:**
    *   A token in `p0` starts the process.
    *   `T1` splits the token into `pa` and `pb`.
    *   `T2` and `T2b` consume the token in `pa`, but only one of them may fire.
    *   `T4` consumes the token in `pb` to produce a token in `pe`.
    *   If `T2` fires, its output `pc` can only be consumed by T3 to put a token in `pd`.
    *   If `T2b` fires, it produces a token in `pd` directly.

*   **T3 and T5 Ordering:**
    *   `T3` needs a token in `pc`. `pc` only gets a token after `T2` fires.
    *   `T5` requires both `pd` and `pe`. `pe` comes from `T4`. `pd` comes from either `T2` through `T3` or `T2b`.
    *   If `T2` and then `T3` happens before `T5` then `T5` has both `pd` and `pe`.
    *   If `T2b` happens before `T3`, then `T5` can occur before `T3`.

**Answer**

Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Shortest Firing Sequence:**

1.  `T1`
2.  `T2b`
3.  `T4`
4.  `T5`
