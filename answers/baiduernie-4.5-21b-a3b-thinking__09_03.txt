### Response
We cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval for the activity "Approve Invoice" because **the event-log data has been redacted, leaving only the header with no actual timestamps or values for start/complete times**. Artefact B provides historical averages and SLA targets but does not include granular data for the "Approve Invoice" activity in the supplied log. Without raw data, no statistical calculations can be performed.
