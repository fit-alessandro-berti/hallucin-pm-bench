Let me analyze the process narrative and create a RACI matrix using the authorized vocabulary.

First, I'll identify all the activities mentioned in the process narrative and map them to the authorized vocabulary:

1. **Preliminary Assessment** -> **Intake Vetting**
2. **Customer Due Diligence (CDD)** -> **KYC Review**
3. **Sanctions Check** -> **AML Screening**
4. **Risk rating** on a 0-100 scale -> **Risk Scoring**
5. Approval (by Compliance Officer)
6. Scheduling payment (by Treasury Ops)
7. Releasing funds (by Treasury Ops)
8. Notifying the originating analyst (by Treasury Ops)

Now, I'll map these to the roles mentioned:
- Front-Office Analyst
- Compliance Analyst
- Compliance Officer
- Treasury Ops

Let me create the RACI matrix:

For **Intake Vetting**:
- Responsible: Front-Office Analyst (they perform this activity)
- Accountable: Front-Office Analyst (they own this activity)
- Consulted: None (no one is consulted for this activity)
- Informed: None (no one is informed about this activity)

For **KYC Review**:
- Responsible: Compliance Analyst (they perform this activity)
- Accountable: Compliance Analyst (they own this activity)
- Consulted: None (no one is consulted for this activity)
- Informed: None (no one is informed about this activity)

For **AML Screening**:
- Responsible: Compliance Analyst (they perform this activity)
- Accountable: Compliance Analyst (they own this activity)
- Consulted: None (no one is consulted for this activity)
- Informed: None (no one is informed about this activity)

For **Risk Scoring**:
- Responsible: Compliance Analyst (they derive the risk score)
- Accountable: Compliance Analyst (they own this activity)
- Consulted: None (no one is consulted for this activity)
- Informed: None (no one is informed about this activity)

For **Approval**:
- Responsible: Compliance Officer (they grant approval)
- Accountable: Compliance Officer (they own this activity)
- Consulted: None (no one is consulted for this activity)
- Informed: Treasury Ops, Front-Office Analyst (they need to know about the approval)

For **Scheduling payment**:
- Responsible: Treasury Ops (they schedule the payment)
- Accountable: Treasury Ops (they own this activity)
- Consulted: None (no one is consulted for this activity)
- Informed: Compliance Officer (they need to know about the scheduled payment)

For **Releasing funds**:
- Responsible: Treasury Ops (they release the funds)
- Accountable: Treasury Ops (they own this activity)
- Consulted: None (no one is consulted for this activity)
- Informed: Compliance Officer, Front-Office Analyst (they need to know about the released funds)

For **Notifying the originating analyst**:
- Responsible: Treasury Ops (they notify the analyst)
- Accountable: Treasury Ops (they own this activity)
- Consulted: None (no one is consulted for this activity)
- Informed: None (no one is informed about this notification)

Now, I'll create the Markdown table:
# RACI Matrix for Wire-Transfer Request Process

| Activity | Front-Office Analyst | Compliance Analyst | Compliance Officer | Treasury Ops |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Intake Vetting** | R, A | | | I |
| **KYC Review** | | R, A | | |
| **AML Screening** | | R, A | | |
| **Risk Scoring** | | R, A | | |
| Approval (when score >70) | | | R, A | |
| Schedule Payment (when score â‰¤70) | | | | R, A |
| Release Funds | | | | R, A |
| Notify Originating Analyst | | | | R, A |

Legend:  
- **R** = Responsible (performs the task)
- **A** = Accountable (owns the task)
- **I** = Informed (receives updates about the task)
