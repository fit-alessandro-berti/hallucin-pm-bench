**Q1:** How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?  
There are **6 distinct cases**: C001, C002, C003, and C001, C002, C003 appear once each, with no duplicates beyond existing consecutive entries — thus all cases are unique:  
**C001, C002, C003** → total = **3 distinct cases** (each appears multiple times but counted once).
