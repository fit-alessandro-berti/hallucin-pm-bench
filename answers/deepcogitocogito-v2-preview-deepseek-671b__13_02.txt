Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one based on the provided log data.

**Question 1: How many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in the excerpt?**

Scanning through the log entries, I need to look for the exact activity name "**Manual_Fraud_Check**". 

Looking through each line, I see:

- C05 | **Manual_Fraud_Check**| 2025-03-05T14:47:50Z

That's the only occurrence. All other fraud checks are "Auto_Fraud_Check". So, the count is 1.

**Question 2a: What percentage of all events include that activity?**

Total events in the log: There are 12 cases, each with 4 events. 12 * 4 = 48 events.

Number of events with "Manual_Fraud_Check": 1

Percentage = (1 / 48) * 100 = 2.08%, which rounds to 2.08% (since we need two decimal places; 2.08 is already at two decimals).

**Question 2b: What percentage of all unique cases (12 in total) include that activity?**

Total unique cases: 12

Number of cases that include "Manual_Fraud_Check": Only case C05 has this activity.

Percentage = (1 / 12) * 100 = 8.33% (rounded to two decimal places).

**Question 3: Explain in ≤100 words why a low-support activity like this can mislead analyses if generalized.**

If an activity occurs very rarely (like Manual_Fraud_Check here), generalizing from this sample could be misleading. For instance, predictive models might overfit to this rare event, making it seem more significant than it is in the broader process. Performance analyses might inaccurately estimate the frequency or impact of such activities, leading to wrong conclusions about process bottlenecks or resource allocations. Relying on this small slice could make sporadic tasks appear as common practice, distorting process understanding and leading to suboptimal decisions once scaled to the entire dataset.
**Answers**

1. **Manual_Fraud_Check** occurs **1** time in the log.  

2. a) **2.08%** of all *events* (1 out of 48 events)  
   b) **8.33%** of all *unique cases* (1 out of 12 cases)  

3. A low-support activity like Manual_Fraud_Check (occurring only once) can skew analysis if assumed representative. If generalized, predictive models might overemphasize its importance, leading to overfitting. Process performance metrics (e.g., fraud-check time) may misrepresent typical cases, as nearly all use Auto_Fraud_Check. Such sampling bias risks misallocating resources and drawing incomplete conclusions when scaling from this small slice to entire operations.
