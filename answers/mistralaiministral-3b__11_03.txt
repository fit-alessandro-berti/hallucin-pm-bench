**Executive Memo**

Dear COO,

I have analyzed the process performance data for Orion Credit's activities. The three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches and high waiting times are:

- **Credit Assessment**: This activity exceeds its SLA by 160% (300s - 240s = 60s) and has an average waiting time of 200 seconds.
- **Legal Approval**: This activity exceeds its SLA by 130% (900s - 600s = 300s) and has an average waiting time of 600 seconds.
- **Risk Review**: This activity exceeds its SLA by 130% (600s - 300s = 300s) and has an average waiting time of 480 seconds.

**Recommendations:**

- **Credit Assessment**: Implement a priority system based on risk level to expedite high-risk assessments.
- **Legal Approval**: Streamline the approval process by utilizing digital signatures and reducing manual review steps.
- **Risk Review**: Consider outsourcing risk reviews to specialized firms to reduce waiting times and improve efficiency.

Best regards,
Orion Credit's Senior Process-Performance Analyst
