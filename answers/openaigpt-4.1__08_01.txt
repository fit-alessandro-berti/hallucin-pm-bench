### **Restating the Question**

Given the Petri net described:  
**Is it possible for T5 to fire *before* T3 (i.e., with T5 occurring in a firing sequence before the first occurrence of T3), in any reachable marking?**

---

### **Step 1: Understanding Transitions and Token Flow**

#### **Initial marking:**
- p0: 1
- All other places: 0

#### **Transitions**
- **T1:** p0 → (p1 + p2) *[After: p1=1, p2=1]*
- **T2:** p1 → p3       *[Consumes from p1, puts into p3]*
- **T3:** p2 → p4       *[Consumes from p2, puts into p4]*
- **T4:** p3 + p4 → p5   *[Consumes both, puts into p5]*
- **T5:** normal arc from p3, inhibitor arc from p4 → p6  
  *(Can fire iff p3=1 and p4=0)*

### **Step 2: Firing Sequence Possibilities**

Only T1 is enabled at start.

#### **Marking after T1:**
- p1: 1, p2: 1

Now,
- T2 is enabled (p1=1)
- T3 is enabled (p2=1)

##### Both can fire in any order.

#### **Case A: Could T5 fire before T3?**

***To fire T5:***
- p3 must be 1
- p4 must be 0

***But to get a token in p3:***  
T2 must have fired (consumes p1, puts 1 in p3)

Let’s **try to enable T5 as soon as possible**, *but* without firing T3 yet.

**Sequence:**
1. T1: [p1=1, p2=1]
2. T2: [p1=0, p2=1, p3=1]
    - Now: p3=1, p4=0
    - **T5 is enabled**! (since p3=1 and p4=0, inhibitor satisfied)
3. So, **T5 can fire here before T3!**

- After T5: p3=0, p4=0, p6=1, p2=1

**Therefore: Yes, T5 *can* fire before T3!**

---

### **Step 3: Concrete Sequence**

**A firing sequence from initial marking where T5 fires before T3:**

1. T1  (p0:1 → p1:1, p2:1)
2. T2  (p1:1 → p3:1, p2:1)
3. T5  (p3:1 + p4:0 → p6:1, p2:1) *(T5 fires, p3=0, p4=0, p2=1, p6=1)*

**Justification:**  
After (T1, T2), we have p3=1 and p4=0, so T5 is enabled and can fire *before* T3.

You can then fire T3 if you wish, but the requirement was only that T5 fires before T3.

---

## **Final Answer**

**Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.**

**Example firing sequence:**

 T1, T2, T5

**Proof:**  
After firing T1 and T2, p3=1, p4=0, so T5 is enabled and can fire before T3 has fired at all.
