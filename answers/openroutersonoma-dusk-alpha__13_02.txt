### 3. Explanation of Misleading Impact
In this log slice, "Manual_Fraud_Check" has low support (1 event, 1 case), yet it precedes a successful payout in C05. Generalizing could mislead by overemphasizing rare manual interventions as key to approvals, inflating their perceived performance impact (e.g., cycle time or success rate) or predictive value (e.g., as a signal for positive outcomes). This ignores the dominant auto-check patterns, leading to biased models or inefficient process optimizations in broader data. (62 words)
