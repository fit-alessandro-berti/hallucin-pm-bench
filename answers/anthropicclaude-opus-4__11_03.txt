TO: Chief Operating Officer  
FROM: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
RE: Critical Performance Issues - Credit Application Process

Our analysis reveals three activities requiring immediate intervention based on SLA violations and excessive waiting times:

**Legal Approval** exhibits the most severe performance gap, with average throughput time of 900 seconds exceeding its 600-second SLA by 50%. The 600-second waiting time represents 67% of total processing time.

**Risk Review** significantly breaches its 300-second SLA, operating at 600 seconds (100% over target). With 480 seconds in waiting time, resources are idle 80% of the activity duration.

**Credit Assessment** runs at 300 seconds against a 240-second SLA (25% breach), with 200 seconds waiting time comprising 67% of the cycle.

**Recommendations:**
• **Legal Approval**: Implement parallel review processes to reduce the 600-second queue time
• **Risk Review**: Add dedicated resources to address the 480-second waiting backlog affecting 480 cases
• **Credit Assessment**: Automate initial screening to minimize the 200-second wait period impacting 1,175 cases
