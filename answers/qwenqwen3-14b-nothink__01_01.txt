### **Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process**

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision:** Is the claim eligible based on the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?  
   - **Outcome:** If eligible, proceeds to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**; otherwise, the process may terminate or be redirected (not explicitly defined in the process steps).

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   - **Decision:** Has the finance controller approved the claim using the *EligibilityChecklist*?  
   - **Outcome:** If approved, proceeds to the next step; otherwise, the process may be rejected or paused.

3. **High-value branch – Senior_Auditor_Review** (conditional)  
   - **Decision:** Is the refund amount **greater than €1,000**?  
   - **Outcome:** If yes, the case must proceed to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (requires *AuditTrail*); if no, skips to **Process_Refund_Payment**.

4. **Process_Refund_Payment** (conditional dependencies)  
   - **Decision:** Are both **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** and **Senior_Auditor_Review** (if applicable) completed?  
   - **Outcome:** If yes, **Process_Refund_Payment** can begin; otherwise, it cannot start.
