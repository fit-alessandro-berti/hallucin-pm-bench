Based solely on Process B - Custom_Furniture_Manufacturing, here are the sets of tasks that may execute concurrently:

1. Generate_CAD_Drawing, Confirm_Materials_Availability
2. Milling_Panels, Turning_Legs, CNC_Detailing
3. Sand_Surfaces, Apply_Stain, Install_Hardware

These represent the three parallel blocks (P1, P2, and P3) identified in the Custom Furniture Manufacturing process where tasks can run concurrently rather than sequentially.
