**Worst-Performing Activities:**  
1. **Review_Documents** (SLA breach: 12.4%, processing time: 25 min, stdev: 9 min). High SLA breaches and variability indicate inconsistent, delayed processing.  
2. **Request_Documents** (Rework rate: 22%, wait time: 150 min). Excessive rework and long queues suggest inefficiencies in initial data collection or communication.  
3. **Initial_Assessment** (SLA breach: 3.2%, wait time: 18 min). Moderate SLA breaches and elevated wait times point to bottlenecks in resource allocation or task prioritization.  

**Recommendations:**  
- **Review_Documents**: Redesign workflow to standardize document evaluation, reducing variability and accelerating SLA compliance.  
- **Request_Documents**: Introduce automated document tracking systems to minimize rework and shorten wait times.  
- **Initial_Assessment**: Allocate additional staff during peak periods to decrease wait times and improve SLA adherence.
