## Analysis

**Answer: No, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.**

**Explanation:**
- T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5 simultaneously to fire
- P5 can only receive a token via T4, which requires a token in P4
- P4 receives tokens from either T3 (from P2) or T7 (from P3 via T2)
- The AND-split in T1 ensures a single token in P2 initially
- If T5 fires, it consumes the token from P2, making T3 impossible to fire afterward
- Any sequence enabling T5 (T1→T2→T7→T4) requires T3 to have already fired to free P4 for T4, and T3 cannot fire after T5 consumes P2

**Bonus:** No minimal sequence exists because the condition is structurally impossible in this Petri net.
