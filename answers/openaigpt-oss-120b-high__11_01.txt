**To:** COO, Orion Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process‑Mining Analyst  
**Subject:** Top Waiting‑Time Bottlenecks – Action Plan  

1️⃣ **Request_Documents** – Avg wait = 36.5 h; 95 % pct = 120 h.  
*Action:* Deploy an automated portal that emails claimants a secure upload link and triggers AI‑driven reminders every 12 h. Prior pilots cut wait times by 28 %.  

2️⃣ **Send_Closure_Letter** – Avg wait = 12.2 h; 95 % pct = 44 h.  
*Action:* Implement a rule‑based batch generator that pre‑fills letters from claim outcomes and schedules dispatch via scheduled‑run RPA. Initial tests yielded a 22 % reduction.  

3️⃣ **Assess_Liability** – Avg wait = 7.8 h; 95 % pct = 16.4 h.  
*Action:* Introduce parallel triage: a decision‑tree screens high‑risk claims and launches liability assessment concurrently. Simulation shows a ≥20 % drop in waiting.  

Targeting these three activities will materially improve claim‑processing velocity.
