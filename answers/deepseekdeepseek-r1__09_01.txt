1) The average cycle time for "Review Contract" **cannot be derived** from the provided log.  

2) **Explanation**:  
The log contains only activity names, case IDs, and resources â€“ **no timestamp or elapsed-time data** is provided to calculate durations. The historical benchmark metrics reference a different customer segment and explicitly state they are **not derived from this log**, making them irrelevant for this analysis. Without duration measurements for "Review Contract" in the log, computation is impossible.
