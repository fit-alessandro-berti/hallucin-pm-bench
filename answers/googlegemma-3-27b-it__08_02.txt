**Question 1:** Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Question 2:** A minimal firing sequence demonstrating this is: **T1, T2, T4, T5**. 

Here's why: T1 fires, creating tokens in P1 and P2. T2 fires, consuming the token in P1. T4 fires consuming the token in P4 (which requires T1 and T2 to have fired first). This places a token in P5. Finally, as T5 requires tokens in *both* P2 and P5, and P2 already has a token from the initial firing of T1, T5 can fire *before* T3, which only consumes the token in P2.
