**Yes – T5 can fire before T3.**  

### Concrete firing sequence from the initial marking  

| Step | Firing transition | Marking after the step (p0…p6) |
|------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | – (initial)       | (1,0,0,0,0,0,0)                |
| 1    | **T1**            | (0,1,1,0,0,0,0)                |
| 2    | **T2**            | (0,0,1,1,0,0,0)                |
| 3    | **T5**            | (0,0,1,0,0,0,1)                |

*Explanation*  

1. **T1** consumes the token in p0 and creates one token each in p1 and p2.  
2. **T2** consumes the token in p1 and puts a token in p3. At this point p4 still holds **zero** tokens (T3 has not fired).  
3. **T5** has a normal input arc from p3 (so it needs a token there) **and** an inhibitor arc “–|p4”, which requires that p4 be empty. Both conditions are satisfied, so T5 fires, consuming the p3‑token and producing a token in p6.

Thus T5 fires **before** any occurrence of T3.

### Why this is the only way T5 can ever fire  

- T5’s inhibitor arc forces p4 to be empty. As soon as T3 fires, a token appears in p4 and T5 becomes permanently disabled.  
- Therefore, if T5 is to fire at all, it must do so **before** T3. The sequence above shows that the net indeed allows exactly that situation.  

So the answer to the question is **yes** – a reachable marking exists (the one after step 2) in which T5 can fire, and the sequence *T1, T2, T5* demonstrates it.
