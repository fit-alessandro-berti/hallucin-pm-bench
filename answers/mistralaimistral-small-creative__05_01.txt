Add a **boundary timer event** (`id="Timer_Escalate"`) to the **"Check Completeness"** task (`Task_Check`). Configure it to trigger after **48 hours** with a default flow to a new **"Escalate Claim"** task (reusing `Task_RequestDocs` with a modified name/description via `documentation` attribute). Connect the timer’s interrupting flow (`id="f10"`) to `Task_RequestDocs` (now repurposed for escalation). This ensures auto-escalation if the claim isn’t triaged within the SLA, while preserving existing flows. No new tasks are added—just a timer and flow redirection.
