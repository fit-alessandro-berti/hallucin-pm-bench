No

The claim is false: in case C003 (lines 6–7) Validate_Payment occurs at 2025-02-01T10:43 (line 6) before Receive_Order at 10:45 (line 7), and in case C005 (lines 11–12) Validate_Payment appears (line 11) with no Receive_Order in that case, so Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order.
