To compute the average cycle time of the activity "Approve Invoice" from the event log, we need to identify the start and completion times of each "Approve Invoice" activity. The event log provided does not contain the actual timestamps, but we can infer that the start time of the "Approve Invoice" activity is the "start_time" and the completion time is the "complete_time" for each case.

However, we cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or a 95% confidence interval without the actual timestamps. The event log does not provide the necessary data to calculate these metrics. The provided information is insufficient to perform the required calculations.
