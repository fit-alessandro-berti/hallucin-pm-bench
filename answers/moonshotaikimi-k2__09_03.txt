I cannot compute the requested metrics.

Reason: Artefact A contains only column headers; all timestamp data—both start_time and complete_time for every “Approve Invoice” event—have been redacted. Without at least these two timestamps for the relevant activity instances, I lack the absolute minimum input required to calculate any actual duration, let alone its mean, standard deviation, or confidence interval.
