To ensure the process meets the SLA without adding new tasks, introduce a **boundary timer event** on the **Task_Check** (ID: `Task_Check`). This timer should trigger after 48 hours, and it should be connected to the **Task_Triage** (ID: `Task_Triage`) via a sequence flow. This way, if the claim is not triaged within 48 hours, it will automatically escalate to the triage step, adhering to the SLA requirement.

The boundary timer event should be configured to interrupt the current activity, ensuring the claim does not get stuck in the check phase. This modification leverages existing tasks and introduces minimal changes to the process flow.
