To help bring the "FastClaimOnboarding" process into SLA:

Attach an interrupting timer boundary event (e.g., `BE_Timer_Request_SLA`) to `Task_RequestDocs`. Set its duration to a threshold (e.g., 36 hours) that allows time for prior steps (`Task_Receive`, `Task_Check`) within the overall 48-hour SLA.
If `Task_RequestDocs` exceeds this duration, `BE_Timer_Request_SLA` fires, interrupting `Task_RequestDocs`.
The sequence flow from `BE_Timer_Request_SLA` should lead to a new Intermediate Throw Escalation event (e.g., `Evt_Escalate_Docs_Delay`) to signal the "auto-escalation". Subsequently, flow from `Evt_Escalate_Docs_Delay` directly to `Task_Triage`.
This ensures claims are escalated and move to `Task_Triage` without undue delay if document submission is slow, helping meet the 48-hour requirement.
