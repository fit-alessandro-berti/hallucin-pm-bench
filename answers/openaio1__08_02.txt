Answer 1: Yes, it is possible.

Answer 2 (minimal firing sequence):  
T1 → T2 → T7 → T4 → T5  

Explanation (≤120 words):  
After T1, the net has tokens in P1 and P2. Then T2 moves the P1 token to P3. T7 passes it on to P4, and T4 takes the token from P4 to P5. Now P2 and P5 both have tokens simultaneously, enabling T5. At this point, T3 has not yet fired, so T5 fires before T3.
