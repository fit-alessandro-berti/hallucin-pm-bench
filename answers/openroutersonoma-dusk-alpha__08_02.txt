**Question 1:** No.

**Question 2:** No such sequence exists. T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5 to fire. To reach P5, T4 must fire, which requires P4 to have a token. The only way to get a token in P4 is via T7 (from P3) or T3 (from P2). Firing T3 consumes the token in P2. Thus, after T3 fires, P2 is empty, making it impossible to have tokens in both P2 and P5 simultaneously for T5 to fire. Therefore, T5 cannot fire before T3 in any reachable marking.
