1️⃣ The exact activity string **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **1** time in this excerpt.

2️⃣ An analyst might misestimate how common manual fraud checks are because this snippet is very small, covering only three cases and less than two hours of a single day. The observed frequency of manual fraud checks (1 out of 3 cases) in this limited sample might not be representative of the entire month. A full month's log could reveal different patterns based on varying times, days, or a wider range of application characteristics not present here, potentially showing manual checks to be significantly more or less frequent. The small sample size increases the risk of skew due to random variation or unobserved factors.
