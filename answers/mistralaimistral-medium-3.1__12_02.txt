The fact is inaccurate because in **Case C003** (lines 6â€“7), *Validate_Payment* occurs **before** *Receive_Order*, violating the claimed "always follows" rule. While most cases (C001, C002, C004) show *Validate_Payment* after *Receive_Order*, the log fragment explicitly disproves the universal assertion.
