We need to analyze Petri net PN-8.

Given initial marking M0 = { P0 }.

Places: P0 (1), P1 (0), P2 (0), P3 (0), P4 (0), P5 (0), P6 (0).

Transitions:

T1: pre-set: { P0 } → post-set: { P1, P2 }  (AND-split)
T2: pre-set: { P1 } → post-set: { P3 }
T7: pre-set: { P3 } → post-set: { P4 }
T3: pre-set: { P2 } → post-set: { P4 }
T4: pre-set: { P4 } → post-set: { P5 }
T5: pre-set: { P2, P5 } → post-set: { P6 }  (synchronising join)
T6? Not given. Possibly missing T6? Actually net includes T6? Not needed.

Goal: Determine if T5 can fire before T3.

We need to consider reachable markings from M0. T5 requires tokens in both P2 and P5 simultaneously.

T5 pre: P2 (requires a token) and P5 (requires a token). T5 consumes both tokens and produces token in P6.

T3 pre: P2. T3 consumes token from P2 and puts token in P4.

Thus T5 requires token in P2 and P5. Initially no tokens.

Sequence possibilities:

M0: P0=1.

First, T1 can fire (since P0 has token). After T1 fires: P0=0, P1=1, P2=1.

Now we have tokens: P1=1, P2=1.

From there, we can fire T2 (consume P1, produce P3). Also can fire T3 (consume P2, produce P4). Also maybe fire T7 after T2, etc.

Goal: T5 before T3. T5 requires P5 token, which is produced by T4. T4 requires P4 token. P4 token can be produced by T3 or T7. So to get P5 token, we need to produce P4 token, then fire T4 (P4->P5). However T5 also requires P2 token.

Thus to fire T5 before T3, we must produce P5 token without consuming the P2 token that T3 would later need (i.e., we need to keep P2 token for T5). So we need to have P2 token present while also having P5 token. So we need to generate P4 token via some path that doesn't consume P2 token (i.e., via T7 after T2). Because T3 consumes P2. So we need to avoid firing T3.

Thus the plan: After T1, we have P1 and P2 tokens. Fire T2 (consume P1, produce P3). Then fire T7 (consume P3, produce P4). Then fire T4 (consume P4, produce P5). Now we have P2 token still present (since we haven't fired T3) and P5 token. So we can fire T5 (consume P2 and P5, produce P6). This would be T5 before T3. However we must check if any constraints: T5 also requires P2 token, which we have. So yes, T5 can fire before T3.

Thus answer to Q1: Yes.

Now Q2: Provide a minimal firing sequence that demonstrates T5 before T3.

Potential minimal sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Check: Starting M0 = {P0}.

Fire T1: consumes P0, produces P1, P2. Marking: P1=1, P2=1.

Fire T2: consumes P1, produces P3. Marking: P2=1, P3=1.

Fire T7: consumes P3, produces P4. Marking: P2=1, P4=1.

Fire T4: consumes P4, produces P5. Marking: P2=1, P5=1.

Now fire T5: consumes P2 and P5, produces P6. Marking: P6=1.

Thus T5 fired after T1, T2, T7, T4, and before any firing of T3. Indeed T3 not fired. So the sequence is minimal? Could we remove any transition? Could we skip T2? T2 is required to produce P3 for T7. Could we produce P4 via T3 (but that would consume P2). That would preclude T5. So need T2 and T7. Could we skip T1? No, because initial token is P0. So minimal sequence is indeed [T1, T2, T7, T4, T5].

Thus answer: Yes, T5 can fire before T3, with minimal firing sequence T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

We need to keep explanation ≤120 words.

Let's craft final answer succinctly.

Word count: We'll keep under 120.

Answer: Yes. After T1 we have tokens in P1 and P2. Fire T2 (P1→P3), then T7 (P3→P4), then T4 (P4→P5). Now we still hold a token in P2, and have a token in P5, so T5 (requires P2 and P5) can fire before any T3. Minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Check length: Let's count words.

"Yes." (1) "After" (2) "T1" (3) "we" (4) "have" (5) "tokens" (6) "in" (7) "P1" (8) "and" (9) "P2." (10) "Fire" (11) "T2" (12) "(P1→P3)," (13) "then" (14) "T7" (15) "(P3→P4)," (16) "then" (17) "T4" (18) "(P4→P5)." (19) "Now" (20) "we" (21) "still" (22) "hold" (23) "a" (24) "token" (25) "in" (26) "P2," (27) "and" (28) "have" (29) "a" (30) "token" (31) "in" (32) "P5," (33) "so" (34) "T5" (35) "(requires" (36) "P2" (37) "and" (38) "P5)" (39) "can" (40) "fire" (41) "before" (42) "any" (43) "T3." (44) "Minimal" (45) "firing" (46) "sequence:" (47) "T1," (48) "T2," (49) "T7," (50) "T4," (51) "T5." (52)

That's 52 words, well under 120.

Thus answer is fine.

We must answer Q1 and Q2 (bonus). Provide answer accordingly.

Now ensure we format properly.

We can answer:

**Answer 1:** Yes.

**Answer 2:** Minimal firing sequence: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.

Explain reasoning within limit.

We can also mention that T5 can fire before T3 because we can produce P5 via the path T2 → T7 → T4 without consuming P2, leaving P2 for T5.

Thus final answer.

Will produce final output.

**Answer 1:** Yes.  

**Answer 2 (minimal sequence):** T1, T2, T7, T4, T5.  

After T1 we have tokens in P1 and P2. Firing T2 (P1→P3) and then T7 (P3→P4) creates a token in P4; T4 (P4→P5) supplies the token in P5. The token in P2 remains untouched, so T5 (which needs P2 and P5) can fire before any occurrence of T3.
