I'll analyze Acme Bank's small-business loan-approval process systematically to answer both questions.

## a) Decision Points (Gates and Conditional Branches)

**Decision Point 1: Conditional Skip After Tri-Color-Risk-Check (between Steps 3 and 5)**
- **Rule:** If the risk rating outcome is Low or Medium AND the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, then Manual-Underwriting-Review (Step 5) is skipped; otherwise, the application must proceed through Manual-Underwriting-Review.

**Decision Point 2: TriVote Decision-Gate (Step 6)**
- **Rule:** The application requires input from three roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer), and passes if any two out of these three provide approval; if fewer than two approve, the application does not pass.

## b) Documents Required (in order of first appearance)

| Order | Document Name | First Appears At |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Form 14B** | Step 1 (Receive-Application) |
| 2 | **Scorecard–Cyan** | Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) |
| 3 | **Scorecard–Magenta** | Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) |
| 4 | **Scorecard–Yellow** | Step 3 (Tri-Color-Risk-Check) |
| 5 | **Deck Memo** | Step 5 (Manual-Underwriting-Review) |
| 6 | **Offer Sheet 77** | Step 7 (Prepare-Binding-Offer) |
| 7 | **ID Matrix Declaration** | Step 8 (Request-Applicant-Confirmation) |
| 8 | **Loan Dossier 2025** | Step 9 (Finalize-Agreement) |

**Summary:** The process contains exactly **2 decision points** and requires **8 distinct documents** throughout the loan approval workflow.
