1) The requested value cannot be derived.  
2) The provided event log does not include timestamps or elapsed-time fields for any activities (these have been explicitly redacted in the data), which are required to calculate cycle time or duration for "Review Contract." The historical benchmarks are from a different fiscal year and customer segment, so they cannot be applied here.
