Add an **intermediate timer event** (boundary event) to "Task_Check" (or "GW_Docs") with a **48-hour time-out**, routing to "Task_Triage" (via a new conditional flow using the timeout event). This ensures SLA compliance by bypassing "Task_RequestDocs" if the claim document check hasnâ€™t resolved within the deadline.

Alternatively, add a **conditional sequence flow** from "Task_Check" directly to "Task_Triage" with a timer condition (e.g., `[time > 48h]`) while preserving the existing flows.

Both approaches enforce the SLA by prioritizing timely triage, even for incomplete claims. Referenced elements: `Task_Check`, `GW_Docs`, and `Task_Triage`. (~120 words)

**Proposed XML addition** (simplified):
```xml
<bpmn:boundaryEvent attachedToRef="Task_Check" id="TimerCheck">
  <bpmn:timerEventDefinition><bpmn:timeDuration>P2DT</bpmn:timeDuration></bpmn:timerEventDefinition>
</bpmn:boundaryEvent>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow sourceRef="TimerCheck" targetRef="Task_Triage" id="f10"/>
```
