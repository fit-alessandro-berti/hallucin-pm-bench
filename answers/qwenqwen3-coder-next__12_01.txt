No, the fact is not accurate.

The claim states that **“Authorize_Refund” always occurs immediately before “Update_Inventory”** within the same case. However:

- In **Case 1001**, the sequence is:  
  `… → Update_Inventory (08:25:55) → Authorize_Refund (08:30:02)`  
  Here, *Update_Inventory occurs before* Authorize_Refund—not the reverse.

- In **Case 1002**, **Update_Inventory does not occur at all**, and the sequence is:  
  `… → Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued`  
  So Authorize_Refund does not precede Update_Inventory here (it does not occur).

- In **Case 1003**, the sequence is:  
  `… → Update_Inventory (10:08:07) → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund (10:22:18)`  
  Again, *Update_Inventory occurs before* Authorize_Refund.

Thus, in all cases where both activities appear (1001 and 1003), *Update_Inventory precedes* Authorize_Refund—not the reverse.
