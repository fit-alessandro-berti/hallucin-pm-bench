**Memo**

To: COO, Orion Insurance  
From: Senior Process-Mining Analyst  

Subject: Recommendations to Improve Process Performance  

Based on waiting-time data, the three worst-performing activities are:
1. Request_Documents: Avg Wait 36.5h, 95p Wait 120.0h
2. Send_Closure_Letter: Avg Wait 12.2h, 95p Wait 44.0h
3. Initial_Screening: Avg Wait 2.1h, 95p Wait 5.6h  

To reduce waiting times by ≥20%, I recommend:
1. Request_Documents: Implement automated document retrieval systems.
2. Send_Closure_Letter: Streamline approval processes for closure letters.
3. Initial_Screening: Utilize predictive analytics for faster screening decisions.  

These actions will enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction. Thank you.  

Please let me know if you need further details.
