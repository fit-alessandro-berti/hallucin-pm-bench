Analysis of process data identifies Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment as the three worst-performing activities due to significant SLA breaches and excessive waiting times. Legal Approval exceeds its 600s Target_SLA by 300s, driven by the highest average waiting time of 600s. Risk Review also surpasses its 300s SLA by 300s, hindered by a 480s waiting time across 480 cases. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240s SLA by 60s, maintaining a waiting time of 200s for 1,175 cases. These three steps represent the primary bottlenecks where waiting times contribute most heavily to throughput delays.

Recommendations:
* Reduce the 600s waiting time in Legal Approval to align the 900s throughput time with the 600s SLA.
* Target the 480s waiting time in Risk Review to eliminate the 300s breach of the 300s target.
* Address the 200s waiting time in Credit Assessment to resolve its 60s exceedance of the 240s SLA.
