**Question 1:**
No, it is not possible for **T5** to fire before **T3** in any reachable marking.

**Explanation (â‰¤ 120 words):**
For **T5** to fire, **P2** and **P5** must be marked, as it is a synchronising join. To mark **P5**, **T4** must fire, which requires **P4** to be marked. **P4** can be marked either by **T3** via **P2** or by **T7** via **P3**. For **P2** to be marked, **T1** must fire, which also enables **P1**. However, **P3** (required for **P4** via **T7**) can only be marked after **T2** fires, which depends on **P1**. Thus, **T3** must necessarily fire before **T5** can be enabled. No other firing sequence allows **T5** to precede **T3**, regardless of the marking.

**Question 2 (bonus):**
No sequence exists.
