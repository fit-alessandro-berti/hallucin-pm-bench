1) **The requested value cannot be derived.**

2) **Explanation:** The provided event log explicitly states that "timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted." Cycle time calculations require duration or start/end timestamps for each activity instance, which are absent from the `case_id`, `activity`, and `resource` columns provided. Additionally, the historical benchmark data is from a different customer segment and cannot be applied to this dataset.
