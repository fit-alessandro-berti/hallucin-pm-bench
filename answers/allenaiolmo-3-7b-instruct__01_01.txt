**Decision Points in Contoso Airlines’ Flight-Refund Process:**

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility:**  
   - Decide whether the passenger’s claim is eligible based on the FlightManifest and WeatherReport.

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove:**  
   - Decide to approve or reject the pre-approval based on the EligibilityChecklist.

3. **Senior_Auditor_Review_Required?:**  
   - Implicit decision (based on amount): If refund > €1 000, escalate to Senior_Auditor_Review; otherwise, proceed without.

4. **Senior_Auditor_Review_Completion:**  
   - Decision point on whether to proceed to payment only after Senior_Auditor_Review is successfully completed (for high-value claims).
