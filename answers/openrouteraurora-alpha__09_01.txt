**Answer:** The requested average cycle time for the activity “Review Contract” cannot be derived from the data that has been provided.

**Reasoning:**  
The event log excerpt lists only the case identifiers, activity names, and resources. The timestamps and elapsed‑time fields, which are necessary to calculate the duration of each “Review Contract” occurrence, have been redacted. Without those time values, it is impossible to compute the individual durations and therefore impossible to determine an average across the cases.
