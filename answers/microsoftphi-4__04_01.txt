Non-compliant.

1. Rule 3 is violated: The activity `Three_way_match` must occur within two activities after `Goods_Received`. In the trace, `Three_way_match` occurs four activities after `Goods_Received` (activities 6, 7, 8, and 10), which is beyond the allowed distance.

2. Rule 4 is violated: The activity executed by the role **Intern** ('Move_to_Quality' at #7) directly follows an activity by the role **CFO** ('Approve_PO_CFO' at #3). While not consecutive in the activity timeline, the sequence from `Issue_PO` to `Goods_Received` effectively allows an intern-initiated activity to follow soon after a CFO action, due to the absence of intervening non-Intern activities between `Issue_PO` and `Goods_Received`. The rule intends to prevent direct succession of actions by Interns immediately following CFO actions within the entire trace, considering practical causality.

These violations mean that Trace 24-EXP does not comply with the rule set P2P-2025.R1.
