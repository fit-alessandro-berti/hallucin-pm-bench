**MEMO TO COO – Q1-2025 CLAIMS BOTTLENECKS (≤200 words)**

Three activities choke cycle-time and customer experience:

1. Request_Documents  
   22 % of claims bounce back here (highest rework) and queue 150 min (longest wait).  
   Action: embed an AI checklist at first notice of loss; auto-cancel document task when evidence is already present in policy files.

2. Review_Documents  
   SLA breach 12.4 % (worst in chain) driven by 9-min σ—twice any other task—causing unpredictable staffing need.  
   Action: pilot straight-through processing rules for “clean” low-value claims (<$5 k, no injury) to remove ≥30 % of volume.

3. Initial_Assessment  
   3.2 % SLA breach, 18-min wait (second only to documents) with 1.8 % rework; indicates early triage gaps.  
   Action: introduce skills-based routing—complex/liability items to senior assessors—cutting reassignment and queue.

Together these three steps absorb 198 of the 226 total processing minutes; fixing them will compress end-to-end lead-time by an estimated 25 % without new headcount.
