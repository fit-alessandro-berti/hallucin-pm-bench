1. **No.**

2. **Justification (by cases and sequences):**
- **C001:** `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  - Here, **Validate_Payment immediately follows Receive_Order** (supports the claim).
- **C003:** `Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order`  
  - Here, **Validate_Payment immediately follows Receive_Order** (supports the claim).
- **C004:** `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  - **Counterexample:** **Check_Fraud occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment**, so Validate_Payment does **not** occur immediately after Receive_Order.
- **C002:** `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  - **Counterexample:** **Pack_Items occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment**, so Validate_Payment does **not** occur immediately after Receive_Order.

Because **C002 and C004** violate the “always immediately after” pattern, the FACT is not accurate for the excerpt.
