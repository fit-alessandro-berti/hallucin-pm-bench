We need to interpret the XES fragment. We need count distinct case IDs present. Those are C456, C123, C789. So answer: 3 distinct cases.

Second: For case C456, events are:

- Create_Order at 09:10:00+02:00
- Validate_Order at 09:20:00+02:00
- Pack_Items at 09:35:00+02:00
- Ship_Order at 09:40:00+02:00

Thus activity immediately preceding Ship_Order is Pack_Items.

Third: Which activity appears exactly once in the entire fragment? Let's count each activity across all cases.

Activities present:

- Validate_Order appears for C456 and C123? Actually check: C456 Validate_Order at 09:20:00, C123 Validate_Order at 09:05:00. So 2 occurrences.

- Pack_Items appears for C123 at 09:15:00 and for C456 at 09:35:00. So 2 occurrences.

- Cancel_Order appears for C789 at 09:45:00 only once? Wait also any other Cancel_Order? No. So appears exactly once.

- Ship_Order appears for C456 at 09:40:00 and for C123 at 09:25:00. So 2 occurrences.

- Create_Order appears for C123 at 09:00:00 and for C789 at 09:30:00 and C456 at 09:10:00. So 3 occurrences.

Thus the activity that appears exactly once is Cancel_Order.

Thus answers:

- 3 distinct cases
- The activity immediately preceding Ship_Order for case C456 is Pack_Items
- Cancel_Order appears exactly once.

Need bullet points.

Let's output bullet points with concise answers.

- 3 distinct cases (C123, C456, C789).  
- For case C456, the activity immediately before **Ship_Order** is **Pack_Items**.  
- The activity that appears exactly once in the fragment is **Cancel_Order**.
