**Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire before transition **T3**.

By taking the "shortcut" transition (**T2b**), the token in place **pa** can move directly to **pd**, bypassing **pc** and entirely avoiding the need to fire **T3**. 

One **shortest firing sequence** achieving this is:
**T1, T2b, T4, T5** 

*(Note: **T1, T4, T2b, T5** is also entirely valid as T2b and T4 are concurrent and independent).*

**Step-by-step token trace:**
1. **Initial:** `[p0 = 1]`
2. **Fire T1:** consumes `p0`, produces `pa` and `pb`. Marking: `[pa = 1, pb = 1]`
3. **Fire T2b:** consumes `pa`, produces `pd`. Marking: `[pd = 1, pb = 1]`
4. **Fire T4:** consumes `pb`, produces `pe`. Marking: `[pd = 1, pe = 1]`
5. **Fire T5:** consumes `pd` and `pe` (which are both available, and T3 has not fired). Marking: `[pf = 1]`
