 Replace sequence flow **f6** (from **Task_RequestDocs** to **Task_Triage**) with an **event‑based gateway** (e.g., **GW_Wait**). From **GW_Wait**, add two outgoing paths: (1) an **intermediate message catch event** (awaiting documents) that flows to **Task_Triage**; (2) an **intermediate timer catch event** set to **48 hours** that flows to a new **escalation end event** (e.g., **End_Escalation**). This cancels the token at **Task_Triage** if the deadline is breached, enforcing the SLA without extra tasks.
