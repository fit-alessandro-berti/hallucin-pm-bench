**MEMO**  

Orion Credit’s credit-application process shows significant bottlenecks in three critical activities. Risk Review has the largest SLA breach, averaging 600 seconds versus a 300-second target—an overrun of 300 seconds—and also exhibits the longest waiting time at 480 seconds. Legal Approval follows with a 900-second average against a 600-second SLA, exceeding by 300 seconds, and a 600-second wait. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds (300 seconds actual) and incurs 200 seconds of waiting. These delays cascade, inflating overall cycle times and eroding customer experience.  

**Recommendations:**  
- **Risk Review:** Reduce waiting time by parallelizing preliminary risk checks with identity verification to cut queue time.  
- **Legal Approval:** Automate standard clause generation to shorten processing from 900 to near-target duration.  
- **Credit Assessment:** Implement real-time scoring models to lower assessment time and waiting backlog.  

Addressing these will align performance with SLA targets and improve throughput.
