Yes, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3 in a reachable marking.

Shortest firing sequence:

1. T1
2. T2
3. T4
4. T5

Explanation:

*   **T1** fires, placing tokens on *pa* and *pb*.
*   **T2** fires, placing a token on *pc*.
*   **T4** fires, placing a token on *pe*.
*   **T5** fires, synchronizing the tokens on *pd* and *pe* and placing a token on *pf*.  Since *pd* and *pe* are both present (due to previous firing of T2 and T4), T5 can fire.
*   Since *pf* is now present, **T6** fires, placing a token on *pc*.
*   **T3** fires, placing a token on *pd*.

This sequence demonstrates that T5 can fire before T3, as there is a possible path from the initial marking (p0=1) that allows T5 to proceed to T6 before T3 is reached. Note: T3 is only reached via the path through T6.
