**Key:**  
- **R** = Responsible (performs the task)  
- **A** = Accountable (approves or owns outcome)  
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)  
- **I** = Informed (notified after completion)  

*Note: In this workflow, each activity is executed by a single role; therefore, only "R" is assigned per row, consistent with the described process responsibilities.*
