1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs **1 time** in the excerpt (Case C05).

2.  
a) Percentage of all *events* (48 total) that include “Manual_Fraud_Check”:  
   $ \frac{1}{48} \times 100 = 2.08\% $

b) Percentage of all *unique cases* (12 total) that include “Manual_Fraud_Check”:  
   $ \frac{1}{12} \times 100 = 8.33\% $

3. A low-support activity like “Manual_Fraud_Check” (1 occurrence) can mislead performance or predictive analyses because it may be treated as a rare exception, yet its presence could indicate a critical deviation (e.g., high-risk claim). If generalized, models might ignore such cases due to insufficient data, leading to poor detection of fraud patterns, biased process mining results, or failure to capture key decision points. Over-reliance on frequent paths may overlook rare but important deviations, reducing model robustness and real-world applicability.
