Based solely on the provided event-log fragment (18 lines), here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. Exactly how many times does the activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occur in this fragment?
The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time**.  
Reason: It appears only once, in the log line for case A1002 at timestamp 2025-05-01T10:50:00.

### 2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)
This represents **5.56%** of all logged events.  
Calculation:  
- Total logged events: 18  
- Occurrences of "Manual_Fraud_Check": 1  
- Percentage: (1 / 18) × 100 ≈ 5.555...%, rounded to two decimal places is **5.56%**.

### 3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.
The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is **A1002**.  
Reason: It is the only case where this activity is logged.

### 4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.
1. **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only 4 cases (A1001 to A1004), which is insufficient to capture the true variability and frequency of "Manual_Fraud_Check" in a month. With such a small sample, rare events may not be accurately represented, leading to high sampling error and unreliable estimates.  
2. **Limited time frame**: The data spans only about 5 hours on a single day (from 09:00 to 14:05 on 2025-05-01), which may not reflect typical daily or weekly patterns (e.g., fraud checks might vary by time of day, day of the week, or specific events). Estimating monthly frequency from such a short, non-representative period ignores potential temporal trends and biases the estimate.
