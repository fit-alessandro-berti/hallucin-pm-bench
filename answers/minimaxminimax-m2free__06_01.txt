We need to identify all pairs of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel, according to the description. The process description:

Process B – Manufacturing_WorkOrder:

1. Create_Work_Order
2. Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run simultaneously.
3. Fabricate begins only after both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines are complete.
4. Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel right after Fabricate.
5. Package starts when both Quality_Check and Create_Documentation are finished.
6. Dispatch_to_Customer follows Package.
7. Close_Work_Order completes the process.

Thus we need to list every pair of tasks that can be executed in parallel.

We need to interpret "parallel" meaning tasks that can be executed at the same time, i.e., concurrently, based on the process description. In process B, the description explicitly mentions that certain tasks may run simultaneously: "Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may start immediately after Create_Work_Order and may run simultaneously." Also, "Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel right after Fabricate." So those are the only pairs explicitly mentioned as parallel.

But the question asks: "List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." The description says that Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines may run simultaneously, and Quality_Check and Create_Documentation begin in parallel. Are there any other pairs? Possibly tasks that are not directly mentioned as parallel but could be executed concurrently given the process constraints? Let's examine.

We have a linear flow: Create_Work_Order -> (Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines) -> Fabricate -> (Quality_Check and Create_Documentation) -> Package -> Dispatch_to_Customer -> Close_Work_Order.

The tasks after Create_Work_Order are Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines, which can run simultaneously. Then after both are complete, Fabricate starts. So Fabricate cannot start until both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines are done; thus Fabricate cannot run in parallel with any of those two tasks. Similarly, Quality_Check and Create_Documentation start after Fabricate is complete, and they can run in parallel. So only those two pairs are parallel: Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines, and Quality_Check and Create_Documentation.

But the question says "List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." It might be that we need to list each unordered pair of tasks that can be parallel, not just the ones explicitly mentioned. However, there could be other pairs that can be executed in parallel if they are not dependent on each other. For example, after Create_Work_Order, both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines can start, so they are parallel. After Fabricate, Quality_Check and Create_Documentation are parallel. But could any other pair be parallel? For instance, after Create_Work_Order, could we also start Quality_Check or Create_Documentation? No, because Quality_Check and Create_Documentation depend on Fabricate which depends on both Procure_Materials and Schedule_Machines. So they cannot start before those are done. So they cannot be parallel with Create_Work_Order, etc.

Thus only the pairs (Procure_Materials, Schedule_Machines) and (Quality_Check, Create_Documentation). However, the question says "list every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." It might be that we need to list each pair of tasks that can be executed concurrently, even if they are not directly adjacent. For instance, tasks that are independent can be executed in parallel: maybe after Create_Work_Order, we can also start other tasks like Quality_Check? No, because Quality_Check requires Fabricate which requires Procurement and Scheduling. So no.

Thus only two pairs.

Now we need to return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in overall list. Alphabetical order within each pair: e.g., "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Materials"? Actually the tasks are "Procure_Materials" and "Schedule_Machines". Alphabetically, "Procure_Materials" (P) comes before "Schedule_Machines" (S). So the pair is "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines". For the second pair, "Quality_Check — Create_Documentation". Alphabetically, "Create_Documentation" (C) comes before "Quality_Check" (Q). Wait alphabetical order: "Create_Documentation" (C) < "Quality_Check" (Q). So we need to order them within each pair: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check". However the question says "Return the pairs in alphabetical order, both within each pair and in your overall list." So within each pair, we need to order tasks alphabetically. So the second pair should be "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check". The first pair is "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines". Now we need to order the pairs alphabetically as a whole. The first pair starts with "Procure_Materials". The second pair starts with "Create_Documentation". Alphabetically, "Create_Documentation" (C) < "Procure_Materials" (P). So the order should be:

Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

Thus output each pair on a separate line, format "Task_X — Task_Y". That matches.

Check that we have all pairs: Are there any other pairs that can be executed in parallel? Possibly tasks that are not directly dependent could be parallel across different branches. For instance, "Schedule_Machines" and "Quality_Check"? No, because Quality_Check cannot start until Fabricate, which requires Schedule_Machines to be done. So they are not parallel. Similarly, "Procure_Materials" and "Create_Documentation"? No, because Create_Documentation cannot start until after Fabricate, which requires Procurement. So no.

Thus only those two pairs.

Now, we need to ensure we ignore Process A. The user explicitly said ignore Process A entirely.

Thus answer is:

Create_Documentation — Quality_Check
Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines

Make sure formatting exactly matches "Task_X — Task_Y". There's spaces around dash. Use exactly one space before and after dash. Also ensure each pair on separate line.

Thus final answer.

But the question says "List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." It might require listing each pair of tasks that can be executed concurrently, not just the pairs that are explicitly said to be parallel. However, given the description, only those two pairs are possible. So answer is correct.

Now let's double-check the wording: "List every pair of tasks in Process B that can be executed in parallel according to the description above." The phrase "according to the description above" suggests we should only consider pairs that are explicitly indicated as parallel. So it's fine.

Now ensure alphabetical ordering within each pair. "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" is correct alphabetical order: C < Q. "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" is alphabetical order: P < S.

Now overall alphabetical ordering: "Create_Documentation — Quality_Check" (C) < "Procure_Materials — Schedule_Machines" (P). So correct.

Thus final answer.
