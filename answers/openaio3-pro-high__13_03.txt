1. Count of “Manual Fraud Check”: 1 occurrence.

2. The excerpt spans only 14 events from three cases recorded early on 1 March. With just one manual-fraud-check event visible (1 / 14 events; 1 / 3 cases), an analyst could wrongly generalize this tiny, non-random slice to the entire month-long log. Because the snippet’s time window, case mix and extraction criteria are unknown, it may under- or over-represent situations that trigger manual fraud checks. Without the remaining cases and days, any frequency or proportion calculated here lacks statistical reliability, so prevalence in the full dataset could be much higher—or lower—than the single example suggests.
