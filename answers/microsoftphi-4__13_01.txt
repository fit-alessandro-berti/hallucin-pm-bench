1. The activity **“Manual_Fraud_Check”** occurs exactly **1** time in this fragment.

2. To find the percentage of all logged events that this represents, we first determine the total number of events. There are 18 lines, each representing one event. Therefore, the percentage is:

   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{18}\right) \times 100 = 5.56\%
   \]

3. The case identifier that contains “Manual_Fraud_Check” is **A1002**.

4. Two sampling-related reasons why the estimate of the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks is unreliable:

   - **Sample Size**: The fragment only contains data from 4 cases, which is a very small sample size. Conclusions drawn from such a small dataset are not statistically significant and may not represent the larger population accurately.

   - **Time Frame**: The data covers only a single day (May 1, 2025), which may not account for daily, weekly, or seasonal variations in the frequency of manual fraud checks. A single day's data does not capture potential fluctuations or patterns that could occur over longer periods.
