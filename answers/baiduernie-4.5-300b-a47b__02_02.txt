Let's analyze the XES event log fragment to answer the questions:

### Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?
- The `case` attribute values in the events are: C001, C002, C003 (each appearing multiple times).
- The distinct cases are: C001, C002, C003.
- **Answer**: 3

### Q2: For case "C002", list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred.
- Events for C002 (in timestamp order):
  1. Receive_Order (2025-03-01T09:15:10)
  2. Check_Stock (2025-03-01T09:22:55)
  3. Arrange_Delivery (2025-03-01T10:15:20)
  4. Ship_Order (2025-03-01T10:25:40)
- Sequence: Receive_Order → Check_Stock → Arrange_Delivery → Ship_Order
- **Answer**: Receive_Order→Check_Stock→Arrange_Delivery→Ship_Order

### Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes "Ship_Order" (alphabetically ordered).
- Examine the activity immediately before each "Ship_Order":
  1. For C001: Ship_Order follows Check_Stock (but Check_Stock is not immediately before Ship_Order; there is no event between Check_Stock and Ship_Order for C001, so Check_Stock is the immediate predecessor).
     - Wait, no: Looking at C001:
       - Check_Stock (2025-03-01T09:20:05)
       - Ship_Order (2025-03-01T10:05:10)
       - No other events in between, so Check_Stock is the immediate predecessor.
  2. For C002: Ship_Order follows Arrange_Delivery (no events in between).
     - Arrange_Delivery (2025-03-01T10:15:20)
     - Ship_Order (2025-03-01T10:25:40)
     - So Arrange_Delivery is the immediate predecessor.
  3. For C003: Ship_Order follows Check_Stock (no events in between).
     - Check_Stock (2025-03-01T09:25:05)
     - Ship_Order (2025-03-01T10:20:30)
     - So Check_Stock is the immediate predecessor.
- Immediate predecessors of "Ship_Order":
  - Arrange_Delivery (from C002)
  - Check_Stock (from C001 and C003)
- Distinct activities: Arrange_Delivery, Check_Stock
- Alphabetically ordered: 
  - Arrange_Delivery
  - Check_Stock
- **Answer**: 
  Arrange_Delivery
  Check_Stock

### Final Answers:
Q1: 3  
Q2: Receive_Order→Check_Stock→Arrange_Delivery→Ship_Order  
Q3:  
Arrange_Delivery  
Check_Stock
