The supplied event log (Artefact A) contains only the column headers; every row, including all activity names, timestamps, and other values, has been redacted for privacy. Without any actual data on start_time and complete_time values specifically for events where activity is “Approve Invoice”, it is impossible to compute cycle times (as complete_time minus start_time), their average, standard deviation, or 95% confidence interval. Artefact B provides unrelated historical KPIs that cannot substitute for log-specific computations.
