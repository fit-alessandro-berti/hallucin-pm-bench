### Answer:  
**No**  
### Justification:  
The fact states that "Validate_Payment" must always occur immediately after "Receive_Order" with no intervening activities. However, the event-log excerpt shows two cases where this is **not** true:  
1. **Case C002**:  
   - Receive_Order at 09:30:00  
   - Next activity is Pack_Items at 09:50:00 (not Validate_Payment).  
   - Validate_Payment occurs later at 10:05:00, after an intervening activity (Pack_Items).  
2. **Case C004**:  
   - Receive_Order at 10:05:00  
   - Next activity is Check_Fraud at 10:07:00 (not Validate_Payment).  
   - Validate_Payment occurs later at 10:20:00, after an intervening activity (Check_Fraud).  
In both cases, "Validate_Payment" does not immediately follow "Receive_Order" (there is at least one activity in between). Thus, the fact is violated.
