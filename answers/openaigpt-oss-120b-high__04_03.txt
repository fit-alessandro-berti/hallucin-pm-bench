**No**

- **Rule 1** – `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` each appear once, and QE precedes RA. ✓  
- **Rule 2** – Because `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA. ✓  
- **Rule 3** – `Notify_Authorities` is placed **before** `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`; it must wait until **both** QE and RA are finished. This violates the rule. ✗  
- **Rule 4** – `Close_Case` follows NA and VP, so it is correctly sequenced. ✓  

Since Rule 3 is breached, the trace does not comply with the recall‑handling ruleset.
