**TO:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**FROM:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**RE:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Bottlenecks

Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment are the three critical bottlenecks.

**Request_Documents** exhibits catastrophic queueing (150 min avg wait), 22 % rework (highest), and throughput collapse (190 cases/day vs. 270 upstream). **Action:** Deploy an automated document portal with smart checklists to cut missing submissions and eliminate the backlog.

**Review_Documents** causes the highest SLA breaches (12.4 %) due to 25‑minute processing time and extreme variability (σ = 9). **Action:** Implement AI‑assisted review tools to standardize processing and reduce variance.

**Initial_Assessment** generates early‑stage delays (18‑min wait) and 3.2 % SLA breaches. **Action:** Increase assessor headcount to match the 280‑case daily intake from Registration, closing the 10‑case capacity gap.
