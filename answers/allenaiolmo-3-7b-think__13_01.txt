1. **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**  
   The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1 time** (in the entry for case A1002 at 2025-05-01T10:50:00).  

2. **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**  
   There are 18 total events. The calculation is:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{18} \times 100 \approx 5.56\%
   \]  
   **Answer:** 5.56%  

3. **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**  
   The case identifier **A1002** contains the activity "Manual_Fraud_Check".  

4. **Two sampling-related reasons why the monthly frequency estimate is unreliable:**  
   - **Temporal Sampling Bias**: The log fragment likely represents only a small subset of the entire month’s data (e.g., a single day or limited time window). If "Manual_Fraud_Check" is more common during unlogged periods or less frequent overall, the estimate will be skewed.  
   - **Non-Random Selection**: The fragment may capture data from specific cases (e.g., A1002) or times (e.g., peak fraud-checking hours) that are not representative of the broader monthly population. This introduces selection bias, making the estimate ungeneralizable.
