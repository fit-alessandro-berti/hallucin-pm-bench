I cannot compute the average cycle time (or any derived metric such as standard deviation or confidence interval) for the activity “Approve Invoice” because the event log contains no actual data—only column headers and redacted values. Specifically, while the log stub defines the required columns—including `start_time` and `complete_time`—all timestamp entries have been removed for privacy, leaving no temporal measurements to calculate duration. Without at least the start and complete times for instances of “Approve Invoice”, the cycle time for this activity is mathematically undefined, and no statistical aggregation is possible.
