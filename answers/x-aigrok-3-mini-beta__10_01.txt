Below is the RACI matrix for FinCo's order-to-cash workflow, based on the provided process. I have strictly adhered to the required terminology rules, using "KYC Review", "Order Vetting", and "Payment Clearance" as specified. The matrix lists the activities as rows and the roles as columns. For each activity, I have assigned:

- **R (Responsible)**: The role that performs the task.
- **A (Accountable)**: The role ultimately answerable for the task's success.
- **C (Consulted)**: Not explicitly indicated in the process, so left blank.
- **I (Informed)**: Not explicitly indicated, so left blank.

The assignments are derived directly from the process description, with the primary handler for each activity designated as both Responsible and Accountable.

| KYC Review         |                       | R, A                   |                     |                 |
| Order Vetting      | R, A                |                         |                     |                 |
| Payment Clearance  |                       |                         | R, A               |                 |
| Record Update      |                       |                         |                     | R, A           |
| Notify Customer    | R, A                |                         |                     |                 |

This matrix ensures clarity on roles and responsibilities while maintaining the workflow's sequential nature. If additional details emerge, the matrix can be refined accordingly.
