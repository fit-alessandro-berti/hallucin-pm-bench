1) No.

2) Evidence by case:
- C001: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items (immediate here, but not sufficient to claim “always”).
- C002: Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment (Validate_Payment is not immediately after Receive_Order).
- C003: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order (immediate here).
- C004: Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items (Validate_Payment is not immediately after Receive_Order).

Since in C002 and C004 another activity occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, the claim that it “always” occurs immediately after is false.
