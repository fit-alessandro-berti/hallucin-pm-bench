In case C003 (lines 6–7), *Validate_Payment* occurs at 10:43:00Z (line 6) and *Receive_Order* follows at 10:45:00Z (line 7), meaning *Validate_Payment* precedes rather than follows *Receive_Order*. Additionally, case C005 (lines 11–12) includes *Validate_Payment* (line 11) but no *Receive_Order* event at all, further violating the claim that *Validate_Payment* always follows *Receive_Order* in the log.
