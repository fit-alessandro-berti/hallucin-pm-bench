## Step 1: Understand the FACT statement
The FACT statement claims that the activity "Validate_Payment" always occurs immediately after "Receive_Order," with no other activities in between. We need to verify this statement against the provided event-log excerpt.

## 2: Analyze the event-log excerpt for CaseID C001
For CaseID C001, the sequence is: Receive_Order (2025-01-03T09:12:00), Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T09:15:00). Here, Validate_Payment occurs immediately after Receive_Order.

## 3: Analyze the event-log excerpt for CaseID C002
For CaseID C002, the sequence is: Receive_Order (2025-01-03T09:30:00), Pack_Items (2025-01-03T09:50:00), Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:05:00). In this case, Validate_Payment does not occur immediately after Receive_Order; Pack_Items occurs in between.

## 4: Analyze the event-log excerpt for CaseID C003
For CaseID C003, the sequence is: Receive_Order (2025-01-03T09:40:00), Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T09:44:00), Ship_Order (2025-01-03T11:00:00). Here, Validate_Payment occurs immediately after Receive_Order.

## 5: Analyze the event-log excerpt for CaseID C004
For CaseID C004, the sequence is: Receive_Order (2025-01-03T10:05:00), Check_Fraud (2025-01-03T10:07:00), Validate_Payment (2025-01-03T10:20:00). In this case, Validate_Payment does not occur immediately after Receive_Order; Check_Fraud occurs in between.

## 6: Evaluate the FACT statement
Given that for CaseIDs C002 and C004, Validate_Payment does not occur immediately after Receive_Order (there are other activities in between), the FACT statement is not accurate for all cases in the event-log excerpt.

## 7: Conclusion
The FACT statement that "Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between" is not supported by the event-log excerpt. Therefore, the answer is No.

## 8: Justify the decision
The justification for the decision is based on CaseIDs C002 and C004, where Validate_Payment does not occur immediately after Receive_Order. For C002, the sequence is Receive_Order -> Pack_Items -> Validate_Payment, and for C004, it is Receive_Order -> Check_Fraud -> Validate_Payment. These sequences directly contradict the FACT statement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{No}$
