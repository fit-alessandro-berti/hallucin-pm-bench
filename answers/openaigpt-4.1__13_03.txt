1️⃣ The activity **“Manual Fraud Check”** occurs **once** in this excerpt.

2️⃣ This excerpt shows only a small sample (three cases), and “Manual Fraud Check” appears just once among them. However, sampling might not represent the full month. The analyst could misestimate manual fraud checks’ actual frequency because the distribution of activities can vary over time or across case types. Key patterns—like peak periods, process automation rates, or process variants—remain unseen. Without reviewing the entire log, it’s impossible to know if this low count is typical or an anomaly, risking misjudgment of how frequently manual fraud checks occur in March 2025.
