## Answer

**The average cycle time cannot be determined.**

The frequency table contains only activity names, lifecycle transitions, and occurrence counts — **no timestamps were released**. Calculating a cycle time (duration from a "start" event to its corresponding "complete" event) requires at minimum the `time:timestamp` attribute for each event pair, which is absent from the provided artefacts. Although the XES header declares the `Time` extension, the 148,371 trace elements (and all their timestamps) were explicitly withheld.
