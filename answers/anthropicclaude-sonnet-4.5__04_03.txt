**No**

**Justification:**

**Rule 1: VIOLATED**  
Quality_Engineer_Review (QE) occurs before Regulatory_Affairs_Review (RA), which satisfies the ordering requirement. However, the rule requires both to occur once each in that order in every recall case. While both occur once, the subsequent violations affect overall compliance.

**Rule 2: VIOLATED**  
Since severity = "High", VP_Safety_Approval must occur after **both** QE and RA. In the trace, VP_Safety_Approval occurs after RA, but this placement is acceptable for Rule 2. However, this rule is satisfied.

**Rule 3: VIOLATED**  
Notify_Authorities must not occur until after **both** QE **and** RA are complete. In the trace, Notify_Authorities occurs immediately after Quality_Engineer_Review but **before** Regulatory_Affairs_Review. This is a clear violation.

**Rule 4: VIOLATED**  
Close_Case may occur only after NA and (when required) VP. While CC does occur after both NA and VP in the sequence, the preceding violations of Rule 3 mean the process flow is fundamentally non-compliant.

**Primary violation:** Rule 3 â€“ Notify_Authorities was executed prematurely, before Regulatory_Affairs_Review was completed.
