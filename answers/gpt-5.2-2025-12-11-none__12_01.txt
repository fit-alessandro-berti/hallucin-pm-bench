No, the fact is **not accurate** in this event-log fragment.

- **Case 1001:** `Update_Inventory` occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund` (`Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund`), so `Authorize_Refund` is not immediately before `Update_Inventory`.
- **Case 1003:** `Update_Inventory` also occurs **before** `Authorize_Refund` and is **not immediately preceded** by it (`Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund`).
- **Case 1002:** There is **no** `Update_Inventory` event at all (`Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued`), so the claimed ordering cannot hold there either.
