**Question 1.** No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

**Explanation (Question 2):**
For T5 to fire, P2 and P5 must be marked. However, P5 can only be marked if T4 fires, which requires P4. Place P4 is marked by either T3 or T7. But T3 requires P2, which is initially empty (P2 is only marked by T1). If T5 were to fire before T3, P2 must be marked (from T1), but P5 would need to be marked as well. However, P5 depends on P4, which depends on T3 (for P3 â†’ P4 via T7) or T3 itself. Thus, T3 must fire before T5 to enable P4 (and subsequently P5). No firing sequence exists where T5 fires before T3. (Words: ~120)
