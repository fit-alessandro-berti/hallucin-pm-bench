Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Process – Targeted Improvement Recommendations

Dear COO,

Our Q1-2025 dashboard highlights three under-performing activities in the Claims Handling process:

1. Request_Documents  
• Under-performs due to an exceptionally high average wait time of 150 minutes and a rework rate of 22.0%, indicating major delays and customer follow-up issues.  
• Recommendation: Conduct a focused review of document request protocols and implement faster, automated follow-up systems to reduce waiting times and rework.

2. Review_Documents  
• Exhibits the longest processing time at 25 minutes with a high variability (stdev 9) and the highest SLA breach rate at 12.4%, suggesting inconsistent review practices.  
• Recommendation: Standardize review procedures and realign workloads to tighten processing consistency and adherence to SLAs.

3. Initial_Assessment  
• Shows a moderate but concerning performance with an 18-minute wait time and 12-minute processing time, alongside a 3.2% SLA breach rate, hinting at capacity or process bottlenecks.  
• Recommendation: Undertake a detailed workload and staffing assessment to optimize resource allocation and reduce delays.

Addressing these areas with data-driven actions should enhance overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
Senior Process-Performance Analyst
