The fact is not accurate. For instance, in case 1001 the sequence is: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund → Refund_Issued, so Authorize_Refund does not occur immediately before Update_Inventory but after it. In case 1003 the sequence is: Receive_Return → Inspect_Item → Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund, meaning again that Authorize_Refund does not immediately precede Update_Inventory. Additionally, in case 1002 Update_Inventory does not occur at all.
