This analysis identifies three activities with significant SLA breaches and high waiting times requiring immediate attention based on throughput data.

Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds, recording 900 seconds throughput and 600 seconds waiting time across 465 cases. Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with 600 seconds throughput and 480 seconds waiting time across 480 cases. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, showing 300 seconds throughput and 200 seconds waiting time across 1175 cases.

Recommendations:
*   Legal Approval: Increase capacity to close the 300-second throughput gap against the 600-second SLA.
*   Risk Review: Reduce waiting time by 180 seconds to align with the 300-second SLA.
*   Credit Assessment: Reduce throughput by 60 seconds to meet the 240-second SLA.

Addressing bottlenecks will restore compliance across the pipeline and improve case handling speed.
