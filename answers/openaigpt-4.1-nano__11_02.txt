Subject: Q1-2025 Claims Process Performance Insights and Recommendations

The three activities exhibiting the poorest performance are **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.  

**Request_Documents** shows a notably high average wait time of 150 minutes and a rework rate of 22%, indicating significant delays and possible process bottlenecks. The high wait suggests resource constraints or inefficient handoffs; targeted process streamlining or automation is recommended.  

**Review_Documents** has the highest average processing time (25 min) and a rework rate of 5.3%, implying quality issues or ambiguity in review criteria. Implementing standardized review protocols or decision-support tools can enhance efficiency.  

**Initial_Assessment** suffers from both a high average wait time of 18 minutes and a rework rate of 1.8%, coupled with a relatively high SLA breach (3.2%). This points to resource overload or insufficient training. Increasing assessor capacity or providing targeted training can reduce delays and improve adherence to SLAs.  

Focusing on these activities with targeted process improvements will significantly boost overall claims handling performance.
