1️⃣ **1** time.

2️⃣ This snippet spans only ~1.5 hours on one day, capturing just 3 cases (1001–1003). Case 1002 has the sole "Manual Fraud Check," but cases 1001 and 1003 use automatic fraud checks. An analyst might overestimate manual checks' commonality by extrapolating this 33% rate (1/3 cases) across the full month, ignoring potential daily/seasonal variations, later-case triggers for manual checks, or sampling bias in this early-morning excerpt.
