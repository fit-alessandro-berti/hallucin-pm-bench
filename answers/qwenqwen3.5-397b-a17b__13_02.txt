1. **1** time.

2. 
   a) **2.08%** of all events (1 out of 48).  
   b) **8.33%** of all unique cases (1 out of 12).

3. With only one occurrence across 12 cases, this activity is an outlier. Including it in aggregate metrics (e.g., average cycle time) skews results against the 11 cases using "Auto_Fraud_Check." Predictive models trained on this slice may overfit to this exception or ignore it as noise, failing to capture true process variants. Generalizing this behavior assumes manual checks are representative, leading to inaccurate capacity planning and risk assessment for the predominant automated process path observed in the remaining cases. Consequently, performance conclusions drawn from this excerpt would not reflect the typical operational reality.
