**Q1.** Yes. T5 competes with T3 for the sole token in P2, so to let T5 fire you must avoid T3.

**Q2.** One minimal run is: T1, T2, T7, T4, T5. T1 creates tokens in P1 and P2; T2–T7–T4 produce P5 from the P1 branch while leaving P2 untouched; then T5 consumes P2 and P5. After that, T3 can no longer fire.
