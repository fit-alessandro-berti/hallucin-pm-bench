3.  Low-support activities like Manual_Fraud_Check represent rare process variants. With only one instance in a small sample, generalising is statistically unsound: it risks overfitting models to noise or exceptions. Performance analyses (e.g., cycle time) can be skewed by this single outlier, yielding non-representative benchmarks. Predictive models lack sufficient training examples to reliably detect or forecast the activity's impact, creating a blind spot for future cases that require manual fraud review, ultimately undermining model accuracy and robustness.
