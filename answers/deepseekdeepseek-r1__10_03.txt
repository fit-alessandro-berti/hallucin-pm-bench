**Key**  
- **R** = Responsible | **A** = Accountable | **C** = Consulted | **I** = Informed  

**Rationale**  
- **Front-Office Analyst** holds R/A for Intake Vetting (performs initial review) and is **I** for Release Funds (notified post-completion).  
- **Compliance Analyst** owns R/A for KYC Review, AML Screening, and Risk Scoring (directly performs these tasks).  
- **Compliance Officer** is **A** for Approval Decision (final authority on escalated cases) and requires no consultation.  
- **Treasury Ops** is **I** during Approval Decision (awaits outcome) and **R/A** for Release Funds (executes payment).
