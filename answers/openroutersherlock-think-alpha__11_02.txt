**Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling – Top Performance Issues**

**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
**Date:** [Current]  

The three worst-performing activities are **Request_Documents**, **Review_Documents**, and **Initial_Assessment**.  

- **Request_Documents** underperforms due to extreme avg_wait_time_min (150), highest rework_rate_pct (22.0) driving repeats, and elevated sla_breach_pct (5.5); throughput drops sharply to 190 cases/day. *Action:* Standardize request templates to target rework <5%, based on 22% repeat rate.  

- **Review_Documents** suffers longest avg_processing_time_min (25), highest stdev_processing_time_min (9) signaling inconsistency, rework_rate_pct (5.3), and worst sla_breach_pct (12.4). *Action:* Deploy processing checklists to reduce stdev to <5 min.  

- **Initial_Assessment** shows notable avg_wait_time_min (18), rework_rate_pct (1.8), and sla_breach_pct (3.2) vs. peers. *Action:* Add staffing to cut wait time to <5 min per queue data.  

These fixes target root metrics for throughput gains. (148 words)
