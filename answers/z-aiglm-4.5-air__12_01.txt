Based on the event-log fragment, the fact is **not accurate**.  

**Justification:**  
- In **Case 1001**, the activity sequence is:  
  `Receive_Return` → `Inspect_Item` → **`Update_Inventory`** → `Authorize_Refund` → `Refund_Issued`.  
  Here, `Update_Inventory` is immediately preceded by `Inspect_Item`, not `Authorize_Refund`.  
- In **Case 1003**, the sequence is:  
  `Receive_Return` → `Inspect_Item` → **`Update_Inventory`** → `Quality_Check` → `Authorize_Refund`.  
  Again, `Update_Inventory` is immediately preceded by `Inspect_Item`, not `Authorize_Refund`.  

**Conclusion:**  
The claim that `Authorize_Refund` always occurs immediately before `Update_Inventory` is contradicted by Cases 1001 and 1003, where `Update_Inventory` is followed by `Authorize_Refund` but not preceded by it.
