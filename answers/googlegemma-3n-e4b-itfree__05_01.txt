To ensure the "FastClaimOnboarding" process meets the 48-hour SLA to reach "Triage Claim", we should introduce a timer event. 

After the "Claim Submitted" start event (Start_Claim), add a timer event with a duration of 48 hours. This timer will fire if the claim hasn't reached "Triage Claim" within the specified timeframe. 

Upon timer firing, a sequence flow should connect the timer to the "Task_RequestDocs" (if it hasn't already been reached), or back to the start event, effectively restarting the process. This will automatically escalate claims that exceed the SLA without adding new tasks or subprocesses, ensuring timely processing.
