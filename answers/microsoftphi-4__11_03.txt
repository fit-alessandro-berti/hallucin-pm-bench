**Executive Memo**

To: Orionâ€™s COO

Subject: Analysis of Key Performance Indicators and Recommendations for Improvement

After a thorough analysis of our lending process performance, the following activities have been identified as the worst-performing based on the joint criteria of SLA breaches and high waiting times:

1. **Receive Application**:
   - **SLA Breach**: Current average throughput time is 55 seconds below the target SLA of 60 seconds. However, the average waiting time of 10 seconds is concerning.
   - **Recommendation**: Streamline initial data capture by implementing pre-filled application forms using customer data, thus reducing waiting time.

2. **Credit Assessment**:
   - **SLA Breach**: Exceeds the target SLA by 60 seconds, with a current throughput time of 300 seconds.
   - **Recommendation**: Leverage machine learning models to pre-assess and prioritize credit evaluations, decreasing both throughput and waiting times.

3. **Risk Review**:
   - **SLA Breach**: Throughput time of 600 seconds surpasses the target SLA by 300 seconds, coupled with a significant average waiting time of 480 seconds.
   - **Recommendation**: Reduce waiting times by deploying additional risk analysts during peak periods, thereby accelerating processing times.

By addressing these areas with targeted actions based on data insights, we can enhance overall process efficiency and better meet SLA commitments.
