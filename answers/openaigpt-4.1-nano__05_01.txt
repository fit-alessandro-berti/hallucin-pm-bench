To ensure the SLA is met, add an intermediate timer boundary event (e.g., Timer_Event) attached to the “Receive Claim” task (ID: Task_Receive). Set this timer to 48 hours. Connect the timer’s outgoing flow directly to an existing escalation handling process (not included here) or assign it an appropriate escalation pathway outside this process diagram, ensuring that if the claim isn’t progressed to “Check Completeness” within 48 hours, it is automatically escalated. This approach enforces the 48-hour SLA without adding new activities or subprocesses, simply leveraging a timer boundary event to trigger an escalation if necessary.
