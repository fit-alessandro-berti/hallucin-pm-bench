Subject: Action Required on Critical Process Bottlenecks  

Three activities are severely underperforming, exceeding their SLAs and exhibiting high waiting times: Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment. Risk Review averages 600 seconds, exceeding its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds, with 480 seconds waiting. Legal Approval averages 900 seconds—300 seconds over its 600-second SLA—of which 600 seconds are spent waiting. Credit Assessment takes 300 seconds on average, surpassing its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds, with 200 seconds in waiting. These delays significantly impact downstream throughput and customer experience.  

To address these bottlenecks:  
• Reallocate senior underwriters to Risk Review and Legal Approval to reduce case handling time and eliminate queue buildup.  
• Implement automated identity verification follow-ups to reduce upstream delays feeding into Credit Assessment.  
• Introduce parallel processing for Legal Approval and Draft Offer to decrease handoff delays and waiting time.
