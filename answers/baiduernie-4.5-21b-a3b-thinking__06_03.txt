To answer the question focusing on **Process B â€“ Warehouse_Replenishment**, we analyze the parallel splits (`|| Parallel Split #X ||`) and identify the sets of tasks that execute concurrently (i.e., tasks on different branches of the same parallel construct).  

### Step-by-Step Analysis of Process B:  
1. **First Parallel Split (#1)**:  
   - Location: After `Receive_Stock` (Step 3).  
   - Concurrent Tasks: `Quality_Check` and `Update_Inventory` (these tasks run in parallel due to the split).  

2. **Second Parallel Split (#2)**:  
   - Location: After `Store_Items` (Step 6).  
   - Concurrent Tasks: `Generate_Replenishment_Report` and `Notify_Procurement` (these tasks run in parallel due to the split).  


### Final Answer:  
1. Set 1: Quality_Check, Update_Inventory (tasks concurrent in Parallel Split #1)  
2. Set 2: Generate_Replenishment_Report, Notify_Procurement (tasks concurrent in Parallel Split #2)
