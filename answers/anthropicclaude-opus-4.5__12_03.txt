**No**

## Justification

The FACT claims that "Validate_Payment" **always** occurs immediately after "Receive_Order" with no other activities in between. However, the event log provides clear counterexamples:

### Case C002:
- Receive_Order (09:30:00)
- **Pack_Items** (09:50:00)
- Validate_Payment (10:05:00)

Here, **Pack_Items** occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, violating the claimed pattern.

### Case C004:
- Receive_Order (10:05:00)
- **Check_Fraud** (10:07:00)
- Validate_Payment (10:20:00)

Here, **Check_Fraud** occurs between Receive_Order and Validate_Payment, again violating the claimed pattern.

### Cases where the pattern holds:
- **C001**: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment (immediately after)
- **C003**: Receive_Order → Validate_Payment (immediately after)

Since the word "always" requires the pattern to hold in **all** cases, and we have two clear counterexamples (C002 and C004), the FACT is **inaccurate**.
