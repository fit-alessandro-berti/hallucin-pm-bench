Certainly. Here's the response based strictly on Acme Bank’s described small-business loan-approval process:

---

### a) Decision Points Summary

1. **Risk-based Auto-Skip Rule (Step 4):**  
 If the risk outcome from the Tri-Color-Risk-Check is either Low or Medium and the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, then skip the Manual-Underwriting-Review (step 5).

2. **TriVote Decision Gate (Step 6):**  
 The loan is approved if at least two out of three reviewers—Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer—approve it.
