Of course. Here is a summary of the decision points and a list of all required documents for Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track process, following the specified terminology.

### Decision Points

Based on the process, the key decision points that determine an application's path are:

*   **Underwriter Alignment Gate:** After two independent risk scores are assigned, this gate determines the next step. If the scores differ by 2 points or less, the process continues. If they differ by more than 2 points, the application is escalated to the Harmonisation Committee.
*   **Amount Threshold Decision:** This decision is based on the loan amount requested. Applications for amounts less than €15,000 are auto-approved. Applications for amounts of €15,000 or more are forwarded to the next step.
*   **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA):** For loans of €15,000 or more, the board holds a final vote to either *approve* or *reject* the application.

The following documents are required for the process:

*   Digital Application Form (ML-APP-01)
