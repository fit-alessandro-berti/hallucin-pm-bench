**Non‑compliant**

1. **Rule 2** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag`. Consequently, `Risk_Assessment` **must occur before** the first `Ship_Goods`. Here, `Ship_Goods` (step 8) precedes `Risk_Assessment` (step 9), violating the rule.  
2. **Rule 3** – After `Goods_Received` (step 6), `Three_way_match` must be performed within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). It actually appears at step 10, which is four positions after `Goods_Received`, thus breaching the required distance.
