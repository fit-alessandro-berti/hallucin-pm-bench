**a) Decision Points (Gates or Conditional Branches) — One-Sentence Rules:**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check Outcome Gate**:  
   *If the risk rating is Low or Medium AND the requested loan amount is ≤ €250,000, the process skips Manual Underwriting Review; otherwise, it proceeds to it.*

2. **TriVote Decision Gate**:  
   *The loan passes only if at least two of the three approvers — Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, and Sustainability Officer — approve; a majority of two out of three is sufficient.*
