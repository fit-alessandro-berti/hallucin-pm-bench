Based on the **Micro-loan Fast-Track (May 2025)** process, here are the decision points and the required documentation:

### **Decision Points**

1.  **Underwriter Alignment Gate:**
    Following the **Dual Underwriter Split**, the system compares the risk scores (0–9) from **Senior Underwriter A** and **Shadow Underwriter B**.
    *   If the scores differ by **≤ 2 points**, the process continues to the **Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC)**.
    *   If the scores differ by **> 2 points**, the application is escalated to the **Harmonisation Committee** for a tie-break decision before proceeding.

2.  **Amount Threshold Decision:**
    The process diverges based on the requested loan value:
    *   **Amount < €15 000:** The system triggers an auto-approval.
    *   **Amount ≥ €15 000:** The application is routed to the **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**.

3.  **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA):**
    For applications ≥ €15 000, the board conducts a formal vote to either **approve** or **reject** the application.
