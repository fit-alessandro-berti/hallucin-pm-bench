Answer: Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

Explanation: From the initial marking (p0=1, all others 0), fire T1 to move a token to p1 and p2. Next, fire T2 so that p1→p3 and now we have p3=1, p2=1, p4=0. At this point, T5 is enabled (because its inhibitor arc requires p4=0 and there is indeed a token in p3). Hence T5 can fire before T3. Concretely:

1) T1: p0 →{p1,p2}  
   (p1=1, p2=1)  
2) T2: p1 → p3  
   (p3=1, p2=1)  
3) T5: p3 → p6, with inhibitor (p4=0)  
   (p3=0, p6=1, p2=1)  
4) Finally, T3 can still fire later: p2 → p4

Thus, T5 indeed can fire before T3.
