Question 1  
Yes – T5 can be executed before T3 in a reachable marking.

Question 2  
After the AND-split, the P1-token can move to P5 while the P2-token is kept. When P5 and P2 are both marked, T5 is enabled although T3 has never fired.

Minimal firing sequence:  
T1, T2, T7, T4, T5

Markings along the sequence:  
M0: {P0}  
T1→ M1: {P1, P2}  
T2→ M2: {P2, P3}  
T7→ M3: {P2, P4}  
T4→ M4: {P2, P5}  
T5→ M5: {P6}

Thus T5 fires before T3, proving it is possible.
