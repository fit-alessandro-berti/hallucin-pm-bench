No.

**Justification:**
*   **Rule 1:** Satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs once, followed by `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` once.
*   **Rule 2:** Satisfied. Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both `Quality_Engineer_Review` and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review`.
*   **Rule 3:** Violated. `Notify_Authorities` occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete.
*   **Rule 4:** Satisfied. `Close_Case` occurs after `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
