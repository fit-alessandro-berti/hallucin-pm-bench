**No**

**Justification:**

*   **Rule 1 satisfied:** `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurs (step 3), and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) occurs (step 5). They both happen once, and QE is before RA.
*   **Rule 2 satisfied:** `severity` is "High". `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs at step 6, which is after QE (step 3) and RA (step 5).
*   **Rule 3 violated:** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs at step 4. This is *before* `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) at step 5. NA must occur after *both* QE and RA are complete.
*   **Rule 4 satisfied:** `Close_Case` (CC) occurs at step 7. This is after `Notify_Authorities` (NA at step 4) and after `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP at step 6, which is required by rule 2 as severity is "High").
