**a) Decision points (gates / conditionals) and their one‑sentence rules**

1. **Tri-Color-Risk-Check outcome**  
   The combined results of Scorecard–Cyan, Scorecard–Magenta, and Scorecard–Yellow produce a **risk rating of Low, Medium, or High**, which determines whether the loan can proceed and whether manual underwriting is needed.

2. **Conditional branch on risk level and amount (step 4)**  
   *If and only if* the risk rating is **Low or Medium** **and** the requested amount is **≤ €250,000**, the process **skips Manual-Underwriting-Review (step 5)**; otherwise, Manual-Underwriting-Review must occur.

3. **Decision-Gate “TriVote” (step 6)**  
   The loan passes the TriVote gate **if at least two of the three parties (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) approve**, and fails otherwise.
