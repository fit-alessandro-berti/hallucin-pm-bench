Non‑compliant  

1. **Rule 2** – The trace contains `Expedite_Flag` (event 4). Consequently, `Risk_Assessment` must occur **before** the first `Ship_Goods`. In the trace, `Ship_Goods` (event 8) precedes `Risk_Assessment` (event 9), violating the “must occur before” requirement.  

2. **Rule 3** – After `Goods_Received` (event 6), `Three_way_match` must appear within the next two activities (distance ≤ 2). The next two activities are `Move_to_Quality` (event 7) and `Ship_Goods` (event 8); `Three_way_match` occurs at event 10, which is four steps later, exceeding the allowed distance.  

All other rules (1, 4, 5) are satisfied, but the violations of Rules 2 and 3 render the trace **Non‑compliant**.
