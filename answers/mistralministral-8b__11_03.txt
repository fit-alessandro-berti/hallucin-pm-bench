**To:** COO, Orion Credit

**Subject:** Performance Analysis and Action Plan for Key Activities

Dear COO,

After a thorough analysis of our process performance data, I have identified the three worst-performing activities based on SLA breaches and high waiting times. These activities are:

- **Legal Approval:** This activity exceeds its SLA by 180 seconds (1800 seconds - 600 seconds target SLA) and has an average waiting time of 600 seconds.
- **Risk Review:** This activity exceeds its SLA by 300 seconds (600 seconds - 300 seconds target SLA) and has an average waiting time of 480 seconds.
- **Credit Assessment:** This activity exceeds its SLA by 60 seconds (300 seconds - 240 seconds target SLA) and has an average waiting time of 200 seconds.

**Recommendations:**

- **Legal Approval:** Implement a **dedicated legal review team** to streamline the approval process, reducing waiting times and SLA breaches.
- **Risk Review:** **Automate risk assessment tools** to expedite the review process and minimize waiting times.
- **Credit Assessment:** **Provide additional training** to assessors to improve efficiency and reduce assessment times.

Please review these recommendations and consider the proposed actions to improve our process performance and meet SLA targets.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
Senior Process-Performance Analyst, Orion Credit
