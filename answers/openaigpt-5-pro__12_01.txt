No.

Justification:
- Case 1001: Update_Inventory (08:25:55) occurs before Authorize_Refund (08:30:02); so Authorize_Refund is not immediately before Update_Inventory.
- Case 1002: Authorize_Refund (10:18:40) is followed by Refund_Issued; Update_Inventory does not occur.
- Case 1003: Update_Inventory (10:08:07) occurs before Authorize_Refund (10:22:18), with Quality_Check in between.
