Attach an interrupting timer boundary event to Task_RequestDocs.

• New element: Boundary timer “Timer_48h” (id Timer_48h) attached to Task_RequestDocs; timeDuration = “PT48H”.  
• Connect its outgoing flow directly to a new escalation end event “End_Escalated” (id End_Esc) that throws escalation code “AutoEsc48h”.

Effect  
– As soon as a claim waits more than 48 hours after submission (timer starts counting when Task_RequestDocs becomes active), the task is interrupted and the process ends with an escalation, satisfying the SLA.  
– Claims whose documents are complete reach Task_Triage immediately via flow f5; they never trigger the timer, so normal processing is unchanged.

No new tasks or subprocesses were added—only a timer boundary event and an end event.
