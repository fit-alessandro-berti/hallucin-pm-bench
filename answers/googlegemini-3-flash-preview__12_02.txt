No.

The fact is inaccurate because in Case **C003**, the activity *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 6 (10:43:00Z), which is prior to the *Receive_Order* activity at line 7 (10:45:00Z). Additionally, in Case **C005**, the activity *Validate_Payment* occurs at line 11 without any preceding *Receive_Order* activity appearing in the log fragment for that case. While cases C001, C002, and C004 do follow the stated sequence, the presence of C003 and C005 proves the "always follows" claim is false.
