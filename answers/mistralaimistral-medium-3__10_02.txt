Here’s the RACI table in Markdown format, strictly adhering to the mandated vocabulary:

```markdown
| Task                                      | Transaction Analyst | Regulatory Liaison | IT Support | Notes                     |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Receive and log transfer instruction      | R                   |                    |            |                           |
| Screen payment against sanctions list     | R                   |                    |            |                           |
| Perform KYC Review on sender/beneficiary  |                     | R                  |            |                           |
| Approve high-risk transaction             |                     | A                  |            | Only if flagged           |
| Release payment                           | R                   |                    | C          | After approval (if needed)|
| Send SWIFT message                        |                     |                    | R          |                           |
| Archive case file                         |                     |                    | R          |                           |
| Notify Regulatory Liaison of completion   |                     | I                  |            |                           |

**Key:**
- **R** = Responsible (executes the task)
- **A** = Accountable (ultimate ownership/approval)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)
- **I** = Informed (notified of outcome)
```

### Notes:
- **Transaction Analyst** replaces "payment clerk" as the role responsible for logging, screening, and releasing payments.
- **Regulatory Liaison** replaces "compliance officer" for KYC Review and approvals.
- **IT Support** remains unchanged as it’s not part of the vocabulary mandate.
- "High-risk approval" is explicitly assigned to the **Regulatory Liaison (A)** to clarify accountability.
