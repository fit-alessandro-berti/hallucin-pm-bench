**No**

Justification:
- **Rule 1**: Violated. `Quality_Engineer_Review` occurs, but `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` happens *after* `Notify_Authorities`, breaking the required order and making `Notify_Authorities` occur before RA is complete.
- **Rule 2**: Satisfied. `VP_Safety_Approval` occurs after both QE and RA.
- **Rule 3**: Violated. `Notify_Authorities` happens before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` is complete.
- **Rule 4**: Satisfied. `Close_Case` occurs after both `Notify_Authorities` and `VP_Safety_Approval`.
