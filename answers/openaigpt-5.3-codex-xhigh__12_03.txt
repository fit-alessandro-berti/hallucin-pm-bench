1. **No.**

2. The claim is **not accurate** in this log excerpt because there are counterexamples:

- **C002:** `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`  
  - `Validate_Payment` is **not immediately after** `Receive_Order` (since `Pack_Items` is in between).

- **C004:** `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items`  
  - `Validate_Payment` is again **not immediately after** `Receive_Order` (since `Check_Fraud` is in between).

For completeness, it is immediate in **C001** and **C003**, but not in all cases, so “always” is false.
