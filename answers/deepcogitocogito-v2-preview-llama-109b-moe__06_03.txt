Alright, let's focus on Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment. The user wants me to list each set of tasks that can execute concurrently, which means tasks that lie on different branches of the same parallel construct.

First, I'll need to review the steps of Process B. Here they are again:

1. Start
2. Receive_Stock
3. || Parallel Split #1 ||
   • Quality_Check
   • Update_Inventory
4. || Merge #1 ||
5. Store_Items
6. || Parallel Split #2 ||
   • Generate_Replenishment_Report
   • Notify_Procurement
7. || Merge #2 ||
8. End

Now, I need to identify the parallel constructs. From the description, there are two parallel splits:

- The first one is at step 3, where Quality_Check and Update_Inventory run concurrently.
- The second one is at step 6, where Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement run concurrently.

Each of these parallel splits creates a set of tasks that can execute at the same time. 

So, the first set is Quality_Check and Update_Inventory. The second set is Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement.

I should number these sets in the order they appear. The first set appears first (after Receive_Stock), and the second set appears later (after Store_Items). 

I don't need to mention anything about Processes A or C, just focus on Process B. The user didn't ask for any other details, just the concurrent task sets. 

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any other parallel constructs. The process has two clear parallel splits, each with two tasks. There's no other mention of parallel execution elsewhere in the steps. 

Yes, that's it. The two sets are as identified.
1. Quality_Check and Update_Inventory (Parallel Split #1)
2. Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement (Parallel Split #2)
