## Analysis of the Claim

The claim that "Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately *before* 'Update_Inventory'" is **inaccurate** based on the event log data.

### Evidence:
- In Case 1001: "Update_Inventory" (08:25:55) occurs before "Authorize_Refund" (08:30:02)
- In Case 1003: "Update_Inventory" (10:08:07) occurs before "Authorize_Refund" (10:22:18)
- In Case 1002: "Update_Inventory" doesn't appear at all, so there is no relationship between these activities

The data shows that when both activities occur in the same case, "Update_Inventory" actually precedes "Authorize_Refund" rather than following it.
