**Memo**
**To:** COO, Acme Insurance
**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Analysis

**Three worst-performing activities:**
1. **Request_Documents** (throughput lag, inefficiency, and r√©cemmente breaches). SLA breaches (5.5%) and highest rework (22.0%) indicate documentation gaps and retrievability issues. The low throughput (190 cases/day) exacerbates delays.
   *Action:* Automate routine document requests with template-driven, API-connected systems.

2. **Review_Documents** (slow execution, high variability). Longest processing time (25 min avg, with 22-min stdev) and high SLA breaches (12.4%) signal unclear review criteria or manual bottlenecks.
   *Action:* Standardize a guided, audit-ready review checklist and train reviewers.

3. **Initial_Assessment** and **Pay_Claim** show ambiguous performance. While **Initial_Assessment** has a moderate SLA breach (3.2%), its processing time (12 min) is the second-worst and rework is elevated (1.8%). **Pay_Claim** has negligible breaches (0.3%) but slightly worse throughput than adjacent steps.
   *Action for Initial_Assessment:* Integrate AI triage for high-risk claims to reduce rework. *Note: Data does not justify payroll action.*

**Next Steps:** Execute pilots on automation (doubled impact).
