Non-compliant  
**Justification:**  
Rule P2P-2025.R1, Subrule 2 requires both Procurement Officer and CFO approval *before* `Issue_PO`. In the trace:  
- Activity 2 ("Approve_PO") is completed by the Procurement Officer.  
- However, Activity 3 ("Approve_PO_CFO") is assigned to the CFO, but it does **not** appear before `Issue_PO`. Although timestamps indicate CFO approval occurs *after* `Issue_PO` (timestamp 12:05 vs. 12:07 for issue), the key violation is that approval process is not clearly split and confirmed by all required roles *sequentially* via the trace—rule enforcement requires explicit, ordered round-trip approvals, and this trace does not include definitive proof that CFO approval precedes PO issuance in the audit trail (as triggered by a role switch after 12:05). Moreover, Rule 4 is violated: `Three_way_match` (trade agreement verification) occurs at timestamp 10 (before `Risk_Assessment` might be expected post-PO), which introduces ambiguity in the P2P flow—this trace lacks specific evidence of Expedite-Flag affecting Quality_Check yet here Risk_Assessment precedes Ship_Goods, but more critically, the ROle-approval requirement has structural gaps in proper separation and validation. Finally, Rule 5: `Archive_Record` is present and correctly placed, though the trace's activity sequence and approval timing pose foundational compliance risks.  

**Critical missing thing:** While the PO is approved, approval sequence must reflect *Step 1: RO* and then *Step 2: CFO* before `Issue_PO` practically, and here the CFO role appears after `Issue_PO`. The trace breaks the clear, sequential alumni chain needed for P2P-2025.R1, especially with Expedite handling disrupting timing clarity. Additional review—specifically confirming two valid approvals split and ordered—is needed, but baseline compliance is breached.
