### Decision Points

1.  **Triage Agent Validation:** The claim must be validated against the *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport* to determine if the passenger is eligible.
2.  **Finance Controller Approval:** The process requires a sign-off from the Finance Controller using the *EligibilityChecklist* before payment can be processed.
3.  **High-Value Threshold:** If the refund amount is greater than **€1 000**, the workflow must proceed to *Senior_Auditor_Review*.
