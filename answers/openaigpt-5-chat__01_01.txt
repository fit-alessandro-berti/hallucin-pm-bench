Alright — here’s the decision‑point and document summary strictly based on the non‑standard Contoso Airlines refund process you provided.

## **Decision Points**

1. **Eligibility validation by triage agent**  
   *Location in process:* **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   *Decision:* Is the claim eligible based on *FlightManifest* and *WeatherReport*?  
   *Outcome:* Only eligible claims proceed to the finance controller.

2. **High‑value amount check**  
   *Location in process:* After **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   *Decision:* Is the refund amount **greater than €1 000**?  
   *Outcome:*  
   – **Yes:** Case must go through **Senior_Auditor_Review** before payment.  
   – **No:** Process goes directly to payment step.
