To: Chief Operating Officer  
From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst  
Subject: Critical SLA Breaches and Process Bottlenecks

Performance data identifies Legal Approval, Risk Review, and Credit Assessment as the worst-performing activities, characterized by specific SLA breaches and excessive Avg_Waiting_Time.

Legal Approval presents the most severe total duration, exceeding the 600s Target_SLA by 300s. Risk Review creates an identical deficit, surpassing its 300s target by 300s. Credit Assessment follows, missing the 240s target by 60s. In all instances, waiting time represents the majority of the total duration.

I recommend the following immediate actions:

*   Investigate the bottleneck in Legal Approval to reduce the 600s Avg_Waiting_Time, which currently comprises two-thirds of the total throughput.
*   Restructure the Risk Review incoming queue to address the 480s Avg_Waiting_Time driving the 100% overage against the SLA.
*   Target the 200s Avg_Waiting_Time in Credit Assessment to bring the 300s Avg_Throughput_Time back within the 240s limit.
