Yes, it is possible for T5 to fire before T3.

One **shortest** firing sequence (from the initial marking) in which T5 fires and T3 has not yet fired is:

> **T1, T2b, T4, T5**

Stepwise:

- **M0**: p0 = 1  
  Enabled: T1

1. **Fire T1**: p0 → pa, pb  
   **M1**: pa = 1, pb = 1

2. **Fire T2b**: pa → pd  
   **M2**: pb = 1, pd = 1

3. **Fire T4**: pb → pe  
   **M3**: pd = 1, pe = 1  
   Here T5 is enabled; T3 is not (pc = 0).

4. **Fire T5**: pd + pe → pf  
   **M4**: pf = 1

Up to and including the firing of **T5**, transition **T3** has never fired and is not enabled.

**Why this sequence is shortest:**

- T5 needs one token in **pd** and one in **pe**.
- From the initial marking, the only way to get:
  - **pd** without using T3 is via **T2b**, which requires **pa**, which comes from **T1**.
  - **pe** is via **T4**, which requires **pb**, which also comes from **T1**.
- Therefore, any sequence reaching a marking that enables T5 *without firing T3* must contain at least:
  - T1 (to create pa and pb),
  - T2b (to create pd),
  - T4 (to create pe),
  before T5 can fire.

So T5 cannot appear earlier than the 4th transition, and  
`T1, T2b, T4, T5` is indeed a shortest such sequence.
