**Summary:**
It is not possible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the “Approve Invoice” activity because the provided event log stub contains no actual data (timestamps or activity instances) necessary for these calculations. The SLA excerpt provides information about the time between activities, not the cycle time of “Approve Invoice” itself, and thus cannot be used as a substitute. Without the required data points, these metrics cannot be derived or estimated.
