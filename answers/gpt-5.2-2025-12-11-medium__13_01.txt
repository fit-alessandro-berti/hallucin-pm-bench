1. **“Manual_Fraud_Check” occurrences:** **1** time.

2. **Percentage of all logged events:**  
Total events in fragment = **18**.  
Manual_Fraud_Check events = **1**.  
Percentage = \( \frac{1}{18} \times 100 \) = **5.56%** (rounded to two decimals).

3. **Case identifier(s) containing “Manual_Fraud_Check”:** **A1002**

4. **Two sampling-related reasons the monthly estimate is unreliable (using only this fragment):**
- **Time-window bias / non-representative period:** The fragment covers only a short slice of time (all events shown are on **2025-05-01**), which may not reflect typical behavior across an entire month (e.g., day-of-week effects, promotions, end-of-month patterns).
- **Small sample size:** Only **18 events** (and effectively **4 cases**) are observed, with just **1** fraud-check event—too little data to produce a stable estimate; random variation can dominate the estimate.
