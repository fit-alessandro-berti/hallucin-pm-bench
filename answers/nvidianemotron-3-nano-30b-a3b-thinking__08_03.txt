**Answer: Yes – T5 can fire before the first occurrence of T3.**  

The shortest reachable firing sequence that enables T5 without ever having fired T3 is  

```
1. T1
2. T2b
3. T4
4. T5
```

(Any ordering that places the two “split‑output” transitions after T1 – e.g. `T1, T4, T2b, T5` – is equally short.)

**Why this works**

| Step | Marking after the step (relevant places) | Enabled transitions |
|------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 0 (initial) | p0 = 1 | **T1** |
| 1. **T1** consumes p0 → produces **pa, pb** | pa = 1, pb = 1 | **T2**, **T2b**, **T4** |
| 2. **T2b** consumes **pa** → produces **pd** | pd = 1, pb = 1 | **T2**, **T4** |
| 3. **T4** consumes **pb** → produces **pe** | pd = 1, pe = 1 | **T5** |
| 4. **T5** needs **pd** and **pe** (both present) → consumes them → produces **pf** | pf = 1 | – |

- **T3** never appears in this sequence; it requires a token in **pc**, which we never generate (we bypass it with the shortcut **T2b**).  
- Once the marking `pd = 1, pe = 1` is reached (after steps 2 and 3), **T5** is enabled, so it can fire immediately (step 4).  
- Therefore T5 fires **before** any possible firing of T3, and the sequence above is the minimal one (four firings total; three firings are insufficient because we need both the `pd`‑producing and `pe`‑producing transitions after the initial split).

Hence, the ordering “T5 before T3” is reachable, and the shortest firing sequence achieving it is **T1 → T2b → T4 → T5**.
