Add a **Timer Boundary Event** on `Task_Receive` with a 48-hour duration. If the timer triggers before the task completes, it fires an Escalation signal that interrupts the task and routes directly to `Task_Triage` via a new sequence flow. This ensures any claim stuck in the “Receive Claim” step beyond 48 hours still reaches triage on time, satisfying the SLA without adding new tasks. The existing flow from `Task_Receive` to `Task_Check` remains for normal cases. The Escalation event can be handled by a parallel flow that bypasses `Task_Check` and `GW_Docs`, jumping straight to `Task_Triage`.
