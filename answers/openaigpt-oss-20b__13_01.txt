1. **Small sample size** – With only 18 events (and only one occurrence of the activity), the estimate is highly susceptible to random variation; a single additional event would change the monthly frequency estimate dramatically.  
2. **Limited time window / selection bias** – The fragment covers a single day (2025‑05‑01) and does not capture any other days of the month or seasonal patterns. Consequently, the observed frequency may not be representative of the overall monthly rate.
