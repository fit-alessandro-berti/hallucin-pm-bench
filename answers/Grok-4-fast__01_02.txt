### Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

The process includes the following decision points, which determine branching or outcomes:

- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: If the two risk scores differ by ≤ 2 points, continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC). Otherwise, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision, then continue.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: If amount < €15 000, the system auto-approves and proceeds to Disburse Funds. If amount ≥ €15 000, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: The board votes *approve* (proceed to Disburse Funds) or *reject* (process ends).
