Based strictly on the provided event-log fragment, the fact is **inaccurate**.  

### Justification:  
- **Case 1001**:  
  - `Update_Inventory` occurs at *2025-03-01 08:25:55*.  
  - Its **immediate predecessor** is `Inspect_Item` (at *08:20:10*), **not** `Authorize_Refund`.  
  - `Authorize_Refund` occurs *after* `Update_Inventory` (at *08:30:02*).  

- **Case 1003**:  
  - `Update_Inventory` occurs at *2025-03-03 10:08:07*.  
  - Its **immediate predecessor** is `Inspect_Item` (at *10:02:31*), **not** `Authorize_Refund`.  
  - `Authorize_Refund` occurs *after* `Quality_Check` (at *10:22:18*), with `Update_Inventory` earlier in the sequence.  

- **Case 1002** lacks `Update_Inventory` entirely, so it does not satisfy the condition for testing the claim.  

The log shows **no instance** where `Authorize_Refund` occurs *immediately before* `Update_Inventory`. Instead, `Update_Inventory` is consistently preceded by `Inspect_Item`, and `Authorize_Refund` appears later in the sequence (after `Update_Inventory` in Case 1001, or after additional activities in Case 1003). Thus, the claim contradicts the observed data.
