1) 1

2) 5.56%

3) A1002

4) Two sampling-related reasons:
- Tiny sample: only 18 events across 4 cases; one occurrence drives the rate, yielding high sampling error.
- Non-representative time slice: all events come from a single ~5-hour window on one day, not a random sample across the month, so temporal selection bias is likely.
