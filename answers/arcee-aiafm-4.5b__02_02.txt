Let's approach these questions step by step:

### Q1: How many distinct cases are present in this fragment?

To determine the number of distinct cases, I'll list and count each unique case identifier (case="C###" concept:name) in the event log:
- C001
- C002
- C003

So, there are **3 distinct cases**.

**Answer to Q1:**
\boxed{3}

### Q2: For case "C002", list the sequence of activities in the order they occurred (use “→” as the separator).

Let's look for all events where the case is "C002":
- Event 2: "C002"
- Event 5: "C002"

The activities associated with these events are:
- Event 2: "Receive_Order"
- Event 5: "Check_Stock"

In order: "Receive_Order" → "Check_Stock"

**Answer to Q2:**
\boxed{"Receive_Order"→"Check_Stock"}

---

### Q3: Across all cases, list every distinct activity that immediately precedes “Ship_Order” (one per line, alphabetically ordered).

First, let's find all activities that immediately precede "Ship_Order":
- Event 7: "Ship_Order" (followed by "Ship_Order")
- Event 8: "Ship_Order" (followed by "Arrange_Delivery")
- Event 9: "Ship_Order" (followed by "Ship(Order)")
- Event 10: "Ship_Order" (followed by "Ship_Order")

Now, I'll collect the unique activities before "Ship_Order" and list them alphabetically:
- Arranged
- Checked
- Checked
- Checked
- Delivered
- Ordered
- Received

Alphabetically ordered: Arranged, Checked, Delivered, Ordered, Received

**Answer to Q3:**
\boxed{Arranged\nChecked\nDelivered\nOrdered\nReceived}
