## Question 1: Average Cycle Time for "Review Contract"

**Answer:** Cannot be derived from the provided data.

## Question 2: Explanation

The event log header provides **case IDs, activity names, and resource assignments**, but the critical information needed to calculate cycle time is missing:

- **Timestamps are explicitly redacted** ("timestamps & elapsed-time fields have been redacted")
- **No duration or elapsed-time data** is available for any activity

To calculate average cycle time for "Review Contract," I would need:
- Start timestamp and end timestamp for each "Review Contract" activity occurrence, OR
- Pre-calculated elapsed time for each instance

**What I can observe:** "Review Contract" appears 4 times in the visible rows (cases C-001, C-002, C-003, C-004), but without temporal data, cycle time cannot be quantified.
