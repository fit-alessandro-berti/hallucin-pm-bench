**Answer:** No  

**Justification**

- **Case C001:** Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items → *Validate_Payment is immediate after Receive_Order.*  
- **Case C002:** Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment → *Validate_Payment occurs after Pack_Items, not immediately after Receive_Order.*  
- **Case C003:** Receive_Order → Validate_Payment → Ship_Order → *Validate_Payment is immediate after Receive_Order.*  
- **Case C004:** Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment → Pack_Items → *Validate_Payment occurs after Check_Fraud, not immediately after Receive_Order.*

Because in cases **C002** and **C004** the activity *Validate_Payment* is preceded by another activity (Pack_Items and Check_Fraud, respectively), the statement “Validate_Payment always occurs immediately after Receive_Order, with no other activities in between” is **incorrect**.
