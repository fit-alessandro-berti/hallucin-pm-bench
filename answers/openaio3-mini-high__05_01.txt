I would introduce an “ESL race” using timer events along an existing branch. For example, immediately after the claim is submitted (Start_Claim), split the flow with a parallel gateway into the normal process and a timer branch. In the timer branch, add an intermediate timer event set to a duration of PT48H (48 hours) that then flows directly into the already–defined Triage Claim activity (Task_Triage). Then merge the two branches (for example, with an event‐based gateway) so whichever token arrives first is taken. This way, if the normal flow hasn’t reached Task_Triage within 48 hours, the timer branch auto–escalates the claim to triage—meeting the SLA without adding any new tasks.
