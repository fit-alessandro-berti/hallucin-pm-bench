Based solely on the provided event-log fragment, **the fact is inaccurate**.  

### Justification:  
The claim states that "Authorize_Refund" **always occurs immediately before** "Update_Inventory" in the same case. However, the log shows two counterexamples:  

1. **Case 1001**:  
   - `Update_Inventory` occurs at **2025-03-01 08:25:55**.  
   - The activity **immediately before** it is `Inspect_Item` (08:20:10), **not** `Authorize_Refund`.  
   - `Authorize_Refund` actually occurs **later** (08:30:02), immediately **after** `Update_Inventory`.  

2. **Case 1003**:  
   - `Update_Inventory` occurs at **2025-03-03 10:08:07**.  
   - The activity **immediately before** it is `Inspect_Item` (10:02:31), **not** `Authorize_Refund`.  
   - `Authorize_Refund` occurs **later** (10:22:18), separated by `Quality_Check` (10:15:42).  

### Key Observation:  
In both cases where `Update_Inventory` appears (1001 and 1003), it is **preceded by `Inspect_Item`**, not `Authorize_Refund`. The log contains **no instance** where `Authorize_Refund` immediately precedes `Update_Inventory`.  

### Note on Case 1002:  
Case 1002 lacks `Update_Inventory` entirely, so it does not provide evidence for or against the claim. The contradiction is already established by Cases 1001 and 1003.  

**Conclusion**: The fact is contradicted by the data.
