**No**

Trace 2025-05-RX17 violates ruleset R due to a failure in Rule 3. Here's a rule-by-rule justification:

- **Rule 1**: Satisfied. `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA), and both appear once.
- **Rule 2**: Satisfied. Since severity is "High", `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA.
- **Rule 3**: Violated. `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs after QE but before RA is complete, which is not allowed. NA must happen only after both reviews are finished.
- **Rule 4**: Satisfied. `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after NA and VP, as required.

The violation of Rule 3 makes the trace non-compliant.
