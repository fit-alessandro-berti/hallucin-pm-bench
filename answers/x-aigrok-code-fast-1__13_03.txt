1️⃣ The exact activity string “Manual Fraud Check” occurs **1** time (in CaseID 1002 at 2025-03-01T09:07:13Z).

2️⃣ This snippet covers only March 1, 2025, with just 3 cases and limited activities (e.g., 1 manual fraud check vs. 2 automatic). An analyst might misestimate manual fraud checks' prevalence if assuming this represents the full month-long log, potentially underestimating frequency due to: small sample bias (only 13 events), time-of-day clustering (events from 09:00-10:45Z), and incomplete process visibility (e.g., no repeat instances or different days). Broader patterns or variations across the month could differ significantly from this isolated excerpt. (89 words)
