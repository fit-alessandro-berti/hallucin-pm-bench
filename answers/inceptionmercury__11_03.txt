Subject: Executive Memo: Performance Analysis and Recommendations

Dear COO,

Our recent performance analysis has identified three critical areas where our processes are underperforming based on SLA breaches and high waiting times. The activities in question are:

- **Legal Approval**: Exceeds its SLA of 600 seconds by 300 seconds, with an average waiting time of 600 seconds.
- **Risk Review**: Exceeds its SLA of 300 seconds by 300 seconds, with an average waiting time of 480 seconds.
- **Credit Assessment**: Exceeds its SLA of 240 seconds by 60 seconds, with an average waiting time of 200 seconds.

Recommendations:
- For Legal Approval, implement a streamlined document review process to reduce the average waiting time by at least 50%.
- For Risk Review, introduce automated risk assessment tools to decrease the average waiting time by 25%.
- For Credit Assessment, optimize the credit scoring algorithm to reduce the average waiting time by 10%.

Best regards,

Orion Creditâ€™s Senior Process-Performance Analyst
