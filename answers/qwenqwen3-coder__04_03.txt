**No**

Justification:

**Rule 1 violated**: QE and RA occur once each but **not in the correct order**. RA occurs after Notify_Authorities, which breaks the required sequence of QE followed immediately by RA.

**Rule 2 violated**: VP_Safety_Approval occurs **after** Notify_Authorities, but rule 2 requires that VP must happen **after both QE and RA**. Since NA occurred before VP, this violates the mandatory order.

**Rule 3 violated**: Notify_Authorities occurs **before** RA is complete, which directly violates the requirement that NA must wait until after **both** QE **and** RA are finished.

**Rule 4 satisfied**: Close_Case occurs after Notify_Authorities and after VP_Safety_Approval (which was required by rule 2 for a High severity case), so this rule is followed correctly.

The trace violates multiple core requirements regarding activity order and prerequisites.
