Add a timer boundary event (e.g., `Timer_Escalate`) on `Task_Check` with 48h duration. If exceeded, interrupt flow and escalate—bypassing `GW_Docs` and `Task_RequestDocs`—directly to `Task_Triage` via new sequence flow. This enforces SLA without adding tasks. Escalated claims still triaged on time, meeting compliance. Existing “missing docs” path preserved for non-escalated cases. No new activities — only event + flow modification. Reference: attach timer to `Task_Check`, connect output to `Task_Triage`.
