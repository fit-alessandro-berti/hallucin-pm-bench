Add a timer boundary event to the "Check Completeness" task (Task_Check) with a 48-hour duration. If the timer expires before Task_Check completes, the process should bypass to "Triage Claim" (Task_Triage) to ensure SLA compliance. Connect the timer boundary event directly to Task_Triage using a new sequence flow, and remove the existing path through GW_Docs and Task_RequestDocs for the timeout case. This ensures that even incomplete claims reach triage within 48 hours, satisfying the auto-escalation requirement without adding new tasks.
