   a. This log fragment only represents activity over a single day (May 1, 2025), which is a very limited timeframe and not representative of a full month.  
   b. The fragment is a sample of cases; only one case (A1002) contains this activity, introducing potential bias if the sampling is not representative of the entire population of cases (e.g., only A1002 had fraud checks, others never did).
