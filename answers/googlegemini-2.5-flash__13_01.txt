Here are the answers to your questions based on the provided event-log fragment:

1.  **Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**
    The activity "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs **1** time.
2.  **What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**
    There are 18 total logged events. "Manual_Fraud_Check" occurs 1 time.
    (1 / 18) * 100 = 5.555...%
    Rounded to two decimal places, this represents **5.56%** of all logged events.
3.  **List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**
    The case identifier that contains "Manual_Fraud_Check" is **A1002**.
4.  **A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give two sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**
    1.  **Limited Time Window:** The log fragment covers only a few hours of a single day (May 1st, 2025). Process activities and their frequencies, especially for events like fraud checks, can vary significantly across different times of day, days of the week, or different weeks/months due to operational patterns, staffing, or external factors. Estimating a *monthly* frequency from such a short, single-day snapshot would likely not be representative of the entire month.
    2.  **Small Sample Size of Cases:** The fragment includes only 4 distinct cases (A1001 to A1004). Manual fraud checks are likely infrequent or condition-dependent events. A sample of only four cases is too small to reliably capture the true proportion or frequency of such events across the much larger population of cases that would occur over an entire month. This small sample might coincidentally include (or exclude) a disproportionate number of fraud checks, leading to an unreliable monthly estimate.
