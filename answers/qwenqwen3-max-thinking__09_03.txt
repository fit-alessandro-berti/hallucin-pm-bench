It is impossible to compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the activity “Approve Invoice” because the event-log stub (Artefact A) has all row data—including every timestamp and case detail—redacted. Although the column names indicate that start_time and complete_time would be available, their actual values are absent, rendering numerical calculation infeasible. Without even a single observed duration for the activity, no statistical measures can be derived from the provided artefacts.
