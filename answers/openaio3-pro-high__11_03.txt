Executive Memo – Process SLA Hotspots

Review of current throughput data flags three activities that both break their SLA and create the longest queues.

Legal Approval averages 900 s vs. a 600 s SLA—300 s over—with a 600 s wait across 465 cases.  
Risk Review needs 600 s vs. 300 s SLA—also 300 s over—while customers queue 480 s for 480 cases.  
Credit Assessment takes 300 s vs. 240 s SLA—60 s over—and keeps 1,175 cases waiting 200 s.  

Together these steps drive the process’s largest delays and threaten end-to-end commitments.

Recommendations  
• Add legal reviewers until waiting time falls from 600 s to ≤300 s, which would bring the 900 s average back within the 600 s SLA.  
• Allocate senior underwriters to Risk Review’s 480 s queue, targeting a 300 s throughput cut to meet the 300 s SLA.  
• Apply automated scoring to the 1,175 Credit Assessments to remove the 60 s excess and erase the 200 s wait.
