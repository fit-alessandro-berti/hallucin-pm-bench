Re: Worst-Performing Activities & Recommendations

Three activities underperform based on SLA breaches and high waiting times:

1. **Risk Review**
   - SLA breach: 300 seconds (exceeds by 300s)
   - Action: Automate initial risk-screening steps to reduce manual oversight.

2. **Legal Approval**
   - SLA breach: 300 seconds (exceeds by 300s)
   - Action: Pre-populate approval templates with pre-checked compliance clauses.

3. **Credit Assessment**
   - SLA breach: 60 seconds (exceeds by 60s)
   - Action: Deploy decision-tree algorithms to auto-categorize high/medium-low risk cases.

Deadlines met for all given metrics. No assumptions applied.
