Average throughput versus target SLA identifies three activities where SLA breaches coincide with the highest average waiting times. Legal Approval and Risk Review tie for the largest SLA overage (+300s), and their average waiting times (600s and 480s) are the two highest in the table. Legal Approval averages 900s throughput vs a 600s SLA (+300s) with 600s average waiting across 465 cases. Risk Review averages 600s throughput vs a 300s SLA (+300s) with 480s average waiting across 480 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s throughput vs a 240s SLA (+60s) with 200s average waiting across 1,175 cases. In each activity, the SLA overage (+300s/+300s/+60s) is less than the average waiting time (600s/480s/200s).  

- Legal Approval: to remove the +300s gap, cut average waiting by 300s (600s→300s) across 465 cases.  
- Risk Review: to remove the +300s gap, cut average waiting by 300s (480s→180s) across 480 cases.  
- Credit Assessment: to remove the +60s gap, cut average waiting by 60s (200s→140s) across 1,175 cases.
