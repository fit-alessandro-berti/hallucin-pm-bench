**No.** It is impossible for transition **T5 to fire before T3** in any reachable marking.

### Proof:

We examine the structure of the net and the necessary conditions for enabling and firing each transition.

- **Initial marking**:  
  `M₀ = [p0=1, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0]`

#### Step 1: What must happen first?
- Only **T1** is enabled in `M₀`, because:
  - T1 requires 1 token in **p0** → satisfied.
  - All other transitions require tokens in places that are initially empty (e.g., T2 needs p1, T3 needs p2, T4/T5 need p3/p4).

After **T1** fires:
- `M₁ = [p0=0, p1=1, p2=1, p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0]`

#### Step 2: Next possible transitions
In `M₁`, two transitions are enabled:
- **T2**: consumes p1 → produces p3  
- **T3**: consumes p2 → produces p4

Either T2 or T3 may fire next — or even in parallel (since the net is safe and they consume distinct places).

Now consider the **prerequisites for T5 to fire**:
- **T5** requires:
  - 1 token in **p3** (normal arc), **and**
  - 0 tokens in **p4** (inhibitor arc).

So to fire T5, we **must have p3 ≥ 1** and **p4 = 0**.

Let’s analyze all possible paths from `M₀` and see when (or whether) T5 becomes enabled.

### Case analysis:

#### **Case A: T2 fires before T3**
- After T2:  
  `M₂ = [p0=0, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0, p5=0, p6=0]`  
  Now:
  - p3 = 1 ✅  
  - p4 = 0 ✅  
  ⇒ **T5 is enabled** here.

So in this branch, **T5 can fire before T3**? Wait — but T3 has not fired *yet*, and T5 is enabled *now*, before T3.  
Hold on — this suggests T5 *could* fire before T3.

But the question is: **"In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition T5 to fire *before* transition T3?"**

Here, in this scenario, T5 fires *before* T3 (T1 → T2 → T5, with T3 not fired yet). So **yes**? But wait — is this net *safe*? Yes — given safe. Does T5 actually consume p3? Yes: T5: p3 → p6 (plus inhibitor on p4). So after T5, p3 becomes 0.

So the sequence T1 → T2 → T5 is valid? Let’s verify.

After T2:  
`[p3=1, p4=0]` → T5 enabled. Fire T5: consumes p3, produces p6.  
Result:  
`[p3=0, p6=1]`.

So indeed, T5 fires *before* T3 (T3 never fired in this sequence).

But wait — is there any rule preventing this? Let’s double-check transition definitions.

> T5 : p3 –|p4 → p6  
This is a **pure inhibitor arc**: T5 consumes 1 token from p3 (normal input), and has an inhibitor arc from p4 (no token in p4 required to enable). It does **not** require a token in p4 — it just requires **zero**.

So yes, T5 is enabled in `M₂ = [p3=1, p4=0]`.

Therefore, **T5 can fire before T3**, e.g., in the sequence:
**T1 → T2 → T5**

So why did I initially say “no”? Because I mistakenly assumed T3 must fire first. But no — T3 and T5 are *not* ordered; only T4 requires both p3 and p4.

Let’s double-check if T5 firing before T3 leads to any contradiction.

Final marking after T1 → T2 → T5:
- p0=0, p1=0, p2=1 (unchanged), p3=0, p4=0, p5=0, p6=1

All places ≤1 → safe. Yes.

So **yes**, it is possible.

But wait — the problem says the net is **safe**, and we've preserved safety.

So why does the question ask this? Maybe to catch a misconception that “join must happen before alternative”.

But the answer is **yes**.

Let’s re-read the question carefully:

> In any reachable marking of this net, **is it possible for transition T5 to fire *before* transition T3?**

Interpretation: Does there exist *some* reachable marking *preceding* a T5 firing, such that in the full run, T5 fires earlier than T3? Or more precisely: Is there a run where T5 fires at some point, and the first occurrence of T5 happens at a time strictly before the first occurrence of T3?

Yes — sequence: **T1, then T2, then T5** (T3 never fires, or fires later — but in this run, it doesn’t fire at all before T5).

Even better: sequence: **T1 → T2 → T5 → T3**

After T5, p3=0, so T3 (which consumes p2) can still fire independently — p2 is still 1.

Wait — after T5: p2=1 still (since T5 doesn’t touch p2), p4=0, so T3 is still enabled, and can fire next: T3 consumes p2 → produces p4.

Then marking: p4=1, and p3=0, p4=1 → now T5 disabled (because p4>0), but T4 is now disabled because p3=0.

No problem.

So the sequence T1 → T2 → T5 → T3 is fully valid.

Therefore, **yes**, T5 can fire before T3.

But wait — earlier I thought: T3 consumes p2, and T5 has no dependency on p2 — fine.

Thus, the answer should be **yes**.

Hold on — double-check T2: p1 → p3  
T3: p2 → p4  
T5: p3 –|p4 → p6

Yes.

Initial: only p0=1  
→ T1 enabled: consumes p0, produces p1 and p2  
→ Now p1=1, p2=1  
→ Now both T2 and T3 enabled  
→ If we pick T2 first: p3=1  
→ Now T5 is enabled (p3=1, p4=0)  
→ T5 fires: p6=1  
→ Now p3=0  
→ T3 can still fire: p2=1 → p4=1  
→ all good.

Thus, **T5 fires before T3**.

✅ So answer is **yes**.

But wait — the user may be tricked by the inhibitor arc, thinking it somehow forces p4 to be present before T5, but no — inhibitor just *forbids* T5 when p4>0. Zero tokens *enables* it.

Thus, final answer:

---

**Yes.**  
One concrete firing sequence is:  
**T1 → T2 → T5**

- Start: `M₀ = (1,0,0,0,0,0,0)`  
- After **T1**: `(0,1,1,0,0,0,0)`  
- After **T2**: `(0,0,1,1,0,0,0)` — T2 enabled (p1=1); produces p3=1  
- Now **T5** enabled: p3=1 and p4=0 ⇒ fires, producing p6  
- After **T5**: `(0,0,1,0,0,0,1)`  

T3 has not fired yet — in fact, it hasn't fired *at all* before T5. Even if we continue with **T3**, it would fire *after* T5.

Thus, **T5 fires before T3**.

✅

**Answer: Yes.**
