### Executive Memo: Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance Analysis

**To: COO, Acme Insurance**  
**From: Senior Process-Performance Analyst**  
**Date: [Current Date]**  
**Subject: Key Bottlenecks in Claims Handling Process**

Based on the Q1-2025 dashboard, the three worst-performing activities are Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment. These were identified by their combination of low throughput, high wait/processing times, elevated rework rates, and SLA breaches relative to peers.

1. **Request_Documents** underperforms due to the highest average wait time (150 min), lowest throughput (190 cases/day), and highest rework rate (22.0%), indicating severe queuing and frequent repetitions. **Recommendation:** Implement automated document submission portals to reduce wait time by targeting the 150-min queue, potentially cutting rework by 50% based on similar industry benchmarks.

2. **Review_Documents** shows poor performance with the highest average processing time (25 min), highest standard deviation (9 min), and highest SLA breach rate (12.4%), plus low throughput (185 cases/day). **Recommendation:** Standardize review checklists to lower processing time and variability, aiming to reduce SLA breaches below 5% by addressing the 9-min stdev.

3. **Initial_Assessment** lags with elevated wait time (18 min), processing time (12 min), and SLA breach rate (3.2%) compared to upstream activities, contributing to downstream throughput drops. **Recommendation:** Allocate additional staff during peak hours to slash wait time from 18 to under 10 min, directly improving SLA compliance based on the 3.2% breach data.

These actions could boost overall process efficiency by 15-20%. Further analysis recommended.
