The stated fact is inaccurate because Validate_Payment does not always follow Receive_Order across all cases in the log. For case C001 (lines 1-2), it follows immediately after Receive_Order. For C002 (lines 3-5), it follows Receive_Order after Check_Inventory. For C004 (lines 8-9), it follows Receive_Order directly. However, for C003 (lines 6-7), Validate_Payment precedes Receive_Order, violating the "always follows" condition. Similarly, for C005 (line 11), Validate_Payment occurs without any prior Receive_Order in that case, further disproving the claim.
