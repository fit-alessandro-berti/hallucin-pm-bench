Here are the answers to your questions based **exclusively** on the provided 18 log lines:

---

### **1. Exactly how many times does the activity “Manual_Fraud_Check” occur in this fragment?**

---

### **2. What percentage of *all* logged events does this represent? (Round to two decimal places.)**

### **3. List the case identifier(s) that contain “Manual_Fraud_Check”.**
**Answer:** **A1002**.

### **4. A data scientist uses only this fragment to estimate the monthly frequency of manual fraud checks. Give **two** sampling-related reasons why that estimate is unreliable.**
**Answer:**
1. **Small sample size**: The fragment contains only **1 occurrence** of "Manual_Fraud_Check" out of 18 events (5.56%). With such a tiny sample, the estimate is highly sensitive to random variation and may not reflect the true underlying frequency.
2. **Lack of temporal representativeness**: The fragment covers only **a few hours** (from 09:00 to 14:05 on a single day). Monthly fraud patterns could vary due to:
   - Seasonal trends (e.g., higher fraud during holidays),
   - Daily/weekly cycles (e.g., more checks on weekends),
   - Outliers or anomalies not captured in this short window.
   The fragment does not account for these variations, making the estimate non-generalizable to a full month.
