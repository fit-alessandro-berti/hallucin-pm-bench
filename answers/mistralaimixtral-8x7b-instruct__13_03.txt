1. The string **"Manual Fraud Check"** occurs exactly **2 times** in this excerpt, in the cases with CaseID 1002 and 1003.

2. An analyst might misestimate the frequency of manual fraud checks in the full log for several reasons based on this snippet:
   - First, this snippet only contains data from a single day, while the full log covers a whole month. The rate of manual fraud checks could be different on other days.
   - Second, the sample is not random and appears to be sorted by timestamp. If there's a temporal pattern in how these cases were selected, it could skew the perceived frequency of manual fraud checks.
   - Lastly, the number of applications (cases) in this snippet is small, and the presence of manual fraud checks in two out of three cases could overstate their prevalence. In a larger sample, the proportion could be significantly lower.
