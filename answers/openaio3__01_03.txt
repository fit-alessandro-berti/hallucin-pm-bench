a) Decision points in the SMALL-BUSINESS loan process  

1. Tri-Color-Risk-Check: the three scorecards (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow) are combined to label the application Low, Medium, or High risk.  
2. Manual-Underwriting-Bypass: if the risk label is Low OR Medium AND the amount requested is ≤ €250 000, step 5 is skipped; otherwise a Manual Underwriting Review is performed.  
3. “TriVote” Gate: the loan passes only when at least any two of the three roles (Credit Lead, Regulatory Liaison, Sustainability Officer) give their approval; otherwise it is rejected.  
4. Applicant-Confirmation Gate: the process proceeds to finalisation only if the borrower returns both a signed Offer Sheet 77 and an ID Matrix Declaration; absence of either halts the deal.
