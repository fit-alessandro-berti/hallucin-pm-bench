Based on the descriptions of the warehouse-related BPMN models—specifically focusing on **Process B – Warehouse_Replenishment**—we can identify concurrent execution paths:

1. **Parallel Split #1 – Quality_Check**
   - This task can execute in parallel with any task that comes after the initial receive event.

2. **Parallel Split #2 – Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement**
   - These tasks within the same parallel path can execute concurrently.

Therefore, the sets of concurrent tasks are:

**Set 1:** Quality_Check  
**Set 2:** Generate_Replenishment_Report and Notify_Procurement  
**Set 3:** Notify_Procurement
