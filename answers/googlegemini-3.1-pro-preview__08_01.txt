**Yes**, it is possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3. 

**Concrete firing sequence:**  
T1 → T2 → T5

**Brief Justification:**  
1. **Start:** The initial marking has `p0=1` (all other places 0). Transition **T1** is enabled.
2. **Fire T1:** This removes the token from `p0` and places one token each in `p1` and `p2` (parallel split). 
3. **Fire T2:** The token in `p1` enables **T2**. Firing it consumes `p1` and places a token in `p3`. Transition T3 remains unfired, so its output place `p4` still has 0 tokens.
4. **Fire T5:** At this exact marking (`p2=1`, `p3=1`, `p4=0`), transition **T5** becomes enabled. It requires one token in `p3` (which it has) and zero tokens in `p4` via the inhibitor arc (which is satisfied because T3 has not yet fired). Thus, T5 successfully fires before T3.
