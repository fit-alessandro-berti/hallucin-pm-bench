**Answer:** **No**  

**Justification:**  
In the given log excerpt, *“Validate_Payment”* is **not** always immediately after *“Receive_Order”*.  

Evidence from cases:

- **C001:** Receive_Order → *Validate_Payment* ✅ (immediate)  
- **C002:** Receive_Order → **Pack_Items** → Validate_Payment ❌ (Pack_Items occurs in between)  
- **C003:** Receive_Order → *Validate_Payment* ✅ (immediate)  
- **C004:** Receive_Order → **Check_Fraud** → Validate_Payment ❌ (Check_Fraud occurs in between)  

Thus, the FACT is incorrect because in **C002** and **C004**, there is at least one other activity between *Receive_Order* and *Validate_Payment*.
