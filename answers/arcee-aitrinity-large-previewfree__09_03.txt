I cannot compute the average cycle time, standard deviation, or confidence interval for the "Approve Invoice" activity because the event log contains no actual timestamp values or case data—only the column headers are provided. Without start and complete times for each occurrence of the activity, it is impossible to derive durations or perform any statistical calculation.
