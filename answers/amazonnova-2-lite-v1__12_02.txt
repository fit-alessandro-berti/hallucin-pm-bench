**No**

The stated fact is **not** accurate. While *Validate_Payment* does follow *Receive_Order* in some cases (e.g., case C001: *Receive_Order* at line 1 is followed by *Validate_Payment* at line 2, and case C004: *Receive_Order* at line 8 is followed by *Validate_Payment* at line 9), there are instances where *Validate_Payment* occurs **before** *Receive_Order*. Specifically, in case C003, *Validate_Payment* is recorded at line 6, and *Receive_Order* occurs later at line 7. Similarly, in case C005, *Validate_Payment* appears at line 11, while there is no subsequent *Receive_Order* for that case—instead, *Cancel_Order* follows at line 12. These examples disprove the claim that *Validate_Payment* **always** follows *Receive_Order*.
