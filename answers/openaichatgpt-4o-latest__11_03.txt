Subject: SLA and Waiting Time Performance – Key Issues and Targeted Actions  

Our review identifies the three activities with the most critical performance gaps when assessed jointly by SLA breaches and elevated average waiting times:  

1. Risk Review exceeds its 300-second SLA by 300 seconds (100% over) and has the highest average waiting time at 480 seconds.  
2. Legal Approval exceeds its 600-second SLA by 300 seconds (50% over) and has the second-highest average waiting time at 600 seconds.  
3. Credit Assessment exceeds its 240-second SLA by 60 seconds (25% over), with a high waiting time of 200 seconds.  

Recommendations:  
• Prioritize workflow automation or alternative resourcing for Risk Review to reduce its 480 seconds of queuing.  
• Reallocate capacity or adjust approval thresholds in Legal Approval to address its 600-second waiting bottleneck.  
• Implement pre-screening to minimize non-viable applications entering the Credit Assessment stage, targeting its 200-second delay.
