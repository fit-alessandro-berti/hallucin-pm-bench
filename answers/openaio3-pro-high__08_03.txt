Yes – T5 can fire before T3.

Shortest firing sequence (length 4):
1. T1  p0 → pa + pb  
2. T2b pa → pd  
3. T4  pb → pe  
4. T5  pd + pe → pf  (T5 fires; T3 has never fired)

Markings after every step  
• M0: p0=1  
• M1 (after T1): pa=1, pb=1  
• M2 (after T2b): pd=1, pb=1  
• M3 (after T4): pd=1, pe=1  
• M4 (after T5): pf=1

Why this is shortest:  
• T5 needs one token in pd and one in pe.  
• pe can be produced only by T4 (so T4 must occur once).  
• If T3 is not allowed before T5, pd must be produced by T2b (one firing).  
• Both T4 and T2b need the tokens that T1 produces from the initial marking.  
Thus at least the four transitions {T1, T2b, T4, T5} must fire; 4 is minimal, and the sequence above achieves it, with T5 occurring before any firing of T3.
