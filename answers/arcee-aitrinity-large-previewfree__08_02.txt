**Question 1:** No, it is not possible for T5 to fire before T3.

**Explanation:** T5 requires both P2 and P5 to be marked to fire. P2 can only be marked by T1, which also marks P1. For T5 to fire before T3, we'd need P5 marked without T3 firing. However, P5 can only be marked by T4, which requires P4. P4 can be marked by either T2+T7 (consuming P1) or T3 (consuming P2). If T3 hasn't fired, P2 remains marked, but P4 must still be marked by T2+T7, which consumes P1 and leaves P2 available. However, this path doesn't produce P5 without T3. The synchronization constraint makes T5 impossible before T3.

**Question 2:** Not applicable (answer is "no").
