**No.**

**Justification:**

The FACT states that "Validate_Payment" *always* occurs immediately after "Receive_Order." However, the event log excerpt shows the following:

*   **C001:** Receive\_Order, Validate\_Payment (separated by Pack\_Items)
*   **C002:** Receive\_Order, Pack\_Items, Validate\_Payment (separated by nothing)
*   **C003:** Receive\_Order, Validate\_Payment, Ship\_Order (separated by nothing)
*   **C004:** Receive\_Order, Check\_Fraud, Validate\_Payment, Pack\_Items (separated by Check\_Fraud)

Case C001 demonstrates that "Pack\_Items" can occur *between* "Receive\_Order" and "Validate\_Payment". Case C004 further confirms this, as "Check\_Fraud" appears between "Receive\_Order" and "Validate\_Payment". Therefore, the FACT that "Validate\_Payment" *always* follows directly after "Receive\_Order" is not accurate based on the provided data.
