Justification: The fact is inaccurate because "Validate_Payment" does not always occur immediately after "Receive_Order" in the log. In CaseID C001, the sequence is Receive_Order → Validate_Payment (consistent with the fact). In CaseID C003, the sequence is Receive_Order → Validate_Payment (consistent with the fact). However, in CaseID C002, the sequence is Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment ("Pack_Items" occurs in between, contradicting the fact). In CaseID C004, the sequence is Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment ("Check_Fraud" occurs in between, contradicting the fact).
