No. The event log contradicts the claim in multiple cases:
- Case 1001: Update_Inventory occurs before Authorize_Refund, and Authorize_Refund is followed by Refund_Issued (not Update_Inventory).
- Case 1002: No Update_Inventory at all; Authorize_Refund is followed by Refund_Issued.
- Case 1003: Update_Inventory occurs earlier; Authorize_Refund happens later after Quality_Check.

Therefore, “Authorize_Refund” is not immediately before “Update_Inventory” in any shown case.
