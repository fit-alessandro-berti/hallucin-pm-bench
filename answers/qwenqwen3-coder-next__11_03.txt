Subject: Urgent SLA Performance concerns in Loan Processing Pipeline  

Dear COO,  

Three activities significantly underperform against SLAs and exhibit high waiting times:  

- **Risk Review**: 600s throughput time vs. 300s target (100% over SLA); waiting time of 480s constitutes 80% of total cycle time.  
- **Legal Approval**: 900s throughput time vs. 600s target (50% over SLA); waiting time of 600s equals 67% of total cycle time.  
- **Credit Assessment**: 300s throughput time vs. 240s target (25% over SLA); waiting time of 200s accounts for 67% of total cycle time.  

Recommendations:  
- Introduce parallel risk-score validation layers for Risk Review to reduce dependent wait time and cut throughput by ≥30%.  
- Pre-approve legal templates for standard loan types and mandate automated document assembly before submission to Legal Approval, targeting ≤450s throughput.  
- Implement real-time data-pull into Credit Assessment workflows (e.g., credit bureau API batching) to reduce waiting time from 200s to ≤120s.
