**Decision points in Contoso’s refund process**

1. **Triage_Agent_Validate_Eligibility**  
   - **Decision**: Is the claim eligible based on flight and weather conditions?  
   - **Key outcome**:  
     - If eligible → case can move forward to **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**.  
     - If not eligible → process cannot legitimately continue toward refund.  
   - **Required documents**:  
     - *RefundRequestForm* (information submitted by the passenger)  
     - *FlightManifest* (to verify passenger and flight details)  
     - *WeatherReport* (to check conditions affecting eligibility)

2. **Finance_Controller_PreApprove**  
   - **Decision**: Should the claim be financially pre-approved?  
   - **Key outcome**:  
     - If pre-approved:  
       - If refund amount ≤ €1 000 → may proceed directly toward **Process_Refund_Payment**.  
       - If refund amount > €1 000 → must go to **Senior_Auditor_Review** first.  
     - If not pre-approved → refund payment cannot proceed.  
   - **Required document**:  
     - *EligibilityChecklist* (basis for the controller’s sign-off)

3. **High-value branch (amount > €1 000)**  
   - **Decision**: Is the refund amount **greater than €1 000**?  
   - **Key outcome**:  
     - If **> €1 000** → route to **Senior_Auditor_Review** (mandatory before payment).  
     - If **≤ €1 000** → **Senior_Auditor_Review** is skipped; payment can proceed once pre-approved.  
   - **Documents involved**:  
     - No additional document is introduced here; the branch relies on the refund amount already determined in the case (e.g., from the *RefundRequestForm* and subsequent assessment).

4. **Senior_Auditor_Review** (for high-value claims only)  
   - **Decision**: Should the high-value refund be approved after audit review?  
   - **Key outcome**:  
     - If approved → **Process_Refund_Payment** may begin (assuming *BankTransferAuthorization* will be/has been prepared).  
     - If not approved → refund payment cannot proceed.  
   - **Required document**:  
     - *AuditTrail* (must be included in the review)

5. **Gate before Process_Refund_Payment**  
   - **Decision condition**: Can payment processing start?  
   - **Required prior approvals/steps**:  
     - **Finance_Controller_PreApprove** must have succeeded.  
     - For refund amount > €1 000, **Senior_Auditor_Review** must be completed.  
   - **Required document to execute payment**:  
     - *BankTransferAuthorization* (must be present and signed before payment is processed)
