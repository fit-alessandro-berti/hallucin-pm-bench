 Answer 1: No, it is not possible for transition T5 to fire before transition T3.

Answer 2: In the given Petri net, transition T5 has an input place (P5) that can only be reached through transition T4, which requires P4 as input. Transition T4, in turn, can only be fired after either T2 or T3, which are the only transitions that produce P4. Therefore, T3 must fire before T5 in any reachable marking, making it impossible for T5 to fire before T3.
