Non-compliant

1. The total PO amount (€12,300) exceeds €10,000, so the process must include **two approvals** (Procurement Officer and CFO) **before** `Issue_PO`.  
   - The trace shows `Approve_PO` (role: Procurement_Officer) at step 2 and `Approve_PO_CFO` (role: CFO) at step 3, both before `Issue_PO` at step 5, satisfying this requirement.

2. Since `Expedite_Flag` activity occurred at step 4, **`Risk_Assessment` must have occurred before** `Ship_Goods` (step 8).  
   - `Risk_Assessment` is at step 9, which is **after** `Ship_Goods`, thus violating the rule requiring `Risk_Assessment` to occur **before** `Ship_Goods`.

3. After `Goods_Received` (step 6), `Three_way_match` (step 10) occurs.  
   - The rule states `Three_way_match` must be completed **within the next two activities** (distance ≤ 2).  
   - Here, `Goods_Received` is at step 6, and `Three_way_match` is at step 10, which is beyond the next two activities (steps 7-8 are within 2 steps).  
   - Since `Three_way_match` occurs 4 steps after `Goods_Received`, this condition is violated.

4. No activity by role **Intern** may **directly follow** an activity by **CFO**.  
   - The CFO activity (`Approve_PO_CFO`) is at step 3, followed directly by `Expedite_Flag` at step 4, which is by **System**, not Intern, so this is compliant.

5. The trace ends with `Archive_Record` at step 11, and nothing occurs afterward, satisfying the requirement.

**Summary:**  
- The critical violations are the occurrence of `Risk_Assessment` after `Ship_Goods` (violating rule 2), and `Three_way_match` not within two activities after `Goods_Received` (violating rule 3).  
- The other rules are satisfied.

**Final verdict:** **Non-compliant**
