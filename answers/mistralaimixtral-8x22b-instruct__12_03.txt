1. **No**

2. **Justification:**
   - **Case C002:** The sequence is `Receive_Order → Pack_Items → Validate_Payment`. Here, `Validate_Payment` does **not** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` (it is preceded by `Pack_Items`).
   - **Case C004:** The sequence is `Receive_Order → Check_Fraud → Validate_Payment`. Here, `Validate_Payment` does **not** occur immediately after `Receive_Order` (it is preceded by `Check_Fraud`).

The FACT is incorrect because there are cases where `Validate_Payment` does not follow `Receive_Order` directly.
