Non-compliant

Justification:
According to Rule 2, when `Expedite_Flag` is present (event #4), `Risk_Assessment` MUST occur BEFORE the first `Ship_Goods`. However, in this trace, `Ship_Goods` (event #8) occurs before `Risk_Assessment` (event #9), which violates Rule 2.

All other rules are satisfied:
- Rule 1: Two approvals (PO_Officer #2 and CFO #3) occur before Issue_PO (#5)
- Rule 3: Three_way_match (#10) occurs within 2 activities after Goods_Received (#6)
- Rule 4: No Intern activity directly follows a CFO activity
- Rule 5: Trace ends with Archive_Record with nothing after it

But the violation of Rule 2 alone makes the trace non-compliant.
