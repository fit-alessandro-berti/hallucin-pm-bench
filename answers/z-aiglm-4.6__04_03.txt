**No**

**Justification:**

*   **Rule 1 (Satisfied):** `Quality_Engineer_Review` (QE) and `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) each occur once, and in the correct order (QE before RA).
*   **Rule 2 (Satisfied):** Since `severity = "High"`, `VP_Safety_Approval` (VP) occurs after both QE and RA.
*   **Rule 3 (Violated):** `Notify_Authorities` (NA) occurs before `Regulatory_Affairs_Review` (RA) is complete. The rule requires NA to occur after **both** QE and RA.
*   **Rule 4 (Satisfied):** `Close_Case` (CC) occurs after both NA and VP.
