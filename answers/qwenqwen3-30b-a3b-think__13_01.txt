4. **Two sampling-related reasons for unreliability**:  
   - **Small sample size**: The fragment includes only 18 events, which is insufficient to generalize monthly trends.  
   - **Limited case diversity**: The fragment includes only one case (A1002) with "Manual_Fraud_Check," potentially underrepresenting its true frequency across all cases.
