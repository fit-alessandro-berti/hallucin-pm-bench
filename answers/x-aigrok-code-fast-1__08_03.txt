Yes, it is possible.

A shortest firing sequence is: T1, T2b, T4, T5.

In this sequence, T5 fires starting from a reachable marking where pd and pe each have 1 token (and pc has 0), while no T3 has been fired yet (because pc was never produced in the path to T5). The sequence is shortest as it uses the minimum firings needed to produce pd (via T2b) and pe, then enable T5. (Alternative shortest sequence producing pd/pe in the other order is T1, T4, T2b, T5.) After this sequence, T3 becomes possible to fire (via T6 enabling it), but it was not fired before T5.
