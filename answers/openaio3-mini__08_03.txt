Yes, it is possible. One shortest firing sequence is:

 T1, then T2b, then T4, and finally T5

Explanation:
1. Start with the initial marking: p0 = 1.
2. T1 fires (with input p0) and produces tokens in pa and pb.
3. T2b fires (with input pa) and produces a token in pd, bypassing the need for the “normal” path (T2 followed by T3).
4. T4 fires (with input pb) and produces a token in pe.
5. With tokens now in pd and pe, T5 becomes enabled and can fire. Notice that T3 (which would have required a token in pc from T2) has not been fired. 

Thus, the firing sequence T1, T2b, T4, T5 shows that T5 can indeed fire before T3.
