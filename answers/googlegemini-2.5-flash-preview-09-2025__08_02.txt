The initial marking is $M_0 = \{ P0 \}$.

**Question 1.** In any reachable marking, is it possible for transition **T5** to fire **before** transition **T3**?

To fire:
*   $T3$ requires $P2$.
*   $T5$ requires $P2$ and $P5$.

$P2$ is generated only by $T1$: $T1: \{ P0 \} \rightarrow \{ P1, P2 \}$.
$P5$ is generated only by $T4$: $T4: \{ P4 \} \rightarrow \{ P5 \}$.

For $T5$ to fire, both $P2$ and $P5$ must be available. $P2$ is available after $T1$ fires. $P5$ results from the sequence $T1 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow T4$.

Consider the steps required to enable $T5$:
1.  Enable $P2$: $T1$ must fire.
    $M_0=\{P0\} \xrightarrow{T1} M_1=\{P1, P2\}$.
2.  Enable $P5$: $T4$ must fire. $T4$ requires $P4$.
    $P4$ is generated by $T7$ or $T3$.
    *   Path via $T7$: $P1 \xrightarrow{T2} P3 \xrightarrow{T7} P4$.
    *   Path via $T3$: $P2 \xrightarrow{T3} P4$.

If $T3$ fires, it consumes $P2$. If $P2$ is consumed by $T3$, $T5$ cannot fire, as $P2$ is a prerequisite for $T5$.
The problem asks if $T5$ can fire **before** $T3$.

If $T5$ fires, $P2$ must be present. If $T3$ has not fired, $P2$ is still present (assuming it hasn't been consumed by $T5$ yet, which is what we are testing).

For $T5$ to fire $(P2, P5)$, we need the sequence:
1. $T1$ fires: $M_1=\{P1, P2\}$. $P2$ is available for $T5$ (and $T3$).
2. We must generate $P5$. This requires $T4$, which requires $P4$.

Case 1: $P4$ generated via $T7$ (does not consume $P2$).
$M_1=\{P1, P2\} \xrightarrow{T2} M_2=\{P3, P2\}$ (T2 consumes P1)
$M_2=\{P3, P2\} \xrightarrow{T7} M_3=\{P4, P2\}$ (T7 consumes P3)
$M_3=\{P4, P2\} \xrightarrow{T4} M_4=\{P5, P2\}$ (T4 consumes P4)
In $M_4$, both $P2$ and $P5$ are available. $T3$ requires $P2$. $T5$ requires $P2, P5$.

At this point ($M_4$), $T3$ has not fired. Now, $T5$ can fire:
$M_4=\{P5, P2\} \xrightarrow{T5} M_5=\{P6\}$.
This sequence allows $T5$ to fire before $T3$. (In fact, $T3$ never fires in this specific path.)

**Answer 1:** Yes.

**Question 2 (bonus).** If your answer is *yes*, give one minimal firing sequence (as an ordered list of transition names) that demonstrates it; if *no*, explain why no such sequence exists.

**Answer 2:** Minimal firing sequence demonstrating $T5$ firing before $T3$:
(T1, T2, T7, T4, T5)

**Explanation:**
1. **T1** produces $\{P1, P2\}$. $P2$ is retained for $T5$.
2. **T2** consumes $P1$, producing $P3$.
3. **T7** consumes $P3$, producing $P4$.
4. **T4** consumes $P4$, producing $P5$.
5. Marking is now $\{P2, P5\}$. Since **T3** has not fired (and therefore $P2$ is available), **T5** is enabled by $\{P2, P5\}$ and fires, successfully consuming $P2$ before $T3$ gets a chance to. $T3$ is never enabled afterward.
