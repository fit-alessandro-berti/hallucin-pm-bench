1. **Count of `Manual_Fraud_Check`**: **1** occurrence (in case **C05**).

2. Percentages (rounded to two decimals):  
   a) Of all events: \(\frac{1}{48}\times 100 = \mathbf{2.08\%}\)  
   b) Of all unique cases: \(\frac{1}{12}\times 100 = \mathbf{8.33\%}\) (1 case out of 12)

3. **Why this can mislead (≤100 words):**  
`Manual_Fraud_Check` appears in only one case, so any pattern tied to it is statistically fragile. In this slice, it is followed by approval (1/1), which could incorrectly suggest a strong rule (“manual check leads to approval”). Performance conclusions can also be distorted because one rare path can look unusually fast or slow versus the dominant path. Predictive models trained on such low-support behavior may overfit noise rather than learn reliable process dynamics.
