Note: The matrix directly assigns each role to the correct activity of a high-value wire transfer using the exact terms as stipulated in the vocabulary policy:
- "Intake Vetting" replaces "Preliminary Assessment"
- "KYC Review" replaces "Customer Due Diligence (CDD)"
- "AML Screening" replaces "Sanctions Check
- "Risk Scoring" replaces "risk rating"
- Escalation for Review acts as described by the scoring, assigned to "Compliance Officer" as they make the decision on winning scores. "Treasury Ops" are informed, not influenced or consulted, just informed and ultimately responsible to release funds and notify the Analyst. Correspondingly, for processes needing negotiation: "Compliance Offficer" is the one making them accountable, hence both roles "Compliance Analyst" and "Compliance Officer" can be held accountable, with possible clarification for context, however, here only 'Compliance Officer' as described.
