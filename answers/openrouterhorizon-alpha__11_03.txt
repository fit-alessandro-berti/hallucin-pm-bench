COO,

Based on the provided throughput, waiting times, and SLAs, the three worst-performing activities—considering both SLA breaches and high waiting time—are Risk Review, Legal Approval, and Credit Assessment.

Risk Review averages 600s throughput against a 300s SLA, exceeding the SLA by 300s, with a high waiting time of 480s across 480 cases. Legal Approval averages 900s versus a 600s SLA, exceeding by 300s, and has the highest waiting time at 600s across 465 cases. Credit Assessment averages 300s versus a 240s SLA, exceeding by 60s, with a waiting time of 200s across 1175 cases.

Recommendations:
• Risk Review: Prioritize queue management to reduce the 480s waiting time for 480 cases, targeting a 300s reduction in waiting to close the 300s SLA gap. 
• Legal Approval: Reallocate capacity to cut the 600s waiting time for 465 cases, aiming to remove the 300s SLA overrun. 
• Credit Assessment: Smooth inflow or pre-triage to reduce the 200s waiting time across 1175 cases, eliminating the 60s SLA breach.
