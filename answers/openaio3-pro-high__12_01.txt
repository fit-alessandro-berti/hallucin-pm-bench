No, the claim is false.

Evidence:
• Case 1001: sequence is … Update_Inventory → Authorize_Refund …, so Authorize_Refund comes after—not immediately before—Update_Inventory.

• Case 1002: Authorize_Refund occurs, but Update_Inventory never appears in the case, so the required “immediately before” relation is impossible.

• Case 1003: … Update_Inventory → Quality_Check → Authorize_Refund …, so Authorize_Refund again comes after Update_Inventory and is separated by another activity.

Since in every observed case the stated ordering is violated, “Authorize_Refund always occurs immediately before Update_Inventory” is inaccurate for this log fragment.
