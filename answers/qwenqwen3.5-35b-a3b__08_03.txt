**Yes.**

**Shortest Firing Sequence:**
`T1, T4, T2b, T5`

**Formal Explanation:**
1.  **Initial State:** The system starts with marking $M_0 = \{p_0: 1\}$. Only transition **T1** is enabled.
2.  **After T1:** Transition **T1** fires, consuming $p_0$ and producing tokens in $p_a$ and $p_b$. Marking becomes $M_1 = \{p_a: 1, p_b: 1\}$.
3.  **Split Paths:** From $p_a$, we can fire **T2** (leading to **T3**) or **T2b** (leading directly to $p_d$). From $p_b$, we can fire **T4** (leading to $p_e$). Since **T2** and **T2b** share the input place $p_a$ and there is only one token, they are mutually exclusive; firing one disables the other.
4.  **Executing Independent Path for T5:** To enable **T5**, we need tokens in both $p_d$ and $p_e$.
    *   Fire **T4** (consumes $p_b$, produces $p_e$). Marking: $\{p_a: 1, p_e: 1\}$.
    *   Fire **T2b** (consumes $p_a$, produces $p_d$). Marking: $\{p_d: 1, p_e: 1\}$.
    *   Note: We chose **T2b** instead of **T2**; therefore, **T3** (which requires $p_c$) has not been enabled or fired.
5.  **Firing T5:** With tokens in both $p_d$ and $p_e$, **T5** is enabled. It fires, consuming both and producing $p_f$.
6.  **Conclusion:** In this sequence, **T5** fires successfully without **T3** ever having fired. Since **T3** requires $p_c$, which is only produced by **T2** (disabled by the choice of **T2b**) or **T6** (which requires **T5** to fire first), **T5** occurs before **T3** (in fact, **T3** is not fired in this minimal sequence).

**Sequence Verification:**
1.  $T1$: $M_0 \to \{p_a, p_b\}$
2.  $T4$: $\{p_a, p_b\} \to \{p_a, p_e\}$
3.  $T2b$: $\{p_a, p_e\} \to \{p_d, p_e\}$
4.  $T5$: $\{p_d, p_e\} \to \{p_f\}$ (T3 not enabled/fired)

This is the shortest sequence (length 4) demonstrating the possibility, as T5 requires two tokens produced by disjoint paths following T1.
