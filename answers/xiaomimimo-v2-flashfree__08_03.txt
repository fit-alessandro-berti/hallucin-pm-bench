**Yes**, it is possible for transition **T5** to fire *before* transition **T3**.

### Shortest Firing Sequence

Here is a shortest firing sequence (4 transitions) that achieves this state (marking `pc=1, pe=1`):

1.  **T1** (`p0 -> pa, pb`)
2.  **T2b** (`pa -> pd`)
3.  **T4** (`pb -> pe`)
4.  **T5** (`pd, pe -> pf`)

After this sequence, the marking is `pf=1`. To make **T3** firable (which requires `pc=1`), the next transition must be **T6** (`pf -> pc`).

**Verification of the constraint:**
*   **T5** fires in step 4.
*   **T3** is not yet firable until **T6** (step 5) produces a token in `pc`.
