No

Rule 1: Violated — QE occurs before RA, but NA happens in between; still, QE and RA each occur once, but order requires QE then RA consecutively? The rule requires order QE then RA; this is satisfied, but they must both occur exactly once, which they do. So Rule 1 satisfied.

Rule 2: Violated — With High severity, VP must happen after both QE and RA; VP occurs after RA, but NA occurs before RA, which affects Rule 3, not Rule 2. VP itself is after both QE and RA, so Rule 2 satisfied.

Rule 3: Violated — NA occurs before RA is complete; it must not occur until after both QE and RA.

Rule 4: Violated — CC occurs after VP and NA, but since NA was premature (Rule 3 violation), CC timing is invalid relative to required sequencing; additionally, CC must be after NA and, if required, after VP; here it is after both, so sequencing is okay contingent on prior compliance, but due to Rule 3 violation the case remains noncompliant.
