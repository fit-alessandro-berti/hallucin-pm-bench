### Decision Points in Acme Bank’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

1. **Underwriter Alignment Gate**  
   - If the two independent risk scores (from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B) differ by ≤ 2 points → continue to Neighbourhood Feedback Check.  
   - If the scores differ by > 2 points → escalate to Harmonisation Committee for tie-break decision, then continue.

2. **Amount Threshold Decision**  
   - If requested amount < €15 000 → system auto-approves (proceed directly to Disburse Funds).  
   - If requested amount ≥ €15 000 → route to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).

3. **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)** – only for amounts ≥ €15 000  
   - Board votes approve or reject → if approved, proceed to Disburse Funds.
