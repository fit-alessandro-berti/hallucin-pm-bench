**To:** COO, Acme Insurance  
**From:** Senior Process-Performance Analyst

**Subject:** Q1-2025 Claims Handling Performance: Key Bottlenecks and Actions  

Q1-2025 data reveals three underperforming activities in the Claims Handling process: Request_Documents, Review_Documents, and Initial_Assessment.  

- **Request_Documents** underperforms due to excessive average wait time (150 min), the highest rework rate (22.0%), and elevated SLA breaches (5.5%), causing a throughput drop from 270 to 190 cases/day. *Action:* Allocate 2 additional staff to cut wait time by 50%, targeting <75 min based on current 150-min baseline.  

- **Review_Documents** shows the highest processing time (25 min), variability (stdev 9 min), rework (5.3%), and SLA breaches (12.4%), with throughput at 185 cases/day. *Action:* Implement a standardized checklist to reduce stdev to <5 min, informed by the 9-min gap.  

- **Initial_Assessment** lags with high wait time (18 min), processing time (12 min), and SLA breaches (3.2%). *Action:* Automate initial triage to shave 6 min off processing, halving the 12-min average.  

These targeted fixes could boost end-to-end efficiency by 15-20%.
