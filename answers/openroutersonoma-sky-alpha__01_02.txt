### Summary of Decision Points in Acme’s Micro-loan Fast-Track Process

The Micro-loan Fast-Track process includes the following explicit decision points, which determine the flow or outcome:

- **Underwriter Alignment Gate**: If the risk scores from Senior Underwriter A and Shadow Underwriter B differ by ≤ 2 points, proceed to Neighbourhood Feedback Check (NFC). Otherwise, escalate to the Harmonisation Committee for a tie-break decision, then continue to NFC.
- **Amount Threshold Decision**: If the requested amount is < €15 000, the system auto-approves and proceeds to Disburse Funds. If the amount is ≥ €15 000, proceed to Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA).
- **Final Micro-loan Board Approval (MBA)**: The board votes to approve (proceed to Disburse Funds) or reject (process ends without disbursement).
